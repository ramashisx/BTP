India plans to ask state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp to consider launching a rights issue to help fund green projects at refining arm Hindustan Petroleum Corp, two sources said, an exercise that could raise about $1.9 billion.

The comments come after India’s finance minister announced a plan this year to provide equity of 300 billion rupees ($3.6 billion) to help the big state oil refiners move towards cleaner energy.

The government is weighing options for HPCL, including directly providing loans at preferential rates, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter. They sought anonymity as they were not authorised to speak with media.

The oil ministry is awaiting a response from the finance ministry on the plan for ONGC to launch a rights issue, one of the sources said.

Based on rights issues previously announced by two other state refiners, an ONGC issue could amount to about 155 billion Indian rupees ($1.86 billion), Reuters calculations show.

In 2018, New Delhi sold its entire stake of 51.1% in HPCL to ONGC, making the firm a subsidiary of India’s top energy explorer. The government holds a stake of 58.93% in ONGC.

Initially, the government had planned to infuse funds into HPCL by allocation of preferential shares, but that risked pushing ONGC’s stake below 50% and ending the government’s indirect control of HPCL, one of the sources said.

ONGC, HPCL and the oil and finance ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

India’s other big state refiners, Indian Oil Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp have announced plans to launch rights issues of 220 billion and 180 billion rupees, respectively.

The government has a 51.5% stake in IOC and 52.98% share in BPCL.

However, a lack of clarity from the government over how to infuse funds into HPCL has delayed the launch of rights issues for IOC and BPCL, sources said. Those issues had earlier been planned by the end of October, sources have said.

Combined, the three refiners aim to invest 3.5 trillion to 4 trillion rupees to reach a goal of net-zero emissions by 2040.",380,-0.9999449253082275

State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) expects commencement of oil production from its Krishna Godavari basin latest by November-end, the company’s management said in a conference call.

Moreover, oil explorer ONGC said gas production from KG-DWN-98/2 block in Bay of Bengal would be ramped up by May or June of 2024.

The company expects oil production from KG basin to reach peak of 45,000 barrels per day (bpd) by financial year 2024-2025. Additionally, gas production from the basin is expected to reach 10 million metric standard cubic metre per day (mmscmd) by FY25.

The much awaited production commencement from ONGC’s deepsea project in the KG basin is expected to arrest the company’s production decline. Initially, oil production from the basin was scheduled to start from November 2021, but the deadline was delayed several times.

ONGC’s total crude production during the second quarter of FY24 dropped 2.1 percent to 5.249 million metric tonnes (MMT) from 5.360 MMT in Q2FY23. Meanwhile, ONGC’s natural gas production declined by 2.8 percent to 5.2 billion cubic meters (BCM) in Q2, as against 5.35 BCM last year. The company blamed decline in some of the matured fields and marginal fields for the production decline.

In Q2, ONGC’s consolidated net profit soared 142.4 percent at Rs 16,553 crore.

The company also plans capital expenditure of Rs 1 lakh crore for petrochemical projects by 2028-2030. ONGC said the investment would be used for two separate projects without disclosing additional details.

OPaL restructing

The company plans to bring in an equity partner in ONGC Petro additions Limited (OPaL) by financial year 2026-2027, after making the petrochemical company sustainable by FY25.

ONGC has proposed to infuse Rs 18,365 crore in OPaL, bringing ONGC’s shareholding to 96 percent and making the petchem company its subsidiary. However, ONGC said it does not intend OPaL to be its subsidiary nor it plans to merge it with ONGC.

“Once OPaL is turned around, the company plans to infuse a new equity partner by FY27. We would then like to bring down our share to 50%, again making OPaL a joint venture,” the company said in the call.

OPaL is a joint venture between ONGC, GAIL (India) and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited (GSPC).",384,-0.2430436134338379

India’s top oil and gas producer ONGC plans to invest about Rs 1 lakh crore in setting up two petrochemical plants to convert crude oil directly into high-value chemical products as it prepares for energy transition, top company officials said on Wednesday.

Crude oil, which companies like ONGC pump out from below seabed and underground reservoirs, is a primary source of energy. It is processed in oil refineries to produce petrol, diesel and jet fuel. With the world looking to transition away from fossil fuels, companies around the globe are looking at new avenues to use crude oil. Petrochemicals are chemical products derived from crude oil and used in the manufacturing of detergents, fibres (polyester, nylon, acrylic etc.), polythene and other man-made plastics. At an investor call on the company’s second-quarter earnings, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Director (Finance) Pomila Jaspal said the firm is looking to build separate oil-to-chemical (O2C) projects.

She, however, did not give details. ""We have plans to invest Rs 10,000 crore by 2028 or 2030 in two projects in two separate states,"" said D Adhikari, Executive Director and Chief of Joint Ventures & Business Development, ONGC, on the investor call. Our plan is to raise petrochemical capacity to 8.5-9 million tonnes by 2030.” One project is likely to be set up by ONGC on its own and the other in a joint venture. The details were not shared in the call. Demand for petrochemicals, the building blocks for plastics, fertilisers and pharmaceuticals, is projected to remain strong due to their wide range of uses across large industries, including construction, automotive and electronics.

Strengthening its chemicals business will also help the state-run oil explorer cut its reliance on the volatile oil market and improve profitability in the long run. ONGC already has two subsidiaries — Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL) and ONGC Petro-Additions Limited (OPaL) that run petrochemical units at Mangalore in Karnataka and Dahej in Gujarat, respectively. While MRPL is a profit-making entity, OPaL has a ""distorted"" capital structure, Adhikari said. To correct this, the ONGC board has approved infusing Rs 18,355 crore capital in OPaL to raise its stake in the firm to over 96 per cent from the current 49.35 per cent, he said.

GAIL (India) Ltd currently has 49.21 per cent and the remaining 1.43 per cent is with Gujarat State Petrochemical Corp (GSPC). Only ONGC is doing the equity infusion, which will all but edge GAIL out of the joint venture. This, he said, would ""temporarily"" make OPaL a subsidiary of ONGC but the company wants to retain the joint venture nature of the company and will look to get a strategic partner in the next three years. The equity infusion will help OPaL turn around and become profitable in fiscal 2024-25, he said. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that global oil demand will plateau by 2030 as penetration of electric vehicles and increased uptake of alternative drive technologies for commercial vehicles ebb demand for fossil fuels. And so energy firms around the world are looking at alternatives.

Crude oil-to-chemicals (COTC) technology allows the direct conversion of crude oil to high-value chemical products instead of traditional transportation fuels. It enables the production of chemicals exceeding 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the barrel-producing chemical feedstock as opposed to about 10 per cent in a non-integrated refinery complex. China and the Middle East account for a majority of COTC plants that have been planned or have started operations. Saudi Aramco and SABIC have announced plans for a COTC plant that will process 4,00,000 barrels per day of Arabian Light crude oil to produce about 9 million tonnes of chemicals per year. ONGC aims to capitalise on this trend, with plans to substantially expand its chemical and petrochemical portfolio from the current 4.2 million tonnes per annum to 8.5-9 million tonnes by 2030, Adhikari said.

The investment in O2C plants is separate from the Rs 1 lakh crore investment ONGC has announced in energy transition projects by 2030, which will help it achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2038. Net zero for a company means achieving a balance between the quantum of greenhouse gases it places into the atmosphere and the amount it takes out.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) is expected to witness production growth in the coming quarters post commencement of production from its Krishna Godavari basin in the Bay of Bengal, said analysts.

In the second quarter of FY24, the oil producer reported a 2.1 percent decline in crude oil production at 5.2 million metric tonne (MMT) and a 2.8 percent reduction in natural gas production.

“On the production front, the decline in oil and gas production is likely to be compensated post commissioning of production from the KG basin in the coming quarters. We build in a volume CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 4 percent and 6 percent for oil and gas over FY23-26E to reach 23.9 MMT of oil and 25.4 billion cubic metre (BCM) of gas in FY26E,” said Prabhudas Lilladher in a report.

The much awaited production commencement from ONGC’s deepsea project in the KG basin is expected to begin in 2023. Production from the project is expected to arrest the company’s production decline. The total oil production from the block is expected to be around 23 MMT and total gas production is likely to be 50 BCM.

Growing demand

India is dependent on imports of crude oil for over 85 percent of its requirement while the country gets around 50 percent of its natural gas from other countries. To reduce dependency on imports, the central government has been pushing for boosting domestic production.

However, the country seems to be highly dependent on imports considering rising domestic demand and companies’ production trends. According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, India's oil product demand increased sequentially by 80,000 barrels per day (bpd) in October. On a year-on-year basis, total demand was up by 197,000 bpd, or 4 percent, as strong economic fundamentals continue.

ONGC’s consolidated net profit surged 142.4 percent to Rs 16,553 crore in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, from Rs 6,830 crore in the same period last year. Revenue from operations, however, fell 12.9 percent to Rs 1.46 lakh crore in Q2, compared to Rs 1.68 lakh crore last year.

JM Financial said in a report, “ONGC’s 2QFY24 standalone EBITDA was 6.7 percent below JMFe at Rs 18,400 crore (though only marginally below consensus of Rs 18,600 crore) due to slightly lower crude sales volume, a little lower-than-expected oil & gas realisation and higher cess (at Rs 3,660 crore versus JMFe of Rs 3,390 crore).”

Oil India Ltd

Meanwhile, state-run Oil India Ltd (OIL) registered growth of almost 6 percent in crude oil production at 0.835 MMT during the quarter. Brokerage Emkay Global said in a report that the company eyes production at a CAGR of 4-5 percent for the next two to three years.

“Crude production was in line at 0.83mmt (up 6 percent YoY), while gas was 3 percent at 0.81bcm (down 2 percent YoY). NRL’s operations resumed post the shutdown; with more than 100 percent utilisation and basic GRM up to $16.0/bbl in Q2, earnings recovered to Rs 740 crore. The management cited crude production target at 3.5-3.6mmtpa for FY24, while gas could see 2-3 percent YoY growth,” said Emkay post Oil India results.

In Q2, Oil India reported a decline of 70 percent in consolidated net profit year-on-year at Rs 640 crore, as against Rs 2,116 crore in the same quarter last year.

By Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities

Nifty remained within trading range as traders chose to wait ahead of the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at the IMF today, November 9. Nonetheless, the prevailing trend appears bullish as the Nifty closed above a critical short-term moving average.

Notably, significant support from Put writers is evident at 19,400, where they have established a substantial position. On the lower side, support levels are situated at 19,400/19,300. Conversely, resistance on the higher end is positioned at 19,500, where Call writers have added significant positions.

Bank Nifty traded sideways throughout the day. Nevertheless, the prevailing trend appears to be bullish as the index closed above a critical short-term moving average.

The support is established at 43,500 on the lower end. As long as the index maintains its position above 43,500, a ""buy on dips"" strategy is considered appropriate. On the higher end, there is potential for the index to advance towards 44,200.

Here are three buy calls for short term:

ONGC: Buy | LTP: Rs 195 | Stop-Loss: Rs 187 | Target: Rs 215 | Return: 10 percent

ONGC is showing strong technical indicators for potential gains. The stock has broken a significant monthly resistance at Rs 193, maintaining its position above it. Trading above crucial moving averages and a bullish RSI (relative strength index) crossover signal increasing strength.

Traders may consider a long position within Rs 195, with a stop-loss at Rs 187 and for a target of Rs 215. This setup suggests a bullish outlook, but prudent risk management is essential in stock trading.

Titan Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,312 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,239 | Target: Rs 3,460 | Return: 4.5 percent

The stock has been displaying an upward trajectory with a V-shaped recovery on the daily timeframe. Furthermore, it has maintained its position above the critical moving average.

The RSI is showing a bullish crossover. On the higher end, there is potential for the stock to advance towards Rs 3,460, while support on the lower end is situated at Rs 3,239.

Chambal Fertilisers & Chemicals: Buy | LTP: Rs 300 | Stop-Loss: Rs 292 | Target: Rs 324 | Return: 8 percent

The stock is currently trading with a fresh swing breakout on the daily chart, accompanied by increasing trading volume. This indicates a potential for further upward movement in the stock.

Furthermore, the stock has been consistently maintaining a pattern of higher highs and higher lows for a few days, signaling a positive trend.

Based on this pattern, there is a technical expectation of reaching levels around Rs 312 to Rs 324 on the upside.

To manage risk, it's advisable to maintain a stop-loss at Rs 292 on a closing basis. For potential investors, a good entry point is at Rs 298, and consider buying on dips around Rs 296.

State run Oil & Natural Gas Corp Ltd is expected to report flat earnings growth for the September quarter compared to the year-ago period because of limited net realisation from oil and gas, according to analysts. The company will report earnings on November 10.

ONGC is likely to report net sales of Rs 38,950 crore, up 1.6 percent on-year and 15 percent on-quarter, while net profit is expected at Rs 10,740 crore, down 16.3 percent sequentially, while it was 2 percent higher last year. EBITDA likely to be at Rs 19,900 crore, up just 6 percent over the last year and 2 percent over the last quarter, according to 10 analysts polled by Moneycontrol.

The analysts estimated modest production levels in both crude oil and gas segments, with a 1.8 percent increase in crude sales volume and a slight 0.1 percent decrease in gas sales volume on-quarter.

Antique Stock Broking expects steady results for upstream companies due to capped oil and gas prices. ONGC's production is likely to be lacklustre with a decline in EBITDA expected in the current quarter as costs return to normal after being lower than usual in the previous quarter.

The government has maintained a windfall tax rate to ensure that ONGC's crude realisation stays at $74–77 a barrel. Changes in the gas policy lowered the APM gas prices from $8.57/mmBtu to $6.5/mmBtu, affecting its gas revenues. However, improved oil and gas production and reduced operating expenses are expected to lead to a modest 2 percent increase in EBITDA quarter-on-quarter, while PAT is likely to remain unchanged, the analysts said.

Ambit Capital predicts strong earnings due to favourable oil and gas prices with stable volumes. EBITDA is expected to be 8 percent higher at Rs 17,400 crore, while oil production is pegged at 5.3 MMT for the current quarter and gas production is projected to be 5.4 BCM. Gas price realisation is expected to increase to $6.8/mmBtu, and crude realisation is forecast to be around $75/bbl.

Brokerage Nomura said in its latest note that ONGC will report steady earnings primarily due to increased windfall taxes offsetting the benefits of rising crude oil prices. ""We estimate ONGC’s EBITDA to increase 2 percent sequentially to Rs 19,900 crore, led by a 3 percent higher crude oil realisations of $78.7/bbl on-quarter and steady overall oil and gas sales volumes, in-line with recent trends,"" it said.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has won a bid to acquire PTC India Ltd's wind power unit for Rs 925 crore as the state-owned firm continues to build a renewable energy portfolio to balance its fossil fuel business.

In a stock exchange filing, India's top oil and gas producer said it has over the years diversified into the petrochemicals and power business besides growing its core business of finding hydrocarbons.

ONGC said it has taken various initiatives for renewable energy power generation and already has 189 megawatt (MW) capacity, including wind and solar PV plants spread across various locations.

""With a vision to expand its business in renewable energy, the company had participated in the bidding process for acquisition of 100 per cent equity stake of PTC Energy Limited (PEL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of PTC India Limited (PTC),"" it said.

The PTC board last week approved ONGC's bid for the acquisition of a 100 per cent equity stake in PEL at an equity value of Rs 925 crore, it said.

The nod is subject to the approval of PTC shareholders.

PEL, incorporated on August 1, 2008, has a renewable energy portfolio of 288.8 MW consisting of 50 MW wind power projects in Madhya Pradesh, 50 MW wind power projects in Karnataka and 188.8 MW wind power projects in Andhra Pradesh.

The company has entered into long-term agreements with state distribution companies for an entire portfolio of 288.8 MW wind power projects.

PEL had a profit of Rs 13.88 crore on a revenue of Rs 296.77 crore during the 2022-23 fiscal year (April 2022 to March 2023).

PTC India, which is a leading power trading and financial services solutions provider, in a separate filing, said the ""date of the extraordinary general meeting and date of signing of shareholder's agreement will be intimated as and when executed"".

ONGC has previously announced an investment of about Rs 2 lakh crore to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2038. The firm will invest Rs 1 lakh crore by 2030 in setting up 10 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, a green ammonia plant, and offshore wind energy projects. The remaining would flow thereafter to achieve Scope 1 and 2 net zero carbon emissions.

All this while, it continues to hunt and produce more oil and gas.

The company currently has 189 MW of capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources. It is targeting 10 GW by 2030. The firm already has signed an MoU for 5 GW in Rajasthan and is scouting for projects of similar size. Besides, it wants to set up 25 compressed biogas plants that will convert agri-residue into gas that can be used to run automobiles (CNG) or used in industries to generate electricity and fertiliser.

ONGC is also scouting for opportunities to set up a 1 million tonnes per annum green ammonia plant.

Scope 1 emissions are from directly emitting sources that are owned or controlled by a company. Scope 2 emissions are from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, or other sources of energy generated upstream from a company's direct operations.

ONGC produced 19.584 million tonnes (MT) of oil in 2022-23, up from 19.545 MT in the previous year. The output is likely to rise to 20.232 MT in the current fiscal (April 2023 to March 2024) and to 21.265 MT in 2024-25.

Natural gas output is slated to rise from 20.636 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2022-23 to 20.882 bcm in 2023-24, 22.171 bcm in the following year and 23.708 bcm in 2025-26.",598,0.9078017671902975

India’s crude oil production has witnessed an uptick in the last couple of months after months of declining production. Even with the Indian government pushing to boost domestic production, India would be heavily dependent on crude imports, experts told Moneycontrol.

Domestic crude oil production increased 2.1 percent in August on a year-on-year (YoY) basis to 2.5 million metric tonnes (MMT), as shown by data from the oil ministry. Crude production was also up in the month of July and steady in June, compared to a decline reported in the previous months.

Experts pointed out that the recent increase in domestic production could be attributed to developments in the respective blocks of oil explorers.

“Companies such as ONGC and Vedanta are constantly developing their blocks. The uptick in production could be due to some fields having started production. Vedanta is also increasing its production, especially after it received an extension for its production sharing contract,” said Prashant Vasisht, Vice President and Co-Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA.

However, despite the increase in domestic production, the majority of India’s demand would be fulfilled by imports from other countries, according to experts.

“The government is pushing for increasing domestic production so that our import dependency goes down. Our domestic crude production currently only accounts for 10-12 percent of our requirements. And, therefore, India would be highly dependent on imports even if production increased,” said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities.

“ONGC and Oil India are working on increasing exploratory activities, and there would be some increase in production. But, overall, we would not see a major impact on imports. We do not have any major discoveries (in India), and these projects are very capex-intensive. So the impact of exploratory activities would be visible after a long time,” added Jasani.

India is dependent on imports to meet around 85 percent of its crude oil requirements. The major suppliers of crude oil to India are Middle-Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and Russia--which has emerged as the country’s largest supplier since the war broke out between Ukraine and Russia.

Demand for oil in India has been increasing in recent months. According to an exclusive poll conducted by Moneycontrol, the country’s oil demand is expected to moderately increase in 2023, with 11 out of 12 experts supporting the notion. With an increase in oil demand, India’s crude imports would rise if domestic production did not catch up.

Oil and gas explorers such as state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC), Oil India Limited (OIL), and private players in India are boosting exploration in their respective fields to arrest the decline in production.

Post the Q1FY24 result announcement, ONGC said that it is taking proactive steps by implementing well interventions and advancing new well drilling activities. The company had said that the decline in production would be compensated in the upcoming quarters with the commencement of additional production from new projects, especially crude oil production from KG 98/2 in Q3FY24.

“ONGC’s production outlook has improved because production from the KG block is expected to start soon. When that starts, it will contribute to around 4 percent of India’s output. So, this is one asset that will lead to growth in domestic output. Oil India is also growing at 5-6 percent currently,” said Sabri Hazarika, Research Analyst at Emkay.",568,0.42469562424553764

Broad-based selling, weak global cues, monthly expiry and inflation fears fanned by rising oil prices dragged the Indian market almost a percent lower on September 28.

At close, the equity benchmark Nifty was down 193 points, or 0.98 percent, at 19,523.50, with all sectoral indices in the red as volatility spiked on the monthly F&O expiry day.

Rising crude stokes inflation fears

""The selling was broad-based, as investors are on alert given the rise of oil prices. If crude continues to stay above the 90 USD level, it will be a threat to inflation and boil the operational margins” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.

Globally, the US GDP data and the Federal Reserve chief’s speech would be closely tracked for clues to future trend. Currently, the combination of higher interest rates and US bond yields is influencing FIIs to stay in the sell mode, he said.

US oil futures jumped to their highest in more than a year as a drop in crude stocks added to worries over tight global supplies. Global benchmark Brent crude futures were up 36 cents at $96.91 after rising to the highest since November earlier in the session.

Sectoral indices flash red

All NSE sectoral indices ended in the red.

The Nifty IT index was down 2.19 percent, Nifty FMCG 1.91 percent and the auto index closed 1.17 percent lower. The Nifty media index was down 1.5 percent, while PSU bank and consumer durables lost more than a percent each.

Nifty private bank, financial services, healthcare, realty, metal, oil & gas and Nifty pharma were down more than half a percent each.

These stocks bucked the trend

Of the 50 Nifty constituents, 42 ended in the red but eight defied the losing momentum.

L&T was the biggest gainer, up more than 2 percent at Rs 3,025. Bharti Airtel jumped 1.17 percent, while ONGC, Coal India and Power Grid gained around half a percent each. Axis Bank, NTPC and SBI, too, managed to close in the green.

""Both price and momentum indicators suggest that there is a further downside possible for Nifty over the next few trading sessions,” said Jatin Gedia–Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

In terms of levels, 19,500–19440 is the crucial support zone, while 19,625 – 19,650 will act as an immediate hurdle, he said. “We expect the Bank Nifty to drift towards 43,800. On the upside 44,700–44,800 shall act as an immediate hurdle zone,” Gedia added.

National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, NTPC Green Energy Limited (NGEL) and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on September 27 to explore the development of renewable energy and offshore wind power projects in alignment with the Indian government's energy transition objectives.

The collaboration is also to pursue initiatives in various areas of renewable energy in India and overseas, which include offshore wind projects, exploring opportunities in storage, e-mobility, carbon credits, green credits, green hydrogen business and its derivatives (green ammonia and green methanol), NTPC said in a statement.

The MoU was signed by Mohit Bhargava, CEO of NGEL and Deb Adhikari ED-JV and BD of ONGC in the presence of Gurdeep Singh, CMD of NTPC and Arun Kumar Singh, Chairman and CEO of ONGC.

Power generation company NTPC had established a wholly-owned subsidiary named NTPC Green Energy Limited (NGEL) as part of its strategy to expand its renewable energy portfolio.

NGEL is tasked with overseeing renewable energy parks and projects, including business in offshore wind projects, green hydrogen, energy storage technologies, carbon markets and round-the-clock RE Power.

ONGC, a key player in petroleum exploration, production and transportation, operates in the oil and gas value chain, including refining, petrochemicals and oil & gas marketing. The group is also engaged in power generation and distribution and intends to further bolster its presence in the renewable energy sector.

According to the statement, NTPC Group has outlined a plan to achieve a renewable energy capacity of 60 GW by 2032. On the other hand, ONGC has set its sights on attaining a 10 GW renewable energy capacity by 2030 and is committed to achieving a net-zero target (Scope 1 & Scope 2) by 2038.",307,0.9926735758781433

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has signed an agreement to sell crude oil it produces from Mumbai offshore fields to HPCL – the second such agreement in as many months, as India's top oil and gas producer prefers term contracts over auctions where refiners hammer deep discounts.

In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, ONGC said it has inked ""term agreement with HPCL for sale of crude oil from Mumbai offshore."" While it did not give details, sources aware of the matter said the pact for sale of about 4.5 million tonnes per annum of crude oil to Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd's (HPCL) Mumbai refinery.

""This is the second term agreement sealed for sale of Mumbai Offshore crude oil post marketing freedom,"" ONGC said.

Last month, ONGC had signed a similar pact to sell 4 million tonnes per annum plus an optional 0.5 million tonnes of crude oil to Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), which too has a refinery to convert the crude oil into fuels like petrol and diesel at Mumbai.

ONGC produces 13-14 million tonnes per annum of crude oil from its fields in the Arabian Sea, off the Mumbai coast.

In June last year, the government abolished a rule that said oil from blocks awarded prior to 1999 must be sold to government-nominated customers, mostly state refiners. The old rule had led to producers such as ONGC and Oil India not getting the best market price.

Subsequent to that rule change, ONGC started quarterly auctions of crude oil produced from Mumbai High and Panna/Mukta fields in the western offshore.

While the company got a slight premium over Brent – the crude oil its Mumbai offshore is closest in quality to – in the initial auction, refiners like Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) started seeking discounts equivalent to one they got on Russian oil, sources said.

Following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February last year, Russian oil was sanctioned and shunned by European buyers and some in Asia, such as Japan. This led to Russian Urals crude being traded at a discount to Brent crude (the global benchmark). The discount on Russian Urals grade was as high as USD 30 a barrel in the middle of last year and now around USD 16.

Sources said refiners like IOC argued that they needed discounts as they suffered losses on selling petrol and diesel at below cost to keep inflation in check.

ONGC resisted the discounts arguing that the government has taken away all upsides of the recent surge in oil prices through a levy of windfall profit tax.

And as a way out, it floated the idea of a term contract – selling a fixed quantity of oil in a year at the pre-agreed benchmark.

It first signed up BPCL for the term contract and now it has inked a pact with HPCL.

Sources said the pact with BPCL and HPCL are benchmarked to traded price of Brent.

In the first auction last year, ONGC had offered 33 lots of 412,500 barrels each – 26 cargoes from Uran near Mumbai and seven cargoes from Mumbai offshore – for sale starting November 1, 2022 at a minimum USD 0.5 premium over the average monthly price of Brent.

All the cargoes were sold to state refiners except one, which was awarded to Reliance Industries Ltd, sources said adding the refiners bid to pay a premium of USD 1.80-1.85 per barrel for cargoes from Uran, where supplies come through a pipeline, USD 3.8-6.5 per barrel for offshore cargoes and about USD 1.55 per barrel for a parcel from Panna-Mukta field.

Uran cargoes fetch a lower premium as local taxes make the crude costlier than offshore supplies.

Stocks of state-run oil producers ONGC and Oil India were largely unfazed by the hike in windfall tax. While ONGC traded little changed, Oil India edged up marginally on September 18.

At 10:50am, Oil India was trading at Rs 288.60, up 1.4 percent from Friday's close, while ONGC was trading at Rs 186.65, on a par with Friday's close.

On September 15, the government announced a hike in the windfall tax on domestic production of crude oil to Rs 10,000 per tonne from Rs 6,700 per tonne. The increase became effective on September 16. In its previous review, the government had reduced the so-called Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED) on crude petroleum to Rs 6,700 per tonne from Rs 7,100 per tonne.

Windfall tax is a cess levied on products during periods of 'unexpected excessive profits'. This latest levy on domestic crude oil has come on the back of a sudden rise on global crude oil prices to $90 per barrel. However, SAED on diesel export will fall to Rs 5.50 per litre from Rs 6 per litre currently.

Additionally, the government has cut the windfall tax on aviation turbine fuel (ATF) to Rs 3.50 a litre from Rs 4.

Addressing an oil-spill, which occured near Uran in Mumbai on September 8, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on September 10 said 'no damage' was caused to either farmers or fishermen. ""In the morning hours of September 8, 2023, a minor quantity of oil leaked from one of the crude oil storage tanks at ONGC Uran Plant, due to heavy rains, the leaked oil entered the stormwater drain channel,"" ONGC said. As soon as the oil spill was reported, ONGC's Oil Spill Response (OSR) team was deployed to avoid the ingress of oil into the sea and cleaning of the shoreline commenced on a war footing. ONGC mentioned that the operation was made more difficult by the rocky terrain of the beach.

The ONGC added that locals residing near the area had taken an unauthorised water connection to their fields by breaching the stormwater drain channel wall from the plant for irrigation purposes, however they added that only a small quantity of oil entered the fields, leaving the crop mostly unharmed.

Talking about the restorative work done after the spill, the public sector undertaking mentioned that prompt work has led to an early restoration of the affected areas.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will infuse about Rs 15,000 crore in OPaL as part of a financial restructuring exercise that will see gas utility GAIL being edged out of the petrochemical firm. ONGC currently holds a 49.36 per cent stake in ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPaL), which operates a mega petrochemical plant at Dahej in Gujarat. GAIL (India) Ltd has 49.21 per cent interest and Gujarat State Petrochemical Corp (GSPC) has the remaining 1.43 per cent.

The ONGC board last week approved a financial restructuring of the petchem firm which had been making losses due to its high debt. ONGC will convert share warrants into equity, buy back debentures and invest Rs 7,000 crore more equity, which will give it about 95 per cent stake, the company said in a stock exchange filing. The proposal approved includes ""conversion of share warrants issued by OPaL and subscribed by ONGC into equity shares upon payment of final call money of Rs 86.281 crore at the rate of Rs 0.25 per warrant,"" it said.

Also, ONGC will ""buy back compulsory convertible debentures (CCDs) of Rs 7,778 crore."" CCDs issued by OPaL with backstopping support of ONGC are presently held by financial institutions. ONGC will also invest Rs 7,000 crore in equity/quasi-equity security of OPaL, it said. Upon implementation, OPaL would become a subsidiary of ONGC, it added. The financial restructuring ""will augment the holding of ONGC in OPaL and OPaL will become more profitable,"" it said, adding that the total cost of acquisition would be Rs 14,864.281 crore.

OPaL was incorporated on November 15, 2006, as a mega, grassroots petrochemical complex to use naphtha produced by ONGC at Hazira as well as rich gas being imported at Dahej. It is an anchor tenant of Dahej PCPIR, Gujarat and has exported its products to more than 50 countries. OPaL mega petrochemical complex has the capacity to produce 1.5 million tonne per annum of polymers (1,100 kilo tonne per annum (KTPA) ethylene, 400 KTPA propylene), 0.5 million tonne of chemicals, and several other products through the associated units of pyrolysis gasoline hydrogenation unit, butadiene extraction unit and benzene extraction unit.

GAIL had in 2008 picked up a stake in OPaL, which was then building the mega petrochemical complex at Dahej. But the project faced major cost and time overruns and GAIL decided to restrict its equity contribution to the original Rs 996.28 crore. The plant, which at the time of conception was projected to cost Rs 12,440 crore, was completed only in 2017 at a cost of about Rs 30,000 crore. GAIL and GSPC will now together hold close to 5 per cent in OPaL post-financial restructuring.

ONGC had invested about Rs 4,400 crore as equity and warrants in OPaL. As a Maharatna PSU, it is permitted to invest only up to Rs 5,000 crore in a joint venture. OPaL’s accumulated losses touched Rs 13,000.3 crore on March 31, 2023.",500,-0.5287309885025024

""We maintain ONGC's Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) at 'bbb+', which reflects ONGC's scale as the largest oil and gas (O&G) producer in India, its significant reserves and production, and its vertically integrated and geographically diversified business model, which are comparable with that of peers rated in the 'A' category by Fitch,"" it said in a statement on August 31.

Key drivers

State Support: The rating agency believes that ONGC's status, ownership and control by the government is 'strong' due to the state's majority ownership and board appointments. ""We expect the state to extend support to ONGC, if needed, due to its importance in India's energy security as the largest national upstream company and third-largest refiner and marketer of petroleum products.""

Capex plans: Fitch expects ONGC's consolidated capex to rise to rs 60,300 crore by FY27 from Rs 49,000 crore in FY23 as its core capex remains high and green energy investments increase.

Large production and reserves: ONGC is one of the largest global oil exploration and production companies. It produced 1.06mmboepd (Million Barrels of Oil Equivalent Per Day) of O&G in FY23, had proved reserves of around 5.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent (4.0 billion boe in India) and reserve life of around 15 years at FYE23. This, Fitch said, compares with 'A' rated peers such as China National Offshore Oil Corporation's (CNOOC ) production of 1.7 mmboepd.

ONGC expects peak crude oil production of 45,000 barrels per day from KG basin (bpd) in the Bay of Bengal by the financial year 2024-25.

The company said on August 29 post AGM that oil production of 10,000 bpd would commence from the basin by October 2023.

ONGC, the country’s largest explorer, was initially expected to begin gas production from the Cluster-II fields of the KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 project in June 2019, while oil production was anticipated to begin in March 2020.

Motilal Oswal's research report on ONGC

ONGC’s reported EBITDA stood at INR194.5b (-25% YoY, +19% QoQ), 8% above our estimate, due to slightly higher gas realization and lower profit petroleum. As per earlier guidance, management expects oil production from KG-DWN98/2 to commence by Aug’23 in an optimistic scenario and by Oct’23 in a worst-case scenario. The peak oil production is likely to be ~40-45kbopd. Although the levy of windfall tax by the Center with a fortnightly revision raised concerns on realizations of upstream companies, the government has adjusted windfall taxes in line with crude oil fluctuations. Our estimate suggests that the government is allowing a post-windfall realization of USD68-81/bbl and we expect it to remain at ~USD70/bbl from 2QFY24 onwards. The implementation of the Kirit Parikh Committee's recommendations from Apr'23 has provided the much-needed respite to the company, as it had to sell gas below the cost of production for quite a long time. We build in gas price assumptions of USD6.7/mmBtu for FY24-FY25E. Additionally, ~6-8% of APM gas production comes from new wells that will attract 20% premium as per the new pricing policy.



Outlook

We value the standalone business at 6x FY25E adj. EPS of INR30.8 and add the value of investments to arrive at our TP of INR220, implying 24% potential upside. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock.

India's exploration off the coast of Vietnam has not gone down well with China, which has a running dispute with several countries in the region over its South China Sea claims. Block 128, also called as ""nine dash line"" is a vital route as goods worth $5 trillion are traded annually. China claims the entire sea route, which is also claimed by the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is investing Rs 1 lakh crore by the end of this decade in low-carbon energy opportunities, including renewables and green hydrogen as it looks to transform into a low-carbon energy player, the company said.

In a statement, India's largest crude oil and natural gas producer said it has detailed a ""roadmap to scale up its low-carbon energy portfolio significantly"".

""ONGC has aligned itself with India's ambitious goals and is wholeheartedly contributing to the nation's aim to curtail carbon emissions by 1 billion tonne and simultaneously reduce carbon intensity by 45 per cent by 2030,"" it said.

It said the firm has adopted various de-carbonization levers resulting in significant emission reductions over years.

""Integrating sustainable practices into core operations has enabled a reduction in Scope-1 and Scope-2 emissions by 17 per cent in the last five years. ONGC has reduced its emissions by 2.66 per cent in FY23 (April 2022 to March 2023 fiscal year).

""ONGC plans to significantly increase its spending on green initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint as a broader effort to achieve net-zero for Scope-1 and Scope-2 emissions by 2038,"" the statement said.

The firm is in an advanced stage of crafting collaborations with leading players in the energy space on various low-carbon energy opportunities including renewables, green hydrogen, green ammonia and other derivatives of green hydrogen.

""ONGC is planning to set up two green-field O2C plants in India,"" the statement said without giving details.

It is also ""charting a roadmap for opportunities in renewable energy and low-carbon sectors. ONGC is investing around Rs 1 lakh crore by the end of this decade, on its multiple green initiatives and is planning to scale up its renewable portfolio to 10 GW by 2030."" ONGC is also actively exploring collaborations with leading players to leverage various low-carbon energy opportunities including renewables, green hydrogen, green ammonia and other derivatives of green hydrogen.

Also, the focus is on research and development in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies to mitigate emissions from existing processes.

""However, oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) will remain the cornerstone of its energy business. Extensive exploration in known basins as well as frontier plays, sustained production from existing fields and exploitation of deep-water fields remain the central areas of emphasis,"" the statement said.

In recent years, ONGC has persistently pushed the frontiers of exploration, expanding its boundaries.

Under its 'Future Exploration Strategy', ONGC has set up an ambitious target to bring 5 lakh square kilometers area under active exploration by acquiring one lakh square km every year, spending Rs 10,000 crore annually on exploration by 2025.

""ONGC is dynamically evolving to meet changing realities. While maintaining our immediate focus on exploration and production, we are also crafting a future-ready ONGC that exemplifies resilience, agility, and adaptability. With each step forward, its discourse and actions will align more with that of an 'energy' company rather than solely an oil and gas explorer and producer,"" the statement added.",511,0.9103481684412275

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) reported on August 11 an increase of 102 percent in consolidated net profit for the first quarter of the financial year 2023-24.

Net profit of the state-owned oil and gas explorer came in at Rs 17,383 crore in Q1, compared to Rs 8,581 crore in the year-ago period.

However, the company’s standalone net profit tanked 34 percent to Rs 10,015 crore in the quarter, from Rs 15,206 crore in last year.

Revenue from operations declined 10 percent to Rs 1.63 lakh crore in the June quarter, as against Rs 1.82 lakh crore in the same period last year, ONGC said in an exchange filing.

Crude oil output of the company declined 3.3 percent to 5.311 million metric tonnes (MMT) from 5.495 MMT in year-ago period. Similarly, gas output was 3 percent lower in the quarter compared to last year.

The company said output in the quarter declined on account of shutdown in Panna-Mukta offshore platforms and cyclone Biparjoy.

“The reduction in ONGC's production output in Q1 FY 2023-24 was due to: a. Shutdown in Panna-Mukta offshore platforms for commissioning of new crude oil pipeline to modernise its evacuation facilities, post taking over from JV Partners. b. Cyclone Biparjoy (June 2023) disrupted offshore and onshore production. c. Crude oil wells in southern India had to be stopped as a refinery there stopped receiving oil, following a leakage in their pipeline,” the company said in a press release.

ONGC said current output decline was temporary and it would be compensated in the upcoming quarters.

To counter the decline in production from some of the matured and marginal fields, the company is taking proactive steps by implementing well interventions and advancing new well drilling activities, said ONGC post-results.

“The current decline in production is temporary. The same will be compensated in upcoming quarters with commencement of additional production from new projects; especially by crude oil production commencement from KG 98/2 in Q3 2023-24,” the company said.

In the first quarter of FY24, ONGC declared total four discoveries (1 in onland and 3 in offshore) in its operated acreages. Out of these, 3 are prospect (offshore) and 1 pool discovery (onland).

One discovery—Gopavaram-21—has already been monetized, said ONGC.",411,-0.5116429660055373

Domestic natural gas price will continue to remain at $6.5 per mmBtu (million metric British thermal unit) in July 2023, according to a notification by the Oil Ministry.

Domestic gas prices were at $6.5 per mmBtu in June as well.

The domestic gas price notified by the government applies to the natural gas produced from the legacy and oil fields of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Limited (OIL).

For July, domestic natural gas price stood at $7.48 per mmBtu, as per the formula used for calculation of gas prices. However, according to the new gas pricing mechanism, domestic gas prices are now subject to a floor and ceiling of $4 per mmBtu and $6.5 per mmBtu, respectively.

In the new regime, domestic gas pricing is linked with the imported crude pricing and would be at 10 percent of the Indian crude basket. Gas prices are revised on a monthly basis.

This comes after a government-appointed panel led by energy expert and former Planning Commission (since renamed NITI Aayog) member Kirit Parikh recommended several changes in gas pricing to immune domestic players and consumers from the volatility in global markets.

Indian oil producers are expected to benefit from the slashing of the windfall tax on crude oil to nil for over a month now, according to analysts.

The government last revised the windfall tax on May 15, when the special additional excise duty (SAED) on domestically produced crude oil was reduced to zero from Rs 4,100 per tonne. The windfall tax on petrol, diesel, and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) was left unchanged at zero.

Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities, said, ""Prior to May 15, they (oil producers) were paying tax at a particular range on their production. Now they are not paying that; so that is their benefit.""

This comes as the Indian crude basket averaged $74.98 per barrel during May 2023, against $83.76 per barrel during April 2023 and $109.51 per barrel during May 2022, according to official data. Crude oil prices are hovering around $75 per barrel in June as well.

""Windfall tax was structured in a way that net realisation is around $75. If we look at this quarter, the average would be around $75, and therefore, there was no windfall tax in June. If you look at realisation in the second and third quarters, the net realisation of windfall tax would also be around this figure,"" said Nitin Tiwari, Executive Vice President, Yes Securities.

Windfall tax has weighed on the performance of state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Limited (OIL). Several oil companies had urged the government to remove the windfall tax.

In the quarter ending March 31, ONGC reported a decline of 53 percent in its consolidated net profit on a year-on-year (YoY) basis.

A top oil ministry official said on June 7 that the windfall tax is expected to remain zero if oil prices remain in the current range.

The windfall tax, which was first imposed in July 2022, is revised every fortnight based on the movements of international crude and product prices.

A windfall tax is levied by governments when an industry unexpectedly earns large profits — primarily due to an unprecedented event. Crude prices had touched an all-time high of $140 per barrel in March 2022 amid geopolitical tensions.",384,-0.3215428392092387

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) says there is no impact of Cyclone Biparjoy as the oil giant moved 36 rigs in the western offshore, much ahead of the cyclone.

ONGC shifted 36 rigs in what it calls the pre-monsoon rig move period – from the last week of March till end of May 2023 -- in the western offshore, the company told Moneycontrol on June 22.

No more rig moves are planned till the end of the monsoon season this year as all rigs have been deployed at their monsoon locations.

This move was carried out on the western coast, which was hit by Cyclone Bipayjoy in Gujarat, in mid-June. The state-owned oil PSU said that after Cyclone Tauktae in 2021, it has updated its cyclone ERP (Emergency Response Plan) to ensure the safety of its rigs.

Emergency Response Plan

“After Cyclone Tauktae, ONGC has updated the cyclone ERP to make the action points simple, clear, unambiguous and actionable to ensure the safety of our personnel, assets, operations and environment,” the company said.

In 2021, 86 ONGC workers had lost their lives when Barge P-305, an ONGC vessel, sank after the western offshore was hit by Cyclone Tauktae. Several high-level ONGC officials had come under the scanner after an inquiry into the incident.

At the time of the cyclone in 2021, the oil giant did not have a chairman and managing director. The company did not have a full-time head since March 2021. However, Arun Kumar Singh was appointed as chairman in December 2022. He was later declared as CEO of the company.

ONGC said it also monitors cyclone forecasts from various sources, including IMD (India Meteorological Department), StormGeo and Windy.com.

“ONGC has formulated a robust cyclone ERP for Offshore Drilling rigs through a team of in-house domain experts, having vast experience in offshore Drilling, Maintenance, Safety & Marine Operations,” the company

said.

In case of an imminent cyclone, ONGC activates an in-house cyclone control room to monitor it, disseminate information, issue advisories to rigs and coordinate with all officials.

All rigs covered under insurance

ONGC said that all the rigs owned by the company are covered under insurance.

“All ONGC-owned rigs are covered under ONGC’s Energy Insurance Package Policy with United India Insurance Company Limited, which addresses cyclones as well. Charter-hired rigs have their own insurance coverage,” the company said.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) expects India’s ninth round of oil block auctions to start in July and is approaching foreign companies for potential partnership in joint exploration.

The government has announced the offer of 26 blocks in the 9th Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) round, but bidding has not opened yet. The blocks cover an area of over 223,000 square km. Fifteen blocks are in ultra deep water, eight blocks are in shallow water and three are on land.

State-run ONGC has started talks with foreign companies for joint exploration of these blocks.

“Contracts and MoUs are in place, but we have also written to them (foreign companies) and told them that the OALP 9th round is going to most probably be opened up in July. It has been about a week that we have spoken to them. We are waiting for the reply,” said Sushma Rawat, director (exploration), ONGC.

Rawat said ONGC is looking forward to forming partnerships with foreign companies for bidding in the Andaman-Nicobar basin, where four blocks are on offer, but will also bid alone.

“If the MNCs come, that is absolutely welcome. That is the boost regarding the potential of the basin. Otherwise, we ourselves know that some areas really hold promise. So, ONGC would be going for bidding alone also in some of the areas,” said Rawat.

ONGC is looking at partnership with foreign players such as TotalEnergies, Chevron and ExxonMobil for high-end technologies.

Meanwhile, the deadline for submission of bids for the 8th OALP round, which was launched on July 7, 2022, was deferred to July 5.

The OALP mechanism was launched under the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy and allows investors to carve out blocks of their choice by assessing exploration and production (E&P) data.

East coast exploration

ONGC closed FY23 with production dropping 0.6 percent. Its output has declined gradually over a decade as its fields are old and aging. The company expects to reverse the trend, boosted by the KG-DWN 98/2 block in the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin in the Bay of Bengal. ONGC said production may grow 11.6 percent in FY24.

Rawat said ONGC sees huge potential off the east coast of India and will go “really strong” in the area.

“We already have acreages and prior commitments and we would be coming up with the drilling phase in the Mahanadi as well as in the Kaveri offshore water,” said Rawat.

There are four major basins off the east coast – Cauvery, Krishna-Godavari, Mahanadi and Palar. In the upcoming round, four blocks are in the Mahanadi basin and three in the Cauvery basin.

Oil India, another state-owned producer of oil and gas, is also keen to bid in this area as it needs exploration attention, director (exploration and development) Manas Kumar Sharma told Moneycontrol.

New territories

Indian oil and gas companies are looking forward to tie-ups with foreign companies majors for exploration in the Andaman-Nicobar basin. The government opened up acreages in Andaman – once considered a no-go area – with the objective of increasing domestic oil and gas production.

India imports over 85 percent of its crude oil consumption and about 50 percent of its natural gas requirements.

Rawat told Moneycontrol that 2D data collection for the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons-backed survey of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) was completed last week and it will be processed soon.

The survey acquired over 22,000 line kilometres (LKM) of 2D data in the region. ONGC has already completed the survey of the two blocks it has in the Andamans from the sixth round of OALP.",598,0.9071746468544006

India’s top oil and natural gas producer ONGC has signed a pact with the nation’s largest oil refining and fuel marketing company Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) for exploring opportunities in the petrochemicals business.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and IOC ”signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to explore downstream opportunities, especially in petrochemicals, both greenfield projects and through acquisitions,” ONGC said in a tweet.

ONGC, which produces two-thirds of the nation’s oil that is refined into fuels like petrol and diesel and more than half of gas that is used to make fertilisers and turned into CNG, already has two downstream petrochemical plants through subsidiaries.

As nations transition away from polluting fossil fuels to low-carbon sources of energy like hydrogen and use of electricity to power automobiles, oil companies the world over are reinventing themselves.

Crude oil, which is currently refined in refineries to produce petrol and diesel, is to be directly converted into petrochemicals that form building blocks for a range of plastics, paints, detergents and tires. The demand for petrochemicals in India is projected to grow exponentially as the per capita consumption was much lower world average.

Last month, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri stated at a conference that the chemical market in India is projected to grow to USD 300 billion this decade from USD 178 billion.

India is expected to account for more than 10 per cent of the world’s growth in petrochemicals, a press statement issued by the Press Information Bureau (PIB) on May 19 quoted him as saying. IOC already has petrochemical units at most of its refineries and has big ambitions to grow the business.

The MoU was signed by ONGC executive director for new ventures Deb Adhikari and IOC executive director for petrochemicals Arvindar Singh Sahney, according to the picture tweeted by ONGC of the signing ceremony. IOC retweeted the same.

ONGC’s subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MPRL) operates a petrochemical unit in Karnataka. Its other subsidiary has a unit in Gujarat. The firm reportedly is looking at investing Rs 1 lakh crore by 2030 to expand the petrochemicals manufacturing capacity. This is a part of the government’s larger plan to make India a major global petrochemical hub.

ONGC’s joint venture ONGC Petro additions Ltd (OPaL) and its subsidiary MRPL is to implement expansion plans that will double the production capacity to 8 million tonnes per annum by 2030. It is not known if the MoU signed now will lead to IOC joining those projects or if the agreement is for exploring new projects altogether.",426,0.9993630051612854

India completed the data collection for the exhaustive survey of the Andaman offshore area last week and is moving closer to beginning exploration activities in the region after the government opened up the once ""no-go"" areas for exploration, officials in the know told Moneycontrol.

The survey of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), backed by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), has acquired over 22,000 line kilometres (LKM) of two-dimensional (2D) data in the region.

The government of India has taken several measures to support exploration in the Andamans, such as opening up acreages and encouraging foreign players to invest in the area, Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, told Moneycontrol on the sidelines of an event recently.

""We had to make changes. Most of our sedimentary basins were not open for exploration because somewhere Coast Guard had a problem, somewhere DRDO had a problem. We have opened up that space now,"" said Puri.

The government plans to fund the drilling of a few exploratory wells in the region. Separately, two state run-companies, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), have completed surveys and initiated exploratory activities for their blocks in the region.

Sushma Rawat, Director (Exploration), ONGC, told Moneycontrol that the 2D data collection for the DGH-backed survey of the EEZ was completed last week and the data will be processed soon.

""This is the first time it is being called island exploration; there have been phases of it over the years. Andaman is seeing a renewal of exploration activities, which is good,"" said Rawat.

The DGH had earlier said that the new data along with the legacy data will be made available through the National Data Repository, which is being upgraded to cloud-based virtual data rooms so that investors can access it.

What’s at stake?

According to the DGH, Andamans is a ‘Category II’ basin, which implies that the basin has sub-commercial discovery in place. The basin has an area of 225,918 square kilometres with 18,074 sq km shallow water area and 207,844 sq km deepwater area.

""The Andaman basin has a total hydrocarbon in place of 72 MMTOE (metric million tonnes of oil equivalent), out of which 2 MMTOE have been discovered and this is now entirely sub-commercial in place. The remaining 70 MMTOE, nearly 97 percent of the total in place is the potential to be explored and discovered,"" DGH said in its India Hydrocarbon Outlook 2022-23.

In terms of awarded acreage that is now active in the Andamans basin, 23,245 sq km are under the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP). DGH said in the report that in the upcoming Offshore Mega Open Acreage Licensing (OALP) Round IX, there is an opportunity for 53,099 sq km prospective areas in back-arc regions that are carved into four blocks, all located in ultra deepwater.

ONGC in Andaman

ONGC has completed the survey for the two blocks it has in the Andamans from the sixth round of OALP.

""We are in the process of finalising the location for the minimum work programme. We will be taking up drilling one well in each block,"" Rawat said.

Rawat said that ONGC is keen to look at more blocks in the Andamans when they come up for bidding.

""We are waiting for the ninth round to come up. DGH has earmarked the offshore blocks. As of now, ONGC has two blocks in the Andamans offshore deepwater from the OALP sixth round,"" she said.

OIL in Andaman

The basins in Andaman are expected to be sitting on large reserves of hydrocarbons. India is pushing for oil and gas exploration activities in the Andaman basin as the government focuses on domestic production for energy security.

Similarly, OIL said it submitted the survey involving the acquisition, processing, and interpretation of 22,500 LKM of 2D broadband seismic data in the Andaman-Nicobar basin to DGH on March 31, 2023.

Manas Kumar Sharma, Director (Exploration and Development), OIL, told Moneycontrol that talks are ongoing with foreign companies for exploration activities in the Andamans.

He said OIL has not yet started drilling in the Andamans and the company is mobilising the services for commencement of drilling. OIL has identified three potential drilling locations in the Andaman-Nicobar basin blocks, the company said.

""The final decision regarding bidding on these blocks has not yet been taken. We are evaluating the prospectivity of the offered blocks, and necessary due diligence is ongoing,"" Sharma commented with regard to OALP Round IX.

Who else is interested?

The basins in the Andamans are expected to contain large reserves of hydrocarbons. India is pushing for oil and gas exploration activities in the Andaman basin as the government focuses on domestic production for energy security, and this has attracted the attention of international players as well.

While foreign players such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, and TotalEnergies are understood to be keen on exploration in this area and have initiated talks with state-run companies for potential partnerships, the companies await clearances from the government. Queries sent to these companies remained unanswered.

Exploration activities in the Andamans have been long delayed, awaiting clearances from DRDO, space agencies, the Coast Guard, and other agencies.

Minister Puri said, ""You need to make data available, and you need a change in the mindset. Earlier, people would not come for exploration. Now, we are incentivising exploration. You don't even need to spend your own money. If you have the expertise, we are willing to incentivise it.""

Puri said global oil giants that are in exploration have tied up with Indian entities, and all of them are at different stages. At some places, resources have been allocated, and they are at fairly advanced stages, he added.",978,-0.01997976005077362

""This ONGC-funded Yatri Niwas will solve this logistical challenge to a large extent, by providing accommodation for 30,000 tourists in a year, thus staggering the movement of tourists and pilgrims,"" the firm said in a statement.

Every year, lakhs of tourists visit Srinagar and Amarnath. The large footfalls have been causing logistical challenges for a long time, especially for needy tourists and pilgrims.

""The ONGC Disaster Management Centre will play a pivotal role in providing essential amenities such as lodging, sanitation, and safe drinking water. It will serve as a central hub for distributing vital information and delivering relief measures during emergencies,"" it said.

Shares of Oil India Ltd and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) traded marginally higher on June 5 on the back of firm crude prices after Saudi Arabia announced another round of crude oil production cut starting July.

The OPEC nation will cut crude oil supply by 1 million barrels per day.

Brent crude was up by 1.23 percent at $77.07 and West Texas Oil climbed 1.23 percent at $72.61 after the announcement.

Oil India was quoting Rs 255, up 2 percent on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in the morning trade. ONGC was at Rs 155, up 0.26 percent on NSE.

Oil producers like Oil India and ONGC benefit from higher crude prices as it translates into higher revenues for them. Every $1-a-barrel rise in crude realisation implies a 2-4 percent increase in earnings per share for these two companies, according to analysts’ calculations.

Saudi Arabia had reduced crude production by 500,000 barrels per day in April too. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members including Iraq, UAE, Kuwait and Oman had trimmed crude oil production by a total of 1.16 million barrels per day in April. This was done to increase crude oil prices after the commodity reached lows in March in fears of the US banking crisis, the OPEC said.

State-owned ONGC's operating cash flows will rise over the next 12-24 months due to higher production volumes, stable earnings from domestic gas production, and the removal of a windfall tax on crude oil, S&P Global Ratings said on Friday.

""This should help the company maintain its good credit quality, despite its investment plans and healthy shareholder distributions,"" the rating agency said in a statement.

ONGC is India's largest oil and gas producer. ""We estimate that ONGC's domestic production volumes will rise by 8-10 percent for fiscal 2024 (year ending March 31). The increase is attributable to the start of oil production from its block in the Krishna Godavari basin later this year,"" S&P said.

At the same time, production at the Sakhalin-1 project of ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) should also recover to fiscal 2022 levels, after a period of disruptions because of geopolitical issues. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation produced a total of 42.8 million tonne of oil equivalent (mmtoe) in fiscal 2023 compared with 43.4 mmtoe in fiscal 2022. OVL produced a total of 10.2 mmtoe in fiscal 2023, down from 12.3 mmtoe in fiscal 2022.

""Growth in production volumes will outstrip the impact of moderating oil prices on ONGC's earnings, in our view. We estimate the company's EBITDA at Rs 1-1.1 lakh crore over fiscals 2024 and 2025, compared with about Rs 98,700 crore in fiscal 2023,"" it said.

S&P Global Ratings forecasts that the Brent crude oil price will be USD 90 per barrel for the rest of 2023 and $85 per barrel for 2024 and 2025. S&P Global Ratings forecasts that the Brent crude oil price will be $90 per barrel for the rest of 2023 and $85 per barrel for 2024 and 2025.

""In our view, the average realization on domestic gas production will be $6.5 per metric million British thermal unit (mmbtu) in fiscal 2024, compared with $7.5 per mmbtu in fiscal 2023. The realization rate is in line with India's new gas price formula, calculated at 10 percent of the average price of the crude basket in the preceding month, but capped at $6.5 per mmbtu,"" it said.

S&P said ONGC is expected to continue to direct 55-60 percent of its operating cash flows for capital investments over the next 12-24 months. In fiscal 2024, the company will spend about Rs 32,000 crore at the standalone level and about Rs 14,000 crore at its subsidiary, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd.

""We estimate ONGC will invest about Rs 47,500 crore in total over the year. Investments on exploration and production in existing onshore and offshore fields are critical for ONGC because production volumes have declined consistently since fiscal 2020,"" it said. Under its projections, ONGC has a sufficient cushion to undertake additional investments and maintain healthy shareholder distributions. The company is likely to step up its investments in renewables and diversify its petrochemicals business starting fiscal 2025. It plans to spend about Rs 1 lakh crore to achieve its 10-gigawatt green energy goal by 2030.

Currently, the company has renewable energy capacity of 340 megawatts, and it has committed to net-zero for scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2038. The company paid out about Rs 17,600 crore in dividends in fiscal 2023, higher than Rs 12,900 crore in fiscal 2022.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is struggling with challenges arising from oil price fluctuations and risks associated with windfall taxes, potentially putting it at the cusp of what one securities firm calls a “no-win zone.”

At a time when most analysts have a buy call on the state-run explorer’s stock, concerns are mounting about the ONGC’s limited upside potential coupled with downside vulnerability.

ONGC’s profitability is directly linked to oil prices. Yet, above the critical threshold of around $75 per barrel, any gain from rising oil prices is significantly offset by an equivalent increase in windfall tax obligations.

“We feel ONGC is entering a no-win zone,” said Nuvama Institutional Equities, which sees a downside of around 10 percent in the stock from current market price of Rs. 157.95.

While above the oil price threshold of about $75 per barrel, its upside is offset by the resultant windfall tax, its downside is unlimited below $75, explained the securities firm.

Profit drag

ONGC shall be deprived of any incremental benefit arising on high crude prices with the levy of windfall tax, which will drag down near-term profits, Nuvama warned.

Two weeks ago, the government cut windfall profit tax on domestically produced crude oil to zero from Rs 4,100 per tonne in line with softening international oil prices. The nil tax came into effect on May 16.

Besides, the Kirit Parikh committee on fair pricing of natural gas has recommended imposition of a dynamic ceiling and a fixed floor on gas prices under the Administered Price Mechanism (APM). It suggested $6.5 per MMBtu to be set as the first ceiling price, which shall increase by $0.5 every year until January 2027, and thereafter be fully deregulated. The panel also recommended a fixed floor price of $4 per MMBtu. It suggested a 10 percent slope on previous months’ average import price of Indian crude basket. The actual price shall fluctuate between floor and ceiling prices.

In short, APM gas prices are now pegged at a 10 percent slope to Brent with a ceiling and floor price of $6.5 and $4 per MMBtu.

The implementation of the Parikh committee's recommendations from April 2023 has provided a much-needed respite to ONGC because it had to sell gas below the cost of production in the past.

Stock ratings

Even so, this, according to Nuvama Institutional Equities, caps any potential super-normal profits arising amid higher crude prices (>$65 per barrel). The securities firm said that a $2 per MMBtu cut in APM prices shall have a 20 percent impact on ONGC’s FY24 earnings.

Nuvama Institutional Equities has downgraded its rating on the stock to ‘reduce’ from ‘hold’ on a weak outlook and slashed its Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation estimate for FY24 and FY25 by 7 percent while trimming its target price on the oil and gas company’s stock by 10 percent to Rs 143.

ICICI Securities said stronger long-term price assumptions and cash flows can drive a material uptick in the share price of ONGC, which prompted it to set a target price of Rs 218 with a ‘buy’ recommendation on the stock.

Read more | ONGC Videsh has less than $100 million stuck in Russia, says official

Even JM Financial Institutional Securities has retained its ‘buy’ call on ONGC shares owing to the strong dividend play of 6-8 percent. The rating stance is also because the current market price is discounting only about $55-60 per barrel of net crude realisation while its target price is based on FY25 net crude realisation of $65 per barrel. Yet, the securities firm has cut its target price to Rs 200 from Rs 220.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services has also retained its ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 215.

Provisions hit profit

On a standalone basis, ONGC reported a net loss of Rs 248 crore for the quarter ended March 2023, compared to a Rs 8,860 crore net profit recorded a year ago. Gross revenue increased by 5.2 percent to Rs 36,293 crore from Rs 34,497 crore a year-ago.

The company said that its profit was hit by a provision of Rs 12,107 crore made in the quarter to cover possible liabilities arising from ongoing royalty tax proceedings with tax authorities. The company said the provision includes service tax and Goods and Services Tax on royalty and interest on it in the period between April 1, 2016 and March 31, 2023. This has been done as a prudent practice, the company added.

ONGC dominates India’s oil and gas production with a more than two-third share of the country’s production of oil and oil equivalent gas. It contributes around 78 percent and 73 percent to total oil and gas production, respectively.

State run-Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd aims to invest Rs 1 lakh crore to scale up its renewable energy capacity to 10 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 from 189 megawatts at the end of 2022-23, Chairman Arun Kumar Singh told reporters.

Global oil giants, including Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP and Total, are pivoting to low-carbon businesses as pressure mounts on them to respond to the climate crisis. ONGC plans to align itself with India’s ambitious target to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to net zero by 2070.

“The country’s energy demand will keep going up. It's not that fossil fuel demand in India will go down; for others, it may go down by 2030 but India will still see growing fossil fuel demand till 2040,” Singh said.

“But we have to step up our effort for green energy so that at least 2070 we are net zero,” he said.

Singh said that ONGC wants to focus on round-the-clock renewable energy projects and the company’s research centre is working on such solutions.

“Battery storage would depend on how viable it is. Non-battery solutions are also an option; it is capital intensive which is something ONGC is very good at,” Singh said, explaining that the company is ready to commit capital to large-scale RTC projects.

ONGC has signed a pact with the Rajasthan government to set up 5 GW of renewable energy projects and is on the lookout for opportunities to develop another 5GW. The company is exploring offshore wind energy projects and is keen to set up a 1 million tonne per annum capacity of Green Ammonia.

In its traditional business, the company plans a capital expenditure of Rs 30,125 crore in 2023-24 as against Rs 30,208 crore in the previous year, financed primarily from internal accruals.",306,0.47958239912986755

State run-Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd plans a capital expenditure of Rs 30,125 crore in 2023-24 as against a Rs 30,208 crore in the previous year, financed primarily from internal accruals.

The oil exploration company said that in the last five years, it has spent around Rs 1,44,000 crore on capital expenditure.

“One of the greatest things to have happened in the history of ONGC is that the government’s new gas pricing policy pegs the floor at $4/ mmBtu and ceiling at $6.5/mmBtu. Assuming that this price continues at $6.5 for two years and there onwards there is 25 paise increase, and assuming that crude remains above $70 (per barrel)...ONGC’s revenue stream will remain robust,"" Chairman Arun Kumar Singh told reporters.

“Cash flow wise, I don’t think ONGC will be required to go anywhere to raise funds,” he said.

The administered price mechanism (APM) gas, or gas produced by legacy fields, or nomination fields of ONGC, is now priced at 10 percent of the price of the India crude basket, but capped at $6.5/mmBtu. The floor or base price is $4/mmBtu.

Shares of ONGC declined almost 3 percent on May 29 to end at Rs 158.90 on the BSE, after the company reported a decline in its consolidated net profit, late evening on May 27. The net profit for the fourth quarter of FY23 plummeted to Rs 5,701 crore from Rs 12,061.44 crore in the corresponding period last year after the company made provision of Rs 12,107 crore towards disputed service tax and GST on royalty and interest on it in the period between April 1, 2016 and to March 31, 2023. The company’s consolidated total income in Q4FY23 increased to Rs 166,728.80 crore from Rs 158,660.49 crore in the year-ago quarter.

Output to rise

ONGC, which has witnessed a gradual decline in output for over a decade as its fields are old and aging, closed FY23 with production which was only marginally down by 0.6 percent. But the company expects the trend to reverse and the output to increase, boosted by Block KG-DWN 98/2 in the Bay of Bengal.

In 2023-24, ONGC expects production to grow 11.6 percent year-on-year.

ICICI Securities in a note post the results, said, “Given that KG basin gas would qualify for premium pricing and that international prices would likely remain well above the historical levels, we see net gas realisations at Rs21.7/scm and Rs22.8/scm for FY24E and FY25E vs Rs22.2/scm for FY23. We note that these prices compare favourably with the FY15-FY23 average blended price of Rs10.6/scm.”",435,0.6557244420051574

India's flagship overseas firm ONGC Videsh has less than USD 100 million of dividend income lying in Russia because of Ukraine conflict but the company is not in a hurry to bring it back, a senior official said on Monday.

Indian state oil firms have invested USD 5.46 billion in buying stakes in four different assets in Russia. These include a 49.9 per cent stake in the Vankorneft oil and gas field and another 29.9 per cent in the TAAS-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha fields.

They get dividends on profits made by the operating consortium from selling oil and gas produced from the fields. Soon after invading Ukraine in February last year, Russia put restrictions on repatriation of dollars to check volatility in foreign exchange rates.

OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), got its last dividend back in July 2022. One dividend payout that came after that is lying in the company's account in Russia.

Its managing director Rajarshi Gupta said the dividend income lying in Russia is ""less than USD 100 million."" ""We are not in a hurry to get it back as the company has capital and operating expenses for the three projects in Russia,"" he said. ""It is business as usual as far as dividend is concerned."" OVL holds interest in Russia through a Singapore subsidiary.

Moscow declared Singapore as an unfriendly nation last year and so money from Russia cannot flow to any company incorporated in that country.

He said the company is looking at right banking channels and discussions are on. Last week, Oil India officials said USD 300 million dividend income of the company and its partners are stuck in Russia.

The consortium of OIL, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat PetroResources Ltd has stakes in two projects.

The USD 300 million dividend was lying with the Commercial Indo Bank LLC (CIBL), which was a joint venture of State Bank of India and Canara Bank. Canara Bank in March sold its 40 per cent stake in CIBL to SBI.

The dividend from TAAS was paid on a quarterly basis, while Vankorneft's earnings were paid half-yearly. The Indian firms are looking at options of how to repatriate the money from Russia, he said.

OVL holds a 26 per cent stake in Suzunskoye, Tagulskoye and Lodochnoye fields -- collectively known as the Vankor cluster in the north-eastern part of West Siberia.

Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Bharat PetroResources Ltd (a unit of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd or BPCL) hold another 23.9 per cent in Vankor. Russia's Rosneft is the operator with 50.1 per cent interest.

The consortium of OIL, IOC and Bharat PetroResources has a 29.9 per cent stake in TAAS-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha. The operations of the fields have not been impacted and they continue to produce as normal.

OVL also has a 20 per cent stake in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field in Far East Russia, and in 2009 acquired Imperial Energy, which has fields in Siberia, for USD 2.1 billion.

OVL, which has 32 oil and gas properties in 15 countries from Venezuela to Vietnam, had seen oil production fall to 6.349 million tonne in 2022-23 fiscal (April 2022 to March 2023) from 8.099 million tonne in the previous year.

Gas output also dipped to 3.822 billion cubic meters from 4.231 bcm in 2021-22. The lower production was because of halting of operations at Sakhalin-1 for seven months after operator Exxon declared force majure post Ukraine war.

But higher oil prices help it post a net profit of Rs 1,700 crore in FY23 as against a PAT of Rs 1,589 crore in the previous fiscal.",630,-0.33302656809488934

India's top oil and gas producer ONGC has finally put a date for the much-awaited start of production from its KG basin gas field as it sought USD 12 price for the fuel it plans to deliver from June 15.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will produce 0.4 million standard cubic metres per day - a fraction of the planned output from the block that sits next to Reliance Industries' prolific KG-D6 area in the Bay of Bengal, from June 15 and will ramp it up to 1.4 mmscmd by February 5, 2024, according to tender document the firm floated, seeking bids for gas sales.

ONGC's director for production Pankaj Kumar had in March told PTI that the firm will start production of oil from KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block in the Krishna Godavari basin by May or June this year. A small amount of gas will also flow with the oil that comes out of the reservoir lying several hundred metres below the seabed.

The company has now sought bids from users like city gas operators that sell CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households, companies using gas to produce fertiliser or make electricity, LPG producers and traders, for the gas that will flow from June 15.

ONGC asked companies to quote a premium 'P' that they are willing to pay over and above the rate arrived at by calculating 14 per cent prevailing Brent oil price plus USD 1 per million British thermal unit, the document showed.

At the current Brent crude oil price of nearly USD 77 per barrel, the base price comes to USD 11.8 per mmBtu (USD 10.78 per mmBtu at 14 per cent of Brent oil price plus a markup of USD 1).

The floor price will be the lower of the price arrived at using this formula or the rate that the oil ministry's arm PPAC notifies twice a year for deepsea fields. The ceiling price for difficult-to-produce fields like deepsea for six months starting April 1 is USD 12.12 per mmBtu.

ONGC was originally to start gas production from Cluster-II fields in the KG-D5 in June 2019, and the first oil was to flow in March 2020.

The company blamed contracting and supply chain issues due to the pandemic for shifting the start of oil production first to November 2021, then to the third quarter of 2022 and now to June 2023. The gas output start target was first revised to May 2021, then to May 2023 and now to May 2024 for non-associated gas to start flowing.

Kumar had told PTI that a floating production unit, called FPSO, which will be used to produce oil, is already in Indian waters. ""We will start with 10,000 to 12,000 barrels per day and reach the peak of 45,000 bpd in 2-3 months,"" he had said, adding some gas would also flow with oil but the actual gas output will start in May 2024 when 7-8 mmscmd production is expected.

The production estimates are, however, much lower than what was originally projected.

At the time of its launch in April 2018, ONGC had said the estimated capital expenditure would be USD 5.07 billion, and operational expenditure would be USD 5.12 billion over a field life of 16 years.

The block has several discoveries that have been clubbed into three clusters -- Cluster-1, 2 and 3. Cluster 2 is being put into production first.

Cluster 2 field is divided into two blocks namely -- 2A and 2B, which as per the original investment decision, were expected to produce 23.52 million metric tonnes of oil and 50.70 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas over the life of the field.

Cluster 2A was estimated to contain reserves of 94.26 million tonnes of crude oil and 21.75 bcm of associated gas, while Cluster 2B is estimated to host 51.98 bcm of gas reserves.

Cluster 2A was anticipated to produce 77,305 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and associated gas at a rate of 3.81 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) over 15 years. Cluster 2B is expected to produce free gas of 12.75 mmscmd from eight wells and has a 16-year life.

But now, the output estimate is lower - 45,000 bpd of oil and up to 2.5 mmscmd from Cluster 2A and around 9 mmscmd from Cluster 2B.",726,-0.9795762300491333

Shares of state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) experienced a nearly 4 percent drop in early trade on May 29, following the company's report of a 53 percent decline in its consolidated net profit. The net profit for the fourth quarter of FY23 stood at Rs 5,701 crore, compared to Rs 12,061.44 crore in the corresponding period last year.

As of 10.15 AM, ONGC was trading at Rs 157.60 per share on the National Stock Exchange, reflecting a 3.76 percent decrease from the previous closing price of Rs 163.75.

The company reported a rise in its consolidated total income in Q4FY23 to Rs 166,728.80 crore, against Rs 158,660.49 crore in the year-ago quarter.

On a standalone basis, the company reported a net loss of Rs 248 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 2023 (Q4FY23), compared to the Rs 8,860 crore net profit recorded in the same period of the previous year.

Standalone gross revenue for the state-run oil and gas major increased by 5.2 percent to Rs 36,293 crore from Rs 34,497 crore in the year-ago period.

The company said that its bottom line was hit due to a provision of Rs 12,107 crore made in the quarter towards disputed Service tax and GST on royalty and interest on it in the period between April 1, 2016 and to March 31, 2023.

The company also said that this has been done as a prudent practice, adding, “it shall continue to contest such disputed matters before various forums based on the legal opinion”.

The company's Board has recommended a final dividend of Rs 0.5 per equity share for FY 2022-23. The total dividend for FY’23 would be 225% (Rs.11.25 per share of face value Rs 5 each) with a total payout of Rs. 14,153 crore. This includes interim dividend of 215% (Rs. 10.75 per share) already paid during the year.

During FY 2022-23, ONGC announced a total of eight discoveries, with five on land and three offshore. Among these, three are prospects (two on land and one offshore), while five are pools (three on land and two offshore).

The crude oil (Nominated) realisation for the quarter stood at $77.12 per barrel which is down by 18.8 percent compared to the realisation of $94.98 per barrel during the corresponding period last year.

In rupee terms, the average crude realisation was Rs 6,344 per barrel, 11.2 percent down year-on-year (YoY).

Total crude production during the quarter remained at 5.23 million metric tonnes (mmt) compared to 5.39 million metric tonnes (mmt) produced during the same period a year ago.

The gas production during the quarter was down 1.5 percent on-year to 5.26 billion cubic metres (BCM) compared to 5.33 BCM a year ago.

The production of value-added products dipped 18.7 percent on-year to 612 kilotonnes (KT) from 753 KT.

ONGC's 4Q FY23 standalone EBITDA significantly declined due to various factors: a sharp increase in dry well write-off, lower net crude realization, and a substantial exceptional expense for disputed taxes, said JM Financial Institutional Securities. Production at OVL--wholly owned and overseas subsidiary--gradually recovered, and there was a higher PAT due to the reversal of an impairment charge. The final dividend was limited, leading to a 40 percent payout for FY23. PAT estimates for FY24 and FY25 were reduced, resulting in a revised target price, it said. Despite this, the brokerage firm has maintained its ‘buy’ rating on ONGC stock due to the attractive dividend yield and the market price discounting lower net crude realisation.",619,-0.39519878625869753

Shares of ONGC slipped in the early trade on May 26 ahead of the oil exploration and production company's March quarter earnings announcement.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 2 percent sequential decline in EBITDA, driven by around a 4 percent quarter-on-quarter drop in oil sales. A sequential fall of 8 percent in crude oil prices would likely be offset by a reduction in windfall taxes, it said.

The brokerage firm has baked in overall crude oil sales volumes of 4.5 mmt, down around 4 percent QoQ and 12 percent year on year (YoY). It expects natural gas sales volumes to decline about a percent QoQ but up a percent YoY at 4.16 bcm, gross crude price realisation will fall 8 percent sequentially to $80 per bbl and net oil price realisation post royalty, windfall tax, and cess will be at $53 per bbl, up 1 percent QoQ.

Net sales of ONGC for the March quarter are seen rising 4 percent YoY to Rs 35,772.5 crore but could witness a decline of 7.3 percent sequentially while a 24 percent YoY growth is likely in the profit after tax at Rs 10,957.9 crore, according to Kotak Institutional Equities.

Profitability is also seen improving by 183 basis points YoY and 282 basis points QoQ to 55.7 percent during the quarter under review. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

At 9.55 am, shares of the oil exploration and production company were trading at Rs 163, down 2 percent, on the BSE.

India's flagship overseas oil firm ONGC Videsh has got a new partner in Oil India Ltd to replace a reluctant IndianOil (IOC) for the potential acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in Tullow Oil Plc's USD 3.4 billion oilfield project in Kenya, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

But the OVL-OIL duo now faces competition from super-aggressive Chinese energy giant Sinopec which has entered the fray taking advantage of the delay on the Indian part in finalising the deal.

Originally, ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), was interested in buying out half of the stakes that Tullow, Africa Oil Corp and TotalEnergies SE held in the Lokichar oilfield in Kenya.

The board of OVL had approved the deal, sources said adding the firm however wanted to bring on board IOC, which too had shown interest in the project.

For months, OVL-IOC negotiated the stake in the project. But the transaction couldn't be completed as IOC started having second thoughts, possibly due to financial strains resulting from losses on fuel sales.

Sources said when a Kenyan ministerial delegation visited the India Energy Week in Bengaluru in February, the Indian side informed that IOC would not be going ahead and instead state-owned Oil India Ltd (OIL) will join in.

However, the months of delays led to the Chinese sensing an opportunity. China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) is now sending fillers to Tullow and the other two partners in the project, they said.

Tullow, which is headed by India-origin CEO Rahul Dhir, had originally favoured the Indian consortium as the Kenyan project and the Barmer fields in Rajasthan had a lot of similarities.

As much as 70 per cent of the supply chain sourcing could have been done from India and Dhir, who as CEO of Cairn India Ltd had brought the Rajasthan fields to production more than a decade back, saw a lot of synergy, sources said.

Chinese interest may however spoil the party as Beijing yields considerable influence on the African nation.

The deal being negotiated by OVL-OIL would have made the Indian state-backed firms joint operators of the venture.

Tullow is the present operator of the venture with 50 per cent stake. Africa Oil Corp and TotalEnergies SE have 25 per cent stake each. The three were selling half of their stakes to the Indians.

OVL, an explorer with pursuits in 35 oil and gas assets in 15 nations, would be the lead on the venture, backed by OIL, the nation's second-largest state oil explorer.

Kenya's south Lokichar fields in blocks 10BB and 13T are projected to produce 120,000 barrels of oil per day (6 million tonnes per annum), with anticipated gross oil restoration of 585 million barrels over the total lifetime of the sector.

The waxy crude from the project, which is similar to what is produced from Barmer in Rajasthan, will be shipped from the fields by way of a 20-inch, 825-kilometer heated pipeline to a port in the archipelago of Lamu.

Barmer crude oil too is transported through a 700-km heated pipeline from Barmer deserts to the Gujarat coast.

Indian refiners on the west coast would have been ideal customers of the Kenyan crude, sources said adding it would take three years for the companies to start producing oil from the date the investment decision is made.

The USD 3.4 billion investment includes developing the South Lokichar fields and linking them to Kenya's Indian Ocean port of Lamu via a heated pipeline.",613,-0.9900363087654114

Government headhunter PESB on Tuesday did not make any recommendation for the next chairman of India's largest oil company, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), after interviewing 10 candidates including Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd (CPCL) managing director Arvind Kumar. Kumar and nine others appeared for an interview before Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB) on Tuesday.

After the interview, PESB in an order said, ""The Board did not recommend any candidate and advised the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to take an appropriate course of further action including search-cum-selection committee or as deemed appropriate for the selection with the approval of the competent authority.""

This is the second instance in recent months where PESB did not find a suitable candidate for the top job at blue chip oil companies. On June 3, 2021, it did not find anyone suitable from nine candidates, including two serving IAS officers, to head ONGC.

The ministry thereafter constituted a search-cum-selection panel and named Arun Kumar Singh, who had retired after attaining 60 years of age from Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), to head ONGC. Singh wasn't eligible to apply in the first place but the changed rules made him eligible.

PESB on Tuesday interviewed 10 candidates to replace incumbent chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya who superannuates on attaining 60 years of age on August 31 this year.

Those interviewed include five executive directors of IOC, Container Corporation of India Ltd (Concor) director (finance) Manoj Kumar Dubey and NMDC Ltd director (finance) Amitava Mukherjee.

Two Indian Railway Services officers -- Yatendra Kumar and Ranjan Prakash Thakur -- were also interviewed, the PESB order showed.

IOC executive directors interviewed were Sandeep Jain, Anna Durai, Sailendra Kurumaddali, Sanjay Parashar and Gur Prasad.

No existing directors of IOC applied as most did not have the requisite two years of service left before retirement. Of the six directors, only director (marketing) Satish Kumar Vaduguri had a maximum tenure of 23 months before he retires in July 2025.

Director (research and development) S S V Ramakumar retires in July end of this year. A month before that director (pipelines) D S Nanaware retires while director (refineries) Sukla Mistry and director (planning and business development) Sujoy Choudhury superannuate in April 2024 and August 2024, respectively.

The posts of director (finance) and director (human resources) are vacant.

IOC refines crude oil into products like petrol, diesel, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and aviation turbine fuels. It also makes petrochemicals and retails CNG.

Besides being the backbone of Indian fuel supplies, IOC is pivoting India's energy transition - the shift from fossil-based systems of energy production and consumption -including oil, natural gas and coal, to renewable energy sources like wind and solar, as well as lithium-ion batteries.

IOC owns and operates 10 oil refineries with a combined capacity of 80.6 million tonnes, making up for almost a third of India's 251.2 million tonnes of refining capacity. It also owns 36,285 petrol pumps out of 86,855 pumps in the country. Besides, it owns half of the nation's 25,386 LPG distributors.

The windfall tax on crude petroleum has been slashed to nil from Rs 4,100 per tonne, according to a notification issued by the government late on May 15. The waiver will come into effect from today.

Windfall tax, also referred to as the special additional excise duty (SAED), was already nil on aviation turbine fuel (ATF), petrol and diesel. This has been left unchanged.

The decision to waive off the tax on crude petroleum as well was taken at the fortnightly review conducted by the finance ministry. In the previous review meeting held on May 1, the government had reduced the windfall tax on crude petroleum to Rs 4,100 from Rs 6,400 per tonne.

""This nil windfall tax is on account of softening crude prices and can be increased based on the next fortnightly review. The current removal of windfall tax will increase the net oil realisation of upstream companies (ONGC in our coverage),"" ICICI Securities said in a note.

Windfall wax was introduced by the government on July 1, 2022, to charge the industry for the large profit it has been earning through the sale of refined crude in the international market. Its quantum is reviewed every fortnight, on the basis of the fluctuations in the international crude rates.

Producers, including state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Vedanta-controlled Cairn, were impacted by the windfall tax on domestic crude.

Global crude oil prices rose for the second straight day on May 16, propped up by US plans to purchase oil for its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and by raging wildfires in Canada that fuelled supply worries.

Benchmark Brent crude futures inched up 0.4 percent to $75.53 a barrel.

Earlier, ONGC had urged the government to withdraw profit tax on domestically produced crude oil and instead use the dividend route to tap into the bumper earnings resulting from a surge in global energy prices.

Shares of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) gained more than 3 percent on May 2 after the government reduced windfall tax on crude oil to Rs 4,100 from Rs 6,400 per tonne earlier.

The government has left the windfall tax on petrol, diesel and aviation turbine fuel at zero. The revised duty will be effective from May 2, according to a notification issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs.

The tax rates are reviewed every fortnight based on the average oil prices in the previous two weeks. Last month, the government had cut the windfall tax on petroleum crude to zero from Rs 3,500 per tonne previously with levy for diesel being cut to Rs 0.50 per litre from Rs 1. The levy on crude was hiked to Rs 6,400 per tonne on April 19.

The windfall profit tax refers to the difference between the price that producers receive above a certain threshold. The objective of the tax was to offset the reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel, providing relief to consumers. However, the reduction in the windfall cess from its initial levels is expected to decrease the government's earnings.

From July 1, 2022 onwards, India has implemented the windfall profit tax, following the trend of an increasing number of nations that impose taxes on the super normal profits of energy companies. While export duties were imposed on petrol, diesel and jet fuel (ATF), domestically produced crude oil was subjected to a Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED). Additionally, export duties of Rs 6 per litre on petrol and ATF and Rs 13 a litre on diesel were introduced by New Delhi.

Lenders may soon be reluctant to fund oil and gas projects given it is now considered a ‘sin industry,' states ONGC chairman Arun Singh on April 25. ONGC will now have to generate enough cash internally to continue its business, he added, as reported by the business daily Economic Times.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the news.

The constant concerns that have been coming up regarding climate change issues have alerted some capital funders across the globe, as well as banks and debt and equity funds to stay away from funding projects that raise high emissions.

Singh believes that although, in India, fossil fuel projects have not yet faced any constraints with respect to funding, there still is some fear regarding the same.

""You should be mindful that now if you don't generate your own money, there is no bank money available to you after three years. Your industry is a sin industry,"" the chairman warned the ONGC employees in a town hall the previous week. ""You have to generate enough money from the existing business to fund your own business. You don't have a choice to get outside funds,” Singh added.

Singh added that to generate surplus cash that can be used to fund its business, ONGC needs to contain costs, especially those that can stick around very long since the oil business does not have that long a horizon.

“The future of the conventional area is not looking great. You cannot afford to expand in this space much. You have to grow, you have to generate enough profit, enough production to migrate into some other world,"" he said.

Indian oil marketing companies (OMC), which saw a respite in March when global oil prices slumped below $75 per barrel, are in a tight spot as oil prices are back on the boil.

They are staring at heavy losses if crude prices rise further as they may not be able to pass on this crude price hike to end-consumers, according to analysts.

With the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) deciding to cut production earlier this month, oil prices shot up to over $85 per barrel, close to the level above which Indian OMCs make heavy losses.

“As of last week, OPEC+'s move has only catapulted Brent back to around the mid-$80s level, where it was before the March sell-off. So, as of now, not much damage done,” said Vandana Hari, founder and chief executive officer of Singapore-based energy intelligence company, Vanda Insights.

It will probably become more challenging for refiners and consumers if OPEC+ sticks to the reduction even if global demand starts bounding higher and the market begins to tighten, pushing crude much higher, Hari added.

The pricing math

However, an India-based oil and gas research analyst, who did not wish to be named, said, “Even around these price levels, OMCs are incurring a loss of $2-$3 per litre for diesel.”

The price of Brent crude oil is currently at $87.30 per barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange. It has risen more than 9 percent since March 31.

In normal parlance, the breakeven crude oil price is $85-$88 a barrel, above which OMCs start incurring losses, said Manish Chowdhury, head of research at Stoxbox.

“However, the actual calculation of breakeven is complex as it is dependent on diesel and petrol product cracks, currency movement and respective hedging strategy of OMCs, under-recoveries due to unchanged retail petrol and diesel prices,” he added.

OPEC and its allies shocked the market on April 3 by announcing a production cut of 1.16 million barrels per day from May, which is to last until the end of the year. Adding to this, Russia, an important ally of the cartel, had said in February that it was reducing production by 500,000 barrels per day.

Negative impact

Kotak Institutional Equities believes that the recent spike in oil prices is likely to affect OMCs negatively, especially because these companies may not be able to pass on the rise in crude prices to the end-consumers.

Over the past one year, stock prices of OMCs have underperformed 16 percent when compared with the Nifty50 index.

Shares of downstream OMCs such as Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) have slumped more than 9.5 percent and 8 percent, respectively since March 20 when Brent crude prices fell to $70 per barrel. Experts said these stocks may slide further if global crude rates inch higher.

“A higher oil price is negative for downstream oil marketing companies as under-recoveries on petrol, diesel and LPG may return if prices rise to over $90/bbl as we believe OMCs are unlikely to get pricing freedom at least until 2024 general elections,” a Kotak report said.

Experts believe that crude oil prices are likely to remain elevated in the near term as higher demand from China and a steep fall in US inventories balance economic growth concerns.

“Retail prices remaining unchanged despite a rise in crude oil on a sustained basis could spell trouble for OMCs as it may impact the blended marketing margins of these companies,” Chowdhury of Stoxbox said.

“Moreover, an under-recovery on petroleum products may put further stress on the balance sheets of OMCs,” he said.

$100/bbl price concerns

According to the International Energy Agency, global oil demand is set to surge by 3.2 million barrels a day from 1Q23 to 4Q23, taking average growth for the year to 2 million barrels per day.

At present economic worries are too strong for a 1.2-million-barrel a day reduction by OPEC+ to catapult crude above $90, said Hari.

Having noted that, oil prices may inch closer to the century mark if supply remains lacklustre. This is likely to take a toll on the OMCs in the months to come.

Upstream companies may gain

In terms of upstream companies such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), the recent spike in prices, coupled with the reduction of the windfall tax on domestic oil production, paints a rosier picture. The decision to cut the windfall tax came on the back of lower crude oil prices in March.

Shares of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) closed lower on April 12, as investors resorted to profit booking after the stock surged nearly 6 percent in the previous two sessions.

ONGC surged in the last two days after the government accepted key recommendations of the Kirit Parikh panel with respect to the pricing of natural gas produced from the administered price mechanism (APM) fields, which are held by public sector undertaking companies.

The APM gas structure is likely to benefit companies such as ONGC as it will have a floor price of $4 and a ceiling of $6.5. For the state-run ONGC, the floor price is higher than the cost of production, a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.

The new mechanism also guarantees a 20 percent premium for the production of gas from new wells or interventions from existing wells. This is likely to be profitable for companies such as ONGC and Oil India Ltd.

Additionally, ONGC had announced that it was preparing to bet billions of dollars on deepwater and ultra-deepwater exploration even as the state-run company's oil and gas production continues to decline.

The company plans to bid aggressively in upcoming government auctions to increase its exploration acreage to 500,000 square kilometers by March 2026 from the current 163,000 square kilometers. Annual spending will rise to 110 billion rupees from an annual 70 billion to 80 billion rupees.

ONGC's oil production has declined to 16.88 million tonnes during April-February period of the fiscal year 2022-23 from 20.80 million tonnes in the fiscal year 2018.

The ONGC stock has been in the red in the past year, falling nearly 7 percent on the BSE but has given a return of 104 percent in the last three years.

On April 12, the stock closed almost a percent lower at Rs 157.70 on the BSE.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp. is preparing to bet billions of dollars on deepwater and ultra-deepwater exploration, boosting spending in a push that could help one of the world’s top oil importing nations reduce reliance on overseas supply.

“Onshore we have more or less drilled, appraised or acquired data in most of the basins,” Sushma Rawat, director of exploration for the state-owned giant, said in an interview. “But there are still large tracts offshore where we have very sparse data, where almost no wells have been drilled.”

India, with a fast-growing apptite for crude, is eager to reduce its fuel import bill and bolster energy security, and has encouraged companies like state-controlled ONGC to do more to tap domestic oil and gas reserves. It’s a gamble that, if successful, would yield rewards for producers and for a government looking to reduce its overseas dependence.

Rawat said ONGC plans to bid aggressively in upcoming government auctions to increase its exploration acreage to 500,000 square kilometers (193,050 square miles) by March 2026, from around 163,000 square kilometers today. Annual spending will rise to 110 billion rupees ($1.3 billion) from an annual 70 billion to 80 billion rupees.

For ONGC, the exploration push is also about countering a decline in production. In the decade to the end of March last year, oil output dropped 17.5% to 19.6 million tons, while gas shrank just over 10% to 20.9 billion cubic meters — a decline that has left India vulnerable to surging import costs.

ONGC accounts for 66% of India’s oil output and 58% of its gas. That’s partly offshore, but in shallow waters. The only producing deepwater project is its KG-DWN-98/2 block in the Krishna Godavari basin. Crude oil output there is due to start in May — well past the original target of 2019.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government had set a goal of cutting imports by 10% by 2022 and halve them by 2030, but missed the first target, with import dependence increasing instead. No fresh goals have been publicly announced, but India last year released nearly one million square kilometers of acreage previously closed to exploration for military, environmental and other reasons.

Rawat and officials at ONGC want to leverage the opportunity, trying to speed up efforts by striking a string of partnerships with Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and TotalEnergies SE. ONGC holds just over half of the country’s leased exploration acreage, making it an appealing partner.

Now the challenge for ONGC is to turn broad agreements into tangible exploration alliances, said Angus Rodger, upstream research director for Asia Pacific at Wood Mackenzie: “The Indian government wants to see new partnerships emerge, between Indian players and the best international explorers.”

The global oil majors, wary of the risks associated with India’s offshore potential, are pushing for better conditions from the Indian government, Rawat said, including with the addition of clauses on arbitration, reassurance around the stability of the fiscal regime and on criminal liability.",502,0.38056265456335886

The government’s new pricing regime for domestic natural gas is likely to be positive for city gas distributors (CGDs) in the near-term, according to Kotak Institutional Equities.

“For CGDs, our margin assumptions are unchanged, but a more gradual rise in gas cost improves the near-term volume growth outlook,” Kotak said in a report.

The brokerage maintained ‘Buy’ call on the stocks of Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL) and Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL). It has also revised the future value of IGL to Rs 515 from Rs 495, while it sees MGL’s price at Rs 1,115 from Rs 1,100 earlier.

The new regime, administered price mechanism (APM), unveiled last week reflects the adoption of some of the key recommendations made by the Kirit Parikh Panel, set to decide the deregulation of gas prices in India.

The domestic gas pricing will be linked with the imported crude pricing and would be at 10 percent of the Indian crude basket. It will be revised on a monthly basis. The formula for the new gas pricing mechanism will include a floor and ceiling at $4 and $6.5. The ceiling will be kept in force for the next two years.

The government has set $9.16 per mmbtu for April 1-7 and $7.92 per mmbtu for the rest of the month. The ceiling price of $6.5 came into force from April 8.

“Despite the declining trend of APM production, we assume no cut in APM allocation to CGDs,” according to the report. “We assume an 8 percent annual growth in CGDs’ priority sector volumes, driven by growth in legacy large cities (Delhi NCR, in particular) and several upcoming areas,” the report added.

For upstream companies such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), the brokerage said that even though the gradual increase in the APM price is negative, the companies may benefit from a rising share of gas from new wells over the medium term. According to the new regime, gas from new wells in APM blocks will fetch these companies a 20 percent premium.

Kotak has reiterated ‘Add’ call on the stocks of ONGC and OIL. It has reduced the future value of ONGC to Rs 160 from Rs 165 and to Rs 255 from Rs 265 for OIL.",412,0.612667465209961

The Centre on April 7 announced that natural gas will be priced at $7.92 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for the period of April 8 to April 30. However, rates for customer are capped at $6.5/mmBtu.

The revised rate is as per a new pricing formula wherein price is at 10 percent of imported cost of crude oil, as per the Oil Ministry’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell. The new formula was suggested by the Kirit Parikh committee.

The cap has also been set in the order issued. It states: ""For the gas produced by ONGC/ OIL from their nomination fields, the price shall be subject to a ceiling of $6.5 per mmBtu.”

The order

Compressed natural gas (CNG) and piped natural gas (PNG) meet close to 70 percent of demand supply. The new formula will be applicable on natural gas produced from legacy or old fields, known as APM (administered price mechanism) gas.

As per the formula this gas will now be indexed to the price of imported crude, instead of benchmarking it to gas prices in four surplus nations of Oman, the United States, Canada and Russia.

Accordingly, APM gas will be priced at 10 percent of the price of the India crude basket, but capped at $6.5/mmBtu. The floor or base price is $4/mmBtu.

The ceiling means an average reduction of 10 percent in CNG and PNG prices for customers as the rate was $8.57/mmBtu.

MGL slashes prices

Soon after the order came, Gail India subsidiary Mahanagar Gas (MGL) on April 7 announced cuts to the retail price of CNG by Rs 8/kg and of PNG by Rs 5/SCM across its licenced area. Revised prices are now Rs 79/kg for CNG and Rs 49/SCM for PNG.

“MGL is pleased to pass the benefit of the source price reduction in domestic gas cost onto its domestic PNG and CNG consumers. Accordingly, the price of CNG is reduced by Rs 8/kg and domestic PNG is down by Rs 5/SCM in and around Mumbai,” a late evening statement from the city gas distributor said.

India had imposed windfall tax for the first time in July 2022 on domestic crude oil producers to restrict unusually high profits of these companies.

When global oil prices had risen to above $100 per barrel, domestic refiners wanted to make gains from robust refining margins in overseas markets, instead of selling it within the country.

The government levies tax on windfall profits made by oil producers on any price they get above a threshold of $75 per barrel, according to a report by the Economics Times.

Shares of ONGC had risen on Monday as well after crude prices climbed more than 5 percent. Additionally, with the windfall tax now scrapped on all crude exports, except diesel, shares of the company are likely to trade higher in the short term.

Every $1-a-barrel rise in crude realisation implies a 2-4 percent increase in earnings per share for companies such as ONGC and Oil India, according to analysts’ calculations.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is stepping up a USD 7 billion investment over the next three-four years to reverse years of decline in oil and gas production, company's director for production Pankaj Kumar said.

Up to 24 field development, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and improved oil recovery (IOR) projects are currently in progress that will further help reverse the declining trend in oil and gas production.

""Most of our fields are old where natural decline has set in. But we are heavily investing in technology to raise recovery as well as tap isolated reservoirs,"" he told PTI.

ONGC is investing USD 5 billion-plus in development of the Cluster-II region of its flagship KG-DWN-98/2 asset in the Krishna Godavari basin offshore India's eastern coast.

It also has multiple field developments in the west coast region, including a planned fifth phase of redevelopment of Mumbai High along with the development of neighbouring fields like Daman, he said, adding these ongoing projects involve an investment of Rs 60,000 crore (more than USD 7 billion) over the next three-four years.

""We are investing in multiple enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and improved oil recovery (IOR) projects,"" he said. ""In the fiscal year ending March 31, we managed to arrest the decline in output after five years and from the current fiscal we will see production rising."" ONGC is likely to see output rise from 19.6 million tonnes in 2022-23 to 21.2 million tonnes in the current fiscal (April 2023 to March 2024) on a standalone basis. Natural gas output is projected to rise from 20.6 billion cubic meters in 2022-23 to 23.5 bcm in the current fiscal.

India imports 85 per cent of its crude oil requirements and about half of its natural gas needs. Crude oil is refined to produce fuels like petrol and diesel while gas is used to generate electricity, produce fertiliser and turned into CNG for running automobiles and piped into household kitchens for cooking.

Foreign exchange outgo on oil and gas imports has been a big drain on the Indian economy and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been pushing to cut imports through greater domestic exploration and production.

India's domestic crude oil and natural gas production has been dwindling in recent years and ONGC is under pressure from the government to boost its oil output and reverse the trend.

WESTERN COAST On the western coast, ONGC's main producing assets of Mumbai High, Neelam and Heera and Bassein & Satellite sit in the Arabian Sea. These assets are currently producing 41.5 million cubic meters a day (mmscmd) of gas and about 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) or 14 million tonnes of oil per annum.

Kumar said some of the key developments being targeted by ONGC on the western coast region include additional developments of the Ratna & R Series and North Tapti fields as well as development of upside potential of Daman field and development of Cluster 9, BS-17 field, MB-0SN-2005/1 and four contract area that the company got in recent discovered field licensing round.

The Mumbai High asset is ONGC's largest oil-producing offshore asset and has been producing for nearly five decades. The company is currently executing the fourth phase of its redevelopment which will get over in May 2023.

""We are working on the fifth phase of Mumbai High redevelopment that will add 12,500 barrels per day of peak production,"" he said.

Daman Upside Development would add 6 mmscmd of gas and 4,200 barrels of oil per day.

EASTERN DEVELOPMENTS On the east coast, ONGC's main asset is Block KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5). It is currently developing oil and gas discoveries in what is called Cluster-II of the block. The field has already started producing gas and it is being ramped up in phases. This project is expected to contribute about 12 mmscmd of gas and up to 45,000 barrels per day of oil at peak.

ONGC is looking to develop the Cluster 1 project in block, he said.

The firm has a few more projects lined up on the East Coast which are under the advanced stage of studies and conceptualisation. And with all these, he sounded that significantly good gas and oil numbers are expected from the East Coast as well.",715,0.404690614768437

With the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies agreeing to cut output once again, crude prices have shot up and are likely to weigh on the performance of oil marketing companies (OMCs) in India, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report on April 3.

“A higher oil price is negative for downstream oil marketing companies as under-recoveries on petrol, diesel and LPG may return if oil prices rise to over $90/bbl as we believe,” Kotak said.

OPEC and its allies in a surprise move late on April 2, decided to cut oil output by 1.16 million barrels a day from May. The move was aimed at stabilising the market after prices had slumped in March due to fears that emerged out of the banking crisis in the US.

Brent crude prices shot up over 6 percent after markets opened on April 3. At 5.25 pm, the price of Brent oil on the Intercontinental Exchange was at $85 a barrel, up 6.4 percent from the previous close.

In October 2022, the group agreed to reduce oil output by 2 million barrels per day. The latest OPEC decision along with Russia’s voluntary production cut of 500,000 barrels per day will take a total of 3.66 million barrels off the market, which is roughly 3.6 percent of the total world supply.

OMCs have had a rough year in 2022 as they had to hold back pump prices despite crude touching multi-year highs. This led to the companies suffering steep losses.

Several reports have already projected oil prices to increase by $10 a barrel after OPEC’s decision.

“OMCs are unlikely to get pricing freedom at least until the 2024 general elections. For upstream companies, there will not be any benefits from higher oil prices, as windfall taxes limit oil price realisation to about US$75/bbl,” Kotak said in its report.

The brokerage has given a ‘sell’ rating for the stocks of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL). It has ‘add’ call on the stocks of ONGC and Oil India, and ‘reduce’ for Indian Oil Corporation. For the oil sector as a whole, Kotak has a ‘neutral’ view.

Meanwhile, the brokerage has also said that the output cut declared by the oil-producing group is a much bigger one than the one from October last year. When OPEC announced a reduction in the supply of oil by 2 million barrels per day last year, several member countries were already producing below their target, which made the actual output cut smaller.

“In contrast, the current cut has been announced by countries that are producing at target levels or higher. Thus, the likelihood of the entire 1.5-1.6mb/d production being cut is high, in our view,” Kotak said.

On April 3, shares of both HPCL and BPCL ended over 4 percent in the red at Rs 225.95 apiece and Rs 330.25 per piece, respectively on NSE. Oil India’s stock ended at Rs 261 per share, up 3.7 percent, while ONGC closed at Rs 153.75 apiece, up 1.8 percent from the previous close.

Shares of upstream companies such as ONGC and Oil India edged higher in the morning trade on April 3 on the back of a spike in crude oil prices a day after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies announced a surprise production cut.

Brent crude on Intercontinental Exchange jumped more than 5 percent, as OPEC and allies agreed to trim collective production by another 1.16 million barrels a day from May.

Every $1-a-barrel rise in crude realisation implies a 2-4 percent increase in earnings per share for these two companies, according to analysts’ calculations.

At 10.15 am, ONGC shares were up 4 percent at Rs 156.80 on the BSE, while Oil India was nearly six percent higher at Rs 266.10.

OPEC shock

On April 2, OPEC’s kingpin Saudi Arabia announced a voluntary output cut of 500,000 barrels a day, starting May, while another key member of the cartel, Iraq, said it would reduce supply by 211,000 barrels a day. Along with this, other members such as UAE, Kuwait and Oman, too, will trim supplies, bringing the total cut to 1.16 million barrels a day.

The move was aimed at market stability as oil prices had suffered heavy losses in March due to fears that emerged out of the banking crisis in the US, OPEC said.

The decision came as a jolt to the market as the cartel already has a 2-million-barrels-per-day production cut in place, which it agreed to in October. The total cut in output now stands at more than 3.5 million barrels a day, effectively 3.5 percent of global supply.

OMCs sink

Shares of oil marketing companies (OMCs), however, took a beating after oil prices gained sharply. Higher oil prices increase the input cost of companies such as Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum (BPCL).

At 10.11 am, Bharat Petroleum was quoting at Rs 335.45, down 2.5 percent from the previous close. HPCL declined over 4 percent to trade at Rs 232.15.

OMCs in India suffered steep losses last year after they had to hold pump prices despite red-hot crude. OMCs typically revise retail petrol and diesel prices daily based on the rolling average of international benchmark prices over the past 15 days. However, they left prices unchanged in 2022 despite soaring crude prices to control inflation, which dented their bottom line.

The state-run oil company, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on March 31 contributed Rs 100 crore to the Prime Minister's Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM CARES Fund) to assist in the fight against the current surge of COVID-19 cases in India.

ONGC's contribution is intended to support the Indian government's efforts to bolster the healthcare infrastructure and combat the COVID-19 and H3N2 influenza viruses, according to a press release from the company.

During the first wave of the pandemic in April 2020, ONGC contributed Rs 300 crore to the PM CARES Fund. In 2020, oil companies, including ONGC and the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), contributed over Rs 1,000 crore to the PM CARES Fund to support the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

ONGC also contributed an additional Rs 70 crore to the fund in FY 2021-22 to maintain the medical equipment purchased by Oil Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) during the two waves of the pandemic.

In 2015, public sector undertaking (PSU) and energy major Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) set up ‘The Facilitation Center’, which acted as a single platform for employee-to-employee services like carpooling, renting or selling flats and houses, and even matrimonial alliances.

The feature was developed for all employees, irrespective of their work locations.

As of February 2023, more than 10,000 employees have availed various services.

The marriage service helps employees to find a suitable match within the ONGC community. The portal provides a platform for employees to upload their profiles and search for potential matches based on their preferences.

“The intention of including the marriage service within the company or among relatives and friends was to provide a platform for the employees to connect and to promote a sense of community within the organisation,” AP Singh, Executive Director of HR, ONGC India, told Moneycontrol.

With around 27,000 employees, Singh said ONGC is a large organisation with a vast workforce spread across various locations, and it can be challenging for employees to find suitable matches outside the company's community.

All data relating to the marriageable population reside in this single database.

While the exact number of employees who have benefited from this service is not available, more than 3,400 employees and their family members have used ONGC's management portal to seek partners for them or their sons and daughters.

What about retention?

Another service on the management portal is carpooling. Carpooling is an environment-friendly initiative to encourage employees to share their ride to work. The portal provides a platform for employees to connect with other employees who live nearby and share the same route to work.

“This not only reduces the number of cars on the road but also helps employees to save money on fuel,” Singh said.

Apart from these services, the management portal offers online training, health services, and employee welfare services. The portal has been designed to be scalable, and ONGC plans to add more in the future.

“The management portal could potentially provide services related to mental health and well-being, such as access to counsellors or mindfulness programmes. The portal could also potentially provide services related to career development and upskilling, such as access to online courses and training programmes,” Singh said.

In addition to expanding the services, he said ONGC may also consider improving the existing services to better meet the needs of the employees. For example, the marriage service offered by the management portal could potentially be improved by providing more options for employees to filter and search for suitable matches based on their preferences.

While specific data on the usage of services provided by ONGC's management portal is not available, Singh said it is reasonable to assume that the availability of these services has helped to create a more employee-friendly work environment and has had a positive impact on talent retention.

“....the management portal helps to create a sense of belongingness and fosters a more supportive work environment, which can lead to higher employee satisfaction and retention,” he added.

As of 2021-22, attrition at ONGC remains less than 1 percent.

Oil marketing companies' (OMCs) profitability was hit in 2022 when they had to hold pump prices despite rising crude.

OMCs typically revise retail petrol and diesel prices daily based on the rolling average of international benchmark prices over the past 15 days. However, they left prices unchanged in 2022 despite soaring crude prices to control inflation in the country, which dented their bottom line.

""As international oil prices cool, marketing losses will ease for the three state-owned refining and marketing companies, IOC, BPCL and HPCL,” ratings agency Moody’s said.

Shares of upstream companies like ONGC and Oil India took a beating. ONGC shares were down 2.5 percent at Rs 148.50 on the NSE, while Oil India was down 3 percent at Rs 250, around 9:45 am.

(Representative Image)

Morgan Stanley on February 21 released a bullish report on the Indian energy sector, saying its “slow and steady metamorphosis” would propel future prospects.

Increased output by Indian oil producers at a time when the world’s production is declining was the main theme of the report.

Morgan Stanley named Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India as key picks in the energy sector.

“ONGC and Oil India are seeing a structural shift in their return quality as they kick-start production growth after more than a decade, commodity prices remain higher and government policies keep hydrocarbon pricing in India closer to market prices as subsidies unwind,” said the report.

Investors in the energy sector lost track of this shift in return quality since windfall taxes were introduced in July 2022. However, Morgan Stanley analysts noted that structural reforms undertaken over the past six months, especially for upstream producers (producers involved in exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas) like ONGC and Oil India are likely to gradually ease decades of challenges.

Analysts at the investment firm also believe that the earnings quality and returns of ONGC and Oil India have reached an inflection point and are expected to see a positive movement. They noted that both the well-capitalized companies have returned more cash to their shareholders than their current market caps since 2008. This is an attractive point as Morgan Stanley expects the Average Selling Prices (ASPs) to double this decade.

ONGC’s total dividend payments since 2008 amount to $25 billion in dividends since 2008, weathering declining production and several government interventions. As ASPs of its domestic hydrocarbon double over the next 10 years, Morgan Stanley expects dividends to also follow suit, even with limited volume growth.

Morgan Stanley raised the target price for ONGC to Rs 199 from Rs 177 to “reflect higher crude price realisations, lower international capex and higher gas prices.”

Coming to Oil India, Morgan Stanley notes that although the company accounts for a tenth of India's total hydrocarbon production, it is one of the best volume growth plays in the industry.

“Volume growth is higher than management guidance and dividend yield remains attractive,” said the brokerage report. Higher productions, refining margins and gas ASPs are expected to push up earnings by 1-10 percent, it said.

The target price of Oil India was also raised to Rs 323 from Rs 253.

“We forecast ONGC and Oil India to have 2-5 percent production growth as well as significant upside in their downstream fuel businesses in 2023. Their dividend yields at 8-12 percent are also in the top quartile vs. global peers,” Morgan Stanley analysts observed.​

At the end of the trading hours on February 22, Oil India closed 2.39 percent lower at Rs 248.70, whereas ONGC shed 0.32 percent to close at Rs 153.60, on the NSE.",498,0.708644300699234

Global oil demand is set to hit a record high of 101.9 million barrels/day (b/d) in CY23, and this will be a big positive for Reliance Industries and weigh heavily on oil-market companies (OMCs) bottomline, according to a report by Nomura.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has said that oil demand is set to grow by 2 million b/d year-on-year (YoY) to hit a record in CY23. According to the brokerage firm, this will be driven by China reopening, with the country seeing an incremental demand of 0.9 million b/d, which will be 45 percent of the incremental global oil demand.

According to Nomura’s analysts, this will cause a sharp improvement in refining margins and that will benefit particularly RIL, with the refiner’s SEZ refinery exempt from Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED) and windfall taxes. The analysts see around 16 percent upside to the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,850.

“The outlook for refining remains robust for CY2023 underpinned by strong oil demand growth of 2 mn b/d, which will significantly outpace refinery throughput additions of 1.5 mn b/d in CY2023,” said the brokerage’s report.

This should come as a relief to refiners because their margins had been impacted in recent weeks by the decline in diesel spreads with the sharp inventory build-up in the European Union (EU), which was looking to build stockpiles prior to sanctioning of Russian petroleum products.

“However, refining margins are anticipated to improve sharply from current levels given the significant uptick in demand over 2HCY23 — global oil demand is anticipated to rise by 2.4 mn b/d y-y in 2HCY23 and by 2.1mn b/d versus 1HCY23, underpinned by robust growth across China and other Asian countries, whereas incremental refinery throughput will be lower at 1.5 mn b/d,” stated Nomura’s report.

The analysts also expect Russian refiners to cut their utilisation rates because they have been finding it hard to place their products.

“We believe RIL (RIL IN, Buy) is best placed to take advantage of the refining upcycle; furthermore, with the removal of the SAED/windfall taxes on the company’s SEZ refinery, RIL will be able to capture premiums on supplying products to Europe. We see upside risks to our refining margin estimates of $12/bbl in FY2024F and note that RIL’s EPS has 4 percent sensitivity for every $1/bbl of refining margins. We reiterate our Buy rating and TP of Rs 2,850; RIL is our top pick in the Indian oil and gas space,” they wrote.

They do not have the same optimism about other upstream companies such as ONGC and Oil India, on which they have a reduced call, because they see the government increasing SAED obligations for them to limit realisations to around $75/bbl.

‘Reduce’ on OMCs

Nomura’s analysts retained their reduce rating for all three PSU OMCs (HPCL, BPCL and IOCL), adding that the Street’s optimism on the marketing companies is likely to be short-lived because there are “clear headwinds to the recent improvement in marketing margins”. The marketing companies have recently benefited from moderation in crude oil prices and in diesel spreads with the European Union’s stockpiling.

The brokerage’s analysts said that both benefits are likely to “fade away” with the unfolding market dynamics and the surge in demand in the second half of CY23.

The marketing companies are still grappling with their huge debt piles--IOCL’s gross debt has increased 30 percent to Rs 1.4 lakh crore from end-FY22 levels; BPCL’s debt has increased by 20 percent to Rs 40,300 crore; and HPCL’s gross debt has increased 49 percent to Rs 64,200 crore. Added to this will be the elevated crude oil prices and unyielding capex, all of which will “significantly impact cash flows”.

The market seems to be inching upwards gradually along with a shift in support as the Nifty50 climbed higher for the third week in a row, rising half a percent in the week ended February 17. The index has formed a bullish candle with upper and lower shadows on the weekly scale, indicating volatility.

Further, it has been making higher high for the week gone by, and higher low for second straight week. The index has breached the Budget day's high but there was some selling pressure at higher levels, leading to a close at 17,944.

The Nifty50 has crucial support in the 17,700-17,900 area, hence as long as it holds the same, 18,200-18,300 appear likely in the coming sessions, experts said.

Even the Options data indicated that 18,000 strike has maximum open interest on the Call as well as Put side, indicating a tug-of-war between bulls and bears.

""The recent price action could be seen as a constructive development for our markets as the index hover above the sloping trendline and has also attempted to transcend the sturdy hurdle of the 18,000 mark after two weeks of consolidation,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

As far as levels are concerned, he remains hopeful till the sacrosanct support of 17,800-17,700 is withheld firmly. On the flip side, sustenance above 18,000 could only bring the cheer back in the market, while on the higher end, 18,200 is likely to be the sturdy wall in a comparable period, says Sameet.

Despite the lacklustre moves in the indices, individual pockets kept buzzing and experts expect this to continue.

Hence, Sameet advocate traders to focus on a stock-specific approach for better trading opportunities and stay with a similar buy on decline strategy till the time important supports are held comfortably.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the February 17 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

HDFC: Buy | LTP: 2,694 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,580 | Target: Rs 2,950 | Return: 10 percent

The stock has been consolidating above Rs 2,600 level for quite some time now. Even though there was a weakness in the market, the stock held above the thin support line, otherwise it follows the market trend most of the time.

Technically, we can call it as a bullish divergence, which will reward positional traders in a bullish move in the market. The strategy should be to buy 50 percent at current levels and balance at Rs 2,650. Place stop-loss at Rs 2,580. On the upside, there could be a rally towards Rs 2,850 or Rs 2,950 in the medium term.

Tata Power Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 205 | Stop-Loss: Rs 190 | Target: Rs 230 | Return: 12 percent

The stock has been in the rectangle trading range for almost the last 15 months. It is following the trading range of Rs 190 and Rs 250. In the last eight weeks, the stock managed to stay above Rs 190 level, bucking the broad market trend, which had plunged to new lows.

The reward-to-risk ratio at the current levels is in favour of the bulls. Buy Tata Power between Rs 205 and Rs 195. For this, keep the stop-loss at Rs 190. On the upside, the stock may move towards Rs 230 with facing minor resistance near Rs 220.

Asian Paints: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,834 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,680 | Target: Rs 3,100 | Return: 9 percent

The stock has formed a higher bottom after touching highly oversold levels. It was at Rs 3,580 in the month of September 2022 and since then the stock was falling. It touched the level of Rs 2,685, which was the higher bottom level compared to the previous low of Rs 2,560.

Such type of pattern mostly favours the bulls, however, a breakdown of recent lows invites further weakness.

Traders can take a tactical trading call at current levels and on the further downside and keep a tight stop-loss at Rs 2,680. On the upside, it would find resistance near Rs 3,000 and Rs 3,100.

Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi

Borosil Renewables: Buy | LTP: Rs 478 | Stop-Loss: Rs 445 | Target: Rs 535 | Return: 12 percent

The free fall which started from July 20, 2022 resulted in 38 percent cut in price. At current juncture, the said counter has formed bullish Butterfly pattern which is looking lucrative at current market price.

From indicator perspective, daily RSI (relative strength index) has made bullish divergence along impulsive structure near oversold level of 30.

One can buy in the range of Rs 470-480 and target would be Rs 535 with a stop-loss of Rs 445 on daily close basis.

Indiabulls Housing Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 113 | Stop-Loss: Rs 104 | Target: Rs 130 | Return: 15 percent

The relentless fall which started from December 30, 2022 resulted in 33 percent cut in price. At current juncture, the said counter has formed Bullish Engulfing pattern exactly around 0.618 retracement of its previous rally which started from September 2022.

In addition, buying volume is also picking up from lower levels thus confirming bullish stance in the counter. From indicator perspective, daily RSI has made bullish divergence along impulsive structure near oversold level of 30.

From the indicator perspective, on a daily scale of MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram and RSI bullish divergence was seen thus confirming the bullish stance in the counter.

One can buy in the range of Rs 480-486 with a target of Rs 530 and a stop-loss of Rs 455 on a daily close basis.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

ONGC: Buy | LTP: Rs 156.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 148 | Target: Rs 170 | Return: 9 percent

The stock has been forming a ‘Higher Top Higher Bottom’ on the daily and weekly chart and is thus in an uptrend. The ’89 DEMA’ (day exponential moving average) has acted as a support in the recent corrective phase and prices witnessed a positive momentum during last week and have given a breakout above its resistances.

The RSI oscillator is in ‘buy mode’ indicating a positive momentum. Hence, short term traders can look for buying opportunities around current market price of Rs 156 for near term targets of Rs 165 and Rs 170. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 148.

Bosch: Buy | LTP: Rs 18,014 | Stop-Loss: Rs 17,600 | Target: Rs 19,300 | Return: 7 percent

The stock has consolidated within a range in last few weeks and has formed an ‘Inverted Head and Shoulders’ pattern on the weekly chart. Prices are on the verge of a breakout from the pattern and the momentum readings on the daily and the weekly chart are indicating a positive momentum.

During last week, we witnessed a gradual rise in volumes and hence we expect a positive move soon in the stock.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock around above Rs 18,250 for potential targets around Rs 18,900 and Rs 19,300. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 17,600.

Expert: Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio

Oil and natural gas producers of India reported profits in the third quarter of financial year 2022-23 due to high oil and gas realisation.

State-run explorers Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Limited (OIL) booked profits in the December quarter as the former reported year-on-year (YoY) growth of 26 percent in standalone net profit at Rs 11,045 crore, while Oil India Ltd posted 40 percent increase in net profit at Rs 1,746.10 crore.

Most brokerages maintain Buy rating on ONGC, as the country’s largest explorer met market expectations.

“We maintain our BUY recommendation on ONGC with a target price of Rs 170, based on (1) an increase in crude price realisation, and (2) an improvement in domestic gas price realisation. Q3FY23 revenue/EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) at Rs 386/204 bn, came in marginally above our estimates, but APAT, at Rs 110 bn, came below estimates due to higher-than-expected DD&A and finance costs and lower-than-expected other income,” said HDFC Securities in a note.

Production of oil and natural gas by ONGC largely came in line with market expectations in the quarter. Analysts are optimistic about ONGC’s production growth in 2023, as commencement of oil production from KG Basin is expected in May or June of the year.

“First oil from the KG Basin is expected in May/June 2023. Incremental production guidance stands at 1.9mmt of oil and 2.8bcm of gas in FY24 and 2.2mmt and 3.8bcm in FY25. At the peak, incremental production could be 45kbopd and 12mmscmd in FY25,” said Motilal Oswal in a report.

Meanwhile, Oil India said the company posted its highest-ever profit in the quarter due to better realisation and increase in production. In Q3, oil production of the company increased 7.03 percent from a year earlier, while gas production grew by 1.64 percent.

“Oil India reported consolidated EBITDA/PAT of Rs 41.8 bn (+55 percent Q/Q)/Rs 25.3 bn (+20 percent Q/Q), led by healthy crude oil & gas realisation, along with steady Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) performance. Standalone EBITDA came at Rs 28.6 bn (+54 percent Q/Q PLe Rs 24.1 bn) due to lower other expense, while PAT remained flat at Rs 17.5 bn (PLe Rs 15.6 bn),” said the brokerage Prabhudas Lilladhar.

Windfall tax impact

Quarterly results of exploration and production companies were impacted by implementation of windfall tax on crude oil. However, windfall tax is revised every 15 days in line with international crude oil prices.

“While the levy of windfall tax by the Centre with fortnightly revision had raised concerns on the realisations of upstream companies, the government has adjusted windfall taxes in line with crude oil fluctuations. Our estimate suggests that the government is allowing a post-windfall realisation of $68-81/bbl and we expect the same to remain at ~$70/bbl for FY24-25E,” said Motilal Oswal in a report.

On February 16, the Indian government reduced the windfall tax on domestically-produced crude oil to Rs 4,350 per tonne from Rs 5,050 per tonne. The government had first implemented windfall tax on domestic production of crude oil in July 2022 to arrest large profits booked by oil producers due to high global crude oil prices.

Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), a state-run oil and gas major, reported a standalone profit of Rs 11,045 crore for the third quarter ended December 2022 (Q3FY23), which represents a growth of 26 percent over the Rs 8,764 crore profit it registered in the year-ago period.

However, the profit was down 14 percent from Rs 12,826 crore in the September quarter. The standalone revenue of the company surged 36 percent to Rs 38,583 crore from Rs 28,473 crore in the year-ago period.

On a sequential basis, the revenue was flat with a marginal gain of one percent from Rs 38,321 crore.

In its earnings release, the company cited that the uncertainties and constraints across the global supply chain due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict had adversely affected the production of crude oil and gas.

Here's what brokerages say about the stock post its Q3 results:

CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 225 | Upside: 53%

- Based on the Q3 results of ONGC Ltd, CLSA has a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 225 per share, representing an upside of 53 percent from the current market price.

- Earnings were a miss on higher exploration costs and operating expenses. ONGC has the highest dividend yield in the Asian large cap space.

Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 190 | Upside: 29%

- The brokerage firm changed its consolidated earnings estimates for FY23, FY24, and FY25 by -31 percent, 8 percent, and 5 percent, respectively.

- The revisions factor in higher FY23 losses of Rs 88 billion, a cut in MRPL's FY23 estimates by 83 percent towards windfall tax impact, and higher crude oil realizations for FY24/25E to USD 75/75 per barrel.

- The brokerage firm maintains a buy rating with a target of Rs 190 based on 3.5x EV/E FY24E.

- Prabhudas Lilladher expects ONGC's oil and gas production to increase by 4-5 percent with the KG98/2 field coming on stream.

State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) expects commissioning of oil production from the KG Basin in the month May or June of 2023, the company said in an investor call on February 15.

“We are expecting our first oil (from KG Basin) by May or June 2023 and you will be getting free gas production in May 2024,” said Pawan Agarwal, Chief Corporate Planning and Strategy, ONGC.

In 2023, ONGC will benefit from the incremental oil production from KG Basin, added Agarwal.

The oil and gas major was initially expected to begin gas production from the Cluster-II fields of KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 project in June 2019, while oil production was anticipated to begin from March 2020. However, the company missed the deadlines.

ONGC blamed the coronavirus restrictions, engineering changes and project execution challenges for the delay.

Standalone revenue for the state-run oil and gas major surged 36 percent to Rs 38,583 crore from Rs 28,473 crore in the year-ago period. The growth in revenue and earnings was driven largely by a surge in APM gas prices compared to last year.​",225,0.20109686851501465

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd and state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) are separately auctioning natural gas extracted from coal seams at prices linked to Brent crude oil price.

Reliance is seeking a minimum USD 12.75 per million British thermal unit for coal bed methane (CBM) from a block in Shahdol district of Madhya Pradesh, while ONGC wants USD 9.35 for the same kind of fuel from North Karanpura in Jharkhand, according to tender documents.

Reliance has sought bids for sale of 0.65 million standard cubic meters per day from CBM block SP(West)-CBM-2001/1 for one year beginning April 1, 2023, the company's tender document showed.

It asked bidders to quote a variable 'v' as a percentage of dated Brent crude oil price.

Starting bid price has been kept as 15 per cent of Brent ('v' = 15 per cent). At the current Brent price of USD 85 per barrel, this translates into a price of USD 12.75 per mmBtu. e-bidding will happen on February 24.

ONGC has offered 0.015 mmscmd of gas from North Karanpura (NK) block in Jharkhand for 3 years. It asked bidders to quote a premium 'p' as a percentage of Brent price.

The reserve or bid start price has been kept at 11 per cent of Dated Brent price (USD 9.35 per mmBtu at Brent oil price of USD 85 per barrel).

Price of gas ""shall be higher of the reserve gas price plus quoted premium (p) or floor price plus quoted premium (p),"" ONGC said.

The floor price will be USD 1 per mmBtu higher than the domestic gas price (which currently is USD 8.57 per mmBtu).

The e-auction of ONGC gas will take place on March 2, it said.

CBM is an unconventional form of natural gas found in coal deposits or coal seams. Just like natural gas, it can be used to produce electricity and as feedstock for fertilisers, industrial uses such as in cement production, rolling mills, steel plants, and for methanol production. It can also be compressed into CNG for use as fuel in automobiles or piped to household kitchens for cooking.

While the government every six months fixes the price of natural gas produced from conventional fields, the pricing of gas from coal seams, called CBM, is free or market-determined.

The minimum price ONGC is seeking in the latest tender is less than what it had sought for CBM from a Bokaro block in Jharkhand last year. In June 2022, ONGC invited bids for the sale of 0.20 mmscmd at a reserve or floor price of 14 per cent of the Dated Brent crude oil price plus USD 1 per million British thermal unit, the sale tender had shown.

Bidders will have to quote a premium they are willing to offer over that reserve price.

The floor price was the government-mandated price for domestic natural gas plus a USD 1 per mmBtu mark-up.

The ""Contract Gas price shall be the higher of the 14 per cent of Dated Brent Price plus USD 1 per mmBtu plus 'P' (the biddable parameter); or the floor price,"" it had said.

At the current Brent crude oil price of USD 85 per barrel, the reserve gas price came to USD 12.9 per mmBtu in that tender.

In March last year, Reliance sold CBM gas from the Madhya Pradesh block at a big premium to firms, including GAIL, GSPC and Shell.

Reliance had sold 0.65 mmscmd of gas from block SP-(West)-CBM-2001/1 at a USD 8.28 premium over prevailing Brent crude oil prices. The firm had sought bids at a premium over the base of 13.2 per cent of Brent crude oil prices.

At the then Brent crude oil price of USD 115 per barrel, the base came to USD 15.18 per mmBtu and adding USD 8.28 premium bid by state-owned gas utility GAIL and other firms, the final price was USD 23.46 per mmBtu.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), is eying exploration and production assets in Africa and Latin America.

OVL signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with YPF SA of Argentia on the sidelines of the India Energy Week in Bengaluru, a company statement said.

""The MOU seeks to enhance cooperation between the two companies in the energy sector, including but not limited to cooperation in the areas of exploration and development of upstream oil and gas opportunities, promote investment and cooperation, and forging closer ties between research and training centres,"" it said.

YPF, Argentina's largest integrated energy company, is 51 per cent owned by the Argentine Government and 49 per cent listed in the New York and Buenos Aires stock exchanges.

It is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, being the largest shale operator outside of the United States of America, and is also involved in transportation, refining and marketing of natural gas and petroleum products.

OVL is India's flagship overseas oil firm. It currently has a stake in 32 oil and gas projects in 15 countries, spanning from Venezuela to Vietnam.

Its managing director Rajarshi Gupta speaking on the sidelines of the conference said the company is interested in exploration and production investment opportunities in countries like Ghana and Suriname.

""Bigger hot spots with larger discoveries"" are better options to invest, he said, citing huge hydrocarbon potential in Africa and Latin America.

He did not give details.

OVL's biggest investment is in Russia where it has invested in four different projects. Sakhalin-1, its main producing asset, is producing some 150,000 barrels per day after resumption of production under the management, he said adding the output should reach 200,000 bpd by June.

US supermajor ExxonMobil was the operator of Sakhalin-1 before it announced its exit from the project over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

EIL Chairman and Managing Director Vartika Shukla in an interview with Moneycontrol said that the company is well positioned for growth both in India and from the international market as well. “EIL is well poised to work on both of these angles, both in the conventional space as well as in the space of transition for tomorrow,” she said.

She said EIL has done the groundwork for future orders and expects a lot of projects it has bid to mature in the coming year. Edited excerpts:

The prime minister has talked about how India will be collaborating with international players to not only make energy affordable but also to move towards sustainability. EIL has been very active in the hydrocarbon space, how are you pivoting in that direction?

EIL is the core of the growth of the hydrocarbon sector in the nation. We have huge international footprints as well.

There are two things when we look at the prime minister's speech on decarbonisation; one there is a huge scope in the sector itself, to bring in technologies and innovation, and to reduce the carbon footprint in the conventional oil and gas space.

The second element is to bring up competency and capability to look at green technologies, whether they are biofuels or green hydrogen.

EIL is well poised to work on both these angles, in the conventional space as well as in the energy transition for tomorrow.

EIL has a significant presence in India and also does projects in the Middle East/West Asia. Given the crude price volatility in the last one year and its effect on global capital expenditure, how is EIL’s international pipeline is shaping up and how do the next 18 months look like?

Moving on from where we are positioned, we have had a lot of groundwork being done in the last year or so. We're not just well-positioned in India but also a global player. We have done a $20 billion refinery in Nigeria and are doing a $2 billion refinery in Mongolia.

We have a very good order book position with the ADNOC (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) group of companies. EIL is riding the investment cycle upwards, both in the domestic as well as overseas markets. We are very well-positioned with our Abu Dhabi office team which is working out of the Middle East region and are well poised in Africa.

We've got a new $22 million order in Guyana for a power plant and in times to come, I will be happy to share an order of about $40 million in another African country. In India, we see a large investment in refineries integrated with petrochemicals.

We're working with a lot of our clients who are looking at integrated petrochemical complexes.

We are also stepping into the electric vehicle space, where you have a large volume of the two-wheelers and three-wheelers going into EV space.

We have a lot of release of feedstock for petrochemicals and therein we see huge potential in petrochemicals.

We are currently executing the Barmer refinery on behalf of HRRL (HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Ltd) which is over 25 percent petrochemical intensity, one of the highest in the public sector.

It is very complex and it leads to a lot of competencies to be built both within the company and also with our stakeholders, partners and vendors, whom we very closely associate with

That's an excellent question. Moving on from where we are positioned and we have had a lot of groundwork being done in the last year or so.

We're not just well-positioned in India, but we are also a global player. Put in context, we have done a $20 billion refinery in Nigeria, we are doing a $2 billion refinery in Mongolia.

We have a very good order book position now with the ADNOC (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) group of companies.

And this is a cycle and EIL is riding that cycle, upwards in investments, both in the domestic market, as well as overseas.

We are very well-positioned with our Abu Dhabi office team who's working out of the Middle East region, very well poised in Africa.

We've got a new order of $22 million in Guyana for a power plant and in times to come, I will be happy to share an order of about $40 million in another African country.

In India, we see a large investment in the refinery, but integrated with petrochemicals.

We're working with a lot of our clients who are looking at integrated petrochemical complexes.

We are also the stepping in onto the electrical vehicle space, where you have a large volume of the two wheeler, three wheeler going into the EV space.

We have a lot of release of feedstock for petrochemicals and therein we see huge potential in petrochemicals.

We are currently executing the Barmer refinery on behalf of HRRL (HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Limited) which is over 25% petrochemical intensity, that's one of the highest in the public sector.

It is very complex and it leads a lot of competencies to be built in both within the company, and also with our stakeholders, our partners, our vendors whom we very closely associate with.

What is your total order book right now and what kind of growth are you expecting in the next 18 months?

Our order book has doubled in terms of new orders secured in comparison to the last year and we have a month-and-a-half to go. So we are very, very well-positioned in terms of the business growth that we are seeing.

We are very focused. Our business strategies are very clear and very well-defined, not only in the nation but in the international market also.

And we see a lot of turnaround happening, a lot of maturing of projects that we have bid for in this year as well as in the coming year.

(EIL’s order book as of December 2022 stood at Rs 7,865.6 crore, with 57 percent of it being consultancy projects and the rest turnkey projects, according to an investor presentation made by the company on February 4)

Would you like to give us some indication of what the growth could be like?

There are many things that are work in progress. If you see your number in the last nine months, we have done about 17 percent higher in terms of revenues. We have to build our margins this quarter.

Typically, the realisation happens in the last quarter when everybody closes their books.

So we see good year-on-year growth compared to the last financial year also, and the conversion of this order book into the actual realisation of revenue and the bottom line is likely to see results in the upcoming year.

If we look at the last quarterly result, the top line grew quite significantly, but there was a significant decline in the bottom line. What has happened here and if this is not really something that you're concerned about?

Absolutely, that's of no concern to us, not to say that we are not focused on that. We are very focused on our margins. We realise those numbers.

As I mentioned, the nine-month results are better than the year-on-year. With respect to the bottom lines, a lot of closure of financials happens by the end of the year.

So I think it would be mature to look at it at the end of the year, rather than kind of look in nine months.

The conversion of a lot of work into revenues takes place when we close the accounting books at the end of the financial year. Also, we have segmental revenue in the consultancy, which is very, very robust, as that has always been our niche, and in the LSTK (lump-sum turnkey) segment. And things are being worked out to bring up the revenue and margins in the LSTK segment.

All in all, I would say that by the end of the year, the results are going to bounce back when you compare 2021-22 to 2022-23.

Women are now the heads of top public sector undertakings, be ONGC, NHAI or EIL. Do you think the glass ceiling is finally breaking?

I have never believed there was a glass ceiling. It's always on your merit and your competency and the ability to see things in a leadership role.

What matters is what you position, the company and the portfolio you deal with in terms of business growth, in terms of business strategy and what value you bring to the table. And that I think is gender specific.

So I am, of course, fortunate to be here heading one of the most prestigious organisations in the world. Our teams are committed to the growth of the organisation and I'm committed to them to lead from the front to make sure that growth happens.",1507,0.8218969003013943

The board members have appointed Arun Kumar Singh as Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Accordingly, Singh is designated as Chairman & CEO of the company.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC's) delayed Krishna Godavari basin KG-D5 project is likely to start crude oil production in May this year and gas output a year later, a senior company official said.

ONGC was originally to start gas production from the Cluster-II fields in block KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) in June 2019 and the first oil was to flow in March 2020.

But these targets were shifted. The company blamed contracting and supply chains issues due to the pandemic for shifting the start of oil production first to November 2021, then to third quarter of 2022 and now to May 2023. Gas output start target was first revised to May 2021, then to May 2023 and now to May 2024.

Company's director (offshore) Pankaj Kumar said a floating production unit, called FPSO, which will be used to produce oil, is already in Indian waters. ""We estimate oil production should start in May,"" he said.

The block is currently producing 1.7 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) of natural gas.

""We will start with 10,000 to 12,000 barrels per day and reach the peak of 45,000 bpd in 2-3 months,"" he said, adding some 2 mmscmd of gas would also flow with oil but actual gas output will start in May 2024 when 7-8 mmscmd production is expected.

The production estimates are however much lower than what was originally projected.

At the time of its launch in April 2018, ONGC had said the estimated capital expenditure would be USD 5.07 billion and operational expenditure would be USD 5.12 billion over a field life of 16 years.

Kumar said the company hopes to arrest the decline in crude oil production in the next fiscal while natural gas output is likely to see a rise.

ONGC's KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries' KG-D6 block in the KG basin, has a number of discoveries that have been clubbed into clusters. It is situated offshore the Godavari river delta in the Bay of Bengal. It is located 35 kilometre off the coast of Andhra Pradesh in water depths ranging from 300-3,200 metres.

The discoveries in the block are divided into three clusters -- Cluster-1, 2 and 3. Cluster 2 is being put to production first.

Not just the delay but the production profile has also undergone a change since the investment decision was made.

The Cluster 2 field is divided into two blocks namely 2A and 2B, which as per the original investment decision were expected to produce 23.52 million metric tonnes of oil and 50.70 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas over the life of the field.

Cluster 2A was estimated to contain reserves of 94.26 million tonnes of crude oil and 21.75 bcm of associated gas, while Cluster 2B is estimated to host 51.98 bcm of gas reserves.

Cluster 2A was anticipated to produce 77,305 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and associated gas at a rate of 3.81 million metric standard cubic metres per day over 15 years. Cluster 2B is expected to produce free gas of 12.75 mmscmd from eight wells and has a 16-year life.

But now the output estimate is lower -- 45,000 bpd of oil and up to 2 mmscmd from Cluster 2A and 7-8 mmscmd from Cluster 2B.",581,-0.37164299190044403

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in fiscal 2021-22 produced 21.707 million tonne of crude oil, which is refined to produce petroleum products like petrol and diesel, and 21.68 billion cubic metre (bcm) of natural gas, which is used to produce electricity, manufacture fertiliser and as CNG in automobiles.

”We are definitely looking forward to increasing production of oil and gas in 2023-24 and even in the current year,” ONGC chairman Arun Kumar Singh told PTI.

In the current fiscal year (2022-23), crude oil production is slated to rise to 22.823 million tonnes and gas to 22.099 bcm. In the following fiscal year, oil production will climb to 24.636 million tonnes and 25.689 million tonnes in 2024-25.

Natural gas production is slated to rise to 25.685 bcm in 2023-24 and 27.529 bcm in the following year. ONGC, which contributes around 71 per cent to India’s domestic production, has reported a gradual decline in output for over a decade now primarily because its fields are old and ageing.

The government has considered giving away ONGC’s biggest oil and gas fields to private and foreign companies in an attempt to boost output but this has faced internal resistance. Singh said the company is open to partnerships in technical difficult fields.

ONGC is investing Rs 59,000 crore in 20 major projects, including in bringing to production oil and gas reserves found in deepsea KG block KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and the fourth phase redevelopment of mainstay Mumbai High fields.

While investment in KG-D5 will bring additional output, spending on the redevelopment of currently producing Mumbai High and other fields would help arrest the natural decline that has set in the ageing fields. The company will hook up a floating production system (FPSO) and subsea facilities soon.

The first oil from KG-D5 is expected in May 2023 and a peak output of 45,000 barrels per day of gas (2.25 million tonnes annually) and about 12 million standard cubic metres per day of gas will be in 2024-25.The block is likely to yield 1.935 million tonnes of oil and 2.784 bcm of gas in 2023-24.

Singh said ONGC will continue to invest around Rs 30,000 crore per year on capital expenditure, aimed at arresting the decline in output and subsequently increasing it. The capex spend will not be impacted by the levy of windfall profit tax on domestically produced crude oil.

The levy is triggered on any price over and above USD 75 per barrel, a rate good enough for ONGC to keep spending on finding and producing oil and gas in the coming years.

The firm has a little less than 600 hydrocarbon discoveries. Most of them were either in production or action had been initiated to monetise them. The roadmap for increasing output addresses monetisation plans of all the discoveries of ONGC, barring about 42 finds, which are isolated/far from existing infrastructure or have very low volumes or are located in difficult areas.",525,0.17716636260350546

More than a month after Arun Kumar Singh was appointed chairman of India's largest oil and gas producer ONGC, the retired BPCL head is also the CEO of the company now, according to a stock exchange filing by ONGC.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has been traditionally headed by a chairman and managing director. It, however, did not have a full-time head after Shashi Shanker superannuated on March 31, 2021.

The government on December 7 named Arun Kumar Singh, who had a couple of months back retired as head of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), as the chairman of ONGC but not as its managing director.

Now, he has been appointed the CEO of the company as well.

""In continuation of our communication dated December 7, 2022, regarding the appointment of Arun Kumar Singh as chairman of the company. It is informed that the Board at its meeting held on January 24, 2023, has appointed Singh as Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Accordingly, Singh is designated as Chairman & CEO of the company,"" ONGC said in a stock exchange filing.

Singh, 60, has been appointed for a three-year tenure with effect from the date of his assumption of charge of the post, according to a DoPT order. He took charge on December 7, 2022.

A mechanical engineer from the National Institute of Technology, Patna, Singh was Director (Marketing) of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) from October 2018 to September 2021, after which he was elevated as chairman and managing director of the company.

Singh retired as BPCL head 13 months later in October 2022 after attaining a superannuation age of 60 years.

This is perhaps the first instance of a retired executive being appointed as the head of a Maharatna PSU.

A search-cum-selection committee, constituted by the oil ministry, had zeroed in on Singh after interviewing six candidates on August 27, 2022.

Singh was already selected to head the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) before the August 27 interviews.

In his nearly 38 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, he has headed business units and entities in BPCL, such as retail, LPG, pipelines and supply chain optimisation.

He also held the position of President (Africa & Australasia) in Bharat PetroResources Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPCL, engaged in the exploration of oil and gas, largely overseas, according to information available on the BPCL website.",413,

The government of India while clearing the National Green Hydrogen mission on January 4 also earmarked incentives worth Rs 17,490 crore for its production and manufacturing of electrolysers.

But even as details of how these incentives will be rolled out are yet to be announced, a host of private sector conglomerates have already made pitches to go big on green hydrogen. Some of them announced their targets way back in 2021 when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman first revealed about India’s plan to harness green hydrogen in her 2021 budget speech and later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the National Hydrogen Energy Mission in his Independence Day speech in August the same year.

For starters, green hydrogen is produced using renewable energy through electrolysis and thus, is carbon free. In this process, hydrogen is separated from oxygen in the water through an electric current. Renewable sources, such as solar or wind, are used in the requirement for electricity for electrolysis and hence, the colour “green” is attributed to this form of hydrogen.

Moneycontrol takes a look at what companies have promised to accelerate India’s green hydrogen mission.

ADANI GROUP

On June 14, 2022, Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL) announced that it has partnered with France’s TotalEnergies SE to invest $50 billion over the next 10 years in India to produce green hydrogen and develop an ecosystem around it.

In the initial phase, ANIL aims to develop green hydrogen production capacity of 1 million ton per annum before 2030.

Last month (December, 2022), ANIL signed a development and licensing agreement with Cavendish Renewable Technology (CRT), a Melbourne based hydrogen technology firm, for development of alkaline electrolyses, polymer exchange membrane (PEMs), anion exchange membranes (AEMs) and CRT’s innovative “C-Cell” technology for mass scale production.

RELIANCE INDUSTRIES LTD (RIL)

On August 29, 2022, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries said the company aims to transition to green hydrogen production, from grey now, by 2025. The company aims to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen to under $1/kg by the end of this decade.

According to sources, RIL is in advanced talks with Hinduja-owned truck and bus maker Ashok Leyland for the development and supply chain of hydrogen-powered engines.

Bloomberg on January 5 reported that Mukesh Ambani will be focusing his attention on RIL’s pivot to green energy. The 65-year-old will oversee strategy, including the building of gigafactories and blue hydrogen facilities, will assess acquisition targets, and is talking to potential investors, the people said, asking not to be named as the information isn’t public.

Ambani last year unveiled plans to spend $75 billion on clean energy projects over the next 15 years.

INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LTD (IOCL)

IOCL is targeting to replace at least a tenth of its current fossil-fuel-based hydrogen at its refineries with green hydrogen as part of a decarbonisation drive. This year, the company is also going to set up subsidiary to house its green energy businesses.

“The company is venturing into green hydrogen production and is targeting 5 percent of hydrogen produced by it as green hydrogen by 2027-28 and 10 per cent by 2029-30,” the PSU’s 2022 annual report stated.

To start with, the nation's largest oil firm is setting up green hydrogen plants at its Panipat and Mathura refineries.

Besides, Chennai petroleum corporation, a subsidiary of IOCL, has recently issued an EOI for the design, manufacturing and commissioning f the electrolyser and related items for the production of green hydrogen at its refinery at Manali in Chennai.

ONGC

In July, 2022, India’s state-controlled Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and joint venture partner Greenko inked a pact to spend up to $6.2 billion on renewable energy and green hydrogen projects.

GREENKO-KEPPEL DEAL

In October, 2022, Greenko Group announced that India will for the first-time export green energy from 2025, with the first shipments going to a Singapore power plant as it signed a MoU with Singapore's Keppel Infrastructure.

Through the MoU, the two companies will explore opportunities in green hydrogen in India. They are working towards a 250,000 tonne per annum contract to be supplied to Keppel’s new 600Mw power plant in Singapore.

Greenko’s wide range of investments includes $5 billion in the storage of carbon-free green hydrogen energy across India

GAIL India Ltd

On May 12, 2022, GAIL announced that it has awarded a contract to set up one of the largest Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Electrolyser in India. The project would be installed at GAIL’s Vijaipur Complex, in Guna district of Madhya Pradesh, and would be based on renewable power. The project has been designed to produce around 4.3 MT of green hydrogen per day (approx. 10 MW capacity). It is scheduled to be commissioned by November 2023.

In January, 2022, GAIL had commenced India’s first-of-it’s-kind project of mixing hydrogen into natural gas system.

BHARAT PETROLEUM CORPORATION LTD (BPCL)

BPCL is going to install a 5 MW electrolyser system to set up a green hydrogen production facility in a phased manner in one of its city gas distribution projects. In June, 2022, it invited bids for the same.

In April 2022, BPCL signed a five-year Memorandum of Understanding with the Odisha government to explore the feasibility of setting up a renewable energy plant and a green hydrogen plant (both for domestic and export customers) among other things.

The company has collaborated with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) to work on alkaline electrolyser technology for Green Hydrogen production. It aims to scale up production of the electrolyser for commercial use, especially in refineries.

NTPC Ltd

India’s largest electricity producer, NTPC, plans to use about 5 GW capacity in green hydrogen and ammonia business out of its 60 GW green portfolio target by 2032.

NTPC has started three pilots on the hydrogen business. One is a pilot project of blending green hydrogen and natural gas at its Kawas plant in Gujarat. The second is in Leh where the company is setting up a green hydrogen filling station along with solar plants. The plan is to run hydrogen based fuel cell buses there as well. The third is a pilot project of producing hydrogen along with carbon capture at its Vindhyachal plant in Madhya Pradesh.

LARSEN & TOUBRO LTD (L&T)

Engineering major L&T commissioned a green hydrogen plant at its AM Naik Heavy Engineering Complex in Hazira, Gujarat in August 2022. The plant produces 45 Kg of green hydrogen on a daily basis, which is used for captive consumption in the company’s Hazira manufacturing complex.

The company has also signed an agreement with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay to jointly pursue research and development work in the green hydrogen value chain.

In January, 2022, L&T signed a pact with Norway-based electrolyser technology and manufacturer HydrogenPro AS to set up a unit in India. As per the memorandum of understanding, L&T and HydrogenPro will work towards setting up of a gigawatt-scale manufacturing unit for alkaline water electrolysers based on HydrogenPro technology.

In December 2021, L&T tied up with Nasdaq-listed ReNew Power to jointly develop, own, execute and operate green hydrogen projects in India.

HPCL

Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) aims to have a green hydrogen capacity of 24,000 tonnes a year, and hopes to commission a 370-tonne-a-year-capacity green hydrogen plant at its Vizag refinery.

State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is expected to see an uptick in production in 2023 with the commencement of projects including the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin and Sagar Samrat.

The oil giant recently announced that its offshore drilling rig ‘Sagar Samrat’ was commissioned as a Mobile Offshore Production Unit (MOPU) on 23 December 2022.

Analysts are upbeat about the performance of ONGC this year and expect the company’s production to rise. “Sagar Samrat is expected to add ~6,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) from WO-16, which is ~1-2 percent of ONGC’s existing oil production from domestic blocks. Much more important would be the developments in the KG basin, expected to add 10 percent of existing oil and 20 percent of existing gas production for ONGC,” Swarnendu Bhushan, Oil & Gas Analyst, Institutional Equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, told Moneycontrol.

The Sagar Samrat MOPU will handle up to 20,000 barrels per day of crude oil, with a maximum export gas capacity of 2.36 million cubic meters per day, ONGC said in a press release. The MOPU is also expected to add 6,000 bbls/day (barrels per day) of oil to ONGC’s production in the coming days, the company added.

Sagar Samrat, a jack-up rig, was converted into an MOPU and installed close to the WO-16 wellhead platform on 16 April 2022 for production, processing and transportation of oil and gas from the WO-16 Cluster. WO-16 is a cluster of four marginal fields in the Arabian Sea at a water depth of 75-80 m and 130 km from Mumbai which is about 40 km from Mumbai High.

KG basin to drive growth

With expectations of commencement of operations from ONGC’s much-delayed project in KG basin in Bay of Bengal, production growth of the oil giant is anticipated to rise in 2023.

“The decline in oil and gas production came in the backdrop of delays, especially in KG-DWN-98/2. However, with its completion standing at 76 percent as of October ’22, the visibility of first oil from KG-DWN98/2 and rise in gas production appear much stronger,” said brokerage firm Motilal Oswal in a report.

ONGC was initially expected to begin gas production from the Cluster-II fields of KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 project in June 2019, while oil production was anticipated to begin from March 2020. However, the company missed the deadlines. It blamed the coronavirus restrictions, engineering changes and project execution challenges.

“ONGC’s MoU targets (standalone, excluding JV share) of 21mt (+8 percent YoY) of oil and 24.3 bcm (billion cubic meters) of gas (+18 percent YoY) are ambitious and predicated on the commencement of KG 98/2 asset after two years+ of delays. With an estimated ~12 mmscmd (million metric standard cubic meters per day) of gas and ~40,000 b/d (barrels per day) of oil production expected by FY25E, the KG asset will account for ~2 mtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent) of oil and most of ~5 bcm/y gas output boost expected by FY25E,” said ICICI Securities in a note.

India’s crude oil production had fallen 2.67 percent in the fiscal year 2022 as ONGC missed production targets. In FY22, ONGC produced 19.45 million tonnes of crude oil, 13.82 percent lower than the target.

ONGC expects oil production to rise to 22.823 million tonnes and gas production to 22.099 bcm in the current fiscal year, the company’s management told investors in a call, reported PTI.

Analysts also expect the trend to be reversed in 2023 on account of production boost from KG basin.

“The much-awaited KG-DWN-98/2 is forecasted to reverse this trend from May ’23 by adding peak oil production of 40-45,000 bopd and peak gas production of ~10-12 mmscmd (both by FY25). At the peak, this field would add ~10 percent to ONGC’s domestic oil production and ~20 percent to its current domestic gas production,” said Motilal Oswal in a report.

Relief from Kirit Parikh recommendations

The recommendations of the Kirit Parikh Committee on natural gas pricing is expected to bring big relief to ONGC as it would incentivise the cost of production, the brokerage report said.

“The Kirit Parikh Committee recommendations of a price floor of $4/mmbtu and a cap of $6.5/mmbtu for APM gas, retaining premium for difficult fields and proposing a gradual movement to free pricing in three years (annual escalation of $0.5/mmbtu till then) is a material positive. ONGC has a production and development cost of only $3.5/mmbtu for most of its legacy fields and has seen an average blended realisation of only $3.7/mmbtu over FY15-22,” said ICICI Securities.

The Kirit Parikh Committee, which was set up by the government to review the pricing formula for gas produced in the country as global energy prices soared, has recommended complete liberalisation of natural gas prices by January 1, 2027.

The government-appointed panel also recommended a floor of $4 per mmbtu and a cap of $6.50/mmBtu for legacy and old fields operated by ONGC and Oil India Ltd.

Motilal Oswal retained its 'Buy' call on ONGC and picked the oil giant as the “top idea” for the current year in the sector.

“We recommend ONGC as the top idea for 2023 in the sector. Valuing the standalone business at 6x December ’24E EPS of Rs 28.2 and adding the value of investments of Rs 27, we arrive at our TP (target price) of Rs 198, implying 35 percent potential upside,” said Motilal Oswal.",918,0.38911885023117065

The net profit of operating central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) stood at Rs 1.65 lakh crore in the previous fiscal.

The Public Enterprises Survey 2021-22 also revealed that the net loss of loss-making CPSEs narrowed to Rs 0.15 lakh crore in FY 2021-22 from Rs 0.23 lakh crore in FY 2020-21, showing a decrease of 37.82 per cent.

Dividend declared by operating CPSEs in FY 2021-22 stood at Rs 1.15 lakh crore, as against Rs 0.73 lakh crore in FY21, up 57.58 per cent.

The survey attributed the revenue rise in FY 2021-22 to better performance by the petroleum (refinery and marketing), crude oil and transport, and logistics segments.

Among the sectors, manufacturing, processing and generation sector continues to command the highest share, followed by services, and mining and exploration.

Three cognate groups -- petroleum (refinery and marketing), trading and marketing, and power generation -- together contributed 69.08 per cent to the gross revenues in FY 2021-22.

The net profit of profit-making CPSEs stood at Rs 2.64 lakh crore in FY 2021-22 against Rs 1.89 lakh crore in the previous fiscal, up 39.85 per cent. The top five CPSEs with the highest net profits were ONGC, Indian Oil Corporation, Power Grid Corporation of India, NTPC and Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL), the survey said.

The contribution of all CPSEs to the central exchequer by way of excise duty, custom duty, GST, corporate tax, interest on central government loans, dividend, and other duties and taxes stood at Rs 5.07 lakh crore in FY 2021-22, as against Rs 4.97 lakh crore in FY 2020-21, showing an increase of 2.14 per cent.

The top five CPSEs contributing to the central exchequer were Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd and Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd.

While stressing on delays in project execution, the brokerage sees an upside owing to the firm's floor price: For 10 quarters, domestic APM gas price was

below USD3/mmBtu (NCV), roughly the cost of gas production for ONGC. For another eight quarters, ONGC barely made any money on its gas production with domestic gas prices being below USD3.5/mmBtu (NCV).

Motilal Oswal's research report on ONGC

The Great Conjunction is a rare conjunction of the naked-eye planets – Jupiter and Saturn. It is an event that roughly occurs every two decades when Jupiter overtakes Saturn in its orbit. As Mother Aughra in the 1982 cult classic – The Dark Crystal – says, “The Great Conjunction is the end of the world…or the beginning… sometimes good, sometimes bad”, the year 2023 is likely to be a defining year for ONGC with two prominent triggers. These are: a) a rise in domestic oil & gas production, and b) possible floor on gas realization. Both are likely to play out in favor of the company, an outcome that makes us pitch ONGC as the top idea for 2023 in the sector.



Outlook

ONGC trades at 3.3x FY24E consolidated EPS of INR44.2 and 2.2x consolidated EV/EBITDA. Considering the great conjunction in addition to the cushion provided by the high dividend yield of 13.6% in FY23, we retain our BUY rating on ONGC with a TP of INR198, making it the top idea for 2023 in the sector.

Andhra Pradesh State-Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) in a meeting held last month cleared two separate proposals put up by the ONGC for environmental clearance.

The Board of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is being revamped by merging two directorships into one and creating a new position of director for corporate affairs in an attempt to breathe fresh life into the state-owned behemoth that is increasingly looking beyond oil and gas, sources said.

ONGC Board presently has six directors for exploration, onshore operations, offshore operations, finance, human resources and technical and field services. It used to be headed by a chairman and managing director.

The government earlier this month appointed Arun Kumar Singh, who had recently retired as head of oil refining and fuel marketing company BPCL, as the chairman of ONGC but not as its managing director.

While this is the first instance of a 60-year-old retired person being appointed as the head of a bluechip state-owned firm, the government also initiated a board revamp.

A post of Director (Production) has been created after merging Director (Onshore), who is in charge of all oil and gas fields located on land, and Director (Offshore) who looks after all offshore assets such as the prime Mumbai High fields, two sources aware of the matter said. A new position of Director (Strategy & Corporate Affairs) has also been created.

The post of Director (Production) will come into effect from March 1, 2023 after Director (Onshore) Anurag Sharma superannuates on February 28, 2023. The job is likely to go to Pankaj Kumar, Director (Offshore).

The new Director (Strategy & Corporate Affairs) is likely to look after information technology, communication services, safety, occupational health, environment, business development, joint ventures and marketing after a rejig of workforce between the different functions happens, the sources said.

The jobs that the new position will handle are currently rotated among directors. For instance, marketing is with the Director (Onshore).

Sources said the idea behind the board revamp is to bring greater synergies in operations and allow focussed attention on oil and gas production with a single director responsible for all fields.

The new Director (Strategy & Corporate Affairs) will also ensure undivided focus on new businesses such as renewable energy forays, downstream activities like oil refining and petrochemicals and LNG, besides marketing of oil and gas at the best rates.

The revamp is on lines of the Organisation Transformation Project (OTP) suggested by consulting firm McKinsey.

Most of the present board-level positions were created in 2001 under a McKinsey OTP plan. McKinsey's OTP was initiated in 2000 by then ONGC chairman and managing director Bikash Bora and implemented despite resistance from within the company, by his successor (late) Subir Raha, who renamed OTP as the Corporate Rejuvenation Campaign (CRC).

In 2001, in line with McKinsey's recommendations, ONGC's Director – Personnel was renamed Director HR, the Director – Operations became Director – Offshore, Director – Technical became Director – Onshore while Director – Drilling became Director – Technology and Oilfield Services. The Exploration and Finance titles were unchanged.

The second phase of McKinsey's recommendations are being implemented now, sources said, adding the company management has been discussing the board-level revamp with the parent administrative ministry of petroleum and natural gas since mid-2021.

A position of Director (Research and Development) was also suggested but this has not been implemented yet.

ONGC had in March 1997 initiated a project for restructuring of the company in consultation with international management consultant McKinsey and Company Inc. The consultants submitted their recommendations on Organisation Transformation Project (OTP) of ONGC to its management in phases during the years 1997 to 1999.

The recommendations highlighted the need to have a greater focus on ONGC's core activities of finding and producing oil and gas, better management of skills and expertise in oil field services, greater commercial and performance accountability and quicker decision making by decentralisation.

McKinsey had called for the need for focussed attention on structural changes, and also changes in systems and procedures in the areas of exploration, reservoir management, drilling, material management, logistics, human resources, budgeting and costing, performance management systems, research and development institutes and information services.

In the first part of its report, McKinsey had suggested that ONGC should have focus on reserve accretion and increasing output, promote organisational and individual accountability and function with commercial goals uppermost in mind. It had identified four thrust areas — reserve accretion, commercial accountability, multi-disciplinary approaches and overseas opportunities essential for ONGC to maintain its dominant position in the Indian oil sector.

From a functional view, McKinsey had suggested that different departments operate in a cross-functional manner, pooling talent and expertise from other departments. ONGC in pre-2001 had four departments — drilling, operation/production, technical, and personal and accounts, which often led to fragmentation of efforts.

Besides Director (Onshore) Anurag Sharma and Director (Offshore) Pankaj Kumar, ONGC has Om Prakash Singh as Director (Technical and Field Services), Pomila Jaspal as Director (Finance) and Rajesh Kumar Srivastava as Director (Exploration).

The Director (HR) post is vacant and government-headhunter PESB has already advertised for the position.

Srivastava too is due to retire at month-end but the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) is yet to seek applications for the post.

PESB is also yet to advertise to replace Sharma, who took charge on June 1, 2020 and retires on February 28, 2023. This is in line with the decision not to continue with the post of onshore director.",970,0.9633395373821259

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd proposes to drill 53 exploratory wells in Andhra Pradesh- 50 in Godavari on-Land PML (Petroleum Mining Lease) Block of KG Basin and three in CD-ONHP-2020/1 (OALP-Vi) Block Of Cuddapah basin with an investment outlay of Rs 2,150 crore.

Andhra Pradesh State-Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) in a meeting held last month cleared two separate proposals put up by the ONGC for environmental clearance.

According to ONGC, it proposes to carry out the onshore exploration of 50 wells during 2021-'28 in Godavari on-land PML block of KG basin in East and West Godavari Districts of AP based on the geological and geophysical studies.

These wells will be converted to development wells and connected to the nearest Early Production System (EPS)/ Gas Collecting Station (GCS) if proved commercially viable, it further said.

""Total of Rs 2,000 crore (approximately Rs 40 crore for each well), ONGC said in case of KG basin exploratory wells.

ONGC proposes to carry out the prospecting and exploration drilling in the CD-ONHP-2020/1 block of Cuddapah basin falling in Kurnool, Anantapur and YSR Kadapa districts of AP, it said in another proposal adding based on the geological and geophysical studies the three exploratory locations are planned to be drilled during the period 2021-24.

The estimated project cost for the three wells would be Rs 150 crore and it would take three to five months for exploratory drilling at each well site, ONGC said.

""The Committee after examining the project proposals, presentations, MoEF&CC Notifications & OMs and detailed deliberations, recommended to issue environmental clearance with following additional conditions,"" the SEIAA said while giving its nod.

The proponent shall have the liability to pay compensation to the farmers and property holders in case of damages due to operation of wells, the committee said as one of the conditions.

ONGC currently produces 4.4 million standard cubic feet of gas and over 700 tonnes of oil from KG Basin per day.",340,

Arun Kumar Singh, former chairman of oil refining and marketing company BPCL, was on Wednesday appointed as chairman of ONGC -- the first instance of a retired person being appointed as the head of a Maharatna PSU.

The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) first intimated the decision of the Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Soon after, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas issued an order appointing Singh as chairman of ONGC for three years and wasting no time he took charge, holding the first video conference with board members from Mumbai.

The petroleum ministry in a statement said besides the appointment of Singh as chairman, board-level changes have been effected by the creation of a post of Director (Production) by merging the current posts of Director (Onshore) and Director (Offshore).

A post of Director (Strategy and Corporate Affairs) has been created. These two changes will be effective from March 1, 2023.

""The restructuring of the Board of ONGC has been approved in the context of emerging trends in the energy sector and national energy priorities,"" it said.

The medium and long-term strategic goals of ONGC require it to deliver in respect of enhanced production, increased exploration with an emphasis on technology and pace of implementation, partnership with reputed sectoral firms to leverage best in class technology, efficient and engaged management of JVs, the ministry said.

The revamped board, it said, is expected to ""play a pivotal role in these tasks and work towards realising synergies and ensuring enhanced collaboration within the organisation and also relevant external stakeholders.""

""The ACC has approved the proposal of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas for appointment of Arun Kumar Singh, ex-CMD, BPCL as Chairman, ONGC for a three-year tenure with effect from the date of his assumption of charge of the post,"" the DoPT order said.

PTI first reported of Singh's appointment on November 17. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is India's top oil and gas producer.

ONGC has been without a full-time head since April 2021. It was headed by a chairman and managing director but in case of Singh, 60, the order states he has been appointed as chairman.

It is unclear if the post is being split and a managing director would also be appointed.

In a stock exchange filing, ONGC said ""Singh has been appointed chairman of the company by Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas vide a letter dated December 7, 2022 for a period of three years with effect from the date of assumption of charge or until further orders, whichever is earlier."" ""Singh has assumed charge of the post of chairman on December 7, 2022,"" it added.

A mechanical engineer from National Institute of Technology, Patna, Singh was Director (Marketing) of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) from October 2018 to September 2021, after which he was elevated as chairman and managing director of the company.

Singh retired as BPCL head 13 months later in October 2022.

A search-cum-selection committee, constituted by the oil ministry, zeroed in on Singh after interviewing six candidates on August 27.

Singh was already selected to head the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) before the August 27 interviews.

In his nearly 38 years of experience in oil and gas industry, he has headed business units and entities in BPCL such as retail, LPG, pipelines and supply chain optimization.

He also held the position of President (Africa & Australasia) in Bharat PetroResources Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPCL, engaged in exploration of oil and gas, largely overseas, according to information available on BPCL website.

ONGC is without a regular chairman and managing director since April 2021 and the senior most director on the board has been entrusted with the additional charge. Since then, the firm has seen a record three interim heads.

Singh became eligible for consideration for the job after the oil ministry relaxed age-related criteria.

Eligibility criteria for a board-level position at the PSU provide an internal candidate (applicant from within the PSU) should not be more than 58 years of age on the date of the vacancy. The maximum age for external candidates is 57 years on the date of the vacancy.

The ministry changed it to state that any candidate to be eligible for consideration should not be more than 60 years of age on the date of occurrence of the vacancy, according to the ministry's office memorandum sent to DoPT on June 17. The vacancy arose on March 31, 2021.

This is the first ever instance of a retired person being appointed as a chairman of a Maharatna company.

None of the ONGC's existing directors or the acting chairpersons, who had become eligible for the job after the ministry relaxed the eligibility criteria, were considered fit for the position, sources said.",807,0.9975071251392365

The Kirit Parikh Committee, which recommended a floor and ceiling price for natural gas produced from legacy fields of state-owned producers to moderate input price for CNG and fertilizer, has favoured paying ONGC and OIL a premium of 20 per cent over such price for any new gas production they add from old fields.

The panel, which submitted its report to the oil ministry last week, has recommended benchmarking price of natural gas produced from ONGC and OIL’s legacy or old fields, called APM gas, at 10 per cent of cost of crude oil imported into India, according to a copy of the report seen by PTI.

This rate would however be subject to a ceiling or cap price of USD 6.5 per million British thermal unit, until a full deregulation of prices is implemented in 2027. There would also be a floor of USD 4 with a view to cover for cost of production and at the same time keeping cost for fertilizer, power and CNG, which use gas as input raw material, at manageable levels.

The basket of crude oil India imports averaged about USD 83 per barrel in December. Going by recommendation of the committee, the price for APM gas, which makes up for 60 per cent of all gas produced in the country, should be USD 8.3 per mmBtu (10 per cent of imported oil price).

But Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) will be paid only USD 6.5 in case the recommendation for ceiling and cap price of the committee is accepted by the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

APM gas is currently priced at USD 8.57 per mmBtu using a formula that uses weighted average rates in gas-surplus nations such as the US, Canada and Russia. For gas produced from fields in difficult geology such as deep sea or in high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP) zones, the panel was for continuing with existing formula without any floor.

Such fields are currently paid a ceiling price of USD 12.46 per mmBtu using a formula that is different from APM. Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner bp plc of UK are the biggest producer of gas from difficult fields.

The committee recommended fully de-regulating APM gas price by January 1, 2027, ”if the gas price volatility on the international market has moderated”. For difficult fields, the full pricing and marketing freedom should be given by January 1, 2026.

”To incentivise additional production from a new well or well intervention in the nomination blocks, the committee recommends a premium of 20 per cent over and above the APM prices for ONGC/OIL,” the report said. ”The government may consider giving marketing freedom for this additional production from new wells or well intervention in the APM fields.”

The modalities for this may be finalised by upstream regulator Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) and approved by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas within a period of three months, it said. APM gas is the one produced from fields given to ONGC and OIL on nomination basis without any provision of sharing profit. This gas totalled 49.26 million standard cubic metres per day in 2021-22.

A third of this gas was used for generating electricity, 22 per cent for converting into CNG to run automobiles and piping natural gas (PNG) to household kitchens for cooking purposes and 17 per cent for producing fertilizer.

The price of APM gas remained less than USD 3 till March this year but spiked in the following month as global energy rates rose in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This led to a 70 per cent rise in CNG and piped cooking gas price and constitution of the committee to ensure ”fair price to end consumers” while also ensuring ”market oriented, transparent and reliable pricing regimes for India’s long-term vision for ensuring a gas-based economy.”

”The benefit of decrease in APM prices should be passed on to the consumer,” the committee said, asking the government to ”maintain a portal for monitoring of consumer prices with detailed break up.” City gas operators selling CNG and piped natural gas should be asked to upload data on the portal, it said.

”This would lead to fair prices for the CNG and PNG customers.” The committee said every dollar decrease in gas price would result in Rs 1,915 crore cut in cost of production of power, Rs 1,014 crore cut in subsidy on fertilizer sector and Rs 2,115 crore reduction in cost of CNG and PNG on an annual basis. It would also lead to Rs 2,500 crore reduction in collection of government by way of taxes, royalty and dividends.

”In case of current production from APM fields of ONGC and OIL, the committee recommends that a dynamic ceiling and a fixed floor should be imposed on the prices of APM gas,” the report said.

”USD 6.5 per mmBtu should be set as the first ceiling of domestic gas price. This ceiling should be increased by USD 0.5 per mmBtu every year so as to slowly move towards the marketing and pricing freedom for APM fields also.”

To protect these firms from prices going below their marginal cost of production, the committee recommends that a fixed floor price of USD 4 per mmBtu should be set for the APM gas. ”This is also broadly the marginal cost of production of domestic gas from nomination block fields which are already very old.”

”The actual price of natural gas produced from nomination fields (APM gas) shall be a dynamic price fluctuating between the floor and ceiling based on the import price of Indian Crude Basket. The average price of the previous months, say from 26th of the previous month to 25th of current month may be taken as a basis and 10 per cent (average adjusted and weighted long term slope for RLNG contracts) of it as the APM price subject to the floor price of USD 4 per mmBtu and the dynamic ceiling price,” the report said, adding such a price may be notified by the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the oil ministry on the last date of a month.

City gas distribution companies stand to benefit the most if the recommendations of the Kirit Parikh committee on gas pricing are implemented, brokerages said.

The committee, which submitted its report on November 30, suggested a floor price of $4 per metric million British thermal units (mmBtu) and a cap of $6.50 per mmBtu for gas produced from legacy and old domestic fields. The cap will rise by 50 cents every year, according to the recommendations, and pricing will be deregulated from January 2027.

“If approved, CGD companies like IGL (Indraprastha Gas Ltd.) and MGL (Mahanagar Gas Ltd.) will benefit the most as priority sector accounts for over 80 percent of revenues. At a cap price of $6.5/mmBtu (currently $8.57), retail CNG (compressed natural gas) prices could be down Rs 7-8/kg,” Prabhudas Lilladher said in a report. “Margin expansion for CGDs will depend on the extent of passing on the benefit of lower gas prices.”

Pawan Kumar, commercial director of IGL, told CNBC-TV18 that if the panel’s recommendations are approved, it would be a welcome move.

“The recommendation is that the input gas cost of APM (administered pricing mechanism) gas should come down by around 24 percent. But if we see the RLNG (regasified LNG) and spot component also for IGL, the net reduction (in overall costs) will be around 18 percent,” Kumar said.

Global price rise

IGL and MGL provide CNG as auto fuel and piped natural gas (PNG) to commercial establishments and households.

Global natural gas prices have surged due to geopolitical tensions. Following the increase in global prices, the government hiked the price of gas by 40 percent to $8.57 per mmBtu for gas from old fields, which account for about two-thirds of all domestically produced gas.

“Capping of domestic gas price at $6.5/mmBtu, despite an annual increase in the ceiling by $0.5/mmBtu, is positive for the CGD sector in the near to medium term (particularly IGL and MGL, given higher dependency on domestic gas) as it is still lower than the current APM gas price of $8.57/mmBtu for 2HFY23. Hence, reduction in gas cost by ~$2/mmBtu could lead to reduction in CNG price by Rs 8-9/kg,” JM Financial said in a report. “CGD companies may partly pass this to end consumers to maintain competitiveness of CNG while partly may retain some benefit to support margins given the rising dependency on expensive spot LNG.”

According to the Kirit Parikh committee report, the cap and the floor on gas prices would be removed by January 1, 2027, and prices would be market-determined for gas currently under APM, which is set by the government.

“The floor and ceiling prices provide healthy gas realisation to upstream producers with graded increases over the next five years, moving to full decontrol from January 1, 2027,” said Prashant Vasisht, vice-president and co-head of corporate ratings at ICRA Ltd.

Brokerage Emkay said if the recommendations are implemented, it would provide respite to CGD players, with potential cuts in the retail selling price (RSP) and margins staying within the targeted range.

“IGL has taken a limited CNG RSP hike since October and, as per our estimates, current EBITDA/scm is at Rs 3-4. With lowering of APM to $6.5, IGL may be able to reduce Delhi CNG RSP by Rs 2/kg from the current Rs 78.6/kg and still recover margins to >Rs 7/scm,” Emkay said in a report.

Impact on gas producers

The recommendations would be neutral-to-positive for companies such as state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Oil India, which produce gas from oil fields, said brokerages.

“Recommendation on domestic APM gas price is neutral to positive for ONGC/Oil India in the medium term as we were factoring in net gas price realisation of $6.6/mmBtu in FY23 and $5.6/mmBtu in FY24. Unlike for the CGD sector, deregulation of domestic APM gas price from January 2027 onwards could be significantly positive for ONGC/Oil India in the long term,” said JM Financial. “Every rise in gas realisation by $0.5/mmBtu will raise ONGC/Oil India’s EPS by ~5 percent.”

The upstream companies would also benefit because the minimum price is still above production costs, said ICICI Securities.

“The report is positive for the upstream companies as well, given that the minimum floor is still above the production and development cost for ONGC and Oil India’s legacy fields and the price of $6.5 going to $8 in three years is well above historical averages for the two companies,” said Probal Sen, an analyst at ICICI Securities.

As global energy prices soared, the government set up the Kirit Parikh committee in September to review the pricing formula for gas produced in the country. The government will now deliberate on the report and consider converting it into policy.

“We have listened to all stakeholders and considered their concerns. And we have tried to balance them in the sense that we give all producers adequate returns, distributors adequate margin and consumer fair price. We didn’t want to increase any burden on the government,” energy expert and former Planning Commission (since renamed NITI Aayog) member Kirit Parikh told CNBC-TV18.

The government-appointed gas price review panel headed by Kirit Parikh on November 30 submitted its report recommending a floor of $4 per (Metric Million British Thermal Unit) and a cap of $6.50/mmBtu for legacy and old fields fields being operated by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL).

According to the report, by January 1, 2027, the cap and the floor would be removed and the prices would be market-determined for gas which is currently under Administered Pricing Mechanism (APM). The government will now deliberate on the report and consider converting it into policy.

For the gas from difficult fields such as those lying in deepsea or which are in high-pressure, high-temperature zones, the committee has suggested no tinkering with the existing mechanism of paying them higher rates based on a different formula to compensate for the greater risk and cost involved. These fields have by and large pricing freedom but are constrained by an upper cap that the government prescribes and updates from time to time. The Krishna Godaveri block D6 (KG-D6) fields of Reliance Industries Ltd and its joint venture partner bp plc are governed by the pricing formula for difficult fields that will remain unchanged for now. However, the report suggests that the upper cap should be removed from January 1, 2026.

“The whole idea to do all this is that we wanted to make sure that the government’s target of 15 percent of gas in the Indian economy by 2030 has a chance of fullfilment. That requires that we produce a lot of domestic gas. Currently only 6 percent of our total energy is from gas and we are importing 50 percent of gas,” Parikh told CNBC-TV18.

The committee’s recommended price band of $4-6.50/unit would be applicable for those legacy or old fields of ONGC and OIL -- where the cost has long been recovered and which are currently governed by a formula that uses rates in gas-surplus nations such as the US, Canada, and Russia.

In September, the government constituted the committee, led by energy expert and former Planning Commission (since renamed NITI Aayog) member Kirit Parikh, to review the gas pricing formula for gas produced in the country with the aim to ensure a fair price even as global prices for gas remained high.

“We have listened to all stakeholders and considered their concerns. And we have tried to balance them in the sense that we give all producers adequate returns, distributors adequate margin and consumer fair price. We didn’t want to increase any burden on the government,” said Parikh.

Gas from legacy fields is sold to city gas distributors who had to raise rates of CNG and piped cooking gas by over 70 per cent after prices went up from $2.90 per million British thermal unit till March to $6.10 in April and further to $8.57 last month, reflecting a surge in global rates. This rise in rates, which narrowed the gap between CNG and polluting diesel, had prompted the review.

This would ensure that explorers, who are seeing a surge in cost of services due to the spike in global energy rates, are not put at a disadvantage.

On October 1, prices of natural gas were increased 40 per cent as part of the government's six-monthly review of prices. The government sets the price of gas every six months, on April 1 and October 1, each year based on rates prevalent in gas-surplus nations such as the US, Canada and Russia in one year with a lag of one quarter.

The Kirit Parikh committee, which was set up by the government to review the gas pricing formula, is likely to submit its report on November 30 recommending a complete liberalization of natural gas prices by January 1, 2026, CNBC-TV18 reported on Nov 28 quoting sources.

In September, the government constituted the committee, led by energy expert and former Planning Commission (since renamed NITI Aayog) member Kirit Parikh, to review the gas pricing formula for gas produced in the country with the aim to ensure a fair price even as global prices for gas remained high.

The draft recommendation will be discussed by members of the committee and finalized on November 29.

On October 1, prices of natural gas were increased 40 percent as part of the government's six-monthly review of prices. The government sets the price of gas every six months, on April 1 and October 1, each year based on rates prevalent in gas-surplus nations such as the US, Canada and Russia in one year with a lag of one quarter.

What to expect?

According to media reports and brokerage reports, the key expectations from the committee’s report include the following:

1. The committee is likely to suggest a price cap for Administered Pricing Mechanism (APM) gas, including for ONGC Ltd and Oil India Ltd.

2. A committee is expected to propose a formula that helps reduce prices by about $2/mmBtu or so for the priority sector, which would result in price declining to $7/mmBtu from more than $9.2/mmBtu now. Priority sector includes city gas distribution, power and fertilizer sectors.

3. The committee is unlikely to suggest any changes in prices of gas from difficult gas fields. For instance, the Krishna Godaveri block D6 (KG-D6) fields of Reliance Industries Ltd and its joint venture partner bp plc are governed by the pricing formula for difficult fields and that is likely to remain unchanged.

4. The report may recommend an annual escalation of $0.5/mmbtu for the next few years.

5. The report may also recommend a gradual move to market pricing of gas in 3-4 years, a long standing demand of the industry.

How can it help?

India has a long-term vision to emerge as a gas-based economy aimed at increasing the use of cleaner fuel and curbing imported inflation. The biggest challenge remains that low production of gas in the domestic market and its vulnerability to international gas prices.

Russia’s attack on Ukraine and the subsequent disruptions in gas supplies has resulted in a global energy crisis with countries scrambling for gas. India, which thus far was struggling to procure natural gas, has been facing an oversupply of late as the steep increase in prices forced customers in India to cut down their procurement.

“Given the mandate to encourage investments in new gas assets, we would assume premium gas pricing would have some linkage with term LNG (liquified natural gas) prices and hence, this will remain lucrative for RIL and ONGC’s new gas production,” ICICI Securities said in a note last week. The brokerage added a disclaimer that it does not have access to the draft report.

The brokerage said that two successive measures to help the gas sector– the amendments to gas transmission tariffs and the draft recommendations– are a material relief to the gas sector which has seen the macros turn deeply unfavorable over the last six months or so.

City gas distribution companies witnessed a muted performance in the second quarter and the recommendations of the committee could provide a big relief.

Brokerage Sharekhan said in a report on Mahanagar Gas Ltd on November 14, “Accommodative government policies and likely cut in APM gas price (Kirit Parikh committee already set up to review domestic gas pricing formula) or capping of domestic gas price would improve volume growth visibility and support sustained margin recovery for CGDs. We expect MGL’s PAT (profit after tax) to clock 13% PAT CAGR over FY22-25E, along with healthy RoE/RoCE of 19%/24%.”

A government-appointed gas price review panel, led by Kirit Parikh, is likely to recommend price caps for natural gas produced from legacy fields of state-owned firms to help moderate CNG and piped cooking gas rates, while keeping the pricing formula for difficult fields unchanged.

The panel, which was tasked with suggesting a ""fair price to the end-consumer"" while ensuring ""market-oriented, transparent and reliable pricing regime for India's long-term vision for ensuring a gas-based economy"", may opt to suggest two different pricing regimes, officials said.

For the legacy or old fields of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) -- where the cost has long been recovered and which are currently governed by a formula that uses rates in gas-surplus nations such as the US, Canada and Russia -- the committee is likely to recommend a floor or minimum base price and cap or ceiling rates.

This would ensure that prices do not fall below cost of production, as they did last year, or do not spike to record levels as currently.

Gas from legacy fields is sold to city gas distributors who had to raise rates of CNG and piped cooking gas by over 70 per cent after prices went up from USD 2.90 per million British thermal unit till March to USD 6.10 in April and further to USD 8.57 last month, reflecting a surge in global rates.

This way the concerns over investments in exploration and production (E&P) being hit would also be addressed, they said, adding that market-driven pricing would also encourage new investments and attract global players.

KG-D6 fields of Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner bp plc of UK are governed by the pricing formula for difficult fields. Rates for difficult fields from October 1 is USD 12.46 per mmBtu.

The panel headed by former planning commission member Kirit S Parikh is in the final stages of finalising its report. It would be submitted to the government in the next few days, the officials said, adding the cap for the legacy fields is likely to be higher than USD 4.75 per mmBtu cost of production and the floor could be set at USD 3.50.

The oil ministry will process the recommendations before moving the Cabinet for approval for changes in the existing gas pricing regime.

Natural gas is a fossil energy source that is formed deep beneath the earth's surface. It is used to generate electricity, produce fertiliser and petrochemicals, converted into CNG to run automobiles and piped to household kitchens for cooking and heating. It is also used in making glass, steel, cement, bricks, ceramics, tile, paper, food products, and many other commodities as a heat source.

Its prices remained docile till March 2022 but have shot up in recent months, raising the cost of production of user industries in general and city gas operators that sell CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households, in particular.

To keep rates under check so that they do not add fire to the already high inflation, the government formed a committee to review the way prices of gas produced in India are fixed.

The panel includes representatives of the gas producers association as also state-owned producers ONGC and OIL, a member from private city gas operators, state gas utility GAIL, a representative of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and a member from the fertiliser ministry.

In the panel meetings, the producers insisted on complete market freedom as had been guaranteed in the contracts they signed for finding and producing the fuel, while consumers wanted a ""fair price"", officials said.

Producers argue that artificially controlling prices would dry up investments in exploration. Consumers, particularly the city gas sector, felt that the environment-friendly fuel would lose out to other hydrocarbon fuels if the prices were not reasonable, they said.

The panel is of the view that an attempt has to be made to see that investments in exploration are not dissuaded. At the same time, the momentum that the city gas sector has got should not be disturbed.

The Modi government had in 2014 used prices in gas surplus countries to arrive at a formula for locally produced gas. Rates, according to this, are set every six months -- on April 1 and October 1 -- each year based on prices prevalent in gas surplus nations such as the US, Canada and Russia in one year with a lag of one quarter.

The rates according to this formula were subdued and at times lower than the cost of production till March 2022, but rose sharply thereafter, reflecting the surge in global rates in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The price of gas from old fields, which are predominantly of state-owned producers like ONGC and Oil India Ltd, was more than doubled to USD 6.1 per mmBtu from April 1, and to USD 8.57 9 per mmBtu from October 1.

Similarly, the rates paid for gas from difficult fields such as deep sea KG-D6 went up to USD 9.92 per mmBtu from April 1 against USD 6.13 per mmBtu. They rose to USD 12.46 per mmBtu last month.

Officials said the panel recommendations will aid in meeting the government target of more than doubling the share of natural gas in the primary energy basket to 15 per cent by 2030 from the current 6.7 per cent.",995,0.016212821006774902

India's largest oil and gas producer ONGC will this year reverse years of decline in production and gradually raise output thereafter as it invests billions of dollars to produce from newer discoveries, company's management told investors in a call.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in fiscal year 2021-22 produced 21.707 million tonne of crude oil, which is refined to produce petroleum products like petrol and diesel, and 21.68 billion cubic meter (bcm) of natural gas, which is used to produce electricity, manufacture fertilizer and as CNG in automobiles.

In current fiscal year (2022-23), crude oil production is slated to rise to 22.823 million tonne and gas to 22.099 bcm. In the following fiscal year, oil production will climb to 24.636 million tonne and to 25.689 million tonne in 2024-25, the management told investors in a call post announcement of second quarter earnings last week.

Natural gas production is slated to rise to 25.685 bcm in 2023-24 and to 27.529 bcm in the following year.

""We have reversed the declining trend,"" ONGC Director (Finance) Pomila Jaspal said.

ONGC, which contributes around 71 per cent to India's domestic production, has reported a gradual decline in output for over a decade now primarily because its fields are old and ageing.

The government has considered giving away ONGC's biggest oil and gas fields to private and foreign companies in an attempt to boost output but this has faced internal resistance.

ONGC is now investing Rs 59,000 crore in 20 major projects, including in bringing to production oil and gas reserves found in deepsea KG block KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and fourth phase redevelopment of mainstay Mumbai High fields.

While investment in KG-D5 will bring additional output, spending in redevelopment of currently producing Mumbai High and other fields would help arrest the natural decline that has set in the ageing fields.

Officials assisting Jaspal at the investor call stated that the company will hook up a floating production system (FPSO) and subsea facilities during the fair weather window starting in January.

First oil from KG-D5 is expected in May 2023 and peak output of 45,000 barrels per day of gas (2.25 million tonne annually) and about 12 million standard cubic meters per day of gas will be in 2024-25.

The block is likely to yield 1.935 million tonne of oil and 2.784 bcm of gas in 2023-24. Jaspal said ONGC will continue to invest around Rs 30,000 crore per year on capital expenditure aimed at arresting the decline in output and subsequently increasing it.

""Our capital expenditure has been in the range of Rs 30,000 crore (per year), which we have been maintaining,"" she said.

The firm has a little less than 600 hydrocarbon discoveries. Most of them were either in production or action had been initiated to monetise them.

The roadmap for increasing output addresses monetisation plans of all the discoveries of ONGC, barring about 42 finds which are isolated/far from existing infrastructure, or have very low volumes or are located in difficult areas.",504,0.26470709840456647

Oil refining and marketing company BPCL's former chairman Arun Kumar Singh is likely to be the new chairman of India's top oil and gas producer ONGC -- the first instance of a top PSU board-level position going to a person aged over 60.

A search-cum-selection committee, constituted by the oil ministry, zeroed in on Singh after interviewing six candidates on August 27, two sources aware of the matter said.

Singh retired after attaining the superannuation age last month and was already selected to head the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) before the August 27 interviews.

If his selection is approved, Singh will get three years as head of the cash-rich PSU (Public Sector Unit).

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is without a regular chairman and managing director since April 2021 and the senior most director on the board has been entrusted with the additional charge. Since then, the firm has seen a record three interim heads.

Sources said Singh became eligible for consideration for the job after the oil ministry relaxed age-related criteria.

Eligibility criteria for a board-level position at PSU provide for an internal candidate (applicant from within the PSU) should not be more than 58 years of age on the date of the vacancy. This eligibility for external candidates is the maximum age of 57 years on the date of the vacancy.

The ministry changed it to state that any candidate to be eligible for consideration should not be more than 60 years of age on the date of occurrence of the vacancy, according to the ministry's office memorandum sent to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on June 17. The vacancy arose on March 31, 2021.

This made Singh as well as Mukesh Kumar Surana, who superannuated as chairman and managing director of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) on April 30 this year, and Subhash Kumar, who retired as acting chairman of ONGC on December 31, 2021, eligible.

But strangely neither Surana nor Kumar figured in the shortlist of the candidates drawn by the search-cum-selection panel.

The relaxation in age limit also made all existing directors of ONGC eligible but again not all of them were called for interviews and neither was anyone from Oil India Ltd -- the other PSU oil explorer in the country.

Sources said questions were raised when the ministry first forwarded the selection made by the search committee for vetting by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), which makes all top appointments in the government.

The ministry was asked to provide for the advertisement that was issued to call for applicants, the vigilance clearance of the shortlisted candidate and the approval for raising the age limit.

It wasn't known how the ministry replied to those queries as no advertisement was issued.

The ministry did not reply to an email sent for comments.

Sources said vigilance clearance has now been sought for Singh and after that, his name would go to the ACC headed by Prime Minister for vetting.

Besides Singh, five candidates, including Engineers India Ltd chairman Vartika Shukla, had appeared for an interview before a search-cum-selection committee on August 27.

The panel had called nine candidates, including ONGC's then-acting chairman Alka Mittal and Indian Oil Corporation's (IOC) head S M Vaidya, for interviews.

Mittal and Vaidya chose not to appear for the interview, they said.

Others who appeared for the interview included ONGC directors Pankaj Kumar and Rajesh Kumar Srivastava. Srivastava is currently the acting chairman and managing director of ONGC.

Two of the three external candidates called for the interview appeared before the panel, they said.

The panel shortlisted nine candidates on the basis of the higher eligibility age limit proposed by the oil ministry, which brought most existing directors, who otherwise were ineligible to even apply, in the zone of consideration, they said.

Those shortlisted included Mittal and Srivastava, who is due to retire at the end of the year.

Strangely, the panel initially ignored ONGC's other three directors -- Director (Onshore) Anurag Sharma, Director (T&FS) O P Singh, and Director (Finance) Pomila Jaspal, as also anyone from the other state-owned oil and gas producer, Oil India Ltd (OIL).

However, a day before the interview, they were called to appear but all of them choose not to go, sources said.

Pankaj Kumar and Om Prakash Singh were the only directors from ONGC, who were eligible for consideration of the top post going by the existing rules.

The ministry also proposed an appointment for a period of three years from the date of joining instead of the present five-year term, according to the letter.

The three-member search-cum-selection committee was headed by the PESB chairman and composed of oil secretary and former Indian Oil chairman B Ashok (outside expert).

Most board-level appointments at public sector companies are done on the basis of recommendations of the Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB) but the government headhunter in June last year did not find anyone suitable among nine candidates, including two serving IAS officers, to head ONGC.

""Keeping in view the strategic importance and vision for the company and its future, the board did not recommend any candidate and decided to constitute a search committee,"" the ministry letter said referring to PESB's interviews on June 5, 2021.

The panel was constituted after eight months of that recommendation on February 4.",906,

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday dedicated to the nation Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited's U-field onshore facilities at Odalarevu in B R Ambedkar Konaseema district of Andhra Pradesh.

The project was dedicated to the nation along with the inauguration/foundation-stone laying of various other development projects worth over Rs 10,700 crore in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, a company statement said.

U-field is situated in Krishna Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/2 in Bay of Bengal. Natural gas from the field will be brought to the onshore facility through undersea pipelines before being dispatched to users.

ONGC, however, did not say when production from this field will start.

The U-field is part of ONGC's flagship deep-water KG-DWN-98/2 Cluster-II development project in the prolific Krishna Godavari Basin. U-field is the deepest gas discovery of the project, with gas production potential of about 3 million standard cubic metres of gas per day.

""The first well of the U field – U-3-B is one of the fastest deep-water well monetized globally in a record time of 11 months,"" the statement said. ""The gas from these wells is evacuated through the subsea facilities connected to an Onshore Terminal at Odalarevu."" ONGC said the subsea structures for this project are being fabricated for the first time in the country at Kattupalli Yard in Chennai, a capability which proved a boon for development of the domestic exploration and production (E&P) ecosystem with extensive skill development.

U-field monetisation involves a capex of Rs 2,917 crore. ""Gas produced from this project will add significant volumes to ONGC's production and will be a giant leap towards making India a gas-based economy and energy security,"" it said.",276,0.8943044245243073

Tirupati's world famous Lord Venkateswara temple's net worth of over Rs 2.5 lakh crore (about $30 billion) is more than the market capitalisation of IT services firm Wipro, food and beverage company Nestle and state-owned oil giants ONGC and IOC.

Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, keeper of the temple dedicated to Tirupati's presiding deity, for the first time since its founding in 1933 declared its net worth.

Its assets include 10.25 tonnes of gold deposits in banks, 2.5 tonnes of gold jewellery, about Rs 16,000 crore of deposits in banks, and 960 properties across India. All these total to over Rs 2.5 lakh crore. At current trading price, the networth of Tirupati temple is more than several blue-chip Indian firms, according to stock exchange data.

Bengaluru-based Wipro had a market cap of Rs 2.14 lakh crore at close of trading on Friday, while UltraTech Cement had a market value of Rs 1.99 lakh crore.

Swiss multinational food and drink major Nestle's India unit, with a market cap of Rs 1.96 lakh crore, too was valued below it.

State-owned oil behemoths Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) too were valued less than the temple trust and so was power giant NTPC Ltd, auto makers Mahindra and Mahindra and Tata Motors, world's largest coal producer Coal India Ltd, mining conglomerate Vedanta, real estate firm DLF and several others.

Only about two dozen companies have market valuation larger than the temple trust's networth. These include billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (Rs 17.53 lakh crore), Tata Consultancy Services (Rs 11.76 lakh crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 8.34 lakh crore), Infosys (Rs 6.37 lakh crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 6.31 lakh crore), Hindustan Unilever Ltd (Rs 5.92 lakh crore), State Bank of India (Rs 5.29 lakh crore), Bharti Airtel (Rs 4.54 lakh crore) and ITC (Rs 4.38 lakh crore).

Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) is growing richer and richer as the cash and gold offerings made by devotees at the hill temple continue to rise and fixed deposits in banks are also generating more income in view of increase in interest rates, a temple official said.

The assets owned by TTD include land parcels, buildings, cash and gold deposits in the banks, given as offerings to the temple by devotees.

Assigning a value to priceless antique jewellery and properties including cottages and guest houses on the seven hills to provide amenities to devotees could be misleading and hence does not form part of the estimated general asset value, temple officials said.

The sprawling seven hills are held sacred by devotees and are revered as the abode of Lord Venkateswara. In its about Rs 3,100 crore annual budget for 2022-23 presented in February, the TTD has projected over Rs 668 crore as income in the form of interests from cash deposits in banks. Also, Rs 1,000 crore income was predicted in the form of cash offerings alone — by about 2.5 crore devotees — in the hundi of the hill temple.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), is making a proposal to retake 20 per cent stake in Russia's Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in the far east, sources said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month disbanded Exxon Neftegaz - a regional subsidiary of US supermajor ExxonMobil - as operator of the Sakhalin-1 and transferred the project and all of its assets and equipment to a new operator.

The other former foreign shareholders in the project - Japan's Sodeco consortium and ONGC Videsh - have to apply to the Russian government to regain their shareholdings in the project.

OVL is in the process of applying to regain the 20 per cent stake it held in the project, three sources aware of the matter said.

""We want to retain the shareholding and will do all that the local law requires us to do,"" a source said. Sakhalin-1 is OVL's cash cow and without the project, the company will be a loss-making entity, another source said.

Production from Sakhalin-1 stopped in May after Exxon Neftegaz declared force majeure at the project in response to international sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in February.

Since then, OVL is facing cash issues, the source said.

OVL has stakes in 33 oil and gas assets in 15 countries, most of these being exploration assets. Sakhalin-1 is one of the oldest investments of OVL, where it has recovered all the money sunk in and was enjoying dividends. Sakhalin-1 is a large oil and gas field in far-east offshore Russia, spread over 1,140 square kilometers, which includes three offshore fields namely Chayvo, Odoptu and ArkutunDagi.

OVL acquired a 20 per cent stake in the project in July 2001.

Sakhalin-1 was producing 220,000 barrels per day of oil before the Ukraine war. Of this OVL's share was 44,000 bpd or 2.2 million tonnes per annum. Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL) and Sodeco held a 30 per cent stake each.

The remaining 20 per cent is held by Russia's Rosneft through its subsidiaries SMNG (11.5 per cent) and RN Astra (8.5 per cent). Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL) and Sodeco held a 30 per cent stake each.

Sources said Russian authorities have incorporated a new operator - also named Sakhalin-1 - as a limited liability company with a foundation capital of just 10,000 rubles (USD 160). The new entity is managed by Rosneft subsidiary Sakhalinmorneftegaz-shelf (SMNG).

ENL will now have two weeks to transfer its assets, financial obligations, personnel and existing contracts to the new operator while the foreign partners have to apply to take stakes of similar size in the new operator within a period of one month.

Almost all of Sakhalin-1's oil production is shipped to international markets via the De-Kastri terminal, located in the Khabarovsk region on the Russian mainland, which is linked to Sakhalin-1 via a dedicated pipeline.

Russia, they said, is keen to restart production before the upcoming winter to avoid potential damage to idle pipeline infrastructure.",517,-0.9998538792133331

The Nifty50 snapped a three-week losing streak and gained more than 1 percent to settle above 17,300 as well as 50 DEMA (days exponential moving average) of 17,275 in the week ended October 7, backed by buying across sectors barring FMCG.

The 50-share NSE benchmark has formed a decent bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly scale following a hammer pattern formation in the previous week, confirming the bullish bias. Now the index needs to hold on to 17,200, the immediate support level, as above the same level, 17,400 is expected to be immediate hurdle followed by 17,500, experts said. The crucial support remains at psychological 17,000 mark.

The index settled the last week with more than 200 points losses at 17,315, while there was outperformance in broader space as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 2.4 percent and 2.6 percent respectively.

""Since Nifty has managed to surpass 17,200 and is maintaining its position above this, 17,200 – 17,000 now becomes a sacrosanct zone for the market. Additionally, we can now observe yet another technical indicator i.e. positive crossover in daily ‘RSI-Smoothened’ is likely to provide a helping hand for bulls,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One said.

He further said, ""If the global market supports, we being the stronger market is likely to continue in the upward direction.""

As far as levels are concerned, 17,400 - 17,500 - 17,650 are to be seen as immediate hurdles for the Nifty50.

Sameet Chavan advises traders to remain sanguine and better to keep focusing on stock-specific moves.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the October 7 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Phoenix Mills: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,451.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,350 | Target: Rs 1,600 | Return: 10 percent

It has been consolidating between the rectangle trading range of Rs 1,450 and Rs 1,300 for the past two months. However, the volume indicator was only supporting the formation when it was about to break above the upside barrier of the range.

On Friday, the stock closed above the level of Rs 1,450. It is a bullish break-out formation for the stock and will help the stock to rally towards Rs 1,600 in the near term.

Buying is advisable at current levels and on declines up to Rs 1,400. One can place a stop-loss at Rs 1,350 for the same.

Poonawalla Fincorp: Buy | LTP: Rs 330.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 315 | Target: Rs 370 | Return: 12 percent

Since the stock has fallen to Rs 280 levels, it is slowly moving upwards. On Friday, the stock managed to close above the level of Rs 330, where it has a major resistance.

However, looking at the OBV (on-balance volume), we think it will cross Rs 330 and Rs 345 levels without any major effort.

It is in buy mode and would cross all major hurdles in the medium term. The strategy should be to buy between Rs 330 and Rs 320. Place a stop-loss at Rs 314 for a target of Rs 370.

Zomato: Buy | LTP: Rs 69.55 | Stop-loss: Rs 64 | Target: Rs 90 | Return: 29 percent

The stock made a remarkable comeback from the low of Rs 42. The positive divergence worked and supported the stock to move higher. On Friday, it crossed another level of resistance at Rs 69, which would send the stock to Rs 90 levels with a major hurdle at Rs 80.

Major oscillators are supporting the overall bullish formation of the stock. We are expecting a further upside in the stock from the current levels. It is a buy between Rs 70 and Rs 67. Place a stop-loss at Rs 64 for a target of Rs 90.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Jubilant Ingrevia: Buy | LTP: Rs 545.85 | Stop-Loss:Rs 512 | Target: Rs 578-600 | Return: 6-10 percent

The stock has consolidated within a narrow range in last few weeks. In the last few days, the stock witnessed buying interest as the volumes increased gradually and prices have now given a breakout from the falling trendline resistance.

The ‘RSI Smoothed’ oscillator is hinting at a positive momentum and hence, we expect the stock to continue its upmove in the near term.

Traders can buy the stock around current market price of Rs 545 and look to add on dips around Rs 525 for potential short term targets of Rs 578 and Rs 600.

The stop loss on short positions should be placed below Rs 512.

ONGC: Buy | LTP: Rs 134 | Stop-Loss: Rs 124 | Target: Rs 150 | Return: 12 percent

The stock has seen a decent correction from the highs in last couple of months as the crude Oil prices have cooled off from their highs. However, the prices are now showing signs of some pullback move as it has given a breakout from a trendline resistance.

The RSI oscillator has also given a positive crossover indicating a buying momentum.

Hence, traders can buy the stock in the range of Rs 134-132 for potential short term target of Rs 150. The stop-loss on positions should be placed below Rs 124.

Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivatives Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

Tata Chemicals: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,181.80 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,032 | Target: Rs 1,450 | Return: 23 percent

The stock bounced back after testing its prior point of polarity (placed at around Rs 1,050) and poised for a fresh up-move. The stock has potential to explore uncharted territory, which could lead it towards its 61.8 percent and 100 percent Fibonacci extension levels of prior up-move (Rs 773-1,194), which are placed at Rs 1,290 and Rs 1,450, respectively.

Its key moving averages are sloping upwards on long-term as well as medium-term timeframe charts and the key technical indicators are also positively poised.

In case of any decline, the stock will continue to find support around its prior point of polarity. A stable move below that point will invalidate desired action in the stock.

Tata Communications: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,217.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,096 | Target: Rs 1,520 | Return: 25 percent

The stock rose to four-and-half-month high of Rs 1,284 post a trendline breakout. After a higher level of reversal, the stock formed a base around its prior point of polarity (placed at around Rs 1,125) and bounced subsequently.

This could take the stock towards its highest level of April 2022 (Rs 1,401) initially and medium-term multiple tops (Rs 1,520) subsequently.

The stock is positively poised on the key moving averages on the short-term timeframe chart and its key technical indicators are also in favour of the bulls. On the lower side, the stock will continue to find support around its prior point of polarity. A convincing move below that point will negate possible up-move in the stock.

Shree Cements: Buy | LTP: Rs 21,284 | Stop-Loss: Rs 20,500 | Target: Rs 24,200 | Return: 14 percent

After a higher level of reversal, the stock formed a base around its 61.8 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of up-move (Rs 17,865-25,550) and poised for a breakout. This could lead the stock towards Rs 22,900-23,745-24,200 in the short-term.

The key technical indicators gave buy signal post bullish divergence.

At current juncture, the stock is providing better risk reward for desired action. In case of any decline, the stock will continue to find support around its 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of prior up-move.

A stable move below that level will invalidate probable rise in the stock.

ONGC led oil drillers and refineries on a demand wave on October 3 after crude oil prices climbed and the government slashed windfall tax on production and diesel exports.

ONGC, India's largest oil marketing company, was trading up 4 percent around 12.50pm.

Oil prices in the international market jumped more than 3 percent in early Asian trade on Monday, as OPEC+, which is a group of oil producing nations, weighed output cuts by more than 1 million barrels a day for its biggest reduction since the pandemic, in a bid to support the market.

Brent crude futures rebounded $2.51, or 3 percent, to $87.65 a barrel by 0206 GMT, after settling down 0.6 percent on Friday. US West Texas Intermediate crude was also up 3 percent, or $2.39, at $81.88 a barrel, after the previous session's loss of 2.1 percent.

India on Sunday slashed the windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil to Rs 8,000 per tonne from Rs 10,500 in the face of the prevailing downslide in global oil prices. It also scrapped the export tax on jet fuel and halved export duties on diesel to Rs 5 a litre.

The developments mean higher revenue for upstream as well as downstream companies.

ONGC, which drills oil well, was up over 5 percent at Rs 133.50, Oil India was up 3 percent at 179, while Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and Reliance Industries were trading in green with up to 1 percent gains.

Chennai Petroleum and Mangalore Refinery were up 3 percent and 6 percent.

The momentum was also because prices of natural gas were hiked by a steep 40 percent to record levels, in step with global firming up of energy rates. Natural gas is used to generate electricity, make fertilisers and is converted into CNG to run automobiles. Hence, all companies involving in these sectors are set to feel the cost pressure.

Oil stocks came under pressure recently because of falling crude oil prices and relatively higher taxes compared to last year.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp has for the first time sold oil through a three-month local tender, commanding $5-$8 per barrel more than existing rates under new rules that allow producers marketing freedom, industry sources said.

ONGC, the country's top oil explorer, accepted bids at that level through auction of light sweet oil from its western offshore field, including supplies from the country's flagship Mumbai High fields, they said.

In June India abolished a rule that said oil from blocks awarded prior to 1999 must be sold to government-nominated customers, mostly state refiners. That meant producers such as ONGC and Oil India often sold oil from those blocks at below market rates.

ONGC had offered 33 lots of 412,500 barrels each - 26 cargoes from Uran and seven cargoes from Mumbai offshore - for sale starting Nov. 1 at minimum 50-cent premium over the average monthly price of Brent, according to a tender document seen by Reuters.

Western offshore assets, including the Mumbai High fields, account for about 70% of ONGC's annual output of nearly 20 million tonnes, or roughly 400,000 bpd.

All the cargoes were sold to state refiners except one, which was awarded to Reliance Industries Ltd, sources said.

State refiner Hindustan Petroleum bought 15 cargoes; Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals bought five; and Bharat Petroleum Corp was the highest bidder for three, the sources said.

Indian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, got one cargo while its subsidiary Chennai Petroleum Crop was awarded eight, the sources said.

Indian refiners bid to pay a premium of $1.80-$1.85 per barrel for cargoes from Uran, where supplies come through a pipeline, $3.8-$6.5 per barrel for offshore cargoes and about $1.55 per barrel for a parcel from Panna Mukta field, they said.

Uran cargoes fetch a lower premium as local levies make the crude costlier than offshore supplies.

Sources said ONGC hopes to get better participation in subsequent tenders.

None of the companies involved responded to Reuters' requests for comments.

Iran has offered ONGC Videsh Ltd and its partners a 30 per cent interest in development of the Farzad-B gas field in the Persian Gulf that was discovered by the Indian consortium, officials said.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), in 2008 had discovered a giant gas field in the 3,500 square kilometer Farsi offshore block.

In April 2011, it submitted a master development plan (MDP) to bring the discovery, which was named Farzad-B, for production but negotiations got stalled as international sanctions were slapped on Iran over its nuclear plans. Negotiations restarted in 2015, but in February 2020, National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) informed that Iranian government has decided to award the contract to develop the field to a local firm.

The exploration contract, under which OVL and its partners had discovered gas reserves in Farsi block, provided for the discoverer to be part of the field development, the officials said. Citing the Exploration Service Contract, Iran asked the Indian consortium to exercise its rights to participate in the development contract up to minimum 30 per cent stake, they said, adding Tehran asked the Indian firms to exercise the right within 90 days failing which it would be deemed as rejection of the offer.

Officials said for further discussion to participate in the development contract, communications and comments on Confidentiality Agreement (CA) were sent to NIOC in March and a reminder in the following month. However, NIOC has not responded to that, they said.

OVL holds a 40 per cent stake in the 3,500 square kilometre Farsi offshore exploration block in the Persian Gulf of Iran. Indian Oil Corp (IOC) holds 40 per cent stake and the remaining 20 per cent is with Oil India Ltd (OIL). The Exploration Service Contract (ESC) for the Block was signed on December 25, 2002 and OVL in 2008 made a giant discovery on the block, which was later rechristened as Farzad-B.

The field holds 23 trillion cubic feet of in-place gas reserves, of which about 60 per cent is recoverable. It also holds gas condensates of about 5,000 barrels per billion cubic feet of gas. The Indian consortium submitted a Master Development Plan (MDP) of Farzad-B gas field in April 2011 to Iranian Offshore Oil Company (IOOC), the then designated authority by NIOC for the development of Farzad-B gas field.

A Development Service Contract (DSC) of the Farzad-B gas field was negotiated till November 2012, but could not be finalized due to difficult terms and international sanctions on Iran. In April 2015, negotiations restarted with Iranian authorities to develop the Farzad-B gas field under a new Iran Petroleum Contract (IPC). This time, NIOC introduced Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC) as its representative for negotiations.

From April 2016, both sides negotiated to develop the Farzad-B gas field under an integrated contract covering upstream and downstream, including monetization/marketing of the processed gas. However, negotiations remained inconclusive. In 2016, Iran said it was examining the Indian proposal but that an agreement was unlikely because of the difference between Iran's demanded gas price and India's offer.

India offered a USD 6.2 billion development plan and a gas price of around USD 4 per million British thermal unit for Farzad-B in 2018. Meanwhile, on the basis of new studies, a revised Provisional Master Development Plan (PMDP) was submitted to POGC in March 2017, officials said, adding that in April 2019, NIOC proposed development of the gas field under the DSC and offtake of raw gas by NIOC at landfall point.

However, due to the imposition of US sanctions on Iran in November 2018, technical studies could not be concluded which is a precursor for commercial negotiations. In February, 2020, NIOC informed its intention to conclude the contract for Farzad-B development with an Iranian company. In March 2021, it notified the Indian consortium of signing of the development contract with Petropars, a local Iranian company.

The Indian consortium has so far invested around USD 85 million in the block. The contract provides for the Indian consortium being paid back the expense together with a fixed rate of return.",691,

Prices of natural gas, which is used to generate electricity, make fertiliser and is converted into CNG to run automobiles, is likely to rise to record levels at the rate review scheduled this week, sources said. The government-dictated price for natural gas produced in the country is to be revised on October 1.

After factoring in the spike in energy prices witnessed in recent months, the rate paid for gas produced from old fields such as of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is likely to rise to USD 9 per million British thermal units from current USD 6.1. Simultaneously, difficult fields like the ones in Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner bp plc operated D6 block in KG basin, are likely to get around USD 12 mmBtu compared to the current rate of USD 9.92, two sources aware of the matter said.

These are the highest rates for administered/regulated fields (like ONGC's Bassein field off the Mumbai coast) and free-market areas (such as the KG basin). Also, this will be the third increase in rates since April 2019, and comes on the back of firming benchmark international prices.

The government sets the price of gas every six months — on April 1 and October 1 — each year based on rates prevalent in gas surplus nations such as the US, Canada and Russia in one year with a lag of one quarter. So, the price for October 1 to March 31, is based on the average price from July 2021 to June 2022. This is the period when global rates shot through the roof. So, the price for October 1 to March 31, is based on the average price from July 2021 to June 2022.

""The government has set up a committee to review the formula for pricing of domestically produced natural gas. It can for all practical reasons not revise prices on October 1, citing the pendency of issues before the committee,"" a source said. The committee, under former planning commission member Kirit S Parikh, has been asked to suggest a ""fair price to the end-consumer"", according to an order of the oil ministry.

The panel, which includes representatives of the gas producers association as also producers ONGC and OIL, was asked to submit its report by the month-end but the same is likely to be delayed, sources said. It also has a member from private city gas operators, state gas utility GAIL, a representative of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and a member from the fertiliser ministry, the order said.

The government had in 2014 used prices in gas surplus countries to arrive at a formula for locally produced gas. The rates according to this formula were subdued and at times lower than the cost of production till March 2022 but rose sharply thereafter, reflecting the surge in global rates in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The price of gas from old fields, which are predominantly of state-owned producers like ONGC and Oil India Ltd, was more than doubled to USD 6.1 per mmBtu from April 1, and is now expected to cross USD 9 per mmBtu next month. Similarly, the rates paid for gas from difficult fields such as deepsea KG-D6 of Reliance, went up to USD 9.92 per mmBtu from April 1 against USD 6.13 per mmBtu. They are expected to rise to USD 12 per mmBtu next month.

Gas is an input for making fertiliser as well as power. It is also converted into CNG and piped to household kitchens and a rise in its prices fuels inflation. The panel has been asked to recommend a fair price to end-consumers and also suggest a ""market-oriented, transparent and reliable pricing regime for India's long-term vision for ensuring a gas-based economy,"" the order said.

The government wants to more than double the share of natural gas in the primary energy basket to 15 per cent by 2030 from the current 6.7 per cent. The volume-weighted average of the price prevalent in a 12-month period in US-based Henry Hub, Canada-based Alberta gas, UK-based NBP and Russia gas are used to fix prices for administered fields of ONGC and Oil India Ltd.

For difficult fields like discoveries in deepwater, ultra-deepwater and high pressure-high temperature areas, a slightly modified formula is used by incorporating the price of LNG, which too had shot through the roof in 2021. Reliance-bp operated KG fields are classified as difficult fields. Reliance-bp operated KG fields are classified as difficult fields.

The sources said the increase in gas price is likely to result in a rise in CNG and piped cooking gas rates in cities, such as Delhi and Mumbai. It will also lead to a rise in the cost of generating electricity but consumers may not feel any major pinch as the share of power produced from gas is very low.

Similarly, the cost of producing fertiliser will also go up but as the government subsidises the crop nutrient, an increase in rates is unlikely.",835,0.16084493398666383

India's top oil and gas producer ONGC wants the government to scrap windfall profit tax levied on domestically produced crude oil and instead use the dividend route to tap into bumper earnings resulting from surge in global energy prices.

The firm also favours a floor price for natural gas at USD 10 per million British thermal unit -- the current government-dictated rate -- to help bring deposits in challenging areas to production, two sources aware of the matter said.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) management during discussions with government officials stated that levying windfall profit tax on domestic oil producers, while at the same time reaping rich savings from buying discounted oil from Russia was unfair.

Buying discounted Russian crude oil, which was shunned by the West since the Ukraine conflict, has helped save Rs 35,000 crore and this savings should be ploughed back by boosting domestic output, they said.

ONGC management has told the government the savings from Russian oil buy should be allowed to be passed on to the company which will invest the same in identified projects.

It feels companies should be allowed to reap higher revenues and profits from elevated oil and gas prices instead of levying windfall profit tax on prices above a threshold.

This higher profit can be then tapped for dividends which are a more equitable way of distributing wealth, the company management told the government.

As per the extant guidelines, ONGC pays a minimum annual dividend of 30 per cent of net profit or 5 per cent of the net worth, whichever is higher.

Following this policy, the firm will pay a higher dividend to the government, which holds almost 59 per cent shares in the firm, as well as other investors, boosting their confidence in the company. This would boost company share price and valuation, benefiting the government the most.

This route will also allow the company to retain a fair amount of money for spending on finding oil and gas in unexplored areas and bringing even smaller resources to production which will ultimately help the nation cut down on its imports, sources said.

India first imposed windfall profit tax on July 1, joining a growing number of nations that tax super normal profits of energy companies. Export duties of Rs 6 per litre (USD 12 per barrel) were levied on petrol and aviation turbine fuel and Rs 13 a litre (USD 26 a barrel) on diesel. A Rs 23,250 per tonne (USD 40 per barrel) windfall profit tax on domestic crude production was also levied.

The duties were partially adjusted in the five rounds on July 20, August 2, August 19, September 1 and September 16, and were removed for petrol exports.

Tax on domestically produced crude oil currently is Rs 10,500 per tonne while export duty on diesel is Rs 10 a litre and that on ATF is Rs 5.

Sources said ONGC believes that allowing free market pricing of oil and gas will help attract big companies with technical knowhow and financial muscles.

An ad-hoc tax adds to fiscal uncertainties for investors, they said.

Following the similar principle, the government should also allow companies to discover market price for natural gas and tax only gains accruing over and above a minimum USD 10 per mmBtu threshold.

While crude oil is priced at parity with international rates, the government currently fixes the price of natural gas bi-annually based on rates prevailing in gas-surplus nations like the US and Russia. Even this gas price fixation is now being reviewed with a view to bring down the rates for consumers.

The cost of producing gas from deepsea and difficult areas such as high-pressure, high-temperature fields is very high and any attempt to artificially control rates would lead to investments in such fields becoming economically unviable, they said.

ONGC has told the government that it recently discovered a price of USD 22 per mmBtu that users were willing to pay for its coal-bed methane (CBM) gas. The government could look to tax any price that accrues over and above USD 10, sources said.

The government-dictated gas price for ONGC's legacy fields is USD 6.1 per mmBtu for the six-month period ending September 30. The rate is close to USD 10 per mmBtu for difficult fields such as deepsea. These rates are expected to climb to over USD 9 per mmBtu and USD 12 respectively from October 1.",742,0.306901474793752

Through the last 16 sessions, the Nifty has been trading in the range of 17,200 - 18,000 and formed a Bearish Shark pattern with a reversal zone of 17,900-18,000.

Based on the movement of the index, two scenarios are possible in the coming weeks. One, if the Nifty closes above 18,000 on a weekly ,scale then we may see 18,500 in a couple of weeks' time which will negate our bearish shark pattern. Two, if the Nifty closes below 17,500 on a weekly scale, then we may see 17,000 in couple of weeks' time.

Thus, we believe that hedging would be the best weapon to use in the current market situation.

Since the last couple of weeks, we saw 2,500 points have been pumped in Bank Nifty and it closed near 40,400 mark. At current juncture, we are just 1,400 points away from the all-time high of 41,830 approximately, which was registered on October 25, 2021. Sustainability above 39,800 might take Bank Nifty to all-time high in coming weeks.

The above view would be negated below the 39,000 mark on a weekly closing basis.

Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

Pfizer: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,324 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,100 | Target: Rs 4,800 | Return: 11 percent

Since September 2021, the counter observed free fall from Rs 6,175 till Rs 4,070 and it has stabilized near its historical support of Rs 4,100. From candlesticks pattern perspective, during August 2022 month, the counter has displayed a pair of Dojis followed by bullish Engulfing pattern along with volume steadily increasing which is hinting upside.

From indicator perspective, weekly RSI (relative strength index) has a complex structure near the oversold zone which further confirms upside in counter.

One can buy in small tranches at current levels and buy another tranche at around Rs 4,250 levels. The upside target is expected till Rs 4,800 and with a stop-loss of Rs 4,100.

Gujarat Gas: Buy | LTP: Rs 507.2 | Stop-Loss: Rs 475 | Target: Rs 575 | Return: 13 percent

Gujarat Gas has corrected almost 49 percent from its peak of Rs 780 which was registered on August 2, 2021. On a weekly scale, it has taken support near Rs 420-430 levels.

Recently on a weekly scale, the stock confirmed a bullish Inverted Hammer candlestick pattern followed by a bullish Piercing pattern exactly at the mentioned support levels and that is adding more confirmation of further upside in the counter.

In addition to the above discussed technical reasoning, weekly RSI has displayed impulsive structure near the oversold zone which is adding more strength in the said counter. Thus we advise traders to buy the stock for an upside target of Rs 575 with a stop-loss of Rs 475.

ONGC: Buy | LTP: Rs 134 | Stop-Loss: Rs 120 | Target: Rs 150 | Return: 12 percent

ONGC has been making lower highs and lower lows since March 2022 which resulted in 38 percent correction. At current juncture, it has made a nice base near its historical support of Rs 130 levels as some buying resumed during the last couple of months along with volume activity increasing.

From indicator perspective, daily RSI (relative strength index) has bounced back after taking support near 40 levels which further confirms upside in counter. One can buy at current levels for an upside target expected till Rs 150 and with a stop-loss of Rs 120.

Shares of Indian fuel exporters were down up to 3 percent on September 1 after the government nearly doubled the so-called windfall tax on exports of diesel and raised the levy on aviation fuel, a move that is expected to dent the profitability of these companies.

ONGC dropped 2.2 percent, Reliance Industries Ltd was down 1.5 percent, Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd 3.3 percent, Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals 1.5 percent and Oil India lost 0.5 percent In the morning trade.

Oil marketing companies, however, were trading higher. HPCL and BPCL gained 1 percent.

""We believe specific duties (albeit expected) amid commodity volatility are a dampener as downside risks are unprotected, though the government said it would review this move every fortnight. Capping export gains, in addition to the domestic price freeze, is also a negative signal,” Emkay Research has said in its latest report.

The government's decision to impose windfall taxes on fuel export will offset excise duty cuts on domestic prices of petrol and diesel and help lower the budget gap in the current fiscal year, analysts said. This will also help in easing the risk of higher than budgeted borrowings.

The government has hiked the windfall profit tax on the export of diesel to Rs 13.5 a litre from Rs 7 and on jet fuel exports to Rs 9 a litre, besides raising the levy on domestically-produced crude oil in line with the hardening of global prices.

The tax on Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) exports was raised to Rs 9 from Rs 2 per litre with effect from September 1, a finance ministry notification issued late August 31 said. The tax on domestically-produced crude oil has been increased to Rs 13,300 a tonne from Rs 13,000.

The tax on exports has been raised as margins rose, while the levy on domestically-produced oil was increased marginally on changes in international oil prices and on expectations of a price rise on a possible production cut by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies.

An oil ministry order said Srivastava, who is Director (Exploration) of ONGC, has been entrusted with an additional charge of chairman and managing director ""for a period of 4 months with effect from September 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022 (i.e the date of his superannuation) or till the appointment of a regular incumbent to the post, or until further orders, whichever is the earliest.""

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is without a regular chairman and managing director since April 2021. Subhash Kumar, the then senior-most director on the company board and the director for finance, was named officiating head after Shashi Shanker superannuated on March 31, 2021.

Last week, six candidates, including Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd chairman Arun Kumar Singh and Engineers India Ltd head Vartika Shukla on Saturday appeared for an interview before a search-cum-selection committee that is looking for a new head for India's top oil and gas producer ONGC.

Six candidates, including Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd chairman Arun Kumar Singh and Engineers India Ltd head Vartika Shukla on Saturday appeared for an interview before a search-cum-selection committee that is looking for a new head for India's top oil and gas producer ONGC, sources said.

The panel had called nine candidates, including ONGC's outgoing chairman Alka Mittal and Indian Oil Corporation's (IOC) head S M Vaidya for interviews, three sources with knowledge of the matter said. Mittal and Vaidya chose not to appear for the interview, they said.

Prominent among those who appeared were Singh, who is due to retire from the top Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) job at end of October and who has already been selected to head regulatory body Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), and Engineers India Ltd (EIL) chairman and managing director Vartika Shukla. Others who appeared for the interview included Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) directors Pankaj Kumar and Rajesh Kumar Srivastava.

Two of the three external candidates called for the interview appeared before the panel, they said. The choice of the selection committee was not immediately known and the appointment will take at least 2-3 months as the candidate selected will have to be cleared by anti-corruption bodies like CBI and CVC before the name is put up to the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) for final vetting and approval.

For now, ONGC will next week get a record third interim chairman. ONGC is without a regular chairman and managing director since April 2021. Subhash Kumar, the senior-most director on the company board and the director for finance, was named officiating head after Shashi Shanker superannuated on March 31, 2021. And when Kumar retired on December 31, 2021, Alka Mittal, Director for Human Resources, was given additional charge. ONGC is without a regular chairman and managing director since April 2021. Subhash Kumar, the senior-most director on the company board and the director for finance, was named officiating head after Shashi Shanker superannuated on March 31, 2021.

Mittal is due to superannuate at month end and unless she is given an extension, the next senior most director - Rajesh Kumar Srivastava, Director (Exploration), is likely to be named as interim head, sources said. A search-cum-selection committee, which was in February this year tasked to identify suitable candidates, began work only this month after terms of reference were finalised.

The panel has shortlisted nine candidates on the basis of the higher eligibility age limit proposed by the oil ministry, which brought most existing directors - who otherwise were ineligible to even apply, in the zone of consideration, they said. The shortlisted included Mittal and Srivastava, who is due to retire at the end of the year.

Strangely, the panel ignored ONGC's other two directors - Anurag Sharma and O P Singh, as also anyone from the other state-owned oil and gas producer, Oil India Ltd (OIL). It called Vaidya and Singh but not the chairman of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL). Neither did it call any of the directors such as Subhash Kumar who had become eligible for the post because of the relaxed eligibility. It called Vaidya and Singh but not the chairman of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL).

The ministry proposed that any candidate to be eligible for consideration should not be more than 60 years of age on the date of occurrence of the vacancy, according to the ministry's office memorandum sent to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on June 17.

Prior to this change, the minimum age prescribed for being eligible for the top job is 45 years. Besides, internal candidates needed to have two years of residual service as on the date of vacancy and three years for external candidates. What the ministry proposed was that any eligible candidate who is not more than 60 years of age at the time of occurrence of vacancy which was April 1, 2021, should be considered eligible. This essentially meant that the current acting chairman, Alka Mittal, who otherwise would retire in August-end and was ineligible, had come under the zone of consideration. What the ministry proposed was that any eligible candidate who is not more than 60 years of age at the time of occurrence of vacancy which was April 1, 2021, should be considered eligible.

Also, Srivastava, who retires on December 31, and Sharma, who superannuates on February 28 next year, had become eligible. Previously, only Pankaj Kumar and Om Prakash Singh were eligible.

The ministry also proposed an appointment for a period of three years from the date of joining instead of the present five-year term, according to the letter. The selection will be done through a three-member search-cum-selection committee headed by the PESB chairman and composed of oil secretary and former Indian Oil chairman B Ashok (outside expert).

The panel was formed on February 4, 2022, but the terms of reference are being framed recently. Most board-level appointments at public sector companies are done on the basis of recommendations of the Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB) but the government headhunter in June last year did not find anyone suitable among nine candidates, including two serving IAS officers, to head ONGC.

""Keeping in view the strategic importance and vision for the company and its future, the board did not recommend any candidate and decided to constitute a search committee,"" the ministry letter said referring to PESB's interviews on June 5, 2021. The panel was constituted after eight months of that recommendation on February 4.",921,

The firm sought bids for the sale of 0.75 million standard cubic meters per day of gas for one year from the KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) fields in the Bay of Bengal, according to the tender document.

The firm asked users to quote a premium they are willing to pay over and above the reserve gas price of 14 per cent of Brent crude oil price plus USD 1 per million British thermal unit. The reserve price at the current ruling Brent oil price of USD 101 per barrel comes to more than USD 15 per mmBtu.

The applicable sale price shall be lower than the gas price bid or the government-dictated ceiling rate for gas produced from deepsea fields, it said. The government fixes the price of domestically produced natural gas twice a year - the rate for gas from deepsea fields for six months beginning April 1 is USD 9.92 per mmBtu.

This rate is expected to be revised upwards in October, reflecting a surge in international energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ONGC had in April last year sought bids for the sale of 2 mmscmd of gas from the KG-D5 block but had to abort the sale after the move was challenged in the court.

That tender was for the sale of 2 mmscmd of gas for a duration of 3 to 5 years at Odalarevu in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, which is connected to state gas utility GAIL's KG basin pipeline network as well as PIL's East-West Pipeline which is connected to KG basin network and further to Gujarat gas grid. In that tender, bidders were required to quote a premium over 10.5 per cent of Brent.

Last year, Reliance Industries and its partner BP Plc of UK sold 5.5 mmscmd of additional natural gas from KG-D6, which sits next to ONGC's KG-D5, at a rate linked to Platts JKM (Japan Korea marker) - the liquefied natural gas (LNG) benchmark price assessment for spot physical cargoes. This is the same benchmark RIL-BP had used in February to sell out 7.5 mmscmd of gas from the block.

ONGC's KG-D5 block is expected to have a peak production rate of 15.25 mmscmd of natural gas and 80,000 barrels per day of oil. The company is likely to come out with another tender later this year for the sale of 5 mmscmd of gas from next year.",438,-0.6483950614929199

The Supreme Court on Friday sought a response from the Centre to an appeal by Vedanta Ltd against a Delhi High Court verdict which said the government can demand 10 per cent higher share in the profit from the oil produced from the Barmer oilfield for extending the production sharing contract (PSC) with the private firm for another 10 years.

A division bench of the high court had in its March 26, 2021 verdict, set aside the single judge order which had directed the Centre to extend till 2030 its PSC with Vedanta Ltd and ONGC to produce oil from the oilfield in Rajasthan.

A bench comprising Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justice Krishna Murari took note of the brief submissions of senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Vedanta Ltd, and issued notices to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Director General of Hydrocarbons and the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Ltd.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, accepted the notice and sought four weeks for filing the response. The bench took note of the submissions and fixed the appeal of Vedanta and co-appellant Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Ltd for hearing in September.

Earlier, the Centre had moved an appeal before a division bench of the high court against the judgement of a single judge bench directing it to extend till 2030 its PSC with Vedanta Ltd and ONGC to produce oil from the Barmer oilfield. The Centre's appeal was allowed by the division bench of the high court against Vedanta which moved the apex court against it.

The division bench of high court had said the Centre can demand 10 per cent higher share in the profit derived from oil produced by Vedanta from the Barmer oilfield to extend the production sharing contract (PSC) with the company for another 10 years.

It had said no embargo can be placed on the right of the government to extend the contract on terms which are at variance with the initial terms of the PSC ""so long as they are in public interest and subserve the purpose of maximising revenue generation"".

The high court had also said that Vedanta does not have the right to demand extension of the PSC on unilateral terms that suit its interest, overlooking the interest of the State, which is a trustee of the natural resources under a Constitutional mandate.

Prior to this, the single judge bench of the high court had held that Vedanta was entitled to extension of its contract, which was to expire in 2020, for a further period of 10 years on the same terms and agreements when it was first entered into in 1995.

Initially, Vedanta had moved the high court after its request to the government in 2009 to extend the PSC did not elicit any response. It had claimed that the delay by the government in making a decision was preventing it from infusing further investment of over Rs 30,000 crore in the project.

In its plea before the single judge, Vedanta had said the estimated recoverable assets in the block were about 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, of which 466 million barrels are expected to be recovered beyond current PSC period until 2030.

Besides, it was also producing natural gas from the block and supplying it to government companies, the Anil Agarwal- promoted firm had claimed.",572,0.33272941907246906

India's top oil and gas producer ONGC on Friday reported a tripling of net profit in the June quarter as it earned record prices before the government slapped a tax on windfall profits arising from a global rally in energy rates.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC) standalone net profit at Rs 15,205.85 crore, or Rs 12.09 per share, in April-June, compared to Rs 4,334.75 crore, or Rs 3.45 a share, in the same period a year back, according to a stock exchange filing by the company.

Sequentially, the profit was higher than the Rs 8,859.54 crore net profit of January-March. The earnings rose as the company got USD 108.54 per barrel price for crude oil it sold in the quarter as opposed to USD 65.59 a barrel rate realised in the same period last year. Gas price realisation more than doubled to USD 6.1 per million British thermal unit from USD 1.79.

International energy prices have been elevated since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, raising concerns about global shortages given the nation's role as a key commodities supplier, especially to Europe.

West Texas Intermediate crude, the US oil benchmark, spiked to a high of USD 130.50 per barrel in March, while International benchmark Brent crude came within striking distance of USD 140. It was each contract's highest level since 2008.

The basket of crude oil that India imports averaged about USD 110 per barrel in the April-June quarter. The rally prompted the government to slap a Rs 23,250 per tonne (USD 40 per barrel) windfall profit tax on domestically produced crude oil from July 1.

The rate was reduced in subsequent reviews as global oil prices tumbled.

Oil prices have tumbled below USD 100 a barrel this month as recession fears grow, sparking fears that an economic slowdown will cut demand for petroleum products.

Windfall profit tax on domestic crude oil is currently at USD 17,750 per tonne and this will trim earnings of ONGC as well as other domestic crude oil producers like Oil India Ltd and Vedanta Ltd in the current quarter that began in July.

ONGC said turnover rose to Rs 42,320.72 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal year that began on April 1 from Rs 23,021.64 crore in the same period of last year.

The earnings were also aided by a 2 per cent rise in crude oil production at 5.5 million tonnes and a 1.4 per cent rise in gas output at 5.38 billion cubic meters.

Later in a statement, ONGC said it made two gas discoveries during the current fiscal. A gas find was made in a block in West Bengal and another in a block in Andhra Pradesh.

For the full 2021-22 fiscal (April 2021 to March 2022), ONGC had posted a net profit of Rs 40,306 crore on a turnover of Rs 1.1 lakh crore. In that year, it had got an average price of USD 76.62 per barrel and a gas rate of USD 2.35 per mmBtu.",517,0.038940198719501495

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on Wednesday signed a Heads of Agreement (HoA) with global oil giant ExxonMobil Corp for exploration of oil and gas in the deepsea on the country's east and west coasts.

The two oil explorers would focus on the Krishna Godavari and Cauvery basins in the eastern offshore and the Kutch-Mumbai region in the western offshore, ONGC said in a release.

It, however, did not elaborate on the nature of the partnership and if ExxonMobil will buy a stake in any of the blocks of ONGC.

""Collaboration between ONGC and ExxonMobil will be a strategic fit where ONGC's knowledge and past experience in these areas will be coupled with ExxonMobil's global insights,"" the release said.

With its import dependence rising to 85 per cent for meeting oil needs, India has been seeking technical and financial support from global oil majors to find newer resources and raise domestic production. ONGC, the nation's top oil and gas producer, has been in talks with ExxonMobil for several months now to explore a partnership.

The two firms had in 2019 signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to undertake joint studies. That pact included working on deepwater and other licenses of ONGC on the east and west coasts and jointly bidding for acreage offered in future bid rounds. ONGC's Head of Exploration Rajesh Kumar Srivastava said his company is looking for a ""long-lasting partnership with Exxon"".

""Through the discovery route, ONGC hopes to move to development wherein the inherent strength of ExxonMobil would be beneficial for efficient fast-track monetization,"" he said.

""This will enable ONGC to ensure steps towards energy security for India."" ExxonMobil India's CEO and Lead Country Manager Monte K Dobson said, ""It's an exciting opportunity to collaborate with ONGC. Great things happen when the right people collaborate.""

He further added that 25 per cent of the ExxonMobil brain power is currently engaged in evaluating Indian deepwater. ""ExxonMobil is geared up to take this collaboration to the next level.""",342,0.9956451058387756

Motilal Oswal's research report on ONGC

ONGC reported an in line EBITDA of INR259.3b (up 113% YoY and 39% QoQ), with an in line oil realization at USD108.5/bbl (up 65% YoY and 14% QoQ) and crude oil sales at 5mmt (flat YoY and QoQ). Although we expect crude oil prices to hover at USD60-70/bbl in the long run, the prevailing strength made us raise our FY23/FY24 realization estimate to USD79/USD90 per bbl after factoring in the impact of the windfall tax. In our base case, we have assumed a continuation of the windfall tax till Dec’22. Any continuation beyond that may result in EPS cuts. We build in domestic gas price realization of USD7.7/USD5.7 per mmBtu in FY23/FY24.



Outlook

We expect a gas/oil production of 3% CAGR each over FY21-24. Factoring all this, we have largely left unchanged our standalone EBITDA estimate, but have reduced our consolidated EBITDA estimate by 17%/4% for FY23/FY24 due to a sharp cut in HPCL’s projections. We value the company at 3.5x FY24E adjusted EPS of INR41.1 and add value of investments to arrive at our TP of INR177. We maintain our Buy rating.

Tullow is the current operator of the project and has a 50% stake, while partners Africa Oil Corp. and TotalEnergies SE hold 25% each.

The potential deal signals the revival of Kenya’s aspiration to export oil on a commercial scale since Tullow discovered crude in the East African country in 2012. Tullow submitted a final field development program to the government in December, boosting the project that had stalled as the company focused on managing debt and finalizing its strategy.

India's top oil explorer ONGC and its partners will invest USD 6.2 billion (Rs 50,000 crore) in green energy projects to produce carbon-free hydrogen and green ammonia as part of an ambitious decarbonization drive, officials said.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has signed a pact with Greenko, one of India's largest renewable energy companies, to form a 50:50 joint venture for green energy projects.

The JV will set up 5.5-7 gigawatts (GW) of solar and wind power projects, and use electricity generated from such plants to split water in an electrolyzer to produce green hydrogen, which in turn would be used for manufacturing green ammonia, they said.

The renewable plants together with Greenko's pump storage power generation system will give 1.4 GW of round-the-clock (RTC) electricity that would be used to produce 0.18 million tonne of green hydrogen per annum (about 20 kg per hour).

This hydrogen will be mixed with nitrogen to produce 1 million tonne per annum of green ammonia, which in the initial years will be exported to Europe, Japan and Korea and used within the country when the market develops, they said.

Officials said the renewable energy component of the chain would cost about USD 5 billion while the hydrogen and ammonia plant will cost USD 1.2 billion. ONGC is looking to set up the hydrogen and ammonia plants, which are likely to start production in 2026, on the west coast, preferably near Mangalore, where it has an oil refinery.

In case the land is not available, the project may shift to Gujarat, they said. ONGC, the nation's biggest producer of crude oil and natural gas, joins the likes of Reliance Industries Ltd and the Adani group in chasing carbon-free hydrogen.

The two private groups have announced multi-billion projects as part of India's net-zero goals. ONGC, the nation's biggest producer of crude oil and natural gas, joins the likes of Reliance Industries Ltd and the Adani group in chasing carbon-free hydrogen.

While hydrogen is the cleanest known fuel with zero carbon emission, it is difficult to transport and a vast majority of its production globally is used in-situ (onsite). And for these reasons, ONGC is looking at manufacturing green ammonia from hydrogen.

Ammonia, which is widely used as a fertilizer, can easily be shipped. The production cost of green ammonia is high, and so its usage in India will be limited to begin with. In countries like Japan and Korea, the law provides for use of a certain percentage of green ammonia and so they can be a natural market.

Green ammonia can also be used as a marine fuel. Globally, hydrogen is seen as a decarbonization fuel as it can replace polluting fossil fuels.

India is targeting the production of 5 million tonne of green hydrogen per annum by 2030. Hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant element in the universe, but it barely exists in a pure form. Instead, it is abundant in chemical compounds, most notably bonded with oxygen in water or carbon to form hydrocarbons like fossil fuels.

For that reason, hydrogen is not considered an energy source but an energy carrier or vector. Once separated from other elements, hydrogen's utility increases: it can be converted into electricity through fuel cells, it can be combusted to produce heat or power without emitting carbon dioxide, used as a chemical feedstock, or as a reducing agent to reduce iron ores to pure iron for steel production. ""Transporting hydrogen is an issue and so it is consumed in-situ,"" one of the officials said. ""And so green ammonia makes sense for us. We have ready availability of nitrogen.""

Globally, around 85 per cent of hydrogen is captive, produced and consumed on-site, mainly at petroleum refineries. Most of the hydrogen currently produced in India is either grey (produced from fossil fuel) or blue (produced from natural gas with the carbon dioxide by-product being captured and stored).

Green hydrogen is made using electrolysis powered by renewable energy to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen, creating an emissions-free fuel. Fossil-based hydrogen currently costs about USD 1.80 per kilogram, while the cost of blue hydrogen, which is produced using natural gas and carbon capture, is estimated to be about USD 2.40 per kilogram. Green hydrogen costs USD 3-4.",721,

The MoU, valid for two years, was inked in New Delhi by ONGC director Onshore Anurag Sharma and Greenko CEO and Managing Director Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty, in the presence of Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri.

This MoU is in line with the National Hydrogen Mission launched by the Prime Minister in making India a global green hydrogen hub.

A green hydrogen policy was announced by the Centre in August 2021, promising cheaper renewable power, a fee waiver on interstate power transmission until 2025, land in renewable energy parks, and mega manufacturing zones to help local industries wean themselves off fossil fuels.

A surprise cut in additional taxes imposed on fuel exports and crude oil production has spiked energy sector prospects, said global brokerage Morgan Stanley.

“A quicker than expected restart to reverse the windfall taxes on the sector should normalise equity multiples steadily higher. While windfall taxes are not yet zero, we believe government action provides clarity on the path ahead. Reliance Industries, ONGC, and Oil India are key beneficiaries,” said Mayank Maheshwari, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.

There were talks of the government considering reducing or eliminating taxes but not many expected it would come this soon. The surprise move had the stock market opening with gains on July 20.

At the opening, BSE flagship Sensex jumped 587 points or 1.07 per cent to 55,355 driven by over two percent jump in Reliance and some heavy buying in large-cap IT names. ONGC was up five percent, Oil India seven percent, Mangalore Refinery five percent and Chennai Petroleum over eight percent.

The Centre reduced the windfall tax on diesel and aviation fuel shipments by Rs 2 per litre and scrapped a Rs 6 per litre levy on gasoline exports. It also cut the tax on domestically produced crude by about 27 percent to Rs 17,000 a tonne.

“While in absolute terms the windfall taxes are still high, we believe steady normalisation in local fuel availability (a key energy security concern for the government), stability in oil prices, more normalised global fuel margins, and currency stability will help further reduction in windfall

taxes under fortnightly review,” said Maheshwari.

The taxes were imposed to get a pie of windfall gains that oil companies were making due to high international prices of crude oil and oil derivatives. Refining margins of some companies had reached record high.

Now that taxes have been partly rationalised, Reliance, Oil India, and ONGC will see a reduction in overhang and equity valuations should start pricing in high sustainable energy margins as the government intent gets clear, said Maheshwari. The tax cut also lowers investor concerns on a potential downgrade cycle for the stocks in a recessionary demand environment.

“We believe Reliance should get priced at $13-15 per barrel (bbl) sustainable refinery margins while ONGC gets priced at $75-80 per bbl oil and $6 per mmbtu commodity deck. The two should imply 25-40 percent upside to equities as energy markets are expected to remain tight despite the current volatility in oil and reduction in global fuel margins from peak levels,” he added.

Morgan Stanley estimates current gross refining margins for Reliance at $13 per bbl. ONGC, it estimates, is seeing profit per bbl at $25, 20 percent above last year's levels.

A massive crash in refining margins of diesel, petrol and ATF coinciding with a cool-off in crude oil prices from their peaks in June has diminished the super-profits of refiners, a report said on Wednesday.

In a surprise move, the government on July 1 slapped export duties on petrol and ATF (Rs 6 per litre or USD 12 per barrel) and diesel (Rs 13 a lire or USD 26 a barrel) and imposed a windfall tax on domestic crude production (Rs 23,250 per tonne or USD 40 per bbl).

At that time, the finance ministry stated that the taxes will be reviewed every fortnight. ”The last two weeks have seen a massive crash in the refining spreads (or margins) of diesel, gasoline (petrol) and aviation fuel (ATF) coinciding with a cool-off in crude prices from their respective peaks seen in June,” brokerage CLSA said.

”This questions the need for the continuation of the windfall tax imposed about two weeks back,” it said. Post windfall tax, the realised spread on diesel and gasoline has fallen to near loss-making levels while the realisation on aviation fuel and crude have also gone below 15-year averages.

”A USD 12 per barrel windfall tax on this takes the realised refining spread down to a near loss-making level of just USD 2 per barrel. Similarly, the diesel spread after the export tax of USD 26 per barrel would be a meagre USD 2 a barrel,” it said.

At the time of announcing the windfall tax, government officials took pains to explain that this should be seen as an extraordinary step at a time of super-normal gains for oil companies. They also promised a review of this tax every 15-days.

”With the next review due later this week, this sharp decline in global prices may force a re-think of this tax. One may not expect the government to react so quickly but we see a good chance for relief in one of the subsequent reviews this quarter if the price remains around current levels,” the brokerage said.

If this tax remains for long, it may hamper the positioning of India as an export and manufacturing-friendly regime. ”We expect a rethink in one of the fortnightly reviews promised by the government if current prices continue,” it said. ”Any relaxation would be a big trigger for ONGC and Oil India and a relief for Reliance Industries Ltd.”

While the windfall tax on domestic crude oil production was seen hitting state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation’s (ONGC) earnings severely, the export duties could shave off up to USD 12 per barrel in refining margins for Reliance, which had in recent months ramped up fuel exports to capture demand in Europe and elsewhere.

Stating that windfall tax review was more likely than expected, CLSA said in the last few days have seen a reasonably large fall in crude prices as well as spreads for key refined products on the back of rising worries over oil demand as recession fears grow.

The refining spread for diesel has almost halved from the USD 55-60 per barrel peak seen in June to USD 30 a barrel. Similarly, ATF spreads crashed from USD 50-55 per barrel to USD 25-30. Gasoline spreads have also been slashed from USD 30-35 per barrel last month to USD 10-15.

At the same time, the Brent crude price has also cooled off by USD 15-20 per barrel in the past 2-3 weeks to about USD 100 per barrel. ”This quick and dramatic fall in crude and product spreads significantly reduces any ’super-normal’ gains for refiners as well as crude oil producers and possibly questions the need for the continuation of the windfall tax imposed about two weeks ago,” the brokerage said. ”

Although the spot Brent crude and ATF spreads are still above 15-year averages, post-windfall tax implies realisations way below their 15-year averages.",648,-0.794982449574904

ONGC was down 5.5 per cent as of 10.50 am on BSE while Oil India fell 7 per cent. In the last five days, both stocks are down 21 and 31 per cent respectively.

Oil plummeted about 9 per cent on Tuesday in the biggest daily drop since March on growing fears of a global recession and lockdowns in China that could slash demand. Brent crude oil traded close to $102 per barrel.

Shanghai said it would begin new rounds of mass testing of its 25 million residents over a three day period, citing an effort to trace infections linked to an outbreak at a karaoke bar. This has stoked fears of lockdown and drop in demand.

Sunil Singhania of Abakkus said he expects 2-3 per cent drop in demand due to rising pump prices. Citi, meanwhile, in its latest report said a recession may lead crude oil to as low as $65 per barrel.

This accentuates the problem for oil firms especially after the government imposed $40 a barrel taxes on windfall gains which dented the earnings outlook of ONGC and Oil India in the medium term and led to downgrades by brokerages.

Others in the petroleum block, especially refiners including Reliance Industries, Chennai Petroleum and Mangalore Refinery, were down up to 10 per cent. Oil marketing companies (OMCs) were trading with gains of up to 3 per cent.

It also announced a cess of Rs 23,250 per tonne on locally produced crude oil.

Morgan Stanley believes the windfall tax on “extraordinary” profits from the export of petroleum products will leave ONGC battered while Reliance Industries can manage the changes in a better way.

The government earlier in the day imposed a Rs 6 per litre tax on exports of petrol and jet fuel and Rs 13 per litre on exports of diesel. It also announced a cess of Rs 23,250 per tonne on locally produced crude oil.

“Export taxes/restrictions and windfall taxes on oil producers are a global trend and highlight the tightening energy market outlook. India's announcement is incrementally negative for sector valuations,” said Mayank Maheshwari, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.

The rationale behind the government's decision to impose a windfall tax is that oil companies are reaping huge profits due to high international prices of crude oil as well as finished products. And, this gives them a reason not to apply fuel domestically. Hence, taxes have been imposed to deter the practice.

The government has also put some export restrictions. It said the exporters would be required to declare at the time of exports that 50 percent of the quantity mentioned in the shipping bill has been/will be supplied in the domestic market during the current FY. This; however, does not apply to special economic zone (SEZ) refiners like Reliance Industries.

Morgan Stanley said the higher cess on domestic crude production of ONGC and Oil India (OIL) was a negative surprise and should imply downside risks for the sector multiple over the medium term. It impacts ONGC and OIL earnings for FY23 by 36 percent and 24 percent, respectively, it added.

Shares of ONGC and Oil India – which were outperforming the market this year so far – were down 14 and 15 percent, respectively, over the previous day after the announcement. Vedanta, which has oil rigs under Cairns Oil & Gas, was also down 4 percent.

However, the biggest impact on the market was from a 7 percent drop in Reliance Industries (RIL). It has one of the highest weights in Nifty and was single-handedly responsible for headline indices being in the red on Friday.

“Assuming the full impact of the regulations on both diesel and gasoline, RIL's gross refining margins (GRM) would be negatively impacted by $6-8/bbl (barrel) realistically versus last week's margin of $24-26/bbl. This would still be above our base case estimates on earnings. Every $1/bbl impacts RIL's earnings by 2.5-3 per cent,” said Maheshwari.

Maheshwari added that most other refiners largely sell locally and the impact on earnings will be limited.

Shares of export focussed oil refiners were left in the lurch on Friday after the government imposed taxes on windfall gains they were making thanks to rising refining margins.

Media reports said the government imposed Rs 6 per litre special additional excise duty on export of air turbine fuels (ATFs) and diesel exports, while levying Rs 5/litre duty on petrol. The Centre also imposed additional taxes on local oil drillers at the rate of Rs 23,259 per tonne, CNBC Tv-18 said citing the Finance Ministry.

The decision led to a bloodbath in the petroleum block on Dalal Street. Reliance Industries, which has the largest refinery in the world in Jamnagar, slumped 7 per cent to trade at Rs 2,400 level. It single handedly took the market down as well. At the height of the selling, the stock eroded Rs 1.2 lakh crore of shareholders' wealth.

Mangalore Refinery and Chennai Petroleum were also down about 8 per cent each. Both stocks had gained recently thanks to the improving outlook on exports of petroleum products. ONGC and Vedanta that have oil rigs in India were down 5 per cent each.

Benchmark refining margins of petroleum refiners had reached close to $30 per barrel thanks to cheap flow of oil from Russia and high demand of petroleum products from Europe, which made it lucrative to export products.

This had also made many analysts go long on stocks like Reliance Industries, ONGC and Vedanta. For instance, earlier this week Bernstein came out with a report that had a stock target of Rs 3,360 for Reliance Industries. Average broker target on ONGC is Rs 200. Similarly, JP Morgan earlier this week said Vedanta had value thanks to stable crude oil and high demand and low supply for zinc.

The Ministry has proposed that any candidate to be eligible for consideration should not be more than 60 years of age on the date of occurrence of vacancy, according to the Ministry's office memorandum sent to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on June 17.

The vacancy arose after Shashi Shanker superannuated on March 31, 2021. At present, the minimum age prescribed for being eligible for the top job is 45 years. Besides, internal candidates need to have two years of residual service as on the date of vacancy and three years for external candidates.

What the Ministry has proposed now is that any eligible candidate who is not more than 60 years of age at the time of occurrence of vacancy, which was April 1, 2021, should be considered eligible. This would essentially mean that the present acting chairman, Alka Mittal, who otherwise would retire in August-end and was ineligible, would come under the zone of consideration. As per existing rules, Mittal was not eligible for the post when the government headhunter interviewed candidates in June last year.

The Ministry has also proposed appointment for a period of three years from the date of joining instead of the present five-year term, according to the letter. The selection will be done via a three-member search-cum-selection committee headed by PESB chairman and composed of oil secretary and former Indian Oil chairman B Ashok (outside expert).

The panel was formed on February 4, 2022 but the terms of reference are being framed only now. Most board-level appointments at public sector companies are done on the basis of recommendations of the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) but the government headhunter in June last year did not find anyone suitable among nine candidates, including two serving IAS officers, to head Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC).

""Keeping in view the strategic importance and vision for the company and its future, the board did not recommend any candidate and decided to constitute a search committee,"" the Ministry letter said, referring to PESB's interviews on June 5, 2021. The panel was constituted after eight months of that recommendation on February 4.

The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) approved ""consideration of central government officers, including those of the armed forces of the Union and the all India services for the post on immediate absorption basis.""

""Energy security is critical for the nation. ONGC plays a pivotal role in exploration as India's National Oil Company (NOC). Its activities need to be scaled significantly and rapidly. As an NOC, it is necessary to have a specially designed 'sui generis' job description for ONGC in order to attract the best talent available,"" it said. If accepted, the proposal will throw open the field for ONGC's former director (finance) Subhash Kumar as well as current acting chairman Alka Mittal, who otherwise were ineligible for the post.

As per the practice, PESB recommends a name for a board-level position at least three months prior to arising of the vacancy. However, in the case of ONGC, PESB advertised and interviewed candidates after the retirement of Shashi Shanker on March 31, 2021. After Shanker retired, Subhash Kumar, director for finance and the senior-most director on the ONGC board, was given the additional charge as Chairman and Managing Director.

Kumar retired on December 31, 2021 and Alka Mittal, Director for Human Resources, ONGC, was given additional charge. She will superannuate in August. Other internal directors of ONGC would also become eligible due to the age relaxation.

The committee route for appointment of PSU board members has very sparingly been used in the past. In 2016, the present NTPC chairman Gurdeep Singh was appointed via the route. Last appointment using the route was that of Sanjeev Kumar as the Chairman of Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL). PESB had on June 5, 2021, interviewed nine out of the 10 candidates who had applied for the post of Chairman and Managing Director of ONGC. Those interviewed included senior bureaucrats Avinash Joshi and Niraj Verma.

Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) director-finance Pomila Jaspal and ONGC director for technology and field services Om Prakash Singh were the other prominent names who were interviewed, as per the PESB notice. Both the bureaucrats are from the 1994 batch of IAS officers belonging to the Assam-Meghalaya cadre.

Others interviewed by PESB were ONGC executive directors Sandeep Gupta, Pankaj Kumar and Omkar Nath Gyani, ONGC additional director general Anand Gupta, and Container Corporation of India director-finance Manoj Kumar Dubey. Security Printing and Minting Corp of India Ltd director-finance Ajay Agarwal, who had applied for the job, did not appear for the interview.

This was the second time in one-and-a-half decades that a suitable candidate was not found among those who had applied. In August 2006, PESB chose RS Sharma to head the company but the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in February 2007 vetoed his appointment as it wanted the selection process to be widened by inviting candidates from the private sector.

In June 2007, PESB again selected Sharma and his candidature was this time endorsed by the Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC). While a replacement to the PSU board position is often selected before the incumbent retires, PESB did not hold any interviews for almost seven months as its chairman wasn't appointed. The government in April 2021 named Mallika Srinivasan, Chairman and Managing Director of Tractors and Farm Equipment (TAFE) Ltd, as the new chairperson of PESB.

She is the first person from the private sector to be appointed as the head of PESB.",970,

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), is facing temporary disruptions in moving its share of oil from the Sakhalin-1 project in Far East Russia due to sanctions against Russia, its Managing Director Alok Gupta said.

OVL holds a 20 per cent stake in Sakhalin-1 where ExxonMobil's Russian subsidiary, Exxon Neftegaz, is the operator. Exxon has announced its exit from the project following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and has reportedly begun withdrawing expatriates from the project.

Sakhalin-1 produced around 271,000 barrels of oil per day in January and February 2022, according to the Russian Energy Ministry data, against the average of 227,000 bpd last year. Output has slipped after sanctions against Russia made it difficult to ship oil from the project. Production slipped to just over 60,000 barrels per day between May 1 and 15, Moscow-based news agency Interfax reported.

""There are temporary disruptions because of the force majeure taken in the case of Sakhalin-1,"" Gupta said at an investor call post-ONGC's FY22 earnings. ""This situation is going to be normalized over the next two-three weeks, as we are finding out the alternative measures."" He did not elaborate on alternatives being explored.

The ExxonMobil-led Sakhalin-1 consortium declared force majeure on its scheduled oil export shipments to Asia after it faced difficulties in chartering ice-resistant tankers to ship oil from the De-Kastri marine export terminal located on Sakhalin Island in Russia's Khabarovsk region. These tankers are operated by Russian state-owned shipper Sovcomflot that is subject to sanctions from the US and Europe.

Shipowners are facing difficulty in arranging insurance coverage. Gupta said the sea between the Khabarovsk region and Sakhalin usually clears of ice by June and so the ice-class vessels and ice-breaking support are needed before that.

According to the transcript of the call, he termed Exxon's exit from Russia as a result of a ""grandstanding or let's say high moral stance taken not exactly in the terms of energy sanctions which have been imposed, but (due to) high moral grounds.""

The refusal to provide production and indemnity cover for the ice-class vessels has led to an inability to move crude from the terminal to the transfer point which is in South Korea, he said. ""This temporary disruption is going to be there for a couple of months because of which we are having suppressed production from Sakhalin."" OVL, however, hasn't so far faced any problem in the repatriation of money from Russia.

""In terms of all our dividends, let me be very happy to share with you that we received all our money as was due till March this year,"" he said. ""The next money that will be due from Vankorneft in the form of dividends will be sometime in July. We are working along with the partners as to how that money will flow in July when it will become due."" OVL holds a 26 per cent stake in Suzunskoye, Tagulskoye and Lodochnoye fields -- collectively known as the Vankor cluster in the north-eastern part of West Siberia.

""The Russian crude is selling at a discount. We are not able to sell crude from Sakhalin because of the current situation in terms of not being able to move the crude out,"" He said adding there was no problem with OVL's other projects in Russia - Vankorneft and Imperial Energy. Crude from Vankorneft and Imperial, he said, is flowing through the pipelines to the neighboring countries, and OVL is realising its price.

""There are some discounts which are happening for the portions of the crude which are getting exported."" Crude from Vankorneft and Imperial, he said, is flowing through the pipelines to the neighboring countries, and OVL is realising its price.

Gupta said OVL being an acquisition company looks for assets across the globe. ""As we speak, we are looking at three-four major geographies where there are significantly important and valuable opportunities available to us.""",714,-0.9955666661262512

Alka Mittal took additional charge as chairman and managing director of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation in January, becoming the first woman to head the country’s largest exploration and production company. She hit the ground running and identified collaborations for exploration and production and a thrust on technology as key areas to steer and scale up the state-owned energy company as India strives for energy security.

In an interview with Moneycontrol’s Rachita Prasad, Mittal, 59, shared how her goals include keeping an open mind.

ONGC has not had a full-time head for over a year. Given the possibility that she may have to pass on the baton to an interim CMD, her words of advice on succession at ONGC: there is enough talent within the company for the top job. Edited excerpts:

ONGC has not had a fulltime head since Shashi Shanker retired in March 2021. The government is still hunting and there is speculation that someone from the private sector could be considered. What is your view?

I was sharing the stage at the results announcement with directors of our company – each one of them to my left and right is a good candidate to lead the company. In fact, even among the other senior executives present in the room, there are people who have good potential to be directors or even the chairman in the next few years. ONGC has excellent personnel with solid experience, high level of integrity and commitment to organisation. Why should we not give them an opportunity?

There have been delays in appointing senior directors and heads among public sector companies. Your appointment was for six months. Is there a need for better succession planning?

Ideally, we should have finalised a full-fledged CMD at least a month before Shashi Shanker retired. If we knew who the next CMD would be, that person would have been engaged as the next incumbent. That would have been the best scenario. I had to step in because we could not identify a fulltime replacement after Shanker and another director from within was made the interim CMD and then even he retired. Now, I am looking at handing over the position to our current director of exploration. But that is not the way the organisation, which is the largest oil and gas company of the country and gives the best of returns, should be operated, so casually. The government has also understood this. Let’s see what kind of decisions they make. But they are seeing the potential in our personnel. Our minister, secretary, and other senior officials visited offshore sites and they could see the kind of inherent technical edge our people have. ONGC-ians that leave our company occupy top positions in private companies – that is the kind of potential we have. So why should our colleagues not get that opportunity?

You came in when there is so much volatility in the global energy market. What is the opportunity for you and what is your agenda? What is it that you would like to achieve?

When I took over, that was the time when I was actually planning to hang up my boots at the end of my tenure, which is to happen in August…

I would say while I have been a part of this organisation for 37 years, I realised that what I am doing as a CMD is so much more meaningful for the company and much more meaningful for me…

I realised that in a period of eight to nine months, I should make a difference, which would be remembered. The first thing I decided is that we should look at things with an open mind, we should not feel that if the government is conveying something to us, should we go for it or not. They are, after all, not only our major stakeholders, but they see ONGC not just for the financial part but for the future of our economy. If we are able to produce better, if we are able to generate better crude and better in terms of physical performance, we are able to contribute to the economy. So that is one thing.

Secondly, we also had to look at how we can collaborate with the other experts in this area. ONGC may be excellent, we may be the best from our point of view, but there are others from different parts of the globe, who have been in this field for as long, maybe longer.

Third is the use of technology, where we know technology can step in, whether it is in the area of HR or it is in the technical domains. Why should we not free our people, our experts, our domain experts to take on the roles which would ensure that with the use of technology, we are able to get better results.

Five years ago, we had 33,000 employees. Out of those, 5,000 were not even diploma holders. A major chunk was the technical workforce. Today, we have around 26,600 employees who are very committed, technical domain personnel. There are quite a few engineers who have joined us at staff level, not executive cadre, because they see value in being a part of an organisation like ONGC. Today, 50 percent of our workforce is less than 40 years old.

ONGC is looking for collaboration in exploration and production and has even invited bids. By when can we see something fructifying in that space?

The response to the first round was not as big a hit as it could have been, maybe because we were starting out and others were also not aware of what we were heading towards. The second round, which has just taken place, is getting us a much better response because while we have looked at it with all the best of intent, we have also made sure that we look at it from the other’s point of view. We can’t just dictate all our terms. If we are able to develop relations with some service providers, we could potentially collaborate and develop some assets, which would free some of our resources to take on major challenging fields.

It’s a work in progress, it should not take long. I won’t be able to say if the collaborations can happen in two-three months, but I am reasonably hopeful that it should happen this year.

You have set an ambitious target of Rs 10,000 crore investment every year on exploration alone for the next three years. Would this be completely organic?

It is organic. Like I said, we need some collaboration with some of the players like Equinor ASA. These players have experience in similar kinds of fields, they could contribute towards making us understand our subsurface much better. We are ourselves very capable and the capacities we are creating are not only on the manpower front, but also on the technical front.

The rise in crude oil prices and geopolitical tensions are beyond our control. This has highlighted the need to scale up production, but India’s output continues to decline. Where is it that we are slipping and what can be done?

I will not talk about slipping anywhere. Two years of the COVID pandemic were bad. We have these old, aging fields from which we try to draw the best and then we keep adding acreages and further production plans. It’s a cycle. So while we are going ahead with that, some of the plans which were to take off in the last two years could not because of issues that were faced in different offshore locations. That has directly impacted the levels of production. Now is the time when these things are happening. In fact, our jack-up rig Sagar Samrat came back and is ready to be commissioned. Normally, we are not able to commission major projects in the monsoon but as soon as it is over, it will be commissioned and will add to our numbers. Around 7,500 barrels per day will be added – that’s a huge amount. We just have to wait and watch for a couple of more months.

What is the best-case scenario for ONGC? What kind of production growth can we see and over what timelines?

By the end of the year, we will be able to talk about it with more confidence because these projects, like a KG 98/2, are likely to be completed by May ’23. In fact, in gas fields there, three wells have already been drilled and we are expecting good production.

The eastern coast, which was till now just a place where we were investing, is now going to get us results. I am sure we will be getting good news on the western coast too; it remains our karmabhoomi for now.

The government’s stance on the Russia-Ukraine situation, especially with respect to energy, is very clear. ONGC also has equity investments in Russia. What is the mandate for you? Is this an opportunity or a challenge?

There has been no mandate as such given to ONGC. We have been discussing our apprehensions and our opportunities that we see in that area to decide what we bid for or not. ONGC Videsh Ltd. has a presence in 18 domains in different countries. Each of these would have some unique geopolitical issues; the team is equipped to deal with them. Despite those issues, they are continuing to make progress in the projects we have taken up in those domains.

The Russian situation is definitely a little challenging. We are looking at opportunities there, we are waiting and watching. There’s a lot of talk happening, but very little substantive information is coming out. The Western countries are talking about withdrawing but we are not seeing much action there on that front.

What is your assessment of the sanctions? Given Europe’s dependence on Russia for energy, will they be able to go ahead with it?

We don’t know what is going on in their minds. But when we are making plans, we are very clear that if we are able to get resources for our country or we are able to invest for the sake of energy efficiency or energy security of our nation, we would like to. If we can go to other economies, which are geopolitically compromised, why not there? We are looking at the situation and we are ready to make decisions if we feel that it is going to be of help to the company as well as the country.

You are the first woman to head ONGC. It is rare to have women in the top positions in energy companies globally. When you started working, there were fewer women in this sector. Did you have any role models?

I grew up with three brothers. I never thought of gender when I was setting my targets. I was only looking at the role and whether it is exciting enough. So when I applied for and became the first director-HR, I just thought that I worked for it and I am here by virtue of my competence. And why not? When this responsibility of being the CMD of ONGC came my way, I told myself that I have been with the team and at the board. I can take this on as well.

ONGC is among the few companies that has women as head of the company and as head of finance…

And it’s not like how some private players appoint women because it needs to be done at the board level. We had 8 percent women in ONGC as of May 1. The number has been growing over the last five-seven years. If we recruit 500 executives, 100 of them are girls. We have 161 girls working in the fields – they are working offshore and onshore. Of course, it motivates them to see women in the top roles.",1991,0.4304234523039598

For over five months now, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has had no representative on the board of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd – a company in which it owns a 51.11 per cent stake since January 2018.

HPCL, under its new chairman Pushp Kumar Joshi, is however trying to resolve the situation, top officials said.

HPCL for over one-and-a-half years – between January 2018 and August 2019 – did not recognise ONGC as its promoter despite the government selling its entire 51.11 per cent stake in the company to the oil explorer.

It relented only after a rap from market regulator SEBI. ONGC got the right to appoint one director who HPCL called ’Government Nominee Director (Representative of ONGC)’.

Officials said since then ONGC appointed one of its directors as the nominee director.

Its last nominee director was Alka Mittal, Director (HR) who was appointed to the HPCL board in April 2021.

Officials said since then ONGC appointed one of its directors as the nominee director.

Its last nominee director was Alka Mittal, Director (HR) who was appointed to the HPCL board in April 2021.

In January this year, Mittal was given additional charge of chairman and managing director of ONGC after the retirement of the incumbent.

And following the past practice of the company that chairman could only sit on the board of a subsidiary in the capacity as chairman and not as a director, Mittal resigned from the board of HPCL and another director was nominated. HPCL promptly took note of it.

In a stock exchange filing on January 6, 2022, HPCL said, ""Alka Mittal has tendered resignation from the position of the Government Nominee Director (Representative of ONGC) of the company effective January 05, 2022.”

Officials said as per rules, Mittal also sent her resignation from the HPCL board to the Union Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas – the parent ministry of ONGC and HPCL.

The ministry however rejected the resignation and asked Mittal to continue on the HPCL board for ”strategic reasons”, they said.

The ministry however rejected the resignation and asked Mittal to continue on the HPCL board for ”strategic reasons”, they said.

ONGC thereafter approached HPCL for reinstatement but the company said it wanted written instructions from the ministry as it had already accepted Mittal’s resignation and changed its books, officials said adding while the firms went into letter writing, HPCL’s annual accounts for fiscal 2021-22 were approved without a nominee of its principal promoter.

A top HPCL official said the company is trying to resolve the issue and its relations with ONGC have improved since Joshi took over less than a month back.

""We have to realise that we are employee-directors on board and not promoter-directors,” he said, referring to directors to PSUs being appointed in the capacity as government employees and not as promoters of the company.

Prior to this changed attitude, HPCL had refused to recognise ONGC as its promoter.

It had ignored directives from the government as well as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), forcing the latter to set a deadline of August 13, 2019, and warn of ”appropriate action” if it failed.

It had ignored directives from the government as well as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), forcing the latter to set a deadline of August 13, 2019, and warn of ”appropriate action” if it failed.

This forced the HPCL management to make amends.

Before the SEBI order, HPCL listed ONGC as a public shareholder in its regulatory filings.

The President of India was listed under the promoter/promoter group category with nil shares.

In September 2018, SEBI first advised HPCL to re-file the shareholding pattern to the stock exchanges revising the status of ONGC as ’promoter’.

In September 2018, SEBI first advised HPCL to re-file the shareholding pattern to the stock exchanges revising the status of ONGC as ’promoter’.

In June 2019, the ministry too directed HPCL to indicate ’President of India’ as the promoter of HPCL and ONGC also to be added as a promoter below ’President of India’.

These were ignored on the pretext that the company needed clarifications from multiple agencies, officials said.

In an August 6, 2019 letter, SEBI again advised HPCL to re-file the shareholding pattern to the stock exchanges for all quarters since the acquisition of shares by ONGC, while revising the status of ONGC as a ’promoter’, by August 13, 2019, failing which appropriate action will be initiated as per SEBI Act. HPCL made amends thereafter.

While the promoter tag did not bring any specific privileges to ONGC, a lack of the tag keeps it out of insider trading regulations as it gets the full agenda of every board meeting of HPCL and could be aware of price-sensitive information.

""Improved cash flow continues to support the rating” of ONGC, it said in a statement.

While ONGC gets price equivalent to international oil rates for the crude oil it produces from fields such as Mumbai High, the government fixed price of natural gas based on a formula that factors in global indices.

While oil prices are hovering at multi-year high, gas prices for ONGC too have risen to best ever rate of USD 6.1 per million British thermal unit.

""ONGC will direct more than 60 per cent of its improved cash flows to capital investments over the next few years. We expect the company to spend Rs 55,000-60,000 crore in fiscal 2023 (ending March 31, 2023) compared with less than Rs 45,000 crore that it has spent annually for the past two years in view of challenging business conditions,” it said.

Of this, ONGC intends to spend Rs 31,000 crore over the next three years on exploration activities, compared with close to Rs 21,000 crore for the last three years.

""This increase will offset the decline in the company’s recent production to 43.4 million tonne of oil equivalent (mmtoe) in fiscal 2022 from 48.25 mmtoe in fiscal 2020. We anticipate these investments will also aid earnings resilience if prices start to decline,” S&P said.

ONGC is also likely to maintain healthy dividend distribution to shareholders, it said.

""The company paid about Rs 13,000 crore in dividends in fiscal 2022, equivalent to about 30 per cent of its free operating cash flows. ONGC has shown good flexibility in the past when it scaled back dividends to about Rs 3,000 crore in fiscal 2021 due to the challenging business conditions. However, given the healthy earnings outlook, we expect the company to maintain its stated financial policy of returning 40-50 per cent of net income to shareholders,” it said.

The rating agency said favourable crude oil prices will support ONGC’s earnings over the next 12 months and underpin the increased investments.

It revised its forecast for Brent crude oil price for the rest of 2022 to USD 90 per barrel and USD 75 a barrel for 2023.

This compares with about USD 76 per barrel that ONGC realized in fiscal 2022.

""The recent increase in India’s natural gas price will also boost earnings. The formula-determined price increased to USD 6.1 per million British thermal unit (mmbtu) for the first half of fiscal 2023 from the earlier USD 2.90 per mmbtu,” it said.

Crude oil and gas contribute almost equally to ONGC’s overall production volumes.

""We expect ONGC’s earnings will increase 20-25 per cent in fiscal 2023 over fiscal 2022. We also estimate the company’s ratio of funds from operations to debt will remain 55-60 per cent in fiscal 2023 compared with our estimate of 50-55 per cent in fiscal 2022,” it added.",510,0.9902095437049866

Reversing the declining trend of the past few years, ONGC said its crude oil production will rise 11 per cent and natural gas output will jump 25 per cent after newer discoveries in the western and eastern offshore start producing.

In an investor presentation post FY22 earnings, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) said crude oil production will rise from 19.545 million tonnes in the financial year ended March 31 (2021-22) to 19.88 million tonnes this year and 21.588 million tonnes in the next year.

The output will climb to 21.701 million tonnes in 2024-25 (FY25). Similarly, gas production will rise from 20.907 billion cubic meters in 2021-22 to 21.097 bcm in current fiscal and 24.387 bcm in the next. In FY26, the output will reach 26.124 bcm. Similarly, gas production will rise from 20.907 billion cubic meters in 2021-22 to 21.097 bcm in current fiscal and 24.387 bcm in the next.

The output increase will be aided by projects to bring gas, found on both the east and the west coast. ONGC is betting on discoveries in KG-DWN-98/2 in the Bay of Bengal to do most of the heavy lifting, while the Cluster-8 marginal fields in the western offshore will supplement the production.

ONGC said it is also implementing the fourth phase of the redevelopment of the Mumbai High oil and gas fields, which will increase the recovery factor from the five-decade-old mature fields. India's dependence on imports to meet its crude oil needs has, in recent years, risen to 85 per cent as output from domestic fields continued to decline.

ONGC, the biggest crude oil and natural gas producer in the country, has over the years seen a steady decline in production from its mature and aging fields. But the firm is now stepping up on exploration campaign to find more reserves.

ONGC said it will spend Rs 31,000 crore from 2022 to 2025 on the exploration campaigns throughout the country. It is in a view to ""add around 1,00,000 square kilometers of new exploration area annually up to 2024-25,"" the firm said, adding, ""increase of acreage holding likely to further establish the resource potential of undiscovered plays and realisation of YTF (yet to find) reserves.""

This is a part of the company's Vision 2040 that calls for raising capacities and production across its portfolio of oil and gas exploration and production, downstream oil refining and petrochemicals and new energy businesses. The company, which started with an equity infusion of Rs 343 crore by the government more than six decades back, has generated a wealth of over Rs 9 lakh crore since then, and is now venturing on a new road to further enhance value.

The new Energy Strategy 2040 aims to raise domestic production from 50 million tonnes of crude oil and oil equivalent gas to 70 MMtoe (Million Metric tonne of oil equivalent) by 2040, the presentation said. Overseas output is seen rising from 15 MMtoe to 40 MMtoe.

With 35 million tonnes per annum of oil refining capacity vested in its two subsidiaries — HPCL and MRPL, ONGC is targeting to raise this capacity to around 100 million tonnes by 2040. Also, expansion in petrochemicals will be prioritised. ONGC is also looking to scale up its renewable energy portfolio to 10 Gigawatts from less than 200 MW currently.

Also, the firm has set up a USD 1 billion venture fund corpus for the incubation of new technologies that will aid in raising the output and finding newer resources, the presentation said.",624,0.5835488113490018

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Ltd aims to spend Rs 30,000 crore on capital expenditure in 2022-23, of which a third will be on exploration activities, senior management told reporters.

The company is planning to invest aggressively in exploration activities to the tune of Rs 31,000 crore over the next three years, said Chairperson and managing director Alka Mittal.

She also said that it is unlikely that the government would impose a new tax on windfall gains made by the company as crude oil prices soared, given the government’s push on increasing production to reduce dependence on energy imports.

When asked to comment on reports that the government may consider a windfall tax on oil and gas producers, both state-owned and private, to offset the increase in public expenditure, Mittal said, “There is no communication as such, no development in that regard.”

“The government has been conveying to us in so many words that now is the time when we should go aggressive on our expenses when it comes to either exploration or production. I don't think they would be talking about anything like this (windfall tax); I am fairly confident of that,” she said.

ONGC has set an ambitious target to double its upstream production, triple the refining capacity, develop 1 gigawatt of renewable energy capacity, and set up a $1 billion corpus for new frontier opportunities by 2040.

“Our strategy is to go aggressive on exploration, while ensuring that our capex for the production continues to be very stable and consistent, unlike what has happened in the world. There have been companies which have just withdrawn from investing in capex in the E&P sector,” she said.

The company said its oil plus oil equivalent gas (O+OEG) production stood at 43.387 million metric tons of oil equivalent (MMTOE) and it aims for a growth of 18.2% over the next three years.

""Our plan is that for each of the next three years, we want to add one lakh acreage for our exploration,” said Rajarshi Gupta, executive director- of corporate strategy and planning, who is slated to be the head of ONGC Videsh Ltd.

The United Kingdom has announced a 25 percent windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas firms and triggered speculations that other countries like India may follow suit. But ONGC’s senior management said that they expect the Indian government may refrain from doing it to encourage companies to spend from the profits to expand capacity.",446,0.5163122266530991

The government is not looking to impose any new tax on windfall gains that oil and gas producers earned from shooting energy prices, India’s top producer ONGC said Monday.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) reported bumper profits in the March quarter (when international prices soared to a near 14-year high of $139 per barrel) and record earnings in 2021-22, triggering talks of the government slapping a windfall tax.

""We have not received any communication on this,” ONGC chairman and managing director Alka Mittal told a news conference here.

Last week, Oil India Ltd (OIL) Chairman SC Mishra stated the same.

""The government has been conveying to us to go aggressively on (oil and gas) exploration and production spending so as to augment domestic output and cut import reliance,” Mittal said.

While the government earns 65-66 paise in taxes on every rupee that ONGC earns, the remaining is ploughed back into finding more oil and gas.

The absence of investment in exploration due to low oil prices in the past few years has been one big reason for global oil and gas production not keeping pace with demand globally.

The explorer had, however, not cut exploration and production spending even when oil prices were low, helping find and bring newer finds on to production to offset the natural decline that has set in old and mature fields.

""I don’t think they (government) will be talking about this (windfall tax),” Mittal said.

In recent days, the UK levied a 25 per cent tax on ""extraordinary"" profits from North Sea oil and gas production to raise $6.3 billion to help fund its support package.

The Indian government cut excise duty on petrol and diesel to ease inflationary pressure.

This move cost the government Rs 1 lakh crore and talk of a windfall tax is to cover this deficit.

Mittal said ONGC is spending Rs 30,000-32,000 crore annually to maintain output from ageing fields and find new reserves.

Without this spending, the output will fall and India’s 85 per cent import reliance will increase.

She said ONGC will spend Rs 31,000 crore over the next 3 years just on exploration.

It is implementing 6 projects at a cost of Rs 5,740 crore.

ONGC reported a record net profit of Rs 40,306 crore on a revenue of Rs 1,10,345 crore in the 2021-22 fiscal.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) share was trading in the green in the morning session after the company declared earnings on Saturday.

The firm reported a record net profit of Rs 40,305 crore in the fiscal year ended March, becoming India's second most profitable company after Reliance Industries. It said net profit for the fiscal soared 258 per cent to Rs 40,305.74 crore.

Consolidated net profit soared to Rs 49,294.06 crore in 2021-22 as compared to Rs 21,360.25 crore in 2020-21. Both standalone and consolidated net profit are the second-highest in the country.

The profit surge came despite a 3.7 percent drop in crude oil production to 21.7 million tonnes in 2021-22 as some of the firm's western offshore fields were hit by a severe cyclone in May last year. Gas output fell five percent to 21.68 billion cubic metres.

Standalone revenue from operations soared nearly 62 percent to Rs 1.10 lakh crore and consolidated turnover came in at Rs 5.31 lakh crore.

The company's overseas arm ONGC Videsh reported a 16 percent drop in net profit to Rs 1,589 crore for 2021-22 as crude oil and natural gas output fell. Its crude oil production declined to 8.099 million tonnes in 2021-22 from 8.51 million tonnes in the previous year. Gas output fell to 4.231 billion cubic metres from 4.529 bcm last year.

ONGC declared a final dividend of 65 percent (Rs 3.25 per share of face value Rs 5 each) taking the total dividend paid in the fiscal under review to 210 percent (Rs 10.50 a share).

At 09:30 AM, the stock was quoting at Rs 146.45, up Rs 2.70 or 1.88 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 147.35 and an intraday low of Rs 144.85.

Global research and broking firm Citi has maintained a sell call on the stock with a target of Rs 155: ""The quarter operationally was in line; headlines below estimates. Production trends remain disappointing while upside could get capped given our bearish outlook on crude prices. Potential windfall tax remains an overhang.""

Japanese research firm Nomura has a neutral call on the stock with target of Rs 185: ""Production continues on declining trend. Exploration capex to increase 1.5x.""

India's top oil and gas producer ONGC on Thursday said it will invest Rs 31,000 crore over the next three years in exploring the Indian sedimentary basin for fuel reserves which could augment the nation's production in its attempt to be self-reliant in the energy sector.

In a statement, ONGC said its board held a meeting on Thursday to firm up its 'Future Exploration Strategy'.

""The company has drawn up a comprehensive roadmap to further intensify its exploration campaign, allocating a capital expenditure of about Rs 31,000 crore in the next three fiscal years during FY 2022-25. This is 150 per cent of its exploration expenditure of Rs 20,670 crore in the last three fiscals during FY 2019-22,"" it said.

ONGC said it also plans to leverage international collaborations with reputed global majors for this, for which talks are in an advanced stage.

However, it did not elaborate. India is 85 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs and half of the natural gas requirement is shipped from abroad. Finding and producing more oil and gas domestically will cut this reliance, helping insulate the domestic market from volatility in international energy prices.

""This exploration intensification includes activities funded through ONGC's internal program as well as funded and facilitated by the government,"" the statement said. Under the internal program, ONGC is trying to probe around 1,700 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas (MMTOE) of yet-to-find (YTF) reserves during FY 2022-25.

The activities here include a state-of-the-art 2D and 3D seismic survey, followed by drilling of around 115-120 wells with an estimated outlay of Rs 10,000 crore every year for the next three years. In addition, the government's facilitation has resulted in the release of about 96,000 square kilometers of area so far, which was earlier demarcated as a 'No Go' zone. This will further help ONGC achieve its acreage acquisition program of bringing around 5,00,000 sq km under active exploration by 2025.

Under a government-funded program for appraisal of unapprised offshore areas till the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), 70,000 line kilometers (LKM) of state-of-the-art 2D broadband seismic data acquisition, processing and interpretation (API) will be done in three sectors -- west coast, east coast and Andaman offshore. ONGC will complete the technical bid opening (TBO) for seismic data acquisition by June 2022.

In Andaman Basin, ONGC presently holds two blocks for exploration under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP). ""Government of India has also acquired seismic data in some sectors within 'No-Go' areas and few prospects are already identified,"" it said without giving details.

ONGC plans to drill six wells in the next three years (two under ONGC committed work program and four through government funding). Reputed global companies/consultants are being invited for the assessment of the basin for future exploration and exploitation plan.

""ONGC's internal program has three components - re-exploration of mature basins, consolidation of emerging basins and probing of emerging and new basins,"" the statement said.",495,0.9448380668958029

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is offering a stake to foreign companies in its ultra deepsea gas discovery and a high-pressure, high-temperature block in the KG basin as it looks for financial and technological help to bring the challenging fields to production.

ONGC has floated an initial tender seeking interest of global majors with ""requisite technical expertise and financial strength"" to join as partners in development of the Deen Dayal West (DDW) block as well as ultra-deep discoveries in Cluster-III of its KG-D5 area.

Expressions of Interest (EoIs) have been invited by June 16, according to the tender floated by the company. While ONGC had made a gas discovery UD-1 in the KG-D5 block in water depth of 2,850 metres (almost 3 kilometers), the firm had in August 2017 paid Rs 7,738 crore for buying 80 per cent stake in the DDW block from Gujarat government firm GSPC.

On the one hand, ONGC does not have the requisite technology and expertise to develop the UD discovery, which lies about 150-km from the coast, while on the other hand it hasn't had much success in DDW block which holds reserves at high pressure and high temperature (HPHT). ONGC is seeking technology partners and service providers for the development of the two and is willing to offer an equity stake to firms interested, the tender document said.

It however did not say how much equity stake the company will offer. At the time of the acquisition of stake from GSPC in 2017, ONGC had stated that the acquisition fits well with its strategy to enhance natural gas production from domestic fields at a faster pace.

It had plans to use GSPC field facilities to bring to production the discoveries in its neighbouring KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) block. But the seven wells drilled to date did not yield much success. The plan to use DDW facilities too hasn't materialised.

""Four wells which were completed did not yield good productivity as anticipated and performance was sub-optimal. Severe technical challenges and complications were encountered in other three wells and had to be abandoned,"" the tender document said. GSPC had 9 gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal block. Of these, three — KG-08, KG-17, and KG-15 commonly known as DDW fields — had been approved for development.

ONGC had said it wants to revise the field development plan after firming up the well engineering and completion strategy for the implementation of new wells. ""The objective of EoI is to assess the interest level of potential partners (E&P companies, service providers and technology players) to join as partners to carry out revised field development plan,"" it said.

ONGC holds 100 per cent interest in KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block in the Krishna Godavari basin. The block sits next to Reliance Industries' KG-D6 area. The block, ONGC said, has three sets of discoveries – Cluster-I in the northern part, Cluster-II and Cluster-III in the southern part.

ONGC is developing oil and gas discoveries in Cluster II on its own. Oil production is likely to start by end of the year and gas by May 2023. ""In the year 2006, the well UD-1 made a Miocene biogenic gas discovery at ultradeep water depths,"" it said in the tender document adding five out of the seven appraisal wells drilled have confirmed the consistent presence of 60 metres of gas-bearing sands.

Currently, ONGC is engaged in the preparation of the Field Development Plan. ""Considering the inherent knowledge, cost and technology challenges associated with the field, ONGC would like to seek technical expertise to firm up a way forward for future development of UD deepwater portfolio,"" it said.",608,0.3382374048233032

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has won 18 out of the 21 areas offered for finding and producing oil and gas in the sixth bid round under Open Acreage Licensing Policy, according to the upstream regulator DGH.

Oil India Ltd (OIL) walked away with two blocks and Sun Petrochemicals Pvt Ltd got one block, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons said announcing the winners of the OALP-VI round.

The 21 blocks or areas offered for exploration and production of oil and gas in Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) Bid Round-VI attracted just 3 bidders at the close of bidding on October 6, 2021.

Of the 21 blocks on offer, 18 got a single bid and the remaining 3 blocks had two bidders.

ONGC, India’s largest oil producer, had bid for 19 blocks while OIL bid for two.

ONGC was the sole bidder in 16 blocks and OIL was the only bidder in the two areas it sought for.

Sun Petrochemicals bid for three blocks, where it is locked in competition with ONGC.

Vedanta Ltd and Reliance-BP combine, which had bid in previous rounds of OALP, did not bid in the current round.

The government has been hoping that opening up of more acreage for exploration will help boost India’s oil and gas production, helping cut down the USD 119 billion oil import bill.

In 2016, it brought in an open acreage policy which moved away from the previous practice of government identifying and bidding out blocks to one where explorers were allowed the freedom to identify any area outside of the ones that are already with some company or other, for prospecting of oil and gas.

The areas identified are to be clubbed twice a year and offered for bidding.

The firm identifying the area gets a 5-point advantage.

But except for the first round, private sector participation has been scant. Mining mogul Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd walked away with 41 blocks out of the 55 blocks on offer in the very first round and got another 10 areas in two subsequent rounds.

Other rounds have been dominated by state-owned firms.

OALP-VII round, bids for which closed in February this year, saw four companies, including three state-owned, put in 10 bids for the eight oil and gas blocks.

Six blocks got single bids. India is 85 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs and finding newer reserves through exploration rounds is key to cutting that reliance.

India is 85 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs and finding newer reserves through exploration rounds is key to cutting that reliance.

In the previous five OALP bid rounds, 105 blocks for exploration of oil and gas were bid for. Of these, Vedanta Ltd walked away with 51. OIL won 25 and ONGC another 24.

The joint venture of Reliance Industries and BP got one block. Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), GAIL, BRPL and HOEC too got one block each.

The 105 blocks spanning an area of around 156,580 square kilometers in over 17 Sedimentary Basins of India attracted a total committed investment of around USD 2.378 billion in the exploration phase.

The 21 OALP-VI blocks are spread over 11 Sedimentary Basins, 9 states covering 35,346 sq km of area. Of these, 15 blocks are onland, 4 in shallow waters and two in ultra-deepwater.

At the time of the launch of OALP-VI in August 2021, the government had said it is expecting a USD 300-400 million investment commitment in the exploration of oil and gas through the round.

Under OALP, blocks in Category-I basins are awarded to a company offering the highest share of the revenue from oil and gas produced.

Those in Category II and III are bid out to those offering maximum exploration or investment commitment.

Category-I basins have established reserves and fields that are already producing while Category-II basins are the ones that have contingent resources pending commercial production.

Category-III basins are the ones that have prospective resources awaiting discovery.

In OALP-VI, 12 blocks lie in Category-I basins while 4 are in Category-II and the remaining 5 in Category-III.

ONGC won 9 Category-1 basin blocks, OIL got two and Sun won one block, according to the list of winners put out by the DGH.

Features of the OALP round include reduced royalty rates, no oil cess, a uniform licensing system, marketing and pricing freedom and a revenue-sharing model, according to DGH.

Exploration rights are offered on all retained areas for full contract life, it said adding concessional royalty rates apply in case of early commercial production.

There is no revenue sharing in blocks falling in Category II and III Basins except in the case of windfall gains.",785,0.9999986092249552

The Congress on Sunday raised questions over the deal to sale Centre’s 51 per cent stake in helicopter services provider Pawan Hans Ltd (PHL), asking why the government did not explore merging the firm with ONGC instead of deciding to hand it over to a consortium that is just six-months-old.

The Finance Ministry on Friday said Star9 Mobility Pvt Ltd will buy the government’s 51 per cent stake in helicopter services provider Pawan Hans Ltd (PHL), along with the transfer of management control, for Rs 211.14 crore.

The reserve price for the strategic sale, which comes after three unsuccessful attempts, was fixed at Rs 199.92 crore based on the valuation carried out by the transaction adviser and asset valuer.

Attacking the government over the decision, Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said that in the series of miscalculated and injudicious disinvestment decisions to justify their financial policies, “they are committing a series of blunders”. The reserve price for the sale of this 51 per cent majority stake was fixed at Rs 199.92 crores and the other two bidders that participated made bids of Rs 181.05 crore and Rs 153.15 crore respectively, Vallabh pointed out.

Vallabh said while this may seem like a normal disinvestment, there are several things that raise eyebrows such as the the Star9 Mobility Private Ltd, a consortium of Big Charter Private Limited, Maharaja Aviation Private Limited and Almas Global Opportunity Fund SPC, set-up just six months ago on October 29, 2021.

Star9 Mobility Private Ltd doesn’t have any helicopters of its own while Big Charter Private Limited has just 3 helicopters in its fleet, he said. Also, Almas Global Opportunity Fund SPC is set up under the jurisdiction of Cayman Islands and has no correlation or experience in this sector, he said.

Vallabh also claimed that there is a court case ongoing between Big Charter Private Limited and Ezen Aviation Private Limited in the Delhi High court He pointed out that Pawan Hans employee union expressed interest in participating in the disinvestment process and had also recommended that Pawan Hans be merged with ONGC or made a subsidiary company but the government “brushed it off”.

“Pawan Hans made a net profit of Rs. 242.78 crore in 2016-17 but has gone downhill since 2018-19 making losses of Rs 63.67 crores in 2018-19 and Rs 33.15 crores in 2019-20,” he said.

Posing questions for the Modi Government over the decision, Vallabh said that with details available about the bidders and their consortium there are red flags, and how did the government agree to such a deal.

“There were three bidders that participated in the disinvestment process but only one bidder bid over the reserve price. What was the government’s reason to go ahead with just one proper bid?” Vallabh said.

Did the government explore merging Pawan Hans with ONGC, keeping in mind they already have 49 per cent stake and Pawan Hans playing a very strategic role with ONGC, HAL etc., he asked.

Pointing out that a company that has been consistently making net profits suddenly starts making losses since 2018-19 around the same time when the disinvestment was first processed, Vallabh asked is this again an attempt to lower the valuation to ease sale to someone who would benefit.

Vallabh pointed out that Pawan Hans is South-East Asia’s largest helicopter company with a fleet of 42 Helicopters Off shore operations, connecting inaccessible areas, charter services, search and rescue work, VIP transportation, corporate and special charter flights, hotline washing of insulators and Heli-pilgrims such to Kedarnath, Badrinath, Amartnath, Maa Vaishno Devi, are some of its major services Loss-making PHL is a 51:49 joint venture of the government and ONGC. ONGC had earlier decided to offer its entire shareholding to the successful bidder identified in the government strategic disinvestment transaction, on the same price and terms as the government.

The government in December last year received three financial bids for buying the company.

Vallabh accused the BJP of inept handling of the economy and said after eight years of disastrous financial management, the economy is reeling.

The BJP government has forced sectors to the end of their tethers that needed support and have magically made good companies and sectors struggle, he alleged.

They are violating all prudence and common logic to find a way out of the financial mismanagement caused in the last 8 years, Vallabh said.

Pawan Hans has been incurring losses in the last three years (FY-19, FY-20 and FY-21). It has a fleet of 42 helicopters of which 41 are owned by the company.

The owned helicopters have an average age of over 20 years and three-fourths of them are presently not being manufactured by the original equipment manufacturer.",791,-0.9740544259548187

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has commissioned two projects costing Rs 6,000 crore to add 7.5 million tonnes of oil production and 1 billion cubic meters of gas output over the life of the Mumbai High fields, as it doubles down efforts to raise productivity from mature and aging fields.

A Rs 3,740-crore spend has been made on a state-of-the-art 8-legged water injection-cum-living quarter platform, as part of the Mumbai High South Redevelopment Phase-IV, while Rs 2,292.46 crore have been spent on Cluster-8 marginal field development project at Mumbai High, the company said in a statement.

""The two projects will result in an incremental gain of 7.5 million tonnes of oil and more than 1 BCM of gas,"" it said. Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri dedicated the two major projects to the nation at Western offshore on April 23. He was accompanied by chairman Alka Mittal, Director (T&FS) O P Singh and Director (Offshore) Pankaj Kumar.

""The minister expressed his appreciation for the ONGC team for implementing the two projects. He exhorted ONGC to further enhance their efforts to add more oil and gas to the kitty of nations, adopting accelerated exploration activities,"" the statement said.

The state-of-the-art 8-legged water Injection-cum-Living Quarter platform has been installed as part of implementation of low salinity water flood (LSWF) process, an Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) pilot project, part of the Mumbai High South Redevelopment phase IV at a total capex of Rs 3,740 crore.

The project will result in incremental gain of 3.20 million tonnes of oil and 0.571 BCM of gas. ""This is the first EOR project of Indian offshore. The concept involves reducing the salinity of the injected sea water, which is about 28000 ppm, up to the level of 8250 ppm with a desalination plant.

""The mechanism of LSWF involves complex Crude Oil-Brine-Rock (COBR) interactions for improving both microscopic and macroscopic displacement efficiency,"" it said.

The project has been implemented with strategic emphasis on local procurement of Rs 1,700 crore, in line with the Make in India Initiative of the government. Out of a total 45 major Pumps/packages in the project, 42 major pump packages have been manufactured in India. 40,000 tonnes of structural steel, enough to make 5 Eiffel Towers have been used in the structure.

The Energy Recovery Unit to save power will result in reducing 8314 MT of C02 emission yearly, there by reducing carbon footprint. The cluster 8 Marginal Field development project at Mumbai High has been implemented with a total cost of Rs 2,292.46 crore. The project will result in incremental production of 4.38 million tonnes of oil and 0.464 BCM of gas.

These marginal fields were discovered in 2017-18 and 2018-19. The CO2 mitigation system has been implemented for the first time in offshore, as part of the project.

In a bonanza for gas producers, Reliance Industries is set to get a record price of around $10 per MMBtu for the KG gas, while state-owned ONGC is likely to fetch more than double the rate for its Mumbai High and other fields, sources said.

The government-dictated price for natural gas produced in the country is to be revised on April 1 and factoring in the spike in energy prices witnessed last year, the rate paid for gas produced from fields given to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on nomination basis is likely to rise to $5.93 per million British thermal units from current $2.9.

Simultaneously, difficult fields like the ones in Reliance and its partner bp plc operated D6 block in KG basin, are likely to get $9.9-10.1 price compared to the current rate of $6.13, two sources aware of the matter said.

These are the highest rates for administered/regulated fields (like ONGC’s Bassein field off the Mumbai coast) and free-market areas (such as the KG basin).

Also, this will be the second increase in rates since April 2019 and comes on the back of firming benchmark international prices.

The government sets the price of gas every six months — on April 1 and October 1 — each year based on rates prevalent in gas surplus nations such as the US, Canada and Russia in one year with a lag of one quarter.

So, the price for April 1 to September 30 is based on the average price from January 2021 to December 2021.

This is the period when global rates shot through the roofs.

The volume-weighted average of the price prevalent in a 12-month period in US-based Henry Hub, Canada-based Alberta gas, UK-based NBP and Russia gas are used to fix price for administered fields of ONGC and Oil India Ltd.

For difficult fields like discoveries in deepwater, ultra-deepwater and high pressure-high temperature areas, a slightly modified formula is used by incorporating the price of LNG, which too had shot through the roof in 2021.

Reliance-bp operated KG fields are classified as difficult fields.

The sources said the increase in gas price is likely to result in a rise in CNG and piped cooking gas rates in cities, such as Delhi and Mumbai.

It will also lead to a rise in the cost of generating electricity but consumers may not feel any major pinch as the share of power produced from gas is very low.

Similarly, the cost of producing fertiliser will also go up but as the government subsidises the crop nutrient, an increase in rates is unlikely.

For producers, this will be the first time in six years that they will get a remunerative price.

ONGC had been incurring losses on the 65 million standard cubic meters per day of gas it produces from domestic fields shortly after the government in November 2014 introduced a new gas pricing formula that had ""inherent limitations” as it was based on pricing hubs of gas surplus countries such as the US, Canada, and Russia.

The sources said ONGC had in several communications to the government has stated that the break-even price to produce gas from new discoveries was in the range of $5-9 per MMBtu and that for old fields such as Mumbai High and Bassein is about $3.6-3.7.

The Congress-led UPA had approved a new pricing formula for implementation in 2014 that would have raised the rates, but the BJP-led government scrapped it and brought a new formula.

The new formula takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (the UK), Alberta (Canada), and Russia with a lag of one-quarter.

The rate at the first revision, using the new formula, came to $5.05 but in the subsequent six-monthly reviews kept falling till it touched $2.48 for April 2017 to September 2017 period.

Subsequently, it rose to $3.69 in April 2019-September 2019 before being cut in subsequent rounds to $1.79.

ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp, has a stake in Russia's Sakhalin-1 project and sells its share of the oil from the project through tenders.

In the tender earlier in March, ONGC Videsh did not get any bids for the Sokol crude oil cargo for May loading.

The sources said HPCL and BPCL had been able to offer a discounted price for the cargo. This marks the first purchase of Sokol crude by HPCL. BPCL had previously purchased the grade in 2016.

One of the sources said ONGC Videsh will look at selling more cargos to Indian refiners if there is no interest from overseas buyers.

ONGC Videsh, HPCL and BPCL did not respond to Reuters emails seeking comment.

India’s largest crude oil and natural gas company, the state-run ONGC, is undertaking various steps to increase production, supported by the government’s policy initiatives for increasing production of oil and natural gas, said the minister of state for petroleum and natural gas Rameswar Teli.

In a written reply to Rajya Sabha on March 28, the minister said that the government has also provided functional freedom to national oil companies and has encouraged wider private sector participation.

“The decline in production of crude oil in recent years has been due to natural decline and increase in water cut in wells of matured fields. ONGC is undertaking various steps to increase the production by the redevelopment of existing matured fields and development of new/marginal fields,” the minister said.

The steps include development of discoveries in Krishna Godavari Basin, monetisation of discoveries in the nomination and New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) blocks, integrated development of fields, production enhancement contract in small fields, up-gradation/replacement of surface facilities etc. Un-viable small and marginal fields are developed through the cluster development concept.

ONGC is also inducting technology for improved oil recovery and enhanced oil recovery technologies for enhancing the recovery factor of matured fields.

ONGC’s crude oil production has gradually declined to 20.273 million metric tonnes (MMT) in 2020-21 from 20.273 MMT in 2016-17. In the same period, the company’s natural gas production declined to 22.096 billion cubic metres (BCM) in FY 21 from 22.088 in FY17.

India lost 3.8 million tonnes of crude oil worth Rs 11,276 crore in four years due to less than planned water injection by ONGC in its western offshore fields, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) said.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation’s (ONGC) aging Mumbai High, Neelam and Heera fields off the Mumbai coast have been on a decline and water is injected into wells to push out the remaining oil.

""There was inadequate water injection,” the CAG said in a report tabled in Parliament on Thursday.

""Water injection in the field was affected due to aging of injection infrastructure, frequent pipeline leakages due to poor quality of injection water, non-implementation of feasibility report inputs and to some extent, production from high gas-oil ratio wells.”

This led to drop in reservoir pressure sharply and impacted crude oil production.

""…this deficient water injection impacted loss of production of crude worth Rs 7,802.50 crore for ONGC and revenue loss of Rs 3,474.29 crore to the Government of India by way of statutory levies during the audit period (2014-15 to 2018-19),” it said.

CAG said this loss cannot be considered as deferred production but a permanent loss of oil.

""Further, even for exploitation of a part of this oil deficit, additional investment is required and this needs review from the point of economical oil recovery,” it said.

Mumbai High, Neelam and Heera fields contribute around 59 per cent of ONGC’s production.

The mature fields, which have been operating from 1976 and 1984 respectively, are susceptible to decline in production.

CAG said the shortfall in water injection is one of the significant reasons for less production of crude oil. CAG said the shortfall in water injection is one of the significant reasons for less production of crude oil.

The crude that could not be produced due to lesser water injection was 3.79 million tonnes during the audit period.

""The value of oil deficit of 3.79 million tonnes due to less water injection worked out to Rs 11,276.79 crore. Out of this, the value of the oil deficit was Rs 7,802.50 crore for ONGC after considering the statutory levies and the balance Rs 3,474.29 crore is revenue loss to the Government of India,” it said.

CAG said there was a continuous decline in reservoir pressure due to inadequate water injection since the inception of fields which impacted crude oil productivity and its ultimate recovery.

""Decline in reservoir pressure is further accentuated by higher gas production from the reservoir,” it said.

""Periodic recommendations of the (Oil) Ministry on importance of water injection, its distribution and maintenance of reservoir health were not fully implemented.”

ONGC’s Performance Benchmarking Group did not benchmark key performance indicators of 'reservoir health' with the world’s leading exploration and production companies.

""Instead, it fixed static targets based on inputs received from its strategic business units. Further, effective 2019-20, the parameter ’reservoir health’ is not part of the performance contract indicating lack of monitoring of reservoir health by the management,” it said.

Indian companies’ value of investments in Russia’s oil and gas fields could be impaired as import bans and international sanctions may constraint future cash flow generating capacity, Moody’s Investors Service said Thursday.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Oil India Ltd (OIL), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) have invested in upstream oil and gas assets in Russia.

""Import bans and international sanctions on Russia may constrain the future cash flow generating capacity of these assets and lead to impairment losses for the companies,” the rating agency said in a note.

Follow our LIVE blog on Russia-Ukraine conflict

While multinationals like BP and Shell have announced withdrawal from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, Indian companies have not announced an exit from their Russian investments.

This, Moody’s said, will lead to a limited impairment in the value of investments immediately, especially under the current oil price environment.

Indian firms have invested USD 16 billion in Russian assets such as the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field in the far east.

Moody’s said they may face hurdles in receiving dividend payments but the impact on earnings will not be significant.

""If an increasing number of Russian banks are excluded from the main financial messaging SWIFT system, Indian companies might not be able to receive future dividends from their upstream investments in Russia.""

""However, even in a situation where the companies cannot access these cash flows, the impact on their financial profiles will not be significant,” it said.

For most companies, dividend income from the Russian investments constitutes less than 5-6 per cent of consolidated EBITDA.

The US ban on the import of Russian oil and other international sanctions on Russia may constrain the future cash flow generating capacity of these assets.

Such developments would lower the value of the Indian companies’ investments and will likely result in impairment losses.

For IOC and BPCL, the Russian assets accounted for less than 5 per cent of their total asset bases as of December 31, 2021.

The two firms receive earnings contributions from these assets in the form of dividends.

For ONGC, its Russian assets accounted for around 12 per cent and 20 per cent of its production volumes and proved reserves, respectively, for FY2021.

For OIL, these proportions stood at around 31 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively.

For ONGC, the Russian assets contributed to around 11 per cent of its consolidated EBITDA for FY2021.

Around 8 per cent of this contribution came from the Sakhalin-1 project while the balance was in the form of dividends by CJSC Vankorneft.

""Even if ONGC loses its entire earnings contribution from the Russian assets, the impact can be accommodated into ONGC’s credit profile,” Moody’s said.

A similar situation for IOC and BPCL would not have any material impact on their financial profiles as dividend income from the Russian investments accounted for just around 2-4 per cent of their consolidated EBITDA for the fiscal ended March 2021 (FY2021).",497,-0.9784657103674752

On the indicator front, the relative strength index (RSI) plotted on weekly has witnessed a range shift and is sustaining above the 50 mark since January 2021.

Traders and investors should continue holding the stock and can expect upside towards Rs 195. A break above of Rs 195 will increase the momentum to take prices towards Rs 210 levels. Downside support for the stock is now placed at Rs 175 level.

HEG

On mid term charts, HEG is moving with lower highs and lows formation. The stock has corrected more than 50 percent after making a high of Rs 2,629.

In Monday's session, the stock has shown relative outperformance and gained 13 percent irrespective of the weakness in the market. The RSI on weekly scale has dipped below the 40 mark.

Traders and investors should use the up move towards Rs 1,400-1,450 to exit for the stock.

Sheela Foam

On long term charts, Sheela Foam is moving in an uptrend and the stock has been taking support at its 20-week SMA (Rs 3,235) throughout its up move.

The stock has shown relative strength and is trading very close to its life highs. The RSI indicator has witnessed a range shift and is sustaining above the 50 mark since January 2021.

One can continue holding the stock has expect it to move higher towards Rs 3,950 followed by Rs 4,240 levels. Downside support for the stock is now placed at Rs 3,250 level.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises

Shares of Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) rose as much as 3.4 percent on March 3 as global crude oil prices continued their ascent to hit their highest level in eight years.

Brent crude oil futures soared past the $118-mark and were up nearly 3 percent as the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia showed no signs of easing. The sanctions imposed on the Russian economy by members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation have led to concerns of the country’s oil exports being cut-off.

Brokerage firm TD Securities suggested that oil prices could hit $145 per barrel in the coming weeks while Morgan Stanley sees the commodity rising to $125 per barrel due to the ongoing Ukraine crisis.

The surge in oil prices is immensely beneficial for ONGC with analysts expecting a 2 percent jump in valuations of the company for every $1 per barrel rise in crude oil prices. Shares of the company have risen 17 percent so far this year.

Besides oil, ONGC also benefits from the rise in global natural gas prices given that a large share of the company’s revenues are generated through sale of gas. Analysts expect the surge in global natural gas prices to result in a more than doubling of domestic prices when the rates are rejigged in April.

In September, the government had raised natural gas prices by 62 percent for the first time in two years to $2.9 mmBtu tracking the rise in global natural gas prices.

The biggest rally in shares of Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in more than 11 months in January prompted ICICI Value Discovery Fund to trim holding.

Shares of the oil producer rallied around 21 percent last month on the back of a 15 percent surge in global crude oil prices during the period to a seven-year high aided by rising geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and increasing global demand.

Oil has been on the boil in the past few months as the receding threat of the COVID-19 pandemic has seen demand for the commodity surge amid inadequate supplies due to the low spare capacity of Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

According to analysts, a $1 per barrel rise in crude oil prices translated to a roughly two percent increase in the valuation of ONGC. In the quarter ended December, the firm reported better-than-expected growth of 220 percent on-year in consolidated net profit on the back of higher crude oil realisations.

That said, ICICI Value Discovery Fund was net seller of the stock in January as it offloaded 74.8 million shares worth more than Rs 1,200 crore, data compiled by Prime Database showed. In terms of value, ONGC was the biggest sale made by ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund in January.

At the end of the December quarter, mutual funds held a 6.19 percent stake in the oil and gas producer, of which 2.86 percent stake was held by ICICI Prudential Value Discovery Fund.

ICICI Prudential’s move to book profits stands in contrast to the rest of the mutual fund schemes, which were net buyers to the tune of Rs 150 crore in the stock.

Overall, brokerages have expressed optimism on the company amid higher global crude oil prices. Edelweiss Securities retained its “buy” rating on the stock after the December quarter earnings were announced as it sees ONGC as a cyclical play.

“It continues to disappoint on production, but rising prices more than offset in the near term. We are concerned about falling OPEC+ surpluses and geopolitical concerns, and hike FY23 oil price by 13% to $75/bbl,” Edelweiss said in a note earlier this week.

JM Financial Services highlighted that higher oil prices are not the only trigger for ONGC. The brokerage firm expects domestic gas prices to rise to $6.5 per mmBtu in the first half of 2022-23 and $9 per mmBtu in the second half of FY23.

Currently, the domestic administered price for natural gas is $2.9 per mmBtu and if JM Financial’s forecast plays out, ONGC’s valuation could swell further by 19 percent going ahead.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation doesn’t see crude oil prices falling below $70 any time soon, a top company official said.

“Crude oil prices are not expected to come below $65-70/bbl for the next one year,” Rajesh Kumar Srivastava, director-exploration at ONGC, said in an exclusive interview to CNBC TV18 on February 16.

ONGC revised its net oil realisation target 4 percent upwards to $75.6 per barrel for FY22 from $72.6 per barrel earlier, the state-owned company said while announcing its results for the quarter ended December.

Rising crude oil and gas prices are a positive for ONGC and current oil prices are way above the breakeven level for the company, Srivastava said. Brent crude futures, an international benchmark, traded at $93.19 a barrel on February 16.

ONGC expects realisations for the current quarter at similar levels as in the third quarter of FY22. Crude oil realisations for FY23 are expected to be $65-70 a barrel.

The company said production levels for both oil and natural gas will grow from FY23 once the output starts from the KG Basin in December 2022.

“Production from the basin will reach its peak from FY24 onwards with 45,000 barrels per day of oil production and around 8-10 mmscmd (million metric standard cubic metres per day) of gas,” Srivastava added.

Enhanced output

During the Q3 results conference call, company officials highlighted a short-term production enhancement plan designed with the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas wherein it set output targets of 60 mmtoe/63.1 mmtoe (million metric tonnes of oil equivalent) for FY24/FY25.

The major thrust is targeted from the east coast (KG 98/2) where a third well has been completed and the company hopes to produce 1.75 mmscmd of gas by March 2022. Production from the well is expected to peak from FY23-24, with 10.41 mmscmd of gas and 45,000 bpd of oil.

The company also highlighted its other major projects, including Mumbai High South Redevelopment Phase 4, which is 88 percent complete; Cluster 8, which is 94 percent complete; Mumbai High North Redevelopment Phase 4, which is 53 percent complete, and Heera RD project, which is 78 percent complete.

The capital expenditure on exploration would be about Rs 10,000 crore in FY23, Srivastava said. He expects spending on exploration to reach Rs 40,000-45,000 crore in the next three-four years.

ONGC beat analyst estimates when it reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 11,637 crore for the three months ended December, a more than threefold increase from Rs 3,637 crore a year earlier. On a sequential basis, profit fell 38 percent from Rs 18,749 crore.

The company received a deferred and current tax credit of Rs 9,320 crore in the preceding quarter of the current financial year. Adjusting for the tax credit, profit for the reported quarter is 23 percent higher on a sequential basis.

Consolidated revenue for the quarter rose to Rs 1.46 lakh crore from Rs 1 lakh crore a year ago and Rs 1.22 lakh crore in the preceding quarter.

India’s largest crude oil and natural gas company, the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) aims to arrest the decline in production of oil and gas and scale it up gradually to 63.11 million metric tonnes oil equivalent (MMTOE) from 58 MMTOE in FY21, company’s management told investors in a call on February 14.

ONGC, which contributes around 71 percent to India’s domestic production, has reported a gradual decline in output for over a decade now. The government has considered giving away ONGC's biggest oil and gas fields to private and foreign companies in an attempt to boost output but this has faced resistance from the officers' union of the company.

“ONGC, along with the ministry of petroleum, has already drawn an action plan which includes a short term plan and goes upto 2024-25; under this plan we have set enhanced production targets. We have already submitted the plan and we are in the process of implementing this production action plan,” Anurag Sharma, director - onshore, said in an investors’ conference call. He also holds the additional charge of director of finance.

The company expects that ONGC, along with subsidiaries and joint ventures, will scale up production to 60 MMTOE by FY24, and 63.11 MMTOE by FY25.

“There will be a smooth progression in production starting with 2021-22,” Sharma said.

On February 12, ONGC said that in the nine months ended December, its crude oil production declined 3.9% to 16.32 million metric tonnes (MMT). In the same period, its gas output declined 5.2% to 16.340 billion cubic meters (BCM). The company attributed the decline this year to restrictive conditions created by the Tauktae cyclone and Covid, delay in mobilization of Mobile Offshore Production Unit (MOPU) Sagar Samrat to Western Offshore-16 cluster project, modification work at Hazira and reservoir issues in S1 Vashistha fields in Eastern Offshore.

Shares of ONGC touched a 52-week high of Rs 176.40 on BSE on February 14, driven by the result declared on February 12. The company’s consolidated profit after tax was Rs 11,637 crore for the third quarter of FY22, up 220 percent, as higher oil and gas prices offset the impact of a decline in production.

Brokerage JM Financials said in a report that it reiterates its ‘buy’ rating on shares of ONGC, with a price target of Rs 230 a share. “ONGC is a key beneficiary of higher crude prices; every $1/barrel rise in crude price results in our valuation rising by around 2%. Further, ONGC is also a major beneficiary of the potential sharp jump in domestic gas price in FY23 given the spike in global gas prices,” the brokerage said in a report dated February 12. .

Capex

ONGC said that it will continue to invest around Rs 30,000 crore per year on capital expenditure aimed at arresting the decline in output and subsequently increasing it.

“Our capital expenditure has been in the range of Rs 30,000 crore (per year), which we have been maintaining for about five years. The action plan that we are now implementing demands capital expenditure of at least the same amount if not more,” Sharma said.

While he did not quantify the possible increase in capex, he said that the company will revise it if there are new opportunities, particularly from Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) bids.

Gas Pricing

The company’s inability to pass on the burden of rising cost of gas has been weighing on ONGC. The management said that even after the revision of the APM (Administered Pricing Mechanism) formula based price to $2.9 per million British thermal units (mBtu) October 2021-March 2022 period from $1.79 per mBtu earlier, it was “barely enough” to meet production cost.

The management said it has sought pricing and marketing freedom from the government.

Mozambique Force Majeur

ONGC is unlikely to re-start work at its liquified natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique unless all issues around the project are resolved. The $20 billion-project, where Indian firms own 30% stake with ONGC accounting for 16% interest, halted work indefinitely as violence in the area escalated.

Commenting on the impact of the halt on Mozambique project on ONGC Videsh’s output, the latter's General Manager Nirmal Kumar said, “Our gas production will lag and our prediction continue to be for the next two years around 12.5 MMTOE, before it goes up further with Mozambique production.”

ONGC’s overseas consortium ONGC Videsh consortium put the Mozambique project on hold in April 2021 due to force majeure amidst security concerns in the north of the Cabo Delgado province.

“We cannot start operations to stop it again. We are hopeful that going forward in 2022, we would be in a position to resume operations. But the force majeure, as declared by the operator, will impact the production by a year,” Kumar said.",832,-0.24318251284686002

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is expected to witness more than 500 percent increase in its standalone profit after tax (PAT) compared to last year and standalone revenues are expected to grow by 65 percent on-year supported by higher crude and gas prices partially negated by the decline in volumes.

On a quarterly basis, adjusted PAT is expected to decline by 4 percent and revenues may improve by 15 percent, experts said.

The state-owned oil and gas exploration and production company is scheduled to announce its results for the quarter ended December 2021 later in the day today.

The company had reported a standalone PAT of Rs 1,378 crore in the corresponding period a year ago, with revenues of Rs 17,024 crore. In the previous quarter of this fiscal, the PAT for the company stood at Rs 18,348 crore with revenues at Rs 24,354 crore. The company had received a deferred and current tax credit of Rs 8,686 crore.

Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities expect the company to report 65 percent on-year growth in revenues to Rs 28,052 crore. On a sequential basis, the revenues may grow by 15 percent.

EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) is likely to grow 88 percent on-year and 18.4 percent quarter on quarter to Rs 15,662 crore.

“We expect 18 percent increase in EBITDA led by (1) higher crude realization at USD 75/bbl (higher by USD 6/bbl QoQ), (2) a sharp sequential rise in domestic gas price to USD 3.2/mn BTU from USD 2/mn BTU in the previous quarter and (3) higher price of value-added products,” the brokerage said in its report.

It expects the overall crude oil sales volumes to decline 4 percent on-year to 5.1 million tons and natural gas sales volumes to decline 4 percent on-year to 4.4 bcm (billion cubic meters), which is broadly in line with the recent production trends.

Basis this, EBITDA margins are likely to expand 680 bps to 55.8 percent for the quarter from 49 percent in the same quarter a year ago. Compared to the previous quarter, the EBITDA margins are likely to improve by 152 bps.

Kotak expects PAT of Rs 8,821 crore at a year on year growth of 540 percent. Adjusting for the deferred tax credit in the previous quarter, the profit is likely to grow by 2 percent quarter on quarter.

According to a report from Motilal Oswal Financial Services, the revenue for the quarter is expected to increase by 67.5 percent on-year to Rs 28,514 crore.

The brokerage expects “net realizations to grow ~78 percent on year and ~11 percent on quarter, led by an increase in crude oil prices”. Oil sales are likely to decline by 4 percent on-year but improve 2 percent quarter on quarter while gas sales are expected to decline 6 percent on-year and remain flat quarter on quarter.

Gas production from the KG basin remains crucial as any further delay could dampen near-term sentiment.

EBITDA margins for the quarter are likely at 55.1 percent with an EBITDA of 15,720 crore. The margins are seen improving by 610 bps year on year and 80 bps on quarter.

PAT is expected at Rs 8,190 crore which is a growth of 550 percent from the profit reported in the same period last year. After adjusting for deferred tax credit received in the previous quarter, the profit is seen declining by 3.5 percent on a sequential basis.

ONGC closed at Rs 169.1, up Rs 5.15 (+3.14 percent) from its previous close at the National Stock Exchange on February 10. The stock has generated returns of 69 percent during the past one year and is trading up by 7 percent in the past one month.",630,0.45787932191576275

The market gained for the third consecutive session backed by dovish RBI policy and positive global cues on Thursday. The Nifty50 closed a tad above the 17,600 mark with 142 points gain, while the BSE Sensex climbed over 58,900 levels, with 460 points rise.

Sectors like banking and financials, IT, metals and select FMCG stocks supported the market. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices also became a part of the momentum, rising third of a percent and half a percent, respectively.

Stocks that were in focus include Jindal Steel & Power which was the biggest gainer in the futures and options segment, rising 5.86 percent to Rs 440.90, and ONGC which was the top gainer in the Nifty50, climbing 3.14 percent to Rs 169.10, while Radico Khaitan was up 5.36 percent to close at Rs 958.15.

Here's what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Jindal Steel & Power

In this month so far, the stock has rallied over 17 percent. On Thursday, the stock opened with a strong note and successfully cleared the resistance of Rs 430.

On short term time frame, the stock has formed strong price volume breakout pattern. The texture of the pattern suggests breakout action will continue in the near term if stock succeeds to trade above Rs 425 level.

For the swing traders, Rs 425 would be the sacrosanct level, and trading above the same we can expect uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 450-470.

ONGC

Post strong uptrend rally from Rs 135 to Rs 170, the stock is witnessing narrow range activity. However, on daily charts stock has maintained uptrend formation and consistently trading above short term averages which is broadly positive.

In addition, on daily charts, stock has formed bullish candle reversal formation near 20-day SMA (simple moving average) which indicates high chances of fresh uptrend from current levels.

In short run, Rs 164 or 20-day SMA would be the key level to watch. If stock manages to trade above the same then we can expect uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 177-185.

Radico Khaitan

From the level of Rs 1,275, the stock is witnessed medium term price correction. The stock corrected nearly 30 percent from the level of Rs 1,275. After a sharp fall, finally it took support near 200-day SMA and reversed sharply.

Momentum indicators and reversal formation indicating strong possibility of quick pullback rally, if it succeeds to trade above 200 day SMA or Rs 900 support level.

For the positional traders, Rs 900 would act as a trend decider support level. Above which, the pullback rally will continue up to Rs 1,000-1,050.

Most board level appointments at public sector companies are done on the basis of recommendations of the Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB) but the government headhunter did not find anyone suitable among nine candidates, including two serving IAS officers, to head ONGC.

""Keeping in view the strategic importance and vision for the company and its future, the Board did not recommend any candidate and decided to constitute a search committee,” PESB had said in a notice after interviews on June 5, 2021.

The panel was constituted after eight months of that recommendation on February 4.

""The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) has approved selection to the post through a search-cum-selection committee,” an official order said.

The panel will comprise chairperson of PESB, oil secretary, and B Ashok, former chairman of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), it said adding Ashok is the outside expert on the panel.

The ACC also approved ""consideration of central government officers including those of the armed forces of the Union and the All India Services for the post on an immediate absorption basis"".

As per the practice, PESB recommends a name for a board level position at least 3 months prior to arising of the vacancy.

However, in the case of ONGC, PESB advertised and interviewed candidates after the retirement of Shashi Shanker on March 31, 2021.

As per the practice, PESB recommends a name for a board level position at least 3 months prior to arising of the vacancy.

The committee route for appointment of PSU board members has very sparingly been used in the past.

In 2016, current NTPC chairman Gurdeep Singh was appointed through the route.

Last appointment using the route was that of Sanjeev Kumar as the chairman of Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL).

PESB had on June 5, 2021, interviewed nine out of the 10 candidates who had applied for the post of Chairman and Managing Director of ONGC.

Those interviewed included senior bureaucrats Avinash Joshi and Niraj Verma.

Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) director-finance Pomila Jaspal and ONGC director for technology and field services Om Prakash Singh were the other prominent names who were interviewed, as per the PESB notice.

Both the bureaucrats are from the 1994 batch of IAS officers belonging to the Assam-Meghalaya cadre.

Others interviewed by PESB were ONGC executive directors Sandeep Gupta, Pankaj Kumar and Omkar Nath Gyani, ONGC additional director general Anand Gupta, and Container Corporation of India director-finance Manoj Kumar Dubey.

Security Printing and Minting Corp of India Ltd director-finance Ajay Agarwal, who had applied for the job, did not appear for the interview.

This is the second time in one-and-a-half decades that a suitable candidate was not found among those who had applied.

In August 2006, PESB chose R S Sharma to head the company but the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) in February 2007 vetoed his appointment as it wanted the selection process to be widened by inviting candidates from the private sector.

In June 2007, PESB again selected Sharma and his candidature was this time endorsed by the Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC).

While a replacement to the PSU board position is often selected before the incumbent retires, PESB did not hold any interviews for almost seven months as its chairman wasn’t appointed.

The government in April 2021 named Mallika Srinivasan, chairman and managing director of Tractors and Farm Equipment (TAFE) Ltd, as the new chairperson of PESB.

She is the first person from the private sector to be appointed as the head of PESB.

After Shanker retired, Subhash Kumar, director for finance and senior most director on ONGC board, was given the additional charge of chairman and managing director.

Kumar retired on December 31, 2021 and Alka Mittal, Director for Human Resources, ONGC, was given additional charge. She will superannuate in August.

State-owned oil firms such as ONGC and IOC will invest over Rs 1.11 lakh crore in the next fiscal year starting April as they supplement the government’s massive spending programme to spur economic growth.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), GAIL (India) Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) will together make a 7.4 per cent higher capital expenditure in the 2022-23 fiscal (FY23).

Follow our LIVE blog on Union Budget 2022

The capex spending of Rs 1.11 lakh crore in 2022-23 compares with a revised estimate of Rs 1.04 lakh crore for the current fiscal year that ends in March, according to Union budget documents.

In the Union Budget for 2022-23, the government continued on its path of supply-side economics and plans to boost investments, thereby increasing jobs and consumption instead of directly announcing any monetary relief to the lower end of the population.

None of the oil PSUs gets any subsidy support from the government.

The government has provided a small Rs 4,000 crore subsidy on domestic cooking gas (LPG) in the next fiscal.

The subsidy outgo in the current fiscal has been put at Rs 3,400 crore, lower than Rs 12,480 crore budgeted at the beginning of the fiscal, the documents showed.

ONGC has planned a capital expenditure (capex) of Rs 29,950 crore in FY23, marginally lower than the revised estimated expenditure of Rs 30,500 crore in the current fiscal.

The current fiscal spending is higher than Rs 29,800 crore planned spending at the beginning of the year.

IOC, the nation’s largest oil refining and fuel marketing company, has an outlay of Rs 28,549 crore for the next year, almost the same as FY22.

Gas utility GAIL will invest Rs 7,500 crore in the expansion of pipeline grid and petrochemical plants, up from Rs 7,160 crore revised expenditure in the current fiscal (FY22).

Privatization-bound BPCL’s Rs 10,000 crore planned investment includes Rs 8,120 crore in refinery and fuel marketing and another Rs 500 crore in petrochemicals.

This compares with spending of Rs 10,500 crore in the current fiscal.

HPCL has a total outlay of Rs 14,500 crore for the next fiscal, 7 per cent more than the estimated spending in the current year.

OIL’s capex for FY23 is marginally higher at Rs 4,302 crore. ONGC’s overseas investment arm, ONGC Videsh has been a drag on achieving the spending targets for the current fiscal.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman left unchanged the cess on production from domestic oil blocks, despite industry’s long-standing demand to waive it.

The industry had been requesting for a cut, if not a complete waiver, from the cess. They had argued that this could encourage domestic producers to shore up production, step up exploration and protect margins.

Crude oil and natural gas produced from the field are subject to a 20 percent ad valorem oil industry development cess. Typically, the applicable cess rate differs depending on whether the contract is based on revenue sharing or production sharing.

The cess reduction or waiver would have boosted the revenue of crude oil exploration and production companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Oil India and Cairn Oil & Gas (Vedanta). The industry had sought it so that domestic producers become more price competitive compared with their global counterparts as there is no cess on imported crude oil.

In Budget 2016-17, the government had revised the way oil cess was charged by moving from a specific charge of Rs 4,500 per tonne of crude to an ad valorem rate of 20 per cent. The decision was meant to reduce the high cess burden at a time crude oil prices were falling.

Last year too, ahead of Budget 2021, the industry lobbied for the cess to be halved, saying that it put them at a disadvantage against imported oil. But the finance minister had left it unchanged.

The benchmark Brent crude futures have breached the levels of $90 a barrel, their highest levels since 2014, rising from lows of $68 in the beginning of December. Strong demand, coupled with geopolitical tension in West Asia and the threat of a Russian attack on neighbouring Ukraine has intensified concerns over supply disruptions.",306,0.3780471235513687

Bears ruled Dalal Street on Wednesday. The benchmark indices corrected 1 percent dragged by banking and financials, FMCG, and IT stocks. The BSE Sensex fell more than 650 points to close at 60,099, and the Nifty50 declined 175 points to 17,938, while the broader markets outperformed the equity benchmarks.

The Nifty Midcap 100 index was down 0.06 percent, and the Nifty Smallcap 100 index gained 0.01 percent.

Stocks that were in focus include ONGC, which was the biggest gainer in the Nifty50, rising 3.91 percent to Rs 170.25, while Biocon was the biggest gainer in the futures and options segment, rising 5.35 percent to Rs 367.35, and Bank of Baroda, which was the fifth biggest gainer in the futures and options segment, climbing 3.9 percent to Rs 95.85.

Among others, Precision Wires was locked in 20 percent upper circuit at Rs 122.75, and Tata Elxsi hit a record high of Rs 7,170, before closing 9.42 percent higher at Rs 6,977.25.

Here's what Mehul Kothari, of Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Bank of Baroda

During October 2021, Bank of Baroda confirmed a breakout from bullish pattern, which resembles Inverse Head and Shoulder. In addition, recently the stock has managed to close above its 200-week's SMA (simple moving average).

The theoretical target for this comes around Rs 140–150. Thus, we advise investors to hold the stock for few months. On the downside, support is at Rs 75.

Biocon

Biocon has been in a strong rising uptrend and the breakdown of the trend would happen only below Rs 300 mark. Thus, investors should continue to hold the stock with a stop-loss of Rs 300.

On the other hand, on daily chart the stock is still struggling below its 200-day moving average and that level is near to Rs 380 mark. Thus, traders can go long in the stock once a close above Rs 380 for fresh momentum on the upside.

ONGC

Since past few months, ONGC has done phenomenally well if we compare its price action of few years. The stock is in strong uptrend and currently on the verge of fresh breakout.

A monthly close above Rs 175 would open doors for Rs 200 and new life time high levels. Thus traders should adopt buy on dips strategy in the stock while investors should keep holding their positions. On the downside, support is placed at Rs 130 mark.

Precision Wires

The long-term chart of Precision Wires depicts that the stock is approaching a strong resistance of Rs 140 which if formed by the placement of upper end of the rising channel. Thus, at this point in time, traders should remain cautious and avoid aggressive bets in the stock since risk reward ratio is not favourable.

On the other hand, investors should think about booking some of their profits near Rs 140 level.

Tata Elxsi

Tata Elxsi has been one of the top outperformers from the IT space and it has given phenomenal returns to its investors. It has given a breakout on smaller time frame and there is no sign of profit-booking.

Thus, investors should continue to hold the stock and review only below Rs 5,500 mark. Traders can look for some dip to go long due to the recent fresh breakout.

India's production of crude oil, which is refined to produce petrol and diesel, continued to decline in December 2021, with lower output from state-owned ONGC leading to a near 2 per cent drop, official data showed on Wednesday. Oil production in December 2021 was 2.51 million tonnes, down from 2.55 million tonnes a year earlier and a target of 2.6 million tonnes. The output was, however, higher than 2.43 million tonnes production in November 2021.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) – India's biggest producer, produced 3 per cent less crude oil at 1.65 million tonnes in December due to delays in mobilising equipment at western offshore fields. Oil India Ltd (OIL) produced 5.4 per cent more crude oil at 2,54,360 tonnes. India is 85 per cent reliant on imports to meet its crude oil needs as domestic output is insufficient to meet the demand.

During April-December – the first nine months of the current fiscal year – crude oil production fell 2.63 per cent to 22.3 million tonnes. ONGC produced 4 per cent less oil at 14.6 million tonnes. Natural gas production, however, rose by almost a fifth to 2.89 billion cubic meters (bcm) in December, mainly due to output from newer fields in the KG-D6 block, operated by Reliance Industries Ltd and BP plc.

ONGC produced 5.42 per cent less gas at 1.75 bcm, while the output from eastern offshore – where KG-D6 is situated – jumped 515 per cent to 593.5 million cubic meters. The data did not give individual field output.

Reliance-BP in 2020 started gas production from newer fields in the KG-D6 block. During April-December, India's gas output rose 21.5 per cent to 25.6 bcm. While ONGC output was 6 per cent lower year-on-year, eastern fields production surged 1,049 per cent to 5.05 bcm. ONGC produced 12.5 per cent less than the target for the first nine months of the current fiscal.

With economic activity rebounding after a devastating second wave of COVID-19, refineries turned 2 per cent more crude oil into fuel in December and 10.5 per cent more during April-December. They processed 21.4 million tonnes of crude oil in December and 177.2 million tonnes in the first nine months of the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. Refineries operated at 101 per cent of their installed capacity in December. During April-December, the run-rate was 85.18 per cent, mostly because of lower capacity operations during the earlier part of the year when the COVID-19 second wave pummeled the economy, crushing fuel demand.

Refineries produced 6 per cent more petroleum products in December at 22.75 million tonnes when compared to the year-ago period. During April-December, the petroleum production output was 10 per cent more at 186 million tonnes.",469,-0.7929692924022674
2022-01-06 12:01:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/oil-and-gas-psus-regulator-face-uncertainty-over-top-appointments-7905871.html,"Leading public sector oil and gas companies and regulator Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) are running low on energy as appointments to many key positions in these organisations have been delayed.

ONGC, India’s largest oil exploration and production company, made history by appointing Alka Mittal as its first chairman and managing director. The government made the announcement on January 3, and said it was effective from January 1. In the absence of an official order, the PSU with the largest market cap was headless for almost three days. Moreover, this is an additional charge of six months for Mittal, who is Director of Human Resources at the company.

What’s worrying sector watchers is that ONGC has not had a full-time head for over nine months and has been managing with temporary appointments.

Regulator without a head

Regulator PNGRB itself has not had a chairman since December 2020, when incumbent Dinesh K Sarraf completed his tenure. Making things worse, the board of the regulator, which includes four members besides the chairman, was almost dysfunctional as three positions were vacant. Anjani Kumar Tiwari eventually joined as the second member on the board on December 1, 2021 but the other two positions are still vacant.

The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MOPNG) itself did not have a full-time secretary for a month last year after incumbent Tarun Kapoor superannuated in November 2021. Ministry of Mines Secretary Alok Tandon was given the additional responsibility of MOPNG secretary. Pankaj Jain, former additional secretary in the finance ministry, was appointed as the ministry secretary only at the end of December.

“Some companies and organisations are of strategic importance to the nation and stability is key for business operations. Investors, too, want stability. There could be, in rare instances, a genuine problem filling positions; but as a good practice, that is not preferable,” said Anil Razdan, former secretary to the power ministry and additional special secretary with the MOPNG.

Stop-gap arrangements

Privatisation bound-Bharat Petroleum Corporation of India (BPCL) also made interim arrangements after Chairman and Managing Director D Rajkumar retired on August 31, 2020, giving additional charge to K Padmakar, Director (HR). It was believed that the government may have been inclined to allow BPCL to announce the new management after privatisation is completed.

Arun Kumar Singh, who was earlier director of marketing, was appointed as the CMD only in May 2021; he is scheduled to retire in October. “After a delay of one year, they appointed a CMD for a year; it feels like a stop-gap arrangement. Three director positions are also vacant. What signal does it send to employees and investors,” a senior sector expert wondered.

BPCL currently does not have a director on the board for three functions: marketing, HR and refinery operations. Government headhunter Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) picked Sanjay Khanna, an executive director at the company’s Kochi refinery, for the post of director-refineries at BPCL, but his official appointment is still awaited.

In ONGC’s case, too, former CMD Shashi Shanker retired on March 31, 2021. While typically, the government selects a future CMD at least a few months before the retirement of the incumbent, in this case, the then senior-most director Subhash Kumar was given additional charge but he, too, retired at the end of December, leading to Mittal’s appointment.

PESB had received ten applications for the position but after interviews in May-June 2021, the headhunter announced that it was unable to find a suitable candidate and recommended a search committee.

“Why should the leadership of this organisation be restricted to PSU officials and bureaucrats? The government can bring in talent through international talent hunters and get a professional who can give the company stability and growth. Remuneration can be linked to performance targets. Perhaps issues like these are reflected in the inexpensive valuation of ONGC, which is India's premier exploration and production company,” said Harshvardhan Dole, Vice President, IIFL.

A detailed query sent to the Petroleum Ministry over the delays in appointments remains unanswered.

Speed bumps

Typically, each ministry informs the PESB much in advance about upcoming vacancies. The PESB then issues the vacancy, invites applications, shortlists candidates, interviews them and then announces the selection. Only when the Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC) approves the selected candidate is the appointment final.

There has been criticism that the long-winding process of top appointments causes delays, but vacancies piled up last year as PESB itself was headless from September 2020 to April 2021 as its Chairman Rajiv Kumar was transferred to the Election Commission of India (ECI) on September 1, 2020.

Interestingly, his replacement, Mallika Srinivasan, was previously the CMD of Tractors and Farm Equipment (TAFE) Limited, marking a rare appointment from the private sector for the government body, which traditionally has been headed by a former bureaucrat. Could this be a sign that the government won’t shy away from hiring top bosses from the private sector?

“It’s not easy to hire a top executive from the private sector; there still is a huge gap in remuneration. There is also the issue of cultural mismatch; the executive may not be able to adapt and the senior management may also have issues accepting an outsider,” Razdan said from his experience.

For the sake of comparison-- according to ONGC’s Annual Report, former chief Shashi Shanker drew a total compensation of Rs 1.39 crore in FY21. In the same year, PMS Prasad, Director of Reliance Industries, who heads the group’s energy business, received Rs 11.65 crore as salary and allowances.

There are also flip-flops in decision making.

In June 2021, former power Secretary Sanjeev Nandan Sahai was selected as the new chairman of oil regulator PNGRB but the government did not approve his appointment and the position was advertised again.

“The government should review why it is not able to get suitable candidates at once for organisations of ONGC’s or PNGRB’s calibre. If the same process is repeated, it will yield the same result. If, after interviewing nine senior people for ONGC they couldn’t find a CMD, they need to cast the net wider. But whatever they do, there is no justification for delays in appointments in companies we proudly call maharatnas,” a former top oil and executive from a PSU said.",1040,-0.6592103838920593

Industrialist Anand Mahindra on Wednesday congratulated Alka Mittal on becoming the first woman to head oil company ONGC.

Mittal, who is the second woman in the country to head an oil company after Hindustan Petroleum's Nishi Vasudeva, is currently the director (HR) of the oil giant. But, she will get to keep her position for only six months or until a regular chairperson is hired, whichever is earlier. Her ascent though signifies the diversity in the male-dominated sector -- a point which Mahindra mentioned in his tweet.



Smashing through glass barriers in the oil industry. The leadership ranks of global oil majors have traditionally been infused with machismo. This is no ordinary achievement. Bravo Alka! I hope you are the forerunner of many more women CEOs of oil companies worldwide. https://t.co/T02NLDa6sC

Several Twitter users joined Anand Mahindra in applauding Mittal's achievement. Monika Jagota, an English lecturer in Delhi, tweeted, ""She deserves a deafening applause. Women breaking through glass ceilings in all walks of life are super inspirational. Thank you Alka Mittal Ma’am for raising the bar.""

G Ramesh, a retired professor from IIM Bangalore, wrote, ""Excellent news. As big an achievement as becoming CEO of any MNC.""

In December, Mahindra had lauded Shar Dubey, the Indian-origin Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Match Group, who has spoken out against the abortion law in Texas.

Mahindra said in his tweet that he had never heard of Dubey before. “Is she not often cited in the lists of global Indian-origin CEOs because the companies she leads are matchmaking sites?” he asked. ""Tinder is the world’s most popular dating app. It’s a behemoth. She deserves to be in the spotlight.”

Subhash Kumar, former director (finance) was given the additional charge of the post from April 1, 2021. Kumar too retired end-December, leaving the top position vacant for a couple of days.

Given that Mittal is currently the senior most on the board of directors, it was speculated that she would be given the CMD’s position but the formal orders came late on January 3.

About Alka Mittal

A postgraduate in Economics, MBA (HRM) and Doctorate in Commerce and Business Studies, she joined ONGC as a graduate trainee in 1985.

Mittal went on to become the first woman to hold the charge of a full-time director in ONGC’s history.

Prior to joining as director (HR), Mittal held the charge of chief skill development (CSD) of the company. In her capacity as CSD in-charge, she streamlined the activities and brought in uniformity in the working of the skill development centres of ONGC, stated a note published on her on the company's official website.

During this period, she has also implemented the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) in ONGC engaging more than 5,000 apprentices across all work centres, it said.

Previously, she worked as Head CSR at the corporate office and took up major CSR projects across India.

Earlier, she led the HR-ER functions in various capacities across regions including Vadodara, Mumbai, Delhi and Jorhat, and was also the head of corporate communications of ONGC during 2009.",392,-0.9783703684806824

The Oil Ministry’s proposal to strip ONGC of its main oil and gas producing fields of Mumbai High and Bassein in the western offshore is a ""systematic weakening"" of the state-owned firm, well-regarded former bureaucrat E A S Sarma has written to the Prime Minister.

In the letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the former secretary to the government of India, said instead of ""weakening"" ONGC, the government should adopt a conscious strategy to strengthen its ability and should be given sufficient functional autonomy instead of forcing it to buy debt-laden firms or pay high dividends.

""The latest decision of the government to ask ONGC to hive off the majority stake in the Mumbai High/ Bassein/Satellite Fields seems to be a part of an ill-advised (well-orchestrated?) strategy to cripple ONGC as the mascot of India’s self-reliance in the field of hydrocarbons.

""Is it a part of a larger plan to divest public equity in ONGC, as has been the case with many strategic PSUs of late? The government’s real intentions, in this case, raise serious public concern,"" he wrote on November 23.

Amar Nath, additional secretary (exploration) in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, had on October 28, written a three-page letter to ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Subhash Kumar, saying productivity of the Mumbai High and Bassein & Satellite (B&S) offshore assets under the state-owned firm was low and international partners should be invited and given 60 per cent stake and operatorship in the fields.

Reached for comments, Sarma confirmed writing to the Prime Minister against the ""systematic weakening"" of ONGC and said he has sought reversal of the plan.

""The methodology of the disinvestment policy has been to first weaken a PSU and then offer it on a platter to private companies,"" he said. In the letter to the Prime Minister, Sarma said Mumbai High, Bassein & other western offshore satellite oil fields constitute a significant proportion of ONGC’s discovered hydrocarbons assets.

Hydrocarbon production from those fields constitutes around 63 per cent of ONGC’s total production and more than 40 per cent of India’s output.

""If the directive issued by the government were to be enforced, it would amount to stripping the Corporation of its most valuable assets and crippling its contribution to nation-building,"" he wrote.

""To strip ONGC of the bulk of its highly valuable hydrocarbon assets and give them away to foreign companies would amount to turning the clock back,"" he wrote.

The Petroleum Ministry on November 22, clarified on Nath’s letter saying production from existing fields has to be increased through all means including technology and involvement of private-sector companies in a transparent manner.

""The government is keen that the domestic production of oil and gas should increase exponentially. ONGC, being the leading organization, has to play an important role,"" the ministry had said in a statement.

It said, the area under exploration has to be increased which would subsequently lead to more new discoveries in the country. Also, ""production from existing fields has also to be optimised and increased wherever possible by employing advanced technology, drilling more production wells, wherever technically feasible, and better management,"" it said.

""For this, private sector companies can be involved as partners or through various business models so that new techniques and technology can be brought in through such companies which have experience in this,"" it said.

""However, all this has to be done by following systems and procedures in a transparent manner. ONGC has to prepare its plan and take the right decisions in order to increase domestic production,"" it had added.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) unions too have opposed the proposal saying it amounted to giving prime assets on a platter to the private sector. Sarma in the letter said, for the government to 'direct' ONGC to hive off the bulk of its hydrocarbon resources ""amounts to making a mockery of the premise that the government should function at an arm’s length distance from the PSUs. It has certainly set a bad precedent in so far as the concept of PSUs is concerned.""

Stating that the government has over the last few years repeatedly encroached on ONGC’s autonomy and interfered with its finances and operations, he said, in 2016, ONGC was forced to acquire an 80 per cent stake in the KG Block assets of Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation, a state PSU that had already entangled itself with a heavy debt burden.

""This amounted to crippling ONGC financially and forcing the Corporation to divert its scarce resources from priority investments in its own fields to areas where the returns may not prove to be productive enough,"" he said.

Also, ONGC has been forced to declare dividends beyond its means, thereby eroding its ability to invest its disposable income on the exploration and development of hydrocarbons.

Between 2014 and 2021, ONGC was forced to declare 27 per cent of its net profit accruals as dividends, which resulted in its capital investments during the same time frame plummeting to 24 per cent of its net profits.

Also, the government had unilaterally announced that 149 discovered oil fields of ONGC would be auctioned to private companies, a move that would hurt ONGC’s interests.

""If it is merely a question of securing access to a foreign technology for enhancing oil/gas production from these fields, there are more benign ways to do it. ONGC can always enter into technology collaboration arrangements with the necessary safeguards with the foreign companies, instead of parting with its highly valuable assets on which it has invested its sweat and toil,"" he wrote.",931,-0.22795063257217407

After a day of rebound, the market again slipped into the bear grip with the benchmark indices losing half a percent on November 24. Heavy selling by FIIs, and correction in FMCG, IT, auto and select pharma stocks dampened the sentiment.

The Nifty50 fell 88 points to 17,415 and now experts feel if the index breaks the crucial 20-week SMA - estimated at 17,200 - in the coming days, then there could be chances that it may fall up to 17,000 mark.

The BSE Sensex lost over 300 points to 58,341, while there was a mixed trend in the broader markets with the Nifty Midcap 100 index declining 0.4 percent and the Nifty Smallcap 100 index rising 0.63 percent.

Stocks that were in focus include Zee Entertainment Enterprises which rallied 7.04 percent to close at Rs 334.40, and Adani Ports which surged 4.63 percent to Rs 763.05. Both the stocks were top gainers in the futures and options segment.

ONGC was the third biggest gainer in the F&O space, rising 4.60 percent to Rs 153.45, while Laurus Labs closed with 2.93 percent gains at Rs 502.10.

Here's what Gaurav Sharma of Globe Capital Markets, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises

It is on the verge of a breakout from a congestion range of Rs 290-335 in which it was consolidating from over two months. After the breakout, the stock has the potential to scale up to Rs 370-380 in the weeks to come.

Considering this, the existing shareholders should hold on their positions and potential buyers must wait for the breakout to initiate fresh longs.

ONGC

It moved steeply higher on November 24 with volume support. This indicates carryover of long positions, which is a positive development. It is looking quite attractive on short as well as medium term charts.

Sustenance above Rs 156/158 levels will be the key for further up move that can take towards Rs 172 levels which is the next resistance level.

Laurus Labs

It has performed exceptionally well in the past one year, rallying from Rs 100 to Rs 700 levels during that period. Recently, some profit-taking was witnessed due to which the stock slipped till Rs 445.

Considering its over-performance, this decline seems a good buying opportunity for a medium-term perspective where one can expect the stock retesting its highest point at Rs 700-plus.

Adani Ports

It is trading in a broad range of Rs 650 to Rs 900 from the past six months. The zig-zag move is likely to continue till that range is crossed.

Recently, some buying interest was witnessed with an exceptional rise in volume. This is a very positive sign, indicating that the upward move will continue till Rs 800-820 levels.

Considering a rangebound chart structure, this is an opportunity for swing traders to buy at dips and sell near resistances.

A consortium of three state-owned Indian oil companies is seeking investment in Russia's Rosneft’s Vostok project in a bid to gain energy security, a report has said.

Technical evaluation of 30 of 52 licence areas for the Vostok project has been completed by the consortium of ONGC Videsh (OVL), Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) and Oil India (OIL), sources have told the Mint.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

Talks were in a preliminary stage and participatory interest would be based on the evaluation of technical data, the report cited a source as saying.

All will “depend on how much is recoverable. Once the reserves match with the operator’s numbers, then the commercial evaluation will happen”, the source said.

Besides Vostok, the consortium expressed interest in buying a stake in Novatek, which owns 60 percent in Russia’s liquefied natural gas project Arctic LNG-2, the source said, adding the two projects being looked at “are high priority”.

A spokesperson for Rosneft said the company was “negotiating entry with a number of potential partners”, including “a consortium of Indian companies”, which he did not name.

He, however, said Rosneft “could be” among the interest projects and that results would be out “in a timely manner”.

Vostok is part of a multi-pronged India-Russia energy partnership–energy sourcing and supplies, upstream investments and collaboration in petrochemicals. The two countries are also discussing long-term crude oil deals.

State oil companies have invested $16 billion in Russia, including O&G assets Sakhalin-1, Vankor and Taas-Yuryakh and East and East Siberia.

OVL said it would not comment on specific opportunities but the company “continues to consider, evaluate and process several global business opportunities”.

At a time when crude oil and natural gas prices are sky-high, public sector behemoth ONGC's haphazard planning and mismanagement in developing showpiece deep-sea KG-D5 block is costing the nation over Rs 18,000 crores due to the delayed output of oil and gas, government officials said.

ONGC was originally to start gas production from the Cluster-II fields in block KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) in June 2019 and the first oil was to flow in March 2020.

But these targets were quietly shifted to end-2021 because of deferments in awarding the fragmented work packages of the project, two officials with direct knowledge of the matter said on condition of anonymity.

The project now is further pushed back because of differences in interface issues -- simply put compatibility --between major work packages related to pipelines, process platforms and storage and offloading vessels.

Crude oil is now expected to reach Indian shores in the third quarter of 2022 -- against the revised target of November 2021 - and natural gas in May 2023 -- against the revised target of May 2021, they said.

With oil flow from Cluster II alone estimated at 47,000 barrels per day or 2 million tonnes per annum and gas at 6 million cubic meters per day or 2.2 billion cubic meters per annum, the output delay would collectively cost the nation Rs 18,000 crore in foreign exchange.

""This is a conservative figure considering crude price remains at USD 82 a barrel, gas at USD 6.13 per million British thermal units and the US dollar at Rs 75,"" an official said.

While ONGC did not offer any immediate comments on the story, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Subhash Kumar at an earnings call with investors on Saturday said the project continues to be impacted by ""disruption in supply chains"".

Stating that he can't give a timeline for the start of the production, he said pandemic-related restrictions continue in Malaysia and Singapore, impacting the supply of equipment needed for the project.

On November 11, Petroleum Secretary Tarun Kapoor had stated that the government wants ONGC to involve private sector firms and domain knowledge experts wherever possible to help raise oil and gas production and help cut import bills.

Before that, the second-highest-ranked official in the petroleum ministry on October 28 wrote formally to Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), asking it to give away a 60 per cent stake plus operating control in some of the firm's prime fields to foreign companies.

Officials said the KG-D5 project has faced problems in execution right from the beginning.

""We have been seeking reports and reviewing the project with ONGC, and it is clear that the execution could have been better,"" an official said, adding the two consultants hired by the company haven't worked in sync.

Project management consultant Nauvata Engineering and its partner Consub Ltd, which looked after detailed engineering, design and project management, is not taking ownership of the conceptual design by first consultant Intecsea, which did the pre-FEED, bid packages preparation and award of work.

Besides divergence between the first and the second consultant, the latter has refused to take any responsibility for work done in the earlier phases of the project by the first consultant.

Cost overruns are also being reported.

For example, $100 million is estimated in cost overrun in connectivity issues between subsea umbilical, risers and flowline (SURF) -- subsea production system (SPS); central process platform (CPP) living quarter and utility platform (LQUP) and floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO).

""Despite the huge financial strain on the nation, ONGC is in no hurry to resolve the issues as it couches the delays on COVID pandemic instead of accepting that the delay was on account of mismatches arising because of hiring two separate consultants for different works and fragmenting the project into multiple packages in awarding contracts,"" the official said.

The two inherent faults continue to riddle the project, he added.

To develop complex deepwater fields, inputs from one sub-project are crucial for the implementation of subsequent work packages.

Awarding Cluster II as separate packages resulted in non-synchronisation of their inter-dependency in terms of inputs on technical specifications as well as work schedules.

Since it was broken into multiple packages and the awards of work to multiple vendors were delayed, the Cluster II development project is battling with numerous interface issues.

Sources said that there have been delays in deploying the drilling rig resource for oil well completion due to a mismatch in the supplies of Xmas trees by SURF-SPS contractor and mobilization of rigs by ONGC.

They said that as against the revised plan of deploying the third rig by June 2021 for oil processing completion, the rig is now being mobilised from January 2022, a delay of six months. That could mean an additional Rs 5,500 crore payout by the nation.

""Much damage has been done by hiring separate consultants that bicker among themselves over technical aspects and by awarding the project in bits and pieces to different contractors who are working at their own pace without any accountability on the overall progress or compatibility,"" the official said.

Amar Nath, Additional Secretary (Exploration) in the Petroleum Ministry, wrote to ONGC chairman Subhash Kumar last month that ""ONGC's contribution in crude oil consumption of India has declined drastically to a paltry 9 per cent in 2020-21"" and should consider divesting majority share in its prolific producing assets Mumbai High and Bassein in the Western Offshore.",909,-0.7412793984015783

The government is pushing the public sector behemoth ONGC to involve private sector companies and service providers wherever possible to help raise oil and gas production, Petroleum Secretary Tarun Kapoor said Thursday.

Kapoor’s comments came days after the second-highest ranked official in his ministry asked Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to give away a 60 per cent stake plus operating control in India’s largest oil and gas producing fields of Mumbai High and Bassein to foreign companies.

""ONGC has to explore more so that it can discover more oil and gas reserves and bring them quickly to production to raise domestic output. The government is very clear that ONGC has to do more,” he told reporters.

India is 85 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs, and a way to cut the high import bill is to increase domestic production.

""Naturally, when they do more work, there are areas where they can get experts in the fields… such as in deepsea,” Kapoor said.

Discoveries that the company hasn’t been able to develop or areas that it hasn’t been able to explore are some of the examples where the ONGC can involve the private sector and foreign companies.

ONGC, he said, should identify areas where it can get private sector expertise and efficiencies.

These could range from technical collaboration to giving partially explored and undeveloped discoveries to private firms.

The private sector can also be involved in enhancing production from existing fields.

""We have only made suggestions to ONGC… the government cannot give directive to a Maharatna company. The ultimate decision has to be taken by the company board,” he said.

Amar Nath, additional secretary (exploration) in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, on October 28 wrote a 3-page letter to ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Subhash Kumar, saying productivity of the Mumbai High and Bassein & Satellite (B&S) offshore assets under state-owned firm was low, and international partners should be invited and given 60 per cent participating interest (PI) and operatorship.

This is the second time since April that Nath, who is part of the ONGC management as the longest-serving government nominee director on its board and often considered a potential candidate to replace Kumar next year, has written an official letter, painting a poor picture of the company’s performance.

According to the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by PTI, he said the redevelopment projects will raise recovery of the mature and continuously declining Mumbai High field from 28 per cent to 32 per cent, ""which is quite low"".

Mumbai High, which was discovered in 1974, and B&S that was put into production in 1988 are Oil and Natural Gas Corporation’s (ONGC) mainstay assets, contributing two-thirds of its current oil and gas production.

Without these assets, the company will be left with only smaller fields. Mumbai High, which was discovered in 1974, and B&S that was put into production in 1988 are Oil and Natural Gas Corporation’s (ONGC) mainstay assets, contributing two-thirds of its current oil and gas production.

The two letters by Nath are the third attempt by the oil ministry to get ONGC to privatise its oil and gas fields under the Modi government.

In October 2017, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, the ministry’s technical arm, had identified 15 producing fields with a collective reserve of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic meters of gas, for handing over to private firms in the hope that they would improve upon the baseline estimate and its extraction.

A year later, as many as 149 small and marginal fields of ONGC were identified for private and foreign companies on the grounds that the state-owned firm should focus only on big ones.

The first plan couldn’t go through because of strong opposition from ONGC, sources aware of the matter said.

The second plan went to the Cabinet, which on February 19, 2019, decided to bid out 64 marginal fields of ONGC.

But, that tender got a tepid response, they said, adding that ONGC was allowed to retain 49 fields on the condition that their performance will be strictly monitored for three years.

Nath in both April 1 and October 28 letters stated that two years have elapsed since the Cabinet decision but ONGC is yet to initiate the process for partnerships.

ONGC produced 20.2 million tonnes of crude oil in the fiscal year ending March 31 (2020-21), down from 20.6 million tonnes in the previous year and 21.1 million tonnes in 2018-19.

It produced 21.87 bcm of gas in 2020-21, down from 23.74 bcm in the previous year and 24.67 bcm in 2018-19.",774,0.3249314171927316

According to news agency PTI, which has seen a letter sent on October 28 by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to ONGC, the latter has been asked to offer operating control to international partners in addition to the majority stake in the two oil and gas producing fields.

The three-page letter was reportedly sent by Amar Nath, additional secretary (exploration) in the the oil ministry, to ONGC chairman and managing director Subhash Kumar.

In the letter, Nath reportedly cited the low productivity of the Mumbai High and Bassein & Satellite (B&S) offshore assets while asking the company to call international partners with the offer of 60 percent participating interest (PI) and operatorship, PTI said in an exclusive report.

Nath further stated, as per the report, that the redevelopment projects will increase recovery of Mumbai High field from 28 percent to 32 percent, ""which is quite low"".

""The field has substantial potential to contribute to domestic production,"" PTI quoted him as saying, adding that the infrastructure such as pipelines and platforms on the fields are ""ageing and leaking and need replacement/revamping"".

""The ONGC will, however, find this challenging as its improvement/development projects have lagged behind schedule. Procedural aspects and other constraints will not encourage ONGC to take quick decisions,"" he reportedly added.

The company ""should bring a joint venture partner of international experience and farm out 60% PI and operatorship of the field,"" Nath reportedly wrote.

While projects on B&S Assets, which encompasses Bassin field - the largest gas producing field in India, envisage raising recovery factor to 70% from the current low of 45%, ""ONGC can plan for a substantial increase from this field"" and ""can provide an entry point to international players to India to invest in gas and energy infrastructure,"" he added.

Mumbai High, found in 1974, and B&S which was put into production in 1988, are two of the mainstay assets of ONGC. They reportedly contribute around two-third of the company's current production.

The letter by Nath, reportedly asking ONGC to offset the majority stake in the two major fields, comes months after the then oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the government will auction un-monetised large oil and gas fields of ONGC and Oil India Ltd. (OIL) to increase the country’s hydrocarbon production.

“Resources don’t belong to a company. They belong to the nation and the government. They cannot lie with a company indefinitely. If someone does not monetise these resources, new enterprises will have to be brought in (to do so),” Pradhan said in June, during the launch of the third round of auctions for discovered small fields.

According to data from the petroleum ministry, domestic crude oil production dipped 20 percent to 30.5 million tonnes (MT) in 2020-21 from 38.1 MT in 2011-12. Even in 1998-99, the earliest year for which data is available, output was 32.8 MT, 7 percent higher than in 2020-21.

Gross production of natural gas slipped 40 percent to 28,670 million metric standard cubic meters (MMSCM) in 2020-21 from 47,555 MMSCM in 2011-12.

While the dismal show in 2020-21 may have been due to the pandemic, crude production was down at 32.2 MT and natural gas at 31,184 MMSCM in 2019-20.

The momentum remained in control of bulls for the second consecutive session of the week as the market started off the day on a volatile note but gained strength in the afternoon and closed seven-tenth of a percent higher on October 5. IT stocks remained strong along with buying in select banking and financials, and auto stocks.

The BSE Sensex added more than 400 points to close above 59,700 levels, while the Nifty50 closed decisively above the 17,800 mark with 130 points gains. The broader markets also maintained its northward journey as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 0.4 percent each.

Stocks that were in focus include PSU oil and gas major ONGC, which was the biggest gainer in the Nifty50 with a 10.87 percent rally to close at Rs 163.65 after hitting a fresh 52-week high of Rs 164.60, and private sector lender IndusInd Bank which was the second biggest gainer in the benchmark index, rising 4.36 percent to close at Rs 1,168.60.

Chemical manufacturing company IG Petrochemicals saw strong demand, hitting a record high of Rs 928.10, before closing with 19.61 percent gains at Rs 925.10.

Here's what Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation

In the current month, this counter seems to have registered a fresh breakout from the seven-year-old down sloping trendline on monthly charts. Hence, as long as this counter sustains above Rs 149 levels, which is the breakout point on the monthly charts, one shall retain the bullish bias on this counter and look to buy on dips.

Moreover, as this counter registered a breakout on long-term charts after a prolonged down trend from the highs of Rs 314 registered in the year 2014, a bigger upsides towards Rs 200 can't be ruled out going forward.

However, for the time being, positional traders are advised to hold for a target of Rs 179 levels. Fresh buying should be considered on a dip into the zone of Rs 156–152 with a stop loss below Rs 148.

IndusInd Bank

Last three weeks of price behaviour hints that this counter is moving in a narrow range of Rs 1,189–1,084 levels. Hence, initially to display signs of strength, it needs to sustain above Rs 1,190 going forward.

However, on weekly charts, a long-term trend line which is in progress from the highs of Rs 2,038 registered in the year 2018 is likely to offer resistance around Rs 1,211. Therefore, for a fresh breakout and sustainable upswing, it needs to clear the hurdle in the Rs 1,190–1,211 levels.

On such a close, a higher target of Rs 1,297 can be expected. But for the time being, traders who hold this counter are advised to exit if it fails to close above Rs 1,190 by the end of this week and better buying opportunity shall arise only on a close above Rs 1,211.

IG Petrochemicals

This counter registered a fresh breakout, in style, on relatively higher volumes to enter into uncharted territories. Interestingly, for last 31 weeks, this counter is moving in an ascending channel and in last session with a strong price appreciation it closed way above the upper boundary of the said channel by opening up much higher targets towards Rs 1,045 levels.

Hence, traders are advised to adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and adding further on dips into the zone of Rs 879–850 and look for a higher target of Rs 1,047.

But stop loss will remain at Rs 770, which looks wider and hence corrections towards the stop loss levels should also be used to accumulate further to make the risk reward ratios attractive.

The 62 percent increase in natural gas prices by the Indian government will boost the profitability of upstream companies in the country and support their investment spending, Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday.

The price for gas from fields that were assigned by the state to oil companies, mainly Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), increased to USD 2.90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) for October 2021-March 2022, from USD 1.79 per mmBtu in the previous six months.

""Higher gas prices will increase the input cost for key end-consumer sectors, to the extent the price hike is passed on,"" Fitch said.

Domestically produced gas is supplied on a priority basis to certain sectors, with 30 percent of it being consumed by power producers, around 27 percent by the fertiliser sector and 19 percent by city gas distributors in FY21.

The gas price increase will hit the fertiliser sector's profitability by increasing working-capital requirements, Fitch said.

Auto gas fuel's price will remain competitive against liquid fuels, albeit with a reduced differential, notwithstanding the gas price increase. This is because liquid auto fuel prices have also been climbing in recent months, given the rise in crude oil prices.

The cost of power generated by gas-based power plants will increase, which will further decrease their utilisation.

""ONGC's and OIL's ratings and standalone credit profiles (SCP) remain unchanged as the price increase was largely in line with Fitch's expectations, driven by the rise in global prices over July 2020-June 2021,"" the rating agency said in a statement.

However, sustained high gas prices will strengthen ONGC's ""bbb+"" SCP and will add buffer to OIL's credit metrics, which will support its capex to expand capacity at subsidiary Numaligarh Refinery Ltd.

The government also increased the price ceiling for gas produced from deepwater and other difficult fields to USD 6.13 per mmBtu from USD 3.62 per mmBtu.

""Reliance Industries Ltd's gas production from KG basin will benefit from the higher price ceiling, but the impact on RIL's financial profile is minimal as gas makes a limited contribution to its revenue,"" Fitch said.

The rating agency estimated ONGC's net leverage, measured by net debt/EBITDA, to improve to around 2.1x in the financial year ending March 2022 (FY22) from 2.7x in FY21 as upstream earnings recover and downstream earnings stay resilient.

Natural gas' share of consolidated revenues is in the mid-single digits for ONGC, given its integrated business model.

It expects OIL's FY22 leverage to be 1.9x. Natural gas accounted for about 13 percent of OIL's upstream revenue in FY21, Fitch said.

The bulls are roaring, helping the benchmark indices to hit historic highs and maintain the uptrend for the fifth consecutive week as of September 24.

The BSE Sensex decisively surpassed the 60,000 mark and the Nifty 50 drew closer to 18,000. However, a similar momentum was absent in the broader markets, as the BSE MidCap Index gained 0.59 percent and the SmallCap Index rose 0.06 percent.

Both the benchmark indices closed at a record. The BSE Sensex jumped 1,032.58 points, or 1.75 percent, to 60,048.47 during the week and the Nifty 50 climbed 268.05 points, or 1.52 percent, to 17,853.20.

Given the significant rally over the past one month, experts suggest that investors book timely profits and avoid aggressive buying. According to them, the next resistance on the Nifty 50 is expected at 18,000, with support at 17,600.

“Our markets had a remarkable comeback in the last four sessions as we not only managed to recover from lows but also went on to clock fresh highs,” said Sameet Chavan, chief analyst – technical and derivatives, at Angel Broking. “We have clearly outperformed global peers because despite a relief move in last two days, they are still trading well below their highs.”

He said the recovery beyond 17,600 was certainly surprising but the market was superior.

“Ideally, after the market surpassed previous highs, our cautious stance should have been negated, but there are a few time-wise projections as well as negative divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI)-smoothened oscillator, clearly holding us back,” he said.

As far as levels are concerned, every 100 points from here can be seen as an immediate resistance, i.e., 17,900-18,000. On the flipside, 17,700-17,650 are to be seen as key supports, Chavan said.

He advised traders to continue with a stock-specific approach but keep booking timely profits and avoid carrying aggressive overnight bets. Meanwhile, all eyes are on the global markets and on how the banking index, which could probably decide the next path of action for the markets, he said.

Here are 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on September 24 closing prices:



Sameet Chavan, chief analyst - technical and derivatives at Angel Broking



TThis stock had been consolidating for five to six months without any real momentum. However, the price suddenly took off after surpassing its sturdy wall of Rs 890. This move was accompanied with sizable volumes, providing credence to the move.

Pricewise, the daily chart now exhibits a bullish cup and handle pattern and we expect a decent move in this stock in the forthcoming week.

We recommend buying on a decline towards Rs 890-880 for a short-term target of Rs 960. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 853.

ONGC: Buy | CMP: Rs 136.10 | Stop Loss: Rs 129.80 | Target: Rs 149 | Return: 9.5 percent

This Maharatna company failed to live up to expectations for the past seven years. Even in the ongoing bull run, it did not participate much. But now, with crude oil prices trading at a three-year high, ONGC is showing some strength.

Last week, ONGC shares surpassed the key 200-day simple moving average on the weekly timeframe chart for the first time since May 2019. In addition, the average directional index (14) indicator has started displaying an upward trajectory. One can look to buy this stock for a near-term target of Rs 149. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 129.80.



Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst at HDFC Securities



After moving in a narrow high-low range for the past few weeks as per the weekly timeframe chart, the fertilizer stock showed an upside breakout at Rs 58.50 on September 24. The larger degree higher tops and bottoms are intact and the present upward move could be in line with the expected new higher top formation.

The stock price is currently placed above the hurdle of the 10- and 20-week exponential moving average at about Rs 59. Hence, a sustainable move above this area could open a sharp upside momentum in the stock price. Buying can be initiated in NFL at Rs 60, add more on dips to Rs 57, wait for the upside target of Rs 67 in the next three to four weeks, and place a stop-loss of Rs 55.

The Phoenix Mills: Buy | CMP: Rs 945.50 | Stop Loss: Rs 880 | Target: Rs 1,060 | Return: 12.1 percent

This realty stock witnessed a sharp upside breakout of the larger consolidation pattern on the weekly timeframe chart at Rs 900 and closed higher. The formation of consistent higher bottoms, as per the weekly timeframe chart, signals the intact medium-term uptrend in the price. Volumes expanded during the upside breakout and the weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication.

One may look to buy The Phoenix Mills at the current market price, add more on dips to Rs 910 and wait for the target of Rs 1,060 in the next three to four weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 880.

Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research (retail) at Kotak Securities

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | CMP: 779.45 | Stop Loss: Rs 750 | Target: Rs 850 | Return: 9.1 percent

The auto index made a strong comeback in the previous week after hitting the 200-day SMA support level. M&M made an exceptional recovery after hitting the lower boundary of the current trading range of Rs 740-Rs 850.

Technically, it seems the stock has formed a higher bottom at Rs 740 and is heading for the upward boundary, which is at Rs 850, with major resistance at Rs 790, where it has the hurdle of the 200-day SMA. Buy at current levels and add more on dips with a final stop-loss at Rs 750.

LIC Housing Finance: Buy | CMP: Rs 429.25 | Stop Loss: Rs 420 | Target: Rs 470 | Return: 9.5 percent

LIC Housing has decisively crossed the swing high at Rs 429 with a rise in volumes. After two months, the stock closed above the 200-day SMA, which is positive for the medium term. Reality stocks are rallying and that would help housing finance companies in the near term.

Sun Pharma: Buy | CMP: Rs 770.45 | Stop Loss: Rs 730 | Target: Rs 870 | Return: 12.9 percent

Technically, the stock is forming a symmetrical triangle. It has a bullish consolidation after rallying to Rs 804 from Rs 650. It is the biggest outperforming stock in the pharma basket and should be bought at current levels and more on dips to about Rs 750.

Protect long positions with a final stop loss at Rs 730. On the higher side, Rs 800 and Rs 830 would be major hurdles.

Ashis Biswas, head of technical research at CapitalVia Global Research

HDFC Bank: Buy | CMP: Rs 1,601.55 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,520 | Target: Rs 1,720 | Return: 7.4 percent

The stock has been following an uptrend. We have observed a major breakout above Rs 1,600. Indicators like the MACD (moving average convergence/divergence) and RSI suggest the momentum in the stock is likely to continue. We recommend a buy in HDFC Bank above Rs 1,605 with a target of Rs 1,720. Investors are advised to maintain a stop-loss of Rs 1,520.

HPCL: Buy | CMP: Rs 274.80 | Stop Loss: Rs 244 | Target: Rs 300 | Return: 9.2 percent

HPCL has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern. We expect a bullish movement in the stock from the support and the momentum to continue. It has taken support at the 200 DMA line. We recommend a buy above Rs 276 with a target of Rs 300 and a stop-loss of Rs 244 for a medium-term perspective.

JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals: Buy | CMP: Rs 1,835.80 | Target: Rs 2,050 | Return: 11.7 percent

The stock has reversed from near the support of the 100 DMA. We have observed a breakout from the cup and handle formation above Rs 1,800. We recommend a buy above Rs 1,840 with a target of Rs 2,050 and a stop-loss of Rs 1,695 for a medium-term perspective.

After a day of steep fall, the market recovered smartly, with the BSE Sensex climbing more than 500 points to reclaim the 59,000-mark on September 21. The recovery in most beaten-down sectors and the rally in global peers ahead of FOMC meeting lifted sentiment.

The Nifty also closed above 17,550, gaining 165.10 points driven by FMCG, IT, metals, pharma and select banking & financials stocks. The volatility also cooled down as the India VIX, which measures the expected volatility in the market, declined 5.55 percent.

Stocks that were in focus included state-owned oil & gas exploration company ONGC, which was the second-biggest gainer among Nifty50, rising 5.21 percent to close at Rs 135.20 after hitting an intraday high of Rs 136, the highest levels seen since November 2019. It has rallied 23 percent in the last month.

Mumbai-based real estate developer Godrej Properties hit a record high of Rs 1,758.60 before closing with gains of 4.78 percent at Rs 1,723.65, while multiplex chain operator PVR was also in action, rising 5.95 percent to Rs 1,508.50 and was the top gainer in the F&O segment.

Here's what Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist–Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Godrej Properties

This counter appears to have resumed its uptrend after a brief struggle for a couple of sessions, from the lows of Rs 1,602 hit on last Monday. As it is trading in uncharted territory, any mild weakness in the next session can be an opportunity to create fresh long positions.

A close look at the last 20 weeks of price action reveals that it is moving in some kind of ascending channel. Hence, a breakout above the said channel can open up bigger targets towards Rs 1,900.

Therefore, existing investors are advised to hold whereas fresh buying should be considered on dips but with a stop below Rs 1,650.

ONGC

Despite the current breakout on short-term charts, long- term trend remains down in this counter, as it topped out in 2014 with a high of Rs 314 and also remained an underperformer in the current 18-month bull market.

However, in the near term, as long as it sustains above Rs 125 a higher target of Rs 147 can be expected. In between, around Rs 145 levels, it may face stiff resistance from the down-sloping trendline on monthly charts, which is in progress from the highs of the year 2014.

Therefore, it looks prudent for traders to consider booking profits around Rs 140.

PVR

This counter appears to have registered a fresh breakout, from a downward tilting channel after remaining in a corrective and consolidation phase of 65 days. Hence, if it sustains above Rs 1,405, its initial target can be close to Rs 1,590.

But a bigger breakout with a brisk upmove for higher targets is possible on a close above Rs 1,592. In that scenario, a higher target of Rs 1,800 should be expected.

Traders are advised to hold for an initial target of Rs 1,590 by placing a stop below Rs 1,400. In between, any dip towards Rs 1,450 can also be an opportunity to create fresh longs.

ICICI Direct's research report on ONGC

Recommendation

Buy ONGC in range of Rs 123-125; Target: Rs 145; Stop Loss: Rs 112; Time frame: Three months.

Derivatives & Quantitative Outlook

Since the August series, the Nifty Energy index has gained over 11% against a 10% increase in the Nifty. Both midcap and large cap stocks witnessed buying support at every decline. The recent outperformance of oil & gas stocks brings the focus to ONGC, which has so far been unable to replicate the gains seen by the rest of its peers. We expect a catch up exercise to be seen in ONGC. The stock can move towards Rs 145 levels.

The open interest in the stock has increased gradually in the last two weeks along with a price recovery. This month we saw additions of 20% in open interest. Considering continuous additions and recovery of the stock, we expect further fresh accumulation to be seen, which should take the stock higher in the coming sessions.

ONGC Videsh (OVL) is planning to raise $700 million from overseas investors as syndicated loans in its efforts to take advantage of the falling interest rates in the international markets and retire its old loans, according to media reports.

The company has requested banks to send in their proposals for participating in the offer, which includes a $200-million greenshoe option. OVL expects several banks to join the offering — considering the investor demand for its previous offers. The syndicated loan is expected to be priced at around 100 basis points over the Libor rate, said a banker close to the transaction.

Infrastructure company MEIL said it has delivered the second oil rig to ONGC, and another 21 rigs will be supplied to the state-owned firm by 2022.

The delivery is a part of the Rs 6,000 crore order Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Ltd (MEIL) had won from ONGC for the supply of 47 rigs. MIEL is the first private company in India to manufacture oil and gas extraction rigs with indigenous technology, a company statement said.

An oil rig is a structure with equipment for drilling an oil well.

Outfitted with advanced hydraulic technology, the second rig is set to begin operations at an oil well near GGS-IV oil field near Kalol in Gujarat, under ONGC Ahmedabad Asset. By March 2022, 23 rigs will be delivered to ONGC. The aim is to hand over all the 47 rigs at the earliest, the company said.

""MEIL is also planning to expand its overall business to up to USD 2 billion in coming days by manufacturing indigenous rigs. MEIL will manufacture and supply it in India and globally,"" it said without divulging any further information.

The oil rigs manufactured by MEIL with advanced hydraulic technology dig oil wells faster and operates with minimal power. With a capacity of 1,500 HP, the rig can easily drill up to 4,000 metres. The rig is expected to be operational for 40 years and comes with the most modern technology, even in terms of security standards.

P Rajesh Reddy, Vice-President, MEIL, said India is importing 80 per cent oil products. Reducing dependence on energy imports is a must for the success of Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat. MEIL is proud to be contributing to both the initiatives and playing its part in boosting domestic oil production and securing the country’s energy future.

The indigenous component level in the advanced rigs is 50 per cent at present, and will be increased to 90 per cent over time, he added.

""Until recently, India was mostly dependent on oil and fuel extraction rig imports, but MEIL has significantly boosted domestic rig manufacturing capacity. The second rig handed over to ONGC is manufactured with state-of-the-art hydraulic and automated technology. ONGC will benefit from these advanced rigs built with cutting-edge technology,"" N Krishna Kumar, Head-Oil Rigs Division, MEIL said.

MEIL will manufacture and deliver the rigs to ONGC Assets in Assam (Shib Sagar, Jorhat), Andhra Pradesh (Rajahmundry), Gujarat (Ahmedabad, Ankleshwar, Mehsana and Cambay), Tripura (Agartala) and Tamil Nadu (Karaikal).

ONGC's order of 47 rigs comprises 20 workover rigs and 27 land drilling rigs. The 20 workover rigs include 12 with a capacity of 50 MT, four of 100 MT capacity, and another four with 150 MT capacity.

MEIL further said the rigs can operate at -65 degrees also. These rigs are completely automated and have high efficiency and performance. These rigs are very flexible in transportation and can be moved to any location easily.",495,0.993305116891861

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) on Thursday invited bids from private companies for handing over operations of 43 small and marginal oil and gas fields with a view to raising production.

The 43 onland fields have been clustered into 11 contract areas that will be bid out to companies offering the highest oil and gas output on top of a pre-decided baseline, the company said in a statement.

ONGC had in June 2019 invited similar bids for 64 fields that were clustered into 17 contract areas. The bid round did not evoke much interest and failed.

""ONGC announces Notice Inviting Offer (NIO) seeking partners for enhancement of production from its marginal nomination fields in line with its goal of maximizing recovery from its producing fields,"" the statement said.

The fields on offer have a total in-place oil and oil equivalent gas volume of about 160 million tonne.

""These contract areas are spread across the states of Gujarat, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh,"" it said.

The 64 fields offered in 2019 held a cumulative 300 million tonne of oil and oil equivalent natural gas reserves.

The oil ministry has been unhappy with the near stagnant oil and gas production and believes giving out the discovered fields to private firms would help raise output as they can bring in technology and capital.

It has been tasked by the Prime Minister to cut dependence on oil imports by 10 per cent by 2022 from the over 77 per cent dependence in 2014-15. But the dependence has only increased and is now over 83 per cent.

""Eligible companies (Indian or foreign), either alone or in consortium with other companies, may bid for one or more contract areas,"" the statement said adding the bidders are required to fulfill the requisite technical and financial criteria.

The last date for bidding is December 3.

A pre-bid conference will be held on October 20, 2021.

""Bidders interested in studying the data can purchase field information docket and data packages. Upon request, the interested companies shall be able to access the data viewing facility at IRS, Ahmedabad and visit the fields, if required,"" it said.

ONGC said operators will have complete marketing and pricing freedom to sell hydrocarbons on an arm's length basis through competitive bidding.

""Partner will be selected on a revenue-sharing basis. The revenue will be shared on incremental production over and above the baseline production under business-as-usual (BAU) scenario,"" it said.

The contract period will be for 15 years with an option to extend by 5 years.

""A reduction of 10 per cent in the royalty rate for incremental production of natural gas over and above BAU scenario"" will be offered, it said.

Continuous exploration is permitted during the contract period including the right to explore all kinds of hydrocarbon.

Also, no past investment/ expenditure incurred by ONGC is to be shared or paid by the contractor.

While ease of entry/ exit will be provided, an incentive will also be given to enhance production beyond committed incremental production, ONGC added.",519,0.8987570255994797

Energy companies Chevron and Total are separately in talks with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to engage in upstream projects in India, The Economic Times has reported.

While foreign energy companies have not shown much interest in India's energy exploration sector, American company Chevron's senior executives had discussed such opportunities with ONGC last month, the newspapers cited sources as saying. French company Total has formed a technical committee of key executives to explore such opportunities, the report added.

Moneycontrol couldn't independly verfy the story.

ONGC signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in 2019 with Exxon Mobil to receive its expertise and technology for developing resources in offshore blocks. It provided for ONGC and ExxonMobil jointly bidding for exploration assets in India.

Chevron had reported its highest profit in six quarters and joined an oil industry stampede to reward investors with share buybacks, as rebounding crude oil prices carried earnings and cash flow to pre-pandemic levels. The company last year slashed spending to allow profits to flow at above $50 a barrel. Lower costs and higher prices generated the highest cash flow in two years, enabling the company to pare debt and resume share repurchases.

The company had also outlined a plan, in March, to expand oil and gas production through 2025 without spending significantly more and to limit the pace of growth of its carbon emissions.

Oil and gas are trading near multi-year highs as fuel consumption has thrown off pandemic losses and natural gas has soared on weather demand. OPEC's decision to carry production curbs into next year has kept oil trading above $70 per barrel.

A two-decade-old LPG supply order restricting supply of domestically produced LPG to only state-owned oil companies has stymied plans to allow Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) to continue selling subsidised cooking gas (LPG) after its privatisation.

A legal opinion has now been sought to ascertain if privatised BPCL will be eligible to receive liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) produced by companies such as ONGC and GAIL, two government officials with knowledge of the development said. Currently, BPCL has more than 8.4 crore domestic LPG customers, including 2.1 crore Ujjwala customers. The company does not produce enough LPG at its refineries to be able to cater to the requirement of all these.

It, like other oil marketing companies, buys LPG from state-owned firms like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and GAIL (India) Ltd as well as private companies such as Reliance Industries Ltd. The Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Regulation of Supply and Distribution) Order, 2020, known as LPG Control Order of 2000, restricts sale of indigenously produced cooking gas only to state-owned oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and BPCL.

It restricts supply of LPG produced by firms such as ONGC and GAIL to private firms. Private LPG retailers, called parallel marketeers, have to use imported gas for supplying to customers. The 2000 Control Order was issued as the nation is short in LPG production.

Once BPCL is privatised, the 2000 order will bar ONGC and GAIL from selling LPG to BPCL, the officials said. ""Post divestment of the government's stake in BPCL, it shall cease to be a government oil company in terms of clause 2(g) of LPG Control Order of 2000,"" an official said.

With no access to indigenously produced LPG, BPCL won't be able to serve its customers and it would not be possible to shift the customers to IOC and HPCL as LPG cylinder equipment at customer end will need to be changed. Also, IOC and HPCL may not have the required infrastructure to cater to such a large customer base, the officials said. As a way out, it is being considered to continue to treat BPCL as a government company for the purpose of the 2000 Control Order for three years, the officials said adding that a legal opinion has been sought to ascertain if such a move is tenable under the law.

The other alternative is to amend the LPG Control Order itself to allow private firms to access indigenously produced LPG. This would open up LPG retailing to other private firms. Officials said law ministry opinion has been sought to determine if the term government oil company in the LPG Control Order necessary requires the company to be a government company and if BPCL post privatisation can be notified as a government oil company.

To interpret the term 'government company', the opinion of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) as well as the Ministry of Consumer Affairs (MoCA) has been sought, they said. MCA because it is the administrative ministry for purposes of administration of the Companies Act, 2013 and MoCA because it is the administrative ministry/department for the purposes of administration of Essential Commodities Act, 1955, under which the LPG Control Order of 2000 was issued.

Officials said the new owner of BPCL will after three years of takeover get a right to decide on retaining the business of selling subsidised LPG. The firm's cooking gas LPG customers will be transferred to IOC and HPCL in case the new owner does not want to continue with such a business, the officials added.

The government gives 12 cooking gas (LPG) cylinders of 14.2-kg each to households in a year at a subsidised rate. There is no subsidy being paid in most parts of the country but a subsidy will be directly paid into the bank accounts of the users in case prices rise steeply. The government is selling its entire 53 per cent stake along with management control in BPCL. The new owner will get 15.33 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and 22 per cent of the fuel marketing share. It also owns 18,652 petrol pumps, 6,166 LPG distributor agencies and 61 out of 260 aviation fuel stations in the country.",722,

If someone does not monetise these resources, new enterprises will have to be brought in (to do so),” Pradhan said during the launch of the third round of auctions for discovered small fields.

What prompted the minister to take a tough stand? Moneycontrol looks into how ONGC and OIL have performed in terms of production over the years.

How India fared in hydrocarbon production?

According to data from the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, domestic crude oil production dipped 20 percent to 30.5 million tonnes (MT) in 2020-21 from 38.1 MT in 2011-12. Even in 1998-99, the earliest year for which data is available, output was 32.8 MT, 7 percent higher than in 2020-21.

Gross production of natural gas slipped 40 percent to 28,670 million metric standard cubic meters (MMSCM) in 2020-21 from 47,555 MMSCM in 2011-12.

While the dismal show in 2020-21 may have been due to the pandemic, crude production was down at 32.2 MT and natural gas at 31,184 MMSCM in 2019-20.

Why is production declining?

A major reason for the declining trend in output is the aging of the fields operated by the public sector undertakings. The companies have also failed to bring large new fields into production.

In addition, India’s hydrocarbon basins are underexplored. Of the 26 sedimentary basins in India covering an area of 3.4 million square km, only nine have been explored.

Another major impediment is the lack of data on potential reserves for undertaking exploration. Based on the latest data, India has in-place resources of about 41.872 billion tonnes of oil equivalent in the 26 sedimentary basins.

How have ONGC and OIL performed?

Crude oil production by ONGC and OIL declined 14 percent to 22 MT in 2020-21 from 25.6 MT in 2011-12. This was a decline of 26 percent from 29.7 MT in 1998-99. ONGC’s output alone declined 28 percent to 19.1 MT in 2020-21 from 26.5 MT in 1998-99.

OIL’s crude production was little changed at 2.9 MT in 2020-21 from 3.3 MT in 1998-99.

Natural gas production by the two companies dropped 6 percent in the past 10 years as demand fell during the pandemic.

According to a plan by the ministry, the government wants ONGC to sell its stake in maturing fields such as Panna-Mukta, Ratna and the R-Series off the Mumbai coast and onshore fields like Gandhar in Gujarat to private companies.

To bring in more technical expertise, it has asked ONGC to tie up with global explorers for the KG-DWN-98/2 block in the Bay of Bengal, where a major increase in output is expected this year or early next year.

For India, natural gas production seems to bring in a glimmer of hope amid this dismal performance. According to government estimates, natural gas production is expected to double to 71.92 billion cubic meters in the next couple of years. A major reason for this would be the new fields in KG basin and those from the first round of the Open Acreage Licensing Policy, which may start in 2025.

The dismal production numbers by the PSUs led the government to look at monetising idle and non-monetised resources, prompting the minister to say that a “chalti ka naam gaadi” (something that is barely working) attitude will not work.",617,-0.5900191843509675

""There will be no DSF next time. Next time, it will be a 'major' round (auction of large fields),"" he said. In these upcoming major rounds, the government will auction unmonetized large oil and gas fields of state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India (OIL).

Moneycontrol looks into the importance of these auctions and what went wrong.

Vision around DSF

It was in 2016, the government decided to attract more private investors into India's hydrocarbon exploration sector by putting the old, small and discovered oil and gas blocks of ONGC and OIL on the block. The event was considered as the entry point for India's future oil and gas barons. The ultimate aim of these rounds was to fast-track the target of reducing the country's import dependency by 10 per cent. Authorities believed that these rounds would attract small players and start-ups also.

How did DSF fare?

The first round saw aggressive bidding by companies from diverse sectors such as steel, power, software, iron ore, textile and education. Raising eyebrows, even Dilip Shanghvi’s Sun Petrochemicals was also interested. In the first round, 22 companies won bids for the 31 contracts on offer, out of which 15 were new entrants to the sector. Government signed contracts with the successful bidders in February 2017. The gross revenue from the first round itself was expected to be around Rs Rs 46,400 crore, while the government's share out of this in the form of royalty and revenue was expected to be around Rs 14,000 crore.

During the first rounds, there was clear instruction from the government that ONGC and OIL should not be part of the DSF rounds. However, during the second round in February 2019, both these state-run majors were among the eight companies that won 23 contract areas. Interestingly, these companies even bid for blocks relinquished by them, taking the sheen away from the much-talked-about DSF rounds. The second round was expected to start production by 2022, which is also likely to get delayed due to the pandemic.

""DSF as a concept was good for small investors to enter into the exploration business. A lot of new entrants came to the scene and now they can graduate to higher bidding rounds like OALP. The government should not have stopped the DSF rounds,"" said D S Rajput, managing director of UAE-based South Asia Consultancy, the only foreign company that won a block under DSF.

What went wrong?

While the first round was a success in terms of participation, what raises concern is the inability of these new entrants to start production in these blocks even after five years. Other than the unpredictability in oil and gas business, these companies failed to get environment and forest clearances or got them at a slow pace.

Lack of coordination between several state governments and the Centre too acted as a roadblock. Though the small players were promised the sharing of infrastructure of companies like ONGC, OIL and Cairn, that too did not take a formal shape. Finally, the pandemic and the resulting drop in international oil prices also affected the capital flow towards such projects. Many of the investors feel better handholding by the government is needed to help such new entrants in future rounds, even if it is a big round.",590,-0.5757826328277588

PESB has decided to constitute a search panel for the appointment of ONGC chairman, which means the company may run without a full-time CMD for at least six more months. After Shashi Shanker retired in March this year, its director (finance) Subhash Kumar was given the additional charge of CMD. Kumar will superannuate by the end of December 2021.

The prospects of a private-sector executive getting the top job has sparked a debate on the merits of bring an “outsider” to head ONGC, which has seen output from its ageing fields decline constantly. This has hit India’s oil output as the company accounts for 70 percent of domestic production.

""If a private sector player comes into action, that may bring a lot of change to the way ONGC functions. Furthermore, the new CMD will be under pressure to perform, which may increase ONGC's production, which is on a downward trend,” according to an official from a private sector oil and gas company.

A former ONGC official had a different view: ""ONGC requires someone from inside, as an outside player may not understand the work culture. I believe the acting chairman, Kumar, is running the show efficiently. Among those who were in the race, Pomila Jaspal was the number one in terms of seniority. The government may have the option to look for a bureaucrat also,"" he said.

Industry veterans say the ONGC officers’ union may oppose the appointment of someone from the private sector.

Another industry player said that the government may consider splitting the CMD’s position and pick a bureaucrat as chairman and someone from the private sector as managing director.

The 10 candidates who were rejected for the post of chairman and managing director include two were Indian Administrative Service Officers Avinash Joshi and Niraj Verma, from the 1994 batch belonging to the Assam-Meghalaya cadre. The other known names for the post include Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) director-finance Pomila Jaspal, ONGC director (technology and field services) Om Prakash Singh and Container Corporation of India director-finance Manoj Kumar Dubey. The remaining candidates include Security Printing and Minting Corp of India Ltd director-finance Ajay Agarwal, ONGC additional director general Anand Gupta and ONGC executive directors Sandeep Gupta, Pankaj Kumar and Omkar Nath Gyani. Later, PESB picked Pankaj Kumar for the post of Director (Offshore) from the list of seven candidates.

This is not the first time that applicants for the position of ONGC chairman have been turned down. In 2006, though PESB had recommended R S Sharma, the then director of finance of the company, as its chairman, the Prime Minister's Office had rejected the appointment.

Interestingly, Najeeb Jung, who resigned from the Indian Administrative Service in 1999, was considered to be leading the race for the job of ONGC chairman once the search committee was appointed. He was at the Oxford Institute of Energy studies at that time. However, ONGC veteran Sharma was appointed as the chairman after PESB recommended his name once again. Jung later went on to become the 20th Lieutenant Governor of Delhi from July 2013 to December 2016.

The appointment of ONGC chairman was delayed as PESB had no chairman till April this year. In PESB too, for the first time, a private sector specialist was appointed as its head when Mallika Srinivasan, Chairman and Managing Director of Tractors and Farm Equipment (TAFE) was appointed as chairman in April.",615,-0.9999790191650391

At least three executive directors were suspended after a preliminary probe by the management, while disciplinary action was also taken against some officials.

The disciplinary actions include transfer from the existing posts and issuing show-cause notices, said sources.

The ONGC Officers’ Association has already approached the management and has written a letter to the management and Subhash Kumar, who holds the charge of the Chairman and Managing Director.

The Association is of the opinion that the fault lies on part of the operators of the barge and ONGC had given necessary warnings to them in advance, said a company source.

Officials are also upset with the fact that no action has been taken against the contractor, Afcons International.

When asked about this, a source said, “Suspension cannot be considered as an action. It was done to make sure that a fair investigation occurs in the case. In case of whether Afcons is at fault or not, the Ministry of Petroleum has set up an enquiry committee and any further action will be taken based on their report.”

There were reports that the ONGC may have ignored an email from the desk officer of barge P-305 seeking guidance on steps to be taken to ensure the safety of the 261 personnel on board.

However, ONGC claims that it had taken all necessary steps and followed all safety protocols after the warning by the Indian Coast Guard.

According to the oil major, there were 99 floating installations in the region when the cyclone warning was issued. Following the warnings by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and ONGC, 94 out of 99 vessels were shifted to safe locations at sea and ashore.

Out of 7,675 personnel, 6,961 stayed safe at their respective locations. However, the remaining five vessels (carrying 714 personnel) faced an adverse situation.

The company claims that it is the contractor’s fault that has led to the situation as all the other vessels followed the instructions to move to safe shores.

On the other hand, the contractor Afcons International held the barge owner Durmast and the master of the barge responsible for the accidents.

Afcons had said that as per the normal marine protocol, as well as the specific charter agreement for P305, matters concerning vessel safety lie with the owner and the barge master, who is in the best position to decide on the appropriate course of action regarding vessel safety.",439,-0.8078116029500961

The race for the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) chairman's post has captured headlines with the presence of two senior bureaucrats – Avinash Joshi and Niraj Verma.

However, the selection interview on June 4 is also interesting because four out of the total 10 candidates who have applied for the ONGC chairman and managing director's post are also in the fray for the post of director (offshore) of ONGC.

Interestingly, the Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB) has called the candidates for both the high profile posts on the same day (June 4) -- at 9.30 am chairman’s post and at 3.30 pm for the director (offshore).

A total of ten candidates are in the race for the post of ONGC chairman. This includes two Indian Administrative Service Officers Avinash Joshi and Niraj Verma, from the 1994 batch belonging to Assam-Meghalaya cadre, both serving as principal secretaries in the government of Assam.

Interestingly, Sandeep Gupta, Pankaj Kumar, Omkar Nath Gyani and Anand Gupta are among the shortlisted candidates for the post of director (offshore). This means, even if they are edged out in the race for ONGC chairmanship, they have a second chance the same day to become a top director of the country’s largest oil and gas producer.

The company is already in the process of seeking an exemption for the successful bidder from mandatory open offer to be made to shareholders of Petronet LNG and Indraprastha Gas Ltd., in which BPCL is a promoter.

According to a source, the government is unlikely to favour an exemption for BPCL, unlike the case when Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) acquired Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) it was exempted from making an open offer to minority shareholders because both firms had the same promoter, the government of India.

BPCL holds around a 12.5 percent stake in Petronet LNG and 22.5 percent in IGL. A source said the government may be in favour of the company equally selling its stake to other public sector undertakings in Petronet – including Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Gail India and ONGC, all holding 12.5 per cent each. The government is keen on BPCL giving away its promoter status in these two companies, he said.

If BPCL remains a promoter of Petronet and IGL, the private entity that acquires the government’s stake will have to make an open offer for another 26 per cent stake in both the companies as per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) guidelines. This is likely to raise the acquisition cost of BPCL by Rs 20,000 crore, which may discourage potential bidders.

“If shares are being sold to other state-run companies, the process of divestment may get further delayed by another six months at least, as it may need several clearances including those from the respective boards,” he said.

For the year 2021-22,

The government set a divestment target of Rs 1.75 lakh crore for 2021-22 – Rs 1 lakh crore from selling stakes in public sector banks and financial institutions and Rs 75,000 crore from divesting equity in public sector companies. The target is higher than the Rs 32,835 crore the government from divestment last year. Hence, the divestment of BPCL is considered to be a key in achieving the current year’s divestment target.

Industry experts also say COVID-19 may be another spoiler for the divestment process.

Parties interested in BPCL will soon be given access to a ‘clean data room’ of the company that may include commercially sensitive information too. Already, a virtual data room was opened in the month of April.

Three potential bidders, including Vedanta Group and two private equity funds -- Apollo Global and I Squared Capital --have expressed interest in BPCL. Based on the current market cap, Centre’s 52.98 per cent stake in BPCL is valued at around Rs 54,000 crore.",488,-0.7727482616901398

Out of the 274 people missing, including 261 from P-305 and 13 from Varaprada, on May 17, 188 were rescued. Seventy bodies were recovered during the initial search-and-rescue operation. Out of the remaining 16 people, eight bodies were reportedly recovered along the coast at Raigarh district in Maharashtra and eight Brave Nature's Victim (BNVs) were found along the Gujarat coast near Valsad in the last 24 hours.

Thus, all missing 274 crew members have been accounted for. On May 24 morning, tug Varaprada was located during an underwater search by INS Makar. “Diving is in progress to locate trapped BNVs, if any,” he said.

How did it happen?

In the early hours of May 17, Cyclone Tauktae hit the Arabian Sea off the coast of Mumbai, where ONGC’s major production installations and drilling rigs are located. Three construction barges of Afcons working on an ONGC project in Western Offshore fields in the Arabian Sea and one floater drilling rig were severely affected.

When all the anchors of the P-305 gave way, it started drifting and hit an unmanned platform of ONGC, resulting in water ingress, and it eventually capsized around 5 pm on May 17.

“ONGC OSVs (Offshore Supply Vessels) were immediately pressed into service for rescue operations, along with INS Kochi and INS Kolkata of the Indian Navy and a Coast Guard vessel.

There were a total of 13 members in Varaprada, which is operated by Gal Constructor.

The Indian Navy, while on its rescue mission for Pappa 305, found two of its crew members mid-sea.

When contacted, an Indian Navy official said that it is not in charge of Varaprada’s rescue mission, and the Indian Coast Guard is looking into it.

An ONGC official confirmed that the vessel is yet to be identified. According to marinetraffic.com, the vessel is out of range and was last reported on May 17 at around 9.24 am.

“Search operations for 11 members of Varaprada, the anchor handling boat of Gal Constructor carrying, are also going on,” said the official.

The Coast Guard was not reachable for comment.

In five floating vessels involved in the mid-sea mishap, casualties have so far been reported in P-305.

The accident claimed 51 lives, and 24 people are still missing. The incident occurred in the early hours of May 17, when Cyclone Tauktae hit Arabian Sea off the coast of Mumbai, where ONGC’s major production installations and drilling rigs are located. The wind speed rose to nearly 150-180 km/hour, with 6-8-metre high waves. Due to a combination of weather factors, four vessels that the ONGC put into service went adrift in the high seas.

With the blame game intensifying on the issue, an ONGC official said that there were 99 floating rigs and barges at the location, and only five were in trouble. This shows that the operators may be at fault, he said.

ONGC claims it had taken all necessary steps and followed all safety protocols after the warning by the Coast Guard. “That’s why around a hundred vessels working in that vicinity have been saved and there is no casualty. The damage occurred only to the three contracted (charter-hired) vessels where safety is the contractor’s responsibility. ONGC had asked them to follow the SOP (standard operating procedure). We are awaiting the findings of the investigation ordered,” said an official.

On the other hand, Afcons International, which is a contractor, is putting the onus on barge owner Durmast and on the master of the barge.

Based on preliminary findings, there were 342 installations -- 243 fixed and 99 floating -- in the region. Around 7,675 people were working there. Following the warnings by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and ONGC, 94 out of 99 vessels shifted to safe locations at sea and ashore.

“Based on the weather warning, ONGC activated its emergency response system and instructed all installations to take action as per the SOP. Complying with the same, appropriate actions, including staying at safe mode or returning to safe locations to the anchoring points, were taken by the respective installations. Out of 7,675 personnel, 6,961 stayed safe at respective locations. However, the remaining five vessels (carrying 714 personnel) faced adverse situation,” said a source.

There were 261 people in vessel P305. So far, only 186 have been rescued.

Out of the 13, two were rescued while search for remaining 11 is on. Interestingly, out of the five vessels involved, Sagar Bhushan is owned by ONGC.

While ONGC is blaming the operator, Afcons says the barge operation is the duty of its owner, Durmast Enterprises, and the master of P305, Balwinder Singh. It reportedly said that the master decided to move the barge only 200 metres away from the platform where it was operating. despite other vessels moving to safer locations.

According to experts, it may well be an error in judgement on the part of the master of the vessel or the company in charge of the operations that might have claimed the lives of so many workers.

“Everyone was made aware of the cyclone and warnings were sent to take precautions. Then why did ONGC not follow protocols? They should have evacuated all their workers from the barges,” said Nawab Malik, Maharashtra minister.

ONGC had blamed the mishap to the change in direction of the cyclone and an unexpected increase in wind speed. This claim was rejected by the IMD on May 20.

Moneycontrol looks at the action that ONGC and its contractor Afcons International did after they were alerted about the cyclone.

Warning received on cyclone alert

Afcons said the onus of operations is on Durmast, the owner of the barge. According to industry experts, the barge should have been already shifted to a safe location after the alert.

Published weather reports, including cyclone alerts, are for the general region of operation, and not particularly for any exact area of operation. A standard practice of offshore contractors is to obtain a weather forecast for the work location from well-known weather forecasters, which are typically issued twice a day, and provide weather forecasts for the next seven days.

Marine, as well as construction operations, are planned based on the location-specific forecasts. The same practice was followed by Afcons, the company said.

The weather forecasts received on May 14 predicted that sustained wind speed of a maximum of 40 knots (classified as a tropical storm) is likely to occur at a specific work location late on May 16 and on May 17.

Preventive and precautionary measures

According to Afcons, after receiving the alert, it directed all vessels to secure their respective work locations and move to a safe location at the earliest. Accordingly, all vessels and barges, including P305, commenced moving out of their work locations on May 14 and May 15.

“While the other barges moved to Mumbai Port / Mumbai Outer Anchorage / Anchorage close to Revandanda, the master of P305 chose to move 200 metres away from the HT platform, where the Barge P305 was working, and to remain at that location, deciding it as a safe location since the maximum predicted wind speed was only 40 knots and his location was 120 nautical miles away from the eye of the tropical storm,” Afcons said.

Despite this, the weather conditions deteriorated rapidly from the evening of May 16, reaching levels far worse than predicted. “The sudden deterioration of weather left no time at all for any further action to be taken by the master of the vessel,” it said.

The company added that as per the normal marine protocol, as well as the specific charter agreement for P305, matters concerning vessel safety lie under the responsibility of the owner and the barge master, who is in the best position to decide on the appropriate course of action regarding vessel safety, as he has the necessary skill sets as well as the understanding of his vessel and its equipment.

Afcons had chartered the vessel from Durmast. Durmast is the owner and the responsibility for marine operations rests with the vessel owner and his marine crew stationed on the vessel. “As per the international standards, vessel-chartering terms which were adopted for the charter of P305, the responsibility for the marine side of the operations, namely safe-vessel operation, navigation and vessel management come under the scope of work of the vessel owners, carried out through the vessel’s master, officers, and the crew appointed on the vessel by the owner,” Afcons said.

According to rescue workers, hopes are running out with each passing hour as it will be difficult for someone to sustain without food or water in mid-sea braving extreme weather conditions with the help of a life jacket. Cyclone Tauktae hit the Arabian Sea off the coast of Mumbai in the early hours of May 17, 2021, where ONGC’s major production installations and drilling rigs are located. Leading to one of the largest mid-sea rescue operations by the Indian Navy and Coast Guard, ONGC’s barge Papaa (P305) sank in the Arabian Sea nearly 35 nautical miles off the Mumbai coast, after water gushed into it.

At the time of the accident, there were around 261 people present in the barge, out of which only 186 are rescued by the Indian Navy so far. Total 75 people were missing and so far only 37 people are confirmed dead, said a source. Search operations are still on for the remaining 38 people.

According to a source from ONGC, the cyclone changed its path. In addition to that, unprecedented wind speed due to unexpected low pressure led to the tragedy, despite ONGC taking all the safety measures. Today, The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has rejected claims that the cyclone had changed its path.

The ministry of petroleum and natural gas has already constituted a three-member panel to look into the sequence of events that led to the sinking of the vessel. The committee includes Amitabh Kumar, director general of shipping, SCL Das, Director General of Hydrocarbons and Nazli Jafri Shayin, joint secretary with the ministry of defence.

Of the total of 261 present on the Barge, around 186 have been rescued so far, said an official source close to the development.

Cyclone Tauktae, considered to be the most severe storm in the last five decades, caused grave damage to Barge P-305, which was located 35 nautical miles from Mumbai (in the Mumbai Offshore Development Area).

An Indian Navy official told Moneycontrol that INS Kochi and INS Kolkata are returning to Mumbai harbour with the evacuees.

On the other hand, other carriers like INS Teg, INS Betwa, INS Beas, P8I aircraft and a Seaking Helos are continuing with search and rescue operations.

The accommodation Barge had workers who were part of an ONGC project contracted to a consortium of companies led by Afcons International.

Afcons told Moneycontrol that all the cyclone-related standard operating procedures (SOPs) were followed by the company. In a statement, they said that the chartered Barge P-305 along with its marine crew was owned and operated by Durmast Enterprises.

When the Barge sent out a distress call after experiencing flooding and water ingress, a total of 261 people were on board.

""We are facing a weather challenge too. INS Kochi was near when the distress alarm was sent out. However, rescue operations were dampened by the extreme weather conditions then. We are continuing to nurture the hope that more people will be saved,"" said another source.

The sea continues to be extremely rough with Sea state 4-5 and winds at 25-30 knots (approximately 35 - 55 kmph), posing a challenge to the ships and aircraft involved in the operations.

In another operation, an Indian Navy Seaking helicopter was launched to rescue the crew of GAL Constructor, which ran aground North of Mumbai.

It reportedly had around 137 crew members on board. ""ONGC, Indian Navy, Coast Guard, Afcons and the government are coordinating the rescue efforts,"" said another source.

“Due to the severe cyclonic storm, unfortunate incidences have occurred involving three construction barges of M/s Afcons working on a project of ONGC in Western Offshore fields in the Arabian Sea and one drilling rig of ONGC deployed for exploration purpose (sic),” it said.

The company said it was taking all possible measures in coordination with ODAG (Offshore Defence Advisory Group) and MRCC (Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre) to ensure the safety of personnel and vessels.

On the other hand, anchors of the barge ‘Support Station-3’ gave away and it started drifting North-West following the cyclone. “It is clear of all operational Installations of Mumbai High.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on Monday said it will procure one lakh oxygen concentrators to aid India's fight against the world's worst outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.

The company will use its understanding of the global supply chain and logistics to procure one lakh oxygen concentrators on behalf of the government of India, ONGC said in a statement.

The government of India will bear the cost of procuring these concentrators.

""Within a short period, ONGC placed orders for 34,673 oxygen concentrators on overseas vendors for immediate supply. Out of these, 2,900 are expected to be received by May 21, and the rest in staggered delivery from May to the end of June 2021.

""Further, to promote domestic capacity, the order has been placed for 40,000 units of oxygen concentrators on domestic manufacturers,"" it said

In addition, medical-grade oxygen generation plants are also being set up with ONGC support in 10 government hospitals in three states.

This is part of the 93 oxygen plants oil PSUs are setting up across the country.

""Continuing its fight against COVID, ONGC has been an active part of the nation-wide vaccination drive promoting the vaccination efforts through regular social media posts. ONGC is also organizing vaccination camps at various work locations across the country for employees and secondary workforce,"" it said.

To ensure that vaccination reaches the people of the country, ONGC has also supported COVID vaccine logistics supply chain equipment in Tripura, Nagaland, Gujarat, and Uttarakhand.

ONGC said its employees have been at the forefront of combating the pandemic since its onset in March 2020.

""Amidst restrictions to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, ONGCians have maintained production of oil and gas to ensure the nation's energy supply,"" the statement.

The company further noted that ""the Energy Soldiers of ONGC worked extended operational shifts (in offshore and remote onshore oil-field locations) of up to 60 days at a stretch on their own volition (in place of the usual 14/21 days on/off duty pattern) to sustain production during the period when the crew changeover process was hampered for the nation-wide lockdown.""

“At least 32 contract areas will be on offer under DSF-III. This includes 22 offshore and 10 onshore fields, which may have reserves to the tune of around 250 million metric tonnes of oil equivalent,” a source said Moneycontrol.

When asked, a senior official from the Directorate General of Hydrocarbon declined to comment.

DSF rounds are considered as an entry point for India’s potential oil and gas barons, by offering small blocks that were surrendered by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India (OIL).

By 2022, these rounds were also intended to reduce India's oil imports by 10 per cent.

“After DSF Bid Round-I (2016) & DSF Bid Round-II (2018), the Government is coming up with DSF Bid Round-III (2021) where unexploited discoveries will be offered for International Competitive Bidding,” DGH said in a Tweet.

During the first round of DSF held in 2016, 22 companies won bids for the 31 contracts on offer; of them, 15 were new entrants to the oil and gas business.

Interestingly, companies from sectors as diverse as steel, power, software, iron ore, textile and education turned up to bid.

However, during the second round, 23 contract areas were awarded to eight companies.

The participation of ONGC and OIL during the second round had raised eyebrows as the blocks were previously surrendered by the same companies.

None of the blocks from the first two rounds have started production yet, with some still stuck in getting clearances from the environment, forests, and wildlife departments.

While production from the first round was expected to start by 2019-20, those from the second round were scheduled to begin by 2022. Due to the COVID-19 related delay, production from these blocks is expected to be delayed.",321,-0.04306119680404663

About 75-80 people, out of the total 230 or around 35 percent of the workforce, have been infected by COVID-19 in Heera, one of ONGC’s largest producing platforms. Out of this, 28 are ONGC employees. The rest are contract workers.

The company claims production is unaffected and maintains that it is continuing to produce 50,000 barrels of oil per day from the platform. An ONGC spokesperson declined to comment on the development.

A source, who is working offshore, told Moneycontrol that only two rigs out of the six in the area are currently operational.

“In a rig called Sagar Uday, almost 60-70 people were tested positive, and, hence, the rig got blacked out. Similarly, work was stopped in Sagar Ratna, Sagar Kiran and Sagar Shakthi, too. In Heera too, it seems production is affected,” the source said.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

However, another source indicated that production is not affected at Heera. Regarding the stoppage of operations in rigs, the source added that it may not affect production as a majority of them are used for exploratory purposes.

A rig is used for mainly exploration purpose. Platforms are permanent structures on seabed for production.

What is making life difficult for ONGC is how to contain the spread of the virus in a small area.

The company managed to maintain its production status owing to a set of health protocols being maintained in offshore operations. Those affected and those who came in close contact with those affected are being transported immediately to the base in helicopters.

The company has maintained a strict standard operating procedure ever since the pandemic broke out. Any person, whether employee or contract worker, has to go through a mandatory five-day quarantine and also an RT-PCR test before being shifted offshore.

The company has also posted a team of doctors on all its platforms, and, hence, temperature and other health parameters of the employees are checked on a routine basis.

“If somebody is found having some symptoms, the person is immediately sent back to the base. All those coming into contact with that person are also isolated. If the person turns out to be negative, then people who are in isolation are allowed to work. Otherwise, we sent a team of doctors and paramedics to collect the blood samples of those quarantined, too,” the source added.

At present, those working offshore are managing the production intact. The company is of the view that no immediate replacement is required as shifts keep changing.

Prior to COVID, shifts in offshore operations were for 14 days. This has increased to 28 days now. “Right now, the production is not affected by COVID in Heera, but there is a huge maintenance job going on and that is why one of the platforms is shut there. That is a planned shutdown,” he added.",778,-0.5315175652503967

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on Monday invited bids for the sale of initial 2 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from its KG basin fields at a minimum price of USD 6.6 per mmBtu.

According to the tender document, ONGC intends to start natural gas sale from its KG-DWN-98/2 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL)-BP Plc operated KG-D6 fields, from June-end.



Initially, 2 million standard cubic metres per day of gas has been offered for sale through an e-auction.

ONGC has sought bids indexed to Brent crude oil. Bids have been sought at a minimum of 10.5 per cent of the three-month average Brent crude oil price.

At the current Brent crude oil price of USD 63, the minimum price comes to USD 6.6 per million British thermal unit.

This price, however, will be subject to the ceiling or cap fixed by the government for deepsea fields every six months. The cap for six months beginning April 1 is USD 3.62 per mmBtu.

This essentially means that bidders may corner gas by offering to pay USD 7, but the buyers will have to pay no more than the ceiling price of USD 3.62.

A senior ONGC official said the ceiling price is expected to rise to USD 5.5-5.6 at the next revision due on October 1.

""The current ceiling price is one-third less than the bare minimum cost of production from a deepsea field. After including the cost of money as well as margin, gas price should be USD 6 and not USD 3.62,"" he said.

Earlier this month, Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner BP Plc of UK sought bids for the sale of 5.5 mmscmd of additional natural gas that will be available for sale from their eastern offshore KG-D6 block.

The e-auction is slated for April 23 and the gas supply will start from late April or early May, according to the tender document.

Bidders will have to quote a price linked to Platts JKM (Japan Korea marker) - the liquefied natural gas (LNG) benchmark price assessment for spot physical cargoes.

The lowest bid that can be placed is JKM minus USD 0.3 per million British thermal unit. The highest acceptable bid would be JKM plus USD 2.01 per mmBtu.

This is the same benchmark RIL-BP had used in February to sell out 7.5 mmscmd of gas from the block.

At the current price, the lowest price for the 5.5 mmscmd of gas that RIL-BP are auctioning comes to near USD 6.5 per mmBtu.

But just like ONGC, RIL-BP too is entitled to a maximum of USD 3.62 per mmBtu ceiling fixed by the government for a six-month period to September 30.

ONGC's KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block is expected to have a peak production rate of 15.25 mmscmd of natural gas and 80,000 barrels per day of oil.

The company is likely to come out with another tender later this year for the sale of 5 mmscmd of gas from next year.

However, gas produced from difficult fields was seen down by 11 percent for the period, as compared to October to March period. According to a notification by the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), the price of domestic natural gas for the period of April 1 to September 30 in 2021 was kept at $1.79 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) on a gross calorific value basis.

For natural gas produced from deepwater, ultra-deepwater and high-pressure high-temperature areas, the price was set at $3.62 per mmBtu. This was 10.8 per cent lower than $4.06 per mmBtu set during the October to March period of the financial year 2020-21.

Natural gas prices are decided in India once in every six months based on a formula depending on the weighted average of global benchmarks like Henry Hub, Alberta gas, NBP and Russian gas.

State-owned ONGC, which is often perceived as a drag on the crude oil and natural gas produced in the country, has actually seen its contribution to the national production jump to over 70 per cent from under 53 per cent a decade back, petroleum ministry data showed.

While Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) maintained production levels, output by other operators has dropped, leading to an overall fall in India''s output and a sharp rise in import dependency.

Its standalone production at 47.51 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2010-11 was 52.8 per cent of a total of 89.91 million tonnes of oil and gas produced in the country that year, the data showed.

Despite having majority of fields where natural decline has set after being in operations for more than four decades, ONGC maintained production throughout the last decade thereafter and had an output of 44.57 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2019-20, which was 70.3 per cent of India''s total production of 63.353 million tonnes.

ONGC''s output dropped to 43.54 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2015-16 (62.9 per cent of India''s total production) but new discoveries as well as massive investment in extracting last drop from the ageing fields arrested further fall and even led to a marginal increase.

Even when its production dropped when compared to previous year, ONGC''s share in total production of crude oil and natural gas in the country continued to rise, the data which formed part of the review taken by the ministry a couple of weeks back, showed.

ONGC is focused on finding oil and gas reserves in Category II and III Basins, which do not have established hydrocarbon proficiency.

This helped accrete inplace reserves of 2,246 million tonnes of oil between 2002 and 2015 and ultimate accretion of 1,014 million tonnes, the data presented at the review showed.

Of this, ONGC realised 830 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas as production. It has approved 14 schemes for developing 135 million tonnes of reserves.

ONGC''s share in national production rose from 52.8 per cent in 2010-11 to 54.9 per cent in the following year and to 58.7 per cent in 2012-13, 62.2 per cent in 2013-14, 62.3 per cent in 2014-15, 62.9 per cent in 2015-16 and 65.3 per cent in 2016-17.

In subsequent years it was 67 per cent, 68.4 per cent and 70.3 per cent in 2019-20 -- the latest year for which data was presented at the review.

During this 10-year period, India''s dependence on imported crude oil to meet its demand rose from about two-third to 85 per cent.

ONGC discovered and put to production seven out of the eight producing basins of India covering 83 per cent of established oil and gas reserves.

In December last year, it opened India''s eighth hydrocarbon producing basin when it started oil flow from a well in the Bengal basin. Oil India Ltd (OIL) is responsible for putting into production one basin in Assam.",517,0.1683356285095215

The Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) has announced strategic divestment of 26 percent of its equity holding in Indian Gas Exchange (IGX) to National Stock Exchange (NSE) and an additional 5 percent equity holding to state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC).

The representatives of IEX, NSE and ONGC signed agreements to this effect in the presence of Tarun Kapoor, Secretary of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. IGX is India’s first gas exchange after it secured authorisation from Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) on December 2, 2020.

NSE has done the deal through its wholly-owned subsidiary NSE Investments . The Indian Gas Exchange is a subsidiary of the IEX - India’s premier nationwide, automated electricity trading platform powered by intuitive and state-of-the-art technology.

Speaking on the development, Shri Tarun Kapoor, Secretary, MOPNG said, “We are working collaboratively with key stakeholders in the value chain to create an enabling policy framework that supports the development of gas markets in the country. The Indian Gas Exchange, working in collaboration with strong leaders from both the public as well as the private sector, has a pioneering role in developing a vibrant gas market in the country.”

S N Goel, Chairman and Managing Director, IEX and Director, IGX said, “Both NSE and ONGC bring their unique value proposition and leadership edge in markets and hydrocarbon sector respectively to the table. We look forward to working jointly with our new partners in developing gas markets which offer an immense scope of growth.""

Earlier this year, IEX announced the strategic investments of 5 percent each by leading players in the gas value chain – Adani Total Gas, Torrent Gas and GAIL (India) Ltd in IGX. Vikram Limaye, managing director and chief executive officer, NSE, said, “The Government of India has an unwavering commitment to increase the consumption of gas and build India as a gas-based economy.

India will line up 10 oil and gas blocks under the sixth round of Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) for domestic and international hydrocarbon players, SCL Das, Director General, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons has said.

State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) had won seven out of 11 geographical areas on offer under the fifth bidding round held last year under the OALP. Oil India (OIL) won the remaining four blocks.

OALP Round V is expected to generate an immediate exploration work commitment of around $400-450 million. On the other hand, the first four rounds are expected to generate an investment of approximately $2.35 billion over the next three to four years in exploratory work alone.

Addressing international energy summit CERA Week 2021, he said the country wants more international investors to participate in the OALP and Discovered Small Fields (DSF) rounds.

Amar Nath, joint secretary at the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas added that the next round of small field auctions is expected to happen within the next two months.

Das indicated that for foreign players India will open up opportunities as demand is constantly on a rise in the country. According to data available with the DGH, demand for crude oil is likely to double from 5 million barrels per day now to 10 billion barrels by 2050. Similarly, the demand for natural gas may also increase to 241 billion cubic meter (bcm) by 2050 from around 58 bcm now.

“To move towards this, we have lined up several policy reforms including revenue sharing model and unified licensing policy. Moreover, we have also introduced several fiscal incentive schemes,” he said.",311,0.9994569420814514

Emkay Global Financial's report on ONGC

We reiterate our Buy rating and OW stance on ONGC on the back of buoyant oil prices and potential overhaul in nominated block (APM) gas pricing. Brent prices have risen to USD65/bbl, driven by demand recovery, OPEC+ cuts, stimulus and extreme cold weather. Arrival of summer-driving season in US-Europe and shift to personal mobility should support oil prices further. Hence, there is upside risk to our USD55/bbl Brent assumption for FY22. Subsidy risk based on Union Budget and LPG price hikes is low in our view. ONGC management has remained upbeat on the government agreeing to remunerative gas pricing, which should at least cover the USD3.5-3.7/mmbtu cost of production. Every USD1/mmbtu rise in APM rate implies Rs2.6/sh EPS increase for the company.



Outlook

We value ONGC at 4x FY23E EV/EBITDA to arrive at Rs130 TP, assuming USD2.3/2.7 APM prices for FY22/23. Under a blue sky scenario - USD60/bbl Brent, USD3.5/mmbtu gas price and KG-DWN-98/2 ramp up, FV comes above Rs170/sh.

India's top exploration company Oil and Natural Gas Corp hopes to produce 15 million cubic metres of gas a day (mmscmd) in 2024 from its block in the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin, off India's east coast, its head of finance Subhash Kumar said on Monday

India, the world's fourth biggest importer of liquefied natural gas, wants to boost local gas output as Prime Minister Narendra has set a target to raise the share of the cleaner fuel in the country's energy mix to 15 percent by 2030 from the current 6 percent.

Most of the future gas production is expected from the Krishna Godavari basin, where ONGC and Reliance Industries operate blocks. Reliance aims to produce 30 mmscmd gas by 2023 from its assets in the basin.

ONGC will ramp up production from its KG basin block to about 3-3.5 mmscmd from May, which will be further raised to 8.5 mmscmd in 2022/23 before hitting peak rate in 2024, Kumar said.

Combined output of Reliance and ONGC will be about 60 percent of the average 77 mmscmd Indian companies produced in April-December 2020.

To make its gas business profitable ONGC has floated a new subsidiary and expects government to raise local prices.

Current local gas prices of $1.79/million British thermal units (mmBtu) have hit ONGC's revenue. The company's production cost is $3.5-$3.7/mmBtu, he said.

The company will spin-off its entire gas business into the new subsidiary. ONGC holds stake in downstream gas assets and overseas gas blocks either directly or through its subsidiaries.

Kumar said the new subsidiary will bid for gas produced by ONGC for use in the group's refining and petrochemical plans.

""As far as coming years are concerned the story of gas is going to unfold which is going to be critical for the sustained positive performance of the company,"" Kumar said.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on Saturday reported over 67 percent fall in the December quarter net profit on back of a drop in oil and gas prices.

Standalone net profit in October-December quarter at Rs 1,378 crore was 67.4 percent lower than Rs 4,226 crore net profit in the same quarter of the previous year, the company said in a statement here.

The company realised $43.9 on every barrel of crude oil it produced and sold in the third quarter of the current fiscal, down from $58.24 a barrel it had realised in the same period a year back. Government-mandated gas price dropped to $1.79 per million British thermal unit from $3.23 per mmBtu rate it got in October-December 2019.

Turnover was down 28 percent at Rs 17,024 crore.

The company board at its meeting on Saturday approved interim dividend of 35 percent – Rs 1.75 on each equity share of Rs 5.

""The total payout on this account will be Rs 2,201.55 crore,"" the statement said.

Also, the board approved formation of a new wholly-owned subsidiary company for focusing on gas and LNG business value chain subject to necessary approvals.

""The company is being formed with the objective of sourcing, marketing and trading of natural gas, LNG business, Hydrogen enriched CNG (HCNG), gas to power business, bio-energy/ bio-gas/ bio methane/ other biofuels business, etc,"" the statement said.

ONGC said its board has also approved acquisition of 5 percent equity in Indian Gas Exchange Ltd (IGX) as strategic investment.

IGX is a subsidiary of IEX, India's first and leading power exchange. IGX Ltd is presently India's first and only authorized gas exchange, which provides an automated platform for trading of natural gas, covering a wide range of products.

""As an important stakeholder in the gas sector, it would be critical for ONGC to participate at the gas exchange for development of the gas sector. ONGC's interests towards realizing maximum value from its gas marketing efforts may be substantiated through this first gas trading platform in the country,"" it said.

This partnership, ONGC said, is expected to play a role in achieving the Government of India's vision for increasing the share of natural gas from 6 percent to 15 percent in India's energy basket.

ONGC declared a total of eight discoveries (3 in onland, 5 in offshore) during FY2020-21 in its operated acreages. Out of these, 4 are prospects (1 in onland, 3 in offshore) and 4 are pools (2 in onland, 2 in offshore).

The company in December opened the Bengal Basin, the 8th producing basin of India. With the beginning of production from Asokenagar in West Bengal, ONGC has discovered seven out of eight producing basins of the country, covering 83 percent of established oil and gas reserves.

""ONGC's exploratory asset in Silchar has monetized the Bhubandar field on December 7, 2020 by connecting the well BU-7 to South Banskandi GCS (Gas Compressor Station).

The Union Budget 2021-22 has proposed a higher capital outlay for energy companies. While the oil and gas sector saw an increase of 5 percent, the power sector saw an increase of 19 percent compared to the revised estimates (RE) of FY21.

For the next financial year, investment in state-run oil and gas companies is pegged at Rs 104,870 crore, up from Rs 99,650 based on the revised estimates of FY21. However, it is lower than Rs 107,154 crore earmarked in FY20.

Similarly, investment in the power sector in FY22 is pegged at Rs 59,990 - Rs 9,600 crore more than the last fiscal.

The capital outlay for Oil and Natural gas Corporation (ONGC) is down 8 percent at Rs 29,800 crore against Rs 32,501 crore during the current financial year. Another energy giant, National Thermal Power Corporation’s (NTPC) outlay was up 13 percent to Rs 23,736 crore.

In the exploration and production segment under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, that includes companies like ONGC and Oil India, overall investment declined by 6 percent to Rs 49,435 crore.

On the other hand, refinery and marketing segment saw an increase of 17 percent to Rs 49,803 crore, with a considerable increase in the outlay of companies like Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL).

The overall outlay for IOC was seen at Rs 28,546 crore, up 9 percent from Rs 26,305 crore in the RE of FY21. The investment in HPCL was up 21 percent for the year under review to Rs 14,500 crore, compared to Rs 12,000 crore during the current fiscal.

Divestment-bound Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) saw an increase of 10 percent in its capital expenditure for the year to Rs 7,740 crore.

Though India is still in nascent stages as far as Carbon Capture is concerned, some companies are already using this technology in their industrial units.

What is Carbon Capture?

It is the process through which carbon dioxide is captured from large emission sources, thereby recycling it for other purposes and reducing emissions. According to experts, Carbon Capture is not new technology, but it got attention recently owing to the renewed focus on climate change.

What is the use of this process in India?

In India, state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) tied up with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in 2019 to use carbon dioxide captured from Koyali refinery in Gujarat for enhanced oil recovery (EoR) in ONGC fields. Injecting carbon dioxide for EoR is a widely-used technology by oil and gas companies globally. EoR is used in those oil fields which are in their final stages of production and production is difficult through normal means. NALCO too at its Angul facility is doing carbon sequestration through micro-algae cultivation. In September 2020, Tata Steel and Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) had signed a deal to collaborate in the area of Carbon Capture, Utilisation & Storage (CCUS).

""Carbon Capture technology is used for a while in India too. However, the major issue with this is that it is not economically viable. The cost of Carbon Capture runs into $500-600 a tonne, making it less attractive for industrial players,"" said Priyavrat Bhati, Sector Head in Climate, Environment, and Sustainability at the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP).

How renewable sources may kill Carbon Capture

According to experts, another reason why Carbon Capture did not gather momentum is because of the rise in renewable energy.

""The technology was suited for coal-fired power plants and steel plants for a country like India, that is heavily dependent on coal. However, with the country's new renewable ambitions, the idea that it is better to reduce emissions completely by shifting to renewables strengthened, rather than opting for costly Carbon Capture,"" Bhati added.",376,-0.3094206651051839

Motilal Oswal 's research report on ONGC

Oil and Gas sales and net realization (USD41.4/bbl; -31% YoY) stood in line with estimates. Net sales came in line with est. at INR169b (-31% YoY). We have built in oil/gas production at 23.3mmt/24.8bcm for FY21, as per the management’s earlier guidance. Currently, OPEC+ production cuts stand at 7.7mnbopd (pertaining to Aug’20) and the group is scheduled to meet on 30th Nov’20 and 1st Dec’20 to decide on easing cuts by an additional 2mnbopd from Jan’21. We forecast a crude oil price of ~USD45/bbl for 2HFY21 and expect prices to remain stable around current levels in the medium term. However, we highlight that a change of USD5/bbl in oil price realization would raise ONGC’s EBITDA (consolidated/SA) by 7%/12% for FY22. Despite the delay, ONGC is expected to grow its gas production in FY22, with efforts to arrest the decline in oil production from age-old fields (accounting for 60–70% of total oil production). Maintain Buy.

Outlook

ONGC is trading at 3.3x FY22 EV/EBITDA and 4x FY22 P/E. We value the company at 10x Sep’22E adj. EPS of INR6.4 and add value of investments to arrive at a target price of INR90/share. Reiterate Buy.

HDFC Securities' research report on ONGC

Despite production cuts from OPEC and non-OPEC countries, we expect oil prices to remain at USD 36/41 per barrel in FY21/22E vs. USD 59/bbl in FY20, given the weak global macro. Lower oil and gas realisations will drag profitability down for ONGC. In 2QFY21, revenue was ~4% below our expectations, owing to a lower-than-anticipated crude oil price realisation of USD 41.4/bbl (vs estimate USD 42.7/bbl). EBITDA in 2Q was in line with our estimates. APAT rose by ~55%, courtesy substantially higherthan-anticipated other income, and lower-than-anticipated interest cost.

Outlook

Our REDUCE recommendation on ONGC with a price target of INR 70 is premised on (1) muted crude oil and gas realisations and (2) lack of production growth for oil.

Oil India Ltd signed up for the remaining four blocks awarded under the fifth bid round of Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OLAP).

Speaking at the signing ceremony, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said with the latest bid round, the government has in the last four years awarded 1.56 lakh square kilometre of acreage for finding and producing oil and gas.

This compares to 90,000 sq km of area awarded in nine rounds of New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) and pre-NELP awards in the previous two decades.

He, however, wanted explorers to expedite the hunt for oil and gas so as to make the nation self-reliant in energy. ""You have to exponentially speed up,"" he said.

Red-tape and multiple permissions needed for exploring and producing oil and gas have in the past led to several slippages in the committed timelines.

""Tell us, if you need more help,"" Pradhan said asking explorers to give suggestions on improving the regulatory environment. ""Business as usual cannot work.""

The minister also wanted the data repository set up by his ministry''s upstream nodal agency, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), to be remodelled on lines of the National Geoscience Data Repository (NGDR) of the mines ministry.

He wanted the data repository, which houses geological data of Indian sedimentary basins, to become an independent profit centre.

The NGDR is a public-private initiative for all non-coal and non-fuel resources.

The government had offered 11 blocks for exploration and production of oil and gas in OLAP-V.

A total of 12 bids, including seven bids by ONGC and four by OIL, were received for the 11 blocks on offer at the close of bidding on June 30. Invenire Petrodyne Ltd was the only private bidder for one block.

While ONGC was the sole bidder for six blocks, OIL was the lone bidder in all the four blocks it bid for.

ONGC won all six blocks where it was the sole bidder and also the one block where Invenire Petrodyne had bid.

The previous bid round, OALP-IV, too had seen just eight bids coming in for seven blocks on offer. ONGC had walked away with all the seven oil and gas blocks on offer.

Prior to OALP-V, the government had awarded 94 blocks in four OALP bid rounds since 2017. These 94 blocks cover an exploratory area of about 1,36,790 sq km over 16 Indian sedimentary basins.

In the latest bid round, about 19,800 sq km of the area was offered for bidding, he said.

At the time of the launch of OALP-V, DGH had stated that the round is expected to ""generate immediate exploration work commitment of around USD 400-450 million"".

Of the 94 blocks awarded in the first four rounds of OALP, Vedanta has won the maximum at 51. Oil India Ltd has got 21 blocks and ONGC another 17.

After OALP-V, ONGC''s tally has gone up to 24 and that of OIL to 25.

Under OALP, companies are allowed to carve out areas they want to explore oil and gas in. Companies can put in an expression of interest (EoI) for any area throughout the year, but such interests are accumulated thrice in a year. The areas sought are then put on auction.",577,3.874301910400391e-06

The board of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) will on November 4 consider a share buyback plan as the company management feels the share price is lower than the value it deserves. HPCL, a subsidiary of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), has no immediate history of a share buyback.

In a notice to the stock exchanges, HPCL said its board of directors will meet on November 4 to consider financial results for the second quarter (July-September) and half year (April-September for 2020-21 fiscal. ""The board will also consider a proposal to buyback the fully paid equity shares of the face value of Rs 10 each of the company,"" it said.

The firm did not give details of the proposal. Sources privy to the development said the move is an assertion of management that the company's share price is lower than its value it deserves.

HPCL shares closed at Rs 179.60 on the BSE, up 4.54 per cent from the previous day's close. The rate is about a third of Rs 473.97 per share that ONGC paid in January 2018 to acquire the government's 51.11 per cent share in HPCL.

HPCL is the nation's second-biggest oil retailer. It owns two refineries – a 7.5 million tonnes unit in Mumbai and another 8.3 million tonnes facility at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. It also owns half of the 11.3 million tonnes Bathinda refinery in Punjab and is a 16.95 per cent owner of the 15 million tonnes a year Mangalore Refinery. It owns and operates 17,171 out of 71,843 petrol pumps in the country and is the second-largest fuel retailer after Indian Oil Corp (IOC).

Sources said the share price of the company is about half of its 52-week high of Rs 327.80 and its market cap of Rs 27,367.85 crore is less than Rs 36,915 crore that ONGC paid for a 51.11 per cent stake in 2018. The firm, they said, controls a fifth of the world's fastest-growing fuel market but its share price isn't reflective of the value. And so the company management decided to go for a share buyback.",361,-0.9999200105667114

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has won seven out of the 11 oil and gas exploration blocks offered for bidding in the latest licensing round, upstream regulator Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) said Thursday. Oil India Ltd (OIL) won the remaining four blocks, it said.

The government had offered 11 blocks for exploration and production of oil and gas in the fifth bid round under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OLAP). A total of 12 bids — seven bids by Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and four by Oil India Ltd (OIL) — were received for the 11 blocks on offer at the close of bidding on June 30.

Invenire Petrodyne Ltd was the only private bidder for one block. While ONGC was the sole bidder for six blocks, OIL was the lone bidder in all the four blocks it bid for.

ONGC won all six blocks where it was the sole bidder and also the one block where Invenire Petrodyne had bid. The previous bid round, OALP-IV, too had seen just eight bids coming in for seven blocks on offer. ONGC had walked away with all the seven oil and gas blocks on offer.

Prior to OALP-V, the government had awarded 94 blocks in four OALP bid rounds in the last two and a half years. These 94 blocks cover an exploratory area of about 1,36,800 square kilometres over 16 Indian sedimentary basins. In the latest bid round, about 19,800 sq km of the area was offered for bidding, according to DGH.

OALP-IV was the first round on revamped terms approved in February 2019. Unlike previous rounds, where blocks were awarded to companies offering a maximum share of oil and gas to the government, blocks in little or unexplored Category-II and III basins are now awarded to companies offering to do maximum exploration programme.

The 11 blocks under OALP-V are spread across eight sedimentary basins and include eight on land blocks (six in Category-I basin and one each in Category II and III basins), two shallow-water blocks (one each in Category-I and II basins) and one ultra-deepwater block (Category-I basin). At the time of the launch of OALP-V, DGH had stated that the round is expected to ""generate immediate exploration work commitment of around USD 400-450 million"".

""An area of 1,36,800 sq km has already been awarded under OALP bid round I, II, III, and IV. These OALP bid round-V blocks would add a further 19,800 sq km. Overall exploration acreage of India would then increase to 2,36,600 sq km,"" it had said at that time. Of the 94 blocks awarded in the first four rounds of OALP, Vedanta has won the maximum at 51.

Sources quoted in the report said the proposal also suggests linking the floor price to the popular benchmark Japan-Korea Marker that is used for LNG tariff in North Asia with a discount.

The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has formed a panel to study the plan and explore other options to make gas production remunerative, the sources said.

This comes amid a drop in gas tariffs, which are only expected to slump further in the coming month, according to CARE Ratings.

At present, prices of natural gas from domestic oilfields are not determined by the demand-supply dynamics. India uses a formula to price domestically produced natural gas, with a bi-annual revision in accordance with the 2014 domestic gas policy.

The domestic gas price fixed at $2.39 per mmBtu for the first half of FY21 ends on September 30. It is likely that prices may be slashed by over 17 percent this time, which would push it below $2/mmBtu for the first time. This slump is expected on account of a drop in global prices due to increased production and lower demand amid coronavirus.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on ONGC

ONGC’s 1QFY21 oil and gas sales were in line with estimates along with net crude oil price realization, thus resulting in in-line revenues. However, lower other expenditure led to an EBITDA beat during the quarter. Offtake of crude oil by refineries from ONGC was not affected. However, there was a reduction in gas production due to less off-take by some customers, which has now been restored to normal levels. Production guidance in FY21 for oil stood at ~22.7mmt and for gas at ~24.9bcm. -OPEC+ managed production cuts well (in line with demand), as various economies globally came out of the lockdowns. Thus, crude oil prices hovered around ~USD45/bbl over the last two months. Starting Aug’20, OPEC+ also eased production cuts by 2mnbopd (to 7.7mnbopd). Global demand is expected to reach ~97% of pre-COVID levels in the next quarter (Oct-Dec’20). We have built in crude oil price forecast of ~USD45/bbl for 2HFY21 and we expect prices to remain stable around current levels in the medium term. ONGC has guided that KG basin will see some delay in production as many vendors have enforced force majeure. Despite domestic gas price ceiling declining, KG basin's production would not be impacted. Despite the delay, ONGC is expected to grow its gas production in FY22E, with efforts to arrest the decline in oil production from age-old fields (accounting for 60-70% of the total oil production). Maintain Buy.



Outlook

ONGC is trading at 3.0x FY22E EV/EBITDA and 3.8x FY22E P/E. We value the company at 10x FY22E adj. EPS of INR7.8 and add value of investments to arrive at a target price of INR105. Reiterate Buy.

HDFC Securities' research report on ONGC

In 1QFY21, revenue was ~8% below our expectations owing to a lower-than-anticipated crude oil price realisation of USD 28.7/bbl (vs est. USD 31.7/bbl). EBITDA was ~15% above our expectations due to lower-than-anticipated operating expenses and employee costs. However, APAT fell by ~36%, courtesy substantially lower-than-anticipated other income.



Outlook

Our REDUCE recommendation on ONGC with a price target of INR 78 is premised on (1) muted crude oil and gas realisations and (2) lack of production growth for oil. Despite production cuts from OPEC and non-OPEC countries, we expect oil prices to remain at USD 36/41 per barrel in FY21/22E vs. USD 63/bbl in FY20, given the weak global macros. Lower oil and gas realisations will drag down profitability for ONGC.

VAP output fell 21%/18% to 0.7mmt with a decline in naphtha volumes. NB/JV gas realization fell 25%/41% qoq to USD2.7/3.2/mmbtu NCV. We raise FY21/22E PAT by 7%/13% on lower opex but offset by output cut and 33% tax for FY21.



Outlook

We however reduce EV/EBITDA multiple to 3.5x from 4x due to higher oil prices now and 4-6% ROE. We cut TP by 5% to Rs100. Maintain Buy with an EW stance in EAP.

The extradition trial of absconding arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, who was booked by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) last month on charges of money laundering, is set to begin on September 11.

He is due to appear at London's Westminster Court next week, The Times of India reported.

The fugitive arms dealer was released on conditional bail following his appearance at the London court on July 15.

The ED had reportedly filed a case against Bhandari late in July, in connection with a Rs 6,744 crore-deal with ONGC. The fugitive arms consultant's company Santech International allegedly received kickbacks of around Rs 22 crore from South Korean major Samsung Engineering (SECL).

The case filed by the ED was based on a first information report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that named former senior manager of SECL – Hong Namkoong, UK-based company FosterWheeler Energy, and unknown officials of ONGC and ONGC Petrol Additions (OPaL) along with Sanjay Bhandari.

This is the second money laundering case against Bhandari, who was also booked by the ED in February 2017 for alleged possession of undisclosed assets abroad, among other charges.

He left the country in 2016 even as a lookout circular had been issued against him following a case under the Official Secrets Act (OSA).

The CBI had also booked Bhandari, unidentified officials of the Indian Air Force (IAF), the defence ministry and Switzerland-based Pilatus Aircraft in the money laundering case pertaining to the purchase of Pilatus aircraft for the IAF in 2009.",261,-0.7390878796577454

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) share price gained over a percent intraday on September 2, aday after the company declared its June quarter earnings.

The company reported standalone profit of Rs 496 crore for the quarter ended June 2020, against a loss of Rs 3,098.3 crore in the previous quarter.

Standalone revenue from operations during the quarter stood at Rs 13,011.3 crore, down by 39.4 percent impacted by very low realised crude oil due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also by the volatile global crude oil markets, the company said in its BSE filing.

""Offtake of crude oil by refineries is not affected, though there has been a reduction in gas production due to less offtake by some customers causing marginal reduction in gas sale, which has been now restored to normal levels with gas demand increasing to pre-COVID-19 levels after relaxations in lockdown and gradual opening of industries and various customers,"" it added.

Bottomline and topline were lower than analysts' expectations. A CNBC-TV18 poll estimated profit at Rs 711 crore on Rs 13,956 crore revenue for the quarter.

Other income fell sharply to Rs 436.82 crore in Q1 FY21 against Rs 1,325.64 crore in Q4FY20.

Prices of natural gas in India are likely to be cut to $1.9-1.94 - the lowest in more than a decade - from October, denting revenues of producers such as ONGC who are already incurring huge losses on gas production. A gas price revision is due from October 1 and going by the changes in the benchmark rate in gas exporting nations, the price is likely to be anywhere between $1.90 to $1.94 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu), sources privy to the development said.

This will be the third straight reduction in rates in one year. Prices were cut by a steep 26 percent to $2.39 per mmBtu in April.

Prices of natural gas, which is used to produce fertiliser and generate electricity and is also converted into CNG for use in automobiles as fuel and cooking gas for households, are set every six months -- on April 1 and October 1 each year.

Sources said the cut in prices would mean a widening of losses for India's top oil and gas producer ONGC.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had posted Rs 4,272 crore loss on gas business in 2017-18, which is likely to widen to over Rs 6,000 crore in the current fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021), they said.

ONGC has seen incurring losses on the 65 million standard cubic meters per day of gas it produces from domestic fields shortly after the government in November 2014 introduced a new gas pricing formula that had ""inherent limitations"" as it was based on pricing hubs of gas surplus countries such as the US, Canada, and Russia.

The current $2.39 per mmBtu rate is the lowest in more than a decade.

Sources said ONGC in a recent communique to the government has stated that the break-even price to produce gas from new discoveries was in the range of $5-9 per mmBtu.

In previous years, loss from the gas segment was getting offset from the gain from the oil business. But with oil business itself coming under severe strain due to a sharp slump in benchmark prices, it has become difficult for the company to meet even the operating expenses, they said.

In May 2010, the government had raised the rate of gas sold to power and fertilizer firms from $1.79 per mmBtu to $4.20.

ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL) got $3.818 per mmBtu price for the gas they produced from fields given to them on nomination basis and after adding 10 percent royalty, the fuel cost $4.20 per mmBtu for consumers.

The Congress-led UPA had approved a new pricing formula for implementation in 2014 that would have raised the rates but the BJP-led government scrapped it and brought a new formula.

The new formula takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (the UK), Alberta (Canada), and Russia with a lag of one-quarter. Prices are set every six months -- on April 1 and October 1 each year.

The rates at the first revision, using the new formula, came to $5.05 but in the subsequent six-monthly reviews kept falling till they touched $2.48 for April 2017 to September 2017 period. Subsequently, they rose to $3.69 in April 2019 to September 2019 before being cut by 12.5 percent in October 2019 to $3.23.",565,-0.9453677364758083

State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has trimmed its debt by more than one-third but faces an uphill task meeting proposed investment during the current fiscal due to oil and gas prices falling below sub-optimal levels, according to company officials and regulatory filings.

The Maharatna firm had reduced its outstanding debt to Rs 13,949 crore as on March 31, 2020, from Rs 21,593 crore as on March 31, 2019, as it used revenue from better operations to retire some of the borrowings, according to the company's regulatory filings.

Of the total debt, long-term borrowings account for Rs 2,245 crore which are due for maturity in December 2029.

The firm's cash and cash equivalent (including other bank balances) rose to Rs 968 crore as on March 31, 2020, up from a record low of Rs 504 crore a year back.

Standalone debt-equity ratio at the end of March 31, 2020, is only 0.07 which is considered comfortable.

Company officials explained that ONGC has been working on bringing operational efficiencies and financial discipline and used surplus revenues to repay debt.

""While we ended the 2019-20 fiscal year with a comfortable financial position, we face an uphill challenge during the current 2020-21 financial year. The pandemic has played havoc on oil prices and government-mandated gas price is way below the cost of production,"" a senior official said.

ONGC has planned a capex of over Rs 26,000 crore and meeting that with current oil and gas price will be a challenge, he said.

Another official said the company had taken an impairment loss of Rs 4,899 crore in Q4 FY'20 to factor into estimated future crude oil and natural gas prices.

However, the company believes that oil and gas prices will recover in future, and in that case, this impairment loss shall be reversed as and when prices rise.

ONGC once was India's most profitable company with a cash balance of over Rs 10,000 crore. But the fortunes reversed after the company bought the government's 51.11 percent stake in oil marketing company Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and the Gujarat government's GSPC in a KG basin gas block.

It funded the Rs 36,915 crore acquisition of 51.11 percent equity shares in HPCL through internal funds of Rs 12,034 crore and balance Rs 24,881 crore from borrowed money from commercial banks. The funding requirement of Rs 7,560 crore for Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation's KG block acquisition was met by way of borrowing against term deposits.

Its cash and balances dipped to touch a record low of Rs 504 crore in March 2019, down from Rs 1,013 crore in March 2018 and Rs 9,511 crore in March 2017 and Rs 9,957 in March 2016.

""We live in an era of sub-optimal oil prices and government-mandated natural gas prices that are way below the cost. The answer to such a scenario is to optimise cost and bring in operational efficiencies,"" an official said.

The Petroleum Ministry on July 6 said oil PSUs such as IOC and ONGC are implementing about Rs 3.57 lakh crore worth of projects across the entire hydrocarbon value chain that will further enhance energy accessibility, create jobs and boost the economy.

In Twitter posts, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas said out of Rs 3.57 lakh crore being spent on 859 projects, over Rs 60,000 crore will be invested during fiscal 2020-21.

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and other senior officials of the ministry ""reviewed the ongoing oil and gas projects started by PSUs since the resumption of economic activities from April 20, 2020"".

""As on 1st July 2020 work on 859 projects worth about Rs 3,57,000 crore involving in refinery, exploration and production, marketing infrastructure, pipelines, city gas distribution network and in the entire value chain of oil and gas is going on in full swing,"" it said.

The ministry, however, did not give a timeframe for the investment of Rs 3.57 lakh crore.

While state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) is implementing projects to upgrade oil refineries as well as expand pipeline network to take fuel to every nook and corner, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is exploring for oil and gas in desserts to deepsea.

The crude oil that ONGC produces from fields or which IOC imports, is converted into fuel such as petrol, diesel, and LPG at refineries and sold to customers.

""Out of the total anticipated cost of these projects more than Rs 60,000 crore will be spent in FY 2020-21,"" the ministry said.

A total of more than 9.74 crore man-days of employment is expected to be generated from the completion of these projects. Out of this, more than 3.5 crore man-days of employment is expected to be generated in fiscal through March 2021 (FY21) itself.

For the period between April 29 and June 30, employment of more than 48.96 lakh man-days has been generated in the execution of these oil and gas projects, the ministry said adding Rs 1,395 crore has been disbursed to workers as payout during this period.

""These oil & gas projects will further enhance energy accessibility, create new employment opportunities, and give stimulus to economic growth,"" it said. Pradhan ""advised the PSUs to be more 'Vocal for Local' to contribute to #AatmaNirbharBharatAbhiyan & strengthen #MakeInIndia.""

Motilal Oswal 's research report on ONGC

ONGC’s 4QFY20 oil and gas sales were 3%/8% higher than estimate while net realization was 3% lower than estimate. This resulted in marginal beat on revenue. Higher other expenditure and COVID-19 led impairment resulted in a huge loss on the bottom line for the company during the quarter. ONGC did not see any reduction in crude oil demand starting 1st Apr’20. However, gas production saw modest decline of 9% during the lockdown, but has now been restored to normal pre-COVID levels. Global lockdowns on account of COVID-19 led to huge demand destruction, which saw crude oil prices sink to historic lows. With lifting of the lockdowns across the world, demand is again seeing an uptick. On the supply side, production cuts, both intentional (OPEC++) and unintentional (due to poor economies/bankruptcies), appear to be putting upward pressure on oil prices. ONGC is also expected to grow its gas production by ~12%/26% to 27.9bcm/35.2bcm in FY21/FY22E. While no oil production growth is expected, ONGC’s efforts to arrest decline from age-old fields (accounting for 60–70% of the total oil production) is commendable. Maintain Buy.

Outlook

ONGC is trading at 3.3x FY22E EV/EBITDA and 4.3x FY22E P/E. We value the company at 10x FY22E adj. EPS of INR7.8 and add value of investments to arrive at a target price of INR105. Reiterate Buy.

CLSA has reiterated sell call on the stock with a target at Rs 55 per share.

According to CLSA, it is a big Q4 miss with EBIT was 34 percent below the estimate. However, the impairment & large forex losses were partially offset by a tax write-back.

Kotak Institutional Equities, too, has a 'sell' recommendation in the stock with a target price of Rs 60.

""We revise our consolidated EPS estimates to Rs 3.6 in FY2021 and Rs 7 in FY2022 from Rs 0.1 and Rs 7.1, respectively, factoring in higher Dated Brent crude price assumption of $40/bbl in FY2021 from US$35/bbl earlier, revised exchange rate forecasts, lower oil and gas sales volumes and other minor changes,"" said the brokerage.

Kotak retained 'sell' rating on the stock with an unchanged fair value of Rs 60, based on 11 times P/E multiple to FY2022E EPS plus the value of investments and write-off of acquisition cost for Area 1 block in Mozambique.

""Our reverse valuation suggests that the stock is already discounting crude price recovering to nearly US$48/bbl,"" Kotak said.

Brokerage firm Emkay Global has a 'buy' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 105.

""We value listed investments at a 50 percent holding company discount to the current market price. We cut FY21/22E EBITDA by 6 percent each due to lower oil prices and output, but PAT is unchanged as we build in 25.2 percent tax. We value ONGC at 4 times FY22E core EV/EBITDA (against 3 times earlier) and raise target price slightly by 4 percent to Rs 105,"" said the brokerage.

As per Emkay, key risks for the company are adverse oil-gas prices, policy issues, divestment, cost overruns, COVID-19-led delays and exploration failures whereas duty relief and gas pricing reforms are the key triggers.

Shares of ONGC traded 3.35 percent higher at Rs 83.20 on BSE around 12:25 hours.

India's latest oil and gas block bid round attracted only 12 bids for the 11 areas on offer, with 10 of them getting single bids from state-owned ONGC and Oil India Ltd, upstream regulator DGH said. The government had offered 11 blocks for exploration and production of oil and gas in the fifth bid round under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OLAP), bids for which closed on June 30.

According to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), the 11 blocks on offer got a total of 12 bids -- seven bids by Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and four by Oil India Ltd (OIL). Invenire Petrodyne Ltd was the only private bidder.

While ONGC was the sole bidder for six blocks, OIL was the lone bidder in all the four blocks it bid for, DGH said.

The last bid round, OALP-IV, too had seen just eight bids coming in for seven blocks on offer. ONGC had walked away with all the seven oil and gas blocks on offer.

OALP-V, which opened in January, was to initially close on March 18, but the bid deadline was thrice extended -- first to April 15, then to June 10, and finally to June 30, in view of the COVID-19 lockdown in the country.

So far, the government has awarded 94 blocks in four OALP bid rounds in the last two-and-a-half years. These 94 blocks cover an exploratory area of about 1,36,800 square kilometres over 16 Indian sedimentary basins.

In the latest bid round, about 19,800 sq km of area was offered for bidding, according to DGH.

OALP-IV was the first round on revamped terms approved in February 2019.

Unlike previous rounds, where blocks were awarded to companies offering a maximum share of oil and gas to the government, blocks in little or unexplored Category-II and III basins are now awarded to companies offering to do maximum exploration programme.

The 11 blocks under OALP-V are spread across eight sedimentary basins and include eight on land blocks (six in Category-I basin and one each in Category II and III basins), two shallow-water blocks (one each in Category-I and II basins) and one ultra-deepwater block (Category-I basin).

At the time of the launch of OALP-V, DGH had stated that the round is expected to ""generate immediate exploration work commitment of around USD 400-450 million"".

""An area of 1,36,800 sq km has already been awarded under OALP bid round I, II, III, and IV. These OALP bid round-V blocks would add further 19,800 sq km. Overall exploration acreage of India would then increase to 2,36,600 sq km,"" it had said at that time.

Of the 94 blocks awarded in the first four rounds of OALP, Vedanta has won the maximum at 51. Oil India Ltd has got 21 blocks and ONGC another 17.

Under OALP, companies are allowed to carve out areas they want to explore oil and gas in. Companies can put in an expression of interest (EoI) for any area throughout the year, but such interests are accumulated thrice in a year. The areas sought are then put on auction.

All 11 blocks in OALP-V are based on EoIs received during EoI Window-V from May 16, 2019 to November 30, 2019, according to DGH.

The fifth cycle of submitting EoIs closed on November 30, 2019. This was followed by the sixth cycle that began on December 1, 2019, and was to last till March 31, 2020. It was to be followed by the seventh cycle from April 1, 2020, until July 31, 2020.

DGH has merged the sixth and seventh cycle of EoIs.

The EoI cycle for Round VI (ended March 31, 2020) and Round VII (ending July 31, 2020) stand merged, DGH said, adding that the EoIs received between December 1 and July 31 will be clubbed and put on offer as a combined bid round.",653,0.8595101833343506

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

India's top oil and gas producer ONGC and country's biggest electricity generator NTPC have signed a preliminary agreement to set up a joint venture company for renewable energy projects.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and NTPC Ltd ""entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on May 21, 2020 in New Delhi to formalize this arrangement,"" ONGC said in a statement.

The MoU will enable both companies to achieve their respective targets in renewable energy business.

""As per the MoU, NTPC and ONGC will explore and set up renewable power assets including offshore wind, in India and overseas, and explore opportunities in the fields of sustainability, storage, e-mobility and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) compliant projects,"" the statement said.

ONGC has a renewable portfolio of 176 MW comprising of 153 MW wind power and 23 MW of solar plants.

Through this collaboration with NTPC, ONGC envisages significant growth in its presence in the renewable power sector.

ONGC's Energy Strategy 2040 document calls for the company to invest in renewable energy sources with a target to create 5-10 gigawatts portfolio with a focus on offshore wind power.

NTPC, with a 920 MW of installed renewable power capacity in its portfolio with about 2,300 MW of renewable energy projects under construction and aspiring to reach 32 GW by 2032, will benefit from this tie up by expanding its footprint in offshore wind and overseas renewable energy projects as well, the statement added.

India's top oil and gas producer ONGC is likely to see its loss on natural gas sales widen by nearly 50 per cent to Rs 6,000 crore in the current fiscal after the government-mandated rates for the fuel dropped to a decade low. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had posted Rs 4,272 crore loss on gas business in 2017-18, which is likely to widen to over Rs 6,000 crore in the current fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021), sources said citing a company communique to the government.

The accounts for 2019-20 are yet to be finalised but the loss on gas business should be around Rs 4,500 crore.

ONGC has seen incurring losses on the 65 million standard cubic meters per day of gas it produces from domestic fields shortly after the government in November 2014 introduced a new gas pricing formula that had ""inherent limitations"" as it was based on pricing hubs of gas surplus countries such as the US, Canada, and Russia.

Rates according to this formula were revised every six months. Prices effective April 1 have been cut to $2.39 per million British thermal unit - the lowest in more than a decade.

Sources said ONGC in the communique stated that the break-even price of major ongoing/planned projects to produce gas from newer discoveries was in the range of $5-9 per mmBtu.

In previous years, loss from the gas segment was getting offset from the gain from the oil business. But with oil business itself coming under severe strain due to a sharp slump in benchmark prices to a low of $20 per barrel, it has become difficult for the company to meet even the operating expenses, they said.

The company wants gas pricing to be completely freed with a floor rate of $4.2 per mmBtu (equivalent to rate given in the regulated regime), they added.

The price applicable from April 1 is the lowest that ONGC will realise since 2010 when the government had moved towards deregulating gas pricing.

In May 2010, the Cabinet had approved an Oil Ministry proposal to raise the rate of gas sold to power and fertilizer firms from $1.79 per mmBtu to $4.20.

ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL) got $3.818 per mmBtu price for the gas they produced from fields given to them on nomination basis and after adding 10 per cent royalty, the fuel cost $4.20 per mmBtu for consumers.

The Congress-led UPA had approved a new pricing formula for implementation in 2014 that would have raised the rates but the BJP-led government scrapped it and brought a new formula.

The new formula takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (the UK), Alberta (Canada), and Russia with a lag of one-quarter. Prices are set every six months -- on April 1 and October 1 each year.

The rates at the first revision, using the new formula, came to $5.05 but in the subsequent six-monthly reviews kept falling till they touched $2.48 for April 2017 to September 2017 period. Subsequently, they rose to $3.69 in April 2019 to September 2019 before being cut by 12.5 per cent in October 2019 to $3.23.

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on March 20, 2017, had stated that the cost of production of natural gas in the prolific Krishna Godavari basin is between $4.99 -7.30 per mmBtu.

State-owned ONGC has asked the government to waive payment of oil cess and royalty as plummeting international oil prices have meant that the rate it now gets does not even cover the operating cost, sources said.

While the slump in international oil prices to more than two-decade low is good news for fuel consumers, it is spelling economic havoc on oil and gas producers.

Sources said Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) management has told the government its average price realisation of $22 per barrel in April is not enough to cover even the operating cost.

On top of it, the drop in natural gas prices to a decade low of $2.39 per million British thermal unit is leading to a loss of about Rs 6,000 crore annually.

ONGC, sources said, has asked the government to abolish oil development cess if price realised by producers is less than $45 per barrel. It also wants royalty that the central government charges on oil and gas produced from the offshore area to be waived.

The company has so far maintained a capex of Rs 30,000-34,000 crore in the last few years but the current prices do not generate enough surplus to cover even operating expenditure or opex.

Currently, the government levies 20 percent ad-valorem oil industry development (OID) cess on the price that producers get. Also, ONGC/OIL are required to pay 20 percent royalty on the price of crude oil it extracts from on land oil blocks to the state governments. The central government charges 10-12.5 percent royalty on oil produced from offshore areas.

Sources said the company wants the royalty charged by the central government to be waived for now.

It also wants the formula of pricing domestically produced natural gas at rates prevalent in gas-surplus nations such as the US and Russia. The rates using the formula came to $2.39 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) from April.

This price is the lowest that the company will realise since 2010 when the government had moved towards deregulating gas pricing.

In May 2010, the Cabinet had approved an Oil Ministry's proposal to raise the rate of gas sold to power and fertiliser firms from $1.79 per mmBtu to $4.20.

Sources said OID cess, which has increased from $3 to $13 over the years, is causing a lot of stress on current and new oil and gas projects.

OID cess is levied on crude oil produced as excise duty under the Oil Industries (Development) Act of 1974. The cess is being levied on crude oil from nominated blocks and pre-NELP exploratory blocks only.

The OID cess was raised from Rs 2,500 per tonne to Rs 4,500 per tonne in March 2012. The price of the Indian basket of crude oil stood at around $110 per barrel then.

With the fall in global crude oil prices in mid-2014, companies were asked for reducing the levy and converting it into 8-10 percent ad-valorem. The government had changed the levy of the cess to 20 percent ad-valorem in March 2016.

Sources said ONGC has communicated to the government that the current rate of taxes is threatening to push the firm into cash losses and will impact its planned capex.

Unless profits are made, future investments are at a risk, they said, adding ONGC fields are old and past their prime and it would be a ""big, big mistake"" to believe they would behave as they did a decade back without investments in pulling up recovery rates.

Sources said cutting the cess rate will make over 200 million barrel of oil equivalent of production viable at the entire industry level.

Miles away from land, working as well as living on iron structures standing in 70 to 100 metres of sea depth was always considered a physically demanding and potentially dangerous job. And when the 14-day work shift gets extended to as much as 35 days, it certainly can be mentally stressful and physically exhausting. But not for the 4,500 ONGC employees and officers who have been operating India's biggest oil and gas fields in the Arabian Sea as well as fields and installations in the Bay of Bengal to feed the country's energy needs.

The employees, including 9 women, are happy to continue working on offshore installations as a nationwide lockdown restricts bringing in their replacement.

""I have been receiving messages from these brave employees saying they are happy to continue working on offshore fields as long as it is needed,"" Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker told PTI here.

Most of India's oil and gas is produced from fields lying below the seabed.

To produce oil and gas, firms such as ONGC drill wells and also build installations in the sea to process the oil and gas coming from these wells before it is piped to onshore facilities. The processing platforms have living quarters that house personnel operating and maintaining the fields.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

ONGC has a number of fields in the Arabian Sea, the prime being Mumbai High oil and gas fields, Bassein and Heera. It also has some fields in Krishna Godavari basin in the Bay of Bengal.

Globally, a 50:50 pattern of work in offshore fields is followed. ONGC employees are supposed to work 14 days offshore before getting an equal period of break at their homes.

Shanker said most of the ONGC employees and contractual workers went to work on offshore last month on a 14-day work cycle. But the imposition of the lockdown meant that their replacement could not reach Mumbai -- the base from where they are to be ferried in helicopters to the offshore cite.

""My chest swells with pride to see these young ONGCians who are ready to go the extra mile during these testing times the nation is facing. It moves me to see how each one of them is wanting to do his or her best to serve the nation,"" he said. ""Some people call them 'oil warriors' but I think a more appropriate term would be 'oil sevaks'.""

While mobile phones are not allowed on the installations, the employees stay in touch with their families over satellite phones and video calls.

The living quarters on offshore locations are well-staffed with kitchen, laundry and entertainment rooms but staying at sea for such a long period with no physical contact with land can be mentally exhausting.

Shanker says ONGC has continued to maintain oil and gas production even during the lockdown as a net oil importing nation cannot afford to shut even a single well.

Besides, ONGC fields are old and if some wells are shut down, they will be difficult to revive as the natural pressure that pushes oil and gas out will be hindered.

""Due to COVID-19 lockdown, may of these men and women working offshore have completed 28 days to 35 days duty compared to usual 14-day shift duty and are continuing to perform a duty,"" he said. ""Due to dedicated efforts of offshore personnel, oil and gas production has been maintained from offshore and drilling operations are also continuing.""

A rig operates on 12-hour shifts and typically workers do 14 days and then rotate out for a break for another 14 days.

The machinery on oil rigs is some of the most demanding equipment that works in one of the most difficult environments in the world, with oil and gas being extremely inflammable. An offshore oil rig is a noisy, grimy, cramped existence.

A typical oil rig might rise several stories from the ocean, with living quarters on the sixth or seventh level. Inside, the quarters look like a cross between an office building and a hotel -- except there are no windows. The structure is designed to withstand hurricanes.

ONGC has maintained the oil production rate of 480,000 barrels per day and gas output of 53-54 million standard cubic metres per day.

In a bid to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 25 that shut factories, stopped trains and flights and restricted movement of people and goods. The lockdown was on Tuesday extended till May 3.

""Even during the lockdown, supply chain management by shore base personnel has been very good for ensuring smooth supply of material, fuels, and provisioning to offshore to take care of operations as well as health and safety issues of personnel,"" the ONGC chairman said.

Social distancing, sanitization and other guidelines issued by the government are being strictly followed even in offshore installations, he said, adding around 300 persons were sent back from offshore at the beginning of lockdown period to ensure safety and social distancing.

He said all medical attention is being provided to personnel offshore as well as those onshore.

""We have contacted hospitals to carry out tests to rule out any COVID-19 case,"" he said.

State-owned ONGC has been forced to cut natural gas production by over 15 per cent as factories shut down following the unprecedented nationwide lockdown have refused to take supplies.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which produced 64.3 million standard cubic meters of gas per day (mmscmd) prior to the lockdown imposed on March 25, has reduced the flow to 53.4 mmscmd, sources aware of the development said.

Gas sales are down to 40 mmscmd against 50 mmscmd previously, they said.

The difference between production and sales is due to the fact that some of the gas is also used by ONGC for internal consumption purposes such as power generation and re-injection into wells.

Sources said the company received requests from customers for a reduction in gas supplies while some supply reduction requests have been lodged with the gas transporter GAIL.

The customers refusing gas supplies are mostly small companies whose business has been completely shut because of the lockdown, and city gas distributors who have seen volumes vanish after CNG vehicles went off the road.

In the most far-reaching measure undertaken by any government to check the spread of coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced a three-week-long nationwide lockdown, with effect from March 25.

The lockdown meant offices and factories, barring those involved in essential supplies business, were to be shut and people were to stay at home.

There are indications that restrictions on the movement of people and goods are likely to continue after April 14 when the lockdown ends.

So far, 9,152 persons are reported to have infected with the virus and as many as 308 killed.

The national capital and some states had imposed lockdown and placed restriction on movement of people even before the nationwide lockdown was declared. This had impacted fuel consumption and demand.

A separate source said GAIL, the nation's biggest gas transportation and marketing company, had seen volumes drop to 76 mmscmd from about 115-120 mmscmd prior to the lockdown.

""There is about 30 per cent hit in the gas that is being transported through GAIL pipelines,"" he said.

While factories across sectors have been shut down following the lockdowns, the ones seeking stoppage or reduction in gas intake are mostly in the Gujarat region.

Gas is used as a fuel in a variety of industries - from glass to fertilizer plants. Large factories such as fertilizer plants continue to use gas as they have been classified as essential commodities.

The demand for gas has also been hit as all vehicles, barring the ones used by law enforcement agencies and those used in maintaining essential supplies, have gone off the road. This meant vehicles run on compressed natural gas (CNG) too have gone off the road in cities ranging from Delhi to Mumbai to Ahmedabad.

Lesser CNG vehicles meant lesser need of gas and so city gas distributors too have sought a reduction in the volumes they used to take from GAIL/ONGC, the sources said.

India's top oil and gas producer ONGC has sent an SOS to the government seeking a cut in taxes as well as being granted pricing and marketing freedom for gas to help it weather the slump in prices that has made sustaining operations difficult and may force a cut in investments. The slump in international oil prices to low-20s (USD/barrel) and natural gas prices falling to a decade low of USD 2.39 per million British thermal unit is threatening to push the company into making cash-losses on a monthly basis, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.

While the gas price is way below the cost of production, high tax incidence is resulting in cash losses even on crude oil output.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) last month wrote to the government seeking abolition of oil cess if price realised by producers is less than USD 45 per barrel. Also, it wants the 20 percent of price paid as royalty to state governments be halved.

Currently, the government levies 20 percent ad-valorem cess on the price that producers get. Also, ONGC/OIL are required to pay 20 percent royalty on the price of crude oil it extracts from onland oil blocks to the state governments.

Sources said ONGC wants the formula of pricing domestically produced natural gas at rates prevalent in gas-surplus nations such as US and Russia. The rates using the formula came to USD 2.39 per million British thermal unit from April.

This price is the lowest that the company will realise since 2010 when the government had moved towards deregulating gas pricing.

In May 2010, the Cabinet had approved an Oil Ministry proposal to raise the rate of gas sold to power and fertilizer firms from USD 1.79 per mmBtu to USD 4.20.

ONGC and OIL got USD 3.818 per mmBtu price for the gas they produced from fields given to them on nomination basis and after adding 10 percent royalty, the fuel cost USD 4.20 per mmBtu for consumers.

The Congress-led UPA had approved a new pricing formula for implementation in 2014 that would have raised the rates but the BJP-led government scrapped it and brought a new formula.

The BJP-led government had in October 2014 adopted a formula that takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (UK), Alberta (Canada) and Russia with a lag of one-quarter. Prices are set every six months -- on April 1 and October 1 each year.

Sources said OID cess, which has increased from USD 3 to USD 13 over the years, is causing a lot of stress on current and new oil and gas projects.

OID Cess is levied on crude oil produced as excise duty under the Oil Industries (Development) Act of 1974. The cess is being levied on crude oil from nominated blocks and pre-NELP exploratory blocks only.

The OID cess was raised from Rs 2,500 per tonne to Rs 4,500 per tonne in March 2012. The price of the Indian basket of crude oil stood at around USD 110 per barrel then.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will lose about Rs 4,000 crore in revenue and start making cash losses after the government slashed the natural gas prices by a steep 26 percent by benchmarking it against rates prevalent in gas-surplus nations. Prices of natural gas, which is used to produce fertilizer, generate electricity and gets converted into CNG for use in automobiles and piped natural gas for household cooking, was from April 1 cut to $2.39 per million British thermal unit - a rate about 37 percent lower than the cost of production.

""These rates are unsustainable for us. We have already told the government that the gas pricing should be freed. There should be complete pricing and marketing freedom,"" ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker told PTI here.

The BJP-led government had in October 2014 evolved a new pricing formula using rates prevalent in gas surplus nations like the US, Canada, and Russia to determine the price in a net importing country. Prices using this formula are calculated semi-annually.

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on March 20, 2017, had stated that the cost of production of natural gas in the prolific Krishna Godavari basin is between $4.99 -7.30 per mmBtu. The same for other basins is in the range of $3.80 -6.59 per mmBtu, he had said.

For ONGC, which produces most of its 64 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from western offshore, the breakeven is around $3.8.

""The rates are now way below cost,"" Shanker said.

For every $1 dollar change, the company's revenues are impacted by Rs 4,400-4,500 crore annually.

On April 1, the gas price was reduced from $3.23 per mmBtu to $2.39 - an 84 cent reduction which translates into annual Rs 4,000 crore of revenue loss.

Another company official explained that gas makes up for roughly half of the company's bottomline and if the business makes losses, the company may soon start generating cash losses.

The reduction on April 1 was the second in six months and took rates to the lowest since the new pricing formula came into being in 2014.

The price of gas produced from difficult fields such as deepsea too has been cut to $5.61 from $8.43 per mmBtu. This would just about breakeven ONGC's new production from KG Basin.

The government had in October 2014 adopted a formula that takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (UK), Alberta (Canada) and Russia with a lag of one-quarter. Prices are set every six months -- on April 1 and October 1 each year.

This formula was adopted soon after the expiry of the $4.2 per mmBtu rate fixed for Reliance's KG-D6 gas for five years.

The rates at the first revision, using the new formula, came to $5.05 but in the subsequent six-monthly reviews kept falling till they touched $2.48 for April 2017 to September 2017 period. Subsequently, they rose to $3.69 in April 2019 to September 2019 before being cut by 12.5 percent in October 2019 to $3.23.

Sources said the government realised that the pricing arrived at using the formula was way too low to make the production of gas from difficult fields such as deepsea viable.

So the government in April 2016, gave a ceiling for the gas from such fields. The ceiling in April 2016 was $6.61 which rose to $9.32 in April 2019 before being cut to $8.43 in October and now to $5.61. But this applies only for future gas production and existing deepsea finds get the lower $2.39 price.

India's oil production fell 6.4 per cent in February as a decline in output from fields operated by private firms negated a rise in production from ONGC fields. Crude oil production at 2.39 million tonnes in February was 6.41 per cent lower than 2.56 million tonnes output in the same month a year back, according to official data released by the oil ministry here.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) reported a 4.64 per cent rise in production at 1.67 million tonnes as output from its offshore fields saw a pick-up.

However, fields operated by the private sector firms reported a 32.6 per cent drop with those in Rajasthan seeing a sharp 32.3 per cent lower production.

Rajasthan fields operated by Vedanta Ltd was lower because of ""shutdown from February 5 to 29, for major plant maintenance activities,"" the ministry said.

Crude oil production by Oil India Ltd (OIL) in February was 13.13 per cent lower at 240,260 tonnes.

Natural gas production dipped almost 9 per cent to 2.2 billion cubic meters as ONGC logged over 4 per cent lower output on the back of a drop in output from eastern offshore fields.

The ministry said ONGC's lower gas output was due to ""less gas production from Vasistha/S1 wells in eastern offshore due to sand incursion issues.""

Also, output was less than planned from Bassein field and Daman Tapti block.

India's nearly two dozen refineries produced 7.38 per cent more petroleum products at 21.82 million tonnes on the back of higher output from Reliance Industries' twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat.

It also downgraded the ratings of the unsecured bonds issued by ONGC and those issued by its subsidiary ONGC Videsh Ltd.

The outlook on all ratings remains negative, it said.

""Given the increasingly uncertain oil price environment, ONGC's depleted cash reserves, and government guidelines that constrains state-owned enterprises' ability to lower dividends, ONGC's ratings are materially challenged at the previous rating level and its credit profile insufficient to remain above India's Baa2 sovereign rating. The rating outlook is negative in line with the outlook on India's sovereign rating,"" said Vikas Halan, senior vice-president, Moody's.

""Further, the downgrade reflects our expectation that ONGC's credit metrics will weaken beyond the tolerance level for its ratings, if oil prices remain low for a prolonged period,"" he said.

Against the backdrop of a significant deterioration in oil prices over the last month that is predicted to persist for most of 2020, ONGC decided to pay an interim dividend of Rs 5 per share last week, resulting in cash outflows of Rs 6,300 crore, which has reduced its cash reserves.

ONGC had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of Rs 6,700 crore as on September 30, 2019.

""ONGC's dividend policy is based on the guidelines issued by the Government of India in May 2016, which requires all government-owned companies to pay a minimum annual dividend equal to 5 per cent of their net worth even if they do not have sufficient profits,"" Moody's said.

Despite depleted cash reserves, ONGC is expected to meet its debt repayment obligations given its access to capital as a state-owned company. ""However, its lower cash reserves have diminished the company's capacity to protect its credit profile from oil price shocks,"" Halan said.

ONGC's cash reserves, which provided protection against the oil price decline in 2016, have been depleting over the past three years because of high dividends, share buyback in 2019, and its acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) in 2018.

Its cash and cash equivalents declined to Rs 6,700 crore at September 30, 2019, from Rs 24,700 crore on March 31, 2016. Over the same period, ONGC's net borrowings increased to about Rs 1 lakh crore from Rs 21,500 crore.

In Moody's base case scenario, the effects from the virus will persist into the second quarter of 2020, with improving economic fundamentals in the second half of the year. Under this scenario, Moody's expects oil prices to average USD 40-45 per barrel in 2020, returning to USD 50-55 per barrel in 2021.

However, in a downside scenario, where economic weakness persists longer, oil would average USD 30-35 per barrel in 2020 and USD 35-40 in 2021.

""Moody's expects ONGC's (retained cash flow) RCF/net debt to decline below 30 per cent under its base case scenario and below 20 per cent under its downside case scenario, assuming there are no changes to the company's cost structure, shareholder returns or investment plans,"" the rating agency said.

The rapid and widening spread of the coronavirus outbreak, deteriorating global economic outlook, falling oil prices, and asset price declines are creating a severe and extensive credit shock across many sectors, regions and markets. The combined credit effects of these developments are unprecedented.

Oil and gas has been one of the sectors most significantly affected by the shock given its sensitivity to demand and oil prices.

More specifically, the weaknesses in ONGC's credit profile have left it vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment in these unprecedented operating conditions, and ONGC remains vulnerable to the outbreak continuing to spread and oil prices remaining weak, Moody's said.",652,-0.6325332472721735

State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation said its investments have not been affected due to slowdown in the country's economy.

Speaking to reporters here, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker said the investment of the company are long-term and take time to yield profits.

""Our investments are long-term and it takes long for them to yield profits but our fundamentals are very strong both in oil and natural gas and we are progressing well,"" he said.

ONGC has always been a profit making compay with government stake of 62 per cent and it has made large-scale foreign investments in Middle East, different countries of Africa and even in Venezuela.

Asked whether the current economic slowdown has affected its investments, he said, ""Economic situation has not impacted our investment. We have had Rs 1.5 lakh crore capital investment in last five years with nearly Rs 30,000 crore additional investment every year.

Speaking on the the company's share price fall, he said it might have happened due to adverse environment for companies dealing with fossil fuels.

""A recent study showed that oil and gas company shares are at 10 year low across all companies. In 2019-20, some international companies suffered loss,"" the CMD said.

Macquarie | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 210 per share

The research house lower its FY20 EPS estimate by 4% on weak Q3, while largely maintaining the FY21-22 EPS estimates at Rs 29-27.

Macquarie sees deep value in the company but says it lacks catalyst in the near term and prefers GAIL & HPCL in the Indian oil & gas space.

CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Cut to Rs 180 from Rs 225 per share

Lower production, weak gas price and higher depletion drove 14-20% cut in FY20- 22 EPS.

The broking house reiterates “buy” as the company is the cheapest E&P stock in the world. It trades at compelling core FY21 PE of 3.6x & offers 7.7% dividend yield, it says.

The government’s indication on reduced ETF use may provide relief on share supply overhang and expect stock to more than double in three years.

Nomura | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 175 per share

The Q3 is a miss driven by lower oil sales/realisation & higher opex.

It expects gas production/sales volumes to increase hereon and gas price realisations to likely decline moderately further in Q4.

Nomura expects a sharper reduction in gas realisations from Q1FY21, while continued stake sale by the government is a key overhang.

Jefferies | Rating: Buy | Target: Cut to Rs 155 from Rs 160 per share

The research house cut FY20 EPS estimate by 6% to factor in softer Q3. The softer lower oil prices in Q4 will lead to inventory losses at HPCL & MRPL.

The lower Brent is the key risk and any reform to gas price framework and lower ETF equity supply are catalysts.

In her second budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had on Saturday laid down plans for expansion of national natural gas pipeline network to 27,000 km from the present 16,200 km and pricing reforms as the government looks at boosting the use of environment-friendly fuel.

The government has set a target of raising the share of natural gas in primary energy basket to 15% by 2030 from current 6.2%. Connecting gas sources to consumption hubs is key to achieving this.

Presently, most of the gas pipelines are concentrated in the western and northern part of the country with a few lines in the east and south.

""To deepen gas markets in India, further reforms will be undertaken to facilitate transparent price discovery and ease of transactions,"" she had said.

Presently, the price of natural gas produced domestically is fixed by a formula that averages out rates in gas surplus nations such as Russia and the US.

Edited excerpts:

What are your expectations from the upcoming Budget?

There have been a number of infusions by the government to kickstart the economy in the past 6 months which has in a way tampered with the proposed fiscal deficit target of 3.3 percent of the GDP.

With so many injections already from their end, it is unlikely the Budget will bring about any other “earth-shattering” reforms.

However, there are expectations of some relief on the personal tax front and due to extended monsoons, subsidies for farmers could be another area that could be looked at.

Do you think the govt. will be able to meet this fiscal deficit target?

It is unlikely that the Government would be able to meet its fiscal deficit target this time. There are expectations that the fiscal slip would be as high as 3.7-4 percent.

This is however because of the fact that they have already taken a revenue hit by announcing the corporate tax cuts in October and are still struggling to meet their monthly GST revenue collection above Rs. 1 Lakh Cr.

Which are the sectors that are likely to hog the limelight in this Budget 2020 and why?

Agriculture, real-estate, fertilizers, infrastructure are a few sectors that are likely to be in focus this Budget. These labor-intensive sectors need attention in order to kick-start the economic engine and hence they would hog the limelight this Budget.

What are the expectations from Budget 2020 from investors or market perspective?

The market has most likely had already factored in many of the expectations. However, if there are any significant surprises in terms of taxes, subsidies or further infusions, then the market will definitely show a knee-jerk reaction.

Do you think infrastructure could turn out to be a strong beneficiary in the upcoming Budget?

State-owned ONGC has received bids for 50 out of the 64 small and marginal oil and gas fields it has offered in a first of its kind bid round for raising production by involving private companies.

As many as 12 companies made 28 bids for 50 fields at the close of bidding on January 17, sources privy to the development said.

ONGC had clubbed the 64 fields into 17 onshore contract areas that have a cumulative 300 million tonne of oil and oil equivalent natural gas reserves.

The sources said 28 bids were received for 14 clusters, covering 50 fields, and no bids were received for 3 clusters covering 14 fields.

Duganta Oil and Gas Pvt Ltd made four bids, while Orissa Stevedores Ltd, Priserve Infrastructure Pvt Ltd and Udayan Oil Solutions Pvt Ltd made three bids each.

ONGC wants partners who can raise output beyond a pre-agreed baseline and will share revenues from such incremental production with them.

The sources said salient features of the ONGC offering include complete marketing and pricing freedom to sell oil and gas on arm's length basis through competitive system.

The contractor will be selected on a revenue sharing basis. The revenue will be shared on incremental production over and above the baseline production under Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario, they said.

Contract period will be for 15 years with an option to extend by 5 years.

ONGC invited bids under the production enhancement contract (PEC) from the interested companies, who can bring in technology for raising the output.

The government has been unhappy with ONGC over its stagnant oil and gas production, and inducting partners in small and marginal fields was a way of raising output that was agreed to in a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2018.

ONGC had previously experimented with PEC contracts for two fields but has not been able to select a partner because of receiving conditional bids.

The latest PEC tender is on more liberal terms.

There will be a reduction of 10 per cent in the royalty rate for additional production of natural gas over and above BAU scenario.

Brent Crude oil prices have risen by about 10 percent since December and are expected to surpass crucial hurdles around $70/bbl tracking geopolitical concerns.

Crude Oil prices witnessed a steep rise on news of the assassination of a top Iranian general by the US in an airstrike at Baghdad airport which triggered risk-off sentiment in markets and pushed oil prices on the upside.

Experts are of the view that crude oil prices are likely to remain at elevated levels in the next few weeks and we could see Brent Crude surpassing $70/bbl in the short term that would result in high inflation in oil-importing countries like India.

“After easing of tension between the US and China, and output cuts undertaken by OPEC and its allies, crude oil prices were already rallying,” CARE Ratings said in a report.

“Now coupled with the US airstrike, price of Brent has the potential to increase and cross the $70/bbl mark in the coming few days, depending on the retaliation planned by the Iran government and the longevity of the feud is continued by both the countries,” it said.

Any increase in the price of crude oil is always going to be a cause of concern for India considering it imports more than 80 percent of oil requirements.

According to the CARE Rating report, in the current financial year, India has imported 4.5 mb/d (April-November) of crude oil and the import dependency based on consumption which has increased to 84.5 percent compared with it being 83.3 percent a year ago in the same period.

Jateen Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst (Commodity & Currency) at LKP Securities said that the recent tensions between the US and Iraq escalating strongly due to US airstrike killed key Iranian and Iraqi military personnel, raising concerns that escalating Middle East tensions may disrupt oil supplies.

Trivedi is of the view that Brent Crude can rally over $70/bbl and domestic MCX can touch 4,700 in this cross border tension.

Increase in crude oil is likely to impact current account deficit as well as the fiscal deficit, inflation trends, and could possibly increase the production cost of companies that use crude oil as raw material cost.

“OMCs (oil marketing companies), tyre and paint stocks will be impacted most with higher crude prices and may see correction,” Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor told Moneycontrol.

We spoke to various experts and collated a list of stocks that are likely to get impacted the most from a rise in crude oil:

Expert: Rajesh Palviya, Technical and Derivative Research Head, Axis Securities

Oil Exploration companies like ONGC, OIL India would benefit from any rise in crude prices. Other sectors that use crude oil as a raw material would have a negative impact on this surge in crude prices namely automobiles, OMCs, paints, plastics and packaging material.

Stocks that are likely to get impacted the most include Maruti Suzuki India, Bajaj Auto, HPCL, IOC, and Asian Paints.

Expert: Amit Gupta, Co-Founder, TradingBells.

ONGC, OIL India and oil exploration companies might get benefit from a rise in Crude oil prices whereas IT and Pharma companies may outperform if rupee sees further weakness.

Generally, OMCs, paints, aviation and financial stocks remain under pressure due to a surge in crude oil prices.

Expert: Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities.

ONGC and Oil India are likely to benefit the most from a rise in crude prices. Higher crude prices will entail higher price realizations for these players.

Geopolitical concerns are short-term triggers that cause corrections in the market but the broader trend will remain intact, Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities, tells Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand in an interview.

Q. The Nifty came within striking distance of hitting fresh record highs but geopolitical concerns capped the upside. Do you think we could hit fresh record highs in the coming week, or will these tensions derail the rally?

A. Geopolitical concerns will certainly not derail the bull market rally, rather any kneejerk reaction would be a buying opportunity for investors.

Geopolitical concerns are short-term triggers that cause corrections in the market but the broader trend will remain intact. The Indian bull market will take its own sweet time correcting. In general, 2020 will be far better than in 2019.

Q. What important levels should one watch out for in the coming week?

A. The 12,130 level should be a strong support to watch out for in the coming week. A good amount of profit booking can emerge if markets cross this level on the downside.

Q. Crude oil prices jumped in the week's last trading session. Which stocks are likely to benefit or be impacted the most from this rise?

A. ONGC and Oil India are likely to benefit the most from a rise in crude prices. Higher crude prices will entail higher price realisations for these players.

Q. Any important events which one should watch out for in the coming week?

A. There will not be any material movement in bond yields, currency and exchange rates before Budget 2020 in February. However, the signing of phase one deal between the United States and China would be a key event for the markets to watch out for in January.

Q. What are your expectations from Budget 2020 from an investor point of view?

A. The government will bring out carrots for the secondary market so that they are able to execute their disinvestment targets. This is a certainty that will at least keep the investor community happy.

What then actually comes out in Budget 2020 is anybody’s guess. Since the gross domestic product (GDP) rose by a mere 4.5 percent in the third quarter and consumer confidence is at its lowest, the government will likely try everything in its capacity to revive the economy.

ONGC signed contracts for the seven blocks at an event where Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and other ministry officials were also present.

""These 7 blocks are adding exploration acreage of 18,510 square kilometres spread over three sedimentary basins of India and have a resource potential of approximately 33 billion barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas,"" he said.

The latest licensing round for allowing companies to explore for oil and natural gas was held on revamped terms but saw only ONGC and Oil India Ltd participating in it. ONGC put in bids for all the seven blocks on offer, while OIL put in an offer for one block at the close of bidding on October 31, 2019.

ONGC was the sole bidder in five blocks in Madhya Pradesh and one in West Bengal and it was locked in competition with OIL in one block in Rajasthan. ONGC walked away with all the seven blocks on superior bids.

According to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), seven onland blocks were on offer in the fourth round of Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) with an area of about 18,510 sq km.

""With the culmination of Bid Round-IV today (Thursday), we have awarded 94 blocks under the exploration policy in a very short time span of two and a half years. These 94 blocks cover an exploratory area of approximately 1,36,800 sq km over 16 Indian sedimentary basins,"" Pradhan said. ""Investors of the 94 blocks have committed 29,270 line kilometers of 2D seismic survey and 43,272 sq km of 3D seismic survey, 369 numbers of exploratory wells, 290 core analysis to establish shale resources. This will generate investment to the tune of USD 2.35 billion (about Rs 16,450 crore) over the next 3/4 years in the exploratory activities alone.""

In the first three rounds of OALP, about 1,18,000 sq km area was awarded, he said adding that the area awarded for exploration compares with about 90,000 sq km of area under exploration prior to OALP.

The fourth round of bidding under OALP had the lowest number of blocks. While the first round got 110 bids for 55 blocks, the second round attracted 33 bids for 14 blocks. The third round saw 42 bids for 23 blocks. In the previous three rounds together, 87 blocks have been awarded covering an area of 1.18 lakh sq km.

OALP-IV was the first round on revamped terms approved in February 2019.

Unlike previous rounds where blocks were awarded to companies offering a maximum share of oil and gas to the government, blocks in little or unexplored category-II and III basins are now awarded to companies offering to do maximum exploration programme.

While blocks in Madhya Pradesh fall in the Vindhyan basin which is a category-II basin, the Bengal Purnea basin is category-III area where no exploration has happened so far.

Pradhan said the OALP-IV will open two new basins for exploration in the country.

Under OALP, companies are allowed to carve out areas they want to explore oil and gas in. Companies can put in an expression of interest for any area throughout the year but such interests are accumulated thrice in a year. The areas sought are then put on auction.

The fifth cycle of submitting EoIs closed on November 30, 2019, and was followed by the sixth cycle that began on December 1, 2019, and will last till March 31, 2020.

As much as 20,000 sq km of the area has been sought in the fifth cycle which will be put for bidding before March, Pradhan said.",636,0.6584252715110779

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has begun an exercise to shed excess cost at the Mumbai offshore oil and gas fields of Panna-Mukta whose control it regained after two and half decades and has already saved Rs 1 crore in the shipping cost.

ONGC has changed the contract for bringing oil produced from the fields lying in the Arabian Sea to land, resulting in saving of about USD 5,000 per day, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.

It is expecting an upside in production too after a re-appraisal.

Sources said the previous operators, Shell India and Reliance, had engaged a floating storage and transportation vessel from Mercator Ltd for shipping oil.

Soon after taking over the field last month, ONGC changed the shipper to state-owned Shipping Corporation Ltd, resulting in saving of about USD 5,000 per day, they said adding the saving totals to Rs 1 crore-plus.

Sources said the company will lay a small undersea pipeline soon to completely do away with the requirement of hiring ships for transporting oil to land.

ONGC had originally discovered the Panna-Mukta and Tapti (PMT) oil and gas fields in the Arabian Sea off the Mumbai coast in the early 1990s. These were however taken away from the company and in 1994 awarded to a consortium of US energy giant Enron and Reliance Industries Ltd. ONGC as a government nominee was given 40 per cent back-in rights.

Enron during its bankruptcy was taken over by BG Group of UK in 2003. BG Group's interest was subsequently taken over by Shell in 2016.

The 25-year production sharing contracts for the PMT fields expire this week and Reliance and Shell had decided not to seek an extension for Panna-Mukta fields, resulting in them being reverted to ONGC on December 21, 2019.

Reliance and Shell-owned BG Exploration and Production India Ltd (BGEPIL) held 30 per cent stake each in PMT.

The Tapti fields had ceased production earlier in 2016 and the Tapti process platform facilities were handed over to ONGC (Government of India nominee) in 2016.

Sources said ONGC sees an upside in oil and gas production from the Panna-Mukta field which it will firm up after doing a reappraisal of the reserves.

The fields produce about 10,000 barrels of oil per day and 4 million standard cubic meters per day of natural gas.

The production sharing contracts (PSC) for the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields, which were executed by the PMT JV with the Government of India in 1994, expired on December 21, 2019.

Decommissioning and site restoration of residual Tapti facilities, including five unmanned platforms and in-field pipelines, are being carried out by the PMT JV under India's first offshore decommissioning and site restoration project.

The Panna-Mukta fields, off the Mumbai coast, have produced 211 million barrels of oil and 1.25 trillion cubic feet of natural gas since December 1994. In 2019, the average monthly production from the fields was around 10,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 140 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day.",518,0.999972383181254

State-run ONGC has received environment clearance (EC) for carrying out onshore exploration, development and production of oil and gas in 100 locations in non-forest area of Assam, that would entail an investment of Rs 3,500 crore, according to official documents. The Union Environment Ministry has given green clearance to ONGC, the country's largest oil and gas exploration and production company, after taking into account the recommendations of a green panel.

""The EC is however subject to obtaining prior permission from the wildlife angle, including clearance from the Standing Committee of the National Board of Wildlife,"" the ministry said in a letter to ONGC.

The company proposes to carry out drilling in 100 locations to evaluate the hydrocarbon potential of 21 different onshore Petroleum Mining Lease (PML) blocks in a non-forest area covering 944.39 km in Assam and Assam Arakan Basin covering whole of the Upper Assam North in Sivasagar district.

After establishing the potential, the company will put the field under development and production. The project cost is estimated to be Rs 3,500 crore, the company added.

According to ONGC, there is still a lot of scope in exploring new sub-surface structures in Assam for hydrocarbons.

The total area of Sivasagar district PML is 957.73 square kilometre, in which Lakwa, Rudrasagar, Geleki and its adjoining areas are important oil producing fields in North Assam Shelf of Sivasagar district.

So far, more than 500 wells (including exploratory wells and development wells) have been drilled in this field with depths ranging from 2,400 metre to 4,200 metre.

The current EC has been granted for exploratory drilling of 100 wells which is a part of ongoing exploration efforts in various PML areas falling within the three main blocks of North Assam Shelf in Sivasagar district.

India is dependent on imports for crude oil, and the government is encouraging exploration and production of oil and gas.

ONGC produces 70 per cent of the country's crude oil and 60 per cent of its natural gas.",340,

After operating Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields for 25 years, Royal Dutch Shell and Reliance Industries will revert the western offshore fields back to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), the companies said in a statement.

Panna-Mukta and Tapti (PMT) oil and gas fields in the Arabian Sea off the Mumbai coast were in 1994 awarded a consortium of US energy giant Enron and Reliance. ONGC, which had originally discovered the fields, as a government nominee given 40 per cent back-in rights.

Enron during its bankruptcy was taken over by BG Group of UK in 2003. BG Group's interest was subsequently taken over by Shell in 2016.

The 25-year production sharing contracts for the PMT fields expires this week and Reliance and Shell had decided not to seek an extension for Panna-Mukta fields.

""After 25 years of operating the Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, the Panna-Mukta and Tapti Joint Venture partners will be handing over the Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields back to the Government of India's (GOI) nominee i.e. ONGC on December 21, 2019,"" a joint statement issued by Reliance and Shell said.

Reliance and BG Exploration and Production India Ltd (BGEPIL) hold 30 per cent stake each in PMT while the balance 40 per cent is with ONGC.

""The production sharing contracts (PSC) for the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields, which were executed by the PMT JV with the Government of India in 1994, will expire on December 21, 2019,"" it said.

Decommissioning and site restoration of residual Tapti facilities, including five unmanned platforms and in-field pipelines, are currently being carried out by the PMT JV under India's first offshore decommissioning and site restoration project.

The Tapti decommissioning and other commercial activities would continue in BGEPIL even after Panna-Mukta handover, as per the statement.

The Panna-Mukta fields, off the Mumbai coast, produced 211 million barrels of oil and 1.25 Trillion cubic feet of natural gas since December 1994. In 2019, the average monthly production from the fields was around 10,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 140 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day.

Speaking on the development, Trivikram Arun, Managing Director, BGEPIL said, ""The PMT JV is a great example of a successful partnership between India's largest national oil company (ONGC), India's largest private company (Reliance) and an international oil company (Shell).""

""Our teams have worked relentlessly to ensure a safe handover of the producing fields from the PMT JV to ONGC at the end of the term,"" he said.

B Ganguly, President-E&P, Reliance said, ""At their peak, Panna-Mukta have contributed to nearly 6 per cent of India's oil production and almost 7 per cent of India's gas production in the year 2007-08. Reliance has been a part of this journey and contributed, by providing energy, to the growth and development of India's oil and gas sector.""

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's cash and bank balances tanked to Rs 504 crore in March 2019 – according to a report in The Indian Express.

In March 2018, cash and bank balances stood at Rs 1,013 crore while a year earlier it was Rs 9,511 crore.

The freefall in the upstream petroleum major's cash reserves is particularly concerning as it is India's largest oil explorer – accounting for 60 percent of the country’s crude oil production.

While the slide is precipitated by two deals involving ONGC's stake buys in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd and GSPC, the government has maintained that the company has ""sufficient lines of credit from banks and strong access to capital markets"" to maintain its working capital requirements.

However, comparative six years data shows ONGC's oil exploration spend steadily decreased by half from Rs 11,687 crore in March 2014 to Rs 6,016 crore in March 2019. The corollary is a steady decrease in domestic crude production, which slipped to 35.68 MMT in FY18 from 38.09 MMT in FY12, it noted.

Additionally, since ONGC lists its exploration and production business as the “predominant cash-generator”, the slip is viewed as negative.

A silver lining here is the company’s developmental wells spend, which kept pace over the past six years, up to Rs 9,362 crore in FY19 from Rs 8,518 crore in FY14.",234,-0.3333139816919963

Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday said it has assigned a 'Baa1' rating to the proposed senior unsecured notes to be issued by Oil and Natural Gas Corp under its USD 2 billion medium-term note program. The outlook on the rating is negative, Moody's said in a statement.

""The notes' rating is in line with ONGC's Baa1 issuer rating, which is in turn primarily driven by its standalone credit profile as captured by the company's baa1 Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA),"" says Vikas Halan, a Moody's Senior Vice President.

The rating reflects ONGC's position as the largest integrated oil and gas company in India with significant reserves, production and crude distillation capacity as also its substantial operating cash flow generation capacity.

It also factors the firm's solid credit metrics that have improved but remain constrained by volatile — although range-bound — oil prices and high shareholder returns.

At the same time, Moody's expected that ONGC will not be asked to share fuel subsidies, as long as oil prices stay below USD 70 per barrel.

""ONGC's issuer rating also incorporates the company's high likelihood of extraordinary support from and very high dependence on the Government of India, in times of need. However, this assumption of government support has not resulted in any rating uplift, as the sovereign's rating is below ONGC's BCA,"" it said.

Given ONGC's strong credit metrics and status as a government-owned company, it enjoys strong access to debt capital markets and has substantial financial flexibility through equity stakes in Indian Oil Corp and GAIL India, which together were valued at about Rs 21,000 crore as on November 14, 2019.

Moody's ratings for ONGC are based on the full consolidation of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) which includes the full consolidation of HPCL's 49 per cent-owned joint venture, HPCL-Mittal Energy.

The government owns 62.98 per cent of ONGC's equity and has the ability to appoint all of its board of directors.

""The negative outlook on ONGC is in line with the negative outlook on the Government of India's rating and reflects Moody's view that ONGC's ratings will be downgraded if India's sovereign rating is downgraded to Baa3 from Baa2,"" Moody's said.

""Given the negative outlook, an upgrade is unlikely. The outlook will return to stable if the outlook on the sovereign rating moves to stable.""

ONGC's ratings may experience downward pressure if the sovereign rating is downgraded, ONGC increases its pace of acquisitions such that it results in higher business risk and a deterioration in its credit metrics, or oil prices decline on a sustained basis resulting in weak cash flow generation and a deterioration in ONGC's credit metrics, it added.",450,0.00261668860912323

The memorandum of understanding (MoU), signed late Monday, will be later signed as a definitive deal after Exxon studies the blocks of the company, one of the sources told Reuters.

Lately, India is generating a lot of interest worldwide in its oil and gas operations, as growing demand amid a global slowdown and government policies have made investments and returns attractive.

Amid reports of ONGC's inability to derive any benefit out of its HPCL acquisition, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday said the state-owned firm was free to sell its stake in the oil refining and marketing company.

In its most expensive acquisition ever, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) last year paid Rs 36,915 crore to buy government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL).

Despite being the majority stakeholder in the company, ONGC has only got one member on the board and virtually no say in the management.

HPCL didnt even recognise ONGC as its promoter for almost one-and-half-years before a Securities and Exchange Board of India rap forced it to list its majority owner as a promoter.

Since acquiring the stake, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board.

HPCL head Mukesh K Surana continues with the title of Chairman and Managing Director despite corporate governance structure mandate of only one chairman in a group and subsidiaries being headed by managing directors or chief executive officers (CEOs).

When asked if the government had given ONGC nod to sell stake in HPCL, Pradhan told reporters that ""These are market decisions. They are autonomous companies. They are free to take their own decision at appropriate time.""

ONGC had hoped that the addition of an oil refining and marketing company would make it a vertically integrated oil and gas company when it had acquired government stake in HPCL in January last year.

However, no tangible synergies have flowed to the company. The acquisition turned ONGC from a zero-debt company to a firm with no cash and a huge debt pile.

Sources said, since the government had repealed the acts that nationalised HPCL and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), ONGC is now free to sell the stake.

The board of ONGC has on at least one occasion debated on the logic of retaining the stake in HPCL when no synergies were flowing, they said.

HPCL by virtue of being 51.11 per cent owned by a state-owned firm had continued to be classified as a public sector undertaking. But with the act that promised its nationalised PSU character no longer there, it can be sold in parts or full to a strategic investor, they said.

The government had in 2016 repealed the legislations that had nationalised HPCL and BPCL. The Repealing and Amending Act of 2016 had annulled ""187 obsolete and redundant laws lying unnecessarily on the statue-book"" including the Act of 1970s that had nationalised HPCL and BPCL.

HPCL was incorporated in 1974 after the takeover and merger of erstwhile Esso Standard and Lube India through the Esso (Acquisition of Undertaking in India) Act passed by Parliament.

The Supreme Court had in September 2003 ruled that BPCL and HPCL can be privatised only after Parliament amends a law it had previously passed to nationalise the two firms.

Besides others, the 2016 legislation approved by the Parliament listed repealing in ""the whole"" The Esso (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1974, The Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertakings Act, 1976 and The Caltex [Acquisition of Shares of Caltex Oil The whole] Refining (India) Ltd and of the Undertakings in India of Caltex (India) Ltd] Act, 1977.

The Supreme Court had in September 2003 cited the Esso (Acquisition of Undertaking in India) Act and the Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertaking in India) Act, 1976 and Caltex (Acquisition of Shares of Caltex Oil Refining India Ltd and all the Undertakings in India for Caltex India Ltd) Act, 1977 to rule that the government cannot privatise HPCL and BPCL without approaching Parliament for changing the Nationalisation Act.",619,-0.9356542229652405

On September 30, the government announced a 12.5 percent reduction in domestic natural gas price to $3.23 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) from $3.69 per mmBtu (on a gross calorific value basis).

This is the first reduction in gas price in India since April 2017.

""The price decrease is credit negative for Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) because its revenue and earnings from the gas business will fall by around Rs 1,460 crore.

""The decline is equal to 0.3 percent of the company's expected consolidated revenue and around 2 percent of consolidated EBITDA for fiscal 2020, which ends on March 31, 2020,"" Moody's said in a note.

The decline in natural gas revenue and earnings will have a limited effect on ONGC's metrics for fiscal 2020 because its gas business is small compared with its total upstream business, it said.

""For the year ended March 2019, ONGC derived only about 17 percent of its revenue (excluding downstream operations) from gas, with most of its revenue coming from the sale of crude oil (73 percent),"" Moody's said.

The reduced price is applicable for October 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020.

Prices are calculated using a formula implemented in November 2014 and domestic natural gas prices are revised every six months.

Gas prices in India are determined by taking a volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (UK), Alberta (Canada) and Russia.

ONGC is India's largest integrated oil and gas company, accounting for 75 percent of crude oil and natural gas production by volume, and 17 percent of domestic refining capacity.

The company recorded consolidated oil and gas production of 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.

As of June 30, 2019, ONGC was 64.25 percent owned by the government of India, ""which has a significant influence on the company's financial policies and strategy,"" Moody's added.

Separately, rating agency Icra said the gas price revision is marginally positive for urea sector as the pooled price for the fertiliser sector is expected to moderate by $0.19 per mmBtu.

""This should result in lowering of the cost of production and subsidy receivables for the urea players,"" Icra said.

Natural gas is a key raw material for manufacturing of urea and comprises nearly 70 percent of the total cost of urea production. For the fertiliser sector, nearly 42 percent of the gas requirement is met through domestic gas, while the remaining is met through R-LNG imports.

The industry is supplied gas at pooled pricing, which takes into account the weighted average of domestic and R-LNG prices.

K Ravichandran, Senior Vice-President & Group Head, Corporate Ratings, Icra said, ""As per our estimates, the cost of production of urea changes by around Rs 1,600-1,800 per ton for every $1 per mmBtu change in the pooled gas price. As a result of the current revision in the domestic gas price, the subsidy outgo for the government would reduce by Rs 400 crore in H2 FY2020.""

With the share of domestic gas falling in overall consumption mix for fertiliser sector, the impact of the change in domestic gas price has also been diminishing, he said, adding that nearly 58 percent of natural gas demand in the fertiliser sector is being met through long term R-LNG, wherein the prices are governed by crude oil prices.",599,-0.27562331408262253

The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has said in a tweet that there was no gas leakage at its Uran plant in Navi Mumbai.

The state-owned company was reacting to multiple reports that there was a gas leak at the facility and that surrounding areas had been evacuated.

Smell of hydrocarbon was felt on September 25 morning that was spread due to incessant rains, the company said, asking people not to panic.

The company added that all precautionary measures were in place and that the plant was running normally.

ONGC tweeted: “At ONGC Uran plant smell of hydrocarbon felt early Morning which was spread due to incessant rains. There is no leakage. All precautionary measures in place. Plant is running normal. There is nothing to panic. (sic)”

In another tweet, ONGC said that senior officers were present at the Uran plant. “Interaction with local villagers and administration is on to dispel the panic caused by hydrocarbon smell in the vicinity, which is spread due to heavy rains.”

The board's order was issued considering violation of environmental laws in six wells of the state-owned energy behemoth in Assam.

""Pollution Control Board, Assam, is constrained to inform you that you have nonchalantly violated the provisions of law in force causing pollution to the environment

""Environmental compensation fine amounting to Rs 2,04,90,000 only has been assessed as per formula provided by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), Principal Bench,"" said the order dated September 5, 2019.

ONGC has been asked to deposit the money within one month of issuance of the order.

When contacted, ONGC officials declined to make comments immediately.

Before taking the action, the Pollution Control Board, Assam (PCBA) had issued a show cause notice to the company on June 28 this year and ONGC replied to it on July 18.

""Your reply to the show cause notice is not based on the facts and findings of the inspection carried out during July 6 to July 8, 2019 by engineers and scientists deputed from Head Office cum Central Laboratory of this board,"" the order said.

It also said that the drilling operation of the six well units were ""either completed or in operation without installing any primary effluent treatment plant"" (PETP) at the sites.

""During inspection by the officials of the board's Regional Laboratory cum Office, at Sivasagar, it has been observed that there is seepage/leakage in the waste pits of the wells. Waste pits were full of effluent and without having any treatment facility,"" PCBA said.

It also mentioned that the Supreme Court, in its judgment passed on February 22, 2017, had directed all the effluent discharging units to install PETP within three months, which was by May 22, 2017.

""Thereby you have violated the aforementioned order of the Supreme Court of India pertaining to installation of primary effluent treatment plant,"" the board told ONGC.

As per the ""analysis report"" of samples collected during the inspection by the officials, it was found that parameters such as ""oil and grease and total suspended solids"" are beyond the permissible limits in all cases, which indicate ""your failure in pollution control measures"", the order said.

Though the penalty was for six wells, but the board informed ONGC that the Regional Laboratory cum Office had reported there was no mobile ETP for treatment of the effluent of the waste pits in eight wells.

The Brent crude rallied 19 percent at $72/bbl in intraday trade on September 16 following the drone attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities over the weekend.

Goldman Sachs said an outage of more than six weeks due to the drone strikes could cause Brent prices to rally above $75 a barrel, though the magnitude of the impact was uncertain at this point.

Any further rise in crude prices may have an impact on the fiscal deficit of India amid fall in rupee against the US dollar. High crude will impact input costs for many industries, impacting earnings and margins.

Industry reports suggest that every $10 a barrel rise in crude prices expands India’s current account deficit (CAD) by 0.4 percent of the GDP. And, every 10 percent increase in crude prices can push up the inflation rate by 20 basis points.

Along with oil marketing companies (OMCs), fertiliser, gas downstream, petrochemicals and paints companies may see pressure on margins. However, it spells cheer for producers like Oil India, ONGC and HOEC by way of better realisations.

“Media reports indicate 2.0-2.3m b/d of output would be restored by 16-Sep’19 but restoring the entire output would take weeks. We believe there is enough crude inventory and spare capacity to supply markets if entire production is restored within a few weeks,” ICICI Securities said in a report.

“Oil price movement would depend on when production is fully restored and whether there are any further attacks. If oil prices surge further it may be positive for ONGC/GAIL but may hurt the investor sentiment in OMCs.”

Assuming 2m b/d of output restarts on September 16 and the balance after 30 days, there will be a shortfall of 3.7m b/d for 30 days, implying a shortage of 111m bbls.

If 111m bbls were to be drawn from inventory, it would reduce Saudi and OECD strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) and commercial crude inventory of 2,367m bbls by just 4.7%, the report said.

The US President has authorised a release from SPR of 630m bbls, if needed (amount to be decided later). OPEC and its non-OPEC allies may increase output from part of their 3.7m b/d spare capacity to make up for the shortfall, if required.

GAIL, ONGC may gain if oil price remains high

ICICI Securities is of the view that high prices for a few months will boost ONGC’s oil and petroleum product realisation and GAIL’s LPG realisation and gas marketing profit.

GAIL makes a high profit on marketing US LNG if Brent is over US$60/bbl. Only risk for ONGC maybe if it has to bear subsidy.

Crude spike negative for downstream companies

The spike crude prices, even though temporary, will be negative for downstream OMCs such as BPCL, HPCL, and IOCL, and Castrol, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note.

The brokerage firm does not rule out moderation in marketing margins on auto fuels—a US$10/bbl rise in global crude and product prices may require OMCs to increase the retail price of diesel and gasoline by Rs5-6/litre in the following fortnight.

“Sharp jump in global crude prices may also put pressure on refining margins amid slowing demand, besides increasing the absolute quantum of fuel and loss. On the other hand, higher crude prices may be construed positively for upstream PSUs and GAIL,” it said.

Despite being a fair distance away from record-high levels, Nifty's slow but steady rise toward 12,000 is good news for the Indian markets especially as more than 50 percent of the stocks in the index are available at attractive valuations.

About 23 companies, or nearly 50%, of the Nifty50 universe is trading at a discount to their 10-year P/E multiple, data from Motilal Oswal and AceEquity showed. These include Tata Steel, ONGC, Coal India, NTPC, JSW Steel, IOC, Gail India, Axis Bank, Power Grid, among others.

Even though the valuations appear mouthwatering, the questions remains– should you buy around these levels or one should stay put or avoid getting into these stocks altogether?

Investors must note that even though these stock appear attractive based on numbers, the fundamentals may present a different story. Most experts we spoke to opined that investors should tread cautiously when it comes to these stocks.

A Price-to-Earnings ratio or PE value the company is a ratio of current market price to its earnings per share. It also referred to as multiple. This measure of valuing the company is used by investors to filter out stocks for investment.

The golden rule of investment is to pour money in stocks that are trading at attractive levels compared to their intrinsic value, thus allowing investors to create wealth over a period of time.

“We would advise not to go by only the price decline from average price as average can shift further below. Key is to look at what are the business ecosystem that can drift the positives turn profitable for the company and how it reflects on share price,” Pritam Deuskar, Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“Today, it looks like as if the pharma sector has bottomed out but when it will start working nobody knows. The kind of infra spending, smart cities, airports, and construction budget till 2030 will come out, for sure some of these companies will benefit,” he said.

Well, markets are built on hope and everything gets priced well in advance. Fundamentally speaking, individual stock fundamentals and business developments matter more than just the price of the stock. Should investors bottom fish in some of these names?

“One has to carry out stock-specific analysis while bottom fishing stocks which are trading at a discount to their historical averages,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“Many of these stocks are cyclical, like Tata Steel, JSW Steel, ONGC and Coal India. These stocks are driven by their commodity-related specifics. Sustainable growth plays an important role while ascertaining a stock’s fundamentals. Sun Pharma and Zee have been in the news for corporate governance reasons, one of them might be out of the woods,” he said.

How relevant are long term averages?

Long term moving averages define the price action of a security. It is a good tool to use while analyzing market movements as valuations are key while analyzing indexes, suggest experts.

The golden rule is that if the index is trading at a significant premium above the moving average then it might be a good time to sell, and vice-versa. But, it should be used with other parameters such as price to book value, as well as moving averages.

“Buying stocks that are trading at deep discounts to long term moving average works better when this happens in cyclical industries. Moving averages like 200 DMA & 30 DMA acts as a general indicator of long term and short term trends,” Romesh Tiwari, Head of Research, CapitalAim told Moneycontrol.

“It must be used with other parameters like PE ratio and Price to book value to make long term buying and selling decisions in quality stocks,” he said.

ONGC Petro additions Ltd (OPaL), majority-owned by ONGC, is primarily a polymer manufacturer, a chemical compound used in everything from textiles to plastics and packaging.

""We are looking at various options. Our first preference is to convert OPaL into a subsidiary by converting share warrants and debenture into equity if we don't get a strategic partner,"" Subhash Kumar, ONGC's director of finance told Reuters. ""Another option is to merge OPaL with ONGC.""

ONGC will decide by the end of its fiscal year on whether to make OPaL a subsidiary, he said.

""After making it a subsidiary, it will take another two years to list the company,"" Kumar said.

ONGC has long tried to bring in a strategic partner in the petrochemical project but failed to strike a deal so far.

Reuters reported last year that Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), world's no. 4 petrochemical company, had shown interest in buying about half of the project. SABIC's Kuwait Petroleum Corp had also shown interest in buying a stake.

""Prospective partners had set certain terms for participation like selling petchem in their own brand,"" Kumar said, citing reasons talks to sell a stake had not progressed.

He did not name any companies with whom ONGC had held talks.

ONGC's stake in the project could rise to 70% if it converts 26 billion rupees of share warrants into equity and to about 93% if it also converted 77.78 billion rupees of debentures into shareholdings, Kumar said.

ONGC owns 49.36% of the project and gas utility Gail (India) Ltd owns another 49.21%. The remaining stake is held by Gujarat State Petroleum Corp Ltd, a state government-owned gas company, as of March.

Highlights:

- Indian Oil, BPCL are also in the race for assets of the firm, which is divesting its pipeline business

- Govt has been planning to split GAIL by hiving off its gas marketing and pipeline business -------------------------------------------------

Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings have joined the race to buy the gas pipeline assets of state-run GAIL (India), three people aware of the matter said.

A potential deal would be a vital win for Brookfield, which recently bought the gas pipeline assets of Reliance Industries. GAIL owns more than two-thirds of India’s 12,000-km pipeline network.

The company, which is in the process of divesting its pipeline business, has already received interest from state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) for the gas transmission assets.

“Prospective bidders have begun initial discussions with GAIL and are expected to put a formal offer once a formal sale process begins post the demerger,” said the first of the three persons cited above, all of whom requested anonymity.

Brookfield and Temasek declined to comment emails sent on September 6. GAIL too did not reply to an email sent seeking details of the stake sale process.

The government has been planning to split GAIL by hiving off its gas marketing and pipeline business into a separate entity and selling a majority stake in it to strategic investors. The government holds 52.68 percent in GAIL, which had a market capitalisation of Rs 59,195.61 crore as on September 6.

GAIL’s marketing business brought in more than three-fourths of its total revenue in the last fiscal.

GAIL, India’s biggest natural gas marketing and trading firm, is also adding another 9,000 km of pipelines. The company dominates India’s gas marketing landscape with a 59 percent share.

An IOC official said the company sees huge value in GAIL’s transmission assets as it plans to expand its own gas distribution network. IOC, the second-largest gas marketer in India after GAIL, has lined up aggressive expansion plans for city gas distribution.

A BPCL official said GAIL’s transmission network will give a fillip to its plans of expanding in the gas distribution business. Last fiscal, BPCL hived off its gas business into a separate wholly-owned unit so that the company can sharpen its focus by bringing all natural gas-related businesses into one fold.

Spokespersons at IOCL and BPCL did not respond to emails sent on September 6 on whether they plan to bid for GAIL’s pipeline assets.

A second person, an investment banker aware of the talks said, “The RIL-Brookfield pipeline deal has set a precedent for such asset monetisation. GAIL too has been exploring this option. They have held talks with several investors including, Brookfield and Singapore’s Temasek”.

This March, Brookfield’s India Infrastructure Trust, an InvIT, bought RIL’s loss-making entity East-West Pipeline for Rs 13,000 crore. The InvIT took 100 percent stake in Pipeline Infrastructure Pvt that owns and operates the East-West Pipeline.

Though GAIL has argued that its gas marketing and transmission businesses operate at arm’s length and hence splitting them is of little significance, the government, in order to meet part of its Rs 1.05 trillion target for raising revenue from disinvestments this fiscal, is keen on the bifurcation.

To achieve its disinvestment target last fiscal, the government has sold its entire 51.11 percent stake in refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) to state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) for Rs 36,915 crore.

GAIL, which took shape in August 1984 after it was spun off from ONGC’s gas business, has multiple long-term contracts to import gas in its liquid form (LNG) from countries such as the US.

It is currently unclear if the strategic buyers would be given the responsibility of retaining these contracts. One option is to allow GAIL to continue with the marketing business that would include all the sale contracts and the city gas retailing.

Since GAIL has been maintaining separate accounts for its gas pipeline and marketing businesses, analysts said this makes it easier to split them into two entities. GAIL’s networth rose to Rs 39,062 crore last fiscal from Rs 35,142 crore in the previous year.

The state-owned company said there was no impact on oil processing and that the gas was diverted to its Hazira plant near Surat, Gujarat.

The blaze erupted around 7.00 am, the police said.

""Four people have been killed and three others injured in the mishap,"" a senior police official said.

""Fire broke out in storm water drainage in Uran Plant early morning successfully doused within two hours by firefighting team. #ONGCs robust crisis mitigation preparedness helped put off this major fire in a very short time,"" ONGC said in a tweet.

Nearly 22 fire brigade tenders, including that of the ONGC, Navi Mumbai civic body and other agencies, were at the spot, the police official said.

The injured persons were admitted to nearby hospitals for treatment, he said. The cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained, he added.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), has sought yet another two-year extension to explore a Vietnamese oil block in the contested waters of the South China Sea.

Officials said OVL has applied for a sixth extension to explore Block-128, the licence for which was valid till June 15, 2019.

While India wants to maintain its strategic interest in the South China Sea, Vietnam wants an Indian firm to counter China's interventions in the contested waters.

The officials said OVL had in May applied to the Vietnamese authorities for the sixth extension of the exploration licence for the deepsea block and is likely to get it.

""We have a commitment to drill one well on the block and to fulfil that we have sought an extension,"" one of the officials said.

Another official said the company had a couple of years ago drilled a well on the block but it could not reach the target depth and so it now has to drill the well all over again.

""If we don't drill, we are liable to pay penalties,"" he said.

OVL had signed production sharing contract (PSC) for the 7,058 sq km Block 128 in offshore Phu Khanh Basin, Vietnam, on May 24, 2006. The Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), Vietnam, issued an investment licence for the block on June 16, 2006, being effective date of the PSC.

The company has not found any hydrocarbon in the block but is continuing to stay invested to maintain India's strategic interest.

OVL first took a two-year extension of the exploration period till June 2014 and then another one year. A third extension was granted on May 28, 2015, and a fourth in 2016. It got the fifth extension for two years in 2017.

The company has so far invested $50.88 million in the block.

The block lies in the part of the South China Sea over which China claims sovereignty. In 2011, Beijing had warned OVL that its exploration activities off the Vietnam coast were illegal and violated China's sovereignty, but the company continued exploring for oil and gas.

OVL made a foray into Vietnam as early as 1988, when it bagged the exploration licence for Block 6.1.

Last month, China sent its coast guard ships into Block 6.01.

""Their (Chinese) vessel came 5 nautical miles near the oil rig on the block on August 13. They withdrew after a couple of days,"" the official said adding that operations in the block were not affected.

This, he said, was the third instance of Chinese vessel intruding into the block, where Russia's Rosneft is the operator.

OVL owns 45 percent stake in Block 6.01 and its share of production was 2.023 billion cubic metres of gas and 0.036 million tonnes of condensate.

The 955 sq km Block 06.1 located in Nam Con Son basin has two producing fields -- Lan Tay and Lan Rosneft -- and has 35 percent stake while the remaining 20 percent is with PetroVietnam.

The firm had in 2006 got two exploration blocks -- Block 127 and Block 128. While Block 127 was relinquished due to poor perspectives, the other block was retained.

The first extension for Block 128 followed China putting the area under Block 128 for global bidding.

India's top oil and gas producer ONGC on August 30 unveiled a $15-16 billion investment plan to double output from its domestic and overseas fields, expand its refining capacity three folds and diversify into renewables to earn four times higher net profit by 2040.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which has seen crude oil production stagnate as a majority of its prime fields are ageing and are past their prime, has adopted a new 'Energy Strategy 2040', company Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker told reporters here.

The company, which started with an equity infusion of Rs 343 crore by the government more than six decades back, has generated a wealth of over Rs 9 lakh crore since then and is now venturing on a new road to further enhance value.

It has already seen a turnaround in natural gas with output rising for the fourth successive year to 24.75 billion cubic meters and is further slated to go up to 32 bcm by FY24, he said. ""We see gas production rising to 40 bcm by 2040,"" he said.

The new Energy Strategy 2040, which was adopted by the board a few weeks back, sets target of ""three-time revenue distributed across exploration and production (E&P), refining and marketing; 4 times current PAT with 10 per cent contribution from non-oil and gas business; and 5-6 times current market capitalisation,"" he said.

ONGC, he said, will still remain strongly invested in oil and gas but it also looks beyond hydrocarbons.

""The new strategy document aims to transform ONGC in a new 'avatar' in this new energy landscape as a diversified energy company with a strong contribution from non-E&P businesses,"" he said.

The firm produced 24.23 million tonnes of crude oil in the 2018-19 fiscal year and 25.81 billion cubic metres of natural gas from its domestic fields. Another 10.1 million tonnes of oil and 4.736 bcm of gas was produced from its overseas assets.

It had a turnover of Rs 1,09,654 crore and a net profit of Rs 26,715 crore in the year ended March 31, 2019. It has a market capitalisation of Rs 1.55 lakh crore as on date.

""Our fields are old and ageing, 30-50 years old and have reached a plateau. So we are investing in re-development projects to arrest the fall and extend the life,"" he said.

The company is investing around Rs 86,000 crore in 27 major projects to boost oil and gas production, which has stagnated over the last few years.

These projects will yield 76 million tonnes of oil and 121 bcm of gas.

The overall plan, which includes overseas projects, expanding refining capacity and investing in renewables, will entail $15-16 billion investment.

""These numbers will change as we progress with some projects being advanced and finances undergoing changes,"" ONGC Director (Finance) Subhash Kumar said.

Shanker said its investments in new frontiers - primarily to hedge against disruption in existing portfolio, will include carbon capture and storage, artificial intelligence for exploration, hydrogen fuel, lithium mining and biofuels.

Oil and oil equivalent natural gas production is seen rising from 65 million tonnes to 135 million tonnes by 2040, he said.

""The strategic roadmap envisions a future-ready organization whose growth is predicated on a few important planks: consolidation of our core upstream business (domestic and international); expansion into value accreting adjacencies in the oil and gas value chain (downstream and petrochemicals) and diversification into renewables (offshore wind) and select new frontier plays through dedicated venture fund,"" he said.

?It targets cumulative upstream output (local and overseas) almost doubling from current levels with 2 per cent and 5 per cent CAGR in domestic and international operations respectively.

With two 35 million tonnes per annum of oil refining capacity vested in its two subsidiaries -- HPCL andPL, ONGC is targeting to raise this capacity to around 90-100 million tonnes. Also, expansion is petrochemicals will be prioritised.

Besides, ONGC plans to make investments in renewables energy sources with a target to create 5-10 gigawatts portfolio with a focus on offshore wind power, he said.

ONGC has been under pressure to reverse the falling output from its ageing fields, where the natural decline has set in. It is investing heavily to arrest the domestic fall while at the same time aggressively look for assets overseas.

""The strategic roadmap also looks to create long-term optionality through investor play (venture fund corpus of about $1 billion) in select frontier themes such as clean energy, artificial intelligence (AI) or reservoir/field services technology,"" he said.

In upstream oil and gas exploration and production (E&P), priority would be accorded to select difficult plays (high-pressure high temperature, ultra-deepwater) with high-prospectivity and low stretch from current core, development of in-house enhanced oil recovery solutions to maximize legacy production, exploration-focused technology partnerships, dedicated marginal fields unit as well as building decommissioning capabilities.

He said there was significant room for deriving operational synergies between HPCL andPL through integrated crude sourcing, centralised trading, capability and infrastructure sharing.

2019-08-29 16:42:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/ongc-to-borrow-2-billion-through-unique-overseas-debt-programme-4386491.html,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) on August 29 said it plans to raise up to $2 billion in overseas borrowings through a unique and flexible, Singapore-listed debt instrument that provides it with an option to raise funds at short notice.

The funds so raised can be used to repay about Rs 15,000 crore of the company's existing borrowings, fund acquisitions or meet project/asset expenses.

In a press statement, ONGC said it has ""set up a Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme of $2 billion which will be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.""

The EMTN programme would enable ONGC or any of its named subsidiaries to go to market at short notice, say 5 to 10 days, to borrow funds any number of times within a one-year period.

For the current EMTN programme, ONGC, its overseas arm ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) or its subsidiaries can access the market.

As on June 30, ONGC had a borrowing of about Rs 15,000 crore while another Rs 42,000 crore debt was on OVL books.

ONGC, India's top oil and gas producer, is implementing multi-billion dollar projects within the country to bring to production new discoveries or prolong output from existing fields. Its overseas arm is on the prowl for acquisitions besides having funding requirements for the 41 projects it has in 20 countries.

Both companies have accumulated debt on their books because of acquisitions they made in recent times. ONGC exhausted all its cash and became a net debt company last year when it bought government stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,915 crore and Gujarat government firm GSPC's stake in a KG basin field for Rs 7,738 crore.

""An EMTN programme is an uncommitted facility and any drawdown thereof under this document would be subject to funding requirements,"" the statement said. ""This is a landmark achievement for ONGC as it is amongst select few corporates and India's first oil and gas public sector integrated energy major to set up an EMTN programme.""

ONGC chairman and managing director Shashi Shanker said the EMTN programme is a landmark achievement for ONGC as it would further enhance the company's credit profile amongst global investor base.

""We have embedded structural features in the programme which would allow ONGC, ONGC Videsh or its subsidiaries to access international markets within a shorter time frame,"" he said. ""We do believe this programme will assist in meeting our strategic financing requirements for our organic or inorganic growth prospects due to our vision of becoming an integrated energy major of global reckoning.""

A euro medium-term note is a medium-term, flexible debt instrument that is traded and issued outside of the US and Canada. These instruments require fixed payments and are directly issued to the market with maturities that are less than five years.

""Current low yield environment in international debt markets does provide attractive tenor funding options, however any drawdown under the programme will be made to meet specific requirements of ONGC, OVL or its subsidiaries,"" said Subhash Kumar, Director (Finance), ONGC.

The EMTN programme, he said, would allow ONGC to access international bond markets opportunistically to meet its funding requirements.",525,0.999412993590037

Cautious and tepid commentaries by several corporates raise concern for the further earnings downgrades. Thus Q2FY20 is also expected to be muted with a visible slowdown in discretionary spending all over, Yogesh Mehta, founder of Yield Maximisers, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts:

Q: Domestic and global cues point towards a possible recession across the globe which could, in turn, affect India's growth story. What are your views?

A: Fear of slowing US economy is rising day by day and the data also indicates India can’t remain immune for a longer time if the situation of the US and China trade tension intensifies further.

The new monster of inversion of yield curve emerged in the US bonds may see the ripple effect of slowing down in FII investment inflows in India that can be seen as not encouraging for Indian markets.

Q: How did India Inc. fare in the June quarter earnings?

A: Q1FY20 corporate earnings disappointed the street, Nifty PAT grew merely 5 percent YoY, compared to an estimate of 12 percent.

Cautious and tepid commentaries by several corporates raise concern for the further earnings downgrades. Thus Q2FY20 is also expected to be muted with a visible slowdown in discretionary spending all over.

Q: Top five outperformers and underperformers from the Q1 season.

A: Outperformers

UltraTech Cement:

UltraTech Cement reported an all-time high EBIDTA growth led by realisation beat and deleveraging focus.

Asian Paints: With 24 percent EBIDTA growth aided by high double-digit volume growth, this stock stands out as a clear outperformer.

Sun Pharma: EBIDTA growth of 24 percent was largely in-line with US sales. Ilumya is gaining traction and normalise R&D spending from Q2 will support the stock.

Zee Entertainment: The media company reported 47 percent YoY jump in the domestic subscriptions with expansion in margins, which is a positive sign.

Underperformers:

Tata Motors: The global automaker disappointment the Street, weighed down by sharp margin contraction in JLR and India business, and even guidance was revised down to 3-4 percent for FY20.

ONGC: PAT was down due to one-off provision and higher interest cost.

SBI: Higher credit cost and higher slippages.

Tata Steel: Weak margins, weak outlook and capex cut by 25percent. The net profit was down 53 percent.

Q: FIIs have been pulling out money from Indian markets consistently since July while MF absorbed most of that selling. But, do you think the momentum will continue?

A: FIIs sold equities worth Rs 15,000 crores in July. Nifty corrected about 8.5 percent from all-time highs of 12,103.

FII selling momentum may continue if current economic pressures and weak earnings persist.

Q: With global recession looming large, gold is all set to clock Mount 40K on MCX. Do you think it is the right time to invest in gold or gold ETF?

A: The way US-China trade war is getting intensified, due to tumbling bond yields they are no more attractive, hence, gold is catching momentum as safe heaven (asset class). If INR weakens further and international gold price rises further one can still invest in gold.

Q: Auto sector has been under pressure with more firms opting for shutdowns. Do you think this sector could produce wealth creators if someone buys the stocks at current levels with a time frame of 2-3 years?

A: Demand for auto has tapered down and the auto index is back to its 2014 levels which are providing an opportunity for investors but at current levels, it is like a half glass full and half glass empty.

However, with 2-3 year timeframe, staggered investment in the leaders of the sector is recommended but not as a wealth creator.

ONGC Energy Strategy 2040 envisions the company as ""A diversified energy company with a strong contribution from non E&P business; 3x revenues and about 5-6x market capitalisation,"" he said.

The firm produced 24.23 million tonnes of crude oil in the 2018-19 fiscal year and 25.81 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas from its domestic fields. Another 10.1 million tonnes of oil and 4.736 bcm of gas were produced from its overseas assets.

It had a turnover of Rs 109,654 crore and a net profit of Rs 26,715 crore in the year ended March 31, 2019. As on August 16, it had a market capitalisation of Rs 164,458 crore.

In the company's latest annual report, Shanker said the ONGC board recently approved the business roadmap for the company and its other group entities -- 'ONGC Energy Strategy 2040'.

The 'Energy Strategy 2040' entails ONGC achieving ""three times revenue distributed across exploration and production, refining, marketing and other businesses; four times current profit-after-tax (PAT), with 10 percent contribution from non-oil and gas business; and 5-6 times current market capitalization,"" he said.

""The strategic roadmap envisions a future-ready organization whose growth is predicated on a few important planks: consolidation of our core upstream business (domestic and international); expansion into value accreting adjacencies in the oil and gas value chain (downstream and petrochemicals) and diversification into renewables (offshore wind) and select new frontier plays through dedicated venture fund,"" it said.

The document targets cumulative upstream output (local and overseas) almost doubling from current levels with 2 percent and 5 percent CAGR in domestic and international operations respectively.

With two 35 million tonnes per annum of oil refining capacity vested in its two subsidiaries -- HPCL and MRPL, ONGC is targeting to raise this capacity to around 90-100 million tonnes. Also, expansion is petrochemicals will be prioritised.

Besides, ONGC plans to make investments in renewables energy sources with a target to create 5-10 gigawatts portfolio with a focus on offshore wind power.

ONGC has been under pressure to reverse the falling output from its aging fields, where natural decline has set in. It is investing heavily to arrest the domestic fall while at the same time aggressively look for assets overseas.

""The strategic roadmap also looks to create long term optionality through investor play (venture fund corpus of about USD 1 billion) in select frontier themes such as clean energy, artificial intelligence (AI) or reservoir/field services technology,"" it said.

Internationally, focus shifts to plays with volume in host regimes with a positive government-to-government relationship with India to secure stable energy long-term supplies, the annual report said.

ONGC said there was significant room for deriving operational synergies between HPCL and MRPL through integrated crude sourcing, centralised trading, capability and infrastructure sharing.

Addressing ONGC employees on the 73rd Independence Day, he said: ""15 of these projects currently under execution will directly contribute to oil and gas production.""

""The cumulative oil and gas gain from these projects is expected to be over 180 million tonne of oil and oil equivalent gas in their life cycle,"" he said.

The firm produced 24.23 million tonne of crude oil in the 2018-19 fiscal year and 25.81 billion cubic metres of natural gas from its domestic fields. Another 10.1 million tonne of oil and 4.736 bcm of gas was produced from its overseas assets.

ONGC envisages a natural gas output of over 32 bcm by FY24, Shanker said in his which was webcast from company headquarters in Dehradun to 30,000-plus employees across 38 work locations of ONGC, according to a company statement.

The directors of ONGC were also present on the occasion.

Pitching for an transformative approach to the energy business, he talked about the ambitious 'Energy Strategy 2040' that will help ONGC achieve ""three times revenue distributed across exploration and production, refining, marketing, and other businesses; four times current profit-after-tax (PAT), with 10 per cent contribution from non-oil and gas business; and 5-6 times current market capitalisation.""

Speaking on ONGC's business performance, he said that the company earned the highest ever revenue of Rs 1,09,655 crore in 2018-19, an increase of 29 per cent over the previous fiscal. It has also logged a record net profit of Rs 26,716 crore, an increase of 34 per cent.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the firm's overseas investment arm, recorded the highest ever production of 14.83 million tonne of oil and oil equivalent gas during FY19.

In downstream refining, its subsidiary MRPL achieved highest ever throughput of 16.43 million tonne with capacity utilisation of 109.5 per cent.

Newly acquired HPCL (ONGC subsidiary) has also achieved the highest ever sales volume of 38.7 million tonne with a domestic sales growth of 4.7 per cent over historical high, he said.

""The Petroleum & Natural Gas Ministry has announced several enabling policies which, I am sure shall bring in positive changes in India's oil and gas sector,"" he said.

Supporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for a domestic solar revolution, ONGC had launched a nation-wide Solar Chulha Challenge. Shanker said that through this initiative and with the help of IIT-Mumbai, 86 Solar PV cooking stoves were installed at Bacha and Jamthi in Betul district of Madhya Pradesh. The entire village of 74 households has been benefitted at Bacha village.

The 73rd Independence Day was celebrated at all the 38 domestic work centres of ONGC as well as its 40 overseas projects in 21 countries.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) asked HPCL to re-file shareholding pattern to stock exchanges by August 13 for all quarters since Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) acquired government's entire stake in the refiner in January 2018.

""HPCL intends to rectify the shareholding pattern and classification of promoters by the stipulated date as per the direction from SEBI,"" the company said in a stock exchange filing, attaching a copy of the letter it received from the regulator on the subject.

SEBI, in the August 6 letter, asked HPCL to disseminate its letter to the stock exchanges.

ONGC in January last year bought the government's entire 51.11 percent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore but continued to be mentioned under ""public shareholder"" in the filings by the oil marketing company. President of India, in six shareholding pattern filings HPCL made since then, remained as ""promoter"" without any stake in the company.

SEBI in the letter said it had in a letter dated September 10, 2018 ""advised HPCL to re-file the shareholding pattern to the stock exchanges revising the status of ONGC as 'promoter'.""

""Further, as informed by HPCL vide its email dated June 27, 2019, Government of India has also advised HPCL that 'President of India' will continue to be the promoter of HPCL and ONGC to be added as a Promoter below 'President of India. However, HPCL has not abided by the aforesaid direction to revise the status of ONGC as 'promoter' till now,"" the regulator said.

The regulator said its response to the informal guidance request was ""clear and self-explanatory"".

""Hence any further request for clarification on the issue does not arise,"" it said. ""Accordingly, you are once again advised to re-file the shareholding pattern to the stock exchanges for all quarters since the acquisition of shares by ONGC, while revising the status of ONGC as a 'promoter' by August 13, 2019, failing which appropriate action will be initiated as per SEBI Act.""

SEBI asked HPCL to place its letter before the board of directors in its next meeting and disseminate the letter to the stock exchanges.

Replying to the SEBI letter, HPCL on August 7 had sought ""specific clarifications from SEBI pertaining to procedures and approvals related"" to the issue.

HPCL said it has not received ""the necessary clarifications"" from SEBI and ""in order to give effect"" to its August 6 direction, ""we have no choice but to infer that no further approvals whatsoever is required to be obtained by HPCL from any stakeholder/agency in this regard"".

The company said the SEBI's letter was placed before HPCL board on August 7.

HPCL has continuously refused to recognise ONGC as its promoters and hasn't list any specific reason for not doing so.

Sources close to ONGC said IT company Mindtree recognised Larsen and Toubro as its promoter within a day after the engineering giant acquired a majority stake.

Last month, an HPCL spokesperson had stated that the company needed ""clarifications /details"" from ""multiple agencies/ authorities to ensure compliance to various stipulations applicable to listed companies including Companies Act, SEBI Regulations, etc"" before doing so.

""As soon as all the clarifications/details are received from concerned agencies /authorities, necessary amendments as required will be made in the regulatory filings after following due process. Till such time, the status quo is being maintained in the regulatory filings,"" the spokesperson had said.

While HPCL management has been unrelenting, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in written replies to questions in Parliament had listed the company as a subsidiary of ONGC.

The government too has been treating HPCL as ONGC subsidiary and its headhunter Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) on June 17, called ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker to assist in selecting the new Director (Finance) of HPCL.

As of now, HPCL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh K Surana would sit on the PESB interview panels for selecting directors.

While the promoter tag does not bring any specific privileges to ONGC, a lack of the tag, keeps it out of insider trading regulations as it gets full agenda of every board meeting of HPCL and can be aware of price-sensitive information.

According to the SEBI's rules, the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company.

When Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had bought the government's stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd, it was listed as the latter's promoter in every instance after the deal. The same was the case when IOC acquired a majority stake in Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd (CPCL).

Since acquiring a majority stake in HPCL, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board.

Sources said Coal India Ltd's governance structure, which the HPCL management has so often cited to allow Surana retain the Chairman and Managing Director designation, even though there cannot be two Chairmen within a group, clearly provides for the holding company chairman to sit on the panel for selecting directors of subsidiary companies.

Coal India is a holding company and has seven subsidiaries. The board of each of the subsidiaries is headed by a chairman and Coal India too has a chairman and managing director to head the board.

The fair trade regulator had ordered a probe against Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) in June 2018 after prima-facie finding the oil major in violation of competition norms.

The complaint was filed by Indian National Shipowners' Association (INSA), a representative body of various ship owners.

To support its offshore exploration and production activities, ONGC requires offshore support vessels (OSV). In this regard, it issues tenders for OSV suppliers with detailed technical eligibility requirements and special contract conditions (SCC), among others, collectively referred to as CHA.

INSA had complained about the Charter Hire Agreement (CHA) of ONGC which had a particular clause that gave unilateral right to the state-owned firm to terminate the agreement. The said clause was one-sided and abusive in nature, INSA alleged.

By terminating the agreement unilaterally, ONGC violated Section 4 of the Competition Act which pertains to abuse of dominant position in the relevant market, INSA alleged.

For the case, CCI considered ""market for charter hire of OSVs in the Indian EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone)"" as the relevant one and found that ONGC was dominant in it.

The prevailing circumstances also need to be taken into consideration to establish whether the firm abused its dominant position or not, CCI said.

It is an undisputed fact that the crude oil prices started falling drastically from mid-2014, from over $100 per barrel to under $30 per barrel by January 2016, which affected oil companies worldwide, including ONGC, the fair trade regulator said.

With drastic fall in oil prices, ONGC in April 2016 issued de-hiring notice to 27 vessels by invoking the unilateral termination clause.

Regarding invoking of the clause, CCI said that there was an objective necessity to bring down the costs in new market circumstances and the termination was driven solely by this necessity and obligation.

Besides, the clause was invoked by ONGC in an exceptional situation which was not an ordinary change of circumstance, it added.

The clause ""which gives unilateral right of termination without assigning any reasons to ONGC, in itself is not found abusive given the disproportionate risk that ONGC has to bear in case of such termination by the OSV, especially when the Commission has found, in the given facts and circumstances, that the invocation of such clause was not in bad-faith"", CCI said in an order dated August 2.

The regulator further said that had it been found that ONGC invoked the clause frequently in order to make illegitimate gains at the expense of the other contracting party, the Commission may have had the occasion to look at this case differently.

No such situation seems to exist in the present case, it added.

Accordingly, the ""Commission is of the considered view that in the present case the conduct of ONGC does not tantamount to an abuse of dominant position within the meaning of Section 4 of the Act"", CCI said and directed the case to be closed.",514,-0.8547582725683848

Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) has for the last one-and-half-years refused to recognise its majority shareholder ONGC as a promoter, according to stock exchange filings.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) in January last year bought the government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore. Following which, HPCL became ONGC's subsidiary.

HPCL management however, has continuously refused to recognise ONGC as its promoter.

In a regulatory filing HPCL made to stock exchanges on July 21, in the shareholding for the quarter ending June 30, 2019, HPCL again listed ONGC as ""public shareholder"" and not as its promoter.

Just like the previous five quarterly filings, HPCL listed ""President of India"" as its promoter with ""zero"" per cent shareholding. ONGC was listed as ""public shareholder"", owning ""77.88 crores"" shares or ""51.11 per cent"" shareholding of the company.

Sources close to ONGC said, IT company Mindtree recognised Larsen and Toubro as its promoter within a day of the engineering giant acquiring a majority stake, but HPCL has steadfastly refused to acknowledge its new promoter, ONGC.

An email sent to HPCL spokesperson seeking comments remained answered.

While HPCL management has been unrelenting, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in written replies to questions in Parliament had listed the company as a subsidiary of ONGC.

The government too has been treating HPCL as ONGC subsidiary and its headhunter Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) on June 17, called ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker to assist in selecting the new Director (Finance) of HPCL.

Sources said, the chairman of ONGC, as a result of it being the holding company of HPCL, by rule was invited to be on the interview panel to select the director.

Till now, HPCL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh K Surana would sit on the PESB interview panels for selecting directors.

HPCL Director (Finance) J Ramaswamy retired on February 28, and interviews for the post held by PESB on June 17 selected R Kesavan, who currently is an executive director in HPCL, according to a notice put out by the government headhunter.

For selecting the director of a company where the government or its controlled company has more than 50 per cent stake, PESB panel interviews shortlisted candidates. The panel is assisted by the Secretary of the administrative ministry and the chairman of the company concerned.

The Department of Personnel guidelines states that ""in the case of subsidiaries, the full-time Chairman of the holding company is invited to assist the Board.""

Sources said going by these guidelines, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director was invited to sit on the interview panel to select HPCL Director (Finance).

Sources said the government had earlier this year asked HPCL to add ONGC as its co-promoter but the oil refining company sought to delay it by seeking further clarifications.

While the promoter tag does not bring any specific privileges to ONGC, a lack of it keeps it out of insider trading regulations as it gets full agenda of every board meeting of HPCL and can be aware of price-sensitive information.

Moody's Investors Service July 17 affirmed state-owned ONGC's Baa1 local and foreign currency issuer ratings, saying it reflect an improvement in the firm's credit metrics because of rise in oil prices.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC) consolidated credit metrics - as measured by retained cash flow (RCF) to net debt - improved to 51 per cent for the fiscal ended March 31, 2019 (fiscal 2019) as compared to 40 per cent for fiscal 2018. ""The improvement was largely driven by better earnings, which in turn was because of higher realized crude oil prices,"" Moody's said in a statement.

This should result in ONGC generating positive free cash flow - despite the company's high level of capital spending and shareholder returns - which Moody's expects the company will use to reduce its borrowings. Its credit metrics will likely remain appropriate for its rating category over the next 12-18 months.

""The rating affirmation reflects our expectation that ONGC's credit metrics, which have improved over the last 12 months because of the high net realized oil price, will remain appropriate for its ratings,"" said Vikas Halan, a Moody's Senior Vice President. ""Based on an average net realized oil price assumption of USD 65 per barrel, we expect that the company's earnings for fiscal 2020 will be broadly in line with fiscal 2019.""

ONGC's Baa1 issuer ratings are primarily driven by its standalone credit profile, as captured in its baa1 Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA).

The company's BCA reflects in turn its position as the largest integrated oil and gas company in India with significant reserves, production and crude distillation capacity; substantial operating cash flow generation capacity; and credit metrics that have improved but will remain constrained by volatile - although range-bound - oil prices and high shareholder returns, it said.

""At the same time, the BCA incorporates Moody's expectation that the company will not be asked to share fuel subsidies, as long as oil prices stay below USD 70 per barrel,"" Moody's said.

ONGC's rating also incorporates a high likelihood of extraordinary support from and very high dependence on the government.

However, this assumption does not result in any rating uplift, because the sovereign rating is below ONGC's BCA.

ONGC generates sufficient cash flow to fund its capital spending and shareholder returns. However, the company's cash and cash equivalents of Rs 10,20 crore as of March 31, 2019, are insufficient to cover its debt maturing over the next 12 months of Rs 54,500 crore. Of this, about Rs 25,500 crore represents working capital loans and scheduled debt maturities at its subsidiaries - HPCL and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemical Ltd - and are not guaranteed by ONGC.

Of the remaining Rs 29,000 crore, ONGC has already repaid or refinanced about Rs 10,000 crore as of July 15, 2019.

""Given ONGC's strong credit metrics and status as a government-owned company, it maintains strong access to debt funding markets and can refinance its remaining short-term borrowings,"" Moody's said.

Also, the company maintains substantial financial flexibility, as seen by its stakes in Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Gail (India) Ltd (Baa2 stable), which were valued at about Rs 22,600 crore at July 15.

The government owns a 64.25 per cent direct stake in ONGC and appoints all the directors on the company's board.

Moreover, the risk from government influence was evident in January 2018, when the government sold its 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC for Rs 36,900 crore, which resulted in the weakening of ONGC's credit metrics.

""Because of this risk, ONGC's ratings are constrained to no more than one notch above the sovereign's Baa2 rating,"" Moody's said, adding the rating outlook is stable on the expectation that shareholder returns and the company's growth plans will continue to be executed within the tolerance level of its current ratings.

In addition, the stable outlook assumes the company will improve its debt maturity profile, such that its cash and cash equivalents, along with committed bank facilities, can cover debt maturing over the next 12 months.

""A rating upgrade to A3 will require ONGC to improve its liquidity profile, maintain strong credit metrics, and also for Moody's to upgrade India's sovereign rating to at least Baa1,"" the statement said.

ONGC's ratings could experience downward pressure if Moody's downgrades the sovereign's rating or the oil prices decline or the company increases its pace of acquisitions such that it faces higher business risk and a deterioration in its credit metrics.",751,0.5646604214395795

The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has deemed golf courses and sports clubs owned by central public sector enterprises as 'non-core' assets and wants to monetise them.

A recent exercise by DIPAM to assess land banks and other non-core assets of government departments as well as central PSUs identified two of ONGC's golf courses in Ahmedabad and Vadodara, as also a sports club owned by Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) in Chembur, Mumbai.

Sources said the exercise identified only properties with real estate potential in prime cities while leaving out golf courses ONGC has in Ankleshwar in Gujarat and Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh. It also did not prioritise the grand golf course Oil India Ltd (OIL) has in Assam and one ONGC has in the North-East.

While the golf courses are used by executives of the PSUs for playing the leisurely game and hosting their business partners, ONGC had built the one in Ahmedabad after it struck oil in the city more than two decades back.

After the Motera field was discovered in Ahmedabad, ONGC was wary of encroachment around the oil wells in a city that was developing into a megapolis. So it built a golf course around the wells to ward off encroachers, they said.

The golf course identified by DIPAM has two producing oil wells, sources said, adding the field exists in a nomination block that according to rules ONGC cannot sell off or farm-out to outsiders.

The DIPAM diktat has sent the company into a tizzy as selling the golf course would mean the buyer also gets ownership of the two oil wells -- something which is not allowed as per rules, they said.

A recent meeting of officials from DIPAM, NITI Aayog, Oil Ministry and other departments gave its nod to monetising non-core assets of ONGC and BPCL. The proceeds will go to the PSUs and not to the exchequer, they said, adding the aim of the exercise is to rationalise resource utilisation in the public sector.

The field may be one of the 64 that ONGC has identified for involving private and foreign firms for raising output. But even in that exercise, ONGC is retaining the ownership of the field and its licence and only getting the private partner for raising output beyond a pre-agreed threshold.

The incremental output beyond the agreed baseline will be shared with the private or foreign partner, sources said, adding ONGC as the licensee would be responsible for statutory payments such as cess on the entire oil produced.",459,

Nifty plummeted 253 points or 2.11 percent on July 8 as it continued to react negatively on the budget fine print. This is the highest single-day fall in percentage term since October 11, 2018.

From the high of 11,982 made on the day of the budget, Nifty has witnessed a fall of nearly 450 points to close at the lowest level since May 17, 2019 at 11,559.

Nifty has fallen below its 5 and 20-day simple moving average (SMA) on July 5, indicating a short-term trend which has now turned bearish.

Moreover, on July 8, Nifty also closed below its 50-DMA, placed at 11,725, which has been acting as strong support for the last 1-month. The momentum indicators and oscillators have been showing negative setup on the charts.

In the derivatives market, we have seen a short build up in the Nifty Futures on July 8. Amongst the options, we have seen Call writing at 11,700-11,800 strike prices, indicating Nifty to find strong resistance around 11,800.

Unless Nifty closes above 11,800, the trend is considered bearish for the markets. On the other hand, Bank Nifty plunged 2.77 percent on July 8, highest single day fall since Feb 2, 2018.

To conclude, the short-term trend for the Nifty50 remains bearish till the resistance of 11,800 is crossed decisively where we have seen aggressive call writing.

On the downside, support is seen in the vicinity of 11,400-11,500. Going forward, any close below 11,400 would lead to an extension of the fall towards 200-day SMA, which is placed at 11,110.

Here are three stocks that could give 5-9 percent return in the next 3-4 weeks:

Mahanagar Gas: Sell| LTP: 792| Target: Rs 755| Stop loss: Rs 815| Downside: 5 percent

The stock price gave a breakdown on the daily chart by closing below the support of Rs 806. The momentum indicators and Oscillators like MACD and RSI are showing weakness on the daily charts.

The short-term trend of the stock is bearish as the stock price slipped below its 5, 20 and 200-day SMA. In the derivatives, we have seen a short build up in the MGL Futures.

We recommend selling MGL at CMP of Rs 792 and average at Rs 800 for the target of Rs 755 and keep a stop loss placed above Rs 815.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation shares rallied nearly 4 percent intraday on July 2 after signing a memorandum of understanding with IOC for CO2 based enhanced oil recovery (EOR) by injecting CO2 captured from IOC's Koyali refinery.

""The MOU is aimed to establish a framework for mutually beneficial cooperation in the area of CO2-EOR as a mode of CCUS. The common objective is to address some of the biggest challenges of our country in particular and the world at large, namely, energy security and climate change,"" the state-owned oil and gas exploration company said in its BSE filing.

CCUS is known to be a very effective method of EOR globally and is playing an increasingly important role in achieving the mission of carbon neutrality.

""The project will add a new dimension towards the national vision of CCUS and will infuse a new life to the depleted matured oil fields of ONGC. The success of CCUS in India will not only increase domestic oil production but also cater to address India's Nationally Determined Contributions of reducing the emission intensity of GDP by 33-35 percent by 2030 as per Paris agreement,"" ONGC said.

Cairn Oil & Gas, a vertical of mining billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta Ltd, has stopped paying for its share of royalty on oil produced from its Rajasthan block following differences with partner ONGC on cost recovery.

As much as $400 million of royalty dues since July 2017 have not been paid to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), sources in know of the development said.

ONGC is the licensee of the Barmer block in Rajasthan, home to India's biggest onland oil discovery to date, and is responsible for payment of royalty at the rate of 20 percent of the oil price on the entire output from the field irrespective of its stake.

However in 2011, when ONGC gave its nod to Cairn being taken over by Vedanta, it was agreed that the two partners would pay for royalty in proportion to their share -- so Cairn was to pay for royalty on its 70 percent share of oil and ONGC on 30 percent.

This was to be done by way of reimbursement -- ONGC would initially pay royalty on 100 percent of the oil produced and Cairn would reimburse it for 70 percent soon after.

Sources said this reimbursement stopped in July 2017 with only sporadic payments coming in some months.

Reached for comments through a detailed questionnaire, a Cairn spokesperson said, ""The suggestion that Cairn has outstanding dues towards the joint venture partner is incorrect"", without elaborating.

ONGC officials confirmed dispute between the partners and problems in receiving royalty reimbursements from Cairn.

Sources said the royalty reimbursement stopped followed dispute over recovery of exploration cost.

The government had a few years back allowed exploration for oil and gas within an area that already has an oil or gas discovery and has been earmarked as production area.

The exploration cost so incurred was allowed to be deducted as expense from revenue earned from sale of oil. Profit earned after allowing for such exploration and development expense was to be shared with the partners and the government.

However, ONGC disputed some of the exploration expense incurred by Cairn and did not agree to them being cost recovered. Cairn initiated an arbitration against ONGC to resolve the issue, they said.

The company spokesperson, without directly saying an arbitration has been initiated, said: ""An operation of this scale and complexity, as a matter of course has varied perspectives among different stakeholders. The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) provides several mechanisms to resolve such routine issues, which are regularly pursued by the parties involved to make sure we all keep moving forward in the interest of the nation.""

Sources said the genus of the dispute is the exploration cost incurred within the producing area in the Rajasthan block.

The Rajasthan block was in the early 1990s awarded to Royal Dutch Shell. Shell held 100 percent interest in the block and ONGC, as per the contract, was made the licensee and given rights to back-in or take 30 percent stake in any oil or gas discovery made in the future.

The idea was that the exploration risk is taken by the private firm. The state-owned company was not supposed to pay for the exploration risk.

Shell did not find any hydrocarbon in the block and sold it to British explorer Cairn Energy plc a few years later. Cairn discovered the biggest onland oil field in the block, which was put to production a decade back.

In 2011, Vedanta bought out Cairn's India operations, including the Rajasthan block.

The permission of ONGC, being the licensee of the block, was prerequisite for such transfer and the state-owned firm gave its nod subject to Cairn paying for royalty on its share of oil.

Sources said after the government allowed for exploration within a development area, Cairn spent money on finding newer oil and gas deposits and even drilled some wells.

But since contractually ONGC is not supposed to pay for exploration risk, disputes over certain costs incurred by Cairn arose, the sources said, adding the differences typically were about the value of tender and the actual award and inclusion of some past cost as exploration expense.

""The ONGC - Cairn JV in Rajasthan has produced more than 500 million barrels over the last 10 years and today contributes to more than 20 percent of India's domestic production. The JV has had several remarkable achievements that include world class facilities in the middle of the desert, the world's longest continuously heated and insulated pipeline, and one of the world's biggest polymer projects for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR).

""We are now coming up with the flagship Alkali Surfactant Polymer (ASP) project, which will be a first of its kind,"" the Cairn spokesperson said in an e-mail response to PTI's questionnaire.",792,-0.4907724956671397

India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp on Friday said it had issued a tender seeking partners to work with it on boosting output from 64 small oil and gas fields that were handed to the state-run firm without competition.

It said companies could bid individually or in groups to work with ONGC on the fields, located in 17 areas and estimated to hold reserves of 300 million tonnes of oil equivalent.

India, the world's third-largest oil consumer, currently buys over 80 percent of its supplies from abroad.

But Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to cut the nation's dependence on foreign oil to 67 percent by 2022.

Companies that work with ONGC will be free to market and sell their share of oil and gas output as they like for up to 20 years, ONGC said.

Government headhunter Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) on June 17 called ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker to assist in selecting the new Director (Finance) of HPCL, a move seen as a stamp of approval for ONGC being the parent of HPCL, sources in know of the development said.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) in January last year bought the government's entire 51.11 percent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore. HPCL thereafter became its subsidiary but HPCL management has continuously refused to recognise ONGC as its promoter.

In regulatory filings for five consecutive quarters, HPCL listed ""President of India"" as its promoter with ""zero"" percent shareholding. ONGC was listed as ""public shareholder"", owning ""77.88 crores"" shares or ""51.11 percent"" shareholding of the company.

Sources said the chairman of ONGC, as a result of it being the holding company of HPCL, by rule was invited to be on the interview panel to select the director and that would in a way end all the wrangling over the promoter issue.

HPCL Director (Finance) J Ramaswamy retired on February 28 and interviews for the post held by PESB on June 17 selected R Kesavan, who currently is an executive director in HPCL, according to a notice put out by the government headhunter.

For selecting the director of a company where the government or its controlled company has more than 50 percent stake, a PESB panel interviews shortlisted candidates. The panel is assisted by the Secretary of the administrative ministry and the chairman of the company concerned.

The Department of Personnel guidelines state that ""in the case of subsidiaries, the full-time Chairman of the holding Company is invited to assist the Board.""

Sources said going by these guidelines, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director was invited to sit on the interview panel to select HPCL Director (Finance). HPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana, who till now used to sit on the interview panels to select directors of the company, was not called.

They said Coal India Ltd's governance structure, which the HPCL management has so often cited, clearly provides for the holding company chairman to sit on the panel for selecting directors of subsidiary companies.

Coal India Ltd is a holding company and has seven subsidiaries. The board of each of the subsidiaries is headed by a chairman and Coal India too has a chairman and managing director to head the board. But on PESB interview panels to select a director or chairman of subsidiary companies, Coal India CMD is invited.

Sources said the government had earlier this year asked HPCL to add ONGC as its co-promoter but the oil refining company sought to delay it by seeking further clarifications.

While the promoter tag does not bring any specific privileges to ONGC, a lack of it keeps it out of insider trading regulations as it get full agenda of every board meeting of HPCL and can be aware of price sensitive information.

ONGC, which had to borrow Rs 24,876 crore for the acquisition that helped the government meet its disinvestment target for the 2017-18 fiscal, first raised the issue of being formally recognised as a promoter of HPCL in August last year.

When the issue first arose in August 2018, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had clearly stated that ONGC is the new promoter of HPCL.

ONGC, he had said, had invested in acquiring a majority stake in the company and so it is the promoter. ""ONGC is the promoter of HPCL,"" he had said.

According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India's rules, the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company.

When Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had bought the government's stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd, it was listed as the latter's promoter in every instance after the deal. The same was the case when IOC acquired a majority stake in Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd (CPCL).

HPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana has retained the title of CMD despite corporate governance structure require a group having just one chairman and subsidiaries being run by managing directors and CEOs.

ONGC's overseas subsidiary, ONGC Videsh Ltd, is headed by a Managing Director and CEO. Its refinery subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), which is listed on BSE, too is led by a Managing Director and CEO. ONGC Chairman is the head of boards of both the companies.

Since acquiring a majority stake in HPCL, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board.",802,-0.9090672731399536

ICICI Direct's research report on ONGC

ONGC declared its Q4FY19 results that were below our estimates on the profitability front due to lower own oil production, write-offs, provision and impairment. As per expectations, the quarter saw nil subsidy burden while net realisations were at US$61.9/bbl (marginally above our estimate). Revenues came in above our estimates at Rs 26758.5 crore despite lower own oil production as JV sales volume and revenues were above estimates. EBITDA during the quarter came in at Rs 14387.4 crore, below our estimate of Rs 13337.7 crore mainly on account of higher than estimated other expenses. PAT was at Rs 4044.6 crore (our estimate of Rs 5791.4 crore).

Outlook

The movement in oil prices and subsidy sharing will decide ONGC’s performance, going ahead. We assume nil subsidy burden due to decline in oil prices and the new government. We model oil prices of US$65/bbl for FY20E and FY21E, given the current oil market scenario. However, due to lower growth on a sustainable basis, in spite of lower valuation, we have a HOLD rating on the stock at current levels with a target price of Rs 180/share (core business at Rs 143/share & investments at Rs 37share).

ONGC produces bulk of India's oil and gas from fields off the west coast, with several of its installations on these housing its operational personnel.

Sources said the company has not evacuated any of its personnel from the living quarters on the western offshore fields like Mumbai High and Bassein but has stopped helicopter sorties to wellheads.

Two emergency control rooms have been set up in Mumbai and Hazira in Gujarat to keep a close watch on the situation as it develops, they said adding helicopters and a multi-support vessel (MSV) have been kept on standby for any rescue and relief operation that may be warranted post Cyclone Vayu hits landfall.

Operations are largely unaffected, they said.

A floating oil production system at D-1 field off the west coast faced power failure which is being restored.

ONGC has 3-4 well drilling rigs operating in the western offshore region that falls in the path of Cyclone Vayu but no evacuation has been ordered as the intensity of the cyclone is not very severe, sources said.

The company has however taken precautions to ensure that wind speeds do not damage the rigs or tilt them.

""As a standard operating procedure (SOP), helicopter sorties are restricted the moment wind speed in offshore crosses 25 knots. In the present cyclone, wind speeds of 35-50 knots are expected,"" a source said.

Cyclone Vayu, with wind speeds equivalent to those of a Category 1 hurricane, is set to cross the coast in Gujarat by Thursday morning with sustained wind speeds of 145-155 km per hour.

The state government is evacuating about 3 lakh people from the most vulnerable areas into shelters.

Gujarat houses three oil refineries including the country's biggest and has multiple ports.

Reliance Industries' twin refineries at Jamnagar and Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy's Vadinar unit are on high alert but operations are not impacted, sources said.

Unlike these two, Indian Oil Corp's (IOC) Koyali refinery is away from the coast.

While the country's largest port operator, Adani Ports, has activated a disaster management plan at all its assets along the Gujarat coast, including Hazira, Dahej, Tuna and Mundra ports, Sikka Ports and Terminals, which handles crude oil and refined products for Reliance, has halted vessel berthing after the cyclone warning.

Cargo operations at all ports in the Gulf of Khambat (Cambay) have been temporarily suspended as a precautionary measure.

Also, operations have been suspended at Chhara, Pipavav, Salaya, Okha, Porbandar and many other small and medium ports. Kandla port operations have been temporarily suspended and employees sent on leave, sources said.",457,-0.5716958284378052

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and mining billionaire Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd are set to win nine oil and gas blocks each in the latest auction, while Reliance Industries and its British partner BP Plc is set to win KG basin gas block.

Sources said the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) has completed the evaluation of the bids received for 32 oil and gas exploration blocks that were auctioned in the latest licensing round.

As per the bid evaluation, ONGC and Vedanta Ltd are top bidders in nine blocks each and state-owned Oil India Ltd (OIL) in 12 areas.

Reliance-BP combine outbid ONGC in one Krishna Godavari basin block in the Bay of Bengal.

The winners of the auction will be announced after the approval of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sources added.

Bidding for 14 blocks on offer in the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) round-II and another 18 oil and gas blocks and 5 coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks on offer in OALP-III closed on May 15.

Reliance-BP had made their first bid in eight years when they sought an area that previously was held by ONGC, sources said.

When the government in July 2017 allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bring about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration, Reliance-BP sought the KG area containing the discoveries.

Under the new policy, areas sought by any company are put on auction with the initiator or the company that originally carved out the block, getting a 5 point advantage.

Sources said Reliance-BP managed to get the coveted KG block in the latest auction by a small margin that possibly came from the originator marks and a commitment to do a shale core exploration.

Reliance-BP had last jointly bid for a KG deep water block in the 8th bid round under previous licensing policy in 2008. They, however, gave up the block after not finding any commercially exploitable oil and gas reserves.

In the following year, Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance on its own bid for six blocks in the ninth round of New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) but did not win any block.

Sources said at the close of bidding for the current round on May 15, ONGC had put in bids for 20 out of the 32 blocks on offer, while OIL made bids for 16 blocks.

Vedanta, which had walked away with 41 out of the 55 blocks offered in OALP-I last year, bid for 30 areas.

Indian Oil Corp (IOC), GAIL (India) and SunPetro bid for two blocks each, they said.

BP had more than a decade back entered the country buying 30 per cent stake in Reliance's 21 oil and gas exploration blocks for USD 7.2 billion. All but a couple of blocks have since been relinquished.

NELP has since been replaced by Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy (HELP) under which OALP bids round have been held.

Under the new policy, called open acreage licensing policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest or EoI for prospecting of oil and gas in any area that is presently not under any production or exploration licence.

The EoIs can be put in at any time of the year but they are accumulated twice annually.

The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage.

The two windows of accumulating EoIs end on May 15 and November 15 every year. EoIs accumulated till May 15 are supposed to be put on auction by June 30 and those in the second window by December 31.

But a delay in offering of blocks meant that OALP-II and OALP-III ran concurrently.

While the OALP-I round saw an investment commitment of about Rs 60,000 crore, the government is expecting about 90,000 crore of investment in the latest round.

In OALP-1, Vedanta walked away with 41 out of 55 blocks bid out. Oil India won nine blocks while ONGC managed to win just two.

Blocks are awarded to the company which offers the highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells.

The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block.

HDFC Securities' research report on ONGC

Q4FY19 Revenue/EBITDA were up 11.6/8.7% YoY to Rs 267.58/123.71bn owing to 5.6% jump in oil price realisation to Rs 4,365/bbl and NG realisation was up 20.2% YoY to USD3.5/mmbtu. Crude oil sales volumes were down 0.7% YoY to 5.9mmt. APAT was down 31.6% YoY and came to Rs 40.45bn owning to 19.4% and 50.5% increase in Exploration write-off and depreciation and depletion cost. EBITDA was 11% below our estimates owing to (1) Unpaid royalty of Rs 10.14bn on behalf of its JV partner (Vedanta) from 15-Aug-18 to 31-Dec-18 that has wholly been accounted for in Q4, (2) Rs 6bn of provision made towards arbitration case against GoI relating to certain disputes and claims arising in connection with

Production Sharing Contracts of PMT fields. Adjusting for the one-off expenses and provisions, EBITDA stood at Rs 139.85bn, which was in-line with our estimates. Revenue for FY19 was up 29% YoY to Rs 1,096.55bn owing to 34% jump in oil price realisation to Rs 4,766/bbl and NG realisation was up 19.1% YoY to USD3.32/mmbtu. Crude oil sales volumes were down 5% YoY to 22.5mmt and gas sales volume was up 5.1% to 20.5bcm.

Outlook

Upstream companies were out of flavour despite realizing market price for crude oil, mainly on account of lower provisioning of budgetary support in FY19 (Rs 248bn). The subsidy sharing concern allayed when the Govt. committed to settle Rs 430bn of subsidy from its own pocket. We do not foresee any subsidy sharing burden on upstream companies if crude oil prices remain below USD80/bbl. In the absence of overhang of subsidy sharing, upstream companies should be re-rated. Our TP is Rs 191/sh (8x Mar-21E standalone core EPS (adj. for dividend income), + OVL EPS and Rs 39 from other investments).

National oil companies (NOCs) worldwide are currently retailoring their business strategies in response to climate-change imperatives and developing energy transition changes, Moody's said in a report that studies how state-sponsored oil companies are preparing against energy transition risk.

India's energy strategy, it said, aims to reduce its hydrocarbon imports by 10 percent by 2020 through several measures -- increasing domestic production, adopting biofuels and renewables, improving energy efficiency norms, improving refinery processes and prompting crude demand substitution.

The country aims to have 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022, reduce its energy-emissions intensity by 33-35 percent by 2030, and raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its electricity mix to more than 40 percent by 2030.

""Despite such efforts, fossil fuels will continue to occupy a significant share of India's energy demand for the foreseeable future,"" Moody's said.

As India's largest NOC, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is aligned with the government's aim to reduce India's dependence on energy imports, which make up more than 80 percent of its oil consumption and more than 40 percent of its natural gas consumption today, it said.

The government has also pushed to reduce hydrocarbon consumption by offering incentives for the use of electric vehicles, and mandating minimum blending requirements of 20 percent for biodiesel and 5 percent for ethanol by 2030.

Moody's said although natural gas made up 44 percent of ONGC's sales, it only accounted for about 17 percent of total sales revenue.

""ONGC aims to increase natural gas production over the next few years as it develops its new discovery on the eastern coast of India. However, natural gas will not contribute heavily to ONGC's profitability for the near term,"" it said.

This may be because of the government fixing rates of natural gas it produces.

The government has mandated a maximum price of $3.69 per million British thermal unit for most of the gas that ONGC produces during April to September 2019 period. This rate is below the cost of production for most fields.

Moody's said the recent acquisition of a stake in Russia's Vankorneft fields increases ONGC's crude reserves in that country. Also, ONGC has acquired a majority stake in refining and marketing company Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL).

""Among other environmental efforts, ONGC has made forays into renewables, with 153 MW of installed wind energy capacity and 18 MW of solar energy, though such amounts are insignificant for a company of its size.

""ONGC also has 15 registered Clean Development Mechanism projects with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, yielding about 2.1 million in annual potential certified emissions reductions, or CERs,"" it said.

The company is also implementing paperless transactions across the organization -- a move that it says will save 100 million pages, or about 7,500 trees annually -- while steadily reducing gas flaring in its operations and cutting its use of plastics, particularly single-use plastics.

Moody's study of more than 20 NOCs from around the world explains how these companies are responding to climate-change initiatives, in particular, the Paris Agreement.

""Some companies are changing for business reasons and others as a de facto part of their sponsoring governments, while still others are as yet responding only minimally,"" said Steven Wood, a Moody's Managing Director.

In Asia, China's NOCs CNPC, Sinopec and CNOOC Group are all pursuing national emissions-reduction strategies mainly by ramping up natural gas production and transportation efforts, Wood says.

ONGC of India is also aiming to increase natural gas production, while Malaysia's PETRONAS, which has significant energy transition exposure, has begun to build its renewable energy business.",635,0.6997052601405552

Global brokerage firms remained positive on state-owned oil & gas exploration company ONGC despite a weak Q4 show, with CLSA expecting a big re-rating on the stock.

Reiterating buy call on the stock and raising price target to Rs 285 from Rs 240, CLSA raised its EPS estimates by 14-18 percent for FY20-21, though a slew of one-offs caused a big miss in Q4.

""Q4 standalone PAT was well below estimates on one-off charges & impairments. EBITDA missed by a smaller 5 percent,"" the brokerage said, adding Q4 results confirmed a subsidy exemption for FY19.

CLSA believes that subsidy burden fears should be allayed.

Macquarie also has an outperform call on ONGC with a price target at Rs 210, though Q4 EBITDA-EPS was significantly below consensus and estimates.

The state-run oil company reported a massive 51 percent year-on-year degrowth in profit at Rs 4,044 crore for the quarter ended March 2019.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) May 30 reported a 31 per cent drop in its March quarter net profit as it faced a double whammy of a drop in production and fall in prices.

Net profit in January-March at Rs 4,045 crore was 31.6 per cent lower than net profit of Rs 5,915 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal year, the company said in a statement.

While oil production dropped 5 per cent to 4.8 million tonne, the price it realised for every barrel of crude oil sold was 3.6 per cent lower at USD 61.93.

Gas production, however, rose 8.2 per cent to 6.275 billion cubic metres. Also, gas price climbed 16.3 per cent to USD 3.36 per million British thermal unit.

Revenue was up 11.6 per cent to Rs 26,759 crore in the fourth quarter of 2018-19 as compared to Rs 23,970 crore a year back.

ONGC board approved a final dividend of 15 per cent (Rs 0.75 per share). This is on top of interim dividends of 125 per cent (Rs 6.25 a share) declared previously for 2018-19 fiscal.

""The total dividend payout for FY'19 would be Rs 8,806 crore (excluding dividend distribution tax),"" the statement said.

For the full fiscal 2018-19, net profit jumped 34 per cent to Rs 26,716 crore while revenue was up 29 per cent at Rs 109,655 crore.

ONGC said it made 13 discoveries in FY19. ""Of the 13 discoveries, 8 discoveries were made in onland (Nomination-6, NELP-2) and 5 in offshore (Nomination-2, NELP- 3). Out of 13 discoveries, 5 discoveries were monetised during the year itself,"" it said.",282,0.00010218222935994466

From a zero-debt company, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had to resort to borrowings in the past couple of years after the government asked it to acquire state-owned refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), pay record dividend and buy back shares.

Reacting to reports on the company's ability to meet its capital requirements, ONGC in a statement said,""it has strong financials in place to finance its projects both ongoing as well as upcoming ones.""

""The company's operational plans and expenditure thereon have also been in line with its requirement,"" it said. ""There is no plan or item of expense that had to be deferred due to paucity of funds/ resources.""

ONGC in 2017 bought Gujarat government firm GSPC's 80 per cent stake in a complex KG Basin gas field for Rs 7,738 crore and in January last year, it acquired the government's holding in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore.

In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, it paid hefty dividend to shareholders and completed a Rs 4,022 crore share buyback. The government was the biggest beneficiary of both dividend payout and share buyback.

These acquisitions and payouts to the government have eroded ONGC's cash reserves, which was about Rs 13,000 crore a couple of years back and has loaded its balance sheet with a debt of about Rs 20,000 crore.

Without dwelling into financial numbers, ONGC said, ""mergers and acquisitions are business decisions which have been taken by the companies to foster growth and true value accretion from such ventures gets reflected over a period of time. The acquisitions made by ONGC are going to strengthen the company's growth trajectory.""

The statement said ONGC on a standalone basis has ""a very conservative debt-equity ratio which compares favourably with global benchmarks.""

The rating of the company is also very strong compared with its peers in the industry, it said adding ONGC today is the largest integrated oil company in the country with a strong presence in the entire hydrocarbon value chain.

""The company has also been relentlessly striving to strengthen its operations in line with the energy needs of the country.

""Relentless efforts on the part of ONGC management are expected to translate into strong performance not only for its upstream business but going by the results of some of the joint ventures in pipeline and petrochemicals, the downstream units are also expected to contribute through their stronger results,"" it added.",444,0.7499784380197525

The Union Environment Ministry has given the environment clearance for six development wells in five mining lease blocks in Jorhat and Golghat districts, according to an official document.

The company had sought permission for drilling 12 development wells but it received clearance for six wells at present.

The clearance, which is subject to compliance of certain conditions, has been given after taking into consideration the recommendation of a green panel.

The total mining lease area of Jorhat and Golaghat districts is 32.116 sq km and 120.5 sq km, respectively. The total project cost is pegged at Rs 240 crore.

ONGC said the proposed project aims to enhance reliable hydrocarbon supplies, which will bring economic benefits and provide indirect employment opportunities to the local people and also benefit the area by way of improvement in existing infrastructure.

The company has obtained the first stage forest clearance for the project.

Official sources said ONGC had as a precaution halted operations, evacuated some 500 employees and towed rigs to safer waters ahead of the cyclone.

While cyclone Fani made landfall around Puri in Odisha and is moving towards West Bengal, most of ONGC installations are off the Andhra coast.

Sources said all operations have been restored and employees are being moved by boats to installations.

There is no loss of production, they said.

India's eastern coast is dotted with oil and gas installations, including three refineries and numerous rigs and offshore platforms that are used to explore and produce oil and gas.

While operations at Paradip port in Odisha and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh were shut and ships moved out to sea to avoid damage, the refineries operated normally.

Sources said ONGC had six rigs operating off the Andhra coast, four of which were moved away from the path of severe cyclonic storm Fani earlier this week.

They will be brought back to their locations over the next couple of days.

The company began evacuating staff from the rigs as early as on April 27 and had by May 1 completed evacuation of around 500 of them.

Employees will be redeployed at the installations now, they said.

Fani or the 'Hood of Snake', labelled as a category 4 storm on a scale of 1 to 5, made landfall around 8 am in Puri on Friday, with roaring winds flattening huts, enveloping the pilgrim town in sheets of rain, and submerging homes in residential areas.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), India's biggest oil and gas producer, last year completed acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,915 crore.

After this takeover, ONGC has two refining subsidiaries -- HPCL and MRPL.

Since then, HPCL is keen to get MRPL in its fold citing operational synergies. It has been talking of a combination of cash and share-swap for the deal that will make it India's third-largest oil refiner.

But now, ONGC wants only cash as HPCL shares are on the slide.

ONGC acquired the government's 51.11 percent stake in HPCL in January 2018 at Rs 473.97 per share. The same share of HPCL on Friday closed at Rs 282.60, a massive 40 percent loss in value in 15 months.

Sources said HPCL has not yet come up with a concrete proposal for acquiring MRPL and has been talking about the deal mostly through the Oil Ministry and the media.

ONGC, they said, wants HPCL to make a compelling offer to it for the merger talks to begin.

ONGC holds 71.63 percent stake in MRPL.

HPCL can acquire MRPL by buying out ONGC's shares, which at Friday's trading price is worth about Rs 9,300 crore.

The other option is share-swap, wherein ONGC will get more shares in HPCL in lieu of it giving up control in MRPL. A third option and more preferable is a combination of the two.

Sources said ONGC feels it does not want to end up with more shares of HPCL whose value has been on the decline on the stock market.

HPCL currently holds 16.96 percent stake in MRPL.

HPCL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Kumar Surana has been since January 2018 talking of the synergy MRPL acquisition will bring to the company.

For one, HPCL sells more petroleum products than it produces and bringing MRPL's 15 million tonne a year refinery under the fold would help bridge the shortfall. Also, there can be synergies in crude oil procurement as well as in optimising refinery set-up, he has been saying.

Sources, however, said HPCL has not made any firm proposal for the acquisition to ONGC.

MRPL is not a new company for HPCL. It was an HPCL company before ONGC in 2003 acquired joint venture partner A V Birla Group's stake.

HPCL has 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity. Together with 15 million tonnes refinery of MRPL, it will become India's second-biggest state-owned oil refiner after Indian Oil Corp (IOC).

Overall, it will become the third biggest refiner behind IOC and Reliance Industries.

MRPL will be the third refinery of HPCL, which already has units at Mumbai and Visakhapatnam.",476,0.44002626836299896

The country's crude oil production fell over 4 per cent in the financial year 2018-19 after aging fields of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) missed the target, official data showed on April 25.

India produced 34.2 million tonne of crude oil in the fiscal year ended March 31, down from 35.7 million tonne in the previous year, according to data released by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas here.

ONGC output dropped to 21 million tonne from 22.25 million tonne in 2017-18, while OIL saw a 2.5 per cent dip to 3.3 million tonne.

Fields in the private sector saw a production drop of nearly 2 per cent to 9.8 million tonne mainly because of lower output at Cairn India's Rajasthan oilfields.

ONGC production was lower due to technical issues at its Mumbai and Neelam Heera fields in the Arabian Sea and less than the production at Santhal and Balol fields in Gujarat.

During March, the country's total crude oil production fell to 2.85 million tonne from 3.04 million tonne in the corresponding month of the previous fiscal year.

Natural gas production, however, edged up to 32.9 billion cubic metre (BCM) in 2018-19, from 32.6 BCM in the previous year as ONGC produced 5.3 per cent more gas at 24.67 BCM.

Higher production by ONGC made up for a nearly 14 per cent drop in output from private sector fields at 5.47 BCM.

This was a result of shutting down of two more wells at Reliance Industries' eastern offshore D1-D3 gas fields in the flagging KG-D6 block, the ministry statement said.

Indian refineries produced 2 per cent higher fuel and other petroleum products at 257.2 million tonne in 2018-19 on a better showing by state-owned firms.

State-owned refiners such as Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) produced nearly 3 per cent more fuel at 151 million tonnes in 2018-19, while private sector refinery throughput was nearly 3.5 per cent lower at 88 million tonne after both Reliance Industries' Jamnagar refineries and Nayara Energy's Vadinar units in Gujarat produced less.

Twin refineries at Jamnagar produced 69.1 million tonne, down from 70.4 million tonne. Vadinar refinery throughput was nearly 9 per cent lower at 19 million tonne.",381,-0.6489029030005137

Oil retailers HPCL, BPCL and IOC fell more than a percent intraday on April 23 after crude prices moved near 2019 highs as the US moved to end all sanction exemptions to oil importers from Iran.

These stocks have fallen 7-12 percent in last one month as Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, has climbed over $70 a barrel. Crude shot 50 percent to $74.4 a barrel, from its December lows around $50 a barrel.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects global oil markets to tighten further in the near term due to full curtailment of Iran’s oil exports and the possibility of disruptions in crude supplies from Libya given escalating unrest in the country.

Hence, it has retained sell call on HPCL, BPCL and IOC, which are expected to be adversely impacted.

""We believe it is safer to avoid downstream PSUs (BPCL, HPCL and IOCL) in the near term, as current valuations ignore potential risks from any spike in crude that may put pressure on refining as well as marketing margins and bleak refining outlook,"" the brokerage said.

However, it reiterated its buy call on GAIL and ONGC, both being beneficiaries of elevated crude prices, and can act as good hedge against any spike in crude. ""We note that ONGC stock is pessimistically discounting net crude realization around $45 per barrel,"" it said.

Rising oil price is also negative for India that imports 80-85 percent of its requirement, which is why the market has been under pressure for the last few sessions.

According to the brokerage house, Iran's crude production may likely fall to around 1.8 million barrels per day, closer to the level of domestic consumption, from peak volumes of 3.8 million barrels per day in June 2018 and around 2.7 million barrels per day in Q1CY19.

Libya’s crude production of around 1.1 million barrels per day currently may also get restricted if its internal conflict reaches its oil fields or export terminals, Kotak feels.

Global oil markets have already tightened in recent months due to a voluntary reduction in supplies by OPEC+ and Canada, and restraints on Venezuelan crude exports by the US.

As per the strategic disinvestment policy framed by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), the alternative mechanism, headed by the Finance Minister, will have to take a call on whether to go ahead with single bidder or call for fresh bids.

If at all the Alternative Mechanism decides to call for fresh bids, it would be in accordance with the modified strategic sale policy being worked out by DIPAM, the official added.

In order to speed up strategic sale of state-owned companies, the DIPAM is working on streamlining the policy. It had last come out with a guidance note on strategic disinvestment in January 2018.

The government had initially planned to sell Pawan Hans last fiscal, but could not complete the process as only one bidder has shown interest.

In April last year, the government had issued the information memorandum for the 51 percent strategic stake sale in Pawan Hans and had sought expression of interest (EoI) from interested bidders by June 18.

Thereafter, the ONGC board in July decided to combine its 49 percent stake in the offer for sale by the Centre.

Following this, in August, the government invited fresh EoIs from entities, saying that along with its 51 percent stake, the bidders will also have the option to buy ONGC's stake of 49 percent in the company.

The last date for submission of EoIs was September 12. However, the total number of bidders have not made public to maintain confidentiality of the bidding process.

In February, 2019, the government shared the final share purchase agreement with the shortlisted bidders of Pawan Hans and asked them to submit their financial bids by March 6.

The government has budgeted to raise Rs 90,000 crore from disinvestment in the current fiscal, up from Rs 85,000 crore mopped up in last financial year.",446,

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) in January last year bought the government's entire 51.11 percent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore. HPCL thereafter became its subsidiary but HPCL management has continuously refused to recognise ONGC as its promoter.

In a regulatory filing on shareholding pattern at the end of March quarter, HPCL on April 18 listed ""President of India"" as its promoter with ""zero"" percent shareholding. ONGC was listed as ""public shareholder"", owning ""77.88 crores"" shares or ""51.11 percent"" shareholding of the company.

Sources said HPCL may be taking shield of technicalities to not list ONGC as its promoter but it will face a real test when interviews to fill the post of Director (Finance) are conducted.

The chairman of ONGC, as a result of the company being the holding company of HPCL, should by rules be on the interview panel to select the directors and that would in a way end all the wrangling over promoter issue, they said.

HPCL Director (Finance) J Ramaswamy retired on February 28 but interviews for the post haven't been done yet by the government headhunter Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB).

For selecting a director of a company where the government or its controlled company has more than 50 percent stake, a PESB panel holders interview from among shortlisted candidates. The panel is assisted by the Secretary of the administrative ministry and the chairman of the company concerned.

The Department of Personnel guidelines state ""in the case of subsidiaries, the full-time Chairman of the holding Company is invited to assist the Board.""

Sources said going by these guidelines, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker should sit on the interview panel to select HPCL Director (Finance).

They said Coal India Ltd governance structure, which the HPCL management has so often cited, clearly provides for the holding company chairman to sit on the panel for selecting directors of subsidiary companies.

Coal India Ltd is a holding company and has seven subsidiaries. The board of each of the subsidiaries is headed by a Chairman and Coal India too has a Chairman and Managing Director to head the board. But on PESB panel to select director or even chairman of subsidiary companies, Coal India Chairman and Managing Director is invited.

Sources said the government had earlier this year asked HPCL to add ONGC as its co-promoter but the oil refining company sought to delay it by seeking further clarifications.

While the promoter tag does not bring any specific privileges to ONGC, a lack of it keeps it out of insider trading regulations as it get full agenda of every board meeting of HPCL and can be aware of price sensitive information.

ONGC, which had to borrow Rs 24,876 crore for the acquisition that helped the government meet its disinvestment target for the 2017-18 fiscal, first raised the issue of being formally recognised as a promoter of HPCL in August last year.

When the issue first arose in August 2018, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had clearly stated that ONGC is the new promoter of HPCL.

ONGC, he had said, had invested in acquiring a majority stake in the company and so it is the promoter. ""ONGC is the promoter of HPCL,"" he had said.

After ONGC bought out government stake, HPCL became its subsidiary. Since ONGC takeover in January 2018, HPCL has made five stock exchange filings about the shareholding pattern of the company -- the first on April 20, 2018, then on July 12, 2018, then on October 19, 2018, then on January 21, 2019 and finally on April 18, 2019. In all four, ONGC is shown as the public shareholder and President of India listed as the promoter.

According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India's rules, the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company.

When Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had bought the government's stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd, it was listed as the latter's promoter in every instance after the deal. The same was the case when IOC acquired a majority stake in Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd (CPCL).

HPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana has retained the title of Chairman and Managing Director despite corporate governance structure require a group having just one chairman and subsidiaries being run by managing directors and CEOs.

ONGC's overseas subsidiary, ONGC Videsh Ltd, is headed by a Managing Director and CEO. Its refinery subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), which is listed on BSE, too is led by a Managing Director and CEO. ONGC Chairman is the head of boards of both the companies.

Since acquiring a majority stake in HPCL, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board.",841,-0.9090672731399536

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has arrested a declining crude oil production trend in its onshore fields and registered a 1.25 percent rise in output in the fiscal year ended March 2019, top company officials said.

ONGC produced 6.141 million tonnes of crude oil from its onshore fields despite majority of them being more than 50 years old and facing a natural decline.

The company has been able to make a production turnaround through a slew of initiatives, they said.

India's largest oil and gas producer has in recent times faced immense pressure from the government, which has blamed it for the continuing decline in the country's output.

ONGC raising output is critical to meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of cutting oil imports by 10 percent by 2022.

ONGC has already reversed years of decline in natural gas output, posting a record 6.5 percent jump in production to 25.9 billion cubic metres in 2018-19.

However, oil production from offshore fields continues to be on a decline and will only reverse next year when Krishna Godavari basin field KG-DWN-98/2 comes onstream.

Officials said ONGC has monetised five out of the total 13 discoveries during 2018-19 on a fast-track mode which helped contribute to the growth in production from onshore fields.

In order to sustain production and achieve higher onshore growth, ONGC drilled 303 wells during the last fiscal, which is the highest since 2014-15.

The company has also engaged reputed international oil and gas consulting firm Gaffney Cline & Associates for high level review of two major fields of largest onshore producing asset, Mehsana in Gujarat and a few other onshore fields for enhancement of production.

The company has invested about Rs 5,000 crore in the last fiscal in its onshore operations on a number of projects and has a similar investment plan for the financial year 2019-20, officials said.

Talking about the performance, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker said: ""The growth in onshore production has been achieved beating enormous challenges which cropped up due to ageing of the fields. This has come at a time when fields with similar vintage are facing a sharp decline internationally.""

""The onshore fields, which are mostly five-decade old, are faced with increased level of water-cut (the water which comes with oil during production),"" he said, adding ""while disposing of produced water is a critical issue, the stringent environmental laws and complex land acquisition process make the challenges in onshore quite difficult to surmount.""

Shanker said a well-wise focused approach and deploying state-of-the-technology for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) have started paying a rich dividend in not only arresting the decline in production trend but also to grow.

ONGC Director (Onshore) S K Moitra said the company continues to take up various initiatives on the EOR front and as many as six EOR projects have been either implemented or are on the verge of implementation.",494,0.2718632871454412

Natural gas production from ONGC-operated nomination fields, NELP blocks and joint venture assets reached 25.819 BCM in 2018-19 as compared to 24.61 BCM output in the previous fiscal, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker said.

The company is on course to produce 42 BCM by end of fiscal 2022, when its prized KG basin discoveries will come onstream.

""Some of our gas fields are very old like the Bassien field in western offshore. These continue to make a substantial contribution to the overall domestic production of gas because of continuous monitoring of the fields, applications of state-of-the-art technology and best possible reservoir management,"" Shanker said.

A bulk of the output in the 2018-19 financial year came from fields that were given to ONGC on nomination basis. Gas output from these rose to 24.683 BCM against 23.43 BCM in the previous 2017-18 fiscal.

There has been a marginal increase in the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) fields also from 0.054 BCM to 0.073 BCM.

The growth rate was higher than the global average of 3-4 percent year-on-year.

Natural gas is the fastest growing primary energy source in the world. It is the cleanest burning petroleum-based fuel and has wide applications -- from being used to generate electricity to the running of automobiles (CNG) and firing kitchen stoves.

Aiming to reduce dependence on imports for meeting energy needs and cutting greenhouse emissions, India is looking at increasing consumption of natural gas by more than doubling its share in energy basket to 15 percent by 2030.

Shanker said, gas sales also recorded an impressive increase during the year with sales (provisional) standing at 20.472 BCM against the sales of 19.494 BCM in 2017-18.

During 2018-19, the company has, for the first time in its six-decade-old history, witnessed the highest ever gas production of 71 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) in November 2018.

ONGC, he said, is taking all measures to sustain the production level and then grow further as per the company's operational blueprint.

The company has stepped up efforts to bring newer fields into production after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a stiff target of reducing oil import dependence by 10 percent by 2022. India currently imports over 80 percent of its oil needs.

The growth in output was largely contributed by C-26 Cluster fields, Daman and Vasai East fields in the western offshore as well as sub-sea well S2AB in the eastern offshore, he said adding ONGC has charted out a plan to double the gas production at 42.7 BCM by 2021-22.

It is investing Rs 57,000 crore - one of the highest investments in the world in gas projects - in the high potential KG-DWN-98/2 project in the Bay of Bengal as well as in developing other discoveries on off the west coast.

First gas from the KG-DWN-98/2 project is targeted for end-2019 and peak output is envisaged at 16.56 mmscmd by 2022.

Giving details of projects that contributed to the increase, he said the incremental production came from Daman Offshore in the West as well as S1 –Vashishta in the eastern offshore. Some of the onshore fields too saw the trend of falling output reversed.

The Daman project has been completed at an investment of Rs 6,086 crore for a production profile of 26.93 BCM over a period of time. The project contributed 4.5 mmscmd last fiscal.

Similarly, ONGC has drawn an investment plan of Rs 5,725 crore for Vashishta and S1 for total gas production of 14.61 BCM. Current production from the project stands at 3 mmscmd.

One of the major breakthrough On-shore projects is Tripura Gas Project for which an investment plan of Rs 5,000 crore is being drawn up to recover 49.37 BCM gas up to the profile period. Current gas production from the block is 4.5 mmscmd.",683,0.9486524105072022

State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) on Tuesday declared a second interim dividend of Rs 1,412 crore for the current financial year and ONGC agreed to do so next week to help the government meet its tax revenue target. In a stock exchange filing, IOC, the nation's biggest oil firm, said its board at a meeting on Tuesday approved payment of Rs 1.50 per share of 15 per cent in second interim dividend for 2018-19 to shareholders.

""The dividend will be credited to the account of the shareholders or the dividend warrant in respect thereof will be dispatched on or before April 10, 2019,"" it said.

The government owns 53.88 per cent stake in IOC and stands to get about Rs 761 crore, excluding dividend distribution tax.

Separately, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which had initially resisted a government demand seeking a second interim dividend, said a board meeting has been convened on March 23 to consider and declare an interim dividend.

Grappling with a possible Rs 80,000 crore shortfall in direct and indirect tax revenues that will make it difficult to meet a revised fiscal deficit target, the government has been tapping cash-rich PSUs for second interim dividend.

Coal India Ltd on March 14 declared a second interim dividend of Rs 5.85 per share.

The government holds 72.91 per cent stake in Coal India and stands to get Rs 2,647 crore, excluding dividend tax.

Initially, ONGC had resisted paying a second interim dividend on grounds that it does not have surplus cash to make such payments within a month of an interim dividend payout, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.

According to regulations, a company cannot declare a second dividend within a month of the previous payout and companies like ONGC would need to seek approval of markets regulator Sebi to make such a payment.

Sources said the government is struggling to meet the revised fiscal deficit target of 3.4 per cent in view of the shortfall in goods and services tax (GST) collections.

GST shortfall is likely to be around Rs 30,000-40,000 crore and a similar shortfall is expected in direct tax collections as well, they said.

IOC in December declared Rs 6.75 per share interim dividend alongside a Rs 4,435-crore share buyback to help the government meet its revenue targets.

ONGC had announced an interim dividend of Rs 5.25 per equity share on February 14. It also had approved a Rs 4,022-crore share buyback.

Last month, while presenting the annual budget for 2019-20, the government had revised upward its fiscal deficit target to 3.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the current financial year from the previously estimated 3.3 per cent budgeted target.

In absolute terms, the fiscal deficit, the gap between the Centre's expenditure and revenue, has been pegged at Rs 6.34 lakh crore for 2018-19.

During the April-January period, fiscal deficit touched Rs 7.70 lakh crore, or 121.5 per cent of the budgeted target for the current fiscal year ending March 31, government data showed.

For the current fiscal, direct tax collection has been pegged at Rs 12 lakh crore while the revised estimate for GST collections has been put at Rs 6.43 lakh crore, which is lower than the targeted Rs 7.43 lakh crore.",554,-0.6264534831047058

State-owned ONGC's nine biggest oil and gas fields, including Mumbai High and Vasai East, came tantalisingly close to being sold to private and foreign companies but the plan was nixed after strong opposition from within the government, sources said.

A high-level committee headed by Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar late last year considered ""transferring"" western offshore oil and gas fields of Mumbai High, Heera, D-1, Vasai East and Panna as well as Greater Jorajan and Geleki field in Assam, Baghewala in Rajasthan and Kalol oilfield in Gujarat to private/foreign companies.

Multiple sources in Niti Aayog and government said, the plan to give away fields producing 95 per cent of India's current oil and gas could not go through because of very strong opposition from Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) as well as some quarters within the government who found something amiss in the proposal.

Besides the 9 fields, 149 marginal fields, that contribute about 5 per cent of the domestic production, were to be clustered and bid out.

While ONGC opposed giving away on a platter to private/foreign sector what it discovered after years of toil and spending billions of dollars over last four decades, some in government were not convinced by the incremental potential toyed with to get the proposal through, they said adding it wasn't clear how the incremental output numbers were arrived at in absence of any real basin or field study by the panel.

The proposal brought before the panel, which was appointed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October last year to boost stagnant output from aging fields of public sector oil companies, was to give private/foreign companies complete marketing and pricing freedom after getting from them an enhanced production profile for the fields.

National oil companies (NOCs) were to get 10 per cent of incremental output over business as usual (BAU) scenario, sources said.

This was a second attempt to take away some of the fields of ONGC for giving to private and foreign companies.

In October 2017, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had identified 15 producing fields with collective reserve of 791.2 million tonne of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas of NOCs for handing over to private firms in the hope they would improve upon the baseline estimate and their extraction.

The plan, however, could not go through as ONGC strongly countered the DGH proposal with its own proposal that it be allowed to outsource operations on the same terms as the government plan.

Private and foreign companies have generally shied away from taking up exploration blocks and have instead been lobbying for getting a stake in producing oil and gas fields of ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL) saying they can raise output by bringing in capital and technology.

NOCs, on the other hand, contend that they do not have pricing and marketing freedom and they too can get the technology given the same is provided.

The final report that the Rajiv Kumar-led committee submitted on January 29, had watered down the proposal by recommending freedom to NOCs to choose field specific implementation model including farm out, joint venture or technical service model for raising output from the fields that contribute 95 per cent of the current output.

Pricing and marketing freedom for any new field development plan that they bring was also recommended.

Sources said, 64 small and marginal fields of ONGC and two of OIL were recommended to be bid out within four months and NOCs allowed to retain 54 others (49 by ONGC and 3 by OIL) where enhanced oil recovery/improved oil recovery schemes were under implementation.

The recommendations have been accepted by the government.

The overhauled policy notified by the government provides for complete marketing and pricing freedom for oil and gas produced from areas bid out in future bid rounds.

Oil and gas acreage or blocks in all future bid rounds will be awarded primarily on the basis of exploration work commitment, it said adding companies will not have to share any profit with the government on oil and gas produced from less explored areas.",695,0.9741173982620239

The proceeds from the ETF sale will help the government move towards meeting the Rs 80,000 crore disinvestment target set for the current fiscal.

As on February 28, the government has realised Rs 56,473.32 crore as disinvestment proceeds against the target of Rs 80,000 crore during the current financial year (2018-19).

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Thursday signed a contract for the prolific Chinnewala Tibba gas field in Rajasthan, which it had discovered around 15 years ago but was taken away and auctioned by the government.

ONGC won back five out of the 23 discovered oil and gas fields that the government took away from the state-owned firm and Oil India Ltd (OIL) for auctioning in the second round of discovered small field (DSF).

The 72-square kilometer field near Jaisalmer in Rajasthan has 1,900 million standard cubic metres of reserves, an official of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons said at the contract-signing ceremony with the winners of the 23 fields auctioned in DSF-II.

The 23 fields, made up of some 57 discoveries by ONGC and OIL, hold 190 million tonnes of oil and oil-equivalent gas resources, the official said.

Speaking on the occasion, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said DSF bid rounds are aimed at raising domestic production to cut dependence on imported oil.

India is 83 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs.

""Maximising production is the most important priority now,"" he said.

While ONGC and OIL could not monetise the discoveries auctioned in the DSF round mainly due to they being financially unviable on prevalent fiscal terms, DSF round winners will get complete pricing and marketing freedom that will make the finds economically viable.

Pradhan said ONGC was asked to largely stay away from DSF-I round last year but was given freedom to bid in DSF-II and he was happy that the company walked away with the most number of fields.

Chinnewala Tibba was the most-contested field in DSF-II with as many as 17 bids being put in. ONGC won the field as also four others after bid evaluation and award was completed last week.

Contracts for the same were signed Thursday. OIL and Vedanta Ltd signed contracts for two fields each they had won while lesser known Ganges Geo-Resources Pvt Ltd signed for five fields.

State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and its partner Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Ltd (HOEC) signed for one field they won in the auction.

Arch Softwares Pvt Ltd, a firm backed by former Cairn India executive Suniti Bhat, won two offshore fields.

The remaining fields went to little-known firms such as Shanti GD Ispat Power, Arsh Corporate Services, Invenire Energy, Keerthi Industries, and Gem Petro E&P.

On the contract signing, Vedanta Resources Ltd Executive Chairman Anil Agarwal said: ""The Government of India has taken concrete steps to encourage and thus enhance domestic crude oil production, in line with Minister Pradhan's vision of energy self-sufficiency. The discovered small fields Round-II auction is another significant step in this direction. We remain committed to optimising exploration and production from the fields awarded to us. These reformative steps and our demonstrated success will pave the way for attracting future foreign investments as well.""

Sudhir Mathur, chief executive officer of oil and gas business of Vedanta Ltd, said the company is known for its engineering strength and innovation, especially in the tight oil and tight gas domain. ""We are excited to bring these strengths to bear in the two new DSF fields awarded to us. We congratulate the government on all of these progressive initiatives that will lead to growth in the sector, job creation, and prosperity for our country.""

As many as 39 firms, including six foreign players, had put in 145 bids for 24 out of the 25 oil and gas fields on offer in DSF-II at the close of bidding on January 30. Mining giant Vedanta put in the highest number of bids for 21 fields.

A DGH statement said one bid for a field has been kept in abeyance as the matter is sub-judice.

ONGC and OIL had put in bids for 10 fields each while Indian Oil Corp (IOC) bid for 3.

British company Soco International made its foray into India, bidding for one field but it failed to make a dent. Arch Softwares had put in bids for 15 fields.",681,0.9993263632059097

""Tripura produces 4.96 mmscmd gas per day which is highest in the country. But we want to augment productions, so we have set a target of producing 10 mmscmd per day,"" Pradhan said after inaugurating several projects by remote here.

The Petroleum and Natural Gas minister said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is focused on improving the standard of living for the people of North East. Collaborative efforts of both Central and state governments along with contribution by oil and gas companies are bringing a developmental shift in the economy of Tripura.

Pradhan inaugurated the ONGC Sonamura Gas Collecting Station (GCS) in Sipahijala district, Piped Natural Gas (PNG) connections in West Tripura district, laid foundation of the first CNG station at Udaipur in Gomati district and foundation stone of National Skill Training Institute for women to be set up at Ananda Nagar, near here.

He said the ONGCs Sonamura Gas Collecting Station (GCS) was built at a cost of Rs 215 crore and will provide additional gas to NEEPCO Monarchak Power Plant to generate power for Tripura and northeast region.

Pradhan said the launch of first CNG Station will create a CNG green corridor between South Tripura, Gomati, Sepahijala and West Tripura district and also provide cost effective green fuel to the people.

The Petroleum minister said Gail's Khilpara Mother Station will be the hub of City Gas Distribution Network for Gomati District and will also be helpful in creating a gas based economy in the region, thereby creating direct and indirect employment and livelihood for people of this region.

Pradhan, who is also the Union Skill Development and Entrepreneurship minister said the upcoming National Skill Training Institute for a women in Agartala will fulfil the need for skill training of women in Tripura and other North-Eastern States. Central government will bear the cost for all training materials, merit-cum-stipend and scholarship.

""Tripura is one of the fastest growing state in the country after the BJP government came to power, ONGC Tripura Asset had played a major role in this connection,"" he said.

The Petroleum minister said the Modi government is committed to provide energy justice to the poorest of the poor specially people residing in the the remotest areas of our country. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) has empowered more than 2.17 lakh women in Tripura and LPG has reached 73 per cent households in the state.

He said 150 more petrol pumps and one more LPG bottling centre would be opened in Tripura shortly and the storage capacity of petrol depot at Dharmanagar in North Tripura district would be increased.

Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb who present on the occasion said Tripura would be made a model state in terms of development as both state and the central government has a good understanding and the Centre is serious about development of Tripura which remained neglected for years.

The Tripura chief minister said the Central government has recently sanctioned Rs 2,300 crore as additional fund to the state.",534,0.7978254357973734

The government has asked state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) to sell out 66 of their small oil and gas fields to private firms as it brought in a new policy to boost domestic production and cut imports, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Thursday.

To quickly bring all sedimentary basins under oil and gas exploration, the government dumped a two-year-old model of bidding out acreage or blocks to firms offering highest share of revenue, and brought in a new system of bidding them out on the basis of work programme such as drilling of wells and shooting of seismic with the winner's only liability being payment of statutory duties like royalty and cess, he told reporters here.

ONGC and OIL, who are battling stagnation in output from largely ageing fields, have a total of 184 fields. The national oil companies have been asked to provide enhanced production profile for 66 of these fields, which contribute 95 per cent of the 36 million tonne of annual oil production in the country, and given freedom to induct private and foreign partners or technology providers.

They have been allowed to retain another 52 fields (49 by ONGC and 3 by OIL) where enhanced oil recovery or improved oil recovery programmes are already under implementation and they were put on production in the last four years.

For the remaining 66 fields (64 belonging to ONGC and 2 to OIL), which currently contribute about 5 per cent of total output, will be bid out or privatised with revenue share going to the two firms.

Giving details of the decisions taken by the Cabinet earlier this week, Pradhan said companies will be given pricing and marketing freedom for yet-to-be-developed discoveries and will levy a lesser royalty in case of state-owned firms raising production from existing fields.

Marketing and pricing freedom will be given to those new gas discoveries whose field development plan (FDP) or investment proposal is yet to be approved. This would apply to both state producers like ONGC and private ones like Reliance.

ONGC is sitting on two dozen discoveries which it had not been able to produce because of the current government-mandated price being less than the cost of production. Reliance also has discoveries in east coast block NEC-25 where it can produce after the new freedom.

An incentive to produce additional gas from APM or nomination fields of state-owned firms like ONGC and OIL will be given in form of royalty reduction at the rate of 10 per cent on additional production over and above business as usual (BAU) scenario, which will be approved by the upstream regulator, DGH.

Pradhan said the alongside, the government has decided to award future exploration acreage based on exploration work commitment, which will replace a two-year-old method of awarding them to companies offering the highest revenue share to the government.

Exploration blocks in Category-I basins, where commercial production of hydrocarbon has already been established, will be bid out on the basis of a mix of work commitment and revenue share in the ratio of 70:30, he said.

Exploration blocks in Category II and III basins will be awarded purely based on the exploration work programme, he said adding winning company's only liability would be to pay royalty and cess and there would be no profit share.

""There will be no revenue or production sharing in these contracts but the government will get a share in case of windfall gains,"" he said adding that the trigger for such a sharing has been fixed at USD 2.5 billion in a financial year from the block.

Pradhan said the focus of the new policy is to raise output from the existing fields and bring newer areas under production quickly.

""Revenue or profit is no longer the priority. Production will be,"" he said. ""Fiscal incentive is being given for early monetisation of discoveries.""

National oil companies (NOCs) have been given freedom to bid out fields and induct technology partners. ""Bidding process will be decided by the NOCs,"" he said adding the process is expected to be completed in four months.

The BJP-led NDA government had two years ago moved from production-sharing contracts, where acreage for exploration of oil and gas was allocated to firms offering the largest work programmes (such as carrying out seismic survey and drilling of wells), to revenue sharing contracts, where the firm offering highest revenue to the government was given the blocks.

In the older system, the explorer was guaranteed that his entire cost will be allowed to be recovered once commercially exploitable oil and gas is found. But in revenue sharing contract, the cost has no bearing and the companies are supposed to bid the revenue or production that they would give to the government at different levels of output and price.

The move to revenue sharing was despite several industry players stating that prospectivity in the country was poor and there was a need to give incentives to companies for exploration.

India has 26 sedimentary basins measuring 3.14 million square kilometers. These are classified into four categories: Category-I basins where commercial production has been established like Cambay, Mumbai Offshore, Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari, Cauvery, Assam Shelf and Assam-Arakan fold belt; Category-II basins with known accumulation of hydrocarbons but no commercial production so far such as Kutch, Mahanadi-NEC (North East Coast), Andaman-Nicobar and Kerala-Konkan-Lakshadweep.

The category-III basins have hydrocarbon reserves that are considered geologically prospective such as in Himalayan Foreland basin, Ganga Basin, Vindhyan basin, Saurashtra basin, Kerela Konkan basin, Bengal basin; and Category-IV which are the ones having uncertain potential which may be prospective by analogy with similar basins in the world. These include Karewa basin, Spiti-Zanskar basin, Satpura–South Rewa–Damodar basin, Chhattisgarh basin, Narmada basin, Deccan Syneclise, Bhima-Kaladgi, Bastar basin, Pranhita Godavari basin and Cuddapah basin.",978,0.277378648519516

Global brokerage house HSBC said among oil & gas stocks, state-owned ONGC and Oil India's December quarter earnings surprised positively.

Earnings growth was driven by gas production & lower costs.

Current oil prices put them in a sweet spot, the brokerage said, adding rising gas production & gas prices are expected to drive earnings growth.

Hence HSBC advised buying ONGC & Oil India with a price target at Rs 180 & Rs 215 apiece, implying 31 percent and 23 percent potential upside respectively.

Oil India's third quarter profit grew by 74.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,233 crore and revenue increased 23.2 percent to Rs 3,514 crore. At operating level, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) during the quarter rose 24.3 percent to Rs 1,521 crore and margin expanded by 37 bps.

The performance was majorly driven by a healthy uptick in natural gas and crude oil segment, even though the performance from the LPG, pipeline and renewable energy business remained largely muted.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation posted a 64.8 percent jump in third-quarter profit, boosted by higher revenue from offshore operations.

Its profit increased sharply to Rs 8,263 crore) in the quarter ended December 2018, from Rs 5,015 crore a year earlier and revenue from operations climbed over 20 percent to Rs 27,694 crore, while revenue from offshore operations rose 19.1 percent, ONGC said.

State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation is expected to report a decline in bottomline and operating income as realisation is likely to fall QoQ on lower oil prices during the quarter ended December 2018. But year-on-year, numbers are expected to be strong.

Brokerages expect profit to fall in the range of 2-24 percent sequentially but they see 25-60 percent rise in bottomline. Also, they largely expect the company not to bear any subsidy burden.

""We expect realisations to decline 11 percent QoQ at $65 a barrel due to lower crude oil prices. Hence, profit is expected to decrease 24.4 percent QoQ to Rs 6,244 crore on decline in realisations as well as lower other income,"" said ICICI Securities that does not expect any subsidy during the quarter.

According to Antique Stock Broking, the net crude realisation for ONGC in Q3FY19 is estimated at around $67-68 a barrel (versus $73-76 in Q2FY19 and around $50-61 in Q3FY18).

Motilal Oswal expects the profit at 2 percent QoQ and 61 percent YoY.

Brokerages largely expect the dip in topline of the company around 3-6 percent sequentially due to decline in oil prices and tepid oil production and sales. But YoY, the same may increase more than 17 percent.

""We estimate decline of 10 percent YoY and 1 percent QoQ in oil sales while growth of 3 percent YoY and 2 percent QoQ in gas sales during the quarter,"" said Motilal Oswal. The brokerage expects 4 percent QoQ decline and 17 percent YoY rise in revenue.

ICICI Securities said ONGC's oil and gas production is expected to witness QoQ growth of 0.4 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively. ""While oil production is estimated at 6.1 MMT, gas output is expected at 6.5 MMT in Q3FY19.""

EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) may see marginal decline sequentially but may remain strong YoY.

Motilal Oswal estimates EBITDA growth of 20 percent YoY and degrowth of 5 percent QoQ while Emkay said ONGC's EBITDA is estimated to decline slightly as higher sales versus production should support earnings.

Indian benchmark indices fell on Thursday afternoon, with the Nifty50 down 40 points and was trading at 10753 mark while the Sensex shed 103 points, trading at 35930 mark. The fall was largely aided by energy stocks after crude oil prices climbed to their highest in nearly three months.

US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.16 per barrel at 0413 GMT, up 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures were up 37 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $63.98 a barrel. China’s crude oil imports in January rose 4.8 percent from a year earlier, customs data showed on Thursday, to an average of 10.03 million barrels per day (bpd), the third straight month that imports have exceeded the 10 million bpd mark.

The global oil market will struggle this year to absorb fast-growing crude supply from outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), even with the group’s production cuts and US sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, the International Energy Agency said in a report on Wednesday.

In a boost to firms like ONGC and Reliance Industries, the government is likely to raise the price of domestically produced natural gas by over 10 percent to over $3.72 per million British thermal unit with effect from April 1, sources in know of the development said.

The price of gas produced from difficult fields will rise to about $9 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) from current $7.67, they said.

This will be the fourth straight increase in gas prices.

Natural gas prices are set every six months - on April 1 and October 1 every year - based on average rates in gas-surplus nations like the US, Russia and Canada.

The rate is calculated by taking a weighted average price at Henry Hub of the US, National Balancing Point of the UK, rates in Alberta (Canada) and Russia with a lag of one quarter.

So for April 1 to September 30, period, the average rates prevailing during January 1, 2018, to December 1, 2018, would be taken.

Sources said, the rates for 2018 are known and based on it the rise from April 1 comes to 10 percent.

The increase in price will boost earnings of producers like Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Reliance Industries but will also lead to a rise in price of CNG, which uses natural gas as input. It would also lead to higher cost of natural gas piped to households (PNG) for cooking purposes as well as of feedstock cost for manufacturing of fertilisers and petrochemicals.

The hike will boost producers like ONGC. Every dollar increase in gas price results in Rs 4,000 crore additional revenue for the PSU on an annual basis, sources said adding ONGC is the country's biggest gas producer, accounting for two-thirds of the over 70 million standard cubic meters per day current output.

The $3.72 per mmBtu price will be the highest since October 2015 to March 2016.

India imports half of its gas which costs more than double the domestic rate.

Natural gas prices were last hiked on October 1, 2018, by 10 percent when rates moved up to $3.36 per mmBtu from $3.06.

The increase will translate into a higher cap price based on alternate fuels for undeveloped gas finds in difficult areas like deep sea, which are unviable to develop as per the existing pricing formula.

The price for such fields from April 1 would be about $9 per mmBtu for six month beginning April 1 as compared to $7.67 currently, sources said.

India currently produces about 90 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) of natural gas and has ambitious plans to double output by 2022 to reduce its reliance on imports and replace some of the polluting liquid fuels to cut emissions.

Speaking on sidelines of the Petrotech conference on the outskirts of Delhi, officials said ONGC and OIL have a dozen discoveries, which are unviable at current government mandated gas price.

These finds, they said, need a higher price and the government plans for special incentives for them would help bring them to production quickly.

Oil Minister Dharmendra pradhan had last month stated ""special incentive besides the incentive already provided"" will be given to difficult fields of ONGC.

""We dont know what that incentive will be, but we presume it will be a higher and remunerative price,"" an official said.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) have not been able to develop the discoveries or bring them to production as the current gas price of USD 3.36 per million British thermal unit (MMBtu) is way lower than the cost of production.

Officials said ONGC has about 35 billion cubic meters of recoverable reserves in discoveries in the shallow sea off Andhra Pradesh on the east and off Gujarat and Mumbai on the west coast blocks.

The three blocks in Krishna Godavari basin, Gulf of Kutch and Mumbai offshore can produce about 10 mmscmd of gas and an equivalent amount can be produced from its onshore discoveries in blocks like Bantumili, Mandapeta and Bhuvanagiri, they said.

About 5 mmscmd of production can be added by making some investment in existing fields like Mumbai High South, Neelam and B-127 Cluster in the Arabian Sea.

Oil India Ltd (OIL) has an onland discovery in the Krishna Godavari basin in Andhra Pradesh with over 3 billion cubic meters of recoverable reserves, but needs a higher price to bring it to production.

The officials said all these fields can be expeditiously developed and monetised in case pricing and marketing freedom is granted by the government.

ONGC and OIL want a price of over $6 per MMBtu to help them produce the gas without suffering any losses.

In the absence of a viable gas price, they will have to mothball $3 billion projects, the officials said.

The BJP-led government had in October 2014, evolved a new pricing formula using rates prevalent in gas surplus nations like US, Canada and Russia to determine price in a net importing country.

Prices using this formula are calculated semi-annually. While the government has allowed a higher rate of $7.67 per mmBtu for gas fields in difficult areas like the deep sea, ONGC's Krishna Godavari basin block KG-OSN-2004/1, which has about 15 bcm of recoverable reserves, is in shallow waters and does not qualify as a 'difficult field'.

Similar is the fate of Mumbai basin block MB-OSN-2005/1 on the western side. The block GK-28/42 in Gulf of Kutch is a nomination block which does not qualify for higher rates, they said.

The onland discoveries of ONGC and OIL too do not qualify for the higher rates. While ONGC's KG block can produce a peak output of 5 mmscmd, the same from GK-28/42 is expected to be around 2.5 mmscmd. Peak output from MB-OSN-2005/1 is expected to a little less than 3 mmscmd.

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on March 20, 2017, had stated that the cost of production of natural gas in the prolific Krishna Godavari basin is between $4.99 to $7.30 per mmBtu.

The same for other basins is in the range of $3.80 to $6.59 per mmBtu, he had said, adding the production cost of companies vary from field to field depending upon the size of the reservoir, location, logistics and availability of surface facilities.",685,0.9832890331745148

As many as 39 firms, including six foreign players, on Wednesday put in 145 bids for 24 out of the 25 oil and gas fields on offer in the second round of bidding for discovered small fields in India, with mining giant Vedanta placing offer for the maximum 21 fields.

At the close of bidding for the second round of Discovered Small Fields (DSF), state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) placed bids for 10 fields each while Indian Oil Corp (IOC) bid for 3, according to upstream regulator DGH.

British company Soco International made its foray into India, bidding for one field while little known Arch Softwares put in bids for 15 fields.

Vedanta, which had walked away with 41 exploration blocks of the 55 on offer in a separate open acreage licensing round last year, bid for 21 fields in DSF-II. It was the sole bidder in one field.

The 25 contract areas on offer covered 59 discovered oil and gas fields, spread over 3,000 square kilometers with a prospective resource base of over 190 million tonne (MT) of oil and oil equivalent gas, DGH said in a statement.

""Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) received 145 e-bids for 24 out of 25 contract areas under the DSF Bid Round-II by the deadline of 1200 Hours on January 30, 2019,"" it said.

Out of the total 145 e-bids received, 103 were received for onland contract areas and 42 for offshore contract areas.

""As many as 39 companies (individually or as a member of the bidding consortium) have participated in the bid round. The response to the DSF Bid Round-II has been overwhelming as compared to the last round of DSF in 2016. Out of 25 contract areas on offer, 15 are onland and 10 are in shallow offshore areas,"" DGH said.

All the 15 onland contract areas received bids while 9 out of 10 offshore contract areas have received bids.

""Six foreign companies have also submitted the bids. This bid round saw more than anticipated participation from new entrants from India and foreign countries like the US, UK, Australia, Singapore and the UAE,"" it said without giving details.

The fields would be awarded by end of February 2019, so as to expedite the monetisation of the hydrocarbon production from these fields, it said.

In 2016, the government brought in a new DSF policy wherein 'idle' small discovered fields of ONGC and Oil India were taken away from them and auctioned to private players on liberalised terms including marketing and pricing freedom and lower taxes.

ONGC and OIL say they have not been able to develop the fields due to their small size, and the current capped prices are making their development unviable. Private companies will, however, get full pricing and marketing freedom.

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had last month told Parliament that ONGC had spent Rs 12,826 crore and OIL another Rs 224.27 crore on the 115 oil and gas discoveries that were taken away from them by the government for auctioning to private companies under DSF bid rounds.

Under the DSF bid round-I in 2017, 67 discoveries were mostly of ONGC.

ONGC and OIL are not compensated for the amount they had spent on discoveries of these oil and gas reserves. Unlike state-owned firms, the private players are allowed pricing and marketing freedom to make these discoveries viable. The two PSUs have previously stated that they could not produce from the discoveries as they are uneconomically at current cap prices.

The 67 discoveries under the DSF bid round-I are estimated to have in place reserves of 86 MT of oil and gas equivalent.

In the DSF round-I, a total of 134 bids were received for 34 blocks out of 46 on offer.

""The production from areas offered in DSF-I is likely to start as per contract timelines in 2019-20 and now DSF-II areas follow, as a continuum, to add up to the domestic production and increasing the numbers of oil and gas operators in the country,"" DGH said in the statement.

DGH officials said the main features of DSF-II include a single licence for exploitation of both conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon, prior technical experience not a pre-qualification criterion, no upfront signature bonus and full pricing and marketing freedom. Royalty rates have been reduced to 7.5 per cent from 10 per cent for offshore blocks.",741,0.8835016489028931

Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd's (HPCL) Rs 43,129-crore refinery project in Barmer district of Rajasthan has achieved financial closure with tying up of a Rs 28,753-crore loan from a consortium of lenders, the company said on Monday.

HPCL, a subsidiary of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), signed a debt syndication agreement with the consortium of nine lenders led by State Bank of India, a company statement said.

""SBI is the lead lender with more than 50 per cent share in the consortium,"" it said. ""This is one of the largest project debt syndications in India.""

The project, where HPCL owns 74 per cent stake and the balance is held by the Rajasthan government, will cost Rs 43,129 crore. Two-thirds of the project cost is being funded through loans and the remaining through equity by promoters.

It comprises a 9-million tonne a year oil refinery and a 2-million tonne per annum petrochemicals unit.

SBI Caps was the debt arranger, it added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 16, 2018, started work on the project that will be completed by 2022-23.

Originally, then Congress president Sonia Gandhi had laid foundation stone of the refinery on September 22, 2013.

The state government is giving Rs 1,123 crore per annum for 15 years as an interest-free loan instead of previously envisaged tax breaks. This has resulted in reducing the financial burden on the state government from Rs 56,040 crore to Rs 16,845 crore.

ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker, in his speech after hoisting the national flag at the company headquarters at Dehradun, said the vision document 'Strategic Roadmap 2040' would craft the strategy for the firm as an integrated energy major with a long-term perspective.

""The document would reframe the vision and recast the objectives of Perspective Plan 2030,"" he said.

The Perspective Plan 2030 was ONGC's earlier vision document that outlined strategic goals for the growth of the organisation and for the energy security of the nation, a company statement said.

""Our portfolio has seen a metamorphic change in the last decade. Today our business portfolio includes E&P, refining, petrochemicals, LNG, pipelines, retail, SEZ Infrastructure, power etc. While these developments open up new vistas and opportunities for the company, they also add layers of complexity to our decision-making and strategic framework,"" he said.

Shanker said ONGC is considering many opportunities for sustaining growth and fulfilling its vision of becoming a global energy leader. The exercise also envisages evaluating potential growth areas, both within and outside India, so that ONGC is able to prioritise suitable actions well in advance. ?

Overall, FY18 was a solid year for ONGC, he said. ""Our standalone hydrocarbon production increased year on year; the uptick in gas output was particularly impressive. Crude oil output increased marginally from FY17 levels while gas output increased by over 6 per cent to 23.5 BCM from 22.0 BCM in FY17.""

Shanker also expressed satisfaction with the performance of the company's subsidiaries. Overseas production recorded another strong year of growth. Oil plus oil equivalent gas output increased to over 14 million tonnes in FY18 against 12.80 million tonnes a year back.",314,0.9571605920791626

The public sector companies, especially public sector banks, had a roller-coster ride in 2018, but now CLSA has said that investors should not ignore PSUs in 2019 as the risk-to-reward ratio is looking fairly attractive.

The state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are trading close to all-time lows at a forward PE of 8.8x. Valuations, when compared to Nifty, appear even more compelling at a 50 percent discount, said the note.

CLSA is betting on ONGC, NTPC and Coal India among non-finance PSUs, and among financials, it prefers SBI.

According to CLSA, slowing domestic flows is a risk and it can lead to market de-rating. A similar view was shared by UBS in a report released earlier this week.

“Benign liquidity has supported India’s premium valuations and increased local flows into the equity market. Although liquidity has started to normalise post the tight phase in H2 2018, easy money of the past three years is unlikely to be back in a hurry,” said the UBS report.

“Historical returns have supported retail flows historically, and this too, is now less of support. UBS-Financial Conditions Index also suggests waning support for flows and returns,” it added.

The global investment bank has given a target of 10,000 for Nifty in its base case scenario which translates into a fall of 8 percent from Tuesday’s closing of 10,886.

“Our base case Nifty target for 2019-end is 10,000, implying a downside of 7 percent, while our upside/downside scenarios also suggest unattractive risk-to-reward,” said the report. While GDP growth may recover a bit, political and policy uncertainty keeps us cautious, it highlighted.

The global investment bank is overweight IT, private banks and property. It remains underweight on industrials/infrastructure and small and midcaps.

UBS further said that it has more neutral/underweight sectors than overweight, similar to 2018. It recommends investors to take more stock-specific calls rather than sector-specific calls.

Budget Expectations:

CLSA in a report highlighted that the pressure to expand the farmer welfare programme ahead of the 2019 national elections is high for PM Modi. A possible announcement of a nationwide direct farmer support scheme is quite likely in the Budget on February 1, or possibly even earlier.

A Telangana-style scheme could cost Rs 1.2 trillion, further complicating fiscal math, as it could be a recurring liability. The RBI’s possible large dividend might help just one time.

The GST-led tax revenue shortfall of 75-80bps of GDP is not reflected in the reduced govt expenditure for FY19 due to off-balancesheet funding, which is not a sustainable solution and will create its own problems later and distort the reported fiscal deficit for FY19.

“We expect the ‘real’ govt expenditure growth to slow down. The impact on capex will be even greater if the farmer support scheme is implemented. ITC should see some relief rally, as the budget is unlikely to tinker with tobacco taxation,” added the report.",486,-0.2873828858137131

Hunting for fresh ideas in volatile market might be tricky, but taking a sneak peek in a portfolio of mutual fund houses might be of some help.

Mutual fund (MF) industry's assets declined to Rs 22.8 lakh crore in December 2018 from Rs 23.4 lakh core in November 2018 on the back of moderation in the flows into equity funds and outflows from liquid funds.

However, assets under management (AUM) were up 5.5 percent for CY18, primarily led by inflows in the liquid, equities, other ETF and balanced categories. Equity mutual funds attracted steady flows, largely due to the participation through systematic investment plans (SIPs).

Inflows into equity funds (including equity-linked saving schemes) declined 21 percent on a month-on-month (MoM) basis to Rs 6,606 crore in December, but flow into systematic investment plans (SIPs) soared to record highs.

SIP inflows remained strong and crossed Rs 8,000 crore for the first time in December 2018, ICICIDirect said in a report. However, the growth in number of SIP additions has slowed down significantly, but in no way, it suggests that retail investors are losing confidence.

Retail flows have been resilient in recent years, which truly speaks volumes of our domestic strength. These inflows have credibly helped fight volatility at times when FIIs were on a selling spree, suggest experts.

“Technology has played a vital role as many SIPs are on auto debit mode from bank accounts. My sense is that retail flows will continue to flow into equities in a disciplined manner,” Amar Ambani, President & Head of Research at YES Securities told Moneycontrol.

“It would take over 10 percent downside from current market levels followed by a lackluster market for a prolonged period for the auto debit SIPs to be turned off. That seems highly unlikely,” he said.

The year saw a notable change in the sector and stock allocation of funds. The weight of defensives increased from 24.3 percent in CY17 to 27.6 percent in CY18. Global Cyclicals’ weight, too, increased 50 bps to 10.7 percent, Motilal Oswal said in a report.

In December 2018, MFs showed interest in utilities, oil & gas, banks and capital goods. These sectors saw a MoM increase in weight. On the other hand, technology, automobiles, healthcare, metals, consumer, telecom and cement saw a MoM decrease in weight, added the report.

Here's what mutual fund managers bought and sold in December quarter:

ONGC, Coal India, IOC, Bharat Electronics, and NTPC witnessed highest buying interest in the largecap space during December 2018.

In midcaps, stocks like Oil India, NBCC, SJVNL, Reliance Infrastructure, and REC witnessed highest buying during December 2018.

In smallcaps, JK Cement, CDSL, Healthcare Global, SH Kelkar, and Sanghi Industries found favour among fund managers.

Top stocks which fund managers sold in December:

In the largecap space, selling by AMCs were seen in Indiabulls Housing, Bosch, SAIL, Godrej Consumer and Biocon.

Midcap stocks which saw selling by AMCs were Gillette India, Glaxo Pharma, IDBI Bank, Pfizer and Bayer CropScience.

Small cap stocks that saw selling were Aster DM Healthcare, Jet Airways, ICRA, Shoppers Stop and Johnson Controls - Hitachi Air Conditioning India.

Note: Investors should ideally follow their own research before putting their money and at best the below list could be taken as a reference point to shortlist stocks. It could turn out to be a relatively risky strategy for retail investors if they follow what fund managers buy or sell because the objective, holding period and exposure in the portfolio could be totally different.",607,-0.026482116092335094

Speaking at the launch of second bid round for 14 exploration blocks under open acreage licensing policy, Pradhan said Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and OIL will have the freedom to decide which of their currently producing fields they want to retain and in the ones where they would like to induct a partner.

This is a climb down from the 2017 position where the oil ministry's upstream technical advisory body Directorate General of Hydrocarbons identified 15 fields -- 11 of ONGC and four of OIL -- for giving out 60 per cent stake to foreign and private companies. The move couldn't go through because of tough resistance from the state-owned firms.

Then again in October last year, the ministry wanted ONGC to concentrate on large fields as they contribute to 95 per cent of its production and leave out the rest for private firms.

""They can decide on the fields they want to retain and the stake they want to give (to foreign and private firms),"" he said.

Pradhan said ""special incentive besides the incentive already provided"" will be given to difficult fields of ONGC.

""Previously, the government objective was revenue maximisation but now enhancing production is the only motive,"" he said.

He, however, did not elaborate on the special incentive. Natural gas discoveries in difficult areas like deepsea currently command a higher price but this is applicable only for future finds and not currently discoveries of ONGC.

ONGC and OIL haven't been able to develop some of their discoveries or bring them to production as the current gas price of USD 3.36 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) is way lower than the cost of production.

ONGC has about 35 billion cubic metres of recoverable reserves in discoveries in the shallow sea off Andhra Pradesh on the east and off Gujarat and Mumbai on the west coast blocks.

The three blocks in Krishna Godavari basin, Gulf of Kutch and Mumbai offshore can produce about 10 mmscmd of gas and an equivalent amount can be produced from its onshore discoveries in blocks like Bantumili, Mandapeta and Bhuvanagiri.

About 5 mmscmd of production can be added by making some investment in existing fields like Mumbai High South, Neelam and B-127 Cluster in the Arabian Sea.

Oil India has an onland discovery in the Krishna Godavari basin in Andhra Pradesh with over 3 billion cubic metres of recoverable reserves but needs a higher price to bring it to production.

Pradhan said ONGC and OIL will soon come out with production enhancement contracts (PECs) wherein foreign or private companies will be allowed to take a stake in identified currently producing fields in return for raising output beyond an agreed level.

The state-owned firms, he said, would device the contracts and implement them.

""They will be given autonomy and freedom but will have greater accountability,"" he said.

In October 2017, the DGH had identified 15 producing fields with a combined reserve of 791.2 million tonne crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas of national oil companies for handing over to private firms in the hope they would improve upon the baseline estimate and their extraction.

The plan, however, could not go through as ONGC strongly countered the DGH proposal with its own proposal that it be allowed to outsource operations on the same terms as the government plan, which involved pricing and marketing freedom.

The fields identified in 2017 Kalol, Ankleshwar, Gandhar and Santhal -- the big four oil fields of ONGC in Gujarat.

The DGH also had identified 44 other fields of ONGC and OIL which could take on partners for production enhancement work where bidders would get the 'tariff' that they bid as a return for increasing the output 'over the baseline production' for an initial period of 10 years.

The oil ministry has been unhappy with the near stagnant oil and gas production and believes giving out the discovered fields to private firms would help raise output as they can bring in technology and capital.",710,0.9794948895772299

We have some big numbers here.

This is, in fact, the summary of the borrowings of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) during FY17-18. In FY16-17 they had no borrowings. In fact, during the previous several years they had zero borrowings. This is a cash-rich company because that's what a Big Oil company is.

But now, they not only have slimmed their coffers but also picked up loans, like people pick-up vegetables during a discount rush. And all that because of some ill-considered decisions taken by our present Central government regarding this PSU company.

The reason ONGC took on debt was for purchasing Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) from the government. The government owns both ONGC and HPCL, but it needed money, so it forced ONGC to buy its ownership of HPCL for a whopping Rs 36,000 crore, for which ONGC borrowed about Rs 24,000 crore.

But ONGC is hugely cash-flow positive, and in the first six months after this report, it reduced its debt to just Rs 14,000 crore.

The reason for pointing this sticky situation out is that the Central government recently directed cash-rich state-run companies that have a lot of idle capital, to utilise it by handing out dividends and carrying out buybacks. Why? Because they need to meet their Rs 80,000 crore divestment target.

That means that even ONGC (even after buying HPCL) has to roll out dividends and buybacks. However, considering its current position, ONGC says it can either do a buyback or pay dividends, or better, neither, until the next financial year.

While they are still pleading the Ministry of Finance to exempt dividend, unfortunately, due to pressures from the government, they have agreed to carry out the buyback. The buyback is for 2.34 percent of its shareholders' capital, which comes to Rs 4,022 crore. The record date set for both is January 4.

Now the question is how is ONGC going to pull this off? Answer: It can't and it doesn't have the cash anymore. Not unless ONGC picks up more loans, or reduces its efforts to pay back the loans it currently has.

Can ONGC get cash elsewhere?First, they can look at the profits that would be generated in Q3 and Q4. They generate a cash profit of over Rs 5,000 crore almost each quarter.

Secondly, ONGC holds around 134 crore shares in IOC and IOC recently declared dividends and buyback. If you look at only the dividend aspect, IOC will pay Rs 6.75 per share. For ONGC that means around Rs 903 crore. Then there's the buyback as well.

The IOC buyback is for about 3 percent of its shares at Rs 149. Assuming ONGC sells back 3 percent of its holding to IOC, that's 3 percent of 134 crore shares or 4 crore shares at Rs 149. This is about Rs 600 crore.

Finally, ONGC has received $32 million from PDVSA, as part settlement of outstanding dividend payments (ONGC owns 40 percent stake in Venezuela's San Cristobal project). Assuming $1 = Rs 70, this comes to Rs 224 crore.

So, they get about Rs 1,700 crore from dividends/buybacks of their holdings. That provides them with about 40 percent of what they need for the buyback, and the rest (of the Rs 4,022 crore) will have to be sequestered from their profits of the two quarters.

Their goal of being debt free may have to wait. They were supposed to pay back the entire loan they took to buy HPCL within a year. But that may extend another six months if it has to do this buyback and pay a dividend.

All in all ONGC seems to be in a tough (but not impossible) situation. They generate enough cash to be able to pull it off.

The problem, however, is that the government as the primary shareholder gets in the way of efficient functioning. We could analyse this and say ONGC has the money for now, but what if the greedy government keeps wanting more? As a shareholder, this might not be exciting.

It also tells you the perils of investing in a government-owned company, but at least they siphon off the money after telling you about it. In most other companies, you don't even get to know about how much money’s been looted.

Indian Oil Corporation, ONGC and NTPC emerged as the top three most profitable PSUs in 2017-18, while BSNL, Air India and MTNL incurred the highest losses for the second consecutive year, according to a survey tabled in Parliament on Thursday.

The Public Enterprises Survey 2017-18, which mapped the performance of central public sector units, revealed that the top ten loss making PSUs claimed 84.71 per cent of the total losses made by all the 71 CPSEs.

The three star performers, including Indian Oil Corporation, Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and NTPC, contributed 13.37 per cent, 12.49 per cent and 6.48 per cent, respectively to the total profit earned by CPSEs during 2017-18, the survey revealed.

Coal India and Power Grid Corporation occupied the fourth and fifth spot in the list of top 10 profit making CPSEs (Central Public Sector Enterprises) in the 2017-18 fiscal.

The three worst performing PSUs, including BSNL, Air India and MTNL, contributed 52.15 per cent of the total loss incurred by CPSEs in 2017-18.

On the other hand, Power Finance Corporation entered into the list of the top ten profit making CPSEs, while Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd has not featured in the latest list.

The top ten profit making CPSEs accounted for 61.83 per cent of the total profit earned by all the 184 profit making state-owned firms during the year.

Bharat Coking Coal Limited incurred huge losses in 2017-18 and has entered into the list of top ten loss making CPSEs, while India Infrastructure Finance Co and Eastern Coalfields, which were profit making PSUs till 2016-17, have started making losses and featured in the list of top ten loss making state-owned firms during 2017-18.",291,-0.32463695605595905

The board of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) on December 21 considered the government demand for listing its profitable overseas investment arm ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL).

The board deliberated on the demand from the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) for the listing of OVL but felt that the market conditions are not right for an oil and gas exploration and production company to list, they said, adding that there were several complexities involved in getting the firm listed.

OVL, sources said, has assets in countries like Venezuela, Iran, and Sudan, which are exposed to some or other Western sanctions.

These assets will have to be first separated from the company. While this may not be a difficult task, it would involve issues of capital gains and tax thereon, they said.

Also, OVL is heavily under debt and such a move would require taking approval of all the lenders -- yet another tedious job.

A third of its USD 28.45 billion (Rs 1.51 lakh crore) investment in 41 projects in 20 countries has been financed by loans.

More importantly, OVL has been only in acquisition mode till now and has not yet reached an economic model where it can stand on its own feet. The company is dependent on its parent for even guarantees for taking loans.

OVL has great assets and it would reach that economic model once couple of its assets like the giant gas field in Mozambique starts production, they said.

OVL projects are in the development stage and an IPO will get the best value when these projects are monetised, they said.

OVL's giant gas field in Mozambique will start production sometime in 2022 when two LNG trains of 12 million tonnes per annum capacity are set up and gas exported in cryogenic ships.

Its Farzad-B gas field in Iran is on hold in view of US sanctions on the Persian Gulf nation. Also, its Venezuelan oilfields are producing much less than their potential.

According to a letter DIPAM wrote to ONGC management in August, the listing of OVL would help unlock value by improving its corporate governance and efficiency.

ONGC had helped the government meet its disinvestment target last fiscal when it bought a 51.11 per cent stake in state-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,915 crore.

After failing to find a buyer for Air India, DIPAM is again looking at ONGC to meet the Rs 80,000 crore revenue mobilisation target set out for it in the Budget for 2018-19 from the sale of government stake in PSUs.

In the letter, DIPAM said PSUs with a positive net worth and no accumulated losses should be listed to unlock value.

It, however, did not state how much stake in OVL should be sold for its listing.

Market regulator Sebi calls for a minimum 25 per cent public float for a listed company.

Sources said proceeds of a potential listing of OVL would accrue to its parent ONGC but the government would seek a special dividend to reap that.

The government owns 67.45 per cent in ONGC. If ONGC were to declare entire proceeds of OVL listing as a special dividend, the government would get 67.45 per cent of the amount.

The government had in 2015 as well asked ONGC to list OVL. But the state-owned firm had at that time told the government that it was not the right time to list as oil prices were subdued and the company would not get the right value.

Oil prices have since rebounded and the government is looking to cash in on that.

Under its portfolio, OVL has reserves of 711 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent natural gas.

In 2017-18, it produced 9.35 million tonnes of crude oil, up from 8.43 million tonnes in the previous year. Together with natural gas, the output was 14.16 million tonnes of oil equivalent, up from 12.80 million tonnes in the previous year.

It reported a net profit of Rs 981 crore on a turnover of Rs 10,418 crore in 2017-18 fiscal. This compared with a net profit of Rs 701 crore on a turnover of Rs 10,080 crore in the previous fiscal.

The Board of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) on Thursday approved buyback of 25.29 crore shares for Rs 4,022 crore as part of the government plan to get cash-rich PSUs to part with their surplus.

The government, which holds 65.64 percent stake in the company, stands to gain about Rs 2,640 crore from tendering some of its shares in the buyback programme.

In a regulatory filing, ONGC said its board of directors approved ""buyback of equity shares of the company not exceeding 25.29 crore being 1.97 percent of the total paid-up equity shares of the company at the price of Rs 159 per equity share payable in cash for an aggregate consideration not exceeding Rs 4,022 crore"".

This follows government pushing cash-rich PSUs to use their funds to buy back shares or pay a higher dividend. The government is looking to bridge budgetary deficit through higher receipts of dividend as well as selling its shares in PSUs in the buyback programmes.

ONGC will, however, not pay an interim dividend for now as it is left with almost no surplus after accounting for its capital expenditure, sources with knowledge of the development said.

ONGC shares closed almost flat at Rs 148.65 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Thursday.

Stock buybacks refer to the repurchasing of shares by the company that issued them. A buyback occurs when the issuing company pays shareholders the market value per share and re-absorbs that portion of its ownership that was previously distributed among public and private investors.

Earlier this month, state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) said it will buy back 29.76 crore shares for about Rs 4,435 crore and spend another Rs 6,556 crore on paying an interim dividend to shareholders.

The board of the country's largest oil firm, IOC approved buyback of up to 29.76 crore equity shares, or 3.06 percent, at Rs 149 per share.

Besides ONGC and IOC, at least half a dozen other central PSUs have disclosed share buyback programmes. Prominent among these include NHPC, Coal India, Oil India Ltd, BHEL, NALCO, NLC, Cochin Shipyard, and KIOCL.

The government is expected to participate in each of the share buyback programme of these PSUs with anticipation of netting over Rs 5,000 crore.

IOC had also declared an interim dividend of 67.5 percent or Rs 6.75 per share for fiscal 2018-19. The total dividend payout, excluding tax, would be Rs 6,556 crore, of which the government will get Rs 3,544 crore plus the dividend distribution tax.

Last month, Oil India Ltd announced a buyback of 5.04 crore of its share for a little over Rs 1,085 crore.

The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which has been set a target to raise Rs 80,000 crore for the government through stake sale in central public sector enterprises, had prodded all cash-rich PSUs to go for share buybacks.

PSUs having a net worth of at least Rs 2,000 crore and a cash balance of more than Rs 1,000 crore have to mandatorily go in for share buyback.",515,

- ONGC may consider listing of OVL, its international arm

- Under pressure from government to buyback shares

- Listing to potentially unlock value, though concerns over timing- Buyback to tighten capex plans

-------------------------------------------------

State-run resource firm ONGC is holding a meeting today, where, according to media reports, it may take a call on undertaking a buyback and/or issuing a dividend. Also said to be on the agenda is the listing of its wholly-owned subsidiary ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL).

The government has pressured ONGC to buy back shares, as the move will help bridge the fiscal deficit. According to reports, the company may issue a buyback to the tune of Rs 4,800 crore.

While the company has wherewithal to fund such a buyback – it had cash and liquid investments to the tune of Rs 11,428 crore as of March 31, 2018 – the hefty buyback amount could tighten the company’s planned capex.

An OVL listing will not only help raise funds for the buyback but also unlock value. OVL, whose reserves amount to 15 percent of ONGC’s total reserves, does not disclose detailed numbers separately. A listing will make disclosures better. Valuations for the company are arrived at based on estimates reserves of OVL.

But a listing for the company is not without its challenges. Analysts argue the recent sharp fall in crude prices has made an unfavourable time to list OVL, and that crude price above $8o would have been a better time.

Moreover, ONGC might also have to segregate the overseas assets of OVL and this might attract transaction costs and tax expenses which would be an added burden for ONGC.

The crude price fall has also raised concerns about the impact on ONGC’s revenues. The company management has argued that the current fall is not much of a concern for the company in the current year, as the average crude price for the year still remains above $ 65 per barrel. But sustained lower levels of crude might hamper the company’s top line and profits in the coming year.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) spent over Rs 13,000 crore on 115 oil and gas discoveries which were taken away from them by the government for auctioning to private companies, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday.

The present BJP-led NDA government took away so-called idle small and marginal discoveries of ONGC and OIL and auctioned them to private firms under Discovered Small Field (DSF) bid rounds.

Under DSF bid round-1, 67 discoveries, mostly of ONGC, were auctioned, while in the second round, bids for which are due next month, another 48 finds are being auctioned, he said in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha.

""As informed by ONGC, an amount of Rs 12,826 crore has been spent by ONGC on the discoveries/fields identified in the first and second round of Discovered Small Field Policy. An amount of Rs 224.27 crore has been spent by OIL in this regard,"" he said.

ONGC and OIL are not compensated for the amount they had spent on discoveries of these oil and gas reserves. Unlike state-owned firms, the private players are allowed pricing and marketing freedom to make these discoveries viable. ONGC and OIL have stated that they could not produce from the discoveries as they are uneconomically at current cap prices.

""With a view to increasing domestic production of oil and gas, the government in May 2016 launched Discovered Small Field Bid Round-I under which 67 discoveries of ONGC and OIL, which had not been put into production, were offered for auction through international competitive bidding,"" Pradhan said. ""The policy has now been extended to its second round to include 48 un-monetised discoveries of ONGC and OIL under DSF Bid Round-II.""

Under DSF-I, 47 companies participated in the bidding process, he said.

ONGC and OIL were also allowed to participate in the auction to get back their own discoveries.

""The 67 discoveries under DSF Bid Round-1 are estimated to have in place reserves of 86 million tonne of oil and gas equivalent. In DSF-II, 48 discoveries of ONGC/OIL offered for bid are estimated to have in place reserves of 163.08 million tonne of oil and gas equivalent,"" he said.

Pradhan said the government has notified the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) on March 30, 2016, which is based on revenue sharing model wherein explorers offering a higher share of oil and gas to the government are awarded blocks.

The salient feature of HELP include single license for exploration and production of conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons like shale oil, he said adding also included in HELP is an Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) wherein investors can carve out the area of their interest for exploration and production of oil and gas and submit expression of interest throughout the year.

HELP has easy to administer revenue sharing model and marketing and pricing freedom for crude oil and natural gas has been guaranteed for operators, he said.",504,

The official said there would be a need to rebalance the ETF after the third tranche as the government holding in certain CPSEs in the basket could fall below 53 per cent.

Stock buybacks refer to the repurchasing of shares by the company that issued them. A buyback occurs when the issuing company pays shareholders the market value per share and re-absorbs that portion of its ownership that was previously distributed among public and private investors.

In a regulatory filing, ONGC said: ""The meeting of Board of Directors of the company will be held on Thursday, December 20, 2018, inter-alia, to consider the proposal for buy-back of the fully paid-up equity shares of the company.""

The government holds 67.48 per cent stake in India's largest oil and gas producer ONGC.

Just on Thursday, state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) said it will buy back 29.76 crore shares for about Rs 4,435 crore and spend another Rs 6,556 crore on paying an interim dividend to shareholders.

The board of the country's largest oil firm Thursday approved buyback of up to 29.76 crore equity shares, or 3.06 per cent, at Rs 149 per share.

The government, which holds a 54.06 per cent stake in the company, is expected to participate in the share buyback.

The government is targeting a minimum Rs 5,000 crore through share buyback offers of state-owned firms like Coal India, BHEL and Oil India Ltd.

Besides IOC, at least half a dozen other central PSUs have disclosed share buyback programmes. Prominent among these include NHPC, BHEL, NALCO, NLC, Cochin Shipyard and KIOCL that could fetch the government a little over Rs 3,000 crore.

The government is expected to participate in each of the share buyback programme of these PSUs.

IOC had also stated that its board has declared an interim dividend of 67.5 per cent or Rs 6.75 per share for fiscal 2018-19.

The total dividend payout, excluding tax, would be Rs 6,556 crore, of which the government will get Rs 3,544 crore plus the dividend distribution tax.

Last month, Oil India Ltd announced a buyback of 5.04 crore of its share for a little over Rs 1,085 crore.

The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which has been set a target to raise Rs 80,000 crore for the government through stake sale in central public sector enterprises, had prodded all cash-rich PSUs to go for share buybacks.

PSUs having a net worth of at least Rs 2,000 crore and a cash balance of more than Rs 1,000 crore have to mandatorily go in for share buyback.",508,

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation shares rallied 5 percent ahead of board meeting to consider share buyback proposal next week.

""....the board meeting is scheduled on December 20 to consider the proposal for buyback of the fully paid-up equity shares of the company,"" the country's largest oil & gas exploration company said.

Hence, trading window will remain closed for the designated persons from December 17 to, 24, 2018, it added.

The Government of India held 67.48 percent shareholding in ONGC as of September 2018.

It is the second company from PSU oil & gas space to announce buyback of shares after IOC.

On December 13, state-run fuel retailer Indian Oil Corporation said it would buy back 29.76 crore shares (representing 3.06 percent of total paid-up equity) for about Rs 4,435 crore and spend another Rs 6,556 crore on paying an interim dividend to shareholders.

The government had on previous occasions looked at hiving off the highly successful OVL from its parent and monetising it by listing the firm on domestic or international bourses.

Sources said at the meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review the oil and gas sector on October 12, the Oil Ministry was asked to prepare an in-house white paper on OVL looking into various issues, including reasons for its establishment, cost incurred and returns till date.

Also, the whitepaper was to look at future strategy of OVL so as to maximise returns and issues related to equity oil (the proportion of production that a concession owner has the legal right to retain).

OVL, which is 100 per cent owned by ONGC, has so far invested Rs 1.5 lakh crore ($28.36 billion) in 41 projects across 20 countries. It has under its portfolio reserves of 711 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent natural gas.

Sources said at the October 12 meeting, which was also attended by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, a six-member panel headed by NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar was set up to look at ways of enhancing output from the existing 66 oilfields that produce about 95 per cent of domestic crude, including by giving out stake to private and foreign companies.

The committee, which also comprises Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, Oil Secretary M M Kutty, Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg and ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker, would also look at models like outright sale for the remaining 149 oilfields that produce about 5 per cent of domestic crude oil, they said.

At the meeting, Kutty gave a presentation on the status of oil and gas exploration and production in India.

It was suggested at the meeting that the 149 smaller fields could be given out to private and foreign firms and ONGC could concentrate on the big ones where it could rope in technology partners through production enhancement contracts (PEC) or technical service arrangements.

This is the second attempt of by the Oil Ministry to take away some of the fields of state-owned ONGC for giving to private and foreign companies.

In October last year, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had identified 15 producing fields with collective reserves of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas of national oil companies for handing over to private firms in the hope they would improve upon the baseline estimate and extraction.

The plan, however, could not go through as ONGC strongly countered the DGH proposal with its own proposal that it be allowed to outsource operations on same terms as the government plan.

The government is giving pricing and marketing freedom to private operators while ONGC is forced to sell natural gas at rates that are well below cost.

Sources said a few months back the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) had written to ONGC management seeking listing of OVL to help unlock value by improving its corporate governance and efficiency.

ONGC had helped the government meet its disinvestment target last fiscal when it bought a 51.11 percent stake in state-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,915 crore.

After failing to find a buyer for Air India, DIPAM was looking at ONGC to meet the Rs 80,000 crore revenue mobilisation target set out for it in the Budget for 2018-19 from the sale of government stake in PSUs.

In the letter, DIPAM said PSUs with a positive network and no accumulated losses should be listed to unlock value. It, however, did not state how much stake in OVL should be sold for its listing.

Market regulator Sebi calls for a minimum 25 percent public float for a listed company.

Sources said proceeds of the listing of OVL would accrue to its parent ONGC but the government would seek a special dividend to reap that.

The government owns 67.45 per cent stake in ONGC. If ONGC were to declare entire proceeds of OVL listing as a special dividend, the government would get 67.45 per cent of the amount.

The government had in 2015 as well asked ONGC to list OVL. But the state-owned firm had at that time told the government that it was not the right time to list as oil prices were subdued and the company would not get the right value.

Oil prices have since rebounded and the government is looking to cash in on that.

In 2017-18, OVL produced 9.35 million tonnes of crude oil, up from 8.43 million tonnes in the previous year. Together with natural gas, the output was 14.16 million tonnes of oil equivalent, up from 12.80 million tonnes in the previous year.

It reported a net profit of Rs 981 crore on a turnover of Rs 10,418 crore in 2017-18 fiscal. This compared with a net profit of Rs 701 crore on a turnover of Rs 10,080 crore in the previous fiscal.

The panel is headed by NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar and includes Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha, Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg, Oil Secretary M M Kutty, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant and ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker.

Sources said the committee is a follow up of the October 12 meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review domestic production profile of oil and gas and the roadmap for cutting import dependence by 10 per cent by 2022.

At the meeting, the Oil Ministry made a presentation showing that 149 smaller fields of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Oil India Ltd (OIL) and other explorers accounted for just 5 per cent of the domestic crude oil production.

It was suggested at the meeting that these smaller fields could be given out to private and foreign firms and ONGC could concentrate on the big ones where it could rope in technology partners through production enhancement contracts (PEC) or technical service arrangements.

Sources said the ministry was of the view that ONGC should concentrate on the large fields as they contribute to 95 per cent of its production and leave out the rest for private firms.

On the anvil is some kind of extended version of the Discovered Small Field (DSF) bid round where discovered and producing fields of ONGC are auctioned to firms offering the maximum share of output to the government, sources said.

The six-member panel has begun consultations with the stakeholders on the possible options, they said.

This is the second attempt of by the Oil Ministry to take away some of the fields of state-owned ONGC for giving to private and foreign companies.

In October last year, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had identified 15 producing fields with collective reserve of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas of national oil companies for handing over to private firms in the hope they would improve upon the baseline estimate and their extraction.

The plan, however, could not go through as ONGC strongly countered the DGH proposal with its own proposal that it be allowed to outsource operations on the same terms as the government plan.

Sources said ONGC is of the view that it should be allowed the same terms that the government extends to private and foreign firms in DSF.

The government gave out 34 fields to private firms by offering them pricing and marketing freedom for oil and gas they produced from the fields in the first round of DSF.

The second round of DSF with 25 fields on offer is currently under bidding.

The fields offered in DSF were taken away from ONGC and Oil India Ltd on the pretext that they were lying idle and unexploited. But under the present proposal, the government plans to take away discovered and producing fields.

Sources said ONGC feels it too should be allowed to seek revenue sharing partnership for its fields. Field operations could be outsourced to foreign or private firms that offered the highest revenue or production share over and above a baseline production.

The ministry is reasoning that the areas where the fields were discovered by ONGC were given to the state-owned firm on nomination basis.

In the proposal that was mooted in October last year, the plan was to give out 60 per cent stake in 15 fields -- 11 of ONGC and four of Oil India. These included Kalok, Ankleshwar, Gandhar and Santhal -- the big four oil fields of ONGC in Gujarat.

The DGH too had identified 44 fields of ONGC and OIL which could take on partners for production enhancement work where bidders would get the 'tariff' that they bid as a return for increasing the output 'over the baseline production' for an initial period of 10 years.

The Oil Ministry is unhappy with the near stagnant oil and gas production and believes giving out the discovered fields to private firms would help raise output as they can bring in technology and capital, sources said.

It has been tasked by the Prime Minister to cut dependence on oil imports by 10 per cent by 2022 from the over 77 per cent dependence in 2014-15. But the dependence has only increased and is now over 83 per cent.

The privatisation is repeat of the infamous round in 1992-93 when medium-sized discovered fields like Panna/Mukta and Tapti oil and gas field in western offshore were given to the now defunct Enron Corp of the US and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). As many as 28 fields were then awarded.

Under this regime, ONGC was made licensee and given an option to farm in 40 per cent of stake. The controversial privatisation under the then oil minister Satish Sharma had resulted in an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).",846,0.3397310972213745

The Geological Survey of India (GSI) is going to use ultra-modern remote-sensing technology developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for the first time in India to map surface mineralogy, an official said on Tuesday.

The Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) will be used to locate minerals like lead, zinc, copper, platinum, diamond, gold and other associated minerals. This sensor is an engineering marvel and has been proved effective for mapping surface mineralogy in different parts of the world, Brij Kumar, additional director general of GSI (western zone), said at press conference.

Recently, Kumar said, AVIRIS-NG sensor was mounted on board an ISRO aircraft for acquiring the hyperspectral images for 14 mineralised blocks in different parts of the country.

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between GSI and National Remote Sensing Centre - Indian Space Research Organization (NRSC-ISRO) in Kolkata in September, he added.

Kumar said that the objective of the MoU was to utilise these airborne hyperspectral data by GSI and ISRO scientists to find surface signatures of mineralisation in those 14 promising areas in the coming three years.

A MoU was signed with Geoscience Australia as a part of 'Project Uncover' to explore the minerals along the stretch of 9,000 sq km from Sikar district to Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh. A MoU is also underway with ONGC to explore new minerals, he added.",241,

Ahead of the general elections next year, the government for the first time in the last four years allowed the state-run oil marketing companies to go for a massive expansion of their retail operations by opening close to 56,000 new fuel pumps across the country.

The move will boost employment generation by thousands and an investment of thousands of crores of rupees.

For the first time, the OMCs have invited bids from private players online to ensure transparency and the bidding process would be conducted by an independent agency.

The expansion of the network is being undertaken by state run OMCs including Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and the ONGC-run Hindustan Petroleum. This will cover around 80 per cent of the total locations.

""For a fast growing economy like ours, energy needs are growing manifold and state run OMCs are undertaking retail network expansion in tandem with the growth in demand of petrol and diesel,"" an IOCL official Parth Vora told reporters here.

Today, around 55,000 fuel pumps are run by OMCs, of which nearly 50 per cent belongs to IOCL. Among the private players, Nyara Energy (formerly Essar Oil) runs more than 3,500 fuel pumps and Reliance has around 600 pumps, while other foreign players such as BP and Shell runs 100 pumps each.

According to statistics, retail sales of petrol and diesel are increasing at the rate of 8 per cent and 4 per cent per annum, respectively.

Vora further said applications for 55,649 outlets have been issued.

""This expansion has been undertaken to meet the growing fuel needs and convenience of customers in emerging markets like the upcoming highways, agricultural pockets and industrial hubs,"" he said.

The retail outlet network in rural, remote and far flung areas are also expanded with the intention of reaching the product, ensuring quality and correct price to meet the rural agricultural demand and people living in remote areas, Vora added. These new outlets will be opened through the next three years.

In a regulatory filing, state-owned ONGC said it is examining the admissibility of the claim.

The Tariff Authority for Major Ports (TAMP) passed an order for wharfage compensation payable by ONGC on October 3, 2018.

TAMP order stated that ""ONGC shall pay to MbPT a compensation at one half of wharfage rate as applicable on the per tonne of crude oil which will be imported into the port of Mumbai through all or any of the ONGC pipelines.""

As per the order, ""a sum of Rs 173.69 crore has to be paid to MbPT by ONGC in lieu of wharfage compensation charges since 2013-14,"" the company said.

MbPT, it said, on October 31 sent a demand of Rs 241.69 crore after including interest at the rate of 18 per cent since 2013-14.

""The issue is being examined for admissibility of the claim and further course of action,"" ONGC said.

ONGC said the dispute between the company and MbPT was pending for a long time over payment of wharfage for the supply of crude oil to local refineries in Mumbai through the pipelines and to coastal refineries through tankers loaded from Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT). Also, payment of 'way leave' charges for pipelines passing through port limit was pending.

""ONGC had objected to the payment of Way Leave Fee for pipelines and wharfage compensation on crude oil in various forums. No payment was made till 1989 although the pipelines were laid way back in 1978. In 1989, ONGC made a provisional payment of Rs 10 crore as per the decision of inter-ministerial meetings,"" the filing said.

The company said it entered into an agreement with MbPT ""under duress on January 28, 2005, in order to receive permission for laying new pipelines.""

The agreement lacked clauses for a duration, exist and arbitration and was a ""unilateral agreement,"" it said.

""ONGC has been making payment to MbPT as per the agreement without receiving any services for levy of compensation for crude oil supplied to local refinery through ONGC's own pipelines (for which way leave fees is being paid regularly) and marine tankers loaded at JNPT,"" it said, adding ONGC had so far made Rs 231.42 crore payment to MbPT.

The company said it has over the years written several letters to the government for resolving the dispute on wharfage compensation and way leave charges but an amicable solution to the problem could not be reached.

A proposal of MbPT for a prescription for wharfage compensation payable by ONGC was sent to TAMP in April 2018.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp's (ONGC) natural gas production has hit an all-time high of about 70 million standard cubic meters per day as it doubles up efforts to raise domestic output to curb imports, sources privy to the development said.

ONGC produced about 64 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) of gas in November last year and this year the output is close to touching 70 mmscmd, sources said.

After accounting for internal consumption, gas sales at about 56 mmscmd too are at an all-time high.

The output can rise by 24-25 mmscmd in next 1-2 years if the company gets market price, that will make about 35 billion cubic meters of recoverable reserves in discoveries in the shallow sea off Andhra Pradesh on the east and off Gujarat and Mumbai on the west coast blocks economically viable.

Natural gas is the fastest growing primary energy source in the world. It is the cleanest burning petroleum-based fuel and has wide applications -- from being used to generate electricity to the running of automobiles (CNG) and firing kitchen stoves.

With a view to reducing dependence on imports for meeting energy needs and cutting greenhouse emissions, India is looking at increasing consumption of natural gas by more than doubling its share in energy basket to 15 per cent in next few years.

Sources said, ONGC has been constrained by the current USD 3.36 per million British thermal unit price of gas fixed by the government, which is a third of the rate at which India imports gas in its liquid form (LNG).

This price is way below the cost of production for block GK-28/42 in Gulf of Kutch, off the Gujarat coast, Mumbai offshore block MB-OSN-2005/1 and Krishna Godavari basin block KG-OSN-2005/1, which cumulatively can produce about 10 mmscmd.

A similar amount of gas can come from onland discoveries and another 5 mmscmd can be added if investment to made in redevelopment projects of Mumbai High South, Neelam and B-127 cluster are made economical with the market price, they said.

ONGC had in 2017-18 fiscal year (April 2017 to March 2018) produced 23.484 billion cubic meters of natural gas, 6.3 per cent higher than 22.099 bcm output in the previous 2016-17 financial year.

This was the highest gas output by the company in five years and the growth rate was higher than the global average of 3-4 per cent year-on-year.

Sources said the company has stepped up efforts to bring newer fields into production after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a stiff target of reducing oil import dependence by 10 per cent by 2022. India currently imports over 80 per cent of its oil needs.

The growth in output was largely contributed by C-26 Cluster fields, Daman and Vasai East fields in the western offshore as well as sub-sea well S2AB in the eastern offshore, sources said adding ONGC has charted out a plan to double the gas production at 42.7 bcm by 2021-22.

It is investing Rs 57,000 crore - one of the highest investments in the world in gas projects - in the high potential KG-DWN-98/2 project in the Bay of Bengal as well as in developing other discoveries on off the west coast.",547,0.7747333645820618

India's natural gas production will rise by a third provided the output locked in a dozen fields of state-owned ONGC and OIL is opened up by giving remunerative market prices, people with knowledge of the matter said. India currently produces about 90 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) of natural gas and has ambitious plans to double output by 2022 to reduce its reliance on imports and replace some of the polluting liquid fuels to cut emissions.

Sources said, while the doubling of output would need huge capital expenditure of close to $10 billion in bringing to production discoveries in deep sea and frontier areas, discoveries already made by ONGC and OIL provide a low hanging fruit.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) haven't been able to develop the discoveries or bring them to production as the current gas price of $3.36 per million British thermal unit (MMBtu) is way lower than the cost of production.

Sources said, ONGC has about 35 billion cubic meters of recoverable reserves in discoveries in the shallow sea off Andhra Pradesh on the east and off Gujarat and Mumbai on the west coast blocks.

The three blocks in Krishna Godavari basin, Gulf of Kutch and Mumbai offshore can produce about 10 mmscmd of gas and an equivalent amount can be produced from its onshore discoveries in blocks like Bantumili, Mandapeta and Bhuvanagiri, they said.

About 5 mmscmd of production can be added by making some investment in existing fields like Mumbai High South, Neelam and B-127 Cluster in the Arabian Sea.

Oil India Ltd (OIL) has an onland discovery in the Krishna Godavari basin in Andhra Pradesh with over 3 billion cubic meters of recoverable reserves but needs a higher price to bring it to production.

Sources said, all these fields can be expeditiously developed and monetised in case pricing and marketing freedom is granted by the government.

ONGC and OIL want a price of over $6 per MMBtu to help them produce the gas without suffering any losses. In the absence of a viable gas price, they will have to mothball $3 billion projects, they said.

The BJP-led government had in October 2014, evolved a new pricing formula using rates prevalent in gas surplus nations like US, Canada and Russia to determine price in a net importing country.

Prices using this formula are calculated semi-annually.

While the government has allowed a higher rate of $7.67 per mmBtu for gas fields in difficult areas like the deep sea, ONGC's Krishna Godavari basin block KG-OSN-2004/1, which has about 15 bcm of recoverable reserves, is in shallow waters and does not qualify as a 'difficult field'.

Similar is the fate of Mumbai basin block MB-OSN-2005/1 on the western side. The block GK-28/42 in Gulf of Kutch is a nomination block which does not qualify for higher rates, they said.

The onland discoveries of ONGC and OIL too do not qualify for the higher rates.

While ONGC's KG block can produce a peak output of 5 mmscmd, the same from GK-28/42 is expected to be around 2.5 mmscmd. Peak output from MB-OSN-2005/1 is expected to a little less than 3 mmscmd.

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha on March 20, 2017, had stated that the cost of production of natural gas in the prolific Krishna Godavari basin is between $4.99 to $7.30 per mmBtu.",582,0.9964352250099182

The government will next week launch the fourth tranche of CPSE Exchange Traded Fund to garner up to Rs 14,000 crore, investment banking sources said. The government has already raised Rs 11,500 crore in the earlier three tranches of the ETF, which functions like a mutual fund scheme.

The issue will open early next week and investors would get 3.5-4 percent discount over the issue price, the sources said.

The government is aiming to mop up Rs 8,000 crore, with a green-shoe option to retain either Rs 4,000 crore or Rs 6,000 crore from the fourth tranche of CPSE ETF, they added.

The number of scrips in the CPSE ETF has been increased to 11 state-owned companies, as against 10 earlier, with the entry of four new firms namely NTPC, SJVN, NLC and NBCC.

Three existing companies, GAIL, Engineers India Ltd (EIL) and Container Corporation of India, have been removed from the index as the government holding in these companies has fallen below 55 percent.

Since the weightage and scrip value of these three companies were higher, four new CPSEs had to be included in the ETF to replace them to keep the CPSE ETF index value at the same level.

The other seven bluechip PSUs in the CPSE ETF are ONGC, Coal India, IOC, Oil India, PFC, REC and Bharat Electronics.

CPSE ETF was set up in 2014 and the government has so far sold stake in the 10 companies in the basket in three tranches, thereby raising Rs 11,500 crore -- Rs 3,000 crore from the first tranche in March 2014, Rs 6,000 crore in January 2017 and Rs 2,500 crore from the third in March 2017.

In June 2018, the government garnered about Rs 8,400 crore through follow-on offer of another ETF -- Bharat 22 ETF, which comprises shares of 22 companies, including banks.

The government has mopped up over Rs 15,000 crore so far this fiscal through PSU disinvestment, which includes about Rs 5,300 crore from Coal India share sale, Rs 1,700 crore from IPOs of four PSUs -- RITES, IRCON, MIDHANI and Garden Reach Shipbuilders.

The budgeted target from PSU disinvestment in current fiscal is Rs 80,000 crore.",373,

Motilal Oswal's research report on ONGC

ONGC reported net operating income of INR280b (est. 301b, +48% YoY, +17% QoQ), lower than our estimate due to higher-than-expected discount of 2.4% to Brent for oil price realization and lower oil sales. EBITDA came in at INR158b (est. 168b, +51% YoY, +39% QoQ). Depreciation including write-offs stood at INR48.5b (est. 63.6b, flat YoY, -23% QoQ), lower than our estimate due to lower write-offs. Other income stood at INR23.9b (est. 8b, +24% YoY, -36% QoQ). Despite lower-than-expected EBITDA, PAT stood at INR82.6b (est. 70.2b, +61% YoY, +40% QoQ), higher than our estimate due to much lower depreciation and higher other income.

Outlook

The government is mulling selling as many as 149 small and marginal oil and gas fields of ONGC to private and foreign companies and allow the state-owned firm to focus only on big fields, sources with knowledge of the development said.

On the anvil is some kind of extension of the Discovered Small Field (DSF) bid round where discovered and producing fields of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) are auctioned to firms offering the maximum share of output to the government, sources said.

This is the second attempt by the oil ministry to take away some of the fields of ONGC for private and foreign companies.

In October last year, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had identified 15 producing fields with collective reserve of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic meters of gas of national oil companies for handing over to private firms in the hope that they would improve upon the baseline estimate and its extraction.

The plan, however, could not go through as ONGC strongly countered the DGH proposal with its own suggestion that it be allowed to outsource operations on same terms as the government plan.

Sources said the current plan started as a follow up of the October 12 meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review domestic production profile of oil and gas and the road map for cutting import dependence by 10 per cent by 2022.

At a meeting, the ministry made a presentation showing that while 95 per cent of ONGC's production was from 60 large fields, 149 smaller fields contributed to a mere five per cent.

It was suggested at the meeting that these smaller fields could be given out to private and foreign firms and ONGC could concentrate on the big ones where it could rope in technology partners through production enhancement contracts (PEC) or technical service arrangements.

Sources said thereafter a six-member committee under NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant was set up to give a proposal on the same.

ONGC, however, is opposed to the plan as it feels it should be allowed the same terms that the government extends to private and foreign firms in DSF.

The government gave out 34 fields to private firms by offering them pricing and marketing freedom for oil and gas they produced from the fields in the first round of DSF. A second round of DSF with 25 fields on offer is currently under bidding.

The fields offered in DSF were taken away from ONGC and Oil India Ltd on the pretext that they were lying idle and unexploited. But under the present proposal, the government plans to take away discovered and producing fields.

Sources said ONGC feels it too should be allowed to seek revenue sharing partnership for its fields. Field operations could be outsourced to foreign or private firms that offered the highest revenue or production share over and above a baseline production.

The ministry is reasoning that the areas where the fields discovered by ONGC were given to the state-owned firm on nomination basis.

In the proposal that was mooted in October last year, the plan was to give out 60 per cent stake in 15 fields -- 11 of ONGC and four of Oil India. These included Kalok, Ankleshwar, Gandhar and Santhal -- the big four oilfields of ONGC in Gujarat.

The DGH too had identified 44 fields of ONGC and OIL, which could take on partners for production enhancement work where bidders would get the 'tariff' that they bid as a return for increasing the output 'over the baseline production' for an initial period of 10 years.

The oil ministry is unhappy with the near stagnant oil and gas production and believes giving out the discovered fields to private firms would help raise output as they can bring in technology and capital, sources said.

It has been tasked by the prime minister to cut dependence on oil imports by 10 per cent by 2022 over 77 percent in 2014-15. But, the dependence has only increased and is now over 83 percent.

The privatisation is repeat of the infamous round in 1992-93 when medium sized discovered fields like Panna/Mukta and Tapti oil and gas field in the western offshore was given to now defunct Enron Corp of the US and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).

As many as 28 fields were then awarded. Under this regime, ONGC was made licensee and given an option to farm in 40 percent of stake. The controversial privatisation under the then oil minister Satish Sharma had resulted in an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has reported a healthy 34.5 percent sequential growth in second quarter profit to Rs 8,264.6 crore, largely driven by other income and operating margin.

Profit in previous quarter stood at Rs 6,143.8 crore.

Revenue from operations grew by 2.9 percent during the quarter to Rs 27,989.1 crore compared to Rs 27,212.8 crore in April-June period, the PSU oil & gas exploration company said.

At operating level, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased 7.2 percent sequentially to Rs 15,788.74 crore and margin expanded 226 bps to 56.4 percent in quarter ended September 2018.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation will draw a new perspective plan to integrate recent acquisition HPCL and just commissioned petrochemical unit with its mainstay oil and gas exploration and production operations, its Chairman and MD Shashi Shanker said.

The nation's largest oil and natural gas producer is keen that its recent diversification into refining business as also petrochemicals is leveraged to full by integrating them with its core business.

""Post-acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and commissioning of OPaL petrochemical plant at Dahej (in Gujarat), the company is drawing up a perspective plan to achieve proper synergies from the integration to maximize value, optimize cost and enhance efficiency,"" Shanker said.

Synergies like the use of naphtha and other liquid hydrocarbons ONGC produces in the petrochemical unit set up by ONGC Petro-additions Ltd to produce value-added products as well as integrating refining stream of HPCL with company's existing subsidiary, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd can result in huge opportunities, he said.

""ONGC today is chasing the hydrocarbon molecule to the last mile to derive the best value from it at the minimal cost,"" he said, adding the company wants to put in place a well-knit strategic plan to bolster its presence in the entire hydrocarbon value chain.

ONGC earlier this year bought government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore, adding 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to its portfolio that made it the third-largest refiner in the country after Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Reliance Industries Ltd.

ONGC already is the majority owner of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, which has a 15-million tonnes refinery.

The idea is to prepare a strategy to strengthen the integration further so that business growth is well diversified and risk well distributed to tide over the volatility due to fluctuations in global crude oil prices, he said.

The company has already mapped the production profile from its deepwater project in the KG Basin.

Block KG-DWN-98/2 will help double ONGC's gas production by 2022.

The current gas production stands at 23 billion cubic meters, which is expected to reach nearly 42 BCM by 2022. Oil production is also set to increase from the present level of 22 million tonnes to 25.6 million tonnes by 2022.

Also, the acquisition of Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's (GSPC) Deen Dayal West (DDW) block in KG basin has given ONGC ready infrastructure and facilities to produce from its high-pressure, high-temperature (HP-HT) fields.

This will also help in early monetization of other fields in the vicinity, which are a part of HP-HT Corridor, Shanker said. ""Rig has already been deployed in Deen Dayal West (DDW) field for drilling and hydro-fracturing in order to boost production from this field"".

ONGC Group recorded a net profit of Rs 22,106 crore on a turnover of Rs 204,019 crore in 2017-18 fiscal year.

The business strategy being finalised would also focus on opening up of new basins to replenish reserves and increase its production, he said.

The company already operates in six out of seven discovered basins in the country.",523,0.9682666808366776

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan's assertion notwithstanding, oil refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) continues not to recognise ONGC, its majority owner, as its promoter company.

In a filing to stock exchanges on the company's shareholding pattern as of the end of September, HPCL continues to list ""President of India"" as its promoter with ""zero"" percent shareholding.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which earlier this year bought the government's entire 51.11 percent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore, is listed a ""public shareholder"", owning ""77.88 crores"" shares or ""51.11 percent"" shareholding of the company.

Calls made to HPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana for comments went answered.

ONGC, which had to borrow Rs 24,876 crore for the acquisition that helped the government meet its disinvestment target for the 2017-18 fiscal, had made its displeasure clear about not being recognised as a promoter of HPCL.

In a strongly worded letter to HPCL, it a couple of months back had warned of regulatory consequences of not recognising the majority shareholder as the promoter, sources privy to the development said.

HPCL, however, has stuck to its gun and has refused to recognise ONGC as its promoter.

When the issue first arose in August, Pradhan had clearly stated that ONGC is the new promoter of HPCL.

ONGC, he had said, had invested in acquiring a majority stake in the company and so it is the promoter. ""ONGC is the promoter of HPCL,"" he had said.

Pradhan's comments followed Surana rejecting ONGC's demand for being recognised as the promoter of the company. ""Whatever we are doing, whatever we have done and whatever we will be doing will be as per our understanding of the statute and the guidelines and Companies Act and the SEBI guidelines... Beyond that who is interpreting whatever, it is his understanding of the situation. We need not subscribe to that,"" he said.

After ONGC bought out government stake, HPCL became its subsidiary. Since ONGC takeover in January, HPCL has made three stock exchange filings about the shareholding pattern of the company -- the first on April 20, then on July 12 and finally on October 19. In all three, ONGC is shown as the public shareholder and President of India listed as the promoter.

Sources said ONGC feels the HPCL management is bound to take corrective action to reflect the true picture.

According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India's rules, the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company.

When Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had bought the government's stake in fuel retailer IBP Co, it was listed as the latter's promoter in every instance after the deal. The same was the case when IOC acquired a majority stake in Chennai Petroleum Corp (CPCL).

Surana has retained the title of Chairman and Managing Director despite corporate governance structure require a group having just one chairman and subsidiaries being run by managing directors and CEOs.

ONGC's overseas subsidiary, ONGC Videsh Ltd, is headed by a Managing Director and CEO. Its refinery subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), which is listed on BSE, too is led by a Managing Director and CEO. ONGC Chairman is the head of boards of both the companies.

Since acquiring a majority stake in HPCL, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board.

ONGC has appointed its Director (Finance) Subhash Kumar to HPCL board. He has replaced Sushma Taishete Rath, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.",605,-0.9977991282939911

The market resumed their declining trend last week and lost over one-and-a-half percent, pressurised by weak local cues and correction in the global markets.

This week started on an optimistic note amid mixed macroeconomic data, however, participation was limited mainly to the handful of index majors.

In the latter half of the last week, the market changed its tone completely and the benchmark indices plunged sharply after testing their crucial resistance zone.

Meanwhile, earnings announcements kept the participants busy as stocks witnessed volatile moves across sectors. Finally, Nifty settled at 10,303.55, down by 1.61 percent.

We expect volatility to remain high this week, too, thanks to the upcoming derivatives expiry and prevailing earnings season. Besides, movement on the currency front and indications from global markets will also be in focus.

On the earnings front, we have some of the big names viz. HDFC Bank, HCL Technologies, TVS Motors, Bajaj Auto, Maruti Suzuki India, Yes Bank, Dr. Reddy, ICICI Bank, ITC, Bharti Airtel, Biocon, and Kotak Mahindra Bank will be announcing their results during the week along with several others.

It’s getting difficult for the participants with every passing day. The recent turmoil in NBFC stocks has changed the sentiment and it will take time to subside.

Besides, issues pertaining to currency deterioration and correction in the world markets are adding to the worries. Considering the scenario, we advise maintaining “Sell on rise” approach and keeping leveraged positions hedged. Also, we suggest focusing more on stock selection.

On benchmark front, we expect Nifty to continue within a broader range of 10,100-10,700 in the near future and either side decisive breakout would trigger the next directional move.

Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 6-7% return in the short term:

Aurobindo Pharma: Buy| Target: Rs 820| Stop-Loss: Rs 730| Return 7.9%

Aurobindo Pharma has been consolidating in a range of Rs 720-800 levels for the last one month after retesting its previous high of around Rs 825.

The overall chart formation combined with signals from the confirmation indicators are clearly pointing towards a strong up move ahead. Traders shouldn’t miss this chance and accumulate in the range Rs 750-760. It closed at Rs 759 on October 22, 2018.

Canara Bank: Sell Nov Futures| Target: Rs 198| Stop-Loss: Rs 224 | Return 7.5%

PSU counters are either consolidating around their 52-week low or inching lower and Canara Bank is no different. It has witnessed a fresh breakdown on October 22, after hovering around its recent low and likely to see fresh fall ahead.

Traders should use any uptick to go short in the given range 214-216. It closed at 213 on October 22, 2018.

ONGC: Sell Nov Futures| Target: Rs 148| Stop-Loss: Rs 166 | Return 6.3%

ONGC witnessed the marginal recovery of late but failed to surpass the hurdle of multiple moving averages on the daily chart around 165 and formed a fresh short pivot. Indications are in the favor of negative trend to extend further.

Traders are advised to create fresh shorts within the range 158-160. It closed at 156.95 on October 22, 2018.

Ruchi AgrawalMoneycontrol Research

Under pressure from the government, Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Oil India and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) have been asked to consider buying back a portion of their shares.

After the failure of some strategic sales, like that of Air India, due to varied reasons, the buyback route is being seen as a tool to meet the year’s divestment target by the government. While the government is pushing to get the buyback through, oil companies have been reluctant owing to scheduled capex plans. However, they might have to give in to the government’s directives. In the short term, it could be positive for the minority shareholders as well.

Details of the buyback

The total buyback programme is slated to be around Rs 9,900 crore. Of this, around Rs 4,000 crore is expected from Indian Oil Corporation, ONGC is expected to take up Rs 4800 and the remaining Rs 1,100 crore is to be brought in by Oil India.

The government’s side

With rising oil prices, depreciating rupee and planned investment expenditure, the government’s fiscal position has been strained. The proposed buyback is an attempt to fund the deficit by the government. It amounts to almost 13 percent of the divestment target for the current fiscal and provides a way to achieve the year’s target.

While the government has the option to sell the stake in the companies, buy back seems a safer option which could fetch higher than market price for the stake, given the waning investor interest in the oil companies owing to rising uncertainty.

What it means for the companies

The three companies have the required liquidity to fund the buyback. IOC's total cash and liquid investments amount to around Rs 41,544 crore (on 31 March 2018) and the current buyback amounts to 9.6 percent of this.

Oil India has substantial free cash and the buyback amounts for 8 percent of its total cash and liquid investments.

On the other hand, while ONGC also has the required free cash to fund the buyback, looking at its total free cash and liquid investment, the buyback seems a bit hefty and amounts to around 42 percent of its total cash and liquid investments.

While the companies have enough liquidity to fund the buyback, the added buyback expense might tighten the position for the companies planned capital expenditures, especially for ONGC.

The three companies have sizeable capex plans for the year with IOC planning to spend Rs 23,000 crore in the current year, ONGC planning Rs 38,000 crore capex and Oil India’s capex plan for the current year being close to Rs 4,300 crore.

Outlook

We believe while IOC and Oil India have enough liquidity to fund both the buyback and the capex, it might put ONGC in a tough spot, which could have an impact on the company’s dividend payments.

On one hand, a cut in the dividend might not go well with the government’s revenue department, on the other hand, we believe altered balance sheet position might come in the way of future growth. Moreover, ONGC and Oil India have already been under pressure owing to the contingent burden of subsidy sharing in times of higher crude oil prices and buyback could further weaken the position.

Moreover, rising crude oil prices have brought the margins of both oil upstream companies and oil marketing firms (OMC) under the scanner. While on one hand public outrage has led to shrinking margins for OMCs, it has exposed upstream oil PSUs to probable subsidy sharing and policy burden from the government. In such operationally strained time, the buyback would mean an added expense for these companies.

However, the proposed buyback would surely help the government to ease its stressed fiscal position the move will help to inch slightly towards meeting the year’s divestment target.Follow @Ruchiagrawal

Boards of oil companies Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India are considering buying back shares worth Rs 10,000 crore under pressure from the government, which is scrambling to meet its divestment target, sources told The Economic Times.

The three oil companies have protested and warned the government of a dividend cut after the Centre demanded these buybacks over the next couple of months, the report said. They have also approached the Prime Minister’s Office and sought intervention to resolve this issue.

ONGC’s buyback is expected to be of about Rs 4,800 crore, Oil India’s Rs 1,100 crore and IOC may acquire 3 percent of its shareholding valued at Rs 4,000 crore.

Sources told the paper that ONGC and Oil India will use internal resources to fund this buyback, while IOC may have to rely on debt to fund this purchase. At the end of March, IOC and ONGC had a borrowing of Rs 45,000 crore and Rs 14,000 crore, respectively.

The government set a divestment target of Rs 80,000 crore and announced buyback plans for oil companies to help meet this target. However, oil companies think the Centre has set too steep a target for them, the report said.

Company executives told the paper that in a bid to fulfil their own targets, the Disinvestment and Revenue Departments are forgetting that oil companies have big capex obligations and no great cash reserves.

Sources told the paper that the Revenue Department is looking to match last year’s dividend payout, which was Rs 14,600 crore, of which IOC paid Rs 5,500 crore and ONGC Rs 5,200 crore.

IOC wants to expand its refining, transportation and marketing capacity and plans to spend Rs 1,50,000 crore over the next six years, including capex of Rs 23,000 crore this fiscal. ONGC has similar plans and intends to spend Rs 38,000 crore in FY19. Oil India’s capex for this year stands at Rs 4,300 crore.

The government owns majority stake in these companies and can sell these shares to raise funds, but sources said a buyback is a safer option as it would help realise better-than-market price without encountering investor uncertainty.",372,0.01354914903640747

Allaying concerns about the return of fuel subsidy regime, a top Finance Ministry official Thursday said the government asking oil PSUs to subsidise petrol and diesel prices by Re 1 per litre was a ""one-time thing"" and it does not intend to ask them to do it again.

While oil marketing companies will continue to enjoy marketing freedom, upstream oil producers like ONGC would not be asked to share fuel subsidy burden, he said.

Just last week, the government had cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre and asked state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) to subsidise the two fuels by another Re 1 a litre.

But most of the Rs 2.50 per litre reduction in rates effected from October 5 has been lost in increases in selling prices on subsequent days, giving rise to the suspicion that the government may again ask OMCs to subsidise fuel.

""The Re 1 absorption by OMCs in their pricing was a one-time thing,"" the official said.

Petrol & Diesel Rates Yesterday Petrol Rate in Mumbai Yesterday Current Petrol Price Per Litre ₹106 106 View more Diesel Rate in Mumbai Yesterday Current Petrol Price Per Litre ₹94 94 View more Show

The government, he said, has no intention of asking them to do that again.

Following the comments, shares of OMCs surged by as much as 19 per cent intra-day, defying the broader market trends. Shares of HPCL surged 19 per cent to hit a high of Rs 215.40, BPCL jumped 7 per cent to Rs 284.80 and IOC gained nearly 8 per cent to Rs 134 in intra-day trade.

The benchmark BSE Sensex fell 759.74 points to close at 34,001.

The cut in excise duty and OMCs absorbing some prices had led to a drop in the price of petrol from a record high of Rs 84 per litre to Rs 81.50 in Delhi and that of diesel from an all-time high of Rs 75.45 to Rs 72.95 a litre on October 5. But rate hikes on subsequent days have pushed prices up.

Petrol has risen by 86 paise per litre since then and diesel by Rs 1.67, negating the entire excise duty reduction in less than a week.

Petrol price in Delhi Thursday stood at Rs 82.36 per cent while diesel was priced at Rs 74.62.

The official said the government is also not looking at bringing back the subsidy sharing mechanism where upstream firms like ONGC subsidised cooking fuels LPG and kerosene by giving discounts on crude oil they sold to refiners.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) shares surged to Rs 159.60 during intra-day trade on the BSE before ending at Rs 152.90, up 2.86 per cent.

Oil producers ONGC and Oil India Ltd had till June 2015 made good as much as 40 per cent of the under-recoveries or subsidy arising out of selling fuel at below market price. It was speculated that the same subsidy sharing in some form may be brought back.

According to Moody's Investors Service, share prices of state-owned oil companies have declined around 20 per cent on average since the government on October 4 announced a reduction in the country's fuel prices.

The aggregate market capitalisation of the six largest listed government owned/linked oil companies had fallen by Rs 1.2 lakh crore since then, it said.

""The share price decline is credit negative for the oil companies because of the high level of cross-shareholdings in one another. The market values of their respective investments have declined, reducing their financial flexibility,"" it said in a report Thursday.

The market continues to remain under heavy selling pressure despite touching a record high in August-end. The Sensex has corrected more than 3,500 points on rising oil prices and a falling rupee that has a direct impact on the broadening current account deficit.

Additionally, on Thursday, the government cut excise duty on oil to the tune of Rs 1.5 per litre and asked oil marketing companies (OMCs) to absorb Re 1 per litre with respect to petrol & diesel prices. This has increased the subsidy burden on oil PSUs like ONGC among others.

The impact was visible as HPCL, IOC, BPCL, GAIL, MRPL, ONGC and Oil India all were seen down by 10-28 percent.

Sridhar Sivaram, Investment Director of Enam Holdings told CNBC-TV18 in an interview, ""The market is smart enough to know such things well in advance, which is why we have been seeing a fall in oil marketing companies for long.""

Crude

Sivaram feels that the crude is expected to stay negative for India and on top of it US interest rates are going up. In such case, emerging markets (EM) generally underperform.

Emerging markets have been down 12-13 percent and Indian markets have fallen 15 percent in dollar terms in more than a month now. ""Overall EMs are in a tough spot right now. Look at 2013 data where EMs had faced a similar situation and then came back in growth in 2014-15,"" he said.

He further said, ""Interest rate is going up but global growth is also inching higher, so look at the US and China both are growing. Emerging markets in select pockets are also growing but at a slow pace because of reset of currencies and market movement.""

Currently, he said he would be a buyer. ""If one remembers, in 2013 also we faced a similar situation where crude was at $80 a barrel, currencies falling, people worried about state elections and growth.""

Speaking on the outlook in the coming days, he said currently there are many opportunities which are looking interesting. One can consider companies that have good earnings potential and high cash levels on books, as prices have significantly corrected.

""I would do staggered buying for over a month or two as stocks have the potential to make smart money after 12-18 months despite election noise.""

Rate hike

He feels the hike of 25 bps seems to have already priced in but he won't be surprised if RBI maintains a status quo. He expects a 50 bps hike in repo rate by the end of FY19.

""If one looks at the inflation of August, and September's number will come with base effect so it is nearly five percent, which both are still under RBI's expectations levels,"" Sivaram said, adding that the food inflation is very benign.

NBFCs

Sivaram said he is not a big fan of NBFCs and particularly housing finance companies (HFC). ""Currently these companies are in cash conservation mode. Significant MF outflow has happened, corporates are panicking and exiting. So I don't think banks are going to open the tap for them.""

Big NBFCs and HFCs can manage to get funds but smaller ones will struggle and then they have to cut down growth targets over the next 12-15 months, he believes.

He says that he is not a bottom fisher in this segment. But he feels high CASA bank will significantly benefit from this NBFC situation. ""It is a similar situation like demonetisation for them. Banks will not get high return on money but they will get deposits. So it is great news for banks and within financial space, I will double up my banks' exposure.""

He said in case of HFC, RBI should come out with disclosure norms where HFCs have to disclose their asset side. ""Generally disclosure norms are great for long term.""

FII selling

FIIs sold more than Rs 15,000 crore worth of shares from September 2018 while DIIs remained net buyers to the tune of Rs 17,000 crore worth of shares in the same period.

Sivaram said flows can never take the market higher. ""In the past, we have seen that earnings and other macro factors take the market higher. Now earnings started improving and macros will improve irrespective what flows are.""

Auto

Auto sales for August, as well as September, were mixed with commercial vehicles continuing to show good growth.

""I would say currently there is a slowdown in auto with good growth in the commercial vehicles segment. It is very difficult to pinpoint particular stock but I am still betting on auto due to structural growth,"" Sivaram said.

Consumption

Sivaram said he would wait for one more quarter for taking a call on consumption stocks. ""Broadly I would buy on dips in domestic companies including consumption, banks, construction but not IT and Pharma.""

Rupee, earnings growth, and US growth helped IT stocks rally faster in last one year.

He said the rupee never helped IT companies if we consider the history. In fact, it is the business that gets help due to a rupee fall, he added.

He feels there is going to be a disruption in IT due to a lack of out of the box innovation. ""Digital is not big enough considering their balance sheet as they have to think out of the box which can give a sense for the next five years.""",903,-0.10495174924532573

Share price of engineering and construction major Larsen & Toubro rallied as much as 4 percent in morning on Thursday after its hydrocarbon engineering segment received subsea contract from country's largest oil & gas exploration company ONGC.

L&T Hydrocarbon Engineering (LTHE) in consortium with Baker Hughes, a GE company and McDermott International, Inc. has received subsea contract from Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) for largest deepwater oil & gas project, the development of block DWN-98/2 in the Krishna Godavari basin.

The integrated subsea package includes the supply of all subsea production systems (SPS), including 34 deepwater trees, and the installation of subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines (SURF) at a water depth of between 984 feet (300 meters) and 10,500 feet (3,200 meters).

""LTHE's scope of work encompasses fabrication engineering, procurement and coating of around 500 kms linepipes, stalk fabrication of around 300 kms linepipes and fabrication, testing a loadout of around 185 subsea structures including 6 subsea manifolds and onshore pipeline installation.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) said it has awarded a Rs 11,740.86 crore contract for development of its mega KG-D5 oil and gas fields to a consortium of Baker Hughes, McDermott International and L&T Hydrocarbon Engineering.

ONGC is developing a cluster of oil and gas discoveries in Krishna Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) at a cost of over $5 billion. The first gas is targeted for end 2019 and oil in March 2021.

The consortium was awarded the subsea production system (SPS) including 34 deepwater trees, and the installation of subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines (SURF) at water depth of between 300 metres and 3,200 metres, it said in a statement.

""This tender is one of the biggest integrated (SPS + SURF) tenders awarded globally in recent years,"" ONGC said.

ONGC said it took a strategic decision of integrating hitherto separate work packages of SPS and SURF into a single integrated.

""This will help eliminate major interface issues among SPS and SURF packages, resulting in time and cost optimisation to the company,"" the statement said.

Total peak gas production rate from Cluster-2 is envisaged to be about 16 million standard cubic metres per day and peak oil production rate of 80,000 barrels per day.

""ONGC envisages commencement of first gas production by December 2019, first oil by March 2021 and overall project completion by August 2021,"" it added.

Baker Hughes, a GE company, will provide all of the subsea hardware as well as pre-commissioning services, and McDermott will bring its specialized fleet of pipelay and construction vessels and engineering, procurement, construction and installation capabilities, the two firms said in a separate statement.

""By reducing the number of interfaces across the project, the group aims to reduce complexity, drive speed and increase execution efficiency for ONGC,"" it said.

The project is one of the first major deepwater developments in India and a milestone for realizing country's domestic energy potential.

""The group will offer a comprehensive solution that will also boost local manufacturing, in support of Make in India,"" the statement by Baker Hughes and McDermott said. The subsea award represents the largest single subsea contract awarded by ONGC.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is not in a hurry to sell its stake in Indian Oil Corp and GAIL (India) and will wait for the right price before offloading the shares, a senior company official said. ONGC holds 13.77 percent stake in oil refiner IOC and 4.86 percent in gas utility GAIL India.

""It is true that we are now a fully integrated company. We are India's largest oil and gas producer and the acquisition of (oil refiner) HPCL has extended our presence in the downstream industries.

""And so naturally, it now does not make sense for ONGC to hold stake in Indian Oil Corp (IOC). But, we will wait for the right price,"" said the official.

ONGC, he said, got over Rs 3,000 crore in dividend income from investments in IOC and GAIL in 2017-18 financial year.

""This is a decent return on capital and can help me hold on to shares for long,"" he said. ""I am in no hurry to sell the stake. We will wait for the right price.""

ONGC's 13.77 per cent stake in IOC at Monday's closing price of Rs 153.80 apiece on BSE is worth over Rs 20,500 crore. Its 4.86 per cent stake in GAIL is worth close to Rs 4,200 crore at Monday's closing price of Rs 380.75.

""IOC shares were trading at around Rs 195 in January and are now at Rs 153-154. It doesn't make sense to sell the shares at such a big loss,” the official said.

ONGC, he said, is generating enough surplus mainly because of international oil prices spiking to four-year high and the rupee plummeting to an all-time low.

It is using these to pay off Rs 24,881 crore loan it had taken to buy Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,915 crore.

A third of the loan has already been pre-paid, he said.

ONGC had borrowed Rs 24,881 crore on a short-term loan to fund buying of the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL. The remaining came from its cash reserves.

The official said the pace of repayment may slow down in the third and fourth quarters owing to outgo on taxes and dividend as also the fact that capital spending would peak by then.

Initially, ONGC considered selling its stake in IOC and GAIL to fund the acquisition, but it has never found the right price to offload the shares, he said.

The short-term loan ONGC availed had a provision to prepay without any penalty.

ONGC had held talks with Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) for selling IOC and GAIL shares but the state-owned insurer insisted on buying them at 10 per cent discount to the prevailing price. ONGC thus decided against the share sale.

ONGC's purchase of HPCL created India's first integrated oil company. This was ONGC's biggest acquisition and second buyout of 2017-18 after its Rs 7,738 crore acquisition of 80 per cent stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's KG basin gas block.

HPCL added 23.8 million tonne of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.",535,-0.4161015748977661

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will barely break even at the new natural gas price that will come into effect from October 1, its Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker has said. The government has announced a 10 per cent higher price for natural gas at $3.36 per million British thermal unit for six month period beginning October 1.

Shanker said the average cost of production of natural gas by ONGC during 2017-18 was $3.59 per million British thermal unit.

In the current fiscal, it may be slightly less as cost of service has come down and so ""maybe we will just be able to break even after the new gas price"", he told reporters here.

ONGC's average cost of production of natural gas during 2016-17 was $3.10 per mmBtu and at the government mandated prices it was incurring significant under-recoveries from its gas business, he said.

Loss of revenues on gas business significantly impaired the company's ability to fund its capex plans and hampers most ongoing and future development projects.

ONGC has long complained that gas price is unremunerative and it incurs loss on the business.

As per a new mechanism approved by the government in October 2014, the price of domestically produced natural gas is to be revised every six months -- April 1 and October 1 -- using weighted average of rates prevalent in gas surplus markets like Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (UK excluding Russia), Alberta (Canada) and Russia.

Using this formula, the price for October 2018 to March 2019 came to $3.36 per mmBtu as compared to $3.06 in the previous six months.

ONGC officials said the $3.59 per mmBtu average cost is without taking into account return on capital and after considering a decent return the price should be not less than $4.

India's largest natural gas producer is demanding a floor or minimum price of natural gas be fixed at $4.2 per mmBtu for the business to make economic sense.

The official said ONGC's significant discoveries in KG basin and Gulf of Kutch would need a higher price to bring them to production.

Gas discoveries in the shallow sea off Andhra Pradesh on the east, and off Gujarat on the west are economically unviable to produce at the current government-mandated price of $3.36, he said, adding that in the absence of a viable gas price, it will have to mothball the $1.5-billion projects.

The official said the Krishna Godavari basin block KG- OWN-2004/1 is in shallow water and does not qualify as a difficult field, which get higher gas price of $7.67 per mmBtu from October 1. On the western side, the block GK-28 in Gulf of Kutch is a nomination block which does not qualify for higher rates, he said.

While the KG block will produce a peak output of 5.35 million standard cubic metres per day, the same from Gulf of Kutch block will be around 3 mmscmd. It would take a minimum of three years to bring the gas finds to production.

The combined output is about 14 per cent of the ONGCs current output of 60 mmscmd. He said the KG block discoveries are in water depth of just about 8-metres, developing which is costly since ultra- shallow rigs are scarce and therefore expensive.

ONGC also has a couple of smaller fields with a total expected peak production of 1.1 mmscmd, which cannot viably produce at the current domestic gas prices.",618,-0.9999729990959167

ONGC Videsh and its partners in Russia's Sakhalin-1 project have agreed to pay Russian giant Rosneft $230 million to settle an oil production dispute out-of-court, its managing director N K Verma said.

Rosneft had dragged the Sakhalin-1 consortium to court alleging ""unjust enrichment and interest gained by using other people's money"" and claimed $1.4 billion in damages. The allegations were denied by the consortium.

""We have agreed for an out-of-court settlement and the consortium has agreed to pay $230 million,"" Verma told reporters here.

OVL holds 20 per cent interest in Sakhalin-1 oil and gas fields and its share would be $46 million.

""We have already paid the money,"" he said.

ExxonMobil is the operator of the project with 30 per cent interest. Japan's SODECO has 30 percent interest and Rosneft the remaining 20 per cent.

Rosneft had demanded Rouble 89 billion from the consortium for oil that flowed to to Sakhalin-1 from its controlled Northern Chayvo oilfield.

OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had bought 20 per cent stake in 2001 for $1.7 billion. The project started production in 2005.

Since that time, the consortium has faithfully executed its obligations under the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) and the Russian government in 2017 extended the pact by a further 30 years, until 2051, he said.

In December 2011, Rosneft Oil Company was granted a Licence for the North Chayvo License area.

Effective August 2013, the Sakhalin-1 consortium and Rosneft entered into a Drilling Services Agreement, under which the consortium provided certain drilling services for the North Chayvo license to Rosneft Oil Company.

In September 2014, the Sakhalin-1 consortium and Rosneft Oil Company entered into a Production Handling Agreement, under which the Consortium provided certain production services for the North Chayvo license.

In June 2018, the consortium received ""Statement of Claim"" dated May 31, 2018 containing Rosneft allegation of ""unjust enrichment"" and demand of Rouble 89 billion from the consortium, he said adding Rosneft claimed compensation includes alleged damages for the period 2005-2011 during which Rosneft did not hold the North Chayvo license.",381,-0.8192186951637268

The government announced a 10 percent hike in price of domestic natural gas, a move that will translate into higher CNG price and increased cost of electricity and urea production.

Price paid to most of the domestic producers of natural gas has been hiked to $3.36 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) from October 1, from the current $3.06, according to Oil Ministry's Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.

Natural gas prices are set every six months based on average rates in gas-surplus nations like the US, Russia and Canada.

India imports half of its gas which costs more than double the domestic rate.

The $3.36 per mmBtu rate would be for six months beginning October 1 and will be the highest since October 2015 to March 2016 when $3.82 per mmBtu price was paid to domestic producers.

The increase in price will boost earnings of producers like Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Reliance Industries but will also lead to a rise in price of CNG, which uses natural gas as input. It would also lead to higher cost of urea and power production.

Gas price was last hiked to $3.06 per mmBtu for April-September 2018 from $2.89 in the previous six months. This was just the second hike in nearly three years.

The government also hiked the cap price based on alternate fuels for undeveloped gas finds in difficult areas like deep sea, which are unviable to develop as per the existing pricing formula.

The price for such fields would now be $7.67 per mmBtu for six month beginning October 1 as compared to $6.78 currently, PPAC said.

As per the new gas pricing formula approved by the NDA government in October 2014, gas prices are to be revised every six months.

The increase in natural gas prices will mean higher raw material cost for compressed natural gas (CNG) and natural gas piped to households (PNG). It would also mean higher feedstock cost for power generation and manufacturing of fertilisers and petrochemicals.

The hike will boost producers like ONGC. Every dollar increase in gas price results in Rs 4,000 crore additional revenue for the PSU on an annual basis, sources said.

ONGC is the country's biggest gas producer, accounting for two-thirds of the over 70 million standard cubic meters per day current output.

All of its gas as well as that of Oil India and private sector RIL's KG-D6 block are sold at the formula approved in October 2014. This formula, however, does not cover gas from fields like Panna/Mukta and Tapti in western offshore and Ravva in Bay of Bengal.

Indian gas prices are calculated by taking weighted average price at Henry Hub of the US, National Balancing Point of the UK, rates in Alberta (Canada) and Russia with a lag of one quarter.

As Brent crude crosses the $80/bbl mark, India is staring at a crude problem. Rising prices of crude oil will likely weigh on oil marketing companies such as IOC, BPCL and HPCL, especially in the backdrop of elections, analysts at CLSA have said in a report.

However, it sees Vedanta, GAIL and ONGC as good buy options based on factors such as favourable risk reward and lack of subsidy burden.

Assuming continuing depreciation in the rupee and rising spot crude prices, under-recoveries in FY19 for LPG and kerosene will rise 124 percent year-on-year to Rs 57,400 crore. For 4QFY18+9MFY19, under-recovery may stand at Rs 41,600 crore, which is double of budgeted oil subsidy amount (Rs 20,800 crore).

Under-recovery denotes notional losses that oil companies incur due to the difference between the price at which the oil marketing companies (OMCs) sell oil products like diesel, LPG & kerosene and the price which they should have received for meeting their cost of production,” according to Arthapedia, a portal for facilitating understanding of the Indian economy.

Even in a scenario where ONGC/OIL absorb the budgeted oil subsidy amount of Rs 20,800 crore, at spot crude/rupee price, the stocks will still not see further downside, analysts wrote in the research note.

In case of Gas Authority of India (GAIL), the up move in crude could make it raise spreads in its LPG production business and mean higher LNG trading margins.

“Spot crude/rupee from the second half of this fiscal could raise GAIL’s FY19/20 EPS (earnings per share) by 10/14%. Moreover, the firm also does not foresee any subsidy burden on GAIL.”

For Vedanta, CLSA noted that every USD 1 per barrel rise in crude price adds 0.9% to EPS and Rs 2.7 per share to its fair value. It sees Vedenta as another beneficiary of strong crude price.

Crude output to be hit

CLSA, in the report, also highlighted that crude production is set to take a hit, going forward. Factors at play are forced production cut by Iran due to sanctions and lower output from Venezuela.

“If we see this against the backdrop of below-average inventory levels and decade-low OPEC spare capacity, the market picture appears to be highly vulnerable to any further geopolitical disturbances which the oil market is prone to,” the report further added.

How are OMCs placed?

In this backdrop, OMCs such as IOC, BPCL and IOC may be take a hit ahead of elections in 2019.

Despite 5% spike in crude and 2% fall in rupee this month, average marketing margin on diesel and petrol will be slightly higher in 2QFY19 versus 1Q. Though this is still below long-term average margin, it underscores 5% rise in petrol/diesel price which OMCs have managed to take during second quarter.

So, the government has shown strong resolve in continuing with subsidy reforms. But in the upcoming six months, the government may see its toughest test as crude may spike further at the crucial time of elections and rising opposition on higher fuel price.

“The next six months could provide periods when marketing margins decline notably and raise doubts from investors. Although we believe diesel/petrol subsidies will not come back, these doubts will continue to hurt the stock performance of IOC, BPCL, and HPCL.”

In a regulatory filing, Engineers India Ltd (EIL) said its board of directors in a meeting Thursday ""considered the proposal for acquisition of 100 percent paid-up share capital of PDIL from President of India.""

The Board gave ""the approval of bidding for the same by way of Share Acquisition Route,"" it said. ""Other details cannot be disclosed due to confidentiality of the matter.""

The government in October last year invited bids from EIL or other similarly placed PSUs to buy out its 100 percent shareholding in consultancy firm PDIL.

Miniratna PSU Projects & Development India Ltd (PDIL) is under the administrative control of Chemical and Fertilizers Ministry.

""The Government of India has 'in-principle' decided to disinvest 100 percent of its shareholding in PDIL through strategic disinvestment with the transfer of management control to Engineers India Ltd (EIL) or other similar Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs),"" said the Preliminary Information Memorandum inviting Expression of Interest floated in October last year.

Earlier this year, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) acquired government's 51.11 percent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,915 crore. This had helped the government meet its sell-off (disinvestment) target for 2017-18 fiscal.

Founded in 1978, PDIL provides design engineering and consultancy services. It serves fertilizer and allied chemical industries, oil and gas sector, power and infrastructure sectors in India and internationally.

EIL too is the similar business. It however is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. Founded in 1965, it provides design, engineering, procurement, construction, and integrated project management services primarily for oil and gas and petrochemical industries.

In order to bring in efficiency in functioning of public sector undertakings, the government is pushing for merger of similarly placed firms. The Cabinet has approved the merger of SBI with its five associates.

There are six consultancy firms, which may merger into EIL to create a mega-consultancy firm. The firms are MECON, Telecommunications Consultants India (Ltd), Engineering Projects (India), WAPCOS and PDIL.

Rationale behind the move is that merger would help create a big company that can compete globally and put India on the global map of doing turnkey projects.

EIL is the biggest state-owned consultancy firm in the country which provides turnkey engineering solutions to projects in India and abroad.",423,0.9968033730983734

The government Wednesday approved fiscal incentives to attract investments and technology in raising oil and gas production from aging fields, which will unlock an estimated Rs 50 lakh crore of hydrocarbons in the next 20 years, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.

The government will charge half of the Rs 4,500 per tonne cess levied on oil produced from nominated fields of state-owned ONGC and Rajasthan block of private sector Vedanta Ltd through enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and improved oil recovery (IOR) projects.

For gas, a 75 percent discount in royalty would be given. ""Because of this, new investment and technology will come and Rs 50 lakh crore worth of production will increase in 10 years,"" the minister told a news conference here.

Conventional oil and gas fields see output decline and recovery rate drop as they age. To increase recovery rate, EOR and IOR schemes like polymer injection have to be implemented.

""Technological interventions have significant potential in stimulating the recovery of hydrocarbon reserves from the matured/aging fields.

""An increase by 5 percent in recovery rate of original in-place volume in oil production is envisaged producing 120 million tonnes of additional oil in next 20 years.

""In case of gas, an increase of 3 percent recovery rate on original in-place volume is envisaged, leading to additional production of 52 billion cubic metres of gas in next 20 years,"" he said.

The policy, having a sunset clause, will be effective for 10 years from the date of its notification. However, the fiscal incentives will be available for a period of 120 months from the date of commencement of production in such projects.

In case of improved recovery projects, the incentives will be available from the date of achievement of the prescribed benchmark. Defined timelines have been prescribed to complete the various processes under the policy.

Pradhan said the Union Cabinet approved a policy framework to promote and incentivise enhanced recovery (ER)/ improved recovery (IR)/ unconventional hydrocarbon (UHC) production methods/techniques to improve recovery factor of existing hydrocarbons reserves for augmenting domestic production of oil and gas.

The policy will be applicable to all contractual regimes and nomination fields.

""This policy initiative is expected to spur new investment, provide impetus to economic activities and generate additional employment opportunities. The policy is expected to facilitate induction of new, innovative and cutting-edge technology and forging technological collaboration to improve the productivity of existing fields,"" he said.

Commenting on the decision, Vedanta Ltd's CEO for Oil and Gas Sudhir Mathur said the move would spur the growth of Indian oil and gas industry.

""This policy will attract much-needed investments, and usher in a wave of best-in-class technologies to improve India's hydrocarbons recovery,"" he said.

While ER includes enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and enhanced gas recovery (EGR), unconventional hydrocarbon (UHC) production methods include shale oil and gas production, tight oil and gas production, production from oil shale, gas hydrates and heavy oil.

ER, IR and exploration and exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons are capital intensive, technologically complex and challenging in nature. They call for supporting infrastructure, logistic support, fiscal incentives and enabling environment, Pradhan said.",527,0.7379519542058309

The Director General of Hydrocarbons Wednesday said the ongoing Discovered Small Filed (DSF) second round bidding, once completed, will entice about $1.2 billion worth of investments by the successful bidders.

""The total investment committed in the DSF-I was $600 million. We expect it to double this time at least double to $1200 million ($1.2 billion). Here the area is also doubled and reserves are also doubled 9 when compared to the round one). The area is 3000 Sq Km and reserves are 190 mmtoe ( million metric tonnes of oil equivalent),"" VP Joy, Director General of Directorate of Hydrocarbons told reporters.

He was in the city to participate in the investor meet organised by the DGH for the DSF Bid Round-II. He said under the current round 25 contract areas covering 59 discovered oil and gas fields spread over 3000 Sq Km with prospective resource base of over 190 mmtoe was announced.

The e-bidding portal was open since August 9 and would continue till December 18. The government had in 2016 brought a new DSF policy, offering ""idle"" small discovered fields of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) in an auction on liberalised terms including marketing and pricing freedom and lower taxes.

In the first round of bidding for DSF last year, 134 bids were received for 34 blocks out of 46 on offer. Joy said within this financial year the contracts would be awarded to the successful bidders who were supposed to start production within three years after being awarded the contract.

""The successful bidder will get the Petroleum Mining Lease on their name. They will have to submit the field development plan. Then drill the wells and start the production. As per the terms and conditions they will have to start production within three years after they were awarded,"" he explained.

Replying to a query on the National Seismic Programme, he said the government has earmarked Rs 3000 crore for the purpose and about Rs 1000 crore was spent on that. Joy said the processed data pertaining to Mahanadi Basin has already been published and about 60 percent of the data has been acquired.

""Rajasthan data we are hoping to display next month,"" he said.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has made oil and gas discoveries in Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal that may potentially open up two new sedimentary basins in the country, the firm's director for exploration has said.

ONGC had previously opened six out of India's seven producing basins for commercial production. It is in the process of adding the eighth by putting Kutch offshore on the oil and gas map of India.

""The seventh basin was opened way back in 1985. We are looking at adding three more basins in next five years time,"" ONGC Director (Exploration) Ajay Kumar Dwivedi said.

The firm has found gas deposits in a block in Vindhyan basin in Madhya Pradesh that is now being tested, he said adding that the find is at 3,000-plus meters.

ONGC has drilled four wells after the discovery and will now hydro-frack it by the end of the year to test commerciality of the finds.

Similarly, an oil and gas discovery has been made in a well in Ashok Nagar of 24 Parganas district in West Bengal, he said adding that one lakh cubic meters per day of gas flowed from one object that was tested.

Now, the firm would go for appraisal of the find, only after which commercially exploitable reserves could be established.

Dwivedi said the company is on the way to putting the Kutch offshore discovery to production. This would make Kutch India's eighth sedimentary basin. Cauvery was the last Category-I producing basin which was discovered in 1985.

ONGC had made a significant natural gas discovery in the Gulf of Kutch off the west coast a few months back, which it plans to bring to production in 2-3 years, he said.

India has 26 sedimentary basins, of which only seven have commercial production of oil and gas. Except for the Assam shelf, ONGC opened up for commercial production all the other six basins, including Cambay, Mumbai Offshore, Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari, Cauvery, and Assam-Arakan Fold Belt.

The discovery in Kutch offshore may hold about one trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.

The spread of Kutch offshore basin covers an area of 28,000 square kilometers in water depth of up to 200 meters and will become eighth producing basin of the country.

He, however, said in order to monetise the discoveries in the three new basins, ""a favourable fiscal regime and concessions"" are needed.

This, because the current gas price of $3.06 per million British thermal unit, is ""challenging"", he said adding the discoveries in a tight reservoir, where the cost of production is higher.

Cambay, Mumbai Offshore, Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari, Cauvery, Assam Shelf and Assam-Arakan Fold Belt are Category-I basins with established commercial production.

Category-II basins Kutch, Mahanadi-NEC (North East Coast), Andaman-Nicobar, Kerala-Konkan-Lakshadweep where known accumulation of hydrocarbons are there but no commercial production has been achieved so far.

Himalayan Foreland Basin, Ganga Basin, Vindhyan basin, Saurashtra Basin, Kerela Konkan Basin, Bengal Basin are Category-III basins having hydrocarbon shows that are considered geologically prospective.",508,-0.727527916431427

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone for the 9-million tonne or 1.8 lakh bpd greenfield refinery at Pachpadra village in Barmer district of Rajasthan being set up in a 75:25 joint venture with the state administration. It is slated to be completed by end-2020.

The foundation stone for the project was first laid in September 2013 by the then president of ruling Congress Sonia Gandhi.

But the project remained a non-starter as the state, which voted in a BJP government, reworked the project and changed incentive structure including an interest-free loan of 16,845 crore to HPCL to be paid back in 15 years from the commissioning of the project.

The company, taken over by upstream energy major ONGC this January for a tad over Rs 36,915 crore as part of the governments divestment process, has around 24.8 million tonne (mt) refining capacity now. It has plans to ramp this up to 60 mt by 2030 and brownfield expansion to achieve the target is afoot with work.

Currently, HPCL is expanding the capacity at its flagship Mumbai refinery from 6.5 mt to 9.5 mtpa at a cost of over Rs 5,000 crore, and the Visakhapatnam refinery from 8.3 mt to 15 mt at a cost of around Rs 21,000 crore.

That apart, it also has a 9 mt facility at Bathinda in Punjab in a 49 per cent equal joint venture Mittal Energy of LN Mittal which will be doubled in a few years.

""We are working to award the licensor agreements to 10 of the 12 vendors we need for the Barmer refinery this week. Already a lot civil work is progressing. Since the foundation stone was laid in January, we've invested close to Rs 6,000 crore in civil work.

""A water reservoir is almost complete and so are many other basic civil structures,"" M K Surana, chairman and managing director, said here over the weekend.

He declined to name the licensors citing confidentiality agreements and the sensitivity of the work they will perform for the third largest state-run oil marketer.

At the AGM last Thursday, Surana had announced a Rs 75,000 crore capital expansion for the next five years, most of which will go into capacity ramp up. For the current fiscal, the company has a capex plan of Rs 8,425 crore, most of which will go into the ongoing brownfield expansion at Vizag and Mumbai.

Giving a break-up of the Rs 75,000 crore capex, Surana said of this, Rs 33,300 crore is earmarked for refinery expansion, Rs 29,550 crore for marketing, around Rs 770 crore for renewables and R&D, and Rs 12,000 crore for joint ventures.

He also said the company is focused on enhancing refinery footprint to increase self-sufficiency (it buys a lot of fuel from other refiners as it sells much more than (36.9 mt last fiscal) what it refines (24.8 mt), diversify into profitable segments like petrochemicals, expand refining and marketing businesses into new geographies and also enter the high margin natural gas distribution.

HPCL will also have 12.5 per cent consideration in the proposed 60 mt Ratnagiri refinery in Maharashtra if it materialises.

Additionally, Surana said the company is in discussions with the parent ONGC and Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals (which is majority owned by ONGC) for a merger. HPCL owns 17 per cent stake in MRPL while ONGC holds a majority 71.63 per cent.

""Eventually it makes no sense for ONGC to run two separate companies in the same business. A merger can bring greater synergy and economies of scale to us, while we have a little over 15,000 fuel outlets, MRPL has just six of them.

""The way it has been set up makes it difficult for them to open more retail outlets as well,"" Surana said.

He further said that with MRPL, they can unload crude at Mangalore and get freight advantage.

""We have a large R&D facility in Mangalore set up at a cost of Rs 3,000 crore. We have refinery in Vizag on the East Coast, Mumbai on the West Coast, Bathinda in the North and Mangalore in the South. If we merge we can integrate facilities and create lots of synergies,"" he added.

But he refused to offer a timeline for the merger, saying ""three boards are involved. We are in discussions with ONGC and we are progressing well.""

The Barmer refinery at Pachpadra will be able to process local crude from Vedantas Barmer oil field, apart from imported crude oil. Of the 9 mt capacity, 2 mt will house a petrochemicals complex. The state has allotted 4,800 acre for the refinery, which was conceived by the Manmohan Singh government in late 2012.

Surana said the Barmer refinery project is on course will be able to commission it as planned2022-22.

When asked about fund raising for the project, finance director J Ramaswamy told PTI that the project will have Rs 28,000 crore of debt on their book, which will be raised from next fiscal. ""We will have financial closure by next fiscal when we will need the money,"" he said.

India's annual refining capacity today stands at 235 mt. Of this, 194 mt are consumed domestically. The country is in the process of increasing the refining capacity to around 310 mt by 2023 to become a refinery hub.

The market leader Indian Oil alone will have 140 mt tonne capacity by then when domestic demand for petrol and diesel is expected to go up by two-thirds to 170 billion litres.",947,0.5556384523709615

Entities willing to buy the government's 51 percent stake in Pawan Hans will have the option not to purchase the remaining stake held by ONGC in the helicopter service provider.

Responding to queries raised by bidders, the government clarified today that existing interested bidders need not resubmit their bids for Pawan Hans, which has a fleet of 46 choppers.

""In case the successful bidder decides not to exercise this option of buying ONGC stake or ONGC is unable to sell its stake due to any unforeseen events, then ONGC will continue as a shareholder in PHL and the successful bidder would have to execute a Shareholders' Agreement with ONGC,"" it said.

Earlier this month, the government had issued an addendum to the Expression of Interest (EoI) for sale of Pawan Hans Ltd (PHL) and invited bids from entities saying that along with government's 51 per cent stake, the bidders will also have the option to buy ONGC stake of 49 percent in the company.

The last date for submission of bids is September 12.

Fresh bids were invited after ONGC board in July decided to combine its 49 per cent stake in the offer for sale by government of India.

""While ONGC has provided unconditional and irrevocable commitment to sell its shares, the successful bidder shall have the option to buy ONGC stake of 49 per cent in PHL,"" it said.

On April 13, the government had issued the information memorandum for the 51 per cent strategic stake sale in Pawan Hans and had sought EoI from interested bidders by June 18. About half a dozen bidders are believed to have submitted bids.

To a query on whether existing bidders would be required to resubmit their bids following the addendum issued, the government said, ""resubmission by the existing IBs (interested bidders) is not compulsory if the IB does not want to make any change in the EoI submitted"".

The IB has to submit a letter stating that ""EoI and subsequent clarifications submitted by them shall continue to remain valid for 180 days from September 12, 2018, or such date as many be extended,"" it added.

The ONGC-run Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) today said it will invest around Rs 75,000 crore towards capex over the next five years, of which around Rs 8,425 crore will be invested this financial year.

Most of the capex will be spent on capacity expansion both in greenfield and brownfield projects, the company chairman and managing director M K Surana told reporters at a post AGM press meet this evening.

""We have lined up capex plans of Rs 75,000 crore for the next five years. On an average we have been investing around Rs 6,000 crore per annum in capital expenditure. But during the current fiscal we are investing Rs 8,425 crore as we are coasting along to complete the expansion of our capacities at Vizag and Mumbai refineries at a faster clip,"" the chairman said.

Owing to numerous geopolitical factors, crude prices went up steadily during the June quarter, and remained steady between $70 and $79 per barrel.

This uptick favoured upstream oil companies, whose realisations improved as a result. A parallel upward revision in gas prices ensured higher realisations for gas upstream companies as well.

While a rise in crude prices is good for these companies' revenues, it also exposes them to a risk of sharing subsidy with the government in prices rise further.

ONGC

Thanks to higher crude prices, ONGC reported a 43 percent year-on-year rise in realisations for the June quarter. The company's EBITDA margin expanded by a healthy 390 basis points.

After the acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, which consumed a substantial portion of ONGC's surplus cash, its other income came in lower than in the same quarter last year.

Also, the debt that the company had to take onto its books for the deal ensured that its interest outgo also rose substantially in the quarter under review.

A rise in other expenses to the tune of around Rs 90 crore because of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates also ate into the company's profitability.

ONGC's oil production for the quarter, at 6.2 million tonnes, was 4 percent lower YoY and nearly unchanged on sequentially. Its gas production, at 6.2 billion cubic metres, was up 3 percent YoY and 2 percent sequentially.

With several new projects starting up around H2FY19, the ONGC management remained confident of ending the year with positive growth in oil production.

It also indicated that at the prevalent crude price levels, no subsidy burden is expected to come ONGC's way in FY19, which is a relief. However, investors need to stay cautious in a buoyant oil price environment.

Oil India

Oil India reported a 45 percent YoY rise in revenue and a 61 percent YoY increase in EBITDA, primarily because of higher realisations.

The benefit of higher realisations was partially offset by higher other expenses (including a Rs 10 crore charge on account of forex loss), which rose 64 percent on year.

Lower other income coupled with higher interest and tax cost ate away at Oil India's net profit. The company's net profit margin expanded 400 basis points on year.

The company's production remained largely muted, which we see as a concern in coming months. Oil sale volumes were down 0.9 percent YoY to 0.81 million tonnes and gas sale volumes were largely flat at 0.6 billion cubic metres.

Outlook

After correcting 18 percent and 19 percent, respectively, from their 52-week highs, shares of ONGC and Oil India are now trading at multiples of 7.1 times and and 7.3 times their estimated earnings for 2019.

Given the overall momentum in crude oil prices, we expect both companies to be comfortable as far as revenue is concerned.

While oil volumes are expected to remain more or less flat, owing to the increased stress on cleaner fuels, with the uptrend of crude prices we expect improved realisations and a rise in volumes of gas. The parallel price rise in gas should have rub-off positively on overall realisations.

However, we advise investors to keep their eyes open for a situation in which crude prices rise further, increasing the subsidy sharing burden for companies like ONGC.

We see a steady topline for both Oil India and ONGC and recommend to keep both companies on the radar. At current levels, we see ONGC as a good pick to include in the portfolio. However, we would be looking for a better entry point for Oil India.Follow @Ruchiagrawal

Mining mogul Anil Agarwal led Vedanta Ltd has bagged 41 out of 55 oil and gas exploration blocks offered in India's maiden open acreage auction, upstream regulator DGH said today. State-owned Oil India Ltd won nine blocks, while Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) managed to win just two.

State gas utility GAIL, upstream arm of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Oil Exploration Co (HOEC) received one block each, DGH said giving out list of winners of Open Acreage licensing Policy (OALP) round-1.

Vedanta, which had put in bids for all the 55 blocks, won right to explore and produce oil and gas in 41 of them.

We will work hard to make the best of this opportunity. We are an energy deficient country and policies like OALP will help reduce country's import dependence for oil from around 80 percent now to 67 percent by 2022, in line with (the) PM's vision.

""The development further strengthens our vision to invest in India and contribute 50 percent of India's domestic crude oil production. In keeping with our values and ethos, we will continue to focus on sustainability and development expertise for people and communities to enhance lives,"" Agarwal said.

At the close of the bidding on May 2, ONGC had bid for 37 blocks either on its own or in consortium with other state-owned firms. OIL bid for 22 blocks in a similar fashion.

Vedanta was the sole bidder for two blocks and had either ONGC or OIL as a direct competitor in the remaining. Except for the two blocks that received three bids each, all the other 53 had just two bidders.

Neither local giants Reliance Industries nor any foreign company participated in the auction, a first since India began offering oil and gas area for exploration and production through bids in 1999.

India had in July last year allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bringing about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration.

Under this policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest (EoI) for prospecting of oil and gas in an area that is presently not under any production or exploration license.

The EoIs can be put in any time of the year but they are accumulated twice annually.

As many as 55 blocks were sought for prospecting of oil and gas by prospective bidders, mostly by state-owned explorers, ONGC and OIL, and private sector Vedanta by the end of the first EoI cycle on November 15, 2017, official sources said.

The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage.

The 55 blocks have a total area of 59,282 sq km. This compares to about 1,02,000 sq km being under exploration currently, they said.

Blocks are awarded to the company which offers highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells.

Increased exploration will lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world's third largest oil importer to cut import dependence.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of cutting oil import bill by 10 per cent to 67 per cent by 2022 and to half by 2030. Import dependence has increased since 2015 when Modi had set the target. India currently imports 81 per cent of its oil needs.

The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block.

The government till now has been selecting and demarcating areas it feels can be offered for bidding in an exploration licensing round.

So far 256 blocks had been offered for exploration and production since 2000. The last bid round happened in 2010. Of these, 254 blocks were awarded. But as many as 156 have already been relinquished due to poor prospect.",720,0.6342297494411469

The Indian government has asked its biggest state owned firm, Oil and Natural Gas, to list its overseas unit ONGC Videsh, according to a letter seen.

The move to float the unit which has investments in 11 producing assets in countries including Russia, Brazil and Iran is part of a government push to sell state-assets to raise funds.

A listing would also help unlock value in the unit by improving its corporate governance and efficiency, the letter from the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management to ONGC said.

The letter, sent last week, did not state how much of ONGC should be offered to outside investors. The letter said any state owned firm with a positive net worth and no accumulated loss should be listed to unlock value.

The listing would help the government meet its divestment targets and make up for a failed plan earlier this year to sell a stake in national carrier Air India.

The Narendra Modi-led government has a target to raise a record 1 trillion rupees ($14.25 billion) from the sale of state assets in the current fiscal year ending in March 2019.

India holds a 67.45 percent stake in ONGC Videsh's parent ONGC and gains from a listing could be transferred to the government via a special dividend.

ONGC Videsh, 100 percent owned by ONGC, suffered losses during the low crude price environment between 2014 and 2017 but its earnings have since recovered. The firm posted a net profit of $152 million and contributed 5 percent to ONGC's overall net earnings in the latest fiscal year ended March 2018.

Oil & Natural Gas Corporation share price rallied 4 percent intraday Monday after reports of likely proposal for IPO of company's foreign subsidiary.

Sources told CNBC-TV18 that the government proposed an initial public offering for ONGC Videsh.

Finance ministry has written to oil ministry w.r.t ONGC Videsh IPO, saying the listing of ONGC Videsh will add value to ONGC, sources said.

ONGC Videsh, the wholly owned subsidiary and overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, is a Miniratna Schedule 'A' Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) of the Government of India under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas

The primary business of ONGC Videsh is to prospect for oil and gas acreages outside India, including exploration, development and production of oil and gas. ONGC Videsh owns participating interests in 38 oil and gas assets in 17 countries and produced about 23.4 percent of oil and 18.9 percent of India’s domestic oil and natural gas production respectively in FY17.

Sudan wants India's ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) to withdraw arbitration proceedings against the African nation as it is making efforts to mitigate default on payment of dues, OVL said in a statement on Friday.

OVL, the foreign acquisition unit of Oil and Natural Gas Corp's (ONGC), filed an arbitration claim earlier this year against the government of Sudan in a London court seeking to recover dues pending for years from a project hit by the breakaway of South Sudan in 2011.

Earlier this week, a Sudanese delegation including its finance and foreign affairs minister met ONGC officials seeking withdrawal of the arbitration proceedings.

OVL, however, said it would continue with the arbitration process and work simultaneously with Sudan to find out a suitable mechanism of resolving the issues.

At the centre of the dispute is ONGC's 25 percent stake that the company had acquired in the Greater Nile Oil Project (GNOP) in Sudan in 2003. Other stakeholders include China's China National Petroleum with a 40 percent stake and Malaysia's Petronas with a 30 percent share.",185,-0.623663604259491

India's crude oil import bill is likely to jump by about $26 billion in 2018-19 as rupee dropping to a record low has made buying of oil from overseas costlier, government officials said today.

Besides, the rupee hitting a record low of 70.32 to a US dollar in the opening deal today will also lead to a hike in the retail selling price of petrol, diesel and cooking gas (LPG).

India, which imports over 80 percent of its oil needs, spent $87.7 billion (Rs 5.65 lakh crore) on importing 220.43 million tonne (MT) of crude oil in 2017-18. For 2018-19, the imports are pegged at almost 227 MT.

""We at the beginning of the financial year estimated that crude oil import bill will be around $108 billion (Rs 7.02 lakh crore) at an average crude oil price of $65 per barrel and exchange rate of Rs 65 per dollar,"" an official said.

But the exchange rate has been at an average of Rs 67.6 till August 14. If the rupee is to stay around 70 per dollar for the rest of the ongoing fiscal, the oil import bill will be $114 billion, he said.

The rupee has been among the worst performing currencies in Asia, witnessing 8.6 percent slump this year. Fanned by a higher oil import bill, India's trade deficit, or the gap between exports and imports, in July widened to $18 billion, the most in more than five years.

Trade shortfall puts pressure on the current account deficit (CAD), a key vulnerability for the economy. Rupee depreciation will result in higher earnings for exporters as well as domestic oil producers like Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) who bill refiners in US dollar terms.

But this would result in rise in petrol and diesel prices, with full impact likely to be visible later this month.

""Though oil firms fix retail selling price of petrol and diesel on a daily basis, the inputs for that fixation are an average of previous fortnight. So today's rate is based on average benchmark of international oil prices and the exchange rate of August 1-15.

""And since the rupee in the beginning of the month was at 68.3 to 68.6 a dollar, the exact impact of today's depreciation is not visible,"" he said. Prices of petrol and diesel were today hiked by 6 paise a litre each to Rs 77.20 and Rs 68.78, respectively in Delhi. Rates are highest in two months.

Fuel prices in Delhi are the cheapest in all metros and most state capitals due to lower sales tax or VAT. If oil prices continue at these levels and rupee at 70 a dollar, retail rates should go up by 50-60 paisa a litre.

Petrol price had touched an all time high of Rs 78.43 a litre on May 29 and had since receded. On that day, the diesel price had touched an all-time high of Rs 69.30.

State owned oil firms had in mid-June last year dumped 15 year practice of revising rates on 1st and 16th of every month in favour of daily price revisions.",517,0.12429288625717164

The government has notified a new policy requiring state owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) to pay royalty and cess tax only to the extent of their equity holding in certain pre-1999 oil and gas fields.

The 'Policy Framework for Streamlining the Working of Production Sharing Contracts in respect of Pre-NELP and NELP Blocks' was notified in the Gazette of India yesterday, according to the Gazette notification.

Till now ONGC and OIL had to pay 100 per cent royalty and cess tax on 11 pre-New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) fields that were given to private firms prior to 1999.

The government had awarded some discovered oil and gas fields to private firms in the 1990s with a view to attracting investments in the country.

To incentivise such investments, the liability of payment of statutory levies like royalty and cess was put on state owned firms, who were made licensees of the blocks. ONGC and Oil India Ltd were allowed right to back in or take an interest of 30-40 percent in the fields, but were liable to pay 100 per cent of the statutory levies.

The new rule, which last month approved by the Cabinet, will apply to 11 fields like Dholka field in Gujarat that is operated by Joshi Oil and Gas. It will also apply to Hindustan Oil Exploration Company (HOEC)-operated PY-1 field in Cauvery basin.

""In pre-NELP exploration blocks, the National Oil Companies, as Licensee are liable for payment of royalty, cess and other statutory charges on entire production of oil and gas.

""To facilitate further investments, the Government has decided that the contractors in pre-NELP exploration blocks will be allowed to share the liability of the statutory levies including royalty, cess and any other charges in proportion to their respective participating interests (PIs) in the block,"" the notification said.

All the constituents of the blocks would become licensees and payments made towards such statutory levies shall be eligible for cost recovery. It means that like capital and operating expense, the statutory levies can now be first recovered from the sale of hydrocarbons before sharing the profits with the government.

These are the same conditions that ONGC had insisted upon in 2010 when Vedanta bought Cairn Energy plc's 70 percent stake in the prolific Barmer basin oil block in Rajasthan. ONGC, which held 30 percent stake in the block, gave approval to the deal only when Vedanta agreed to pay royalty and cess on its 70 percent share.

Royalty for onland block is presently 20 percent. An equivalent amount of cess is also levied.

Also, the notification extended the time period given to oil and gas companies to develop hydrocarbon blocks in the northeast. Production from these blocks will be linked to market prices of natural gas.

It also extended tax benefits under Section 42 of Income Tax, 1961 prospectively to operational blocks under pre-NELP discovered fields for the extended period of the contract.

Section 42 of Income Tax allows the companies to claim 100 percent of expenditure incurred under a production sharing contract (PSC) as tax deductible for computing taxable income in the same year.

While signing PSC of pre-NELP discovered fields, 13 contracts out of 28 contracts did not have provision for tax benefit under Section 42 of Income-tax Act. Now, this will bring uniformity and consistency in PSCs and provide an incentive to the contractor to make an additional investment during the extended period of PSC, it said.

The approvals given are expected to help in ensuring the expeditious development of hydrocarbon resources.",606,0.9943414330482483

The government is considering the listing of state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on an overseas exchange, sources told CNBC-TV18.

The company could be listed in Singapore or the London Stock Exchange. This move will grant ONGC a better access to funds and provide it with a global platform.

The government will position ONGC as India’s largest oil and gas exploration and production company. It may also look at foreign listing as an option for more such big public sector units (PSUs), sources added.

ONGC already holds a stake in 41 oil and gas projects across the world via ONGC’s overseas investment arm ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL). The government was keen on listing OVL as well in 2015, to raise funds for foreign acquisitions, but the move was put on hold then, as the company was looking to increase its assets. There was also a slump in global crude prices.

Virtually rejecting ONGC's demand, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) has said it is acting as per its understanding of the statute in not recognising the new majority shareholder as its promoter. Whatever we are doing, whatever we have done and whatever we will be doing will be as per our understanding of the statute and the guidelines and Companies Act and the SEBI guidelines.

""Beyond that who is interpreting whatever, it is his understanding of the situation. We need not subscribe to that,"" HPCL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Kumar Surana told reporters here. He was asked about ONGC seeking recognition as the promoter of the company post acquisition of majority stake in HPCL.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had in January this year bought the government's entire 51.11 percent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore. Post that, HPCL had become a subsidiary of ONGC.

But HPCL in its regulatory filing to the stock exchanges, the latest being on July 12, still lists 'President of India' as the promoter with 'zero' percent shareholding. ONGC, on the other hand, is listed under 'Public Shareholder'.

ONGC has written to HPCL management asking it to take steps to rectify the filings to reflect the true promoter of the company. Asked about ONGC's request, Surana said, ""Everybody is free to express their views. Our actions will be guided by what we think is right.""

Since ONGC takeover in January, HPCL has made two stock exchange filings about the shareholding pattern of the company the first on April 20 and then on July 12. In both, ONGC is shown as the public shareholder and President of India listed as the promoter.

Sources said ONGC feels the HPCL management is bound to take corrective action to reflect the true picture. According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India's rules, the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company.

When Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had bought government's stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd, it was listed as the latter's promoter in every instance after the deal. The same was the case when IOC acquired a majority stake in Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd (CPCL).

Surana has retained the title of Chairman and Managing Director despite corporate governance structure require a group having just one chairman and subsidiaries being run by managing directors and CEOs.

ONGC's overseas subsidiary, ONGC Videsh Ltd, is headed by a Managing Director and CEO. Its refinery subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), which is listed on BSE, too is led by a Managing Director and CEO. ONGC Chairman is the head of boards of both the companies.

Since acquiring a majority stake in HPCL, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board. ONGC has appointed its Director (Finance) Subhash Kumar to HPCL board. He has replaced Sushma Taishete Rath, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.

Prior to this, HPCL had two government nominee directors Rath and Sandeep Poundrik, Joint Secretary (Refineries) of the Oil Ministry. After the appointment of Kumar, there remains only one government nominee director on HPCL board.",574,

The board of ONGC has, for the second time in just over a month, approved selling its entire 49 percent stake in helicopter service provider Pawan Hans alongside government's privatisation bid, officials with direct knowledge of the development said.

ONGC board had first on June 29 approved exiting Pawan Hans and its interest being clubbed with the 51 percent government stake that is already on offer for sale.

Officials said ONGC on July 2 wrote to the government communicating the decision of the board but the Department of Disinvestment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which is managing the sale of government stake, sought certain clarifications from the company.

Among others, ONGC was asked to state if the terms on which government stake sale is being sold would be acceptable to it. The company board at its meeting on August 2 endorsed such terms, they said.

This now paves way for the government to make a revised offer to sell 100 percent stake in Pawan Hans.

DIPAM, which floated the offer for sale for government's 51 percent stake in Pawan Hans twice in the last 10 months, is likely to issue an amended expression of interest (EoI) shortly.

Officials said ONGC is of the view that its investment in Pawan Hans is no longer strategic as it charter hires helicopters to ferry staff to its oil and gas locations, mostly offshore, through competitive bidding.

Of the 22 helicopters it currently has on hire, just seven or less than a third are from Pawan Hans.Pawan Hans owns a fleet of 46 helicopters.

ONGC board wants to consolidate business and focus resources on core oil and gas exploration and production business and not scatter bandwidth of management in unrelated businesses, they said.

Officials said when the government had first floated an offer to sell its 51 percent stake in October last year, ONGC made an offer to DIPAM that its 49 percent stake be also sold on same terms.

At that time, the company was told to get its board approval. Meanwhile, the government in early April withdrew its offer for sale as only two bidders including Indian helicopter major Global Vectra Helicorp and US-based Continental Helicopters made an offer.

A revised offer for sale was floated later that month, which fetched about half a dozen bidders.

DIPAM is of the view that a revised offer for sale would have to be floated as some bidders may have been deterred by 51 percent stake and would now prefer to bid when 100 percent is being offered.

Pawan Hans operates seven Dauphin N3 Helicopters for ONGC's offshore operations. These helicopters, based at Juhu airport, Mumbai and Rajahmundry, undertake passenger crew change service and production trips on a regular basis to meet the offshore requirements of the state-owned oil and gas producer.",488,-0.9956890940666199

Oil and Natural Gas Corp's (ONGC) highest ever pre-tax quarterly profit (EBITDA) provides cash flow to the state-owned firm to reduce borrowings, Moody's Investors Service said today. For the April-June quarter of the current fiscal, ONGC reported 47.2 percent increase in EBITDA or operating profit to Rs 14,240 crore.

""The increase in EBITDA was largely driven by higher crude oil prices, as well as the depreciation of the Indian rupee,"" Moody's said.

In a report, the global rating firm said the government has decided against asking ONGC to share in the cost of any fuel subsidies. ""If it had done so, such a request could have partly negated the impact of the increase in oil prices.""

The government's decision, it said, is credit positive because it provides ONGC with cash flow to reduce its borrowings.

ONGC increased its borrowings by about Rs 25,000 crore in January 2018, when it acquired a 51.11 percent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd for Rs 36,915 crore.

""If oil prices stay above $70 per barrel for the remainder of the year and the government refrains from asking ONGC to share the costs of any fuel subsidies, we expect ONGC to generate a consolidated free cash flow of more than Rs 20,000 crore after likely capital spending of Rs 30,000 crore and dividend payments of Rs 9,500 crore. The company could reduce part of its acquisition debt by using this free cash flow,"" it said.

The high levels of free cash flow will improve ONGC's financial flexibility, especially at a time when the company is unlikely to reduce its borrowings by selling its 13.77 percent stake in Indian Oil Corp (IOC), given that the share prices of IOC have fallen by about 25 per cent since September 1, 2017.

ONGC's 13.77 percent stake in IOCL is currently valued at Rs 22,500 crore.

Moody's said the government could, however, ask ONGC to share fuel subsidies in the next few quarters or alternatively, look for higher dividends.

""Any such move by the government would constrain ONGC's free cash flow and debt reduction, which will be credit negative,"" it said.

The rating agency in its base case assumed an average oil price for the remainder of the year of between $45 and $65 per barrel and expects ONGC to maintain retained cash flow/net debt above 30 percent.

Debt reduction from free cash flow generation because of high oil prices and the absence of subsidy sharing will provide the company with a buffer to absorb declines in oil prices, it said.

While ONGC has only reported standalone financial results, its consolidated EBITDA — which includes the results of ONGC Videsh Ltd, ONGC's international exploration and production business — will also benefit from the increase in oil prices.

However, the refining businesses of the company (HPCL and Mangalore Refining and Petrochemical Ltd) will likely report weaker earnings for Q1 2019 versus Q4 2018 because regional refining margins were lower by about USD 1 per barrel, Moody's added.",507,0.5311680833498637

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) today said it has plugged a gas leakage on an unmanned offshore installation in Mumbai High South oil and gas field, around 180-km off the Mumbai coast.

The gas leakage was observed in one of the unmanned wellhead platforms S1-6, the company said in a statement without saying when the leak was detected.

""A team of ONGC engineers with support from Indian Navy successfully plugged the gas leakage,"" it said.

Mumbai High is the ONGC's top oil and gas producing asset, lying in a water depth of 75 metres in the Arabian Sea.

The field, which started production in 1974, is divided into two -- Mumbai High North and Mumbai High South.

ONGC said after the leak was detected, the platform team immediately initiated all remote actions to shut down the well platform and to bleed off the pressure in the pipelines. Fire-fighting vessels were instantly deployed near the platform to provide water blanketing by continuously spraying water.

ONGC said its team could not land on the unmanned facility by helicopter or be transferred by a multi-support vessel due to bad weather conditions with high wind speeds of up to 35 knots, swell of 3.5 metres and strong surface currents in the sea.

""Having exhausted all available options to transfer ONGC team to S1-6 Platform, ONGC approached Indian Navy for help. After detailed discussions between ONGC and Indian Navy, it was decided to winch down ONGC team with the help of Indian Navy commandos,"" it said.

The government has moved Delhi High Court to enforce a USD 3.8 billion recovery from Reliance Industries, Shell and ONGC following an English court ruling over its share from the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields in western offshore, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said today.

The liability is to be split between the three companies in proportion to their stake in the fields. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has 40 percent interest while RIL and Shell hold 30 percent each.

In a written reply in Rajya Sabha, Pradhan said that based on the Final Partial Award (FPA) dated October 12, 2016, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had on May 25, 2017, raised demand for USD 3.8 billion on ONGC, RIL and Shell towards government of India share of profit petroleum and royalty.

RIL and Shell challenged the FPA before the High Court in London. ONGC was not party to the arbitration.

""The High Court, London rejected the petition filed by RIL and Shell on April 16, 2018, except on one issue which was remanded to the Arbitral Tribunal,"" he said. ""For enforcement of the FPA, Government has filed a petition before the Delhi High Court.""

In December 2010, BG Exploration & Production India Ltd, which was subsequently acquired by Shell, and RIL, initiated an arbitration against the Government of India (GoI) after a dispute over the state's share of profit and royalty from Panna-Mukta and Mid and South Tapti contract areas off the west coast.

The Arbitration Tribunal gave its FPA on October 12, 2016. RIL and Shell initiated proceedings under English Arbitration Act 1996 to challenge the arbitration award before the English Commercial Court in November 2016.

On May 2, 2018, the Court delivered its final judgment, remitting a significant issue for redetermination by the Tribunal within three months while disposing of eight other issues, RIL had said on May 24.

The Arbitration Tribunal has scheduled a hearing to determine the remitted issue and will thereafter deliver an award, it had said.

It had insisted that before taking up the issue of quantification of liability, the Tribunal has to decide the issue which is remitted by the English court to it.

BG-RIL propose to file an application to the Tribunal for the increase of Cost Recovery Limit which they are entitled to do under the Production Sharing Contracts.

""Tribunal can consider the issue of quantification of liability (if any) only after these two issues are decided,"" RIL had said. ""Several issues relating to the claim made by GOI are subject to pending arbitration proceedings.""

Pradhan said out of the four arbitration initiated by RIL in respect of its Krishna Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6, only two are under adjudication.

The firm has withdrawn the arbitration against a delay in notifying a gas price and the one against taking away of some area in the KG-D6 block after the expiry of stipulated timeframe.

The arbitrations under adjudication include one against the government disallowing certain costs for KG-D6 output not meeting the targets because of non-drilling of stipulated wells, he said.

The second arbitration is against the government seeking compensation from RIL and its partners for producing natural gas belonging to state-owned ONGC, he added.

With global crude prices shooting up on account of sanctions on Iranian crude and other extraneous factors, state-owned firms are investing heavily in enhancing distribution channels, refining facilities, exploration and production to capitalize on the parallel rise in demand and prices.

Oil firms have already spent Rs 17,544 crore in the first quarter of the present financial year, almost a fifth of their total planned capital expenditure for the 12 months ending March 2019.

Indain Oil Corporation (IOCL), the country's largest retailer, spent Rs 5,852 crore, the most among all Indian refiners. This amounts to a quarter of the company's capex target for the financial year.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation invested Rs 5,821 crore in upstream activities, 18.14 percent of its annual outlay for 2018-19. Its overseas arm ONGC Videsh, in turn, spent Rs 1,073 crore of the Rs 5,886 crore it was allocated for the whole year.

In terms of proportion of total allocation for the year, Bharat Petroleum Corporation spent the most among Indian oil companies, exhausting 28 percent of its annual spending target of Rs 7,400 crore in the first three months of the fiscal year.

On the other hand, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) was relatively thrifty, spending only 14 percent of its annual outlay of Rs 8,425 crore in the quarter gone by.

A rise in demand for petrol, diesel, and cooking gas drove up sales of petroleum products by 5.1 percent year on year in the April-June period to 54.22 million tonnes.

In addition to meeting local demand, India also exports petroleum products after refining imported crude. The reinforcements in infrastructure is aimed at meeting local demand and retaining the country's share in the export market.

With Indian oil companies planning expansions, India's refining capacity is slated to increase from 248 million tonnes to 439 million tonnes per annum by 2030. Investment in production units, storage and distribution pipelines are being planned to meet the demand for refined petroleum products.

The government's decision to expedite a push towards greater use of natural gas has prompted oil companies to pursue liquefied natural gas projects. Investment is expected to remain high in the next quarter given that the process of issuing 86 natural gas distribution licenses is underway.",382,0.7974428236484528

The Cabinet today tweaked pre-1999 oil and gas contracts to provide for proportionate sharing of statutory levies like royalty and cess between the operators of an area, and not put the entire burden on state-owned ONGC.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) also extended the special dispensation of marketing and pricing freedom to natural gas produced from areas in the North Eastern region, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters here.

Besides, income tax benefits have now been extended to all the 28 oil and gas fields awarded before the advent of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) in 1999.

The decisions would unlock investments and boost oil and gas production, he said.

The government, he said, had awarded some discovered oil and gas fields to private firms in the 1990s with a view to attracting investments in the country.

To incentivise such investments, the liability of payment of statutory levies like royalty and cess was put on state-owned firms, who were made licensees of the blocks. ONGC and Oil India Ltd were allowed right to back in or take interest of 30-40 percent in the fields, but were liable to pay 100 percent of the statutory levies.

This, Pradhan said, led to fresh investments getting stalled as the state-owned firms were not keen to incur more liabilities.

To correct this, the CCEA has decided that ""statutory levies including royalty and cess will now be shared in proportion to the participating interest of the contractor in pre-NELP exploration blocks"", he said, adding that this would impact seven such fields.

Also, the levy so paid has been made cost recoverable with prospective effect. It means that like capital and operating expense, the statutory levies can now be first recovered from the sale of hydrocarbons before sharing the profits with the government.

""This will benefit pre-NELP exploration blocks in which fresh investment for additional development and production activities is expected as sharing of royalty and cess, and cost recoverability of same will help in making additional investment commercially viable for licensee company -- ONGC/OIL,"" he said.

These are the same conditions that ONGC had insisted upon in 2010 when Vedanta bought Cairn Energy plc's 70 percent stake in the prolific Barmer basin oil block in Rajasthan. ONGC, which held 30 percent stake in the block, gave approval to the deal only when Vedanta agreed to pay its share of royalty and cess.

Royalty for onland block is presently 20 percent. An equivalent amount of cess is also levied.

Pradhan said based on recommendations in 'Hydrocarbon Vision 2030 for North East', the Government has extended timelines for exploration and appraisal period in 10 operational blocks of region considering geographical, environmental and logistical challenges.

""The exploration period has been increased by two years and appraisal period by one year,"" he said. ""Also, to stimulate natural gas production in the region, the government has allowed marketing, including pricing freedom for natural gas, to be produced from discoveries which are yet to commence production as on July 1, 2018.""

The CCEA also decided to extend tax benefits under Section 42 of Income Tax, 1961 prospectively to operational blocks under pre-NELP discovered fields for the extended period of the contract.

Section 42 of Income Tax allows the companies to claim 100 percent of expenditure incurred under a production sharing contract (PSC) as tax deductible for computing taxable income in the same year.

While signing PSC of pre-NELP discovered fields, 13 contracts out of 28 contracts did not have provision for tax benefit under Section 42 of Income-tax Act. Now, this will bring uniformity and consistency in PSCs and provide incentive to the contractor to make an additional investment during the extended period of PSC, he said.

Pradhan said the CCEA also relaxed the timeline from seven days to 15 days for giving written notice to notify the occurrence of a force majure event in a PSC.

""The approvals given today are expected to help in ensuring the expeditious development of hydrocarbon resources,"" he added.",677,0.6570988808359418

When ONGC Board had on March 28, 2016, approved investing USD 5.07 billion in bringing to production a cluster of discoveries in Bay of Bengal block KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5, the first gas was targeted for June 2019 and first oil was to flow by March 2020.

But now, first gas is expected by December 2019 and oil by March 2021, according to the revised dates presented to the company's board late last month.

""These are not new dates. They were out a couple of months back and we gave an update of the project to the board at its meeting on June 29,"" ONGC Director (Offshore) Rajesh Kakkar said.

The revised dates were set when ONGC spudded the first of the 34 wells under the project on April 8 this year.

While the ONGC Board had in March 2016 approved a field development plan for Cluster-II discoveries in the block that sits next to Reliance Industries' flagging KG-D6 block in Krishna Godavari basin, new policies like local purchase preference rules, including the one that mandates PSUs to source domestic iron and steel for infrastructure projects were formulated last year.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST), which made sweeping changes in indirect taxation regime, was rolled out in July 2017.

Also, a policy has been formulated to give public enterprises purchase preference if their bid is within 10 per cent of the lowest price, officials said.

ONGC is targeting a peak oil output of 77,305 barrels per day within two years of the start of production. Gas output is slated to peak to 16.56 million standard cubic metres per day by 2022.

This the second time that target deadlines for KG-D5 production have been pushed back. ONGC had in 2014 announced plans to start gas production from 2018 and oil by 2019 but a final investment decision was made contingent upon government approving a remunerative price for the deep-sea block as the prevalent rates were uneconomical.

But, it was not before March 2016 that the government announced a new pricing formula for difficult areas, giving developers of deepsea fields like KG-D5 more than double the domestic rate.

Immediately after that ONGC Board approved the investment plan for Cluster-II group of discoveries in KG-D5.

The 7,294.6 sq km deepsea KG-D5 block has been broadly categorised into Northern Discovery Area (NDA - 3,800.6 sq km) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA - 3,494 sq km).

The NDA has 11 oil and gas discoveries, while SDA has the nation's only ultra-deepsea gas find of UD-1. These finds have been clubbed in three groups - Cluster-1, Cluster-II and Cluster-III.

Gas discovery in Cluster-I is to be tied up with finds in neighbouring G-4 block for production but this is not being taken up because of a dispute with RIL over the migration of gas from ONGC blocks.

For now, Cluster-II is being developed at a cost of USD 5.07 billion, officials said, adding that completion of the entire development plans is expected by August 2021.

Cluster-2A mainly comprises oil finds of A2, P1, M3, M1 and G-2-2 in NDA which can produce 77,305 bpd (3.86 million tonnes per annum) and 3.81 mmscmd of gas. Cluster 2B, which is made up of four gas finds - R1, U3, U1, and A1 in NDA - envisages a peak output of 12.75 mmscmd of gas. Peak output is likely to last 7 years.

Cluster-3 is the UD-1 gas discovery in SDA. UD-1 lies in the water depth of 2,400-3,200 metres and its development would be taken up after an appropriate technology is found.",638,-0.9781394600868225

India's crude oil production dropped 3 percent to just over 3 million tonnes in May on the back of dip in output from fields operated by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC).

ONGC produced 1.84 million tonnes of crude oil in May as compared to 1.93 million tonnes in the same period last year, an official statement said here.

The firm's output in April-May dipped 4.3 percent to 3.62 million tonnes. This resulted to a drop in the country's oil production to 5.9 million tonnes from 6.03 million tonnes in April-May of 2017.

Natural gas output dropped 1.4 percent to 2,768 billion cubic meters in May as private sector firms like Reliance Industries produced less.

Oil refineries, however, produced 6.8 per cent more fuel at 22.24 million tonnes in May with private sector units of Reliance and Nayara Energy operating at over 100 percent capacity, the statement added.

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan today vowed to not allow petrol and diesel prices go out of reach of the common man, saying the government is working on a holistic solution to price volatility without going back on reforms.

Blaming geopolitics of oil, exchange rate fluctuations and local taxes for petrol and diesel prices touching a record high, he said the government is sensitive and will ensure that ""poor, middle class are not pained.""

""We will deal with the issue,"" he said at a news conference called to highlight his government's achievement in four years. ""The government will take a holistic view (of the situation) so that petrol prices do not pinch them. Government will do all that is possible.""

Asked if the solutions under consideration include partial roll-back of fuel price deregulation, he said, ""Not at all.""

""This question doesn't arise. This government is a pro-reform government and we cannot go back on what we have reformed,"" he said.

The government had deregulated or freed petrol pricing from its control in June 2010 and diesel in October 2014. It allowed revision of prices on daily basis since mid-June last year to reflect changes in cost instantly.

""We will not allow prices to go out of reach of the common man,"" he said.

Pradhan refused to say if the solution being considered includes asking oil producers like ONGC cough-up some money so that fuel can be subsidised, like it used to do till 2015. ""I cannot discuss the solutions being considered,"" he said.

After hitting an all-time high of Rs 78.43 a litre for petrol and Rs 69.31 for diesel on May 29, rates have been cut on subsequent days on softening international oil prices and rupee strengthening against the US dollar.

Petrol price has dropped by 71 paise a litre and diesel by 51 paise. This compares to Rs 3.8 a litre hike in petrol and Rs 3.38 a litre hike in diesel rates in Delhi in the fortnight beginning May 14 when state-owned oil firms ended a 19-day pre-Karnataka poll hiatus to resume daily price revision.

Petrol in Delhi today costs Rs 77.96 and diesel Rs 68.72. Prices in Delhi are the lowest among all metro cities and most state capitals due to lower sales tax or VAT.

Retail prices are still higher than the peak touched during the previous UPA regime. Petrol had touched Rs 76.06 on September 14, 2013. The peak price for diesel during previous UPA government was hit on May 13, 2014, when rates touched Rs 56.71 a litre.

Since January 1, 2018, petrol prices have risen by Rs 7.75 a litre and diesel by Rs 9.16. Petrol price in Delhi was Rs 71.41 a litre and diesel was priced at Rs 56.71 when the present BJP government took office.

Pradhan parried questions on centre cutting excise tax to offer relief to common man.

He said taxes on petrol and diesel are made up of excise duty charged by the centre, and sales tax (VAT) charged by state governments.

The taxes charged by states should be ""reasonable and responsible,"" he said refusing to be drawn into debate on most BJP states refusing to cut VAT.

Left-ruled Kerala had last week taken a lead in cutting VAT on petrol and diesel by Re 1 per litre.

The minister said states have different economic needs and one solution cannot fit all.

The BJP-led government at the centre had raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 11.77 a litre and that on diesel by Rs 13.47 a litre in nine instalments between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell, but then cut the tax just once in October last year by Rs 2 a litre.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) logged a Rs 4,000 crore loss on natural gas output in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 as the government mandated price for the fuel was less than the cost of production.

""We need at least USD 4 per million British thermal unit to break-even as compared to current gas price of USD 3.06 per mmBtu,"" a senior company official said.

As per a new mechanism approved by the government in October 2014, the price of domestically produced natural gas is to be revised every six months -- April 1 and October 1 -- using weighted average of rates prevalent in gas surplus markets like Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (UK excluding Russia), Alberta (Canada) and Russia.

Using this formula, the price for April to September came to USD 3.06 per mmBtu as compared to USD 2.89 in previous six months.

""Our average cost of production is about USD 5.14 per mmBtu. It comes to about USD 3.59 per mmBtu without taking into account return on capital,” the official said. ""Gas production is now a loss-making business as irrespective of cost of production we have to continue paying royalty and other taxes.""

Prices have been less than USD 4 since October 2015. ""Natural gas is no more a profitable business because cost of production is very significantly higher than current gas prices,"" the official said. ONGC, he said, has sought a review of the natural gas pricing formula.

India's largest natural gas producer is demanding a floor or minimum price of natural gas be fixed at USD 4.2 per mmBtu for the business to make economic sense.

The official said ONGC's significant discoveries in KG basin and Gulf of Kutch would need higher price to bring them to production.

Gas discoveries in the shallow sea off Andhra Pradesh on the east, and off Gujarat on the west are economically unviable to produce at the current government-mandated price of USD 3.06, he said, adding that in the absence of a viable gas price, it will have to mothball the USD 1.5-billion projects.

The official said the Krishna Godavari basin block KG- OWN-2004/1 is in shallow water and does not qualify as a 'difficult field', which get higher gas price of USD 6.78 per mmBtu. On the western side, the block GK-28 in Gulf of Kutch is a nomination block which does not qualify for higher rates, he said.

While the KG block will produce a peak output of 5.35 million standard cubic metres per day, the same from Gulf of Kutch block will be around 3 mmscmd. It would take a minimum three years to bring the gas finds to production.

The combined output is about 14 percent of the ONGC's current output of 60 mmscmd. He said the KG block discoveries are in water depth of just about 8-metres, developing which is costly since ultra- shallow rigs are scarce and therefore expensive.

ONGC also has a couple of smaller fields with a total expected peak production of 1.1 mmscmd, which cannot viably produce at the current domestic gas prices.

Natural gas constitutes around 45 percent of ONCG's total crude oil and natural gas production volume. It produces around 75 percent of the country's natural gas output.",555,-0.9999686479568481

ONGC share price fell as much as 3.7 percent intraday Friday after a media report indicated the company may bear the oil subsidy burden and cash-strapped Venezuela has stopped payments of oil dues to ONGC Videsh.

The government may ask state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to bear fuel subsidy to help cut petrol and diesel prices, sources said.

The government does not want to cut excise duty and is looking at alternative means to reduce petrol and diesel prices that had on Tuesday touched an all-time high of Rs 78.43 per litre and Rs 69.31 a litre respectively.

Sources said the alternative in works is to ask ONGC give subsidy to fuel retailers so that they can sell petrol and diesel at below market rates.

Oil producers ONGC and Oil India had till June 2015 made good as much as 40 percent of the under-recoveries or subsidy arising out of selling fuel at below market price. The same subsidy sharing in some form is being brought back, they said.

Petrol and diesel prices have in the last two days have been cut by 8 paisa and 6 paisa a litre, and the government is keen to show a visible reduction which can be possible only if retailers are subsidised.

Brent crude oil futures were trading at $77.87 a barrel, up 0.4 percent while US crude futures rose 0.34 percent to $67.27 a barrel.

Meanwhile, cash-strapped Venezuela has stopped payments of oil dues to ONGC Videsh (OVL), leading to a USD 450 million pile-up, its MD & CEO Narendra K Verma said.

OVL, the overseas arm of ONGC, has 40 percent stake in Venezuela's San Cristobal field, which produces around 18,000 barrels of oil per day.

Venezuelan national oil company Petroleos De Venezuela SA (PDVSA), which holds the remaining 60 percent stake, has not paid the dividend to Indian firm since 2009.

Fuel retailer IOC has for the second year in a row beaten ONGC to become India's most profitable state-owned company, raising questions over calls for the explorer to subsidise retailers amid soaring petrol and diesel rates.

Indian Oil Corporation, which has for decades been India's biggest company by turnover, last week posted a record net profit of Rs 21,346 crore in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 (FY 2017-18), up 12 per cent from Rs 19,106 crore in the last fiscal.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) yesterday reported its FY18 numbers - 11.4 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 19,945 crore.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries retained the crown of being India's most profitable company for the third year in a row, posting highest ever net profit of Rs 36,075 crore.

Tata Consultancy Services, India's largest software services exporter, with a net profit of Rs 25,880 crore was the second most profitable company in the country.

ONGC was for long India's most profitable company but lost the crown to private sector Reliance and TCS three years back. In fact, its profit was higher than the combined net profit of the three state-owned fuel retailers - IOC, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) but now it is behind IOC.

For 2017-18, HPCL last week reported its highest ever net profit of Rs 6,357 crore on a turnover of Rs 2.43 lakh crore. BPCL earlier this week reported a net profit of Rs 7,919 crore for the fiscal.

The sustained profitability of the refining and marketing companies has led to some questioning the rationale of asking ONGC to subsidise fuel that IOC, BPCL and HPCL sell.

""Look at their profits. They don't need any subsidy support,"" said a senior ONGC official.

""We are in the capital-intensive business of oil and gas exploration and production which has to be necessarily funded through internal accruals. Unlike refiners, we cannot get loans for risk E&P business,"" he said.

ONGC is investing Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 35,000 crore annually, which cannot be sustained if it is again asked to subsidise fuel, he insisted.

Upstream oil producers, ONGC and Oil India Ltd had until June 2015 provided for up to 40 per cent of the annual fuel subsidy bill.

This they did this by way of providing discounts on crude sold to downstream refining and marketing companies, IOC, BPCL, and HPCL. This discount helped the retailers make good a part of the losses they incurred on selling petrol and diesel below cost.

The idea of upstream producers again subsidising fuel has been mooted after petrol and diesel prices earlier this week hit a record high of Rs 78.43 per litre and Rs 69.31 respectively. Rates have since marginally cooled but the threat still remains.",477,0.5995059430599212

Global brokerages firm such as CLSA, Jefferies and Nomura have maintained their rating on Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) after it declared its Q4 FY18 earnings after market close on Wednesday.

The oil major reported a 37 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in net profit at Rs 5,915.12 crore on the back of higher oil prices. The company realised $66.71 per barrel of crude oil it produced from nominated fields, up from $54.91 a barrel it earned in January-March 2017.

Gas price realisation was up 15.6 percent at $2.89 per million British thermal unit.

Reacting to the Q4 result, CLSA raised its 12-month target price to Rs 240 from Rs 225 earlier, which translates in an upside of nearly 38 percent from Wednesday’s close of Rs 173.95.

Jefferies and Nomura maintain their minimum target price of Rs 200, which translates in an upside of over 14 percent from current levels.

We have collated recommendations from various global brokerage firms after declaration of its Q4 results:

CLSA: Buy| Raise target price to Rs 240 from Rs 225

CLSA maintains a buy rating on ONGC but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 240 from Rs 225 earlier post Q4 results. EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) and net profit was a miss due to higher operating expenses and larger exploration write-offs.

Higher crude price led to a 6 percent hike in EPS. CLSA assumes upstream companies to bear all subsidies above Rs 40,000 crore. Recent reports of a formula with no subsidy till $70 per barrel is positive for the company.

ONGC is attractively priced at current levels as the risk-reward ratio is favourable. The stock is pricing Brent of US$53/bbl.

Jefferies: Buy| Target: Rs 225

Jefferies maintains a buy rating on ONGC post Q4 results with a target of Rs 225. The global investment bank lifted FY18 std. EPS by 11 percent on a YoY basis, but consolidated EPS, which included HPCL, lagged. Valuations remain inexpensive at 10.2x FY18 P/E when Brent averaged $58.

Nomura: Buy| Target: Rs 200

Nomura maintains a buy rating on ONGC post Q4 results with a 12-month target of Rs 200. It was a weak quarter for ONGC. The global investment bank prefers OMCs compared to upstream companies. The near-term market focus/concerns will be on government measures.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has replaced a government nominee director on board of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) with its nominee as it consolidates control over the company it had recently acquired.

ONGC, which had in January completed the acquisition of the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore, has appointed its Director (Finance) Subhash Kumar on the company board, sources said.

He has replaced Sushma Taishete Rath, Joint Secretary in Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.

Till now HPCL had two government nominee directors - Rath and Sandeep Poundrik, Joint Secretary (Refineries) of the oil ministry.

After the appointment of Kumar, there remains only one government nominee director on HPCL.

The sources said ONGC wants the one government nominee director on HPCL board to be the same person as on its board.

ONGC Board has two government directors - Amar Nath, Joint Secretary - Exploration in the Oil Ministry, and Rajiv Bansal, Additional Secretary & Financial Adviser in the ministry.

It wants Bansal to be appointed on HPCL board in place of Poundrik to have a common link between the two boards, they said.

After acquiring government's stake, HPCL is now a subsidiary of ONGC.

Like its other major subsidiaries -- Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) and ONGC Videsh Ltd, ONGC decided to nominate just one director on the board of HPCL, sources said.

HPCL board currently has four functional directors besides the Chairman and Managing Director. It also has two government nominee directors and six independent directors.

Sources said the Articles of Association of HPCL provide for the board to be made up of a maximum of 20 directors, including independent ones.

ONGC could theoretically speaking, nominate more than one director but such nomination would have to be matched by an appointment of an equal number of independent directors.

So, while ONGC can nominate 3 directors, it decided to name only one, they added.

MRPL and OVL both have just the ONGC Chairman and Managing Director on their board. Both MRPL and OVL have Managing Director and functional directors.

Since HPCL by virtue of 51 per cent shareholding of ONGC, continues to be a central public sector enterprise (CPSE), its board members would continue to be appointed by the government.

Sources said the only question that remains is of the status of HPCL Chairman and Managing Director.

While ONGC's present subsidiaries MRPL and OVL are headed by Managing Directors with ONGC Chairman being the company chairman, there is a thought that HPCL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Kumar Surana may be allowed to hold his designation and the Coal India Ltd (CIL) model for governance of subsidiaries is followed.

CIL, the world's largest coal producer, is the holding company whose board is headed by a Chairman and Managing Director.

It has eight subsidiaries like Eastern Coalfields Ltd and Bharat Coking Coal Ltd, all of which have a board headed by Chairman and Managing Director. The CMDs of the subsidiaries report to CIL head.

Sources said if this model is followed, Surana will continue as Chairman and Managing Director of HPCL who would report to ONGC head Shashi Shanker.

Prior to the stake sale, the government made it clear that HPCL would continue to be a central public sector enterprise (CPSE), retaining its separate identity and brand and will be independently run by its board.

The alternate governance model has been thrown up as a large section in ONGC feels that HPCL should be governed on lines of the company's other subsidiaries like ONGC Videsh Ltd, which have an independent board and a Managing Director or CEO as heads. These heads of subsidiaries report to ONGC Chairman and Managing Director.

Sources said following the CIL-model of governance will save Surana, who is senior to Shanker, from a designation downgrade.",648,

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) ended 4.5 percent lower on Thursday as government to consider levy of tax on oil producers to control the prices of petrol and diesel.

Meanwhile, the share slipped more than 11 percent during the day.

The government may levy a windfall tax on oil producers as part of a permanent solution it is working on for moderating the spiralling retail prices of petrol and diesel.

The tax, which may come in form of a cess, will kick in the moment oil prices cross USD 70 per barrel, sources privy to the development said.

Under the scheme, oil producers, who get paid international rates for the oil they produce from domestic fields, would have to part with any revenue they earn from prices crossing USD 70 per barrel mark.

The revenues so collected would be used to pay fuel retailers so that they absorb spikes beyond the threshold levels, they said.

This may be accompanied by a minor tinkering with excise duty rates to give immediate relief to consumers. States too would be asked to cut sales tax or VAT to show a visible impact on retail prices.

Sources said the thinking in the government is to levy cess on all oil producers — both public and private sector — so as not to attract criticism of stifling state-owned explorers.

A similar tax was considered in 2008 when oil prices were on the rise but the idea was dropped after stiff opposition from private sector firms like Cairn India.

Windfall tax is levied in some of the developed countries globally. The UK in 2011 raised the tax rate to be applied to North Sea oil and gas profits when the price is above USD 75 per barrel.

China on April 1, 2006, began levying the special upstream profit tax on domestic oil producers to redistribute and allocate the windfall income enjoyed by the oil companies and subsidise disadvantaged industry and social groups that are most affected by soaring crude oil prices. In 2012, it raised the windfall tax threshold to USD 55 per barrel.

Sources said the windfall tax is one of the options being considered by the government as a permanent solution to dealing with the problem of spike in oil prices.

Yesterday, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had stated that the government will take a long-term view on retail prices of petrol and diesel, which have touched record high, instead of having an ad hoc measure.

The government raised excise duty nine times between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell, but then cut the tax just once in October last year by Rs 2 a litre.

The Centre levies Rs 19.48 as excise duty on a litre of petrol and Rs 15.33 on diesel. State sales tax or VAT varies from state to state. Unlike excise duty, VAT is ad valorem and results in higher revenues for the state when rates move up.

Sources said the windfall tax is one of the options being considered by the government as a permanent solution to dealing with the problem of spike in oil prices.

This follows reluctance on part of the finance ministry to cut excise duty as it has to ensure adequate funds are available to social welfare schemes in the election year. In particular, resources have to be arranged for the National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS) that aims to provide health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh to every eligible household.

Yesterday, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had stated that the government will take a long-term view on the retail prices of petrol and diesel, which have touched record high, instead of having an ad hoc measure.

Petrol and diesel prices were raised for the 11th day in succession today as the state-owned oil firms gradually passed on to the consumer the increased cost of international oil that had accumulated since a 19-day freeze was imposed just before Karnataka elections.

Since the time the hiatus ended on May 14, rates have gone up by Rs 2.84 a litre in case of petrol and Rs 2.60 in diesel. Petrol costs Rs 77.47 a litre in Delhi and diesel Rs 68.53. Sources said a USD 70 per barrel threshold for the windfall tax is sufficient to cover for capital expenditure requirement of ONGC and other oil producers.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), today reported a 29 per cent jump in its net profit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 as it produced more crude oil and natural gas.

Consolidated net profit in 2017-18 fiscal at Rs 981 crore was 29.6 per cent higher than Rs 757 crore in the previous financial year, the company said in a statement.

OVL is an unlisted company and as such is not obligated to release quarterly earning numbers.

The firm, which has 41 projects in 20 countries spanning from Venezuela to New Zealand, produced 11 per cent more crude oil at 9.35 million tonnes in FY18. Natural gas output was also up 10 per cent at 4.81 billion cubic metres.

""The incremental production was mainly from Vankorneft and Sakhalin-1 projects in Russia; Brazil's BC-10 project, CPO-5 block of Colombia and due to the acquisition of 4 per cent stake in the Lower Zakum Concession project in UAE during the year,"" the statement said.

The board of directors of the company proposed a final dividend of Rs 2 per share for the 2017-18 fiscal, up from 1.4 a share paid in the previous year.

OVL said it along with Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petro Resources Ltd in February acquired 10 per cent stake in Lower Zakum Concession, offshore Abu Dhabi -- the first acquisition by an Indian firm in UAE. The 10 per cent stake was split between OVL, IOC and BRPL in 40:30:30 ratio.

The field produces around 419,000 barrels of oil per day and share of Indian companies is around 42,000 bpd. OVL's share is around 16,800 bpd, it said.

During the year, the company also completed an acquisition of 30 per cent interest in an exploration acreage in Namibia.

ONGC Videsh Vankorneft Pte Ltd (OVVL), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of OVL, took 30 per cent stake in Namibia Petroleum Exploration License 0037 on October 3, 2017 for Blocks 2112A, 2012B and 2113B from Tullow Oil of UK.

Tullow with its remaining 35 per cent participating interest shall continue to be the operator of the license. Pancontinental Namibia (Pty) Ltd with 30 per cent interest and Paragon Oil and Gas (Pty) Ltd with 5 per cent are other partners in the license.

Also, an exploration block in Israel was awarded to an Indian consortium comprising of OVL, Bharat Petro Resources Ltd (BPRL), IOC and Oil India Ltd (OIL).

OVL said Russia has granted a 30 years extension to the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) of Sakhalin-1 block from 2021 to 2051. The company holds 20 per cent stake in the field operation by Exxon.

Elsewhere, Government of Mozambique has accorded approval for the development plan for the Golfinho-Atum natural gas field in the Area 1 block located in the Rovuma Offshore Basin of Mozambique.

""The plan outlines the integrated development of the Golfinho-Atum field through an initial two-train onshore liquefaction plant with a total processing capacity of 12.88 million tonnes per annum,"" OVL said.

The Golfinho-Atum Project will also supply initial volumes of approximately 100 million cubic feet of natural gas per day for domestic sales for Mozambique's industrial development and thereafter make close to 13 million tonnes of LNG annually for exports to nations like India.",593,0.9744779864947001

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) had for more than 13 years paid as much as 40 percent of the under-recoveries arising from fuel retailers selling petrol, diesel, cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene at a government-mandated price, which was way below the cost. This subsidy sharing ended in June 2015 with global oil prices plummeting.

But the risk of them being asked to once again bear a part of the subsidy is looming with the recent rise in international oil rates, Moody's said in a report today.

""Because of the government's widening fiscal deficit, ONGC and OIL could be asked to bear part of the Indian government's fuel subsidy for oil, if prices stay above USD 60 per barrel for the fiscal year ending March 2019,"" Moody's Senior Vice President Vikas Halan said.Moody's said the government could intervene to address record high prices of petrol and diesel by reducing the excise duty on these products, especially if oil prices stay high.

These taxes makeup over 20 percent of the retail selling prices and were increased in 2016 when oil prices fell.

ONGC and OIL, it said, have not contributed to fuel subsidies since June 2015, but have in previous years paid for over 40 percent of the country's annual subsidy bill.

""The net impact of the subsidy sharing will be manageable for ONGC and OIL, even if the two companies are required to bear the entire shortfall between budgeted and actual amounts for the fiscal year ending March 2019,"" Halan said.

The government freed petrol price from its control in June 2010 and diesel in October 2014. It now provides a limited subsidy on LPG and kerosene. Even on LPG, the government from August 2017 stated to raise per cylinder selling price in steps, allowing for a maximum price increase of Rs 4 per bottle per month to gradually eliminate the subsidies. As a result, the LPG selling price increased to Rs 491 per cylinder in April 2018 from Rs 445 a cylinder in June 2017.

Moody's said if ONGC and OIL are obligated to contribute the entire subsidised amount exceeding the government's budgeted figure for 2018-19 fiscal, such a requirement would constrain their net realised prices to USD 52-56 per barrel, which is only marginally lower than or equal to the USD 56 for fiscal 2018.

It estimated that fuel subsidies could total Rs 34,000 crore to Rs 53,000 crore in current fiscal, the highest since fiscal 2015, assuming Brent crude oil prices average USD 60-80 per barrel.

The government has budgeted for Rs 25,000 crore of fuel subsidies in 2018-19, leaving a shortfall of Rs 9,000-28,000 crore, which could be met by ONGC and OIL entirely, or in part, if the government increases the budget allocation for these subsidies.

As for the oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), Moody's says that these companies have been asked to share less than 1 percent of total fuel subsidies since fiscal 2012, and it is unlikely that the proportion of such costs will rise.

On the issue of price deregulation, Moody's says the government is unlikely to reverse fuel pricing deregulation because it remains committed to reforms.

It noted that most petroleum products are sold at market-linked prices in India, except liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene.",594,-0.5746341645717621

Defying a global trend, India's flagship national oil company ONGC did not cut its capital spending on exploration and development after oil prices collapsed between 2014-16, Moody's Investors Service said today.

In a report, Moody's said while ONGC did not reduce capital spending on oil and gas exploration and production, it halted the pace of its international expansion as a response to the oil price slumping from USD 140 per barrel to under USD 40.

""National oil companies (NOCs) worldwide strived to cut costs, adjust growth strategies or sell assets since the 2014-16 collapse in oil prices, just as oil companies without state sponsors have done,"" the rating agency said in a report.

The decline in oil prices did not significantly affect Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which saw its consolidated EBITDA for 2015-16 decline by only 16 percent compared to the same period three years earlier.

Moody's said this because ONGC's share of India's fuel subsidy burden offset that decline.

""ONGC was more exposed to the decline in natural gas prices, which nearly halved in India during that period as gas prices fell internationally,"" it said.

Despite the oil price decline, ONGC did not reduce its capital spending on exploration and development, Moody's said. ""However, the company halted the pace of its international expansion from early 2014 to mid-2016, when it resumed overseas acquisitions, including its completion of a 26 percent stake in CSJC Vankorneft, the owner of (Russia's) Vankor Field and North Vankor license, for USD 1.9 billion (after adjusting for cash profits),"" it said.

All of ONGC's overseas acquisition activity has been in line with the Government of India's strategic objective of ensuring energy security for the country, which relies on imports for nearly 80 percent of its oil consumption.

Moody's estimated a capex of USD 7-7.5 billion for ONGC in the year to March 2019. This compares to USD 5.6 billion spending in 2014-15 and USD 12.3 billion in 2017-18. ONGC's spending in 2017-18 was higher because of one-off acquisition of the government's stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL).

To help improve the vertical integration profile of its business, ONGC in January acquired 51.1 percent of HPCL, India's third-largest refining and marketing company, from the government for Rs 36,915 crore. The government sold the stake to help reduce its fiscal deficit.

In the report that examined how changes in policy and structure since the oil price collapse will affect some of the largest NOCs worldwide, Moody's said NOCs globally have adjusted to a more moderate band of oil prices since the transforming price collapse of late 2014 to early 2016.

""Every NOC's own circumstances depend on a host of factors, such as the strength of support from its government sponsor, and the company's ability to control local markets,"" it said.",509,-0.4981124997138977

State-owned ONGC registered 6.3 percent increase in natural gas production in 2017-18 and is on track to double the output by 2022, a top company official said. It produced 23.484 billion cubic meters of gas in 2017-18 as against 22.088 bcm in 2016-17, he said.

This is the highest gas output by Oil and Natural Gas Corp in five years and the growth rate is higher than the global average of 3-4 percent year-on-year.

ONGC has stepped up on bringing newer fields into production after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a stiff target of reducing oil import dependence by 10 percent by 2022. India currently imports over 80 percent of its oil needs.

The overall gas production, which includes production from the joint ventures, registered a growth of 5.8 percent at 24.610 bcm, as against 23.270 bcm in the previous year.

""This is the highest ever overall growth in percentage terms since 2001-02,"" he said. The company is targeting gas production of 24.41 bcm during the current financial year and incur an investment of around Rs 7,000 crore.

While the main incremental growth stand-alone basis came from western offshore, the onshore fields have also contributed substantially despite natural decline coupled with several other constraints.

During the last financial year, ONGC's offshore gas production stood at 17.845 bcm against 16.883 bcm produced in 2016-17. The onshore registered a production of 5639 bcm gas in the last fiscal year against the production of 5.205 in the previous fiscal.

The growth in output was largely contributed by C-26 Cluster fields, Daman and Vasai East fields in the western offshore as well as sub-sea well S2AB in the eastern offshore, he said.

From the onshore fields, there has been an increase in production particularly from Ramnad area in Cauvery Asset. There has also been a considerable increase in associated gas production from Ankleshwar and Assam Assets.

When reached for comments, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker said the company has been aggressively pursuing the gas production growth in line with the government's drive for cleaner gas economy.

He said the company has charted out a mission to double the gas production at 42.7 bcm by 2021-22.

""The production growth last year is only a testimony to that goal,"" he said, adding the company was on track to meet the target.

The total investment in the ONGC's ambitious gas projects stands at Rs 57,000 crores, which is one of the highest investments in the world as far as the gas projects are concerned. This investment includes the high potential KG-DWN-98/2 project which is being implemented on a fast track basis. First gas from the project is targeted for 2019.

The job for the early monetisation of discoveries both from the west and the east coast has been rigorously monitored at the highest level in order to ensure that the company's ambitious gas production goal is achieved on schedule, Shanker said.

The official said ONGC has drastically reduced gas flaring during the last fiscal, leading to considerable savings. The gas flaring stood at 1.92 percent in 2017-18, lowest since 1999-2000. This is only technical flaring and due to non-availability of customers like in the previous years.",541,0.830109009375939

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will hire international oil service companies for the first time to raise output from mature oilfields.

India's top oil and gas producer has shortlisted Schlumberger, Halliburton and GE subsidiary Baker Hughes for raising output from Kalol field in Gujarat and Geleki field in Assam, according to tender document floated by the company.

Other oilfield service providers meeting pre-qualification criteria can also bid for the job by May 25, it said.

The service providers will be paid a fee for raising output beyond an agreed baseline production.

""To achieve the objective of production enhancement of oil and gas from mature fields, ONGC invites global oil and gas service providers having firm commitment to invest and processing capabilities to bid,"" the document said.

""The service provider will be required to invest in capital expenditure and operating expenditure to increase production from the existing 'baseline' production.""

ONGC is looking to raise domestic output quickly to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of cutting import dependence by 10 per cent by 2022. India currently imports over 80 per cent of its oil needs.

Originally, ONGC had on December 7, 2016 signed a Summary of Understanding (SoU) to give Kalol field to Halliburton and Geleki field to Schlumberger for raising production above the current baseline output. Though the contracts were signed in presence of Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, ONGC rescinded them last year on fears of courting controversy for handing fields on nomination basis.

Thereafter, the company in June 2017 floated an expression of interest (EoI) from service providers for undertaking production enhancement.

""Following are the names of vendors meeting the pre-qualification criteria (of EoI) : Schlumberger Asia Services, Halliburton Offshore Services Inc and Baker Hughes Singapore PTE Ltd,"" the firm said in the document seeking final bids by May 25.

The 15-year Production Enhancement Contract (PEC) will require the oilfield service producer to commit to investing in capital expenditure and operating expenditure to increase production from the existing 'baseline' output.

A tariff will be paid in USD per barrel of oil and USD per million British thermal unit for gas for any incremental hydrocarbon produced and saved over the baseline.

The baseline shall be prepared by ONGC and vetted and certified by a third party of international repute.

All the oil and gas produced will belong to ONGC and the service provider arrangement is being entered into to get the best technology available, sources said.

Besides Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes, ONGC was also in talks with Weatherford International.

Sources said based on the experience of Kalol and Geleki, the PEC model may be extended to other onshore fields.",452,

India’s top energy company may have compromised the lives and safety of its employees and its actions may have resulted in the exchequer incurring losses, an investigative report by CNN-News18 has found.

Documents accessed by the television news channel revealed that Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India (ONGC) has been flouting its own norms by refurbishing its old cranes, instead of replacing them.

According to the 'Maharatna' company’s norms, the lifespan of a crane is 20 years, after which they have to be replaced. They should also be replaced if the price of refurbishment exceeds 75 percent of the cost price of a new crane.

However, ONGC has decided to refurbish as many as 21 cranes, 18 of which are over 20 years old, despite the cost of repairing each one coming close to that of a new crane.

The role of these cranes on offshore oil platforms cannot be over-emphasised. Because space becomes a vital constraint on these platforms, cranes are used to move containers between the work site and the storage area. Whether it is to bring in food, water or equipment, cranes play a vital role.

It all started on March 24, 2017, when ONGC invited tender for 27 cranes. Once the tender was invited, an anonymous written complaint was made by one Mujib Naithani, which said three deck cranes that were a part of the tender process were already recommended for replacement by the ONGC Executive Purchase Committee on October 17, 2008.

Paying heed to the complaint, ONGC decided to cut its requirement and invite tender for only 24 cranes, for which it issued a fresh tender November 9, 2017. Naithani, however, filed another complaint at this point, saying three more deck cranes that were a part of the tender process were already recommended for replacement by the ONGC Executive Purchase Committee on October 17, 2008. This led to the final tally of cranes being brought down to 21.

According to ONGC's 'Equipment Replacement Policy for Offshore Equipments', cranes must be replaced after 20 years, but they can also be replaced if the cost of repairs on any single occasion exceeds 75 percent of the replacement cost.

In a meeting in 2007, it was it was found out that out of the 45 cranes ONGC had, 28 cranes were already over 20 years old and 9 others were over 18. However, considering the lead time for availability of new cranes would be over three years, it was contemplated that the option of replacing the cranes may not be feasible, since revamping them would take lesser time and would add to their life by approximately 15 years.

On March 7 this year, the company invited tender for the refurbishment of 21 cranes, 18 of which are over 20 years old now. Of the 18, 11 are actually over 25 years old. (SEE GFX1)

According to the documents available with CNN-News18, an Indian company called G&T Oilfield and Offshore Services had submitted a proposal to replace the cranes at a price of USD 870,000 apiece. The cost of repair for at least 10 of the cranes that are being refurbished exceeds 75 percent of the quoted amount. In some cases, it is almost as much as the price of a new crane.

The price quoted by the Sparrow group for refurbishment was between Rs 4.00 crore and Rs 5.60 crore apiece, depending on the capacity of the crane. (SEE GFX2)

The contract to repair these 21 cranes was given to a company called Sparrows Offshore Group, which is a part of a service contractor group called Energy Cranes International (along with Aberdeen Hydraulics and Baricon Systems). ONGC had kept Energy Cranes out of its approved vendor list.

This raises several questions about the conduct of ONGC: Why has the company decided to break all its norms to award a contract for refurbishment? Is there a hint of a scam here? Why has ONGC kept mum on the detailed questionnaire sent by CNN-News18 for over two weeks?",671,-0.8866405288378397

Norway’s Statoil ASA is planning to enter India’s upstream hydrocarbon space in partnership with state-run ONGC for deep-water exploration, according to a report in Mint.

India's exploration and production (E&P) of deep water blocks policies are in line with Statoil's move to come to the country, a top Indian government official aware of the development told the paper.

The Norwegian state-run firm is also interested at investing in offshore wind projects in India. The firms had called on or expression of interest (EoI) with the Indian government last week for the first such project in the Gujarat coast.

“We have had very good discussions with the Norwegian government representatives and Statoil as well. We can do a long-term technology partnership with them. There can be many things. In the coming days, E&P in India will happen in deep waters. So, if we get Norway and Statoil as a partner, there can’t be nothing better than that,” the senior official told the paper on condition of anonymity.

Earlier, Statoil had an Indian presence through Norway’s Norsk Hydro until its oil and gas operations merged with Statoil in 2007. Alongwith Norsk Hydro's 15 percent stake, Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) owned a 10 percentin ONGC’s KG-DWN-98/2 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin off the coast of Andhra Pradesh. Both the firms quit their partnership with India in 2010 over delays in approving their participation in the development of India’s key gas find.

Ingvil Smines Tybring-Gjedde, Norway’s deputy minister of petroleum and energy, declined to comment on the proposed partnership between Statoil and ONGC.

""We are positive towards the development that we have seen of late in the licensing conditions in India. That we find interesting,” Tor Martin Anfinnsen, senior vice-president (marketing and supply) at Statoil, told the paper.

“As we speak, there is no agreement or deal between Statoil and ONGC. But it’s natural for Statoil to particularly access deep-water where we have acknowledged expertise worldwide,” Tor Martin Anfinnsen added.",338,0.9999998807907104

Iran has agreed to take the gas produced from the ONGC Videsh Ltd-discovered Farzad-B field in the Persian Gulf, but differences remain over returns on investments made by the Indian firm.

Iran previously conditioned granting rights to develop the Farzad-B fields to OVL on Indian firms buying all of the gas produced at the imported-LNG equivalent rate.

This proposition, which involved an investment of USD 11 billion in first developing the field and then setting up a facility to convert it into liquid gas (liquefied natural gas or LNG) for shipping to India, was considered very expensive, sources privy to the development said.

Iran has now written to OVL, agreeing to take delivery of all of the gas produced from Farzad-B offshore field at a landfall point in the Persian Gulf nation.

OVL, the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), too has written back accepting the offer and has asked Iran to detail the delivery point, they said.

Sources said Iran has stated that it will take all of the unprocessed natural gas and asked OVL to re-do the investment numbers.

OVL, which had in 2008 discovered the Farzad-B gas field, feels it can lower the upstream field development investment to under USD 4 billion from previously proposed USD 6.2 billion.

On top of the USD 6.2 billion investment, another USD 5 billion was to be invested for setting up the LNG plant.

Sources said OVL will now do just the upstream field development plan and no longer set up the LNG plant.

But the rate of return that Iran is offering to the Indian firm continues to be a hindering block.

On the face of it, Iran is offering 15 percent return on the investment made. But after considering the conditions attached, the return comes to 5-6 percent only, sources said.

Sources said the upstream investment would be lower as unlike the previous proposal, OVL would not be setting up any plant to process the gas produced from the field.

Farzad-B gas contains a high degree of sulphur and needs treating before it can be sold to users, they said.

OVL had last year made its 'best' offer to spend USD 11 billion in developing the Farzad-B field in the Persian Gulf as well as in building the infrastructure to export. The company has now agreed to do just the upstream field development part, leaving the marketing of the fuel to Iran.

Farzad-B was discovered by OVL in the Farsi block about 10 years ago. The project has so far cost the OVL-led consortium, which also includes Oil India Ltd and Indian Oil Corp (IOC), over USD 80 million.

The field has an in-place gas reserve of 21.7 trillion cubic feet, of which 12.5 Tcf is believed to be recoverable.

India and Iran were initially targeting concluding a deal on Farzad-B field development by November 2016 but later mutually agreed to push the timeline to February 2017. The deadline to wrap up negotiations was later targeted for September 2017. But, with deal stuck over pricing of gas, no new deadlines have been proposed.",529,-0.9998961687088013

A review committee of the Assam Assembly has accused oil behemoth ONGC of not adhering to various norms in recruitment of 22 posts reserved for people with disabilities (PWDs).

The panel has also asked the government to formulate regulations for 100 per cent reservation of local people in Grade-III and IV posts in PSU firms of the state.

In its report submitted to the House yesterday, the Employment Review Committee of the Assam Assembly observed that the ONGC notification for recruitment to the 22 vacant posts did not follow a prescribed format in accordance with Rule 4 of the Employment Exchanges Act, 1959.

""As per the Supreme Court verdict, it is mandatory to intimate the employment exchange, which then should sponsor the name of the candidates. The ONGC Assam Asset did not give any scope to the Employment Exchange to sponsor the candidates against vacancies,"" it added.

The committee also pointed out that the ONGC claimed to have issued notifications to 10 local employment exchanges, asking them to inform eligible candidates with valid registration numbers about the job vacancies, but when asked, ONGC could not provide the details of the applicants.

The Assembly panel advised the government to formulate overall recruitment policy, in accordance with findings of Gujarat Resolution, to provide jobs to local youths in PSU firms such as ONGC, OIL, Indian Railways and Coal India.

""During the course of discussion, the committee observed that there is no clear cut government policy regarding recruitment of local people, including PwDs, in the Grade-III and IV posts of public sector undertakings in Assam.

""The committee recommends that the department concerned should formulate policy for cent per cent recruitment of local candidates in Grade-III and IV posts in all PSUs of the state,"" the report said.

The investigation by the Assembly panel also found that not a single member representing the government or the Skill, Employment & Entrepreneurship Development Department was part of the selection committee, even as the norms suggest that the notification should have been forwarded to the department first for wider publicity.

""The committee noted that that the ONGC Assam Asset had mentioned in their advertisement that the 22 vacant posts for PwDs are for Assam, but did not specify who can apply for the posts (and) whether it is restricted to the candidates of Assam only…"" the report said.

It asked the oil major to clearly mention that the Grade-III and IV PWD posts are reserved for the candidates of Assam while publishing the advertisements in future.

The review committee recommended that the existing 14 vacant posts for PwDs should be filled up through local employment echanges and sought the creation of 30 new Grade-III and IV PWD posts for the local people of Assam.

""The committee recommends that the Recruitment Board/Selection Committee of all PSUs and all public enterprises should consist of at least one member representing the government of Assam/Directorate of Skill, Employment & Entrepreneurship Development, Assam, in the line with Oil India Ltd, Duliajan, Assam,"" the report said.

The panel also said that the ONGC should associate itself with the local ITIs or polytechnic institutes to provide apprenticeship to the students so that can apply for Grade-III and IV posts in future.",547,

The recent price hike of natural gas by the centre may result in an additional revenue of Rs 1500 crore to the state-owned ONGC Limited during the first half of the current fiscal, said global rating and research agency Moody’s.

The price paid to most of natural gas produced from domestic fields will be USD 3.06 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for six months, beginning April 1, from current USD 2.89, according to a recent notification issued by oil ministry’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.

""Natural gas contributed around 45 percent of ONCG’s total crude oil and natural gas production volume in fiscal 2017.""

""Assuming natural gas sales volume of around 10 billion cubic meters for the first six months of fiscal 2019 for ONGC and its joint venture partners, ONGC’s natural gas revenue will increase 23 percent to Rs 80 billion (Rs 8000 crore) for the six months between 1 April and 30 September 2018, from a reported Rs 65 billion (Rs 6500 crore) the year before"", Moody’s said in its credit outlook issued today.

The government revises domestic natural gas prices every six months using a pricing formula based on a volume-weighted annual average of prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (UK excluding Russia), Alberta (Canada) and Russia, it added.

India’s oil and gas producers, including ONGC, are unlikely to increase gas production over the next 12-18 months because most of the discovered resources will take at least another two to three years to reach production, the report opined. ONGC, accounted for 70 percent of the country’s natural gas production on a standalone basis for fiscal 2017.

""We expect India’s LNG imports to increase because domestic production growth will lag the growth in domestic demand for LNG. India’s oil and gas producers, including ONGC, are unlikely to increase gas production over the next 12-18 months because most of the discovered resources will take at least another two to three years to reach production,"" the report said.

India relies on LNG imports to meet its energy needs, with LNG imports accounting for 44.5 percent of total natural gas consumption in India in fiscal 2017, it said.

With government attempt to get a buyer for Pawan Hans reportedly coming a cropper and forcing it to rework the bids, the chopper operator’s union has urged the management to reconsider the privatisation move.

In a letter to the Prime Minister last week, Pawan Hans Helicopters union All-India Civil Aviation Employees Union, has suggested to the government to first increase ONGC's stake from the present 49 percent and then go for a public issue as per the earlier five-year business plan instead of an outright sale, according to sources.

At the same time, the union also met civil aviation minister Suresh Prabhu and submitted a memorandum, opposing the decision to hand over a profit-making entity to private players ""against its own disinvestment guidelines"".

Government had last October invited bids from private companies, including foreign ones, to buy out its entire 51 percent stake along with management control in Pawan Hans, a Miniratna under the administrative control of the civil aviation ministry. The remaining 49 percent stake is held by oil behemoth ONGC.

However, it reportedly failed to attract enough bidders and now the whole process is being revisited.

""We came to know from various newspaper reports that government had received very poor response for Pawan Hans. Considering this, we’d request that the government consider as a second option which was suggested by the employees union in various letters to civil aviation and finance ministries and the PMO,"" the union letter said.

Stating that the Pawan Hans is a profit-making entity since its inception and has been paying dividend each year, the union said ""as per existing disinvestment policy, those units having a positive net worth, no accumulated losses and having earned net profit for three preceding consecutive years be required to achieve the mandatory listing norms of 25 percent public holding for listing on the stock exchange...""

Pawan Hans has been paying dividends to both government and ONGC, it said, adding, ""total dividend it has paid out till date is Rs 2,345 crore from 1995-96 to 2015-2016 while the total taxes paid stand Rs 480 crore during this period.""

""The management control of Pawan Hans can be given to ONGC by allowing it increase its stake and subsequently go in for a public issue to get government a much higher price from the sale of shares in stretches in the next five years with expansion and improved performance,"" the letter said.

As government has considered and allowed similar units to participate in the process of strategic sale, it should allow Airport Authority, ONGC and HAL to participate in this process, it added.

""It is humbly submitted that it may not be the right time for strategic sale in the company as it is on growth path as well,"" the union said.",482,0.04040344059467316

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) may buy out gas utility GAIL India Ltd in its Dahej mega petrochemical project in Gujarat to take full control of the recently commissioned plant.

GAIL had in 2008 picked up 19 percent stake in ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPaL), which was then building the mega petrochemical complex at Dahej in Gujarat.

But the project, which started in 2006, faced major cost and time overruns, which forced GAIL to restrict its equity contribution to the original Rs 996.28 crore. This investment in the expanded project cost meant that the gas utility's stake dropped first to 17 percent, then to 15.5 percent and now about 9 percent, sources privy to the development said.

""It doesn't make any business sense to hold such a small percentage stake and it is best that ONGC buys out GAIL in the project,"" they said.

The 1.1 million tonnes plant, which at the time of conception was projected to cost Rs 12,440 crore, got completed only last year for about Rs 30,000 crore.

After GAIL in 2008 agreed to pick up 19 percent stake in OPaL, the project cost was in 2010 was revised to Rs 19,535 crore. It was couple of years later further revised upwards to Rs 21,396 crore with December 2013 set as the commissioning date.

Sources said when project cost was revised to Rs 19,535 crore, GAIL decided to restrict its participation to 17 percent. This was done because the company's board had powers to approve an investment of only up to Rs 1,000 crore.

Consequently, it decided to make an equity contribution of Rs 996.28 crore towards the 17 percent stake, they said.

But when the project cost went up further to Rs 21,396 crore, the promoter's equity contribution increased from Rs 5,860.5 crore to Rs 6,418.8 crore at 70:30 debt-equity ratio.

GAIL, sources said, is not inclined to make any additional equity contribution and has decided to cap its investment in OPaL at the capital it has already approved — Rs 996.28 crore. This, in the revised project cost, fetched it only 15.5 percent stake.

Now that the project cost almost touched Rs 30,000 crore, that investment is equivalent to only about 9 percent stake.

Sources said GAIL would, however, continue to hold rights to market 38 percent of the polymer and other chemicals produced by OPaL even at the reduced equity stake.

ONGC has funded almost all of the enhanced project cost after GAIL as well as Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC), which was to originally hold 5 percent stake, did not make more equity contributions.

ONGC had attributed the increase in project cost primarily to additional cost of Phase-II captive power plant and increase in cost of building the Phase-I electricity generating unit.",471,-0.12544658780097961

The Nifty, previous Friday ended 1.59 percent down at 10,195.15. Negative opening and follow-through sell off led the Benchmark index below 10,290 mark.

Violent selloff got intensified in the latter half of the session and the Nifty continued making lower lows towards ending the day with a huge bearish candle. In our previous communication, we disused about the possibility of trend reversal and we witnessed a brutal sell off since the beginning of the session towards ending the week on an extreme bearish note.

Needless to say, we expect this bearish momentum to get carried into the coming week as well and the Nifty to challenge recent rebounding zone placed around 10,140. Midway support is placed around 10180. Nifty 200 daily EMA placed around 10,110 might be the next destination.

On the Nifty hourly chart; -DI +DI bearish cross over while MACD declined below the zero line suggests, this bearish trend is likely to sustain. Further, sharply falling RSI is also another argument. Hence, sell on rise is the strategy to be followed. Upside pivotal resistance is placed around 10,290.

Nifty patterns on multiple time frames show, Nifty may continue to trade on the weaker side as long as it trades below 10,290. Downside supports are placed around 10,180, 10,140 and 10,110.

The Bank Nifty previous Friday ended 1.22 percent down at 24,489.55. It closed at the 200 daily EMA placed around 24,490. Leading indicators suggests, it may continue to trade on the weaker side as long as it trades below 24,850 and may well again challenge critical support of 24,000.

Based on thorough technical study, the research firm has recommended ONGC which can give up to 5% return in the near short term:

ONGC | Rating: Sell | Target: Rs 170, Stop loss: Rs 185 | Return: 5%

The stock finished off the week with a bearish candle below the 200 daily EMA placed around Rs 182 levels. This bearish momentum is backed by rising volume. Also, rising negative open interest in previous three sessions makes the bear case even stronger.

Hence, based on the above mentioned observations, we recommend ONGC Ltd as a strong sell on rise for the near-term downside target of Rs 170.

The income tax department has asked 10 PSUs to pay their shortfall in taxes over the years, according to a Business Standard report.

The list includes State Bank of India (SBI) and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), the report said.

Some of the tax claims might be disputed, according to the report.

To get a stay, the company will have to settle one-fifth of the total tax amount sought. The companies can then appeal at an appellate court or high court.

""If the judgment goes in favour of the payer, the amount paid will be adjusted or refunded by the department,"" A partner at a consultancy told the paper.

The move is a precautionary measure to ensure that the target for tax collection is met, sources told Business Standard.

If the I-T department is unable to meet the expected target, then public sector undertakings (PSUs) will be asked to pay for past tax demands.

Inconsistency in the advance tax payments caused the I-T Department to take this decision, sources said.

The deadline for companies to pay advance tax is on Thursday. Advance tax is paid in four installments throughout the year.

About 3.18 lakh crore was collected as advance tax from April 2017 to December 2017, according to official data.",221,-0.9911399483680725

The company lost five key operational personnel when a Pawan Hans helicopter crashed in the Arabian Sea in January.

""Lot of companies world over have a policy of not allowing more than two senior executives flying together. We are also thinking of putting the same policy in operation for our offshore operations,"" a senior ONGC executive said.

When on January 13 a Dauphin N3 helicopter, operated by Pawan Hans, crashed off the Mumbai coast, ONGC lost topline operational in-charges of its key Mumbai High oil and gas fields. Two pilots ferrying them to an offshore oil and gas facility were also killed in the accident, the cause of which is still being investigated.

""We lost installation/location managers and maintenance in-charges of Mumbai High North, NQ and Water Injection North (WIN) platforms in the accident,"" he said adding a sixth key operational executive had dropped out of the ill-fated flight at the last moment due to ill health.

Any oil and gas field of ONGC is headed by the asset manager and installation or location managers are just below him.

The official said a decision on barring key executives from flying together is likely to be taken soon.

ONGC, he said, has engaged an expert team from the Rotary Wing Society of India (RWSI) to carry out a thorough audit of all helicopter operations of the company and submit a report on maintenance practices, operational procedures and safety issues.

RWSI is a not-for-profit professional body specialising in both civil and military helicopters. It is an affiliate of Helicopter Association International (HAI) and headed by Air Vice Marshall K Sridharan.

""While the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing the reasons for the accident, we wanted to ascertain if the talks of poor maintenance at Pawan Hans could be a factor,"" the official said.

The RWSI report is expected later this month.

Improper maintenance, non-adherence to procedures, non-compliance of safety regulations by the operator are some of the common findings in probe reports prepared by the DGCA into 20 of 25 accidents involving Pawan Hans helicopters over the last 30 years. Since 1988, 91 people have been killed in these accidents, including 60 passengers, 27 pilots and four crew.

The Dauphin is a medium weight multi-purpose twin-engine helicopter.

""We don't know the reasons for the accident yet. Only after competent authorities examine the black block (flight and cockpit voice recorder) can we know the reasons. We haven't been told anything about the reasons by the aviation authorities so far,"" the official said.

Both engines of the helicopter were found to be intact, ruling out the possibility of a mid-air explosion.

Pawan Hans operates seven Dauphin N3 Helicopters for ONGC's offshore operations. These helicopters, based at Juhu airport, Mumbai and Rajahmundry, undertake passenger crew change service and production trips on a regular basis to meet the offshore requirements of the state-owned oil and gas producer.

Pawan Hans is a joint venture between the government of India owning 51 per cent stake, and ONGC which holds the remaining 49 per cent interest.

As of January 2017, Pawan Hans has a fleet of 46 helicopters. It was incorporated to provide helicopter support services to the oil sector, services in remote and hilly areas, as well as, for charter services.

In 2015, a Pawan Hans chopper had crashed off Mumbai High, the country's largest offshore oilfield 176 kilometres off the Mumbai coast. The helicopter, which was conducting night landing practice, was carrying two pilots. Only one body was found.",615,-0.9007263660430909

Proxy advisory firm IiAS has questioned state-owned ONGC seeking exemption from taking shareholders' nod for acquisition of the government's stake in HPCL, saying such leniency with regard to public votes is not warranted.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) bought the government's 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,916 crore.

The acquisition price of Rs 473.97 per share was finalised on January 20 and the deal was completed as an off-market transaction on January 31 and ONGC is now asking shareholders to ratify it, IiAS said.

The purchase qualifies as a related party transaction (RPT) as the government holds majority stake in ONGC and was selling its stake in HPCL.

IiAS said Section 188 of the Companies Act states that 'prior approval' is required for firms to enter into RPTs. In cases where such an approval was not taken, the Act allows for ratification till a period of three months.

""This is understandable for routine transactions which are in the ordinary course of business. But given the legal and operational complexities in rolling back stake purchases, as a good governance measure, ONGC should have refrained from going ahead with the transaction before the shareholder vote,"" it said in a note.

On the company's assertion in the shareholder notice that seeking prior approval for a price sensitive deal was impracticable, it said, ""This is unfathomable, given that the purchase has been under consideration for several months and there was no real urgency to close the deal.""

""Questions to be asked: Why could ONGC not wait for shareholder approval before purchasing the stake? What happens if the resolution is defeated? Does the company have a plan in place to roll back the transaction in case the resolution is defeated?,"" it asked.

Both the Companies Act and SEBI (LODR) Regulations 2015 exempt public-sector undertakings from seeking shareholder approval where the RPTs are conducted with another PSU. But there are no such exemptions for transactions between the government and a PSU.

""Despite this, SEBI, vide its letter dated November 30, 2017, has already granted exemption to ONGC from having to take shareholder approval. ONGC has also applied to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs for an exemption – once granted the current resolution (seeking shareholder nod) will be withdrawn. IiAS believes this renders otiose the entire exercise,"" the note said.

IiAS said discerning shareholders who have taken the time and effort to analyse and vote will be left in the lurch if the resolution were to be withdrawn.

It went on to ask if ONGC should be given preferential treatment, and avoid the shareholder voting process.

Stating that PSU shareholders have expectations regarding governance standards, it said the current legal framework fails to provide a level playing field.

""The Government is often able to push its agenda forward, which might not always be in the best interests of the company's direct and immediate stakeholders,"" it said.

The advisory firm said there is a need for greater introspection across the board. ""In the listed space, there cannot be different standards for PSUs and private companies. It is time for the Government and regulators to bridge this governance gap,"" it said.

While listing of PSUs is cited as the biggest driver of accountability and transparency, there is a big divergence in standards applicable for state-owned and private companies.

""In ONGC’s case, the company is seeking regulatory exemptions. While IiAS supports the overall transaction, it believes that such leniency with regard to public votes are not warranted,"" the note said.",631,-0.9905397693316141

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has sought shareholder approval for its decision to buy government's 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,915 crore.

With government also being a majority shareholder in ONGC, the acquisition fell in the definition of related party transaction for which shareholder nod is needed as per law, the company said in a shareholder notice seeking approval for the deal through a postal ballot.

""However, as a related party to the transaction, there will be no participation by the government of India in the postal ballot process,"" it said. ONGC said it bought the entire shareholding of the government of India in HPCL at Rs 473.97 per share.

The transaction was consummated as an offmarket transaction on January 31, after which ONGC had become the holding company of HPCL, it said.

ONGC said it was seeking shareholder ""ratification through postal ballot for acquisition of 77.88 crore equity shares, representing 51.11 per cent, in the paid-up capital of HPCL from Government of India (GoI)"" since the GoI, being the promoter, is a related party.

A March 30, 2017, government notification specifies the limits for transactions beyond which related party transaction shall require approval of the shareholders.

With regard to the category of 'sale, purchase or supply of any goods or materials', limit has been prescribed as 10 per cent or more of turnover or Rs 100 crore, whichever is lower.

""The transaction between GoI and your company for sale and purchase of 51.11 per cent shareholding of the GoI in HPCL at its market capitalisation exceeded the threshold limit,"" ONGC said in the notice to shareholders reasoning the approval. ONGC said the Companies Act of 2013 provides for ratification by shareholders within three months of any agreement entered without such explicit nod.

""Since the price per share was the critical element of the transaction and it was agreed only on January 20, 2018, and also incorporated in the 'share purchase agreement' entered into between the GoI and the company on that date, the prior approval was impracticable,"" it said. ""Accordingly, the present proposal seeking the ratification of the transaction by the members is sent.""

While ONGC is predominantly an upstream oil and gas production, HPCL is a oil refining and fuel marketing company. With acquisition of HPCL, ONGC would have presence across the entire value chain in the oil and gas industry and emerge as an integrated oil and gas company, the company said in the notice.

""The acquisition will bring synergies between both the companies."" ONGC said SEBI granted specific exemption to this transaction from making the mandatory open offer in such acquisition as the ultimate ownership of HPCL wasn't changing.

""The company has also applied to the ministry of corporate affairs for a clarification/exemption for related party transactions between the Government of India and government companies. Accordingly, in case the exemption/substitution notification is issued by ministry of corporate affairs before the last date for postal ballot process, the resolution shall be withdrawn as not being required in view of such exemption,"" it said.

Late date for postal ballot is March 27. ONGC said its board commends the resolution for the ratification of the members.",546,

Oil producer ONGC has said it may miss the June 2019 target for starting production from its Krishna Godavari basin block due to new policies like GST and local purchase preference rules, including the one that mandates state-owned firms to source domestic iron and steel for infrastructure project.

Clarifying on its last week's filing to stock exchanges, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) said the new policies it had cited for a possible delay pertained to local purchase preference policy, steel policy and GST policy.

""The new policies concerning oil and mining sector, as referred in the reply of ONGC to NSE and BSE, though not amply clarified in the reply, were pertaining to policies like purchase preference policy, steel policy, GST policy etc. and not regulatory policy,"" ONGC said in a statement.

While the ONGC Board had in March 2016 approved a USD 5.07 billion investment for bringing oil and gas discovered in the KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block in Bay of Bengal to production, new policies were formulated last year.

The Union Cabinet in May 2017 approved a policy that will prefer sourcing of domestic iron and steel for infrastructure projects by state-owned companies in a bid to boost Make in India.

Also, a policy has been formulated to give public enterprises purchase preference if their bid is within 10 per cent of the lowest price. Goods and Services Tax (GST) was also rolled out in July 2017.

Last week, ONGC informed stock exchanges that after its Board in March 2016 approved the field development plan (FDP), it began procuring goods and services such as drilling, completion of wells, creation of production and processing facilities and transportation pipelines.

""Meanwhile, introduction of various new policies concerning the oil mining sector led to deferment of tendering activities. As of now, the project schedules are being maintained as planned. However, due to very complex nature of the project, there is a possibility that the schedules may get exhausted which will only be known at a later date,"" it had said.

The company had not given details of the policy changes. The delay will be for the second time due to government policies. ONGC had in 2014 announced plans to start gas production from 2018 and oil by 2019 but a final investment decision was made contingent upon government approving a remunerative price for the deepsea block as the prevalent rates were uneconomical.

But it was not before March 2016 that the government announced a new pricing formula for difficult areas, giving developers more than double the domestic rate.

Immediately after that ONGC Board approved the investment plan for Cluster-II group of discoveries in KG-D5.

The 7,294.6 sq km deepsea KG-D5 block has been broadly categorised into Northern Discovery Area (NDA - 3,800.6 sq km) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA - 3,494 sq km). The NDA has 11 oil and gas discoveries while SDA has the nation's only ultra-deepsea gas find of UD-1. These finds have been clubbed in three groups - Cluster-1, Cluster-II and Cluster-III.

Gas discovery in Cluster-I is to be tied up with finds in neighbouring G-4 block for production but this is not being taken up because of a dispute with RIL over migration of gas from ONGC blocks. From Cluster-II, a peak oil output of 77,305 barrels per day is envisaged within two years of start of production.

Gas output is slated to peak to 16.56 million standard cubic meters per day by end-2021. Cluster-2A mainly comprises oil finds of A2, P1, M3, M1 and G-2-2 in NDA which can produce 77,305 bpd (3.86 million tonnes per annum) and 3.81 mmscmd of gas. Cluster 2B, which is made up of four gas finds - R1, U3, U1, and A1 in NDA - envisages a peak output of 12.75 mmscmd of gas. Peak output is likely to last 7 years.

Cluster-3 is the UD-1 gas discovery in SDA. UD-1 lies in water depth of 2400-3200 meters and its development would be taken up after an appropriate technology is found.",680,-0.9889181852340698

ONGC, India's biggest explorer, has shortlisted U.S. oil service companies Halliburton, Schlumberger and GE subsidiary Baker Hughes to submit proposals on boosting production from two onshore fields, according to a document seen by Reuters.

The three companies have until May to submit their proposals for what ONGC is calling a ""production enhancement contract"" for an oilfield in Assam and another in Gujarat.

""The shortlist is ready. We will now share our data on the two fields with these companies,"" an ONGC executive said.

The executive - who did not wish to be named as ONGC has yet to make an official announcement - said the final contract is likely to be awarded by May.

Emails to Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes requesting comment on their participation were unanswered outside of U.S. business hours.

SOARING DEMAND, STRUGGLING OUTPUT

The government last September proposed selling a 60 percent stake in ONGC's producing fields to foreign companies to ramp up domestic oil and gas output and meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of cutting oil imports 10 percent by 2022.

India's oil production has stalled below 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in recent years, even as oil demand has surged. That has resulted in its crude oil imports soaring, making it the world's third-biggest importer, behind China and the United States. In January, India's imports hit a record of almost 5 million bpd.

ONGC, which the government hopes to eventually build into a global giant like Exxon Mobil or a state-owned oil major like PetroChina, has often been criticized by analysts and New Delhi for failing to increase its production.

ONGC's output - most of it from fields that have been operating for more than 30 years - is declining at the rate of 7 to 8 percent a year. A major part of the company's capital expenditure is spent in efforts to pump more oil and gas to set off the yearly decline.

For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, ONGC's standalone crude oil production stood at 20.855 million metric tonnes (417,000 bpd), one percent fall from the previous year.

Once the final contractor is chosen in May, the winning service company will be responsible for maintaining production at current levels, and also for boosting output incrementally from the two mature fields, the ONGC executive said.

""We will reimburse the operational expenses incurred and share some pre-determined amount on each barrel of incremental crude that the contractor will produce,"" the executive said.

Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes will get access to ONGC's data rooms pertaining to its Kalol field in Gujarat and the Geleki field in Assam before submitting a final bid, according to the bidding document.

ONGC might replicate the model for other fields if this pilot exercise is a success, the executive said.

ONGC explored a similar move in 2016 and had signed agreements with Halliburton and Schlumberger aimed at enhancing production, but the agreements were later cancelled, according to reports in local media.",536,-0.22489229838053384

The Centre on Wednesday sought a report from Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL) on the explosion and fire on an under repair ONGC drill ship that claimed five lives, even as a preliminary probe suggested it was caused by 'momentary explosion of high impact'.

Minister of State for Shipping Pon Radhakrishnan visited the shipyard this morning and took stock of the situation on board ""Sagar Bhushan,"" a day after the ONGC ship was hit by the explosion.

""The Minister instructed CSL to conduct a thorough investigation and ascertain the root cause and report the details to Ministry of Shipping,"" a CSL statement said here.

The condition of one of the seriously injured persons continues to be critical, the company said.

After the review and interactions, Radhakrishnan directed CSL to extend additional assistance to the affected, including employment as appropriate, based on qualification, to one immediate dependent family member of the deceased.

Talking to reporters, the Minister said there was an explosion, but no sign of fire inside the ship.

He said CSL on its part has begun a high-level internal inquiry into the incident. Technical investigations are being carried out by the DG Shipping and Factories and Boilers Department, he said.

""Police is also taking all steps. After the enquiry only we can find out the reasons for the explosion,"" the Minister said, after visiting the injured at a hospital here.

CSL said the Director, Factories and Boilers, visited the spot and recorded his observations.

""As per the preliminary assessment, the accident has been caused by a momentary explosion of high impact that has occurred near the A/C plant, which is situated above the Ballast Tank,"" the CSL statement quoted him as saying.

The probable location of the explosion was identified, based on the nature of deflections on bulkheads (steel walls) and extent of damage observed during inspection, it said.

The site of the accident has been cordoned off and is being investigated by the forensic department of police. The company said the source of gas leakage and reason for the explosion was yet to be confirmed and would be clarified only after completion of it's internal enquiry.

""The accident is observed to have happened near the A/C plant when the area was being inspected by CSL Fire and Safety personnel prior to issuing work permit for starting of the work,"" the company said.

In a statement yesterday, CSL had said five people died and seven were injured in the incident.

The Minister appreciated the efforts of the CSL management in reaching out to the families of the deceased and also for promptly announcing ex-gratia to their kith and kin.

CSL had declared Rs 10 lakh to the family of the deceased in addition to other statutory benefits as applicable. An amount of Rs 25,000 was disbursed as immediate incidental expenses to the families of the deceased.

The company is also ensuring best medical care and meeting all hospital/treatment expenses for the injured.

Radhakrishnan also directed that an amount equivalent to two months wages be disbursed immediately, besides appropriate education assistance for children of the deceased up to completion of degree level education. In addition to the statutory compensation relief, CSL should disburse wages to the injured till they return to work, he said.

During the interaction with the unions and associations, Radhakrishnan and the CSL Chairman and Managing Director Madhu S Nair promised adequate support to all affected families.

The employees also appreciated the management for the positive and prompt response in the aftermath of the accident.

Head of Mercantile Marine Department in Kochi, which is under the DG Shipping, Ajithkumar Sukumaran, said its probe would cover all aspects, including lapses, if any, that had occurred in conducting mandatory safety and security checks before commencing the repairing job.

CSL said the ONGC vessel had arrived at Cochin Shipyard on December 7, 2017 for dry dock repairs. It was dry-docked on January 12, 2018 and was to be undocked on February 28, 2018. Work completion was scheduled by April 7, 2018.",675,-0.241781941481999

2018-02-11 14:40:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-nominate-one-director-on-hpcl-board-2505427.html,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is likely to nominate one director on the board of recently acquired Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) while retaining all the present directors of the company.

ONGC late last month completed the acquisition of the government's 51.11 percent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore. HPCL is now a subsidiary of ONGC.

Like its other major subsidiaries -- Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) and ONGC Videsh Ltd, ONGC is likely to nominate just one director on the board of HPCL, sources privy to the development said.

HPCL board currently has four functional directors besides the Chairman and Managing Director. It also has two government nominee directors and six independent directors.

Sources said the Articles of Association of HPCL provide for the board to be made up of a maximum of 20 directors, including independent ones.

ONGC can theoretically speaking, nominate more than one director but such nomination would have to be matched by an appointment of an equal number of independent directors, they said.

So, while ONGC can nominate 3 directors, it may eventually name only one, they added.

MRPL and OVL both have just the ONGC Chairman and Managing Director on their board which has Managing Director and functional directors.

Both the firms have government nominee directors and so the two government nominee directors on HPCL board would also continue, sources said.

Since HPCL by virtue of 51 per cent shareholding of ONGC, continues to be a central public sector enterprise (CPSE), its board members would continue to be appointed by the government.

Sources said the only question that remains is of the status of HPCL Chairman and Managing Director.

While ONGC's present subsidiaries MRPL and OVL are headed by Managing Directors with ONGC Chairman being the company chairman, there is a thought that HPCL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Kumar Surana may be allowed to hold his designation and the Coal India Ltd (CIL) model for governance of subsidiaries is followed.

CIL, the world's largest coal producer, is the holding company whose board is headed by a Chairman and Managing Director. It has eight subsidiaries like Eastern Coalfields Ltd and Bharat Coking Coal Ltd, all of whom have a board headed by Chairman and Managing Director. The Chairman and Managing Directors of the subsidiaries report to CIL head.

Sources said if this model is followed, Surana will continue as Chairman and Managing Director of HPCL who would report to ONGC head Shashi Shanker.

Prior to the stake sale, the government made it clear that HPCL would continue to be a central public sector enterprise (CPSE), retaining its separate identity and brand and will be independently run by its board.

The alternate governance model has been thrown as a large section in ONGC feels that HPCL should be governed on lines of the company's other subsidiaries like ONGC Videsh Ltd, which have an independent board and a Managing Director or CEO as heads. These heads of subsidiaries report to ONGC Chairman and Managing Director.

Sources said following the CIL-model of governance would save Surana, who is senior to Shanker, the blushes of a designation downgrade.",524,

OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and a unit of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), paid a signing amount of USD 600 million for a 10 percent stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil Co's (ADNOC) 40-year Lower Zakum Concession, Offshore Abu Dhabi.

""The current production of this field is about 400,000 barrels of oil per day (20 million tonnes per annum) and Indian consortium's annual share shall be about 2 million tonnes,"" OVL said in a press statement.

The field is to achieve plateau target of 450,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025.

The contract for the concession was signed in Abu Dhabi last evening in presence of Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

This is the first time that Indian oil companies have taken part in an Abu Dhabi oil and gas concession.

The concession, which has a term of 40 years with an effective date of March 9, 2018, was signed by ONGC Group Chairman Shashi Shanker and ADNOC Group Chief Executive Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber.

""ADNOC is finalising the potential partners for the remaining 30 percent of the available 40 percent stake in the Lower Zakum Concession earmarked for international oil and gas companies,"" the statement said.

The deal ""will help India meet its growing demand for energy and refined products, create opportunities for ADNOC to increase its market share in a key growth market, and build a solid foundation as ADNOC explores potential international investments, particularly focused on downstream opportunities,"" Sultan al-Jaber said.

Shanker hoped that the historic agreement will lead to further opportunities for Indian oil and gas companies to participate in the UAE's energy sector.

""The agreement reflects the vision of the Prime Minister of India towards strengthening hydrocarbon linkages with the UAE on a win-win basis,"" he said.

ADNOC chief executive said the pact supports company's strategy to maximise economic value and recovery from its offshore oil and gas resources. ""This is an attractive and strategic agreement for both parties that will deliver competitive returns and long-term growth opportunities.""

ADNOC had in August last year said that it would split its ADMA-OPCO offshore concession into three areas - Lower Zakum, Umm Shaif and Nasr, and Sateh Al Razboot and Umm Lulu - with new terms to unlock greater value and increase opportunities for partnerships.

""The present transaction marks the entry of OVL in highly prospective UAE region and is consistent with its stated strategic objective of adding high quality producing assets to its existing oil and gas exploration and production portfolio,"" the statement said.

OVL is India's largest international oil and gas company, having 39 projects in 18 countries, including Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Mozambique, Myanmar, Russia, South Sudan, Sudan, Namibia, Venezuela, Vietnam and New Zealand.

It currently produces about 277,000 barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas per day and has total oil and gas reserves (2P) of about 704 million tonnes of oil equivalent as on April 1, 2017.

ADNOC will have 60 percent stake in the existing ADMA- OPCO concession, which produces around 700,000 barrels per day of oil and is projected to reach about 1 million barrels per day 2021.

Existing shareholders in ADMA-OPCO are BP plc with 14.67 percent, Total SA with 13.33 percent and Japan Oil Development Co with 12 percent.",600,0.9923316836357117

The price paid is higher than Rs 396.50 closing price of HPCL on the BSE.

The transaction will help the government cross its annual sell-off (disinvestment) target for the first ever time.

ONGC has borrowed money from a clutch of banks to fund the deal.

Through this acquisition, ONGC will become India's first vertically integrated 'oil major' company, having a presence across the entire value chain. The integrated entity will have an advantage of having enhanced capacity to bear higher risks and take higher investment decisions etc.

In this process, ONGC has acquired significant mid-stream and downstream capacity and will attain economies of scale at various levels of operations.

Rating agency Moody's today affirmed the ratings for state-run ONGC as 'stable' following the oil major's recent acquisition of majority shareholding in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL).

The transaction remains subject to requisite approvals from the shareholders of ONGC.

ONGC has acquired 51.11 per cent equity stake in HPCL from the centre for a consideration of Rs 36,915 crore to be paid in cash by January 31, this year.

""Moody's Investors Service, affirmed Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd's (ONGC) 'Baa1' local and foreign currency issuer ratings, and the 'Baa1' ratings on the senior unsecured bonds issued by ONGC Videsh Ltd and ONGC Videsh Vankorneft Pte Ltd, both guaranteed by ONGC,"" the rating agency said.

""The outlook on all ratings is stable,"" it added. ONGC's 'Baa1' issuer ratings are primarily driven by its standalone credit profile.

Moody's noted that ratings reflects ONGC's position as the only integrated oil and gas company in India with significant reserves, production and crude distillation capacity, post the acquisition. Besides, it also incorporates substantial operating cash flow generation capacity as well as weakened but still appropriate credit metrics for its ratings following the HPCL acquisition.

Further, Moody's expects that the company will not be asked to share fuel subsidies as long as the oil prices stay below USD 60-65 per barrel.

""The rating outlook is stable reflecting Moody's expectation that the company will lower its borrowings through sale of stake in IOC and GAIL,"" the agency said.

""Further, the stable outlook also incorporates our expectation of benign oil price environment and that the company's growth plan will continue to be executed within the tolerance level of its current ratings,"" it added.

However, the agency noted that likelihood of a ratings upgrade for ONGC in the next 12 -18 months remains low given the high leverage.

Moody's said that ONGC may finance HPCL equity stake will be funded by up to Rs 25,000 crore of incremental borrowings, with the balance being cash on hand.

""The payment of acquisition price will result in ONGC's net borrowings increasing by Rs 36,915 crore, irrespective of the mix of debt and cash used for such payment,"" it said.

Accordingly, post-acquisition, ONGC's proforma net borrowings for the fiscal year ending March 2018 will increase to Rs 1,26,500 crore as against Rs 47,200 crore without the acquisition.

It can be noted, post-acquisition the ONGC board had approved fresh debt raising of Rs 35,000 crore.

""ONGC's proforma credit metrics for fiscal 2018 will also weaken with retained cash flow/net debt declining to 28 per cent from 68 per cent without the acquisition,"" the agency said.",441,0.018194451928138733

As the crude oil prices rise, the government may ask upstream firms like ONGC to bear a part of the kerosene and LPG subsidies, India Ratings and Research said today.

Producers Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd as well as gas utility GAIL were in past asked to bear between one-third to half of the under-recovery fuel retailers incurred on selling LPG and kerosene below market rate.

This subsidy sharing scheme ended last fiscal.

In a statement on its view on ONGC buying out HPCL, India Ratings said given the sharp increase in international crude price, oil marketing companies may be required to bear a part of the under-recoveries.

This would be on the lines of past when the government capped the subsidy burden it was willing to share per kilogram and per litre on LPG and kerosene, respectively.

Any under-recovery over and above the level up to which the government can bear is to be borne by upstream and oil marketing companies, it said.

""Although there is no mathematical basis for deciding the share of the subsidy to be borne by upstream or oil marketing companies, upstream companies have historically shared the bulk of the remaining subsidy burden post the government share,"" it said.

India Ratings said ONGC's acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) will be credit neutral for ratings of HPCL.

ONGC, which is 68.94 per cent owned by the government, will acquire the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore.

""Thus, the government of India will indirectly own 35.23 per cent in HPCL,"" it said in a statement.

Despite the change in ownership, HPCL will continue to operate as a separate entity with a strong brand. Its strategic importance to the government is likely to remain intact, given the company's role as the State's extended arm for fuel policy implementation.

""The acquisition of HPCL is likely to result in additional borrowings for ONGC,"" India Ratings said, adding that the state-owned oil producer is likely to fund the acquisition by end-January 2018.

It could use one or more of the three sources for funding -- fresh debt, cash and cash equivalents, and monetisation of its stake in entities such as GAIL, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Petronet LNG Ltd.

The combined value of its stake in the three entities is about Rs 34,400 crore.

For HPCL, the acquisition may result in some synergies in crude oil procurement with Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, which is 71.63 per cent owned by ONGC.

HPCL, along with HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd and MRPL, represented 15.3 per cent of India's total crude import volume of 249 million tonne.

Also, HPCL may be able to capitalise on ONGC's petrochemical expertise while expanding its footprint in the segment.

""The acquisition may result in the merger of MPRL with HPCL. This would be beneficial as it would allow the combined entity to leverage its purchasing power,"" India Ratings said.

The combined entity would be the third-largest refiner in India, with a refining capacity of 43.1 million tones, behind IOC's 80.8 million tonnes and Reliance Industries Ltd's 62 million tonnes.

India Ratings said HPCL may have to resort to additional borrowings in case it was to acquire ONGC's stake in MRPL for cash. ONGC's stake in MRPL is worth Rs 16,400 crore.

""Moreover, HPCL may consider a combination of share swap and cash payout, where ONGC would get additional stake in HPCL against its shareholding in MRPL,"" the rating agency said.

ONGC-HPCL deal is unlikely to alter government subsidies for kerosene and LPG.",606,0.49998998641967773

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) today said it has tied-up over Rs 18,000 crore loan from three banks to part finance its Rs 36,915 crore acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL).

In a regulatory filing, ONGC said it had yesterday entered into loan agreements with Punjab National Bank, Bank of India and Axis Bank Ltd for the borrowing Rs 18,060 crore for the acquisition.

ONGC said the loans are of one-year duration. The pact with PNB is for loan of up to Rs 10,600 crore and with Bank of India for another Rs 4,460 crore.

With Axis Bank it has secured Rs 3,000 crore credit.

The company is likely to sign-up more loan agreements to pay for acquiring government's 51.11 percent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore.

ONGC is to pay the government for the stake within this month.

The acquisition would create India's first integrated oil company. This would be ONGC's biggest acquisition and second buyout this fiscal after its Rs 7,738 crore acquisition of 80 percent stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's KG basin gas block.

ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker had on Sunday stated that the company's board has approved raising of the borrowing limit from Rs 25,000 crore to Rs 35,000 crore.

This will be the company's first ever debt.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has got approval from the government for selling its stake in IOC and GAIL to help fund the Rs 36,915 crore acquisition of HPCL.

ONGC holds 13.77 per cent stake in nation's biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC), which at today's trading price is worth over Rs 26,200 crore. It also holds 4.86 per cent stake in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, which is worth over Rs 3,847 crore.

Top sources with direct knowledge of the issue said the government gave ONGC nod to sell its shareholding in IOC and GAIL earlier this month but the company is waiting for the right price to offload the shares.

For the moment ONGC is funding the Rs 36,915 crore acquisition of government's 51.11 per cent stake in oil refining and marketing firm Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) from the about Rs 12,000 crore cash it has and short- term borrowing.

Sources said ONGC is a zero-debt company and wants to retain that status. The short-term loan it is availing have provision to pre-pay without any penalty.

It plans to pre-pay the one-year tenure loan it is taking for HPCL buy by selling IOC and GAIL shares in due course, they said.

Sources said ONGC had held talks with Life Insurance Corp of India (LIC) for selling IOC and GAIL shares but the state- owned insurer insisted on buying them at 10 per cent discount to the prevailing price.

So, ONGC has decided to offload the shares in open market.

ONGC acquiring HPCL would create India's first integrated oil company. This would be ONGC's biggest acquisition and second buyout this fiscal after its Rs 7,738 crore acquisition of 80 per cent stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's KG basin gas block.

ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker had on Sunday stated that the company's board has approved raising of the borrowing limit from Rs 25,000 crore to Rs 35,000 crore.

""This order can change, because we won't sell the liquid assets in distress. Also, we have offers for over Rs 50,000 crore debt at very competitive rates, both foreign currency and local.""

Shanker had said the company paid less than the acquisition price recommended by the company's valuation adviser, EY.

He, however, refused to share details.

The Rs 473.97 per share ONGC is paying to the government is 14 per cent higher than Friday's closing price of HPCL and over 10 per cent of the 60-day weighted average of the HPCL scrip.

Sources said while the government was seeking as much as Rs 69,000 crore for selling controlling stake in HPCL, EY had put HPCL's valuation at Rs 475 a share plus a premium for getting the controlling stake. The outside advice the company took from Citi put the price at Rs 500 per share.

The stake sale will help the government cross its sell- off target for the first time and would help stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.2 per cent of GDP.

The government had set a target of Rs 72,500 crore from disinvestment proceeds this fiscal. Before the ONGC-HPCL deal, it had collected Rs 54,337.60 crore.

HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.

India could see more integration among state oil companies, its oil minister said on Monday, following top producer ONGC's $5.8 billion deal last week to buy a majority stake in refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd.

India wants to build bigger oil companies to better compete with global energy giants and withstand oil price volatility through integration of state-run oil firms.

""There is scope for more vertical integration in the sector,"" oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told a news conference.

He was speaking after Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) announced on Saturday that it was buying the government's 51.1 percent stake in HPCL to create India's first integrated oil and gas company.

Analysts have said that an integrated oil company would give Indian state-owned firms a bigger balance sheet to compete globally for assets.

Last year state-run refiners Indian Oil Corp Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd separately expressed interest in buying the government's stakes in explorer Oil India Ltd and gas utility GAIL India Ltd.

ONGC's purchase of a majority stake in HPCL is expected to close by the end of this month and Pradhan said there was a possibility to combine HPCL with ONGC's petrochemical projects and its refining arm Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd.

MRPL operates a 300,000 bpd refinery in the southern state of Karnataka.

After the deal, ONGC will control around 17 percent of India's 5 million bpd or so refining capacity.

JP Morgan has maintained ‘Overweight’ on Axis Bank and has raised price target to Rs 700 from Rs 650. It expects guidance of 225-260 basis points with normalised credit costs and sees the next 2-3 quarters as challenging given the uncertainty over timing and quantum of back-book provisioning.

At about 2 times price-to-book and a FY20 return on equity estimate of 19.5 percent, Axis Bank is the house's top value pick.

Morgan Stanley has also maintained ‘Overweight’ on Axis Bank with price target Rs 770. It is of the view that impaired loans showed good trends after a weak December quarter and expects asset quality and core pre-provision operating profit trends to be volatile over the next four quarters with continued improvement in impaired loans over the next four quarters which should drive strong stock performance over the next 12 months.

2018-01-22 20:15:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/dharmendra-pradhan-justifies-exempting-ongc-from-open-offer-for-hpcl-2488587.html,"Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan today cited the four-decade-old Nationalisation Act to justify exempting ONGC from making an open offer after acquiring the government's 51.11 percent stake in HPCL.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) acquired government's 51.11 percent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore but unlike similar deals, it did not make an open offer to buy an additional 26 percent stake from minority shareholders of HPCL.

""We are bound by the Nationalisation Act and character of HPCL could not have changed so no open offer was mandated,"" Pradhan told reporters here.

HPCL came into existence in 1974 when the government took over erstwhile Esso Standard and Lube India Ltd and nationalised it through the ESSO (Acquisition of Undertaking in India) Act passed by Parliament.

The Supreme Court had in 2003 cited this law and the Burma Shell (Acquisition of Undertaking in India) Act, 1976 and Caltex (Acquisition of Shares of Caltex Oil Refining India Ltd and all the Undertakings in India for Caltex India Ltd) Act, 1977 to rule that the government cannot privatise HPCL and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) without approaching the Parliament for changing the nationalisation act.

While Pradhan said Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) will continue to remain a central public sector enterprise (CPSE) by virtue of government holding majority stake in ONGC, he did not say as to how the character of HPCL would have changed if ONGC's shareholding in HPCL would have increased to 77 percent after the open offer.

Rules currently state that a subsidiary, in which a PSU holds more than 50 percent stake, is a state-owned firm.

Asked how the ONGC-HPCL deal was different from Indian Oil Corp (IOC) in 2002 taking over fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd in 2002, he said, ""HPCL is governed by nationalisation act.""

The government had reasoned exemption from open offer saying ""the management complexion is not changing. So it is a related party transaction"".

Way back in February 2002, state-owned IOC had acquired government's 33.58 percent stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd for Rs 1,153.68 crore and had to make an open offer for additional shares.

As per Sebi's takeover code, if a company acquires more than 25 percent in another listed company, it has to make an open offer to minority shareholders to buy at least 26 percent more in the target firm.

Had similar rules applied to ONGC, it would have had to shell out an additional Rs 18,800 crore in offering the same Rs 473.97 per share to minority shareholders.

Officials said ONGC will not have to make an open offer to minority shareholders of HPCL as the government's holding is being transferred to another state-run firm and the ownership isn't really changing.

Pradhan said HPCL will continue to be a separately listed company even after ONGC acquisition.

Government is 51 percent owner of HPCL and 68 percent owner of ONGC.

The deal, which flows from Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's Budget announcement of creating an integrated oil company, will help ONGC spread its risks.

From being a mere oil and gas producer, it will also have downstream oil refining and fuel retailing business, Pradhan said.

HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refinery in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.

ONGC already is a majority owner of MRPL, which has a 15- million tonne refinery.",568,0.9488418102264404

After a gap of over three- decades, state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is set to open a new sedimentary basin in the country as it puts Kutch offshore on the oil and gas map of India.

Kutch would be India's eighth sedimentary basin. ONGC had previously opened for commercial production six out of India's seven producing basins. Cauvery was the last Category-I producing basin which was discovered in 1985.

ONGC has made a significant natural gas discovery in the Gulf of Kutch off the west coast, which it plans to bring to production in 2-3 years, senior company officials said.

India has 26 sedimentary basins, of which only seven have commercial production of oil and gas. Except for the Assam shelf, ONGC opened up for commercial production all the other six basins, including Cambay, Mumbai Offshore, Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari, Cauvery and Assam-Arakan Fold Belt.

The discovery in Kutch offshore may hold about 1 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.

The spread of Kutch offshore basin covers an area of 28000 square kilometres in water depth of up to 200 meters and will become eighth producing basin of the country.

Talking about the possibility of adding new basin for production, ONGC Director (Exploration) A K Dwivedi said: ""The results are very encouraging and I am sure that this is going to open up many new opportunities"".

He said several state-of-the-art technologies like broadband seismic acquisition have been used in exploration campaign to acquire more accurate data from the exploration acreages.

While congratulating the exploration Team, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker said, ""Our constant efforts will be on looking for new opportunities to replenish our reserves. Our focus is to improve the quality of pre- drilling data through the use of innovative technologies in order to improve the success rate.""

Exploration, he said, is the most important value creator for any E&P company worldwide.

""ONGC will leave no stone unturned to improve success rate from its exploratory campaigns. We are trying to optimize cost as much as possible, both during pre and post exploratory drilling phases,"" he said.

However, imbibing most modern technologies as well as conducting a customized training programme for the geoscientists to substantially enhance the quality of data before exploratory drilling starts are needed, he said. ""This will have a huge positive impact both in short and long run.""

In order to go for early monetising of Kutch Offshore, ONGC is looking for pricing support from the Government of India. Since Kutch Offshore is a difficult field, its cost of production is also going to be high. Hence, a matching pricing support is extremely important.

Officials said the present government-mandated gas price of USD 2.89 per million British thermal unit does not make the discovery commercially viable. Since the find is in shallow waters, it does not qualify to get the USD 6.30 per mmBtu cap price set for difficult fields.

ONGC, they said, has stepped up the acquisition of 2D and 3D seismic data in a bid to raise production and help cut country's dependence on imports to meet oil needs by 10 per cent by 2022.

In 2017, the company acquired around 7000 square kilometre of 3D seismic data.

Officials said 37 discoveries have been made in last two years. 17 of these are onland, 18 in shallow water and two are deepsea discoveries.

Also, a framework for monetisation of 166 new and small discoveries have been mapped at the Basin and Asset level, they added.",593,0.6306470394134521

Credit Suisse maintains a cautiously optimistic outlook on Indian equities, but a sustained or a sharp correction on D-Street is unlikely as domestic flows remain strong while a solid global growth outlook should be supportive for risky assets.

Amid high valuations and a volatile macro environment, Credit Suisse recommends investors to focus on long-term structural themes that have been shaping up in India.

Investors can build their portfolios around these themes, which we believe can potentially outperform the market in the medium term, it said in a report authored by Jitendra Gohil, Head of India Equity Research at Credit Suisse.

Here is a list of top 5 themes which investors can watch out in the year 2018:

Rural demand revival and financial inclusion:

Credit Suisse is positive on demand revival in rural and semi-urban areas. For the past couple of years, monsoon has been relatively good. Ahead of the general elections in summer of 2019, the government could take speedy measures to improve growth in rural and semi-urban areas, in our view.

Moreover, benefits of the 7th Pay Commission, farm loan waiver, record-high MANREGA allocation, etc. should provide a fillip to overall demand in 2018.

Credit Suisse likes Emami, Dabur India (HOLD), PI Industries (BUY) and Hero MotoCorp (HOLD), which are best positioned to benefit from rural demand revival.

Moreover, there is a huge scope for retail lending to improve, especially in rural and semi-urban areas, as penetration levels in India remain abysmally low.

Within retail lenders, Credit Suisse prefers rural and semi-urban lenders where there is maximum stress right now. Structurally, the global investment bank likes Shriram City Union Finance (BUY) and Cholamandalam Investment and Finance (BUY).

It reiterates BUY on Edelweiss, the largest ARC in the country, as Credit Suisse believes that the company will continue to demonstrate stellar growth in its credit as well as non-credit businesses (Net profit CAGR of over 50 percent in FY 2017– 2019E).

Progress on affordable housing is encouraging:

Credit Suisse expects the government to accelerate spending on affordable housing, which can create goodwill among voters and help create job opportunities as the construction sector is the second-largest employer after agriculture in India.

The global brokerage firm prefers housing finance companies, among which Indiabulls Housing Finance (BUY) and PNB Housing Finance (HOLD) are top picks. There are several industries such as paints, tiles, cement, faucets, white goods, cement, etc. that depend on the real estate sector.

Credit Suisse remains positive on Pidilite Industries (BUY), Kajaria Ceramics (HOLD), Shree Cements (BUY), Crompton Greaves Consumer (BUY) and Voltas (BUY).

Infrastructure and capital goods in a sweet spot:

As per IMF projections, India could spend on infrastructure on an average 8.1 percent of GDP per year from current fiscal year to 2022 compared to just over 5 percent a few years ago.

This accelerated spending along with policy support and international financing could potentially transform India’s infrastructure landscape. Apart from budgetary support, we expect the government to push public sector companies (PSU) to spend more or pay higher dividends.

Credit Suisse is positive on Larsen and Toubro (BUY), KEC International (BUY), Sadbhav Engineering (BUY), Dilip Buildcon (BUY) and VA Tech Wabag (BUY).

The energy sector continues to attract attention:

India is a net importer of oil and gas, and the sector has remained under-invested for years now. Credit Suisse expects the government to provide a favorable policy framework to attract more investments and improve energy infrastructure in India for curbing imports and moving toward energy independence.

In terms of gas sector reforms, Credit Suisse prefers ONGC (BUY), which will benefit from a better policy framework. Within oil marketing companies, we prefer Indian Oil Corporation (BUY), which will benefit from expansion and lower valuation.

NPA resolution will be keenly watched:

Stressed assets (NPA, restructured, etc.) in the Indian banking system are estimated at 14 percent of total loans. Starting June 2017, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a direction to banks to refer 40 cases to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for bankruptcy proceedings if they along with resolution professionals fail to finalize a resolution plan within the stipulated 270 days.

Progress on the resolution of most of these accounts has been better than expected so far, especially in case of the steel sector where banks have received multiple “Expression of Interests.”

Credit Suisse believes that State Bank of India (BUY) is best positioned to benefit from large accounts’ resolutions.

ONGC will have to pay a premium to acquire Centre’s 51.1 percent stake in oil marketing company Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) under the proposed deal.

Financial Express reports that ONGC may have to pay the government approximately Rs 45,000 crore for taking controlling stake in the latter firm that is Rs 14,500 crore more than the estimated Rs 31,000-31,500 crore at the present valuation and a 45 percent premium over its current market capitalisation.

The deal received the government’s nod in July of last year after the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget 2017 speech announced its plan to create an oil behemoth that will compete with international and domestic private oil companies.

It has been reported in some publication that oil ministry has raised concerns over the valuation of the deal and wanted to wait for a while to allow ONGC to raise enough funds.

The oil explorer has internally valued HPCL at a higher valuation than the current market price and is likely to pay the government through a mix of internal resources and debt raised through bonds.

The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has appointed JM Financial as the financial advisor and Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas as the legal consultant. While ONGC appointed SBICAP and Citigroup as merchant bankers for the deal and Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas as the legal adviser.

The deal is likely to help the government to meet its divestment target for the current financial year of Rs 72,500 crore of which it has so far raised Rs 54,000 crore. The fund received by the Centre would help in controlling the fiscal deficit.",282,-0.0007895827293395996

In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, he said the discovery was made in the well WO-24-3 (WO-24-C) drilled west of Mumbai High fields.

Though a holiday was declared for Parliament, replies to questions were posted on the Lok Sabha website.

""Based on the data generated during drilling, 9 objects/zones were identified and on testing all the objects flowed oil/gas,"" he said.

The discovery has indicated potential in-place reserves of about 29.74 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas, he said.

""The 9th object on testing flowed oil at the rate of 3,310 barrels per day and gas at the rate of 17,071 cubic meters per day,"" the minister said. ""This multi-layered oil and gas accumulation in this well opened up a new area for exploration/development.""

Mumbai High, India's biggest oil field, currently produces 205,000 barrels of oil per day (just over 10 million tonnes per annum) and the new find would add to that production in less than two years' time.

ONGC is carrying out a further appraisal of the discovery and has intimated upstream regulator the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).

The new find, which comes almost 50 years after ONGC began production in Mumbai High, will help the company maintain production levels from the basin for a longer time than currently estimated.

Mumbai High is ONGC's flagship oil producing assets. It along with other small fields along the western offshore produce 16 million tonnes per annum of oil, which is 44 percent of Indias total crude oil production of 36 million tonnes.

ONGC produced 25.5 million tonnes of oil in 2016-17, which will reach 28-29 million tonnes by 2019-20, officials said.",314,0.9999985694885254

Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) are both keen to acquire gas utility GAIL India Ltd to become fully integrated energy companies.

IOC and BPCL have separately indicated to the petroleum ministry their interest in taking over GAIL to help add natural gas transportation and marketing business to their kitty, official sources said.

GAIL, on the other hand, feels a merger with oil and gas producer ONGC would be more appropriate.

The merger options were indicated following Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's announcement in the 2017-18 Budget speech on the government's plan to create integrated public sector oil majors that will be ""able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies"".

ONGC, India's largest oil and gas producer, proposed to acquire oil refiner and fuel marketing company HPCL, which was approved by the Cabinet. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is currently in the process of acquiring the government's 51.11 percent stake in HPCL, which at current prices is worth over Rs 33,000 crore.

Sources said IOC and BPCL gave separate options for the integration.

The government's 54.89 percent stake in GAIL is currently worth about Rs 46,700 crore.

Integration options suggested by other companies would be taken up only after ONGC-HPCL merger is complete, they said.

IOC, the largest oil refiner and fuel marketing company in the country, wanted to either acquire another refiner to add to its capacity or a gas company like GAIL.

The firm feels it already has a fledging gas business in under-construction LNG terminals, city gas distribution projects and gas marketing. GAIL, the nation's biggest gas transporter and marketing company, would complement that, it felt.

BPCL on the other hand too has natural gas ambitions and wrote to the oil ministry saying GAIL was its number one choice for acquisition. It listed Oil India Ltd (OIL), the nation's second largest exploration firm, as its number two choice.

The government holds 66.13 percent stake in OIL, which at current market price is worth about Rs 18,000 crore.

GAIL feels merger with ONGC makes more sense as such a move would integrate gas producer with transportation and marketing network.

Sources said the government has not taken any decision on the proposals sent by other PSUs.

The government is keen on the PSU-PSU merger or integration options as it would help it cash out on its holding yet retain its control.

Also, it would help build bigger oil companies to better compete with global giants and withstand oil price volatility.",434,0.9417567849159241

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has sought access to a data room to help fix the price at which it can acquire government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL.

India's largest oil and gas producer has so far been given an information memorandum (IM) by government's transaction advisor which ONGC feels is not sufficient to arrive at a valuation of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), sources privy to the development said.

ONGC, they said, wants to better understand HPCL's financials, particularly the investments it has committed in projects like a greenfield refinery at Barmer in Rajasthan, before it embarks on buying the government stake which at today's price is worth over Rs 32,600 crore.

Sources said ONGC wants to do a proper due diligence on HPCL and access to data room is a prerequisite for that.

HPCL already has a data room and will give access to the same to ONGC if the seller (government) so desires, a company official said.

The official said the company has already shared information with government's transaction advisor and it is ready to share more if the need arises.

Previously, the government was of the view that ONGC should arrive at a valuation of HPCL based on the publicly available information. The bulk of IM is made up of publicly available information.

Sources said ONGC wants a better fix at the kind of money it will need to invest in HPCL post acquisition and so wants access to data room.

The Cabinet on July 19 approved the sale of government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC as part of its Rs 72,500 crore disinvestment target for the current fiscal, 2017-18.

Transaction advisors were appointed in August and it was expected that an IM containing detailed information on HPCL's assets and liabilities would be handed over to ONGC by mid- September so as to help it firm up a value for the stake buy.

Originally, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which is managing the sale, was keen to close the transaction in October or November itself but it managed to send the IM to ONGC only on October 31.

Sources said in a typical strategic stake sale, the government opens data room for potential acquirers to access information on the target company.

But in case of HPCL, this is being done on the basis of largely publicly known information that has been put in IM.

JM Financial is DIPAM's transaction advisor for the stake sale while Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas is the legal advisor.

With ONGC and HPCL under the administrative control of the oil ministry, the latter has appointed 'Protocol Valuers Ltd' for suggesting valuation at which the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL should be sold to ONGC.

ONGC has appointed CitiGroup and SBI Caps as its transaction advisors.",485,

The government should privatise ONGC rather than give away its prime producing oil and gas fields to private companies ""for a song and bleed the PSU to death"", say company executives.

Selling just 18 percent out of the government's 68.07 percent shareholding in Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will fetch over Rs 41,000 crore at current market price, many times more than the investment commitment it may get from giving away 60 percent in 11 identified oil and gas fields of the company, they said.

Speaking to PTI on the condition of anonymity, a cross- section of ONGC employees, officials and executives expressed dismay at the move by Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) to handover 11 of the company's fields including Kalok, Ankleshwar, Gandhar and Santhal - the big four oilfields in Gujarat, to private sector on grounds of raising output. ""If they think ONGC is inefficient, the company should be privatised.

The proposed approach will only drive the company, which is India's most profitable PSU, the Air India way,"" one of them said. Cutting government stake to just one share less than 50 percent would give government enough revenues to meet its disinvestment target as well as bring in ""an efficient private sector management"", he said.

India has 0.3 percent of world's oil and gas reserves but produces 0.6 percent of global output, with ONGC accounting for the bulk of it, another official said.

He sought to debunk the theory that since the recovery at the state-owned firm's fields is low, it warrants involvement of private sector in raising production. ONGC, officials said, has maintained production levels despite most of its prime fields being in production for decades and natural decline setting.

""Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has been touting at public forums ONGC's 'stagnant' production being on the rise,"" one of them said.

Another official said that if drop in production is a criterion for getting so-called experts for raising production, eastern offshore KG-D6 gas fields in Bay of Bengal and Barmer oilfields in Rajasthan are the fit case.

These fields are just 8-10 years old but have seen considerable drop in production, he added. Natural gas output from the biggest gas field in the KG- D6 block is one-tenth since global major BP Plc came on board nearly seven years back, he said.

Another official cited the example of Panna/Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields in western offshore, which was taken away from ONGC in the 1990s and given to Enron Corp and Reliance Industries.

After Enron's bankruptcy, the fields were first operated by BG Group of UK and now under Royal Dutch Shell but the production has only fallen, leading to the partners deciding to relinquish one of the fields, he said.

The DGH wants private companies take 60 percent stake in producing oil and gas fields of national oil companies, ONGC and OIL, with the view that they would raise production above the baseline estimate. As many as 15 fields - 11 of ONGC and four of Oil India Ltd (OIL) - with a cumulative in place reserve of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas have been identified.

Another executive said the concept of the fields being given to ONGC on nomination basis is ""flawed"" as what the company got was barren piece of area where it invested capital, without seeking any budgetary support, to discover oil and gas and produce from them.

And these areas were given to ONGC in absence of any private or foreign company interest in exploring in India, he pointed out. According to the proposal made by DGH, ONGC/OIL fields would be auctioned and any firm committing the maximum capital investment within 10 years of the contract award and the largest share out of its net revenue to the government would be awarded the field.

The 15 fields selected are out of a review of 202 fields operated by the national oil companies. The fields chosen are ones that hold reserves of 20 or more million tonnes of oil equivalent (MT OE) and have crossed the half-way mark on a score (indicative of poor field performance) combining exploration index, current recovery, and production decline rate in the last three years.

Of the 202 fields, 141 are either less than 10 years of age or had shown some positive change in the year-on-year production rate. As many as 44 fields of ONGC and OIL have been identified for production enhancement work through Technical Services Model. Under this, technical tie-ups would get the 'tariff' that they bid as a return for increasing the output 'over the baseline production' for 10 years initially.

ONGC officers association has sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention to stall Oil Ministry's plan to sell the company's producing oil and gas fields, saying the move has highly damaging implications for the country.

The Association of Scientific & Technical Officers (ASTO) cited examples of falling production at the western offshore Panna/Mukta fields that were privatised in the 1990s, and Reliance Industries' flagging KG-D6 fields to state that ONGC has done well with its ageing fields.

Most oil and gas fields of ONGC have been in production for 30 years and output has naturally shown a dip from the peak level but still accounts for the bulk of domestic output, ASTO president Sanjay Goel wrote to Modi on November 23.

Oil Ministry has identified 15 producing oil and gas fields of ONGC and Oil India Ltd for handing over to private firms on the premise of raising output.

The fields have in-place reserve of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil, and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas have been identified.

Production trajectory at Panna-Mukta field, which was taken away from ONGC and privatised, has been on continuous decline, Goel wrote. ""In fact, from 2009-10, production from the asset has dropped by close to 60 per cent,"" he wrote.

Also, Ratna-R Series fields which were given to Essar Oil could not be brought to production in two decades and have now been reverted to ONGC.

""This clearly shows privatisation alone is not a sufficient condition for augmenting output from any hydrocarbon property,"" he wrote.

He said if stagnant or flagging production is a criterion for identifying underperforming fields of ONGC, the same yardstick must be extended to all domestic fields.

""The production today at RIL operated KG-D6 is under 10 per cent of its targeted production. For a field that is less than 10 years into its lifecycle, this is a staggering drop on any count,"" he said.

The production drop at KG-D6 to 5-6 million standard cubic meters per day has also had a collateral damage to stranded gas-based plants and other struggling industries.

""Compare that with the consistent gas supplies from our Bassein and Satellite Assets in western offshore - where production has averaged 30 mmscmd for the past 20 years at a stretch,"" he wrote.

Even when prices have tipped, Goel said it is a misnomer that ONGC got everything on a platter by getting the blocks on the nomination. ""ONGC, along with Oil India, was allotted those blocks at a time when there was hardly any private participation"" and it invested heavily to discover the fields and produce from them.

""No private player ever has undertaken ventures of this kind since they are generally guided by a motive of profit in business,"" he wrote.

He sought Modi's ""personal intervention to stall the move to hand over existing legacy fields of ONGC to private players which will not only have a highly damaging implication for the nation but also adversely affect the motivation of employees who are committed to serving the national interests.""

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is investing heavily in new technology and processes to improve recovery from the ageing fields, he said.

The company, he said, has never shied away from capital investment. Its capital outlay was not cut even when explorers worldwide froze fresh investment in view of the drop in prices.

""While all the private companies are geared towards maximising profit especially in a difficult market of low crude prices, ONGC is determined by maximising the recovery from its fields,"" he wrote.",600,-0.9910097320874532

Merger and acquisition deals involving public sector oil and gas companies have been exempted from seeking the Competition Commission approval, says a notification.

The corporate affairs ministry's decision to exempt such deals from the ambit of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) comes against the backdrop of the proposed consolidation and stake purchases among state-owned oil and gas companies.

In July, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved sale of the government's 51.11 percent stake in oil refiner HPCL to the country's largest oil producer ONGC. The ministry has said all cases of combinations involving the central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) operating in oil and gas sectors under the Petroleum Act, 1934, have been exempted from the CCI approval requirement for five years.

The exemption will also be applicable to their ""wholly- or partly-owned subsidiaries operating in the oil and gas sectors, from the application of the provisions of sections 5 and 6 of the (Competition) Act, for a period of five years"", the notification issued on November 22 said. Sections 5 and 6 pertain to combinations.

Under the norms, combinations or deals beyond a certain threshold compulsorily require approval from the CCI. Earlier this year, the ministry exempted mergers of nationalised banks from seeking CCI's approval.

About the latest notification, law firm Chandhiok & Associates said the exemption comes right before the government's implementation of policy to merge major oil public sector undertakings.

""The policy of immunising state owned enterprises from competition law has often been criticised as one which leads to inherent market distortions and inefficiencies.

""This policy is also likely to hinder harmonisation of Indian competition law with set international practices recommending competitive neutrality between private and public sector,"" it said in a note.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp, today said it has acquired 15 per cent stake in a oil block in Namibia.

It did not disclose the deal amount.

The 15 per cent participating interest in Namibia Petroleum Exploration License (PEL) 30, covering Block 2012A from Tullow Oil of UK, is OVL's second acquisition in the African nation in as many months.

In a statement, OVL said its indirect subsidiary ONGC Videsh Vankorneft Pte Ltd (OVVL)) has signed binding agreements with Tullow Namibia Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tullow Oil plc, for the stake buy.

Tullow held 25 per cent in the block.

Eco Oil and Gas Namibia (Pty) Ltd with 32.5 per cent stake, Azimuth Namibia Ltd (32.5 per cent) and National Petroleum Corp of Namibia (Pty) Ltd (10 per cent) are other partners in the License.

""The License is currently under First Renewal Exploration Period and the joint venture partners are carrying out data evaluation for identifying a drill prospect,"" the statement said.

Last month, OVL had acquired 30 per cent in PEL-37, covering three offshore blocks, from Tullow.

Tullow Oil held 65 per cent interest in PEL-37 while Pancontinental Namibia (Pty) Ltd held 30 per cent and the remaining 5 per cent is with Paragon Oil and Gas.

OVL said Eco is the operator of PEL-30 and Tullow shall acquire another 15 per cent participating interest from Eco to assume operatorship.

The acquisition, it said, is subject to regulatory and joint venture partners approval as well as grant of a 12 month extension to the First Renewal Exploration Period by the Namibian regulatory authority.

OVL said the fresh acquisition would strengthen its partnership with Tullow and its other partners and would mark consolidation of interest in Namibian offshore.

""The acquisition is consistent with OVL's strategic objective of adding high quality exploration and production assets to its existing exploration and production portfolio,"" the statement added.",367,0.9890949130058289

State-owned ONGC and Vedanta Ltd today emerged as the biggest bidders for oil and gas blocks, putting in 41 out of 56 bids received in India's maiden auction under open acreage licensing regime.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) put in expression of interest for 41 areas while Vedanta's oil unit, Cairn India sought rights over 15 areas, sources privy to the development said.

Hindustan Oil Exploration Co (HOEC) bid for one area in a round that was shunned by biggies like Reliance Industries.

India in July opened 2.8 million sq km of sedimentary basins for oil and gas exploration in a bid to raise domestic production and cut excessive dependence on imports.

The Open Acreage Licensing (OAL) allows companies to select blocks or areas after studying seismic data to explore and produce oil and gas. The first round of bidding closes today.

In all, 56 expressions of interest or EoIs have been received so far, source said. Oil India Ltd (OIL) is the other main bidder while the rest are smaller companies.

BP plc team visited data room but has not put in any bids so far, they said.

OAL replaces the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. OAL allows investors to carve out their own areas and put in an EoI. Once an EoI is received for an area, it is put on competitive bidding and any company offering the government maximum share of oil and gas is awarded the block.

The last date for submission of EoI in the first cycle of bidding under OAL is today and winners would be announced by January 1.

OAL is being offered under the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) that provides revenue sharing model for bidding for oil and gas blocks. It promises marketing and pricing freedom for oil and gas produced.

Under OAL, companies can carve out any area that is currently not under any licensee, and evince interest for doing exploration and production.

Once an area is selected, the government will put it up for bidding and any firm offering the maximum share of oil or gas produced from the area would be awarded the block.

Till now, the government has been selecting and demarcating areas it feels can be offered for bidding in an exploration licensing round.

So far 256 blocks had been offered for exploration and production since 2000. The last bid round happened in 2010. Of these, 254 blocks were awarded. But as many as 156 have already been relinquished due to poor prospectivity.",435,-0.9999890327453613

Venezuelan state oil-firm PDVSA has not made debt payments to India's top oil producer ONGC for six months, and has previously used a Russian state-owned bank and another Indian energy company as intermediaries to make payments, two sources familiar with the transactions said on Wednesday.

ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of ONGC, confirmed that PDVSA had fallen behind on the payments, but declined to give details on the delays.

""They have got certain challenges at this stage,"" ONGC Videsh said in an emailed response to Reuters' questions. ""They have assured that they are working on it (payment of dues). In due course it will be settled and follow up steps will be undertaken.""

""We have a good working relationship with PDVSA,"" ONGC said.

PDVSA declined to comment.

But the two sources, who requested anonymity, said PDVSA has made no payment since April on what was a $540 million backlog of dividends owed to ONGC for an investment the Indian firm made in a an energy project in Venezuela.

Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro said last week that the country planned to restructure some $60 billion of bonds, much of it held by PDVSA, as the country struggles to meet debt repayments.

The OPEC member's economy has collapsed since global oil prices plummeted in 2014. Venezuela depends on oil for more than 90 percent of export revenue.

PDVSA has delayed a range of payments, such as for oil services and supplies, as Caracas uses the scant dollar supplies available to make sovereign debt repayments.

LATE PAYMENTS, SANCTIONS

International banks and suppliers have reduced or halted credit to PDVSA since cash flow problems led the firm to start delaying payments to creditors in 2014. U.S. sanctions against Venezuelan officials including PDVSA executives, have also deterred banks from offering credit.

Maduro's government has increasingly turned to ally Russia for the cash and credit it needs to survive, according to a Reuters special report published in August.

Russia's state-run Gazprombank in January cleared a payment of $19.75 million of Venezuela's pending dues to ONGC, the two sources said. Details of the payment and Gazprombank's involvement have not previously been published.

India's Reliance Industries Ltd, owner of the world's biggest refining complex and one of PDVSA's biggest oil buyers, paid $68.66 million to ONGC on behalf of PDVSA in April, the sources said.

Gazprombank and Reliance did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

PDVSA and ONGC Videsh Ltd last year signed a deal for PDVSA to pay the debt by assigning the Indian firm 17,000 barrels per day of oil. Under the agreement, PDVSA sells the oil on behalf of ONGC and sends the cash to the Indian company.

ONGC cannot take delivery of the oil because its Mangalore refinery is unable to process Venezuela's heavy crude.

Venezuela has often used oil to repay debt: it owes billions of dollars to both Russia and China and is paying both with oil.

Many multinational firms have written off their Venezuelan operations and investments, but ONGC is aiming to expand in the South American country.

The Indian firm is seeking to raise funding for Venezuela's San Cristobal oil project, in which the Indian company has a 40 percent stake. PDVSA and ONGC aim to raise oil output from the project to about 27,000 bpd from 18,000 bpd.",594,-0.3045440415541331

Motilal Oswal's research report on ONGC

PAT grew 3% YoY (32% QoQ) to INR 51.3b, beating our estimate of INR 43.5b. The outperformance at PAT level was led by higher other income at INR 19.3b (our estimate: INR 8b; up 49% YoY and 126% QoQ). Other income was higher on account of higher dividend payments from subsidiaries – INR 2.3b from OVL and INR 7.5b from MRPL.

Outlook

For FY18E/19E/20E, with Brent at USD55/60/60/bbl and INR/USD at 64.6/66/67, we expect EPS of INR 19/22.8/22.5. The stock trades at 8.3x FY19E EPS, and EV of 3.6x FY19E EBITDA. Using SOTP, we value the stock at INR 231/share (September 2018 TP), implying 22% upside. Maintain Buy.

Axis Direct's research report on ONGC

Production growth of 5%/9% in FY18/19 led by gas volume growth of 9%/17%. With H1FY18 volume growth already at 5%, ONGC is confident of achieving its FY18 volume guidance ♦ Opex will decline by 10-15% due to ~30% decline in dayrates of rigs/ OSVs though partially offset by higher manpower costs ♦ Volume contribution from deep-water fields (esp. Vashishta) will increase to ~7% (~1% currently) from Q4FY18, which will fetch gas price of USD 6+/mnbtu (vs. USD 2.9/mnbtu for nomination fields)

Outlook

We increase our FY18E/19E EPS by 5% and TP to Rs 215 (Rs 200 earlier) to factor in higher production and lower opex. Rising volumes (albeit lower than management guidance), declining opex and firm crude prices augur well for ONGC.

A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar refused to entertain the PIL which also sought cancellation of the appointment of Shashi Shanker as ONGC Chairman and Managing Director (CMD).

The NGO, Energy Watchdog, had earlier questioned the eligibility of Patra to be appointed as an independent director and alleged that proper procedure was not followed for appointing him.

Senior advocate Jayant Bhushan, appearing for the NGO, had also said that the BJP spokesperson was a doctor and ONGC has nothing to do in the field of medicine to appoint him on its Board.

The Centre had defended the appointment, saying Patra was successfully running an NGO for the downtrodden which shows his management skills and hence was eligible for the post.

The NGO's lawyer had also argued that appointing Patra to the post for a remuneration of around Rs 23 lakh per year amounted to grant of state largesse to a private person.

Shanker's appointment as ONGC CMD was opposed on the ground that he was suspended in February 2015 for six months in connection with a probe into the award of a contract by the PSU.

Nearly 25 years after ONGC's prime discovered oilfields were privatised, the oil ministry has identified 11 more producing oil and gas fields of the state-run firm for handing over to private firms to raise output.

The ministry is approaching the Cabinet to allow private companies take 60 percent stake in producing oil and gas fields of national oil companies, ONGC and OIL, with the view that they would raise production above the baseline estimate.

As many as 15 fields - 11 of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and four of Oil India Ltd (OIL) - with cumulative in place reserve of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas have been identified, sources privy to the development said.

These include Kalok, Ankleshwar, Gandhar and Santhal - the big four oilfields of ONGC in Gujarat.

All of these fields are in blocks or areas that were given to the national oil companies on nomination basis and the current policy does not allow private firms taking equity stake in a nomination block.

So, a change in policy is required for which the ministry is approaching the cabinet, the sources said.

The policy currently allows giving out of participating interest (PI) or a stake to a private company only in the blocks or areas awarded in open auctions under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) since 1999.

However, only exploration acreage was auctioned under global bidding in such rounds. All areas prior to that were given to ONGC and OIL on a nomination basis.

A baseline based on current oil and gas production from the 15 identified fields would be set and private companies taking 60 percent equity stake would get only the incremental volumes, sources said.

The fields would be auctioned and any firm committing the maximum capital investment within 10 years of the contract award and the largest share out of its net revenue to the government would be awarded the field.

The 15 fields selected are out of review of 202 fields operated by the national oil companies. The fields chosen are ones that hold reserves of 20 or more million tonnes of oil equivalent (MT OE) and have crossed the half-way mark on a score (indicative of poor field performance) combining exploration index, current recovery and production decline rate in the last three years.

Of the 202 fields, 141 are either less than 10 years of age or had shown some positive change in the year-on-year production rate.

As many as 44 fields of ONGC and OIL have been identified for production enhancement work through Technical Services Model where technical tie-ups would get the 'tariff' that they bid as a return for increasing the output 'over the baseline production' for 10 years initially.

Sources said the ministry is unhappy with the near stagnant oil and gas production and believes giving out the discovered fields to private firms would help raise output as they can bring in technology and capital.

It has been tasked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cut oil import dependence by 10 percent by 2022 over 77 percent dependence in 2014-15. The dependence has only increased and is now over 80 percent.

The privatisation is repeat of the infamous round in 1992-93 when medium sized discovered fields like Panna/Mukta and Tapti oil and gas field in the western offshore was given to now defunct Enron Corp of the US and Reliance Industries. As many as 28 fields were then awarded.

Under this regime, ONGC was made licensee and given an option to farm-in 40 percent of stake.

The controversial privatisation under the then oil minister Satish Sharma had resulted in a CBI inquiry.

India's ONGC Videsh has turned its focus to buying stakes in overseas oil and gas assets to meet output targets after a delay by Iran in awarding development rights for a gas field, its managing director said on Thursday.

Indian firms led by ONGC Videsh, the foreign investment arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp, have been negotiating with Iran for development rights of Farzad B gas field since its discovery in 2008.

""We have been extremely flexible in our dealing with Iran and hoped that Farzad will add to our output target but the deal is not yet finalised. In the meantime, we are looking for producing assets elsewhere to boost our output,"" N.K. Verma told Reuters.

ONGC Videsh is targeting production of 60 million tonnes of oil and gas by 2030 from 12.80 million tonnes in 2016/17. Verma listed Africa, Central Asia and Latin America as preferred regions for acquiring producing assets.

India was hoping to get rights to develop Farzad B as the South Asian nation was one of the handful countries that continued to deal with Tehran despite sanctions.

But since the end of some sanctions last year, Iran has sought other investors and media reports suggest that Tehran has agreed to award the field to Russia's Gazprom.

Verma said India modified its bid several times to match Tehran's expectations and terms to get the development rights.

""We wanted to do only upstream but Iran asked us to include downstream so we revised and raised our bid to $11 billion and linked gas prices to international benchmarks,"" he said. ONGC had previously submitted a $5 billion deal.

Iran has modified its petroleum contract model, ending a decades old buy-back system that barred foreign firms from booking reserves or taking equity stakes.

Under new terms Iran wants India to operate the field for 20 years and commit to buy gas for 25 years at prices higher than those proposed by ONGC, he said.

Iran's previous contracts gave investors an assured return of 18 percent.

""Our calculations show that under new rules we would be getting returns in low single digit and do not justify taking investment and production risk,"" Verma said.

The Farzad B field lies on the border of Iran and Saudi Arabia, which has already began gas production from its side of the project called Hisbah.

India, the world's third-biggest oil consumer, has told state oil firms to acquire assets overseas to improve energy security. India imports about 80 percent of its crude needs.

""We are still keen to develop the fields if Iran offers us good returns as our main aim is to book reserves for our country,"" Verma said.",489,0.9951876997947693

ONGC plans to nearly double natural gas production in four years as it invests billions of dollars to produce from newer discoveries, the state-owned firm's chairman Shashi Shanker said.

India's biggest oil and gas producer is investing Rs 92,000 crore in 35 major projects which include 14 to bring new finds to production and six to improve recovery from the ageing fields.

""We have almost 70 per cent of oil production coming from mature fields. My primary challenge is to step up production,"" said Shanker, who took over as the Chairman of Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) last month.

Plans on table would help raise crude oil production from 22.25 million tonnes in 2016-17 to 27 MT by 2021-22, he said.

Natural gas output is envisaged to rise from 22 billion cubic meters (60 million standard cubic meters per day) to 42 bcm (115 mmscmd) in FY'22, he said.

ONGC's roadmap to raise output comes two years after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set the target for reducing oil import dependence by 10 per cent, from 77 per cent in 2013-14.

India spend almost USD 1 trillion on crude imports from financial year 2005-06 to 2015-16.

The company's oil production will rise to 23 MT in the current fiscal and to 23.6 MT in 2018-19, 24.3 MT in 2019-20, 26.4 MT in 2020-21 and 27 MT in 2021-22.

Shanker said ONGC is investing over USD 5 billion in developing oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin block KG-DWN-98/2, which sits next to Reliance Industries' flagging KG-D6 fields.

Production is expected to start in 2020 with peak oil output seen at 78,069 barrels per day and 16.6 mmscmd of gas.

""The challenges facing ONGC, as I see, include finding out ways to increase domestic production, delivering projects under implementation on time and attrition,"" he said.

Also, natural gas pricing is a challenge as current rate of USD 2.89 per million British thermal unit is way below USD 4.5 needed to cover for cost and provide reasonable return, he said.

""We have made representations to the government (on the issue). We are optimistic something will happen on this front,"" he said.

As on October 1, 2016, ONGC had 577 hydrocarbon discoveries. Most of them were either in production or action had been initiated to monetise them.

The roadmap for increasing output addresses monetisation plan of all the discoveries of ONGC, barring about 42 finds which are isolated/far from existing infrastructure, or have very low volumes or are located in difficult areas.

ONGC's output from the currently producing fields is projected to fall from 18.5 MT in the current fiscal to 12.66 MT in 2021-22. This is to be supplemented by about 5.3 MT expected from fields where investment approval has already been given and another 8.45 MT from the fields that are under conceptualisation or investment approval is under process.

For natural gas, the output is projected to drop from 19.73 billion cubic meters from current fields to 11.9 bcm in 2021-22. The situation is rescued by fields that are under development or conceptualisation that will give 29.65 bcm in 2021-22.",564,0.06991684436798096

After several weeks of delay, the government has sent ONGC an information memorandum (IM) based on which the state-owned firm would make an offer to buy majority stake in HPCL, officials said.

The Cabinet had on July 19 approved the sale of government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) as part of its Rs 72,500 crore disinvestment target for the current fiscal, 2017-18.

Transaction advisors were appointed in August and it was expected that an IM containing detailed information on HPCL's assets and liabilities would be handed over to ONGC by mid- September so as to help it firm up a value for the stake buy.

""In a typical strategic stake sale, the government opens data room for potential acquirer to access information on the target company. But in case of HPCL this is being done on the basis of largely publicly known information that has been put in IM,"" an official who wished not to be identified said.

Originally, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) was keen to close the transaction in October or November itself but it managed to send the IM to ONGC only on October 31.

Separately, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker said the company is hoping to close the deal by March 31.

""We received IM on Tuesday and we would do independent valuation of HPCL,"" he told reporters last evening.

JM Financial is DIPAM's the transaction advisor for the stake sale which at current prices may fetch the government about Rs 35,000 crore.

Besides, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas has been appointed as the legal advisor for handling the stake sale.

With ONGC and HPCL under the administrative control of the oil ministry, the latter has appointed 'Protocol Valuers Ltd' for suggesting valuation at which the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL should be sold to ONGC.

""We have appointed CitiGroup and SBI Caps as our transaction advisor and would be appointing valuation experts as well,"" Shanker said.

On the funding, he said all options are open for ONGC.

""We have not yet decided. We have internal accruals and have secured shareholder approval for borrowing Rs 25,000 crore. Also we hold substantial stake in Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and GAIL, a part of which could be liquidated. So the funding could be one or a combination of these,"" he said.

ONGC holds 13.77 per cent stake in IOC, India's biggest refiner, which at current trading price is worth over Rs 27,800 crore.

It also holds 4.87 per cent stake in gas utility GAIL, which is worth about Rs 3,900 crore at current prices.

Officials said the merchant banker appointed by DIPAM will assist the government on ""modalities of disinvestment and the timing"" as well as recommend the need for intermediaries required for the process.

It will do business valuation of HPCL, structure the transaction, suggest measures to fetch optimum value and assess positioning of the strategic sale.

Besides, it will prepare all documents like information memorandum (IM), confidentiality and transaction agreements such as pact to sale and the share purchase agreement.

The legal advisor will review and advise on all legal contracts, titles of properties, assets, real estate, intellectual property rights and contracts with employees.

It will also draft transaction related documents and advise on the structure of the transaction, including compliance with Sebi guidelines and stock exchange listing norms.",582,

Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) is likely to acquire Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) in a share-swap deal to become India's second-largest oil refiner.

The merger is likely to take place after ONGC, country's biggest oil and gas explorer, completes acquisition of HPCL in an all-cash deal by December or January, officials in know of the development said.

MRPL is a subsidiary of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC). At present, ONGC owns 71.63 per cent stake in MRPL while HPCL has 16.96 per cent.

Once ONGC acquires 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL, India's third-largest refiner, for about Rs 35,000 crore, it will have two refinery subsidiaries - HPCL and MRPL.

""It does not make economic sense to have two separate subsidiaries for the same business. And so the logical move would be to integrate MRPL with HPCL,"" an official said.

The government is selling its entire 51.11 per cent holding in HPCL to ONGC for all-cash. HPCL will become a subsidiary of ONGC after the deal and retain independent board.

""HPCL can acquire MRPL either by buying out ONGC's shares, which at today's trading price is worth close to Rs 16,800 crore. The other option is share-swap, wherein ONGC will get more shares in HPCL in lieu of it giving up its control in MRPL,"" the official said.

Share-swap, he said, is most likely option for the merger.

""An exercise to arrive at valuations etc will begin shortly,"" he said.

Another official said it makes business sense for ONGC to bring all its refinery business under one umbrella.

He said the board of ONGC and HPCL are yet to consider the proposal.

HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio. This together with 15 million tonnes refinery of MRPL will create India's second-biggest state-owned oil refiner after Indian Oil Corp (IOC).

MRPL will be the third refinery of HPCL, which already has units at Mumbai and Visakhapatnam.

The government's selling its 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC will achieve the disinvestment target for the current fiscal.

The transaction will allow the government to monetise its HPCL ownership without losing ultimate control of the company.",374,0.9587830007076263

KRChoksey's research report on ONGC

ONGC reported net profit of INR. 51,308 mn up 32.1% QoQ and 3.1% YoY. Net profits look up on a QoQ basis due to higher crude oil prices, lower operating expenditure and higher other income. Exploration cost write off stood at INR 13,331 mn up 26.1% QoQ and 143.5% YoY due to high dry well write offs. ONGC’s net crude price realization increased 0.4% QoQ and 6.9% YoY to $51.22/barrel; Raw material consumption was INR 2,656mn up 18.1% QoQ and down 14.4% YoY. Statutory levies were INR 45,002 mn up 0.2% QoQ and 1.7% YoY. Other operating expense was down by 13.2% QoQ and 7.0% YoY to INR 38,352 mn due to lower rig rates for exploration. Other Income came in at 19,315 mn, up 126.1% QoQ and 63.2% YoY. EBITDA stood at INR 91,361 mn up 3.5% QoQ and 0.4% YoY.

Outlook

We believe that stable crude oil prices combined with relatively lower operating expenditure will help to improve the profitability of the company. Increasing production under OVL from the new opportunities combined with improving net realizations will positively improve the revenues. At a CMP of INR 184, the stock is trading at 12.96x of its FY19E earnings and at 8.7x of its FY20E earnings. We recommend a BUY rating with a target price of INR 250 (upside – 35.9%).For all recommendations report, click here

ONGC's planned acquisition of a majority stake in refiner HPCL will create India's first integrated oil and gas company but will cause the state-owned firm's leverage to approach the upper limit of its rating, Moody's Investors Service said today.

The government's selling its 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will help it achieve the disinvestment target for the current fiscal.

""The transaction also allows the government to monetise its HPCL ownership without losing ultimate control of the company,"" Moody's said.

Based on HPCL's average market capitalisation over last three months, the government's stake is worth about Rs 35,000 crore, which ONGC may fund through borrowings of Rs 25,000 crore and the rest with cash on hand and the liquidation of investments.

Moody's said that post acquisition, it will assess ONGC's credit profile after full consolidation of HPCL.

""Post acquisition, ONGC's local currency rating will be a maximum of one notch higher than the sovereign's local currency rating. This will be driven by an increase in ONGC's exposure to domestic revenues through the refining and marketing business of HPCL,"" it said in a note.

Also, the increase in ONGC's leverage from the acquisition will be seen as an indication of stronger government influence on the company's financial profile, it said, adding that the rating on foreign currency bonds will remain constrained by the Baa2 country ceiling for foreign currency bonds in India.

HPCL, it said, will remain strategically important to the government given its large-scale refining and marketing operations.

It will continue to be a state-owned entity and the government retains its ability to appoint all board directors.

The acquisition will create India's first integrated oil and gas company but benefits will be limited, Moody's said.

""Although the contribution of the downstream segment will increase and will result in lower volatility in earnings, the upstream segment will still account for 70 per cent of EBITDA.

""There will be some synergies but the benefits will be limited to the downstream segment, where there is an overlap between ONGC and HPCL's operations,"" it said.

ONGC's refinery and petrochemical operations will be able to use HPCL's established marketing infrastructure, which will result in lower costs in those business segments.

Stating that ONGC's financial metrics will deteriorate post acquisition, Moody's said the state-owned firm's pro- forma leverage, as measured by retained cash flow (RCF)/net debt, would weaken to 33 per cent from 68 per cent and debt/ EBITDA will increase to 1.9x from 1.1x.

This leverage increase will be partly offset by a qualitative improvement in ONGC's business position as a vertically integrated company. ""The pro-forma financial metrics of ONGC could still support its Baa1 rating,"" it said.",464,0.6911595038005284

BJP's national spokesperson Sambit Patra's appointment as an independent director on the board of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Limited was today challenged in the Delhi High Court by an NGO.

The NGO, in its plea, also sought cancellation of the appointment of Shashi Shanker as ONGC Chairman and Managing Director.

The public interest litigation (PIL) filed by NGO Energy Watchdog could not be taken up for hearing as the bench headed by Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal did not assemble today.

The matter has been fixed for hearing on November 1.

The PIL was filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan, who alleged that Patra, being an active member of the ruling BJP, ""cannot play the role of an Independent Director or non- official director (NOD) in ONGC as it would be a violation of the Companies Act.""

The plea claimed that the selection process was also ""flawed"" as the BJP leader's name did not appear in the data bank of eligible persons for the post.

""State largesse cannot be passed on to a private political person in this manner,"" it claimed.

Efforts to reach Patra for his comments on the issue did not fructify.

Opposing Shanker's appointment, the NGO has contended that he was suspended in February 2015 by the vigilance department of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas for alleged ""gross misconduct"" in connection with a tender matter while he was Director (Technology and Field Services) in ONGC.

However, his suspension was revoked in July 2015 citing the Supreme Court's general observation that a suspended officer should be reinstated if an agency fails to file a chargesheet within 90 days, the plea said.

The petition has sought setting aside of the September 25 and September 29 orders appointing Shanker and Patra respectively to the ONGC board.

The NGO has sought directions to the Centre and the Central Vigilance Department to produce the records they have in connection with the suspension of Shanker.

It has also sought the grades awarded to Shanker and Patra by the Public Enterprises Selection Board which had interviewed them for the posts.",359,-0.8627975583076477

The government is likely to achieve its fiscal deficit target of 3.2 per cent this financial year as the budgeted disinvestment receipts are on track to realise Rs 72,500 crore, says an SBI research report.

According to the report, though there are predictions that the government is going to have a big revenue slippage in 2017-18 which may impact fiscal deficit numbers, ""such projections flunk the test of logical reasoning and are grossly misconstrued"".

""Fiscal deficit target of 3.2 per cent in FY18 seems not difficult, as revenue may be lower than budgeted, but more than offset by disinvestment and expenditure cuts,"" said the SBI research report, Ecowrap.

The report noted that the government will able to meet the disinvestment target of Rs 72,500 crore as Rs 60,000 crore has already been achieved and hence the fear of low disinvestment receipts is ""completely unwarranted"".

""After 2009-10, this may for the first time government would able to meet the disinvestment target, as budgeted,"" it noted. In the current year so far, the government has already raised about Rs 19,759 crore through minority stake sale in CPSEs and strategic disinvestment.

Further, the takeover of HPCL by ONGC will garner about Rs 30,000 crore and the disinvestment in GIC raised Rs 10,662 crore for the government. Interestingly, the government also plans to sell its entire stake in Hospital Service Consultancy Corporation (HSCC), Engineering Projects (India) Ltd (EPI) and National Projects Construction Corporation (NPCC) to a similarly-placed CPSE.

The report however noted that to manage the fiscal deficit, the government needs to cut expenditure substantially. ""We estimate that government may cut around Rs 70,000 crore from capital expenditure and Rs 38,000 crore from revenue expenditure compared to budget estimate of FY18.

""We are ready to invest provided we get reasonable returns,"" OVL Managing Director Narendra K Verma told reporters here.

OVL has offered to invest about USD 5.8 billion in developing the Farzad-B gas field and another USD 5 billion to build a liquefied natural gas export facility, he said.

Iran wants a high price of the natural gas, making the investment practically unviable.

""We will get the project the day we accept their conditions. But for me to go ahead and make such investments, it has to bring reasonable returns and making economic sense,"" he said without elaborating.

Iran had earlier this year signed initial pact with Russia's Gazprom for developing the OVL-discovered gas field of Farzad B but has kept the door open for awarding it to the Indian firm.

""We have given them our best offer. Now, it is up to them to agree or not agree,"" Verma said.

With Tehran delaying the award of rights to develop the 12.5 trillion cubic feet gas field to its discoverer — ONGC Videsh Ltd — India decided to cut oil imports from Iran by a fifth in 2017-18.

Iran retaliated by first cutting by one-third the time it gave to Indian refiners to pay for oil they buy from it as also raising ship freight rates, and then by signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Russian gas monopoly Gazprom.

Farzad B was discovered by OVL in the Farsi block about 10 years ago. The project has so far cost the OVL-led consortium, which also includes Oil India Ltd and Indian Oil Corp (IOC), over USD 80 million.

The field in the Farsi block has an in-place gas reserve of 21.7 tcf, of which 12.5 tcf are recoverable. New Delhi is keen that the gas from the field comes to India to feed the vast energy needs.

Sources said Indian refiners have cut oil imports from Iran by a fifth to 190,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017-18 from 240,000 bpd in the previous fiscal.

Iran, India's third biggest oil supplier, used to give a 90-day credit period to refiners like Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) to pay for the oil they would buy from it.

Now, Tehran has reduced this to 60 days, essentially meaning that IOC and MRPL would have to pay for the oil they buy from Iran in 60 days instead of previous liberal term of 90 days, sources said.

Iran oil sale terms were the most attractive for Indian refiners. Besides, a liberal credit period, it also shipped the oil to India for a nominal 20 per cent of normal ocean freight.

Other Middle-East sellers offer not more than 15-day credit period.

Sources said National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) has also decided to cut the discount it offers to Indian buyers on freight from 80 per cent to about 60 per cent.",519,-0.18073795239130655

State-owned ONGC is likely to sell some of its stake in IOC to institutional investors like LIC to part-fund its over Rs 34,000-crore acquisition of refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL).

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) holds 13.77 per cent stake in India's biggest refiner Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), which at today's market price is worth over Rs 27,800 crore. It has another 4.87 per cent stake in GAIL India Ltd worth of Rs 1,600 crore.

""The acquisition of 51.11 per cent government stake in HPCL will be funded through a combination of market borrowing and selling some stake in IOC and GAIL,"" a source privy to the development said.

Selling stake in the open market may create volatility and so, ONGC is considering selling less than 2 per cent stake in IOC to institutional investors like LIC in block deal, he added.

ONGC has already secured shareholder nod to raise up to Rs 25,000 crore debt, he said, adding that the company had about Rs 10,000 crore of cash in hand.

""It will be a combination of stake sale and borrowing to fund the acquisition,"" the source said.

The deal, he said, is likely to conclude by December. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on July 19 granted 'in-principle' approval to the strategic sale of the government's existing 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC ""along with the transfer of management control, which will result in HPCL becoming a subsidiary company of ONGC"".

But since the offer meant a transfer of management control from the government to ONGC, there was apprehension that it would trigger Sebi's takeover code and compel ONGC to make an open offer to acquire an additional 26 per cent stake from minority shareholders, he said.

So, the terms of sale have been amended to state that ""HPCL will continue to be a government company in terms of section 2(45) of the Companies Act, 2013, and will continue to be controlled by the Government of India through ONGC under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas"".

This helped avoid making an open offer.",365,0.9995573163032532

State-run ONGC has received the coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearance for setting up a seawater desalination plant at its Uran unit in Raigad, Maharashtra at a cost of Rs 266.40 crore, according to an official letter issued to the company.

The proposal is to set up a seawater desalination plant with a capacity to process 20 million litres per day (MLD). The proposed site is about 380 meters away from the high tide line (HTL) of Arabian Sea, along the western coast of India.

Desalination is a process to remove dissolved minerals from feed water sources such as seawater and brackish water. Desalination of seawater is being increasingly adopted worldwide to cope with the deficit in availability of potable water.

In the letter, the environment ministry said it has given the CRZ clearance for establishing a desalination plant in Maharashtra after taking into account the recommendation of its expert panel.

The approval is subject to compliance of certain conditions such as obtaining of 'no objection certificate' from Maharashtra Pollution Control Board for discharge of brine water into the sea after necessary safeguards, it said.

The proposed desalination plant will be set up within the gas processing facility of ONGC Uran. About 8,750 square meter area has been earmarked for this purpose. The cost of the project is estimated at Rs 266.40 crore.

According to ONGC, the proposed project will cater process water and drinking water to the tune of 18 MLD and 2 MLD, respectively. It will help the company reduce its dependence on the State Water Supply Board.

Exploration giant ONGC contributes 72 percent to the country's total crude oil production and 48 percent of natural gas. It owns and operates 11,000 km of pipelines in the country and produces more than 1.27 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.",339,0.862718403339386

The ministry had, in a departure from past norms and guidelines, earlier this month recommended to the ACC that Shanker be appointed for an initial one-year term instead of the usual five-year period.

During this one-year term, his performance was proposed to be reviewed every quarter instead of the current practice of review after one year, sources in the know of the development said.

ACC, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, appointed Shanker as Chairman and Managing Director of ONGC ""till the date of his superannuation or until further orders, whichever is earlier"", an official order issued on September 25 said.

India plans to offer stakes of up to 60 percent in oil and gas fields owned by state energy companies that are already under production to private firms, said five government and company sources with knowledge of the matter.

The government is making the decision after failing to draw investment from global oil majors in new fields. The plan would boost India's domestic oil and gas output and would meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target to reduce oil imports by 10 percent by 2022. However, the plan could reduce profits of state-owned companies.

India is the world's third-largest crude importer, buying 80 percent of its supplies from overseas.

The sales plan would affect so-called ""nomination blocks"" or fields handed to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd. The fields are located both onshore and offshore, according to the sources.

The Directorate General of Hydrocarbon (DGH), a unit of the oil ministry, has suggested these state companies form joint ventures with private firms including foreign majors that have long eyed these fields, the sources said.

India's cabinet could accept the new policy by December, said one of the sources, a government official.

The DGH has also proposed the state-owned companies enact technical tie-ups with private firms, offering to give them an assured rate of return if the output increases beyond a certain level, the five sources said.

The shift in strategy is triggered by the inability of domestic explorers to keep pace with India's rising energy demand.

After the discovery of the Bombay High oil fields in 1974 and Bassein gas fields in 1976, ONGC has not been able to bring any new major fields into production in the last three decades.

India has failed to draw interest from global oil majors in licensing rounds since 1990 even though the fiscal terms were eased. However, Royal Dutch Shell and BP later bought stakes from firms that had won drilling rights.

Another of the sources, an ONGC executive, said the government's move to invite private firms in the mature oil fields will impact their long-term plans.

""We look at the blocks from a long-term basis...internally, the company is not keen on the move as it can disrupt the current planning and production targets over the long term,"" the executive said, speaking on the condition of anonymity since he was not authorised to speak to journalists.

A third source, also with ONGC, said the company would prefer to share revenue with the new partners for the incremental production but not for the entire output from the fields.

A spokesman for ONGC declined to comment. The DGH Director General Atanu Chakraborty also declined to make a comment.",457,-0.4391265958547592

Shashi Shanker has been appointed Chairman and Managing Director of India's biggest oil and gas producer, ONGC, till March 2021.

The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) named Shanker, who is currently Director (Technical and Field Services) at ONGC, as CMD till his superannuation, as against an initial one-year term proposed by the Oil Ministry.

The ministry had, in a departure from past norms and guidelines, earlier this month recommended to the ACC that Shanker be appointed for an initial one-year term instead of the usual five-year period, sources in the know of the development said.

During this one-year term, his performance was proposed to be reviewed every quarter instead of the current practice of review after one year, they said.

ACC, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, appointed Shanker as Chairman and Managing Director of ONGC ""till the date of his superannuation or until further orders, whichever is earlier"", an official order issued last evening said.

Shanker, 56, will take charge from October 1 when the incumbent Dinesh K Sarraf retires and will have a three-and- a-half-year term until March 31, 2021.

Reached for comments, a top oil ministry official, refusing to be identified, said, ""all that matters is what is the appointment terms. What we said or did not say are irrelevant"".

Sources said government headhunters Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB) had after interviewing nine candidates on June 19 recommended Shanker for the ONGC top job.

Anti-corruption watchdog CVC cleared his appointment last month. More than a month later, the ministry cited exploration challenges facing ONGC in raising crude oil and natural gas output in seeking a year's validity for Shanker's appointment.

During this one year initial period, his performance was proposed to be reviewed on a quarterly basis before seeking fresh ACC mandate for further employment, sources said.

ONGC's crude oil production was 22.56 million tons in 2012-13, which dipped to 22.25 million tons in the following year before rising marginally to 22.26 million tons in 2014-15 and 22.36 million tons in 2015-16. It dipped again to 22.25 million tons in 2016-17.

Sarraf, who took over as the Chairman of ONGC on March 1, 2014, has been shortlisted to head the downstream oil regulator, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB).

Established norms and PESB rules state that a board-level functionary would be considered for appointment for a period of five years or until the age of superannuation, whichever is earlier, with a provision that he/she would be assessed by the administrative ministry after the first year of his employment.

After yesterday's order, Shanker's performance would now be reviewed after one year and the ministry would seek confirmation for the balance tenure.

The Oil Ministry had in February 2015 suspended Shanker following allegations of irregularities in a tender for buying 21 Blowout Preventers (BOP).

The suspension, which was handed over without giving any showcase, was set aside after CVC found no wrongdoing on his part. He was reinstated in July that year with orders that said that the period of suspension be treated as his being on service.

No chargesheet was filed against him within the stipulated 90 days.

Shanker was the youngest director on the board of the nation's most profitable oil company when he was appointed Director (Technology and Field Services) on December 1, 2012. He was just 51 years old then.

ONGC board has seven full-time directors including the Chairman and Managing Director. While Sarraf retires on September 30, Director (Finance) A K Srinivasan would retire on October 31. Director (Offshore) T K Sengupta retires on December 31, followed by Director (Onshore) V P Mahawar in February 2018 and Director (HR) D D Misra in July next year.",626,-0.9899456898371378

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will acquire the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL through a bulk or block deal some time in November or December at the prevailing market price.

While the government is keen that the deal, which would fetch it over Rs 33,000 crore at the current market price, is done in October, ONGC wants time to raise the money required for the acquisition, a senior government official said.

The government's transaction advisor JM Financial and legal consultant Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas is preparing Information Memorandum (IM) on Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) with India's largest oil and gas producer, ONGC, in the next 7-10 days.

ONGC has appointed SBI Caps and the Citi Group as its merchant bankers for the deal and Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas as legal advisor, who would study the IM to arrive at a valuation for the takeover of the country's third-largest refining and oil marketing company.

The official said ONGC will do the due diligence of HPCL's assets based on the IM and publicly available information to arrive at the valuation. Negotiations between ONGC and the government will follow if the valuation is vastly different from the one the government has arrived at.

The share purchase would happen through a bulk or block deal at the prevailing market price, he said, adding that going by the pace of things, the deal could happen some time in November or December.

Both bulk and block deals are done on stock exchanges. A block deal happens when a transaction involves a minimum quantity of 5,00,000 shares or a minimum value of Rs 5 crore between two parties. Such deal takes place through a separate window at the beginning of trading hours for the duration of 35 minutes i.e. from 9.15 am to 9.50 am in a price range of +1% to -1% (plus or minus 1 per cent) of the ruling market price.

A bulk deal is a trade where total quantity of shares bought or sold is more than 0.5 per cent of the number of shares of a listed company. Bulk deals happen during the normal trading window provided by the broker.

The official said the government's 51.92 crore shares could be sold to ONGC using either the bulk or block deal.

This would also help avoid triggering an open offer.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on July 19 granted 'in-principle' approval to the strategic sale of the government's existing 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC ""along with the transfer of management control, which will result in HPCL becoming a subsidiary company of ONGC"".

But since the offer meant a transfer of management control from the government to ONGC, there was apprehension it would trigger Sebi's takeover code and compel ONGC to make an open offer to acquire an additional 26 per cent stake from minority shareholders, he said.

So, the terms of sale have been amended to state that ""HPCL will continue to be a government company in terms of section 2(45) of the Companies Act, 2013 and will continue to be controlled by the Government of India through ONGC under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas"".

Though the government is cashing out on its holding, the amended terms make it clear that it will continue to retain control of HPCL, the official said, adding that since there is no transfer of actual control, there will be no requirement of an open offer.

At today's trading price of Rs 428.75, ONGC would have to pay Rs 33,268 crore for buying the government's 51.11 per cent stake. Had it been required to make an open offer, it would have had to shell out additional Rs 17,100 crore to buy another 26 per cent from the open market.

Another official said ONGC will have to borrow about Rs 25,000 crore to fund just the purchase of the government stake.

Half of the company's Rs 15,000 crore of cash has already gone into buying Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation's stake in a KG basin gas block, and after accounting for capital expenditure requirement for the current year, ONGC will be left with Rs 4,000-5,000 crore.

The rest will have to be borrowed, he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday inaugurated Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC)'s new corporate office in Vasant Kunj, Delhi.

In February, the state-owned oil and natural gas firm had changed the name of its newly built office from Rajiv Gandhi Urja Bhawan to Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Urja Bhawan after the Bharatiya Jan Sangh politician and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue.

The inauguration took place on the birth centenary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya.

Then PM Manmohan Singh had named the building 'green-building' after former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi while laying the foundation stone in 2007.

Here are some of the features and accolades received by the swanky new office space:

The building has been built at a cost of around Rs 600 crore and was earlier supposed to house the corporate office of ONGC's overseas subsidiary ONGC Videsh.

The 'green structure' had in February this year, received LEED Platinum award from US Green Building Council — the highest recognition for sustainable building design.

It is registered as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Project under the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC), with Carbon Emission Reductions (CER) of 5,944 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per annum.

The office consumes almost half of the energy consumed by normal office spaces per square feet and uses 36 percent less water per capita than normal commercial buildings.

Low PE stocks underperformed high PE stocks by 8 percent till Jun- 17, but, since then, they have begun to do well again.

The global investment bank remains overweight on Energy, IT and Metals which have driven positive returns, whereas some staples (ITC) and Pharma stocks have continued to underperform.

Indian market rose by about 24 percent at some point in 2017 to hit fresh record high but then geopolitical concerns, profit booking as well as high valuations pulled benchmark indices lower.

PE ratio or price to earnings multiple is calculated by dividing the market price of the share with its EPS or earnings per share. The company with a low PE ratio looks attractive

High or a low PE is calculated by taking the median of P/E ratios over several years, analysts can arrive at a standardised P/E ratio. This could serve as a benchmark to indicate whether or not a stock is worth buying. A low P/E can indicate the market may be undervalued currently.

Top stocks which fall under the low positive P/E segment as per the global investment bank include names like RIL, ONGC, IOC, SBI, ICICI Bank, HPCL, BPCL, and TCS.

Top stocks which fall under the high positive P/E segment include companies like HDFC Bank, Maruti Suzuki, ITC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, L&T, Bajaj Finance, and Bharti Airtel.

“Low P/E stocks have forward P/E lower than the median of BSE500 stocks where forward earnings are available. While low P/E generally provides a downside cushion, earnings progression for the current set has also been better,” said the report.

The report further added that over the past 12 months, one-year forward earnings are up 9 percent for the low P/E set compared to 2 percent for high P/E stocks. Since Jan-16, the one-year forward EPS has risen 6 percent compared to 4 percent for the high P/E set.

Credit Suisse continues to believe that domestic growth is likely to stay muted for the next several quarters. While FY18 GDP growth estimates have been reduced sharply after the 1Q release, FY19 estimates have been left largely unchanged, it said.

Last week Nifty consolidated in a broad range of 200 points (9980-9780). Due to consolidation, daily chart formed a Symmetrical triangle pattern and index confirmed its breakout from said Triangle pattern in Friday’s session.

However, due to geopolitical tension, Nifty nosedived sharply on Monday and entered inside the triangle pattern. The said development has diminished the bullish sentiment.

Going forward, Nifty has an immediate support near 9,850 below which strong support comes near 9,780. Any sustained move below 9,780 will certainly allow bears to take charge of the index and we may see index to retest the daily swing low of 9,685.

On the other side, 9980 -10020 will act as a near term hurdle and only a decisive move above this level will allow the index to retest its all-time high of 10,138.

Options data also indicate towards a range bound movement for the month of September. Heavy call writing has been seen at 10000 strike option and that will act as strong supply zone for Nifty whereas on lower end put writing at 9700 will prove as a support zone.

Here is the list of four stocks which can give up to 12% return in the short term:

M&M Financial: BUY| Target Rs474| Stop Loss Rs409| Time frame 12 to 15 trading sessions| Return 8%

Looking at the weekly chart, stock confirmed its breakout from Bullish Cup & Handle pattern near Rs390 during late July 2017 and rallied towards Rs435.

Subsequently, stock consolidated and formed a triangle pattern on the daily charts. During last week, stock confirmed its break from triangle pattern and closed at an all-time high. The weekly RSI (14) is trading above 60 levels which support our hypothesis.

The pattern target of Cup & Handle comes near Rs528 with a medium to long term perspective. However, the triangle breakout target comes near Rs474.

Considering the above technical evidence, we recommend traders to buy this stock in a range of 420-416 with a price target of 474 and a stop loss of 390.

Apollo Tyres: BUY| Target Rs275| Stop Loss Rs237| Time frame 10 to 12 trading sessions| Return 9%

After posting an all-time high of around Rs288, the stock witnessed a decent profit booking slide towards Rs246. The level of Rs246 coincided with the daily 89-EMA.

Also, the daily RSI (14) took support near 40 as a result stock witnessed decent bounce during last week. Looking at the weekly chart, the stock has formed a three point bearish divergence which was followed by Positive Reversal during last week.

Due to last week rally, the weekly candle resembles a Dragonfly Doji pattern. The said pattern will be activated if the stock closes above candle high of 258. The weekly Higher Top Higher Bottom formation is still intact.

Long unwinding pressure was seen that dragged stock towards 250 levels. However, our view remains bullish for short term and we recommend traders to buy this stock in a range of 250-246 with a price target of 275. Stop loss should be placed below 237.

ONGC: BUY| Target Rs180| Stop loss Rs151| Time Frame 15 to 21 trading session| Return 11%

Looking at the weekly chart, after posting a high of around 210 stock reversed sharply. Subsequently, the fall got arrested near 155 which coincided with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of its entire move from the bottom of around 120 to 210.

The daily RSI (14) indicates a possible shift in range. Hence, we expect this stock to rebound in coming trading session and recommend traders to buy this stock at the current level of 161 with a price target of 180. Stop loss should be placed below 151.

NMDC: BUY| Target Rs150| Stop Loss Rs120.50| Time frame 15 to 20 trading session| Return 12%

Looking at the weekly chart, the stock managed to cross and closed above its previous week hurdle of 130.40. The weekly RSI (14) has also confirmed its breakout on RSI (14) chart.

The daily 9-45 EMA is positive indicating that the current trend is up. Hence, we believe the stock has potential to move higher in a coming trading session.

We advocate traders to buy this stock in a range of 132.50 to 130.50 with a price target of 150. A stop loss should be placed below Rs120.50.

The Sensex has had a stellar run in 2017, rising over 19 percent so far, with the Nifty outperforming the former, up over 21 percent. The market’s rising trajectory has been making fund managers and investors jittery.

The latest to join the chorus is Abhay Laijawala, Managing Director and Head of Research, Deutsche Equities India.

From September 1, 2016 to September 1, 2017, copper is up 46.7%, while zinc, aluminium, lead and nickel are up 35.1%, 33.2%, 23.8%, 23.1%, respectively.

8:12am Bitcoin tumbled the most since July after China's central bank said initial coin offerings are illegal.

South Korea said it was talking to Washington about deploying aircraft carriers and strategic bombers to the Korean peninsula.

US President Donald Trump held calls with foreign leaders, including South Korean President Moon Jae-in and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and the White House declared that “all options to address the North Korean threat are on the table.”

7:27am In global economic cues, Japan’s services sector expanded in August at the slowest rate in six months as the pace of new orders eased, a sign the economy is losing some momentum after this year’s solid gains. The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 51.6 from 52.0 in July.

The Nifty, which opened on a muted note extended losses in the second half of the trading sessions after it breached most of its short-term moving averages on the lower side. The Nifty opened at 9,984 and rose marginally to touch its intraday high of 9,988 but then bears took control and push the index by over 100 points to touch its intraday low of 9,861 — which made a long lower shadow.

Indian state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp plans to bid for Israeli offshore oil-and-gas exploration blocks, India’s oil minister told Reuters, the first major deal between the two countries since a groundbreaking trip by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July.

India and Israel have deep defence ties but Modi and his right wing ruling group are pushing to expand the relationship into other sectors such as energy and technology with a country they see as a natural ally against terrorism.

A high-ranking delegation from India, the world’s third-biggest oil consumer, visited Israel last month to discuss taking part in the tender for blocks in the Mediterranean Sea and Israeli officials said they were pleased with the visit.

“We will definitely bid for Israel’s oil-and-gas blocks,” Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told Reuters.

There was no immediate comment from Israel’s energy ministry.

When Modi visited Israel in July, both sides showed interest to build a broader economic relationship, rather than one based on defence, which had drawn them together because of similar concerns about militant threats they face. They are starting from a relatively low economic base as bilateral trade was just $2 billion in 2016.

Many oil majors have been hesitant to enter the Israeli market, fearing a backlash from oil-rich Arab states hostile to the country.

Israel put 24 exploration blocks up for auction in November 2016 and the country’s energy minister, Yuval Steinitz, has said he would be happy to choose two or three foreign explorations groups. The auction closes on November 15.

India is conducting a technical and commercial analysis to participate in the Israel’s bidding process, said Sanjay Sudhir, a joint secretary in the federal oil ministry, who led the delegation.

“We dove into all the relevant details of the tender - geological, technical - and familiarised them with Israel’s oil and gas ecosystem,” an official at Israel’s Energy Ministry said on the Indian team’s visit, declining to be identified in the absence of permission to speak to the media.

Israel wants to open up its hydrocarbon sector, which is currently dominated by a partnership of Noble Energy and Delek Group. They control the Tamar and the much larger Leviathan fields.

India also wants to participate in the upcoming auction to explore and develop gas fields off the coast of Lebanon, Pradhan said in July. Three of those blocks border waters with Israel, with which Lebanon has a long-standing maritime border dispute.

ONGC is India’s biggest energy exploration firm and a source at its overseas investment arm ONGC Videsh said the firm would not bid for any block in areas disputed by Israel and Lebanon.

“Israel has said that none of the blocks it has offered are in disputed waters,” said the source.

Another state-run explorer, Oil India Ltd, has not yet decided to bid in Israel’s licensing round, the Indian company’s chairman, Utpal Bora, told Reuters.

India’s decision to bid for blocks off Israel and Lebanon comes after a setback in getting development rights for a giant gas field in Iran.

Indian companies discovered the Farzad B gas field in Iran in 2008 and have bid several times for the development rights, but media reports suggest that Tehran has decided to award the field to Russia’s Gazprom.",552,-6.178021430969238e-05

Cash rich Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will raise its first debt ever, of Rs 25,000 crore, to part fund the Rs 37,000 crore acquisition of government's stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL).

India's largest oil and gas producer has about Rs 13,000 crore in cash and would need to borrow the rest to fund the buying of government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL.

ONGC has sought shareholder approval for ""borrowing/ raising funds in Indian rupee and/ or foreign currency by issue of debt instruments (including bonds, non-convertible debentures and notes) in domestic and/ or overseas market"" of Rs 25,000 crore.

The borrowings would be for ""acquisition of projects/ equity shares and/or going concerns, meeting capital expenditure, working capital requirements and general corporate purposes during the period commencing from the date of passing of Special Resolution till completion of twelve months thereof or the date of the next annual general meeting in the financial year 2018-19, whichever is earlier,"" the company said in a shareholder resolution.

The resolution would come up for voting at the company's annual general meeting (AGM) of shareholders on September 27.

The board of ONGC last month gave 'in principle approval' for the acquisition of the government stake in HPCL, which at today trading price of Rs 477.65 is worth about Rs 37,000 crore.

ONGC holds 13.77 per cent stake in IOC, which at today's trading price is worth Rs 28,800 crore. It also holds 4.83 per cent stake in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, which is worth Rs 1,550 crore.

But the company is not likely to sell any of it to fund the HPCL buy, officials said.

A six-member Committee of Directors has been constituted to examine various aspects of the acquisition and to provide its recommendations to the board.

The panel includes Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf and Director (Finance) A K Srinivasan as also independent directors K M Padmanabhan, Sumit Bose and Vivek Mallya.

Director (Technology & Field Services) Shashi Shanker, who has been selected to succeed Sarraf as the chairman of ONGC at the end of September, will also be part of the panel.

The official said the acquisition will be done as per the Sebi takeover code. The price most likely will be 6-month average of HPCL scrip on the day of the decision.

The government last month had approved sale of its 51.11 per cent stake in oil refiner HPCL to India's largest oil producer ONGC.

Prior to the merger, HPCL is likely to take over Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) to bring all the refining assets of ONGC under one unit. ONGC currently owns 71.63 per cent of MRPL while HPCL has 16.96 per cent stake in it.

The official said ONGC will not have to make an open offer to minority shareholders of HPCL as the government's holding is being transferred to another state-run firm and the ownership is not changing.

The deal will be completed within a year, he said. HPCL will become a subsidiary of ONGC and will remain a listed company post the acquisition, the source said, adding that the board of the refining and marketing company will continue to remain separate.

The government has also constituted a committee -- headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan and road minister Nitin Gadkari to work out the modalities of the sale.

Jaitley had, in his Budget for 2017-18, talked about creating an integrated oil behemoth. After that oil companies were asked to give their options.

ONGC had evaluated options of acquiring either HPCL or BPCL -- the two downstream oil refining and fuel marketing companies.

It found the nation's second-biggest fuel retailer BPCL too expensive and conveyed its choice to the parent oil ministry.

Sources said the transaction is likely to be completed within the current financial year, ending March 31, 2018.

HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.",685,-0.9988126754760742

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) said it plans to double gas production to over 100 million standard cubic meters per day in the next 5-6 years.

In a statement issued on Independence Day celebrations at the company's headquarters in Dehradun, ONGC said despite tumbling oil prices in the last three years, it not only sustained production from existing fields through incremental inputs but has also taken large meaningful and calculated investment decisions to ensure sustained volumes and financial growth.

Government is targeting increase in share of gas in the energy basket from 6.5 per cent to 15 per cent in the next few years.

ONGC said 17 projects with a combined capex of Rs 76,000 crore have been approved in the last three years.

""These projects would produce 69 million tonnes of crude oil and 118 billion cubic meters of natural gas during their profile period. Cumulative production from these projects would peak during 2020-21 at 6.65 million tonnes of crude and 13.38 BCM of gas which is 45 per cent of company's oil and gas standalone production during FY17,"" it said.

Its flagship project includes Cluster-II in Bay of Bengal block KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5). The project would produce about 25 million tonnes of oil and 50 BCM of gas over the life of the project with peak production of 4 million tonnes of oil and 5.5 BCM of gas.

This would be equivalent to 17 per cent and 24 per cent of ONGC's current standalone oil and gas production, respectively.

During the last three years, ONGC completed 15 production related projects (including 8 brownfield and 7 greenfield) with capital investment of Rs 54,000 crore.

""These would produce 87 million tonnes of crude and 56 BCM of gas during their profile period,"" the statement said, adding during FY17, ONGC produced 5 million tonnes of crude and 3.5 BCM of gas from these projects, which is 22 per cent and 16 per cent of its standalone crude and gas production, respectively.

Stating that it made 23 hydrocarbon finds with a total reserve accretion of 65 million tonnes of oil equivalent in 2016-17, ONGC said its onshore assets have reversed declining trend in production, persisting for several years, by registering crude production at 5.97 million tonnes in FY17 as against 5.82 million tonnes in FY16.",427,0.9655586779117584

PwC, JM Financial and ICICI Securities are among the five consultants vying to become transaction adviser to the government's over Rs 33,000 crore stake sale in HPCL to ONGC.

EY and Rothschild (India) Pvt Ltd are the other two who have submitted an expression of interest (EoI) to the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management's (DIPAM) invitation to professional consulting firms and investment/merchant bankers for managing the disinvestment process, official sources said.

DIPAM is looking to appoint one adviser for the strategic sale and also a law firm with experience and expertise in mergers and acquisitions or takeovers or strategic disinvestment.

Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, Crawford Bayley & Company, Luthra & Luthra, Suman Khaitan & Company and Hammurabi & Solomon Partners are in the race for the legal consultant.

Sources said DIPAM has invited the bidders to make a presentation on Friday after which it will open price bids.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on July 19 given 'in-principle' approval for a strategic sale of the government's existing 51.11 percent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) along with the transfer of management control.

At the current market price, the HPCL stake is valued at more than Rs 33,300 crore.

The merchant banker would assist the government on ""modalities of disinvestment and the timing"" as well as recommend the need for intermediaries required for the process, according to the notice inviting bids.

It would do a business valuation of HPCL, structure the transaction, suggest measures to fetch optimum value and assess positioning of the strategic sale.

Besides, it will also prepare all documents like information memorandum (IM), confidentiality agreement and transaction agreements such as agreement to sale and share purchase agreement.

The legal adviser would review and advise on all legal contracts, titles of properties/assets/real estate, intellectual property rights and contracts with employees.

It will also draft transaction related documents and advise on the structure of the transaction including compliance with SEBI guidelines and stock exchange listing norms.

Sources said the government is keen to complete the transaction within the current fiscal.",362,

The government has tweaked the terms of sale of its 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC by including phrases that will help avoid triggering an open offer, an official said.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on July 19 granted 'in-principle' approval for strategic sale of the government's existing 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) ""along with the transfer of management control, which will result in HPCL becoming a subsidiary company of ONGC"".

The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) had on July 21 used the same formulation to invite expression of interest from investment and merchant bankers to manage the transaction.

But, since the offer meant transfer of management control from government to ONGC, there was apprehension it would trigger Sebi's takeover code and compel ONGC to make an open offer to acquire an additional 26 per cent stake from the minority shareholders, he said.

So, DIPAM on August 7 amended the terms to state that ""HPCL will continue to be a Government company in terms of section 2(45) of the Companies Act, 2013 and will continue to be controlled by the Government of India through ONGC under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas"".

Though the government is cashing out on its holding, the amended terms make it clear that it will continue to retain control of HPCL, the official said, adding since there is no transfer of actual control, there would be no requirement of an open offer.

At today's trading price of Rs 431.85, ONGC would have to pay Rs 33,633 crore for buying government's 51.11 per cent stake. Had it been required to make an open offer, it would have had to shell out another Rs 17,100 crore to buy another 26 per cent from open market.

Another official said ONGC will have to borrow about Rs 25,000 crore to fund just the purchase of government stake.

Half of the company's Rs 15,000 crore of cash has already gone into buying Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's stake in a KG basin gas block, and after accounting for capital expenditure requirement for the current year, ONGC would be left with Rs 4,000-5,000 crore.

The rest will have to be borrowed, he said.

Another change DIPAM made in the July 21 Request for Proposal (RFQ) by saying it wants to engage one advisor from reputed professional consulting firms/ investment bankers/ merchant bankers/ financial institutions/ banks for managing the disinvestment process, and not two as was advertised previously.

Besides, one reputed law firm with experience and expertise in mergers and acquisitions or takeovers or strategic disinvestment would be appointed to act as legal adviser, according to the notice inviting bids.

Bids have been invited for consultants and legal adviser by August 10, the notice said.

The official said the government is keen to complete the transaction within the current fiscal.

A fight has broken out between state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd and Gujarat government entity Gujarat State Petronet Ltd (GSPL) over who should transport natural gas Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will produce from its KG basin gas fields.

While GAIL wants to lay a small 13.6-km line from Odalarevu in Andhra Pradesh - the landfall point of ONGC's Bay of Bengal gas - to connect to its existing pipeline grid in the region, GSPL India Transco Ltd wants to lay a 50-km line to take the gas to its proposed Mallavaram-Bhopal-Bhilwara- Vijaipur cross country pipeline (MBBVPL).

GAIL says its pipeline would cost Rs 85.36 crore while GSPL India Transco Ltd's pipeline would cost Rs 250 crore.

The two companies have filed applications before the sectoral regulator PNGRB for authorisation for laying the pipelines, known as tie-in lines that connect a gas source with main pipeline.

State-owned ONGC has over a dozen natural gas discoveries in Bay of Bengal which it plans to put them to production in phases. Gas from offshore is to be brought to Odalarevu from where it is to be taken to users through existing gas transporters.

GSPL India Transco Ltd (GITL) on June 29 wrote to PNGRB saying it ""is soon going to develop a pipeline connecting, MBBVPL and ONGC Odalarevu terminal"".

It said gas sources in KG basins were considered part of gas sourcing plan when MBBVPL was conceived and authorised by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) in 2011.

The Rs 8,086 crore MBBVPL was to be commissioned by December 2017 but the project has not yet taken off because of lack of gas source.

""You would appreciate that MBBVPL is the least cost option to transport gas from ONGC KG basin to central, western and northern regions of India owing to its tariff being most competitive,"" GITL wrote.

A special purpose vehicle promoted by Gujarat State Petronet Ltd (GSPL) where IOC, BPCL and HPCL hold minority stakes, GITL said it has been in discussion with ONGC on the issue.

""ONGC is keen, and has requested GITL to establish connectivity between MBBVLP and ONGC"", it said, adding that it would be achieved by December 2018.

GAIL, on the other hand, has contested GITL's assertion that ONGC's S1 deep water and S1-VA fields in Bay of Bengal were ever marked as gas sources for MBBVPL.

""It is doubtful whether the operator ONGC themselves knew about it. As a mater of fact, ONGC has already invited competitive bids for sale of gas from the said fields and there seems to be no restrictions imposed in it sating that the gas available from these fields would have to be evacuated/transported only through MBBVPL,"" GAIL wrote to PNGRB.

It said ONGC had on June 21, 2017 written to PNGRB seeking GAIL to lay the tie-in connectivity from its S1-VA fields (ex-Odalarevu).

""ONGC has also stated that neither ONGC nor GAIL can afford any delay in the tie-in connectivity approval process and has specifically requested PNGRB to expedite the approval of the GAIL's tie-in connectivity from ONGC's SA-VA fields. So GITL's claims, otherwise, are not supported by ONGC,"" GAIL said.

GAIL said its KG basin pipeline is already in existing pipeline which clearly is not the case with GITL's MBBVPL.

PNGRB is yet to give its authorisation to either of the two.",585,-0.501990795135498

Edelweiss' research report on ONGC

ONGC’s Q1FY18 EBITDAX of INR99bn (up 7% YoY, down 11% QoQ) came 15% ahead of estimate on lower opex and robust production. PAT at INR39bn, however, came 7% below on higher taxes and lower other income. Cash costs per barrel came 6% below estimate due to production efficiencies driven by improved rig productivity and lower rig rates. We expect ONGC’s INR800bn projects under implementation to significantly revive production, primarily gas (FY18/19E growth of 13%/10%). Rising gas production along with likely higher oil and gas prices portend brighter prospects FY18 onwards. Maintain ‘BUY’ with TP of INR201.

Outlook

Despite strong near‐term growth prospects (FY17‐19E EPS CAGR of 16%), valuations are undemanding at 8x FY19E PER. We maintain ‘BUY/SO’ with target price of INR201.

Kicking off the process for sale of HPCL stake to ONGC, the government has invited bids for appointing merchant bankers and legal consultants for the Rs 28,000-crore deal.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has sought pricing and marketing freedom to help bring to production a one-trillion cubic feet gas discovery that will open up a new sedimentary basin after over three decades.

ONGC, which has opened for commercial production six out of India's seven producing basins, has made a significant natural gas discovery in the Gulf of Kutch of Gujarat coast that can produce about three million standard cubic meters per day, a senior company official said.

This will open up the country's eighth sedimentary basin - the first in over three decades - for oil and gas production in two years.

""We can bring to production the find in 2-3 years time,"" he said.

ONGC reviewed the project with Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan last week and set out conditions that will help monetise the gas reserves.

""The present government-mandated gas price of USD 2.48 per million British thermal unit does not make the discovery commercially viable. Since the find is in shallow waters, it does not qualify to get the USD 5.56 per mmBtu cap price set for difficult fields,"" the official said.

The current rates of gas are uneconomic, he added.

""We have asked the government to give us pricing and marketing freedom. What sense does it make to use precious foreign exchange to pay USD 6-7 for importing gas and not pay an equivalent amount to domestic producers. Afterall, any domestic production would only aid government's Make-in-India initiative,"" he said.

India has 26 sedimentary basins, of which only seven have commercial production of oil and gas. Except for the Assam shelf, ONGC opened up for commercial production all the other six basins, including Cambay, Mumbai Offshore, Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari, Cauvery and Assam-Arakan Fold Belt.

The official said the discovery made in the Gulf of Kutch is in shallow waters, but cannot be tied to either the production facilities in Mumbai High fields or Hazira and may require a new landfall point.

The BJP-led government had in October 2014 evolved a new pricing formula using rates prevalent in gas surplus nations like the US, Canada and Russia to determine rates in a net importing country.

Prices have halved to USD 2.48 per mmBtu since the formula was implemented.

India's largest natural gas producer is demanding a floor or minimum price of natural gas be fixed at USD 4.2 per mmBtu and rates freed in a years time.

""We hope the government listens to us,"" the official said. ""We should be able to bring the new find to production within 2-3 years from the date they give us for the requisite approvals,"" he said.",482,-0.10557474692662557

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) has won government approval for acquisition of Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation's (GSPC) entire 80 percent holding in a KG basin gas block for Rs 7,738 crore, the company said.

ONGC had in December last year agreed to buy entire 80 percent interest of GSPC along with operatorship rights, in Deen Dayal West (DDW) gas field in Block KG-OSN-2001/3 in the Bay of Bengal for USD 995 million (Rs 6,443 crore).

The company will also pay part consideration of USD 200 million (Rs 1,295 crore) to GSPC towards acquisition rights for discoveries other than DDW field in the block.

""A farm-in agreement was signed with GSPC on March 10, 2017 with an economic data of March 31, 2017,"" ONGC said in notes to its first quarter earning disclosure.

During April-June quarter, ""Government of India has approved the acquisition of entire 80 percent participating interest of GSPC along with operatorship rights,"" it said.

ONGC will make payments to GSPC ""on fulfilment of certain conditions precedent,"" it said without elaborating.

A company official said the deal is likely to be closed within one month.

ONGC will pay USD 995.26 million for three discoveries in the KG-OSN-2001/3 block that are under trial production since August 2014. Another USD 200 million will be paid for six other discoveries for which GSPC has been finalising an investment plan to bring them to production.

Jubilant Offshore Drilling Pvt Ltd and Geo Global Resources (India) Inc hold 10 percent stake in the block.

Originally, GSPC had offered ONGC its 50 percent stake in the block together with operatorship, but the state-owned firm was not interested. Subsequently, GSPC offered its entire 80 percent stake in the block and ONGC on December 23 last year.

GSPC, with a debt of Rs 19,716.27 crore as on March 31, 2015, has so far made 9 gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal block. Of these, three - KG-08, KG-17, KG-15 commonly known as Deendayal West (DDW) fields - have been approved for development.

But against an approved field development plan (FDP) cost of USD 2.75 billion, GSPC has seen a huge cost overrun, incurring USD 2.83 billion as on March 31, 2015. Additionally, it had run up an exploration cost of USD 584.63 million, taking total expenditure as on March 31, 2015, to USD 3.41 billion.

As per the requirement of the field development plan (FDP), 12 more development wells are yet to be completed, which will further bump up the project cost.

The trial production from the DDW field commenced in August 2014, but the average production achieved is only 19.45 million standard cubic feet per day against a targeted commercial production of 200 mmscfd.

Commercial production has not commenced as the rate has not yet stabilised. The DGH-approved FDP had envisaged commercial production from December 2011.

The official said FDP for the six remaining discoveries - KG-16, KG-22, KG-31, KG-21, KG-19 and KG-20SS - is under review of GSPC.

As per the approved FDP of DDW fields, the estimated oil and gas in place (OGIP) was 1.95 trillion cubic feet (tcf).",552,0.8733446598052979

ONGC's financial ratios will remain largely unchanged if it funds the Rs 28,000 crore acquisition of HPCL through sale of its minority stake in IOC and GAIL, S&P Global Ratings said.

The rating agency said that the Indian government's approval to sell its majority 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd (ONGC) is likely to be credit neutral for the state explorer.

It however did not see much benefit in combining of HPCL's downstream oil refining and fuel marketing business with ONGC's oil and gas production.

""We do not expect any significant synergy between ONGC's upstream operations and HPCL's downstream operations although it will provide some diversity. Also, a complete merger of ONGC and HPCL is unlikely because we believe that will have significant challenges in integrating the people, systems, and corporate culture,"" it said in a statement.

ONGC has a 71.63 per cent stake in Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, which has a capacity of 15 million tonnes per year. Combining this with HPCL's similar refining capacity and about 15,000 fuel retail stations could help derive some procurement benefits.

S&P said if ONGC exercises the option of divesting its minority stakes in other state-run oil and gas companies to fund the acquisition of the HPCL stake, ONGC's financial metrics will be largely unchanged. However, using debt to fund the HPCL stake will put pressure on ONGC's stand-alone credit profile.

S&P said the deal could take six months to complete and ONGC would be able to secure the necessary approval from the government and regulatory bodies to avoid triggering a mandatory open offer to buy an additional 26 per cent stake in HPCL from the public.

ONGC's financial ratios, it said, will remain largely unchanged if it funds the HPCL stake purchase by selling its stakes in IOC and GAIL.

""We expect ONGC's ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt to remain at 35-40 per cent over the next two to three years post the proposed transaction,"" it said.

ONGC has 13.77 per cent stake in IOC, valued at Rs 25,400 crore and 4.87 per cent stake in GAIL (India) Ltd, valued at Rs 3,100 crore.

""We believe ONGC -- with the required approvals -- can sell these stakes in the open market to fund the HPCL deal. However, the divestment may be gradual and ONGC could meanwhile fund the HPCL stake purchase using a bridge loan,"" it said.

The rating agency said if ONGC funds the deal with debt of about USD 4.5 billion, the company's FFO-to-debt ratio to trend towards 30 per cent -- below the trigger for a lower assessment of rating -- potentially resulting in at least a one notch lower.

In addition, if ONGC makes an open offer for the additional 26 per cent stake, the company will need to pay out a further Rs 14,500 crore, potentially resulting in a lower rating assessment by two notches.

The deal is a part of the government's announcement to create an integrated national oil major by combining several of its state-owned oil and gas companies.

""However, we believe the government's intention may be to have a few large integrated oil companies instead of one big integrated national oil major. Still, such combined entities will be small in comparison to global oil majors,"" it said.

Combining HPCL will improve ONGC's cash flow stability and operating scale to an extent. However, there will be no material change in ONGC's business risk profile.

This is because HPCL's pre-tax profit is relatively modest -- about 25 per cent of ONGC's. HPCL will remain a majority-owned subsidiary of ONGC.",651,-0.1398187960897173

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has given in-principle approval for the sale of the government's 51.11 per cent stake along with the management control of HPCL to the ONGC, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said today.

Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) will continue as a public sector undertaking after Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) acquires its stake, the minister said in the Lok Sabha.

""The proposed acquisition in the oil sector will create a vertically integrated public sector oil major company having presence across the entire value chain.

""This will give ONGC an enhanced capacity to bear higher risks, take higher investment decisions and to neutralise impact of global crude oil price volatility,"" Pradhan said.

ONGC will not be required to make an open offer to minority shareholders of HPCL after buying out government's 51.11 per cent stake as the deal won't trigger takeover norms as did the IOC-IBP merger in 2002, a senior government official said.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) last week gave in-principal approval of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) buying out government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in fuel retailing and marketing company Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd. HPCL will continue to be a separate listed company.

ONGC will not have to make an open offer to minority shareholders of HPCL as the government's holding is being transferred to another state-run firm and the ownership isn't really changing.

""Open offer is not required because the management complexion is not changing. So it is a related party transaction,"" the officer said.

As per Sebi's takeover code, if a company acquires more than 25 per cent in another listed company, it has to make an open offer to minority shareholders to buy at least 26 percent more in the target firm.

Way back in February 2002, state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) had acquired government's 33.58 per cent stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd for Rs 1,153.68 crore and had to make an open offer for additional shares.

""IOC and IBP merger had happened through bidding route. Reliance Industries was among the bidders. That time, IBP was being offered for outright sale, so when management chose to sell through bidding, the open offer got triggered,"" the official said, requesting anonymity.

In the present case, ""in ONGC, I am transferring from direct government control to indirect holding,"" he said.

Government is 51 percent owner of HPCL and 68 per cent owner of ONGC.

""So, if one of the companies keeps the shares of the other, it is a related party transaction. But that does not mean government has sold the company. Government will indirectly hold stake in the company.

""It is a related party transaction which should not trigger takeover code unless the valuations are absurd. If those conditions are satisfied, it will never happen. We have kept in mind interest of both ONGC and HPCL,"" the official said.

The deal, which flows from Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's Budget announcement of creating an integrated oil company, will help ONGC spread its risks.

From being a mere oil and gas producer, it will also have downstream oil refining and fuel retailing business. ""When upstream business is down, downstream does great and vice versa. So now ONGC will be able to better manage its risks,"" he said. ""Through this vertical integration, what private sector could not achieve, the government has achieved,"" he added.

HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.

ONGC already is majority owner of MRPL, which has a 15- million tons refinery.

The government has invited applications for a transaction advisors and legal advisors for the strategic sale of government’s stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) to Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which received in-principle approval from the Cabinet for a merger on Wednesday.

The Department of Investment & Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has invited proposals from the interested parties for managing the disinvestment process by August 10, 2017 in an advertisement published in the leading dailies today.

Interested parties can visit the website of dipam.gov.in; hindustanpetroleum.com and petroleum.nic.in for more information.

The deal will create an integrated public sector oil major, allowing it to compete with private and foreign players in a better way. The combined entity would be able to match the performance of international and private sector oil and gas companies with economies of scale.

Following the merger, ONGC would become the third largest refiner in the country.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget speech had spoken of creating a domestic integrated oil major.

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, DK Sarraf, Chairman of ONGC, said the company will not need minority shareholder’s nod and will be exempted from making an open offer.

HPCL will remain a listed subsidiary of the company and the deal is likely to be completed in this financial year.",227,0.9999953508377075

HPCL fell sharply by 5 percent but ONGC gained nearly 3 percent in morning trade Thursday after the Union Cabinet on Wednesday gave an in-principle approval to the proposed acquisition of government’s 51.1 percent stake in the oil marketing company by PSU oil giant.

After the acquisition, ONGC will have exposure to exploration, production, refining and marketing of the fuel in both India and abroad.

The stake sale will result in HPCL becoming an ONGC subsidiary though the capital market regulator may exempt the latter from making an open offer to buy another 26 percent stake from the public.

As per the norms of Securities and Exchange Board of India, a company has to make an open offer to buy another 26 percent of the target company if it buys 25 percent or more in the latter.

HPCL's equity comprises 1.01 billion shares. At Wednesday's closing price of Rs 384 on the BSE, ONGC will have to shell out Rs 19,938 crore to buy the government's 519.23 million shares in HPCL.

The stake sale, thus will help the the government achieve a third of its FY18 disinvestment target of Rs 72,500 crore. The government has so far raised Rs 7,896.97 crore through stake sales.

The government aims to achieve its disinvestment target by raising Rs 46,500 crore via minority stake sales, Rs 15,000 crore through strategic stake sales and Rs 11,000 crore from the listing of various public sector insurance companies.

The challenges to the gigantic acquisition will be more administrative and legal than financial. Both ONGC and HPCL were formed by Acts of Parliament and the stake sale will thus need Parliamentary approval, a not-so-easy exercise in an opposition-dominated Upper House.

This consolidation exercise involving an oil and gas explorer acquiring stake in a refining and marketing company goes in line with the government’s intention to create an integrated energy company, as spelt out by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his 2017-18 Union Budget.

The international oil and gas sector is dominated by state-owned energy giants — some exceptions being ExxonMobil, Chevron Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell — and this amalgamation will give ONGC the wherewithal to shop more aggressively for foreign assets.

At 09:41 hours IST, the stock price of ONGC was quoting at Rs 166.45, up 2.09 percent while Hindustan Petroleum Corporation was at Rs 372.15, down 3.09 percent on the BSE.",405,0.3458220760027568

National Confederation of Human Rights Organisations (NCHRO) today urged ONGC to publish a white paper on its ongoing oil exploration operations and future plans in Cauvery delta areas in the district.

A team of NCHRO, the umbrella body of various human rights and civil rights organisations and activists, led by its Chairperson Prof A Marx,had last week visited Kathiramangalam, Kuthalam, Vilamal and Adiyakkamangalam, where ONGC is conducting the explorations.

They interacted with the villagers who have been protesting over the last two weeks against the exploration by the oil major as they fear it would affect the environment and also their livelihood, NCHRO sources said.

They team held discussions with ONGC officials regarding the projects and submitted a report with various suggestions to the government and the PSU. It urged the government to release 10 persons arrested for protesting against ONGC's operations and withdrawal of cases filed against them.

The team also wanted the Government to constitute a panel headed by a High Court judge to study the environmental impact due to ONGC's operations in the Cauvery delta region. The panel should include technical and industry experts besides doctors and human rights activists.

Noting that ONGC's operations in Kathiramangalam had been suspended temporarily due to local protest,the team urged the government to stop ONGC's activities till the apprehensions of the people are allayed.

On June 30, several persons, including two policemen, were injured when some locals and activists allegedly belonging to opposition parties, reportedly indulged in violence while protesting a 'leak' in an ONGC pipe, leading to lathicharge at Kathiramangalam.",303,-0.9992759227752686

State-owned HPCL will invest Rs 61,000 crore over the next four years in expanding and upgrading its existing refining capacity to meet higher quality fuel norms, the company said in an investor presentation.

HPCL is upgrading both its Mumbai and Visakh refineries to produce fuel meeting Euro-VI emission norms.

""Major planned investments in refinery, POL (petroleum, oil and lubricants) distribution and natural gas projects,"" the company said in the presentation.

Explainer: How Daily Revision Of Petrol, Diesel Prices Works

It will invest Rs 20,928 crore in expanding its Visakh refinery in Andhra Pradesh from 8.33 million tonnes per annum to 15 million tonnes by July 2020.

Also, the Mumbai refinery is being expanded to 9.5 million tonnes a year from current 7.5 million tonnes at a cost of Rs 4,199 crore.

The investment plans are irrespective of the proposal by Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) to buy out the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL. Since HPCL will turn into a subsidiary of ONGC if the proposal gets government nod, the investment plans would not change, an official explained.

The Cabinet may this month accord approval to ONGC's proposal.

HPCL said it plans to expand Mundra-Delhi, Visakh- Vijayawada and Ramanmandi-Bahadurgarh pipelines to meet rising fuel demand.

Besides, new LPG lines will be laid and bottling plants set up to cater to the increased demand for cooking gas.

HPCL said it is building a new 9 million tonnes per annum refinery-cum-petrochemical complex at Pachpadra in Rajasthan and a petrochemical complex at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh.

It also holds a 25 per cent interest in the mega 60 million tonnes refinery state-owned firms led by Indian Oil Corp (IOC) plan to build on the west coast in Maharashtra.

It, however, did not give costings of the projects.

Of the Rs 61,000 crore to be invested till 2021, Rs 23,400 crore will be in refining, Rs 23,600 crore in marketing infrastructure and another Rs 13,000 crore in joint venture projects.

The joint venture projects include the west coast refinery, petrochemical complex at Kakinada, a 5 million tonnes LNG import terminal at Chhara in Gujarat and a fuel farm facilities at Mumbai airport.

In the current fiscal, the company has outlaid a capex of Rs 7,110 crore as compared to Rs 5,860 crore in the previous financial year, the presentation said.

Besides, the two refineries at Mumbai and Visakh, HPCL owns 14,412 petrol pumps and 4,532 LPG distributor agencies in the country.

The company, which had a net profit of Rs 2 crore in 1973-74, posted a record Rs 6,209 crore net in 2016-17.

HPCL said its borrowings have come down to Rs 21,250 crore as on March 2017 from Rs 33,789 crore in March 2013. Net worth has risen from Rs 13,726 crore to Rs 20,347 crore in the same period.",480,0.7823935747146606

Continuing their opposition to the ONGC's oil exploration project in their village near here, residents resorted to a novel protest by setting up a community kitchen and used firewood for the same.

Around 200 residents of Kathiramangalam village had yesterday set up a community kitchen and used firewood instead of LPG in a bid to rebuff ONGC's statement that it had to drill wells to supply LPG to households, police said.

Women gathered in the open yard of an Ayyanaar temple in the village and prepared food from the morning using firewood. The protesters said they could manage with firewood as they had been doing so before the advent of LPG.

The villagers have been up in arms against crude oil exploration by ONGC and a protest by them had turned violent on June 30, leading to use of ""minimum force"" by police, which was criticised by opposition parties in the state.

Indian energy company ONGC Videsh will bid in an upcoming auction to explore and develop gas fields off the coast of Lebanon, India's oil minister said on Monday.

ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of India's top explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp, is among several companies prequalified to bid for offshore exploration and production licences from the Middle Eastern nation.

Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan, leading a delegation at the World Petroleum Congress in Istanbul, made the comment in a Tweet after meeting with Lebanese Energy and Water Minister Cesar Abou Khalil.

""The meeting was important in the context of ONGC Videsh's participation in the upcoming bid round for offshore gas fields in Lebanon,"" Pradhan said.

The bidding process for offshore blocks 1, 4, 8, 9 and 10, three of which border Israeli waters, was postponed for years because of political paralysis in Lebanon until the formation of a new government late last year.

Lebanon, along with Cyprus, Israel and Egypt, sits on the Levant basin in the Mediterranean where gas fields have been discovered since 2009.

Cash-hungry Venezuela has offered Indian oil company ONGC Videsh an increased stake in an oil field, according to two sources close to the proposal, as the country seeks to shore up its bruised energy industry and strengthen ties with New Delhi.

State oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) has proposed selling a 9 percent stake in the San Cristobal field to ONGC Videsh (OVL), a subsidiary of India's state-owned top explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp , the sources said this week.

ONGC Videsh already holds a 40 percent stake in the field, which produces around 22,000-23,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil. While the amount of the sale would be relatively modest, according to analysts, any extra income would be welcome for PDVSA.

Explainer: How Daily Revision Of Petrol, Diesel Prices Works

Venezuela, struggling under triple-digit inflation and Soviet-style product shortages as its socialist economy unravels, has been hit hard by the falling price of oil, its economic lifeline.

The OPEC nation's oil output has slipped and PDVSA is struggling to maintain investment in its oilfields, which hold the world's largest crude reserves.

The state company already offered Russian oil major Rosneft a stake in a joint venture in an extra-heavy crude project in the Orinoco Belt, sources told Reuters in March.

The sources, who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak about the negotiations, said PDVSA was still negotiating with ONGC and no deal was certain.

Under Venezuela's hydrocarbon law, the state must maintain more than 50 percent of all oil ventures, hence PDVSA can only offer up to 9 percent to the Indian firm.

""ONGC is still evaluating the options,"" one of the sources said, adding the purchase could be challenging given the Indian company's revenues are suffering due to lower oil prices.

ONGC Videsh managing director N. K. Verma declined to comment. PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

LEGAL QUANDARY

Another potential complication is Venezuela's murky legal framework during a power struggle between the opposition and the unpopular leftist government of President Nicolas Maduro.

A controversial decision by the Supreme Court in April gave the government the right to cut oil deals but the constitution mandates that the National Assembly, controlled by the opposition, must approve contracts of ""national public interest.""

Opposition lawmakers say oil deals which bypass the legislature are therefore null. They have been warning foreign companies away from what they say are firesale deals that throw a lifeline to Maduro's government.

""Any change to the shareholding structure of a joint venture should be approved by (congress),"" wrote Jose Guerra, president of the congressional finance committee, in a message to Reuters.

Asked if such a change would be approved by the legislature, he responded ""I don't think so. The government has refused to present those issues to (Congress).""

The business climate remains poor in the volatile and violent South American country, which is labouring under shortages of food and medicine. More than three months of protests have left at least 90 people dead.

Recent comments by a Socialist Party candidate about a new legislative superbody created by Maduro have also spooked some in the oil sector. Hermann Escarra, a constitutional lawyer, suggested during a speech at PDVSA that the future constituent assembly could rewrite parts of the constitution that allow joint ventures with foreign oil companies.

Still, as Maduro's government has no easy sources of financing beyond the oil sector, foreign oil companies stand to get a good price for assets on sale.

The second source said there was no clear figure for the potential deal, although a decision was expected this year.

Although it is tricky to estimate a price without full details, a 9 percent stake in San Cristobal could be worth $50 million to $100 million, estimated Luisa Palacios, senior managing director at Medley Global Advisors. She based her estimate on Rosneft paying $500 million to raise its stake in the Petromonagas joint venture last year.

The number is likely to be on the lower end of that range due to Venezuela's political turbulence and business climate, she added.

BOOST TO BILATERAL RELATIONS?

The potential deal could also help once closer relations between Caracas and New Delhi that have taken a hit as Venezuela's economy unravelled.

PDVSA spent at least a decade trying to build business ties and boost shipments to refineries in India.

But the Caracas-based company was forced to abandon the fight for coveted market share there because of its declining output and heavy obligations under oil-for-loan deals with China and Russia, a Reuters analysis showed in March.

Changing trade routes, triggered by rising shale oil production in the United States, turned New Delhi to cheaper oil from Africa and the Middle East.

Venezuela's downward spiral also hurt Indian oil companies, which are owed late dividends.

There are signs the situation may be improving, however.

After years of negotiations, PDVSA last year agreed to clear a pending dividend of $540 million on ONGC Videsh's investment in San Cristobal.

In return, the first source said, ONGC Videsh was now aiming to arrange a $325 million loan for development of the block this year.",905,-0.1943431720137596

Edelweiss' research report on ONGC

Our interaction with Mr. D. K. Sarraf, Chairman‐cum‐Managing Director (CMD), ONGC, reinforced our confidence in the company’s prospects, the recent fall in oil price notwithstanding, given: robust gas growth: Upcoming projects will boost gas output 10%, oil will grow at 2‐3% in FY18; gas prices are poised to rise from H2FY18 despite falling oil; enhanced production cost efficiencies driven by improving rig productivity, falling rig rates and high exploration success; major upcoming projects will remain viable—Eastern (KG) offshore project (USD5bn) will be value accretive at premium prices for difficult fields (IRR in mid‐teens) and Vankor will be value accretive despite tight fiscal regime; and capex (standalone, OVL) will largely be funded via internal accruals. However, we perceive neartermearnings risk due to falling oil prices. Retain ‘BUY’ with TP of INR202.

Outlook

Despite strong near‐term growth prospects (FY17‐19E EPS CAGR of 17%), valuations are undemanding at 7xFY19PER. We maintain ‘BUY/SO’ with target price of INR202.

State-run ONGC has rescinded the initial pacts for outsourcing production from its ageing fields in Gujarat and Assam to international service providers Schlumberger and Halliburton after the oil ministry objected to the contract being handed over without bidding.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had on December 7 last year signed Summary of Understanding (SoU) to give its Kalol field in Gujarat to Halliburton and Geleki field in Assam to Schlumberger to help in raising production above the current baseline output.

Though the agreements were signed in presence of Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan during the bi-annual Petrotech Conference, the ministry felt it was not proper to give away such contracts on nomination basis, sources privy to the development said.

The ministry in no uncertain terms told ONGC that such nomination contracts will not be acceptable, they said.

The ONGC board, which had approved the MoU, thereafter too took a similar and cancelled the SoUs, they said.

The company last week invited expression of interest (EoI) from service providers for undertaking production enhancement from its mature oil and gas fields.

The 15-year Production Enhancement Contract (PEC) will require the oilfield service producer to commit to invest in capital expenditure and operating expenditure to increase production form the existing 'baseline' output.

""The remuneration model will be a tariff which is to be paid in USD per barrel of oil and USD per million British thermal unit for gas for any 'incremental' hydrocarbon produced and saved over the baseline,"" the EoI said. ""Baseline shall be prepared by ONGC and vetted and certified by a third party of international repute.""

All the oil and gas produced will belong to ONGC and the service provider arrangement is being entered into to get the best technology available, sources said.

Under the terms of SoUs signed in December last year, Schlumberger and Halliburton were to invest capital and share technical expertise in the two stagnant but producing oilfields. If they are able to increase output, they were to be paid a pre-determined fee on each additional barrel of crude oil produced. Besides Schlumberger and Halliburton, ONGC was also in talks with Weatherford International and Baker Hughes Inc for similar arrangement for other fields.

But after the oil ministry disapproval, all such deals are off and all such contracts will be entered only when a service provider offers the highest increase in output in a competitive bidding, sources said.",444,0.7977636754512787

With Prime Minister Narendra Modi setting steep target of cutting reliance on imports, the petroleum ministry has intensified monitoring of oil and gas fields given to state-owned firms like ONGC.

Modi had in March 2015 called for cutting India's dependence on imports to meet its oil needs by 10 per cent by 2022 from 77 per cent then.

Import dependence has since only risen to 81 per cent.

""Most of our production of oil and gas come from nomination fields with ONGC and Oil India. We have now started monitoring those fields and have given new benchmarks to the national oil companies to increase production,"" Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said at an industry event.

Explainer: How Daily Revision Of Petrol, Diesel Prices Works

He said oil recovery from reservoirs internationally is 35 to 40 per cent and that for gas is 55 to 70 per cent.

""In India, the current recovery factors of ONGC and Oil India for crude oil are as low as 27 per cent and 23 per cent. In case of natural gas, it is 54 per cent and 43 per cent for ONGC and Oil India, respectively,"" he said.

Pradhan said there is a need for introducing new thinking, new technologies and remaining ahead of the curve.

""I am told E&P sector should have major investment in 'Internet of Things'. Digital oil fields, all infrastructure linked to the network, ability to monetise micro reserves are the new areas we need to look at,"" he said.

He cited the example of a marginal oil field in Vienna where sensors and small in-house innovations were used to reduce cost of production and monetise small gas production.

""In contrast, in India we have practices like having idle rigs and other assets; unscientific inventory and HR management; flaring of gas and remaining which are keeping us behind the technology curve,"" he said.

The minister invited investors to come and invest in oil and gas exploration and production under liberal fiscal policies like pricing and marketing freedom and minimal government interference in management of contracts.

""The government has consciously tried to reduce administrative and regulatory roadblocks and to infuse new technologies,"" he said. ""Going forward, the government remains committed for making sustained and significant efforts to liberalise the sector by simplifying processes, increasing market access and bringing developments in the technology domain with the aim to enhance the efficiency of our oil and gas industry.""

He went on to state that there has never been a better time to invest in India's E&P given the ample opportunities available.",464,0.9626196026802063

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp, has been shortlisted alongside global giants like Chevron, Shell and Total to bid in Mexico's latest round of oil and gas field auction.

Mexico is offering 15 shallow-water exploration blocks in the second round of hydrocarbon auction, called round 2.1. These blocks cover a combined area of 8,908 sq km and hold prospective resources of 4 billion barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas.

Mexico's upstream regulator CNH had prequalified 36 bidders for round 2.1, industry sources said.

Of these, 20 have been selected to participate individually. These include OVL and other global giants like Chevron, CNOOC of China, ConocoPhillips, Ecopetrol, Italy's ENI, Lukoil of Russia, Repsol of Spain, Shell, and Total of France.

The other 16 shortlisted to bid in consortiums.

Sources said while most energy majors have been paired with smaller companies, OVL will be bidding alone in the auction.

Of the blocks on auction, four are the largest: block five with 466 million barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas (boe), block 11 with 426 million boe, block four with 403.9 million boe and block 12 with 409 million boe.

In 2015, OVL was among the 19 companies and seven groups that was pre-qualified to bid for Mexico's maiden offshore oil blocks auction. It was however unsuccessful in getting any block.

The pre-qualification criteria specified knowledge and experience in working in at least three shallow waters exploration and production of oil and gas or in one or two large-scale projects, which together involve capital investments of USD 1 billion.

According to the bid criteria, companies will have an initial exploration period of four years with the possibility of a two-year extension. They also have to drill at least one well after winning the block.

OVL has stake in 38 projects in 17 countries including Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Iraq, Syria, Libya, South Sudan, Sudan, Mozambique, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam and New Zealand.

It contributes to 14.5 per cent and 8 per cent of oil and natural gas production of India, respectively. In terms of reserves and production, it is the second largest petroleum company of India, next only to its parent ONGC.",412,-0.9998207688331604

Having stood by Iran in its tough times, India expects Tehran to reciprocate by awarding rights of the coveted Farzad-B gas field to its discoverer, ONGC, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.

Upset with the USD 5.5 billion master development plan submitted by ONGC Videsh Ltd - the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - Iran has signed an initial pact with Russia's Gazprom for developing Farzad-B gas field.

""We value relationships. During difficult days of Iran, when the entire west imposed sanctions, we stood by them and bought substantial amount of crude oil. We also returned every penny when the banking channels reopened,"" he said.

Now, Iran has to reciprocate. ""We have that much expectation from Iran. I hope Iran will comply with that,"" he said. ""Our relationship with Iran is not based on a single commodity or a single transaction.""

With Tehran delaying the award of rights to develop the 12.5 trillion cubic feet gas field to its discoverer, OVL, India decided to cut oil imports from Iran by a fifth in 2017 -18.

Iran retaliated by first cutting by one-third the time it gave to Indian refiners to pay for oil they buy from it as also raising ship freight rates, and now by signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Russian gas monopoly Gazprom.

The MoU was signed between Gazprom and National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) in Kremlin on March 28 when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani met his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. The agreement spans Farzad-B, the North Pars and Kish fields.

Iran has been unhappy with the USD 5.5 billion investment plan of OVL as it will have to reimburse all of the money that is invested, together with a fixed rate of return. Tehran wants the investment to be lowered and OVL commit to buying gas at a price fixed by it.

OVL, on the other hand, says it will take up development only if the terms are economical and cannot absorb any cost and the price of gas should be comparable to rates in current market.

Sources said Indian refiners have cut oil imports from Iran by a fifth to 1,90,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017-18 from 2,40,000 bpd in the previous fiscal.

Iran, India's third biggest oil supplier, used to give a 90-day credit period to refiners like Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) to pay for the oil they would buy from it.

Now, Tehran has reduced this to 60 days, essentially meaning that IOC and MRPL would have to pay for the oil they buy from Iran in 60 days instead of previous liberal term of 90 days, they said.

Iran oil sale terms were the most attractive for Indian refiners. Besides a liberal credit period, it also shipped the oil to India for a nominal 20 per cent of normal ocean freight.

Other Middle-East sellers offer not more than 15-day credit period.

Sources said NIOC has also decided to cut the discount it offers to Indian buyers on freight from 80 per cent to about 60 per cent.

Since the lifting of western sanctions, Iran has played hardball over award of the field which was discovered by OVL.

The two nations were initially targeting concluding a deal on Farzad-B field development by November 2016 but later mutually agreed to push the timeline to February 2017.

Now, the deal is being targeted to be wrapped up by September after the two sides agree on a price and a rate of return for OVL's investments.

Farzad B was discovered by OVL in the Farsi block about 10 years ago. The project has so far cost the OVL-led consortium, which also includes Oil India Ltd and Indian Oil Corp (IOC), over USD 80 million.

The field in the Farsi block has an in-place gas reserve of 21.7 tcf, of which 12.5 tcf are recoverable.

State-owned Pawan Hans is looking at operating sea plane services, maintenance and repair of helicopters and skill development to go beyond its bread-and-butter business of helicopter services, according to officials familiar with the development. The company is also talking to at least five state governments including the Yogi Adityanath dispensation in Uttar Pradesh to form joint ventures to cater to the local needs for tourism and other purposes.

One of the officials said the company’s gameplan included grabbing opportunities thrown up by the government’s regional connectivity scheme.

Pawan Hans is a 51:49 joint venture between the government of India and state-owned explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.

The official said the company was looking to operate small planes that have a seating capacity of 15-20 including ones that can land on sea. “We are looking to operate 15-20 seater planes. We are also looking to fly sea planes with capacity of 6-10 seats and 18-20,” he said. Another area that Pawan Hans is eyeing is skill development for flying helicopters.

Though not strictly comparable, helicopters are more expensive to operate with their cost of operations being at least four times more than the cost of flying a plane.

“There is a huge shortage of pilots for flying helicopters. Most of the helicopter pilots are retired personnel from Indian Air Force. Some are trained at Hindustan Aeronautics’ Bengaluru centre while some others undergo training in Canada. But there is a genuine shortage of these pilots. We want to fill that gap,” he said, adding the company had set up a centre at Rohini in Delhi to train aspirants to become helicopter pilots.

The company also wants to get into maintenance and repair as the popularity of helicopter services increases and hence the demand for their upkeep.

Pawan Hans is also exploring the possibility of forming joint ventures with state governments to facilitate tourist mobility to and from destinations like Char Dham and Buddha Circuit. One state government the company is talking to is Uttar Pradesh’s Yogi Adityanath regime. According to the other official, the state was even willing to provide a top-up subsidy beyond the subsidy being given by the Centre under its regional connectivity scheme.

“The UP government is willing to give under-writing on 30 percent of the seats beyond the mandated 50 percent,” this official said.

Under the regional connectivity scheme, the government auctions selected unserved and under-served routes with the award going to the company that asks for the lowest viability gap funding. The winner gets a 3-year exclusive right to operate flights on the route. Fare for half the seats in a flight is capped at Rs 2,500 for an hour of a flight journey of approximately 500 km and a 30-minute helicopter journey.

The selected airline provides 50 percent of the flight capacity – with a minimum of 9 and maximum of 40 seats for planes and a minimum of 5 and maximum of 13 seats for helicopters -- under the regional connectivity scheme. The government plans to hold the second round of auctions in two months.

Pawan Hans is a disinvestment candidate with the government keen to its sell 51 percent stake in the company to a strategic buyer including ONGC if it is interested.

As against the expectation of a merger between the public sector companies ONGC and HPCL, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has sought cabinet approval for Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to buy out government’s entire stake in the Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL).

Reacting to the news, ONGC was trading today 0.55 percent higher while HPCL traded 0.91 percent lower.

The 51.11 percent holding of government in HPCL is expected to fetch around Rs 28,000 crore for the government. The merger prima facie is a win-win for all the major stake holders.

The government cashes in on its holding of HPCL, while continuing to hold it indirectly through ONGC where it has a 68.07 percent stake. ONGC and HPCL both benefit on account of the merger through synergies and a stronger balance sheet.

In a report on the possible merger, Edelweiss pointed out that there are limited immediate cost synergies, but the combined entity will enjoy lower earnings volatility across oil price cycles. Globally integrated players have enjoyed higher returns and stable valuations across oil price cycles as compared to pure refiners or pure oil exploration and production companies.

ONGC has a strong balance sheet and can easily absorb HPCL. According to Edelweiss, the deal value is equivalent to 4 years of ONGC’s free cash flow. And based on ONGC’s stake in HPCL’s operating cash flow, the reasonable payback period is five years.

Looking at these numbers, ONGC has got a very good deal as under no condition would it have been possible to have a 25 million tonne refinery of the size of HPCL with its 14,500 petrol pumps.

So, if everything seems so good why did share prices of ONGC and HPCL not react to this news?

The government in its budget had announced that they were keen on creating a large integrated oil company, in line with some of the global majors. But, since the news HPCL has not moved higher despite broader markets touching new highs. ONGC, on the other hand, has fallen since the budget.

The reason is in the details.

Oil exploration and refining is a higher Return on Equity (RoE) business as compared to refining. ONGC will thus be utilizing its cash and piling more debt in acquiring a company which delivers lower RoE.

What is critical for ONGC and the country is to acquire oil assets both in India and abroad. Apparently, the news of a possible buyout of government’s stake in HPCL by ONGC came on the same day when Iran decided to give Russia the development rights of Farzad B gas fields, which was discovered by a consortium of Indian-run companies.

Iran, it seems was unhappy with the amount ONGC was willing to invest in the gas field. The move was also considered to counter India’s decision to cut down oil imports from Iran. In such circumstances, it is more important for India and ONGC to secure and acquire its energy assets rather than meet government's divestment target through such forced acquisition.

Analysts have argued that the merged entity will be able to acquire stakes in bigger oil assets. But Indian companies, both in the private and public space, through various international acquisitions have shown that they are capable of acquiring assets by jointly bidding for the same. Merging the companies to create a bigger balance sheet does not hold water.

Another line of thought is why invest in an energy source when renewables are fast changing the world. Renewables installed capacity in India is 57 GW on a total power installed capacity of over 300 GW, but their feasibility - to a large extent - still dependent on government incentives. Stress is already visible across the value chain in the renewables space.

Further, oil apart from being used as a fuel also has multiple applications as a feedstock for petrochemical industry. Oil still has a long way to go before it can be completely substituted.

Thus, as far as ONGC’s investment in HPCL is concerned, though the move seems good on account of synergistic benefits, the company would be spending resources in trying to integrate at a time when it should be acquiring oil assets, which is its main line of activity.

As oil prices are low and oil producing countries are in stress, this would have been a good time to acquire assets.",742,0.7351079848077562

The oil ministry has formed all- powerful review committees to monitor performance of ONGC and Oil India, and will have power to relinquish any oil and gas field for auctioning to private firms.

Being dubbed as 'super-boards', the committees will be headed by the ministry's upstream nodal authority DGH, and will review and monitor performance of areas given to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) on nomination basis.

The two panels - one each for ONGC and OIL, will review from annual work programme and budget to declaration of a discovery as commercial as also reservoir and production performance, monitoring of development activities and collaborations with other explorers.

""The advice/decision of the Review Committee shall be implemented forthwith by the NOC (national oil company) concerned and the progress of implementation shall be reported to the Review Committee through DGH at its next meeting,"" the May 25 order issued by Atanu Chakraborty, Director General, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), said.

The order follows ministry's unhappiness with state explorers particularly on delays in projects linked to output enhancement. It has already ordered a detailed review of board of directors of ONGC for a possible revamp of the functional heads.

""They have all the powers to do so. We have to live with it,"" said a senior official at one of the two explorers. ""If they want to create a 'super-board' so be it,"" he said.

The panels will be headed by DG, DGH and will have two other members from DGH - one Deputy DG and another head of Division in charge of NOCs-monitoring. One representative of ONGC or OIL not below the rank of director will be nominated by the NOCs.

Also, the manager of the asset that is under review would be co-opted as member of the committee, the order said.

ONGC produced 86 per cent of its 26.13 million tonnes of crude oil in 2016-17 fiscal from fields given to it on nomination basis. Natural gas production from nomination fields accounted for 93 per cent of the total output of 25.34 billion cubic meters.

In the order for 'Constitution of Review Committees for Management of Oil and Gas Resources of Nomination Fields of National Oil Companies (NOCs)', Chakraborty said the panels are being constituted drawing from powers given to DGH by the oil ministry orders.

The order for the constitution of the committees will ""come into force with immediate effect,"" he said.

The review committee will meet at least once every three months.

The powers of the panels include ""annual work programmes and budgets in respect of exploration operations and any modification and revisions thereto"" and ""annual work programme and budgets in respect of development and production operations and any modifications and revisions thereto.""

It will also review ""proposals for surrender or relinquishment of any part of the area included in the nomination field"".

Fields relinquished by NOCs are auctioned to private firms by the government. The first such auction was concluded last fiscal with 67 of fields relinquished by ONGC/OIL being put on sale.

""Performance of non-producing/sub-optimally producing"" fields as well as ""reservoir and production performance of producing fields"" would also be reviewed by the panels, the order said.

Field development plans (FDP), feasibility reports of commercial discoveries in nomination fields and monitoring of development activities for early monetisation will also fall within the ambit of the committees.

""Proposals for 'field surveillance' by DGH for better reservoir management"" will also be under preview of the committees, the orders said, adding collaboration with licensees or contractors of other areas would as reviewed by them.

Also, proposals for an appraisal programme or revision, declaration of a discovery as commercial discovery along with proposed development area will be function of the panels.",669,

Edelweiss' research report on ONGC

ONGC’s Q4FY17 adjusted EBITDAX of INR 111bn (up 76% YoY, 7% QoQ) came exactly in line with estimate. Large one‐offs amounting to INR 44bn on account of state royalty settlement and higher employee provisions impacted performance—PAT at INR 43bn, 22% below estimate. While production disappointed (crude/gas: 4%/2% below), realisation surpassed estimate (crude/gas: 1%/4% ahead).

Outlook

However, depressed APM gas price is challenging viability of core fields (INR 30bn PAT impact in FY17). Rising gas production along with likely higher oil and gas prices portend brighter prospects from FY18. Maintain ‘BUY’ with TP of INR 212.

Contributing 70 percent to the country's crude output, ONGC and Oil India are crucial to India's oil production. Now, the government wants to make these state-owned companies more accountable and boost production by setting up panels headed by bureaucrats to supervise their workings.

The Oil Ministry’s technical arm has ordered that review committees be created ""for the purpose of management of oil and gas resources of nomination fields,"" according to a report in The Economic Times.

A May 25 order stipulates that each committee will be chaired by the Director General of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons and include one more DGH official and top executives of the oil company.

The panel will be empowered to review everything from work programmes to budgets for exploration and performance of oil fields.

It will also review collaboration with licensees or contractors of other areas.

ONGC and Oil India have been directed to implement the committee’s decisions and update on the progress of implementation.

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan recently admitted that there wasn’t much scrutiny of ONGC and Oil India fields, something which he planned to change.

The decision to step up supervision comes at a time when the country is battling limited domestic production capacity. ONGC and Oil India have been unable to stop the slide in domestic production.

The state-run ONGC has seen reversal in onshore domestic crude oil production as it increased to 5.97 MMT during the fiscal year ended March from 5.82 MMT in FY16, logging a growth of 2.4 per cent due to early monetisation of discoveries at Ankleshwar, Cauvery (Madnam) and Rajahmundry (Keshnapalli West), among others.

ONGC Chairman and Managing Director D K Sarraf today also said that the last fiscal year has been ""excellent"" one as the company had as many as 23 new discoveries compared to 17 in 2015-16.

""Around 60 per cent of the discoveries have been monetised in the same year,"" Sarraf told reporters here. Of the 23 new discoveries made in last fiscal, 13 discoveries were in the onshore wells and 10 in the offshore wells, he said.

The production is expected to jump further to 6.05 MMT during the current year backed by similar monetisation of Ahmedabad (Gamij) and Mehsana besides existing ones in Cauvery (Madnam) and Rajahmundry (Keshnapalli West).

The company drilled its highest-ever number of wells -- 501 -- during FY17, against 392 in FY16 and 401 in FY15.

The Central government's initiative for 'Reassessment of Hydrocarbon Resources (HC)' in Indian sedimentary basins which is being undertaken by ONGC is expected to get complete by end of November this year, Sarraf said.",259,0.9999927282333374

Indian Oil Corp (IOC) has overtaken Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) to become India's most profitable state-owned company.

IOC, which has for decades been India's biggest company by turnover, posted a 70 percent jump in net profit to Rs 19,106.40 crore in the financial year ended March 31, 2017.

This was more than the Rs 17,900 crore net profit ONGC posted in the 2016-17 fiscal, making IOC the most profitable PSU, according to earning statements of the companies.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries retained the crown of being India's most profitable company for the third year in a row, posting a net Rs 29,901 crore in financial year 2016-17.

Tata Consultancy Services, India's largest software services exporter, with a net profit of Rs 26,357 crore was the second most profitable company in the country.

ONGC was long India's most profitable company but lost the crown to private sector Reliance and TCS a couple of years back. It has now been unseated as the most profitable PSU by IOC.

In the previous 2015-16 fiscal, IOC had a net profit of Rs 11,242.23 crore as compared to ONGC's Rs 16,140 crore.

While IOC Chairman B Ashok attributed the profit growth to higher refining margins, inventory gains and operational efficiencies, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf said the company lost Rs 3,000 crore in net profit due to government's natural gas pricing policy that has made the business economically unviable.

The BJP-led government had in October 2014 evolved a new pricing formula using rates prevalent in gas surplus nations like the US, Canada and Russia to determine rates in a net importing country.

Prices have halved to USD 2.48 per million British thermal unit since the formula was implemented.

Sarraf said the company lost Rs 5,010 crore in revenue on natural gas business from 35 percent drop in gas prices in last one year. ""Our profit would have been about Rs 3,000 crore higher if we got remunerative gas price,"" he said.

""Natural gas is no more profitable business because cost of production is very very significantly higher than current gas prices,"" he said.

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha on March 20 had stated that the cost of production of natural gas in the prolific Krishna Godavari basin is between USD 4.99 per mmBtu and USD 7.30 per mmBtu.

The same for other basins is in the range of USD 3.80 per mmBtu to USD 6.59 per mmBtu, he had said, adding the production costs of companies vary from field to field depending upon size of the reservoir, location, logistics and availability of surface facilities.

ONGC is the country's biggest gas producer, accounting for some 80 percent of the 70 million standard cubic meters per day current output.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has said that producing natural gas is no longer a profitable business for the company as the government-mandated gas price is significantly below the cost of production.

The BJP-led government had in October 2014 evolved a new pricing formula using rates prevalent in gas surplus nations like the US, Canada and Russia to determine rates in a net importing country. Prices have halved to USD 2.48 per million British thermal unit since the formula was implemented.

ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf said the company lost Rs 5,010 crore in revenue in the natural gas business, and about Rs 3,000 crore in profit in just the last one year because of cuts in gas prices.

""Natural gas is no more profitable business because cost of production is very very significantly higher than current gas prices,"" he told reporters here.

For any company it does not make economic or commercial sense to invest in new fields or in augmenting production from existing ones through fresh investment if the price it will get is below the cost of production.

Sarraf said the price paid to domestic producers is less than half of the rate paid for import of gas (LNG).

India currently imports half of its natural gas needs and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keen on cutting down import bill by raising indigenous production and 'Make in India'.

ONGC, he said, has sought a review of the natural gas pricing formula.

""We have no reason to disbelieve that gas prices will not be raised,"" he said.

India's largest natural gas producer is demanding a floor or minimum price of natural gas be fixed at USD 4.2 per mmBtu for the business to make economic sense.

""Keeping in view cost of production of gas, cost of alternate fuels and other market dynamics, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is requested to review the existing domestic gas price formula and provide a floor price at least to the level of earlier APM (regulated) price (USD 4.20 per mmBtu)/ non-APM price (USD 4.20 to USD 5.25 per mmBtu) fixed in June 2010,"" ONGC said in a recent communique.

The new formula provides for revising rates every six months - on April 1 and October 1, based on one-year average gas price in the surplus nations with a lag of one quarter.

When the formula was implemented, rates went up from USD 4.2 to USD 5.05 per mmBtu but fell to USD 4.66 per mmBtu in April 2015 and to USD 3.82 in October that year.

It further dipped to USD 3.06 per mmBtu in April 2016 and to USD 2.50 per mmBtu in October 2016. In April this year, it further fell to USD 2.48 per mmBtu.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) today reported a 6.2 per cent drop in March quarter net profit after it cleared royalty dues to Gujarat and Assam and provisioned for employee pay revision.

Net profit in January-March at Rs 4,340 crore was 6.2 per cent lower than Rs 4,625 crore net profit in the same period a year ago.

The drop was despite the companys net price realisation for crude oil produced from nominated fields rising 57 per cent to USD 54.91 a barrel and also from joint venture fields by 68 per cent to USD 48.72 a barrel.

""We set out Rs 2,444 crore to clear royalty payments to Gujarat and Assam as had been ordered by the Supreme Court,"" ONGC Director (Finance) A K Srinivasan said.

The royalty payment was due after the government agreed with the contention of Gujarat and Assam that the state-owned company should pay royalty on gross price for crude and not the net price it realised after paying for fuel subsidises.

Also, the company provisioned Rs 1,944 crore towards ensuing pay revision for employees.

""But for the royalty payments, our net profit would have been higher by Rs 1,600 crore,"" he said.

Revenues were up 33.7 per cent to Rs 21,714 crore in the fourth quarter of 2016-17, a company statement said.

Also, the company lost Rs 4,000 crore in revenue on natural gas price dipping to USD 2.5 per million British thermal unit from USD 3.82 per mmBtu in Q4 of 2015-16 fiscal.

For the full fiscal, the company reported a 10.9 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 17,900 crore on flat revenue of Rs 77,907 crore.

Net realisation on crude oil produced from nominated fields was up 6.6 per cent at USD 50.27 per barrel and that from joint venture fields by 4 per cent at USD 44.09 a barrel.

""ONGC has achieved a phenomenal rise in exploration performance in FY17 by making 23 discoveries, as against 17 discoveries in FY16 ? an increase of 35 per cent. Of the 23 discoveries, 13 discoveries were made in onland and 10 in offshore,"" the statement said.

Out of 13 onland discoveries, nine were monetized during the year itself having a potential of 0.218 million tonnes of oil equivalent per year.

ONGCs crude oil production rose marginally by 0.8 per cent in January-March to 6.39 million tonnes but fell 1.5 per cent in the full year to 25.534 million tonnes.

Gas output was up 13.4 per cent in Q4 to 5.944 billion cubic meters and by 3.3 in full 2016-17 fiscal to 23.27 bcm.

After accounting for revenue and profits of its unlisted subsidiaries ONGC Videsh Ltd and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, ONGC had a consolidated net profit of Rs 20,498 crore in 2016-17, up 59.2 per cent from Rs 12,875 crore of previous year.

ONGC Videsh Ltd today reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 701 crore for the fiscal ended March 31, helped by a rise in oil and gas production.

OVL had posted a net loss of Rs 3,633 crore in the previous fiscal.

The company is unlisted overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and by law is not required to provide quarterly earning numbers.

Crude oil production from OVL's properties abroad rose 53 percent to 8.434 million tonnes in 2016-17 from 5.51 million tonnes in the previous year. Natural gas output was up 28.27 percent to 4.37 billion cubic meters, the company said In a statement.

Consolidated turnover was 2.15 percent higher at Rs 10,080 crore in the 2016-17 fiscal.

""The incremental production is mainly due to acquisition of 26 percent stake in Vankorneft project in Russia during the year,"" it said.

OVL completed acquisition of 15 percent interest in Vankor field located in East Siberia on May 31, 2016 from Rosneft Oil Company and subsequently acquired additional 11 percent interest on October 28, 2016.

Vankor is Russia's second largest field by production and accounts for 4 percent of Russian production. The daily output from the field is around 400,000 barrels per day of crude oil (BOPD) on an average and OVL's share of daily oil production from Vankor is about 104,000 BOPD.

For the Vankor acquisition, OVL raised USD 1 billion through an overseas bonds issue for refinancing the bridge loan taken for buying the 15 percent stake in JSC Vankorneft.

It also raised finances by way of bridge loan to acquire 11 percent in Vankor in October 2016.

""The bridge loans have been replaced in April 2017 for which the company tied up USD 500 million and JPY 38 billion syndicated longer tenor facilities at competitive prices from international commercial banks,"" the statement added.",320,0.5904350996017456

India's crude oil production fell 0.6 per cent to 2.93 million tonnes in April after Cairn India shut some 70-odd wells at its biggest oilfield in prolific Rajasthan block.

Crude oil production stood at 2.95 million tonnes in the same month last year, according to a statement by Petroleum Ministry today.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) output was up 2.5 per cent to 1.84 million tonnes but lower production by private sector firms dragged down the overall production.

Private/ joint venture fields produced 8.44 per cent less crude oil at 818,450 tonnes mainly because 70 wells on Mangala field of Cairn were shutdown for workover. Also, ""few high water cut wells"" were closed at Mangala while the reservoir at Bhagyam - the second biggest field in Rajasthan block, performed poor, the ministry statement said.

Natural gas production was 1.8 per cent higher at 2,532.73 million standard cubic meters (mmscm) after output at ONGC fields rose 9.7 per cent to 1,790.07 mmscm.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp, is targeting over 14 per cent jump in output to 14.37 million tonne (MT) in the current fiscal, with its fields in Russia contributing half of the total.

Talking to reporters on the sidelines of an industry event, OVL Managing Director Narendra K Verma said OVL had in 2016-17 produced 12.57 MT crude oil and equivalent natural gas from its assets abroad.

OVL output was 8.92 MT oil and oil equivalent gas in the previous 2015-16 fiscal.

""In the current year we are targeting 14.37 million tons oil equivalent production,"" he said.

OVL Director (Finance) Vivekanand said half of the current year's production would come from Russia's Vankor oilfield in which the company last year acquired 26 per cent stake.

OVL bought the stake in two tranches. First, it acquired 15 per cent in May 2016 for USD 1.268 billion, and then another 11 per cent in October 2016 for USD 930 million.

It received its 15 per cent share of oil from Vankor for the almost 11 months but 11 per cent share was only for a part of year as the deal.

This fiscal, it will get full 26 per cent share.

OVL's share of oil from Vankor will be 7.3 MT.

Vivekanand said the company has started getting dues from Venezuela, with almost USD 80 million being paid over the last 3-4 months.

Venezuela owed OVL around USD 530 million in unpaid dividends and has this year started to clear that in instalments.

""We got about USD 80 million but also had to invest USD 40 million back. So net we have got USD 40 million,"" he said.

OVL had in April 2008 acquired 40 per cent stake in San Cristobal oil project in Venezuela. Corporacion Venezolana del Petróleo (CVP), a unit of state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), owns the remaining stake.

With an investment of USD 408.35 million, OVL's share of crude oil production from the 160.18 km acreage in the Orinoco Heavy Oil belt was 0.645 MT in 2014-15.

OVL received USD 56.224 million as dividend on profit made by CVP in 2008 but dividends from 2009 totalling to about USD 530 million remained unpaid due to cash flow difficulties being faced by PDVSA/CVP.

OVL has 37 projects in 17 countries. Of these, 14 assets in 10 countries are producing and four in a similar number of countries are under development.",453,-0.006956905126571655

Motilal Oswal's research report on ONGC

For a balanced market, demand for OPEC crude oil production is 33.1mnbopd, which is slightly higher than current production of 32.6mnbopd by OPEC. If OPEC and non-OPEC maintain their production cuts in 2HCY17, it would result in a tighter demand-supply, in turn resulting in higher oil prices.

Outlook

Assuming Brent of USD55/60/bbl in FY18/19, we estimate ONGC’s EPS at INR 20.3/22.9. Every USD5/bbl change in oil price causes 10% change in EPS. Valuing the stock at 10x FY19E EPS and adding the value of investments, we arrive at a target price of INR 233 (unchanged). Buy.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp, produced a record 12.57 million tonnes of crude oil and equivalent gas from its assets abroad in 2016-17.

The output was up from 8.92 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in the previous fiscal 2015-16, OVL Managing Director Narendra K Verma said.

In its over five-decade existence, which began in 1965 with a venture in Iran, OVL has seen a peak production of 9.45 million tonnes in 2010-11.

""Production in 2016-17 was higher on account of acquisition of stake in Russia's Vankor oil field,"" Verma told PTI here.

For 2017-18, the company is targeting 14.37 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas production.

This fiscal, it will get full 26 per cent share.

OVL's share of oil from Vankor will be 7.3 million tonnes.

Besides OVL's 26 per cent, a consortium of comprising Oil India (OIL), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat PetroResources (BPRL) has acquired 23.9 per cent stake in the field at a cost of USD 2.02 billion, giving them 6.56 million tonnes of oil.

The daily production from the field is around 410,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 26% stake would give OVL about 107,000 bpd.

OVL has 37 projects in 17 countries. Of this, 14 assets in 10 countries are producing and four in a similar number of countries are under development, he said.

Verma said OVL's next incremental production will come from Columbia where it has made a significant discovery and from Iran where it is negotiating a contract for a gas field it had discovered.

OVL plans to spend USD 1 billion in the current fiscal to drill new wells and add production facilities in fields from Russia to Venezuela.

The company has 633 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas reserves in its assets abroad.

Acquisition of Vankor added 72.58 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas (15 per cent) and 51.96 million tonnes (11 per cent) of reserves to its portfolio.

Though the company had been in existence since 1965, its first production started only in 2002-03. In its first three decades, it did no major acquisition and its first breakthrough came in 1988 when it acquired stake in an oil and gas field in Vietnam. The next acquisition happened only 2001 when it bought 20 per cent stake in Sakhalin-1 project in Russia. There was no looking back thereafter.

It has so far invested USD 27.23 billion in overseas projects, the highest by any Indian company.",539,0.9980635046958923

Motilal Oswal has upgraded state-run ONGC to buy from neutral with a target price of Rs 233 (implying 30 percent upside), citing positive policy developments, cost efficiency and dividend yield of 4-6 percent. The stock rallied more than 2 percent intraday after this upgrade report.

After two years of negative EPS growth, the research firm expects company's EPS growth at 31 percent in FY18 and 14 percent in FY19.

Continued improved oil recovery (IOR) and contribution of new projects to production would also help reverse the decadal trend of negative-to-flat growth, it feels.

ONGC has spent a total of Rs 42,400 crore on improved oil recovery since 2000. In FY16, 29.6 percent of the oil production came from IOR.

The government has been working on incentivising recovery techniques, which may further reduce costs for the company, says the brokerage house.

Better optimisation has resulted in operating expenses coming down from USD 7.4/boe (barrel of oil equivalent) in FY16 to USD 5.9/boe in nine months period ended December 2016.

USD 1/boe change in operating expenses results in 7 percent change in EBITDA and EPS.

Motilal Oswal expects this cost efficiency to sustain going forward.

After meeting with management, the research firm believes gas production would grow at 10-15 percent annually for the next five years and its oil production has also been inching up.

ONGC expects Daman/C26 to add 4.5 mmscmd to production in FY18. S1 and Vashishta gas fields would add 1.5 mmscmd while WO16 would add 1.2 mmscmd in FY18.

Its IOR at the Bassein field is expected to add 3.9 mmscmd in FY19. In the longer run, Cluster-2 at KG DWN-98/2 would add a peak production of around 16 mmscmd.

ONGC has guided that oil production from nominated fields would increase. WO16 would add 3,800 bopd (barrels oil per day) in FY18 while Vasai East is likely to add another 4,800 bopd.

Its Ratna & R-series would add 3,000 bopd in FY19 along with 8,000 bopd from B127 and 5,000 bopd from Assam. Ratna & R-series would peak at 14,700 bopd in FY20 while production from Cluster-2 would commence in FY21, with peak expected at 77,000 bopd.

ONGC has not been bearing any subsidy since Q2FY16. Realisation in nine months period ended December 2016 was USD 48.65 barrel against USD 51.46 per barrel in nine months period ended December 2015.

Subsidy in nine months period ended December 2015 stood at USD 1.52 per barrel.

""We do not expect any subsidy burden to be levied on ONGC as long as oil prices are below USD 65 per barrel. However, realisation may be capped if oil prices rise above USD 65 per barrel,"" says Motilal Oswal which estimated that USD 5 per barrel increase in realisation results in 10 percent increase in EPS.

The brokerage house says there are strong signs that OPEC would extend the ongoing production cut.

Hence, it expects oil prices to remain in the band of USD 50-60 per barrel, which would provide stability to its earnings. With Brent of USD 55/60 per barrel in FY18/19, it expects company's EPS of Rs 20/22.9 in FY18/19.

At 12:57 hours IST, the stock price was quoting at Rs 182.90, up Rs 3.35, or 1.87 percent on the BSE.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) made 23 oil and gas discoveries in the fiscal year ended March 31 as a record number of wells drilled helped it uncover new reserves.

While the International Energy Agency (IEA) stated that global oil discoveries fell to a record low in 2016 as companies continued to cut spending and conventional oil projects sanctioned were at the lowest level in more than 70 years, ONGC stepped up its exploratory efforts to augment new production.

""FY 2016-17 has been one of the most successful years of the last decade in exploring oil and gas with more thrust in increased exploration activities during the year,"" a top company official said.

Its exploratory efforts yielded 23 new discoveries, a 35 percent jump over 17 finds made in 2015-16 fiscal.

Of the 23 new discoveries, 12 are new prospects -- a potential trap which may contain hydrocarbons, while 11 are new pools -- a geological term for subsurface hydrocarbon accumulation.

As many as 13 new discoveries were made in on land and 10 in offshore wells.

""A total of 100 exploratory wells were drilled which is higher by 9 percent as compared to 92 wells drilled in the previous year 2015-16. Of these, 37 wells proved hydrocarbon bearing registering success ratio of 37 percent,"" he said.

IEA in a report today said oil discoveries declined to 2.4 billion barrels in 2016, compared with an average of 9 billion barrels per year over the past 15 years.

Also, the number of projects that received a final investment decision dropped to the lowest level since the 1940s.

""This sharp slowdown in activity in the conventional oil sector was the result of reduced investment spending driven by low oil prices,"" IEA said.

However, ONGC continued to spend more to help achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of reducing import dependence by 10 percent by 2022.

The official said the accretion of in place hydrocarbons was 203.24 million tons of oil and oil equivalent gas and the ultimate reserve accretion was 64.32 million tons.

Reserve Replacement Ratio (RRR) for the year has been 1.49.

The discoveries include two in Kutch and Saurashtra basin, off Gujarat coast.

Also, SRI-1 discovery in the NELP block KG-OSN-2009/2 in KG basin has established huge potential for syn-rift/deeper play in east coast shallow water.

Jabera-4 discovery established hydrocarbons for the first time in Vindhyan Basin and has given impetus for putting Vindhyan basin on hydrocarbon map of India, he said.

The official said ONGC is working on early monetisation of new discoveries. Nine on land discoveries made during the year have been monetised and put on production with average oil rate of 445 cubic meters per day and gas rate of 220,000 cubic meters a day.

The discoveries have cumulatively produced 38,809 tons of oil and 23.78 million standard cubic meters of gas during the year.",491,0.11397080951266819

India's crude oil production went up marginally by 0.9 per cent in March on the back of higher output by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC).

Crude production at 3.09 million tonnes was 0.9 per cent higher than 3.06 mt in March 2016, an official statement said.

ONGC saw output rise to 1.93 mt in March, from 1.86 mt a year ago.

However, at 36 mt, oil production for the all of 2016-17 is 2.5 per cent lower than 36.94 mt a year earlier.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) plans to invest USD 11 billion in exploration which will help it increase gas production by up to 30 percent over the next 3-4 years, an article in the Mint reported today.

Gas production will increase from around 23 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year now to up to 29-30 bcm in four years. The production increase will come after nearly a decade of stagnant output.

The capacity increase will be met by putting some blocks into production, and ramping up others. Blocks in the Krishna Godavari basin (KG-DWN-98/2), and Ratna and R-Series oilfields in Mumbai offshore will be put into production by 2019, while Jharkhand’s coal bed methane will start production by 2020. Daman’s offshore fields which have already started production this month will be ramped up.

This will also offset the production drop expected at some oil fields to 11.8 bcm in four years from the current 19.73 bcm.

A large chunk of the investment will go into developing the KG block, and the company plans to develop KG-DWN-98/2 in three clusters.

ONGC drilled 501 wells last fiscal compared to 386 in 2015-16, a number achieved for the first time in nearly 20 years.

Analysts point out that ONGC’s aggressive stance on discoveries and production comes at an opportune time as the government looks to cut down natural gas imports by 10 percent and it will bode well for the company.

The explorer will also shortly start work on the high-pressure high temperature Deen Dayal West field in which it acquired 80 percent from Gujarat State Petroleum Corp. this February for USD 1.2 billion.",282,0.5002091526985168

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has set a new record of drilling over 500 wells in 2016-17 at an expenditure of Rs 15,747 crore as the major state-owned explorer steps up efforts to boost domestic output.

ONGC drilled 501 wells in the financial year ended March 31, 2017 as compared to 386 wells in 2015-16. This is the first time in 23 years that ONGC has crossed the 500-well mark.

Oil and gas exploration is a risky business and only drilling of wells can guarantee a discovery and confirmation of reserves. The company exceeded the government mandated target of 490 wells. Of the 501 wells drilled, 334 wells were in onshore and the remaining 167 in offshore, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf said here.

""While many explorers worldwide decided to slow down due to the prevailing low price scenario, ONGC had taken the conscious decision to step up the exploration efforts. Despite this challenging environment, the ONGC drilling and well services has put in a commendable performance,"" he said.

Sarraf said several steps were taken during the last financial year to cut down rig deployment time, increase operational efficiencies and cost control. ONGC operates some 105 drilling and 74 work over rigs. It is among the few companies in the world to have drilled 127 deepwater wells in diverse and challenging areas.

The company's Director (T&S) Shashi Shanker said: ""Setting a new benchmark of 501 wells in a year is a phenomenal achievement, especially considering the challenges the oil and gas industry has faced globally during the past two years. ""There is a continuous emphasis in ONGC on induction of state-of- the-art technology, optimum utilisation of resources and minimisation of non-productive time of rigs to increase operational efficiency.""

Offshore, which contributes to 80 per cent of ONGC's 24 million tonne a year crude oil production, exceeded all its drilling targets. Targets were also surpassed in drilling onland where majority of ONGC's owned rig fleet is deployed. He said as drilling activities account for ONGC's major expenditure, an increase in drilling efficiency would translate to additional savings.

In order to have a more focused approach towards onshore, offshore (shallow waters) and offshore (deep waters) operations a new concept 'Company within Company' was rolled out in Mumbai High Asset to bring about operational efficiency in offshore drilling operations.

Drilling of record number of wells has not just led to establishing newer resources but also augment production from the old and depleting fields. But for these drilling oil output would have dropped to 22 MT.",469,0.6058945655822754

State-owned HPCL's long-pending 9 mtpa refinery at Barmer in Rajasthan will go on stream soon, with the state government agreeing to a revised fiscal package for the project, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said today.

""Very soon, work will start on the Rajasthan refinery project. We have finalised the financial assessment,"" he said at the Global Natural Resources Conclave here.

Later talking to reporters, he said fiscal incentives for the project have been revised and a memorandum of understanding (MoU) is likely to be signed in Jaipur later this month.

""The fiscal package negotiated by the previous (Congress) government had put a big burden on Rajasthan. Now, that has been balanced,"" he said.

He did not provide details of the revised fiscal incentives being offered by the Rajasthan government.

""Work on the project will start very soon,"" he added.

The project, which has been in the works for nearly five years now, is projected to cost Rs 41,000-42,000 crore, up from the previous estimate of Rs 37,320 crore.

HPCL, in March 2013, had signed an MoU with the Rajasthan government for setting up the refinery-cum-petrochemical complex in the Thar desert near the oil discoveries made by Cairn India. But the refinery never took off as a change of guard in the state led to the Rajasthan government putting on hold the fiscal incentives for the project.

While the size of the refinery remains the same, the unit will cost more because it now has to be built to produce Euro-VI grade petrol and diesel, officials said.

Engineers India Ltd (EIL) is doing a feasibility study.

The HPCL board, in March 2013, had approved setting up of the complex at a cost of Rs 37,320 crore. Half of the crude oil requirement at the proposed refinery at Barmer was to come from the neighbouring oil fields of Cairn India. The rest was to be imported crude.

At that point, HPCL had asked the state government to extend fiscal benefits like the ones extended by Gujarat and Odisha to new refinery projects to make the Barmer unit viable.

The concessions included 50 per cent exemption in excise duty, waiver of VAT on products sold in Rajasthan and the state government picking a small stake in the project.

Originally, the state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which owns 30 per cent interest in the Barmer oil fields of Cairn India, in 2005 had committed to building the refinery, but later started soft-pedalling the project. In 2012, HPCL entered the fray and proposed to take 51 per cent stake in the same.

ONGC, which originally had the authorisation from the government for processing the Barmer crude at the proposed refinery, willingly made way for HPCL.

Cairn India, which holds 70 per cent interest in the fields, currently produces about 1,60,000 barrels per day oil (8 million tonnes a year) from the Rajasthan fields.

For HPCL, which has only two refineries in Mumbai and Visakhapatnam, the project will help meet fuel demand in the north.",510,0.0005615353584289551

National oil & gas explorer ONGC is planning to invest over USD 3 billion in the Farzad-B natural gas block in Iran, a top company official said.

The proposed investment will be driven through a consortium of state-run oil companies led by its overseas arm ONGC Videsh (OVL). The statement comes amidst media reports that government is threatening to massively reduce crude intake from Iran as Tehran delays clearing the investment plan in the block.

An OVL-led consortium had already submitted a USD 3 billion development plan to Iran to develop an offshore field in Farzad B, which is said to hold 12.5 trillion cubic feet in reserves, which may last for 30 years.

Iran has been delaying New Delhi's proposal after the US-led western nations lifted the economic embargo on Tehran last year opening its doors to more competitive options, which Tehran wants to explore now.

""Last month, we submitted a revised plan to Tehran for the block. We will be able to develop the block within five years if we are given the go-ahead,"" OVL managing director NK Verma told reporters on the sidelines of an industry meeting here.

""We are keen to invest north of USD 3 billion to develop this field,"" he said adding they are awaiting feedback from Tehran now.

It can be noted that New Delhi was one of the few large oil consumers to have continued buying Iranian crude during the global economic sanctions over Tehran's nuclear programme. But since the lifting of the sanctions last year, Iran has sought other investors and there is some uncertainty whether new Delhi would get the Farzad block contract.

Output from Farzad-B could range from 1 billion to 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, Verma said.

On its production target, Verma said the company expects to raise production in fiscal 2018 to 14 million tonne oil equivalent, up from 12 million tonne in fiscal 2017.

He also said the company is planning to invest USD 45 million to produce from gas wells owned by Imperial Energy, which was acquired by OVL in 2008.

As part of its plans to secure energy resources, government has chalked out an investment plan worth USD 20 billion in Iran, which will include developing oil and gas fields apart from setting up petrochemical plants, gas-processing facilities and developing the strategic Chabahar port in Southern Iran.

Earlier this week, media reports said the government would massively reduce its Iranian oil purchases by a fifth over the delay in clearing the investment in the gas field.

For Iran, India is the biggest oil buyer after China. Unhappy with Tehran's delays, the oil ministry has reportedly asked state refiners to cut imports from Iran.

The state-run refiners reportedly told National Iranian Oil Co about their plans to reduce oil imports by a fifth to 1,90,000 bpd from 2,40,000 bpd. Between April 2016 and February 2017, the domestic oil companies more than doubled their intake from Iran at 5,42,400 bpd, compared to 2,25,522 bpd a year earlier.",548,-0.5217469096183777

State-owned ONGC has projected 17 percent rise in its crude oil production and 66 percent in natural gas by March 2022 as it looks to boost domestic output to help achieve the government target of 10 percent reduction in import of these items.

The nation's biggest oil and gas producer has prepared 'Roadmap' for Import Reduction, two years after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a target for reducing oil import dependence by 10 percent, from 77 percent in 2013-14.

ONGC sees crude oil output rising from 22.6 million tonne in 2017-18 to 26.42 million tonne in 2021-22. Gas output is projected to rise from 25.011 billion cubic meters in 2017-18 to 41.536 bcm in 2021-22.

""ONGC management is keen to ensure that the Prime Minister's vision of 10 per cent import reduction is met,"" the company has said in the document that estimates oil and gas supplies from all past discoveries, ongoing development as well as potential projects slated for development.

As on October 1, 2016, ONGC had 577 hydrocarbon discoveries. Most of them were either in production or action had been initiated to monetise them.

Output from the currently producing fields is projected to fall from 18.5 million tonne in current fiscal which began this month to 12.66 million tons in 2021-22. About 5.3 million tonne is expected from fields where investment approval has already been given and another 8.45 million tonne from the fields that are under conceptualisation or investment approval is under process.

For natural gas, the output is projected to drop from 19.73 bcm from current fields to 11.9 bcn in 2021-22. The situation is rescued by fields that are under development or conceptualisation that will give 29.65 bcm in 2021-22.",328,0.3335454265276591

The overseas arm of India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp has submitted a revised plan to develop the giant Farzad B gas block in Iran, including a commitment to spend more than USD 3 billion, a senior executive said on Tuesday.

ONGC Videsh expects to produce between 1 billion and 1.6 billion cubic feet per day of gas in five years from the start of development of the block, N. K. Verma, the company's managing director told Reuters in Mumbai on Tuesday.

India is the second-largest buyer of Iranian crude, and was among the few countries to continue trade with Iran while the country faced Western sanctions over its nuclear programme.

But since the lifting of some of the sanctions last year, Iran has sought other investors and there is some uncertainty whether the Farzad block contract will be awarded to an Indian company. The impasse has led Indian refiners to plan on cutting imports from Iran by a fifth in 2017-18.

Verma also commented that ONGC Videsh expects to raise production during the fiscal year ending in March 2018 to 14 million tonnes oil equivalent, up from 12 million tonnes in the fiscal year of 2017.

The company also plans to invest USD 45 million to produce from gas wells owned by Imperial Energy, which ONGC Videsh acquired in 2008.

Cairn India and Vedanta Ltd have received all regulatory approvals for their merger, except the Reserve Bank of India's nod for issue of preference shares, the two companies said today.

Unlike in 2011, when mining baron Anil Agarwal bought over Cairn India for USD 8.7 billion, no apparent conditions have been set for the approvals by the government.

The approvals include transfer of participating interest of Cairn India in fields like the giant Rajasthan oilfield and Ravva oil and gas fields in Krishna Godavari basin to Vedanta Ltd.

""The company has now received all the required approvals in relation to the Scheme of Arrangement between Vedanta Ltd and Cairn India Ltd, and their respective shareholders and creditors, save and except the approval of RBI for issuance of Redeemable Preference Shares to the non-resident shareholders of Cairn,"" the two companies said in separate but identical statements.

The approvals will accelerate the process of combining the two companies controlled by Agarwal.

The merger will be made effective upon receipt of the RBI approval, the statements said.

In 2011 the government had set stringent conditions for approving Vedanta's takeover of Cairn India. It made Cairn agree to royalties paid by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) on its most important Rajasthan oilfields, being cost recoverable from oil sales.

ONGC owns 30 percent interest in the Rajasthan oilfields but used to pay royalty at the rate of 20 percent of crude oil price realised on all of output including 70 percent share of Cairn.

Also, the government made Cairn withdraw the arbitration against levy of oil development cess on it and made ti agree to pay its share as the second pre-conditions for approval.

This time around no condition was set despite a Rs 20,495 crore tax demand pending against Cairn India for failing to deduct withholding tax on alleged capital gains by its erstwhile promoter Cairn Energy on gains made from an internal group reorganisation in 2006-07.

Sources said the government could have made Vedanta takeover the tax liability following the merger.

The tax department has frozen 9.8 percent remaining stake of Cairn Energy in Cairn India over the alleged capital gains made in 2006-07 internal business reorganisation.

In July last year, Vedanta had sweetened its merger proposal to win over minority shareholders like LIC.

Shareholders of Cairn India will now get one equity share of Vedanta and four redeemable preference shares of face value Rs 10 and coupon 7.5 percent, as against the proposal of one equity share and one preference share earlier.

The two companies announced plans of the merger in June 2016, which would give the metals and mining company Vedanta access to the cash of Cairn India, helping it cut debt.",536,0.2628629406293233

India will soon launch the second round of auction of discovered oil and gas fields of state- owned ONGC and Oil India Ltd, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.

As contracts for 31 small discovered oil and gas fields auctioned in the first bid round in more than six years were signed, he said a nation that is 80 per cent import dependent cannot afford to see its largest lease holder sit idle.

""There has to be accountability (for ONGC),"" he said at the signing ceremony. The government, he said, is also looking at giving incentives for enhanced and improved oil recovery schemes to help reverse the declining trend in output from ageing fields.

""Discovered Small Fields (DSF) round-II is coming soon,"" he said. Also, on cards is production enchancement contract (PEC) for producing fields of ONGC where operations can be outsourced after setting a minimum benchmark output level. State-owned oil firms IOC, BPCL and HPCL cornered a third of the fields whose contracts were signed.

Touted as an auction round that would replicate the shale gas revolution of the US, half of the fields went to new and lesser known entrants like engineering company Megha Engineering & Infrastructure, KEI-RSOS Petroleum, Enquest Drilling and Nippon Power.

These fields, which hold in-place reserves of 62 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas, can cumulatively produce a peak of around 15,000 barrels of oil per day and 2 million standard cubic meters per day of gas, Pradhan said. The peak oil and gas output envisaged is about 2 per cent of India's current oil and gas production.

""It has been estimated that the indicative gross revenue over economic life would be approximately Rs 46,400 crore of which royalty collection and government's revenue share is expected to be around Rs 5,000 crore and Rs 9,300 crore, respectively,"" the minister said.

In all 46 idle fields, which were taken away from state- owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), were put on bidding in DSF-I. 34 of them received bids. Of these, 14 were single bids. All the 26 onland areas had received bids, although 9 had only single bidders.

""We have completed the DSF-I in just under 10 months time from the date it was launched in May last year,"" Pradhan said. The last auction of oil and gas acreage happened in 2009-10.",405,0.9829308390617371

A three-member arbitration panel has started hearing validity of the government's demand of USD 1.55 billion as compensation from Reliance Industries for ""unfairly"" producing ONGC's gas.

The panel, headed by Singapore-based arbitrator Prof Lawrence Boo, had its first hearing on March 3 where the timetable was drawn, sources privy to the development said. RIL will first file its statement of claim, followed by a statement of defence by the government.

This will be followed by rejoinders, counter-rejoinders and oral hearing, sources said, adding that the panel plans to wind up the hearing in a year. The central government has named former Supreme Court judge GS Singhvi as its nominee on the three-member arbitration panel while RIL and its partners BP Plc of the UK and Canada's Niko Resources have named former UK High Court Judge Bernard Eder to the panel. RIL-BP-Niko had slapped an arbitration notice on November 11 last year.

This was against the oil ministry's November 3, 2016 notice to RIL, Niko and UK's BP seeking USD 1.47 billion for producing about 338.332 million British thermal units of gas in the seven years ended March 31, 2016 that had seeped or migrated from the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC) blocks into their adjoining KG-D6 in the Bay of Bengal.

After deducting USD 71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and adding an interest at the rate of Libor plus 2 per cent, totalling USD 149.86 million, a total demand of USD 1.55 billion was made on RIL, BP and Niko. RIL is the operator of the KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest while BP holds 30 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent is with Niko Resources.

The government's compensation claim flowed from the report of the Justice (retd) A P Shah Committee. The Shah panel, in its August 28, 2016, report, concluded that there has been ""unjust enrichment"" to the contractor of the block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) due to production of the migrated gas from ONGC's blocks KG-DWN-98/2 and Godavari PML.

The government, sources said, accepted the recommendations of the committee and consequently, decided to claim restitution from RIL-BP-Niko for ""the unjust benefit received and unfairly retained"". So, a notice was sent, they said, adding that the government is also pressing RIL to pay USD 174.9 million of additional profit petroleum after certain costs were disallowed because of KG-D6 output being lower than the target.

The cost recovery issue is being arbitrated separately. Originally, ONGC had sued RIL for producing gas that had migrated from its blocks KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5) and Godavari PML in the KG basin to adjoining KG-D6 block of RIL. Under direction of the Delhi High Court, the government had appointed a one-man committee under retired Justice A P Shah to go into the issue. Shah, however, said the compensation should go to the government as it is the owner of all unproduced natural resources.

Coal India, ONGC and Indian Oil Corporation emerged as star financial performers among India's central public sector enterprises in 2015-16, whereas SAIL, BSNL and Air India incurred most losses, a government survey has showed.

The Public Enterprises Survey, tracking the performance of CPSEs in 2015-16, revealed that the top three loss-making CPSEs -- SAIL, BSNL and Air India -- incurred a loss equal to 51.65 per cent of the total loss made by the top 10 loss-making CPSEs in 2015-16.

SAIL entered the list of top 10 loss-making CPSEs, apart from ONGC Videsh, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam, PEC and BHEL. Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, STCL, Fertilizers and Chemicals (Travancore), Air India Engineering Services and Hindustan Fertilisers Corporation went to the profit zone in 2015-16.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has signed definitive agreements to buy out debt-ridden GSPC’s entire 80 per cent stake in KG-basin natural gas block for USD 1.2 billion.

""Subsequent to board approving the deal on February 23, we have now signed farm-in and farm-out agreements,"" a senior company official said.

The company will close the deal and pay the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) the money after regulatory approvals like government nod for transfer of PI (participating interest) and change of operatorship are secured.

""We are hopeful that the deal will be closed in April,"" he said.

ONGC will pay USD 995.26 million for three discoveries in the KG-OSN-2001/3 block that are under trial production since August 2014. Another USD 200 million will be paid for six other discoveries for which GSPC has been finalising an investment plan to bring them to production.

Jubilant Offshore Drilling Pvt Ltd and Geo Global Resources (India) Inc hold 10 percent stake in the block.

Originally, GSPC had offered ONGC its 50 percent stake in the block together with operatorship, but the state-owned firm was not interested. Subsequently, GSPC offered its entire 80 percent stake in the block and ONGC on December 23 last year agreed to acquire the same for USD 1.2 billion.

Two months later, the board approved the acquisition.

Besides the payout to GSPC, ONGC will have to pay for the entire development cost of the six discoveries, which may run into at least a couple of billion dollars.

GSPC, with a debt of Rs 19,716.27 crore as on March 31, 2015, has so far made 9 gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal block. Of these, three -- KG-08, KG-17, KG-15 commonly known as Deendayal West (DDW) fields - have been approved for development.

But against an approved field development plan (FDP) cost of USD 2.75 billion, GSPC has seen a huge cost overrun, incurring USD 2.83 billion as on March 31, 2015. Additionally, it had run up an exploration cost of USD 584.63 million, taking total expenditure as on March 31, 2015, to USD 3.41 billion.

As per the requirement of the field development plan (FDP), 12 more development wells are yet to be completed, which will further bump up the project cost.

The trial production from the DDW field commenced in August 2014, but the average production achieved is only 19.45 million standard cubic feet per day against a targeted commercial production of 200 mmscfd.

Commercial production has not commenced as the rate has not yet stabilised. The DGH-approved FDP had envisaged commercial production from December 2011.

The official said FDP for the six remaining discoveries -- KG-16, KG-22, KG-31, KG-21, KG-19 and KG-20SS -- is under review of GSPC.

As per the approved FDP of DDW fields, the estimated oil and gas in place (OGIP) was 1.95 trillion cubic feet (tcf).",486,0.8733446598052979

State-owned ONGC will invest over Rs 21,500 crore to develop India's deepest gas discovery by 2022-23, helping it more than double output from its prime KG basin block.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which had last year firmed up an investment of Rs 34,012 crore (USD 5.076.37 billion) in bringing to production 10 oil and gas discoveries in its Bay of Bengal block KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5), plans to invest another Rs 21,528.10 crore (USD 3.2 billion) in developing the ultra-deepsea UD-1 find.

""We have submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons a declaration of commerciaility (DoC) for the UD-1 find. We will submit a final investment plan, called the field development plan, by end-2017 and hope to bring the discovery to production by 2022-23,"" ONGC Director (Offshore) Tapas Kumar Sengupta told PTI.

ONGC plans to drill nine wells on the discovery that lies in water depths of 2,400-3,200 metres and will produce a peak output of 19 million standard cubic metres per day.

The company had previously decided to develop other discoveries in KG-D5 block and leave the UD-1 find in the same block for a later date as it thought there was no technology available to produce gas from such water depths.

Sengupta said that there are consultants who have showed to ONGC that discoveries deeper than UD-1 have been put to production in recent times, particularly in Gulf of Mexico.

""A recent expression of interest (EoI) meeting we had for developing the KG finds saw several consultants offering solutions for such water depths,"" he said.

ONGC is in the process of appointing a consultant who will assist in developing the UD-1 discovery.

The 7,294.6 sq km deepsea KG-D5 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries' flagging KG-D6 fields, has been broadly categorised into Northern Discovery Area (NDA - 3,800.6 sq km) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA - 3,494 sq km).

The NDA has 11 oil and gas discoveries while SDA has the nation's only ultra-deepsea gas find of UD-1. These finds have been clubbed into three groups - Cluster-1, Cluster-II and Cluster-III.

Last year, the company finalised a USD 5.07 billion plan for developing the Cluster-II finds by 2019-20. First gas production is envisaged by June 2019 and oil would start flowing from March 2020, he said.

From Cluster-II, a peak oil output of 77,305 barrels per day is envisaged within two years of start of production. Gas output is slated to peak to 16.56 million standard cubic metres per day by end-2021.

Sengupta also said that Culster-1 field will be developed at an additional investment of Rs 4,259.59 crore and will produce about 3 mmscmd of gas.

Cluster-2A mainly comprises oil finds of A2, P1, M3, M1 and G-2-2 in NDA which can produce 77,305 bpd (3.86 million tonnes per annum) and 3.81 mmscmd of gas.

Cluster 2B, which is made up of four gas finds -- R1, U3, U1, and A1 in NDA -- envisages a peak output of 12.75 mmscmd of gas.

State-owned oil major ONGC has said the preliminary discussion for its acquisition of India's third-biggest fuel retailer HPCL has started and is going on at the ministerial level.

""The talks are going on at ministerial level. We have not discussed it at the ONGC board. The petroleum ministry wants this to happen because if integration takes place, there will be value creation,"" ONGC Director (onshore) Ved Prakash Mahawar told PTI here.

Asked about reports on valuation of the deal between ONGC and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), he said: ""These are only guesses. So far, no discussion has taken place at our board meeting.""

Mahawar stressed that merger and acquisitions are strategic decisions of the company and the talks for acquiring HPCL are at a preliminary stage at present.

Asked specifically if any proposal has been prepared to discuss the issue by the ONGC Board, he said: ""We have not talked about it yet.""

According to Mahawar, the government wants that ONGC and HPCL should merge as this will give value to the shareholders.

""We have MRPL (Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd), which does not have retail outlets. If we do a vertical integration of HPCL, then we will take MRPL's products to retail outlets. We will get the margin of retail outlets as well which we are not getting now,"" the director said.

Last month, a source had said India's biggest oil and gas producer ONGC may buy all of the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL, which will have to be followed by an open offer to acquire additional 26 per cent from other shareholders of the retailer.

HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.

ONGC already is majority owner of MRPL, which has a 15 million tonne refinery.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) may well be looking at a cash outgo of at least Rs 44,000 crore if the government asks the oil and gas explorer to acquire stake in oil refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL).

The cash outgo will go towards acquiring the government holding as well as buying an additional 26 percent stake in HPCL via an open offer.HPCL has an equity base of 1.01 billion shares.

At today’s closing price of Rs 561.10 on the National Stock Exchange, its market capitalisation comes to roughly Rs 56,671 crore. While the government will get Rs 29,134 crore for selling its 51.11 percent stake, ONGC will have to cough up another Rs 14,813 crores for another 26 percent share.

Financially, it should not be a difficult exercise for ONGC to service since it sits on reserves of Rs 1,47,574 crore as on March 31, 2016, as per its annual report for the financial year.

On Monday, the Economic Times reported that the government would soon move a Cabinet note for ONGC to take control of HPCL, paving the way for creation of a state-owned oil behemoth.

The challenges to the gigantic exercise will be more administrative and legal than financial. Both ONGC and HPCL were formed by Acts of Parliament and the stake sale will thus need Parliamentary approval, a not-so-easy exercise in an opposition-dominated Upper House.

In his Budget speech for 2017-18 on February 1, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the government proposed ""to create an integrated public sector ‘oil major’ which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies.""

Examples of such oil and gas behemoths abound. Saudi Arabia's Aramco and Norway's Statoil are among those.

""We see opportunities to strengthen our CPSEs through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions. By these methods, the CPSEs can be integrated across the value chain of an industry. It will give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders. Possibilities of such restructuring are visible in the oil and gas sector,"" Jaitley said in his Budget speech.

The government has so far followed a policy that kept oil and gas exploration companies as separate entities from their refining and marketing counterparts. While Oil India and ONGC explore in India and abroad for oil and gas assets (ONGC overseas through its subsidiary ONGC Videsh), refining and marketing operations are undertaken by Indian Oil Corp Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd and GAIL India Ltd. ONGC subsidiary Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd has refining operations.",450,0.9999997615814209

The Cabinet on Wednesday gave an in-principle nod to Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to buy out government’s 51.1% stake in Hindustan Petroleum Ltd (HPCL).

Reports peg the deal at Rs 29,000 crore and the company will also have to pay an additional Rs 15,000 crore to buy shares from the market, according to the takeover code. The government is, however, trying to avoid a situation which triggers takeover code.

Also, the government has smartly used the opportunity to raise money and meet its divestment target. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had set a divestment target of Rs 72,500 crore for FY18.

ONGC has around Rs 25,000 crore in cash and has a leverage of 0.30 thus putting it in a comfortable position to raise the money for the acquisition. For HPCL the price will find a support at the acquisition price level, at least till the time that the open offer is on.

Jaitley, in his Budget speech, had spoken of creating ‘oil majors’ which would be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies.

There is no doubt that an integrated oil company, extending from oil exploration and production to refining adds more value than a standalone refining and marketing company or a standalone oil exploration company.

An integrated entity is able to cushion the volatility of the crude oil market far better than a standalone company. Capturing the entire value chain from oil to fuel smoothens the earnings of the company.

Combining its 15 million tonnes in Mangalore Refineries & Petrochemicals Ltd with the 23.8-million-tonnes HPCL would make ONGC the third largest refiner in the country. ONGC produces around 26 million tonnes of oil and 22.5 billion cubic meters of gas.

All global-sized oil companies are integrated players. Generally fuel and petrochemical feedstock prices move with a lag to the crude oil price thus the loss from a drop in oil revenues can be delayed by higher prices of the finished products.

With oil prices likely to remain low given a slowdown in the global economy and excess supply, a merger with HPCL would give ONGC much-needed growth. Similarly, for HPCL it would need to lock its oil supply as it goes on an expansion spree.

The merger, however, does not mean that HPCL will consume ONGC’s production. Each refinery is designed on a range of crude oil from various oil wells across the globe. A refinery selects its oil depending on the complexity of the refinery and the products that it plans to produce. There does not seem to be any major operational benefit from the merger.

The biggest advantage from the merger will be a stronger balance sheet. Both the companies would need this to bid for larger-sized oil wells. The bigger oil fields that are up for grabs globally are often beyond ONGC’s reach.

With few oil finds in India and the huge requirement for oil in the country, the government intends to secure oil assets globally to prevent the country from any oil shocks in future.

While the intentions are noble, the government will have to ensure that the merged entities are given enough freedom to take quick decisions on acquisitions and bureaucratic hurdles do not result in lost chances as was the case in the past.",564,0.02439303199450175

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had expressed views similar to Surana in a post-Budget interview when he said it “wouldn't be wise to put all eggs in one basket” and there would be 'multi’ oil PSUs.

Surana noted the concept of integration is not new to the oil industry and was expected for some time.

The report, however, does not quantify its proejction.

In 2016, auto sales grew 9.2 percent driven by two- wheelers that moved up by 9.6 percent from 0.7 percent in 2015. At the same time, cars clipped at 7 percent and commercial vehicles grew 7.8 percent.

Key things to watch out for would be net interest margin, asset under management and asset quality.

Analysts say if net interest margin comes above 3.75 percent (against 3.8 percent in Q2), asset under management at 15 percent and gross non-performing assets below 0.85 percent (against 0.75 percent in Q2) then that will be positive.

However, Wockhardt Chief Habil Khorakiwala says that Indian generic companies as a whole belong to a competitive industry in the US and therefore there is no scope for government intervention there.

What Trump is saying implies to generic companies that have a single source of supply, he said.

""OVL and Petroleos De Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) through their relevant subsidiaries signed two definitive agreements for facilitating redevelopment of the San Cristobal joint venture project in Venezuela,"" the company said in a statement.

OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned ONGC, owns 40 per cent of Venezuela's San Cristobal oilfield and had invested about USD 190 million in the project in 2008. PDVSA holds the remaining stake.

It has not been paid for its share of oil from the San Cristobal field in last few years. After this agreement, PDVSA has agreed to supply 17,000 barrels per day of crude oil to repay USD 537 million that it owes to OVL.

As part of the agreement, OVL will stand guarantee for the San Cristobal joint venture to raise USD 318 million capital required for raising production from the field to 27,000 bpd from current 18,000 bpd.

OVL had received its dividend from sale of crude oil produced from the field totaling USD 56.224 million for 2008.

But dividends for 2009 to 2013 totalling USD 537.631 million remained unpaid due to cash flow difficulties being faced by PDVSA.

The agreements were signed by OVL CEO Narendra K Verma and the Minister of Petroleum of Venezuela and President PDVSA, Eulogio Del Pino.

San Cristobal project is located in the Zuata Subdivision of proliferous Hugo Chavez Fria Orinoco Heavy Oil belt, in the Junin Norte Block in eastern Venezuela. The joint venture was incorporated in April 2008 consequent to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in March 2005 at New Delhi to jointly develop oil and gas exploration and production projects in Venezuela.

""The agreements provide for mechanism to liquidate OVL's outstanding dividends from the Project while at the same time, ONGC Videsh needs to obtain long term financing for the capital investments for implementing the Remediation Plan of the Project.

""The Remediation Plan aims to invigorate the field from its current production level of about 18,000 bpd to 27,000 bpd by the use of water flooding technique,"" the statement said.

Venezuela is India's fourth largest source of crude oil, supplying some 23.6 million tonnes or 12 per cent of the country's annual import in 2015-16.

OVL, along with Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Oil India Ltd, also holds 18 per cent stake in Venezuela's Carabobo-1 project, which currently produces about 16,000 bpd of oil and is expected to reach 90,000 bpd by end of 2017.",442,-0.9999867677688599

The recent hardening of global bond yields suggests that markets have finally started to appreciate the limited ability of global central banks to reduce short-term rates further and price in an increase in US Fed rate in December 2016, he feels.

He expects flows to be less supportive; emerging markets flows have reversed in the past 2-3 weeks perhaps reflecting outflows from passive macro funds on the back of higher global yields and a stronger US dollar.Don't miss: Buy, sell, hold: Investing calls on 12 stocks post results

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), has completed the acquisition of additional 11 per cent interest in Russia's Vankor oilfield, taking its total stake to 26 per cent.

The company signed a deal with Rosneft Oil Company to acquire additional 11 per cent stake in the East Siberian field for USD 930 million on October 28.

""We raised a bridge loan of USD 930 million from overseas lenders to pay for the acquisition cost of 11 per cent stake,"" OVL CEO and Managing Director Narendra K Verma said here.

OVL, which had previously bought 15 per cent stake in Vankor from Russian national oil firm Rosneft for USD 1.268 billion, will get an 7.3 million tons of oil equivalent from its 26 per cent stake.

OVL will tie-up long-term financing in the next 6 to 9 months to replace the bridge loan, he said.

Besides OVL's 26 per cent, a consortium of comprising Oil India (OIL), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat PetroResources (BPRL) has acquired 23.9 per cent stake in the field at a cost of USD 2.02 billion, giving them 6.56 million tons of oil.

After the stake sales, Rosneft holds 50.1 per cent stake in JSC Vankorneft, the company that operates the Vankor oilfield.

Verma and Igor Sechin, CEO, Rosneft, had on September 14 in Moscow inked an agreement to take the additional equity stake in Vankor. That agreement was subject to certain conditions including approvals from the Indian and Russian governments.

All approvals are in place, leading to closure of the deal, he said. ""The completion within very short period of the binding agreement reflects the speed and cooperation with which both OVL and Rosneft have moved and the support that the investments by Indian companies in Russian oil sector enjoy with the Russian and Indian governments."" Vankor is Rosneft's (and Russia's) second largest field by production and accounts for 4 per cent of the country's production.

The daily production from the field is around 410,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 26 per cent stake would give OVL about 107,000 bpd.

""The acquisition of additional 11 per cent would add about 30 per cent to the existing OVL's production at the current rate and approximately 2.2 million tons of oil and 1.0 billion cubic meters of gas annually,"" he said.

The field has recoverable reserves of 2.5 billion barrels.

The USD 2.2 billion OVL spent for acquiring 26 per cent stake in Vankor will be its third biggest acquisition. It had in 2013 paid USD 4.125 billion for 16 per cent stake in Mozambique's offshore Rovuma Area 1, which holds as much as 75 Trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.

In 2009, it had bought Russia-focused Imperial Energy for USD 2.1 billion. Prior to that, it had in 2001 paid USD 1.7 billion for 20 per cent interest in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field off Russia's far eastern coast.",504,

The board of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will on Thursday consider issuing a bonus share to increase liquidity ahead of government disinvestment.

With all of its about Rs 14,000 crore cash committed in future projects and capital expenditure, the company is considering issuing bonus shares rather than cash dividends as a method of providing income to shareholders.

The board on October 27 will consider the second quarter financial results as also ""consider a proposal for declaration of bonus issue"", the company said in a regulatory filing.

Issuing bonus shares increases the issued share capital of the company, which is then perceived as being bigger than it really is, making it more attractive to investors.

When a company issues bonus shares, the price of its existing shares comes down by about the same ratio as the bonus shares that have been issued. So, if the bonus issue is 1:1, which means they are issuing one additional share for each existing share, the market price of the share will roughly halve.

ONGC had in December 2010 issued 1:1 bonus share along with a special dividend of Rs 32 per share and a stock split.

At that point, ONGC equity share of Rs 10 face value was split into two of Rs 5 face value.

This was done as a precursor to the company's planned follow-on public offer (FPO) in the following year.

The government is considering divesting at least 5 percent of its shares through an FPO this fiscal to raise about Rs 12,500 crore.

Prior to that, the company had in 2006 issued a 1:2 bonus issue.

The government holds 68.93 percent stake in ONGC, the nation's biggest oil and gas explorer and the most profitable public sector unit.

The ONGC stock closed up 4.6 percent at Rs 292.90 on BSE today.",314,0.9892402291297913

""The use of a particular method of valuation will depend on health of the company, the sector in which it operates and the company's intrinsic strength,"" an official told PTI.

For this, the ministry has proposed at least five different valuation methodologies, including balance sheet method, transaction multiple, and asset valuation procedure, for these PSUs which will be up for outright sale or involves lowering of government equity below 50 percent.Also read - US policy not likely to change a lot if Trump wins: UR Bhat2:00 pm Market Check

Additionally, investor redemptions of 'long-duration' bond funds (duration more than 6 years) for 7th straight week and combined with the preference for 'short-duration' bond funds (duration less than 4 years) over 'long-duration' bond funds highest since end-QE3 taper tantrum is a clear reflection of investor worries on bond market as Fed hikes, Bank of Japan announces yield curve control & ECB taper talk, Hartnett says.

The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed last week has a dispute resolution mechanism set out wherein any differences over issues like valuation or natural gas reserves would be referred to a three-member committee of outside experts.

Sources said Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GPSC) is keen to get ONGC on board to help tide over its difficulties in producing gas from the Deendayal fields, which a decade back were touted as the biggest discovery in India.

GSPC began trial production of a very small volume of gas from August 4, 2014 but has not yet reached commercial production.

""Daily plateau production gas rate envisaged from Deen Dayal Upadhaya (DDN) West field is around 5.663 million standard cubic meters per day as per approved Field Development Plan (FDP) for a period of 14 years.

""There is problem of high pressure and high temperature in completion/drilling of wells in the field. No final date of commercial production has yet been given by operator (GSPC),"" according to an RTI reply by the Oil Ministry's technical arm DGH.

Sources said this is perhaps for the first time that a MoU sets out a dispute resolution committee and it perhaps is indication of the pitfalls that ONGC anticipates in buying a stake in the block.

It has already differed with GSPC on the gas reserves the block holds and has appointed US-based consultant Ryder Scott to do an independent assessment.

The three-member committee will include economist and former oil secretary Vijay Kelkar and former CVC P Shankar.

Since the BJP-led government came to power at the Centre, the Gujarat government firm GSPC has been seeking to sell a majority stake in its KG-OSN-2001/3 (Deendayal) block in Bay of Bengal to ONGC to avoid defaulting on loans.

ONGC initially was not keen to buy stake in the block as it felt the block had reserves far less than what GSPC was claiming and the asking price for the stake was not commensurate with the returns. But it has relented lately.

GSPC was to begin gas production from the block in 2013 but after sinking in USD 3.6 billion it was found that gas reserves are one-tenth of 20 trillion cubic feet claimed in 2005 and that too is technically difficult to produce.

In the process it has amassed Rs 19,576 crore of debt, on which interest cost was Rs 1,804.06 crore in 2014-15, according to the CAG. And against this, its revenue was Rs 152.51 crore in 2014-15.",437,-0.7197064359982809

Thanks to the slump in global oil markets, India's crude oil import bill nearly halved to $64 billion (from $112.7 billion) in the fiscal of 2015-16. According to Petroleum Ministry, India imported 202.1 million tonnes of crude oil in the fiscal year that ended March 31, compared to 189.4 million tonnes of crude oil in the previous 2014-15 fiscal.

But then, even as imports grew, the domestic crude oil production did not; it hovered at around 36.9 million tonnes in 2015-16, down from 37.5 million tonnes in last fiscal. The fall in global crude prices seems to slowed India's move towards energy independence.

In this light, the latest deal between oil major ONGC and GE assumes significance. ONGC has signed up a contract with GE Oil & Gas, under which the latter will support the state firm's exploratory drilling campaign in shallow to medium waters for the next three years. Ashish Bhandari, CEO -Oil & Gas, GE South Asia, in an interview with Shashwat DC, Features Editor (Special Projects), shares his take on the project and also talks about the prospects of domestic production in India. Excerpts.

Can you throw a bit more light on the new partnership with ONGC wherein GE will provide an estimated 55 subsea wellheads (SG5) over three years? How complex are these subsea wellheads?

Wellheads are critical pieces of equipment used as part of drilling and exploration campaigns. With this contract, GE will address most of ONGC’s needs for their anticipated activity over the next three years.

What is the kind of investments in India that this project will entail?

This specific project involves “service from India”. There are several other projects where we are actively considering “Make in India.” The partnership for subsea manifolds with L&T, our plant for BOPs in Chennai, and other capabilities in Pune and Coimbatore are good examples in this regard.

You have been a big votary for India's self-reliance, how do you think such exploratory drilling can aid the country's energy supply capabilities? What is the potential that we have?

India is not an oil and gas “rich” country, but we can do a lot more to maximize the potential that we have as a country. We have significant unchartered territory in deep water and even in discoveries that we have made, our recovery rates are typically much lower than global benchmarks. This can be improved. With better policy driving new technology and new investment, we can narrow our demand-supply gap. In the case of gas, we can indeed double domestic production in five years.

There has been much enthusiasm for the Modi government's new energy and gas pricing policy. Do you think it could provide the boost for domestic exploration of Oil & Gas, especially since the crash in the global crude prices has taken a toll on the domestic industry?

I think the new policies together are a very positive step forward. A lot of projects become viable, with marketing and pricing freedom for deepwater, marginal fields, and the forthcoming HELP, even at current energy prices. As a net energy importer, our threshold price for domestic production is higher than global benchmark pricing. LNG imports to India continue to rise 20%+ annually. While the crash in global prices has hurt domestic players, these policy decisions will make a lot of new projects viable.",576,0.663807233174642

Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.76 percent in early Asian trade, as the yen strengthened against the dollar. A stronger yen is generally seen as negative for Japanese stocks as it makes exports more expensive and reduces overseas earnings when translated back into the home currency.

US stocks rose slightly, nudging the Nasdaq to a record high close, as economic data bolstered views the Federal Reserve may decide against raising interest rates in the near term.

The S&P financial index, which tends to rise with expectations for higher rates, slipped 0.2 percent, while the S&P utilities index, which tends to benefit from a lower rate environment, rose 1.1 percent. A weaker-than-expected reading on the US services sector in August added to views the Fed will refrain from raising interest rates at its meeting this month.

The 50-share NSE Nifty surged 133.35 points or 1.51 percent to end at highest closing level of 8,943 since March 2015. It touched day's high of 8,950.85, driven largely by banks and auto stocks.

Justice AP Shah Committee today submitted a 'comprehensive report' on the compensation Reliance Industries should pay to ONGC for producing state-run firm's gas for the past seven years.

The one-man Committee headed by Ajit Prakash Shah, former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court, submitted to Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan a report containing not just the compensation to be paid for ONGC's gas migrating to adjacent KG-D6 block of RIL in the Krishna Godavari basin, but also recommendations for avoiding such disputes in future.

As much as 11.122 billion cubic meters of ONGC gas had migrated from its Godavari-PML and KG-DWN-98/2 blocks to adjoining KG-D6 of RIL between April 1, 2009 and March 31, 2015. At prevailing prices, the gas was worth Rs 11,000 crore.

While ONGC's reservoirs have almost emptied, RIL continues to produce gas from D1&D3 fields in KG-D6 block, some of it being of ONGC.

Refusing to divulge contents of his report, Shah said the report is ""comprehensive"" and addresses all terms of references.

""The Committee has also recommended future course of action for the ministry,"" he said.

Pradhan said the ministry has one month to decide on the report. ""Government will take appropriate action,"" he said.

""Justice AP Shah has submitted a comprehensive report on gas migration issue. He has preliminary briefed us on report,"" he said without giving details.

The panel has given ""some observations"" on the report of the independent expert DeGolyer & MacNaughton (D&M) that established reservoir continuity between the KG-D6 and contiguous ONGC operated blocks.

Asked if the Shah panel, like the D&M report, had established that gas from ONGC block had migrated to KG-D6 fields, Pradhan said, ""Yes."" The Shah Committee has ""detailed economic and legal implications"" of the gas migration under the signed Production Sharing Contract, he said, adding that the report would be made public after the ministry has studied it.

""Allow me to get back to you with detailing of the report,"" he said.

D&M had in its November 2015 report indicated that as on March 31, 2015, 44.32 per cent of the gas initially in place in Godavari PML and 34.71 per cent in KG-DWN-98/2 (both of ONGC) had migrated to KG-D6 of RIL. The report projected a higher proportion of gas migration and its production through RIL operated KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) block by end of 2019.

Pradhan said he had asked the Shah Committee was asked to look into legal, financial and contractual provisions on the gas migration row.

It was also asked to report any ""acts of omission and commission"" on part of all the stakeholders including RIL, ONGC, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons and the government, he said.Disclosure: Network 18, which publishes moneycontrol.com, is a part of the Reliance Group.",464,

It was a strong start to the July series on Friday as equity benchmarks ended at fresh 2016 highs, continuing uptrend for the fifth consecutive session following positive sentiment in global peers and value buying in select stocks.

The 30-share BSE Sensex rose 145.19 points or 0.54 percent to 27144.91 and the 50-share NSE Nifty was up 40.60 points or 0.49 percent at 8328.35. The broader markets outperformed benchmarks with the BSE Midcap index rising 1.2 percent.

After five-day rally, experts say they expect the market to consolidate next week with some profit booking, though the bias may remain on positive side. June quarter earnings, monsoon session of Parliament, GST Bill etc will be key events in July.

Jayant Manglik of Religare Securities says he feels midcap and smallcap will be more rewarding in days to come so traders should largely focus on accumulating quality stocks with short to medium term investment view.

The week was quite spectacular for the market despite Brexit fears. Not only India but also global markets showed strong performance by shrugging off concerns raised after the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union. Analysts do not expect any immediate impact of Brexit on global economy.

During the week, the Sensex rallied 2.8 percent (747 points) and Nifty 3 percent on good monsoon progress, cabinet's approval for 7th Pay Commission recommendations, government reforms to boost private sector and positive global mood.

Strides Shasun rose 4 percent as the USFDA inspected the company's new oral dosage facility without any observations in Bangalore.

GAIL gained 2.6 percent on stellar listing of Mahanagar Gas, wherein the company is a promoter along with British Gas Asia Pacific Holdings. Mahanagar Gas rallied 23.6 percent to close at Rs 520.30, driven by value buying and positive market sentiment.

Jaiprakash Associates fell 3 percent and UltraTech Cement gained half a percent as CNBC-TV18 learnt from sources that JP Associates' lenders lost patience with the promoters, proposing to invoke the strategic debt restructuring clause and this could put the UltraTech-JP cement deal in jeopardy.

While the currency partially recovered losses, investors warn Rajan's replacement, who is yet to be named, will need to be seen as credible and somebody who can defend the central bank's autonomy at a critical juncture in its history.

The safe-haven yen held firm after hitting a three-year peak against the euro and sterling and a six-week high versus the dollar yesterday on concerns Britain could vote to leave the European Union in a referendum two weeks from now. The pound resumed losses as new polls indicated support for the UK leaving the European Union. Cues to watch out will be the two-day US Fed meeting that begins today.

Weak macro data may also hurt market today as retail inflation rose to nearly two-year high of 5.76 percent in May mainly due to rising prices of food items, including vegetables.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has been offered a stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's (GSPC) Krishna Godavari basin block in an attempt to the Gujarat government firm's Rs 19,500 crore loan from turning into an NPA.

""I can only tell (Congress leader) Jairam Ramesh that exploration and production activities should not be seen in isolation,"" he told reporters here. ""If they (UPA Government) had provided marketing freedom as guaranteed under the PSC, GSPC could have produced gas by now."" The UPA government had fixed a cap on price of natural gas in contravention of the signed production sharing contract (PSC), which made developing the gas from the difficult field difficult.

Pradhan said company-to-company discussions were taking place on a possible collaboration between ONGC and GSPC.

""These are commercial discussions and my best wishes are with the two companies."" ""If they are able to reach a commercial understanding, keeping their profitability in mind, we must not have any problem,"" he said.

Ramesh had yesterday alleged that Pradhan was making attempts to ""palm off"" the KG gas block to ONGC to ""protect"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Pradhan has virtually turned into an investment banker to force a ""merger"" between ONGC and GSPC's KG block and is making ""outrageous claims"" to justify such a course of action, he had said yesterday.

Since the BJP-led government took power in the Centre, Gujarat State Petroleum Corp Ltd (GSPC) is seeking to sell a majority stake in its KG-OSN-2001/3 (Deendayal) block in Bay of Bengal to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), sources said.

GSPC was to begin gas production from the block in 2013 but after sinking in USD 3.6 billion it was found that gas reserves are one-tenth of 20 trillion cubic feet claimed in 2005 and that too is technically difficult to produce.

In the process it has amassed Rs 19,576 crore of debt, on which interest cost was Rs 1,804.06 crore in 2014-15, according to the CAG. And against this its revenue was Rs 152.51 crore in 2014-15.

Sources said GSPC has been doing trial production of a very small volume of gas from August 4, 2014 and has not yet reached commercial production and in absence of revenue commensurate with the debt servicing obligations it risks becoming a defaulter.

To bail out of the situation, a few weeks back it offered to sell 50 per cent stake to ONGC, they said.

GSPC is producing 0.6 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) of gas from the field as trial production for almost two years now.

As per the approved field development plan (FDP), natural gas production was to reach 3.83 mmscmd in second year and achieve peak output of 5.24 mmscmd in the third.",503,0.02583673596382141

State-run oil & gas explorer ONGC's fourth quarter standalone profit jumped over 3-fold to Rs 4,416 crore compared to December quarter, driven by other income and exceptional gains despite sharp rise in tax cost.

Revenue declined 11.4 percent to Rs 16,385 crore in January-March quarter against Rs 18,498 crore in December quarter.

Bottomline and topline beat analysts' expectations but operational performance was a miss. Profit was expected in the range of Rs 1,500-2,500 crore on revenue of Rs 15,682 crore for the quarter, according to analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Operating profit (EBITDA - earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) plunged 44.2 percent to Rs 4,487 crore and margin contracted by 1560 basis points to 27.4 percent compared to third quarter. Analysts estimated EBITDA at Rs 6,045 crore and margin at 39 percent for the quarter.

Tax expenses saw more than 5-fold jump at Rs 1,931 crore in March quarter against Rs 368.7 crore in December quarter.

Profit in FY16 fell 9.8 percent to Rs 16,003.7 crore compared to previous year due to exceptional loss (Rs 3,142.2 crore) despite a 15.5 percent increase in other income. Profit was also impacted by discount (of Rs 607 crore against Rs 20,437 crore YoY) given to oil marketing companies. Revenue in same period declined 5.4 percent to Rs 78,387.5 crore.

Meanwhile, the board of directors of the company has recommended a final dividend of Rs 3.25 per share, in addition to interim dividend of Rs 5.25 per share. Hence, total dividend amount for FY16 stood at Rs 7,273 crore against Rs 8,128 crore in previous year.

Analysts say as oil prices have remained weak, and domestic gas prices have reduced further by a sharp 20 percent from April 1 (2016), the near-term outlook also remains weak for ONGC.

Nomura says, ""Currently, the NDA (BJP+) has 68 out of 243 seats in the Upper House (plus five nominated seats). Together these five states account for 51 seats in the Upper House, of which six will come up for re-election in 2016 (all in Tamil Nadu), six in 2017 (all in West Bengal) and eight in 2018 (West Bengal and Kerala). The BJP’s victory in Assam will not help, as none of the seats (seven in the Upper House) are up for re-election until 2019. However, its improved tally in West Bengal and Kerala should help (although it depends on BJP’s final share of seats). Overall, if the exit polls are accurate, then the state election results could marginally improve the BJP’s seat tally in the Upper House, but the government will need to continue to build a consensus to push through legislative reforms in the Upper House (since its seat share remains under 50 percent ).""Don't miss: Modi magic!

The dollar slipped against the euro and pound after a report showed that the US manufacturing industry continues to face headwinds.

The yen too weakened as risk appetite improved with the rise in oil prices and Japan, set to host a G7 meeting later this week, again signalled its willingness to intervene in the market to weaken its currency.

Asian markets advanced as energy plays rallied after rising oil prices spurred a banner session on Wall Street.
