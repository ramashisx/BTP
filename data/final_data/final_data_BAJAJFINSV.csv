Take for instance a home renovation project or that post-graduation course that you’ve been eyeing for a while. Both these usually demand a huge expense, and we typically push these for a later time. But what if you could make these expenses and split the costs into manageable EMIs?

Personal loans could be very useful in these circumstances. These loans can be utilised for a variety of objectives, such as paying for unexpected medical expenditures, organising an extravagant wedding, upgrading your home and more. There are various NBFCs and banks that provide low-interest personal loans with minimal documentation requirements. Bajaj Finance Limited is one such NBFC that provides personal loans with several attractive benefits.

2023-11-10 16:07:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/10-tips-for-maximising-returns-with-sip-mutual-funds-11721181.html,"A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) offers a clever approach to mutual fund investments. With SIPs, investors can regularly commit a fixed sum of money, be it on a monthly or quarterly basis. This method of investing in mutual funds is highly effective because it aids in spreading out the cost of investments over time and mitigates the impact of market fluctuations.

Here are ten tips for maximising returns with SIP mutual funds:





Start Early: Starting your SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) early is crucial to harness the power of compounding. Compounding is the phenomenon where your earnings may generate additional earnings as time progresses, creating a growing financial snowball. The longer your money is invested, the more time it has to grow exponentially. By starting early, even with small contributions, you can may accumulate substantial wealth in the long run. This is why financial experts emphasize the importance of beginning your SIP journey as soon as possible, ideally in your 20s or early 30s.

Invest Regularly: Discipline is a key factor in achieving your financial goals through SIP. Make a commitment to invest a fixed amount regularly, whether it is monthly or quarterly. Sticking to your SIP routine ensures that you benefit from rupee cost averaging, which means you buy more units when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high. This discipline also prevents you from making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations.

Choose the Right Fund: Choosing the right mutual fund is crucial to maximising returns. It is important to select a mutual fund that aligns with your investment goals, risk appetite, and investment horizon. Interestingly, Bajaj Finserv Platform offers a selection of over 1,000 mutual fund schemes, providing investors with a wide array of options to find the perfect mutual fund scheme that aligns with their specific requirements.

Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification plays a crucial role in risk reduction, optimising returns, and maintaining stability within your investment portfolio. It is important to invest in a mix of equity, debt, and possibly others like gold or real estate mutual funds to diversify your portfolio. By holding different types of assets, you can potentially offset losses in one with gains in another. It is a way to balance risk and reward in your investment journey, making your portfolio less vulnerable to market fluctuations.

Increase SIP Amounts Over Time: As your income grows, consider increasing the amount you invest in your SIPs. This is an effective way to accelerate wealth creation. By gradually raising your SIP contributions, you can take advantage of rising income and avoid the risk of falling behind in your financial goals.

Monitor Your Portfolio: Keeping a close eye on your SIP portfolio is essential. Regularly monitor the performance of your investments and make adjustments to your portfolio if necessary. Staying informed about your holdings helps you make informed decisions and ensure your investments align with your financial goals.

Avoid Timing the Market: Timing the market is a risky strategy that can lead to losses. It is important to avoid trying to time the market and instead focus on investing regularly in SIP mutual funds.

Keep Your Investment Horizon in Mind: Your investment horizon is the length of time you plan to hold your investments. It is important to keep your investment horizon in mind when selecting mutual funds. As a general guideline, it is recommended to maintain your investments in the market for an extended duration to achieve the best possible returns. SIP is an investment tool specifically designed for long-term objectives. While you can redeem your investments at any time, the real benefits emerge over extended periods. Investing for the long term allows you to ride out market volatility and benefit from the compounding effect. It also aligns well with long-term financial goals like retirement planning and wealth accumulation.

Use a SIP Return Calculator: Calculating the potential returns on your SIP investments is a crucial step for informed decision-making. An SIP return calculator helps you estimate how your investments may grow over time based on your contributions, the chosen funds, and the expected rate of return provided by you historical performance. It empowers you to set realistic financial goals and align your SIP strategy accordingly. Bajaj Finserv offers an online SIP calculator that can help you calculate the expected returns on your investments. However, such calculations does not factor the actual performance of the fund and should not be treated as any advice or assurance about the actual return of investment.

Expense ratio and commission: When investing in mutual funds, you should pay attention to two important factors:

● The Expense Ratio

● Commissions

The expense ratio can vary from one mutual fund scheme to another. A higher expense ratio means that a larger portion of your investment returns will be consumed by fees and expenses. Additionally, brokers or mutual fund platforms may charge a commission, reducing your overall investment.

However, platforms like the Bajaj Finserv Mutual Fund platform don't charge any commission, meaning you get to keep more of your returns, ultimately increasing your overall profits.

In conclusion, SIP is a great way to invest in mutual funds by following these ten tips, you may can maximise your returns and may achieve your investment goals. Bajaj Finserv Mutual Funds and Bajaj Finserv SIP are great options for investors who want to invest in mutual funds. Use the SIP return calculator to calculate your expected returns and invest in a mutual fund that suits your needs on the Bajaj Finserv platform.

Disclaimer: Mutual funds are subject to market risks, read all the scheme related documents carefully.

Gold has a special place in our traditions and culture, whether it is for special occasions or securing our finances. Knowing what drives gold prices can help you navigate this ever-changing market.

So, let’s look at the key factors behind the fluctuating gold prices, and how to stay informed about the gold rate today in various Indian cities.

Factors influencing gold price in India

The price of gold in India, like anywhere else in the world, is influenced by multiple factors. Here are some key elements that play a role in determining the gold rate today in Bangalore, or any other Indian city.

1. Global market trends: The global gold market has a significant impact on gold prices in India. Any developments in international markets, geopolitical events, or changes in the value of the U.S. dollar can have a direct influence on the gold rate.

2. Local demand and supply: Domestic demand and supply for gold also affect its price. During festive seasons and weddings, the demand for gold tends to rise, which can lead to an increase in the gold rate. Additionally, imports, customs duties, and government policies can impact the supply and ultimately the price of gold.

3. Government regulations: Government policies, such as changes in import duties or restrictions, can impact the gold market. For instance, an increase in import duties can lead to a rise in gold prices.

4. Currency exchange rates: Exchange rates play a crucial role. When the Indian Rupee weakens against the U.S. Dollar, the price of gold in India tends to rise, and vice versa.

5. Investor sentiment: The sentiment and behaviour of investors play a significant role in shaping gold prices. During times of economic uncertainty or market volatility, investors often turn to gold as a safe-haven asset. Increased investment demand can drive up gold prices. Conversely, in more stable economic conditions, reduced investor interest in gold may lead to lower prices. The psychology and sentiment of investors can have a substantial impact on short-term fluctuations in gold rates.

Staying updated on the gold rate in India

When it comes to making well-informed decisions about gold purchases and investments, having a reliable source for up-to-date information is crucial. Bajaj Finance offers accurate and real-time information about the gold rate today in various cities, including Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata.

So, whether you are planning to buy gold jewellery for a special occasion or considering gold as an investment, you can rely on Bajaj Finance to provide you with the most current and precise information about the gold rate across India.

Bears ruled the trade as the Nifty witnessed selling pressure throughout the day on October 18. The index found resistance at 19,850, which led to a fall towards 19,650.

Going forward, the index may witness a rangebound move until it breaks out in either direction. A fall below 19,650 might give bears more strength and the Nifty might fall towards 19,250. On the higher end, a decisive move above 19,850 might open the way towards 20,200.

The Bank Nifty index experienced a bearish phase, encountering strong resistance at 44,500, where the highest open interest is concentrated. The weak undertone in the market suggests a preference for selling on price rallies, and a breach of the 43,800 support level is expected to lead to further selling pressure.

The index's position below the 20-DMA reinforces the bearish sentiment in the near term.

Here are two buy calls and one sell call for short term:

Ujjivan Small Finance Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 57.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 54.8 | Target: Rs 62 | Return: 8.5 percent

Ujjivan Small Finance Bank has experienced a rounding bottom pattern breakout on the 30-minute chart, indicating an increase in optimism. The stock found support around the 20-SMA (Rs 55.24) before recovering towards higher levels.

According to the current setup, the stock might move towards Rs 62 in the near term. On the lower end, support is positioned at Rs 54.80.

Dr Reddy's Laboratories: Buy | LTP: Rs 5,677 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,580 | Target: Rs 5,900 | Return: 4 percent

Dr Reddy's Labs stock has broken out of a falling trendline with strong volume support, confirming a bullish sentiment. The positive RSI (relative strength index) crossover suggests increasing upward momentum. The stock has support at Rs 5,580, and potential upside targets are in the range of Rs 5,800 to Rs 5,900.

Bajaj Finserv: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,628 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,680 | Target: Rs 1,500 | Return: 8 percent

Bajaj Finserv has fallen following a double top formation on the daily chart. Additionally, the stock has formed a Bearish Engulfing pattern, and the RSI is showing bearish divergence.

Over the short term, the stock might decline towards Rs 1,500. The resistance is located at Rs 1,680.

Govind Parikh has an investment track record of more number of years than the average age of fund managers in India, and perhaps double the age of the new-gen traders in the derivatives segment.

For the very first time, in a formal media interaction, he speaks exclusively to Moneycontrol’s Santosh Nair about his journey, investment thinking, hits and misses.

How did you get initiated into investing?

After I completed my engineering course, my uncle Naresh Khandwala put me in touch with KC Shroff, the managing director of Excel Industries. I went to see Shroff armed with a project work for a plant making santalin dye from sandalwood, the study having been done by a classmate. Two questions and Shroff caught my bluff. I said the project was for a 100 tonne per day plant. And he laughed saying, “Son, there is not enough sandalwood on earth to make a plant of this capacity.” He told my uncle that a better career for me would be trading and not a factory shop floor.

Then, I had a chance visit to KR Choksey’s home – a veteran investor of those times. He ran me through some of numbers of Bajaj Auto from its annual report and explained why the company will do well. That was a turning point, I got seriously interested in investing. Choksey become my mentor and guide. He took me with him on many company AGMs and plant visits.

Take us through some of your early bets...

Ramco Cements (then Madras Cements) and Lakshmi Machine Works were my early bets and they worked out quite well. There was a lot of 20 shares of Ramco which was on offer when the company’s market cap was Rs 1.6 crore and the Rs 100 paid up share was available for Rs 60.

The investment in LMW was accidental. I bought shares of its arm Lakshmi Electric Control and when I went to visit the plant to find out more about the company, one of the senior executives there asked him to have a look at the LMW plant. The Rs 100-paid up stock was available for Rs 180 at a market cap of around Rs 8 crore. Impressed by the size of the plant and the long waiting list of customers, I decided to invest in the stock, which would eventually go on to hit Rs 15,000 (adjusted for bonus) over the next few years. But I sold way before the stock peaked, because I was making a profit which seemed too good to be true!

You are known to visit factories and managements before investing. Tell us about some big winners you were able to spot because of this approach

I once had a chance to impress my mentor KR Choksey! I arranged a meeting for him with the usually reclusive MRF management in the 80s. The stock was quoting around Rs 40, and the company was expanding its capacity. After we stepped out from the meeting, Choksey clasped my hands and shook it hard. “Very good, very good,“ he said.

I did not understand the cause of his excitement, but he had worked out that MRF’s profits were set to more than double once the new plant was commissioned in 18 months, because turnover would double and the margins were much better. And since there was no equity dilution, the EPS (earnings per share) would reflect the profits soon. I myself bought 500 shares at Rs 40, but as usual cashed out quickly.

Were managements always welcoming with information about how their companies were faring?

Well, there were occasions when plant visits disappointed, though at times in an amusing way. Once I travelled to interior Andhra Pradesh to meet up with the management of a tyre retreading company. I endured a bumpy ride in an Ambassador car on the last leg of the journey to reach the plant. I had gone prepared with a long list of questions written on a paper and was expecting to be taken on a tour of the plant by the managing director. That did not happen.

When I started asking the questions from the paper, the MD took it from me, read the questions and handed it back. “All this is not required. The company is doing well. Let’s have lunch,” he said. I was presumptuous in thinking that the company would take a small shareholder like me seriously!

Jokes apart, management quality is a critical tick box in the list of attributes I look for in a company. You will get value if you look hard enough, and the companies may make profits as well, but capital allocation is where most managements trip up, sometimes the promoter will buy an aircraft or some such using shareholder funds. For us, it matters how well the promoters treat minority shareholders. Because that is often an indicator how the capital allocation decisions are likely to be.

Most people understand how to buy, but when to sell is always a challenge…

We buy shares to hold, but also keep reviewing our positions. There would just be a handful of shares that we have not sold at all, 3M is one of them. We definitely sell to book profits, but not all of it at the same time. As long as we see growth, we keep some shares.

Two changes I made to my approach after the market crash of 2008 was one, always keep a part of your portfolio in cash and two, don’t wait till the prices fall all the way. We are OK as long as a stock falls up to 20 percent, not more. Our first aim is to protect capital. While identifying a stock, we think in terms of how much money we could possibly lose and then decide if the upside is worth the risk.

For example, we picked up Tata Motors around Rs 80 when the stock was in a free fall during the COVID meltdown in March 2020. I was not sure how much money I would make when things improved, but I was certain that I had little to lose at that price.

You invest in holding companies, something most investors are averse to…

We look for holding companies, where either there is a sharp discount to the NAV (net asset value of the companies held by it) or where the underlying companies have strong growth potential. In the first case, just the narrowing of the discount, even if the underlying companies’ value remains the same, is good enough to earn a handsome profit.

We doubled our investments in Maharashtra Scooters when the discount to the value of its holdings in Bajaj Auto and Bajaj Finserv reduced from 84 percent to 68 percent.

Besides, there are times when the strong performance of the underlying, like in the case of Bajaj Holdings, which held shares of Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Finance, resulted in much heftier profits.

Why not buy the underlying companies directly then?

We do buy the underlying companies directly, but we also buy the holding company because the margin of safety is much higher. And we have made huge profits from our investments in holding companies over the years.

Do you invest in cyclical stocks?

Yes, we do. We buy them when they are very, very cheap, and sell them when they are less cheap. We don’t wait for the fair value to be realised, or for them to be overvalued. Because, in a bull market, you will hear crazy price targets for the same stocks that nobody was willing to touch at one-tenth the price. We should not forget that these are cyclical stocks, and after two years again the cycle will again turn for the worse.

But how do you know when stocks are extremely cheap?

For steel, you should look at what is happening in China, in other global markets, look at the input prices. They will give you an idea. We buy metal companies only when there is a general feeling in the market that the world is coming to an end.

Tell us about your selling strategy

Let me give you a little background. Sometime in the early 80s, I had bought 500 shares of Kinetic Engineering at Rs 30. As soon as the price doubled, my father started pushing me to sell the shares. His thinking was that 18 percent (per annum) gain was good enough and anything more than that was risky, unsustainable and amounted to usury. Finally, I gave in to his wish when the stock reached Rs 80, but on one condition. I would sell 400 shares, but retain 100 shares since we had recovered our capital and made a good profit. He agreed.

The stock eventually went on to hit Rs 720 (adjusted for bonus) in five years. Obviously, you regret when the stock moves up a lot after you sell, but it is not a bad idea to take profits home periodically.

Usually, when clients buy shares, initially, they have a selling target, but as the price moves up, they keep increasing the target. They become possessive about the stock and forget the prudent principles of selling. I keep reminding them about the uncertain nature of the market. Things can change overnight. You have nothing to lose by booking profits. Some clients say they are afraid of selling because they may not get a chance to buy the shares at lower levels. I tell them they don’t have to buy the same stock, there are plenty of other shares you can buy and make money on.

Have you ever sold a stock and then changed your mind on it?

Auto ancillary company Bosch was one such case. I was bullish on the stock for many years till 2015, and had accumulated a huge quantity. When the price hit Rs 20,000, we started selling thinking it was overvalued, selling our last quantity at the peak price of around Rs 27,000 because a fund was buying aggressively at that point. To date that has been my only best sale, where the price has still not come back to the level I sold at. We thought the company’s earnings were unlikely to grow as fast as before as the world was now moving towards electric.

We had intended to buy it at lower levels, but when prices fell, for some reason, we stayed out. Finally, after touching a low of 7500 when the stock started rising, we began building a position again. Now we are bullish on the stock, because there is better clarity on the company’s business. The diesel fuel injection system engines will be around till 2031-32. And what we had not thought was that if investors could see the hit to the company’s earnings because of the shift to electric vehicles, the company would have seen it coming even earlier and planned accordingly. Today, in electric vehicles, Bosch has gone so much ahead of others.

Do you regret selling stocks early?

While I do sometimes regret having sold shares early on, the approach has worked well on the whole. Booking profits helps you create that powerful asset called bear market buying power. Having learnt a hard lesson in 2008, we had some cash on hand when the market nosedived at the peak of the COVID panic in March 2020. We expected the market to go down to 10,000 and stabilise. But the market kept sliding. We were able to buy some quantity at an index level of 8000 when blue chips were available at unbelievable prices, and we still had some ammo left.

Your worst nightmare that came true…

When the global financial crisis hit (in 2008), my portfolio value shrank nearly 80 percent. It hurt, but thankfully it was not borrowed money, and so we were not pushed out of the market.

Most importantly, it did not affect our lifestyle since we were always conservative in our expenses. But the experience taught me the importance of keeping a part of the portfolio in cash.

Take us through your misses...

One big miss was the initial public offering of Infosys even though I had a chance of being allotted 500 shares. The late Manek Bhansali, one of the founders of Enam had asked me to apply for 500 shares in the firm allotment portion. I happened to be with Vinod Sethi (former Morgan Stanley fund manager) when he got a call informing him that the Infosys issue had bombed. His reaction was: ‘that’s great.‘ I was yet to apply for the IPO, but Sethi’s reaction made me wary. I did not ask him the reason for that. I wish I had!

Some years later when I asked him the reason, he told me that Infosys issue being undersubscribed was good news for investors who understood the value of the business, as they would be allotted more shares.

Another miss: the massive upside in TTK Prestige. I read too much into a friend’s decision to sell the stock. That friend happened to be a mid-level executive in one of the TTK Group companies. I had identified the stock when it was going for Rs 20, and it had appreciated to Rs 200 over time. I thought that because my friend had sold, he would be aware of something that the market did not know.

I asked him the reason, and he said he was not allowed to discuss matters relating to the group with outsiders, but he wrote out a letter of introduction for me which I could show at the Bangalore plant and speak to the people there to get an idea of how the company was doing. I kept telling myself there had to be a reason why my friend sold the shares. And I was too lazy to take the trouble of going to Bangalore and find out for myself about the company. So I took the easy way out of selling my shares. It was to be a costly mistake. The stock would go on to hit Rs 9000 in some years. And the reason my friend had sold his shares was that he had been planning to go on a Europe tour and needed the money.

What’s your advice to new investors?

Never have a lifestyle that cannot be sustained when stock prices fall.

Accept mistakes and try to correct them instead of saying you are right and the market is wrong.

The primary goal should be to protect capital.

It’s difficult to make very large money through short-term trading.

Think long term.

The market remained weak for the third consecutive week but traded largely within the previous week's range of 19,300-19,800, which is likely to be crucial for either side of direction, going ahead. If the index breaks 19,300, then it may get the next support around 19,000, whereas on the higher side, 19,600-19,650 is expected to be a crucial hurdle in the near term, experts said. According to them, 18,850-18,900 is likely to be crucial support area, which also coincides with horizontal resistance trendline adjoining highs of November 2022 and the week ended June 23.

The Nifty50 fell 0.45 percent or 89 points to 19,428 for the week ended August 11, forming a bearish candlestick pattern with lower highs for the third straight week on the weekly scale.

""On the weekly and monthly chart, positional trend of the Nifty seems very strong, but definitely there is a sign of weakness in the index for the short term and the index could extend its correction but we believe that the downside in the market would be limited,"" Vinay Rajani, CMT, senior technical and derivative analyst at HDFC Securities. said.

He feels the first semblance of support is expected in the 19,050-19,100 zone. If this zone is broken, then the next support comes in the zone of 18,850-18,900 which, he thinks, would be a good buying opportunity in the index. Any level above 19,650 in the near term, would negate the short-term downtrend, he says.

Considering the current scenario, Osho Krishan, senior analyst - technical and derivative research at Angel One, advised to avoid undue risk and aggressive trades in the indices.

The broader market space is keeping up the buzz, in which one needs to be very selective while choosing stock-centric moves for an outperformance, he says.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the August 11 closing prices:

After a short-term correction, the stock took the support near Rs 2,465 and reversed. Post reversal, it has formed higher bottom formation on daily and intraday charts, which is largely positive.

Currently, the stock is witnessing positive consolidation near 20-day SMA (simple moving average) which indicates strong possibility of fresh uptrend rally from the current levels.

Unless it is trading below Rs 2,475, positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target Rs 2,650-2,660. Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any between Rs 2,550 and Rs 2,500 levels with a stop-loss below Rs 2,475.

Bajaj Finserv: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,504 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,465 | Targets: Rs 1,600-1,620 | Return: 8 percent

We are of the view that, the stock has completed one leg of correction and if it succeeds trade above 200-day SMA or Rs 1,465 then we could expect a fresh uptrend rally from the current levels.

For the positional traders now, Rs 1,465 or 200-day SMA is the key level to watch out, above which, the stock could rally till Rs 1,600-1,620. On the flip side, below Rs 1,465, traders may prefer to exit from the trading long positions.

LIC Housing Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 425 | Stop-Loss: Rs 410 | Targets: Rs 450-462 | Return: 9 percent

The stock is holding a higher bottom formation on daily charts and it is comfortably trading above 20 and 50-day SMAs which is largely positive.

We are of the view that, as long as it is trading above Rs 410 or 20-day SMA the positive sentiment is likely to continue. Above the same, the stock could move up till Rs 450 and further upside may also continue which could lift the stock till Rs 462.

In the dynamic landscape of personal finance, tax-saving investments hold paramount importance in securing a stable financial future and maximizing wealth. Among the various options available, Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) funds have emerged as a popular choice for Indian investors. ELSS funds not only offer the potential for good returns but also provide tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. This comprehensive guide aims to unlock the world of ELSS funds and shed light on their unique features and benefits, empowering Indian investors to make informed decisions and save tax while building wealth.

Understanding ELSS funds:

ELSS funds are a category of mutual funds that primarily invest in equity and equity-related instruments. These funds offer investors an opportunity to participate in the growth potential of the stock market while enjoying tax benefits. ELSS funds on the Bajaj Finance platform come with a lock-in period of three years, which is the shortest among all tax-saving investment options under Section 80C. This feature allows investors to enjoy the benefits of long-term equity investing while fulfilling their tax-saving obligations.

Tax benefits of ELSS funds:

One of the core advantages of investing in ELSS funds is the tax benefits they offer. Investments in ELSS funds are eligible for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act up to a maximum limit of Rs. 1.5 lakh per financial year. This tax-saving avenue not only helps investors save money, but also provides an opportunity for wealth creation through equity participation. You should consult your own tax consultant/ financial advisor to understand specific tax implications arising out of your investment in Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS).

The power of equity investment:

Equity mutual funds, including ELSS funds, have historically outperformed other asset classes over the long term. By investing in equity, investors have the potential to earn higher returns compared to traditional fixed-income instruments like fixed deposits and debt mutual funds. However, it is essential to note that equity investments are subject to market risks, and the value of investments can fluctuate. It is advisable to adopt a long-term investment approach while investing in ELSS funds to mitigate short-term market volatility.

Building wealth:

ELSS funds strike the perfect balance between tax saving and wealth creation. Unlike other tax-saving instruments like Public Provident Fund (PPF) or National Savings Certificate (NSC), ELSS funds have the potential to deliver higher returns due to their equity exposure. Over a longer investment horizon, the power of compounding can work wonders in multiplying wealth. By investing in ELSS funds consistently, investors can not only save tax but also build a substantial corpus to achieve their financial goals.

The Core USP of ELSS funds:

The unique selling proposition (USP) of ELSS funds lies in their ability to offer tax benefits while generating potentially higher returns through equity investments. This combination of tax-saving and wealth creation distinguishes ELSS funds from other investment options available under Section 80C. Investors can choose between growth and dividend options, and they have the flexibility to invest through Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). Moreover, the lock-in period of three years instils discipline and helps investors stay invested for the long term, reaping the benefits of compounding.

In addition to these factors, purchasing an ELSS fund through the Bajaj Finserv platform benefits from the brand trust of Bajaj, enhancing the overall experience. The platform provides an end-to-end online journey, allowing investors to manage their portfolio after making the purchase. The platform also has smart tools like the SIP calculator that helps in calculating estimated returns with ease.

Bajaj Finserv offers a diverse selection of over 30 ELSS funds from the country's best Asset Management Companies (AMCs).

By Kunal Shah, senior technical & derivative analyst at LKP Securities

Indian equities saw another day of gains with the headline index Nifty50 holding strong amidst volatile trading. The market trend remains positive as the index stayed above the moving average. The support is found at 19,700, while resistance is expected between 19,800 and 20,000 levels.

The Bank Nifty index experienced buying interest from lower levels, indicating that bulls are active in the market. The index has managed to hold the support zone between 45,300 and 45,200, which is a positive sign for the buyers. The immediate resistance on the upside is situated at 45,800.

If the index manages to sustain above this level, it is likely to open up further upside potential towards 46,000 and 46,300 levels. The overall undertone of the Bank Nifty index remains bullish, suggesting that the prevailing trend is in favour of the bulls.

Given this bullish sentiment, it is recommended to adopt a ""buy on dip"" approach. This means investors should consider buying when there is a temporary decline or pullback in the index's price, as the overall trend is expected to remain positive.

Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

Canara Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 338.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 320 | Target: Rs 380-400 | Return: 18 percent

Canara Bank is exhibiting a bullish pattern known as a ""rounding bottom"" formation. This indicates a potential reversal of the previous downtrend and a shift towards a bullish trend. The stock's uptrend remains intact, with a pattern of higher highs and higher lows being observed on the price chart. This is a positive sign for buyers, as it shows sustained upward momentum.

The momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) is trading above the 60 level, further confirming the stock's strong momentum and suggesting that the buying interest is robust.

The stock has a strong support level around Rs 320, where buyers are actively participating and holding the price from falling further. Given the bullish structure and strong momentum, the stock has a potential upside target of Rs 380 to Rs 400. This implies that the stock may move higher in the near future.

Sterlite Technologies: Buy | LTP: Rs 153 | Stop-Loss: Rs 146 | Targets: Rs 161-167 | Return: 9 percent

Sterlite Technologies has experienced a ""falling trendline breakout"" on the price chart, which is a bullish signal indicating a potential reversal of the previous downtrend. The breakout was accompanied by a sharp surge in volumes, suggesting increased buying interest and participation in the stock.

The momentum indicator RSI has shown a ""positive crossover,"" further confirming the buy signal and indicating that the stock's momentum is turning positive.

The stock has a strong support level at its 20-day moving average (DMA), which is placed at Rs 148. This moving average acts as a dynamic support and has historically been relevant in supporting the stock's price during uptrends.

Given the falling trendline breakout, positive momentum, and strong support at the 20 DMA, the stock may have potential upside.

Bajaj Finserv: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,644 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,600 | Target Rs 1,750 | Return: 6.4 percent

Bajaj Finserv witnessed a consolidation breakout on the daily chart and has maintained its position above a crucial moving average.

The RSI indicator shows a bullish crossover. The stock has support at Rs 1,600 and faces resistance at Rs 1,750 on the higher end.

Ahead of Canada Pension Fund paring its stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank, SBI Life Insurance added shares worth Rs 335 crore of the private lender in the month of May.

Kotak Mahindra Bank settled 0.6 percent lower on June 9 at Rs 1,874 on the NSE, as foreign institutional investor Canada Pension Fund sold 1.7 percent stake. As of March end, it held 4.3 percent stake in the bank.

On the flipside, ICICI Prudential Life reduced stake worth Rs 678 crore in the stock and HDFC Life cut stake worth Rs 21 crore.

The big moves

In a flurry of activity in May, the key additions made by insurance houses were Vedant Fashions, IDFC First Bank, Star Health, ITC, and Rainbow Children. While Kotak Mahindra Bank, Interglobe Aviation, L&T, Axis Bank, and UltraTech Cement were the key reductions, as per Nuvama Research's Insurance Portfolio Analyser.

Life insurers make money by deploying the premium they collect from policyholders into investments.

According to the report, ICICI Pru Life added Vedant Fashions, Star Health, and Bajaj Finserv, with investments amounting to Rs 223 crore, Rs 182 crore, and Rs 101 crore, respectively.

Apart from Kotak Bank, the insurance house reduced its stake in Interglobe Aviation and L&T by Rs 296 crore and Rs 126 crore, respectively.

SBI Life, another major player in the insurance industry, has added shares of HDFC worth Rs 310 crore and ITC worth Rs 219 crore. However, it has significantly reduced its investments in Cummins, SRF, and Infosys, with reductions totaling Rs 185 crore, Rs 179 crore, and Rs 158 crore, respectively.

For HDFC Life, key additions were Rainbow Children's, HDFC, and LTI Mindtree, amounting to Rs 156 crore, Rs 119 crore, and Rs 52 crore, respectively. However, it pared its stake worth Rs 104 crore in HDFC Bank.

Tata AIA Life's major additions were ITC, IDFC First Bank, and Indian Hotels, worth Rs 144 crore, Rs 140 crore, and Rs 114 crore, respectively. Conversely, they have reduced their holdings in Axis Bank, Bharat Forge, and L&T Tech Services by Rs 130 crore, Rs 108 crore, and Rs 107 crore, respectively.

A clear favourite among insurance houses - ITC - gained 4.7 percent in the month of May. For the quarter ended March 2023, ITC reported a 21.4 percent year-on-year growth in standalone net profit at Rs 5,086.9 crore.

Revenue from operations (excluding excise duty) for the company went up 5.6 percent YoY to Rs 16,398 crore from Rs 15,531 crore in the year-ago period. Both topline and bottomline beat analysts' estimates.

Bajaj Finserv and Grasim Industries got the maximum upgrades by brokerages over the past month, while HDFC Bank received the most buy ratings at 41 amid robust quarterly results.

On the other end of the spectrum, Infosys saw the maximum downgrades, triggered by lower-than-expected earnings and a lacklustre outlook.

Sustained momentum in disbursements, healthy interest margins despite rising credit cost and stable asset quality were some of the tailwinds for the BFSI firms, analysts said.

Bajaj Finserv, which posted a 31.4 percent jump in consolidated net profit for the March quarter at Rs 1,769 crore, benefitted from strong growth in the lending business as well as lower provisions.

“Healthy pick-up in lending AUM and selective approach in insurance business coupled with focus on digitisation remain positives,” analysts at ICICI Direct Research said.

Digital transformation, client additions and ambitious targets on AUM growth (25-27 percent CAGR) will further boost profitability, they said, adding that the firm is expected to clock PAT growth of over 21 percent in the next two years.

Bajaj Finserv is a financial conglomerate that holds stakes in the financing business (Bajaj Finance), as well as in the life insurance (Bajaj Life Insurance) and general insurance (Bajaj General Insurance) businesses of the group.

Besides, Bajaj Finserv has received approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for its mutual fund (MF) foray, with analysts saying its extensive distribution network and experience in the financial services space will enable it to tap the growing opportunities in the MF sector.

Grasim Industries, another diversified major with interests in sectors ranging from viscose staple fibre, to chemicals, cement and financial services, was the other stock with the most upgrades.

Grasim owns over 57 percent stake in UltraTech Cement and controls 54 percent of Aditya Birla Capital, besides small stakes in other group companies, giving it a vantage position in the domestic consumption story.

It recently announced its entry in the paints segment with a capex of Rs 10,000 crore.

“In our view, the street is not giving any value to Grasim’s maiden foray into paints business (given it is highly competitive). However, Grasim’s presence in wall-care segment (through subsidiary UltraTech Cement) offers it a fair chance to make its mark in this high growth segment,” ICICI Securities said.

“Success in paints business can drive up significant valuation re-rating over the next 2-3 years. Similarly, its foray into B2B e-commerce (mainly to trade in building materials), too, has not been ascribed any value,” the brokerage added.

However, April’s star performer was HDFC Bank with 41 ‘buy’ ratings, only 1 ‘hold’ call and zero ‘sell’ recommendations.

The country’s largest private sector bank reported a 21 percent jump in consolidated Q4 net profit at Rs 12,594.5 crore on the back of a healthy growth in revenues, net interest margins and disbursements in the retail and commercial segments.

Global broking firm Bernstein said the lender's Q4 FY23 performance met expectations and it is prepared for the HDFC merger.

HDFC Bank expects to complete its reverse merger with parent Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd (HDFC) by July this year.

Earlier in April, it received some regulatory leeway from the RBI with respect to priority sector lending (PSL) norms for the merged entity, removing a big overhang on the stock.

Performance Pain

Infosys shocked the Street with Q4 numbers which were way below expectations, setting off an avalanche of ‘sell’ ratings by brokerages.

The company was jolted by project cancellations, margin contraction and slowing order inflows triggered by the banking crisis in the US – the bread-and-butter market for India’s software services industry.

The Bengaluru-headquartered firm guided for revenue growth of just 4-7 per cent in 2023-24 (in constant currency terms). For context, its earlier guidance stood at 13-15 percent (for FY23) and 12-14 percent (FY22).

“The guidance bakes in an ambitious ask rate of 1.6-2.7 percent CQGR, which appears uncharacteristically H2 FY24 heavy. The company is prone to subsequent downgrades,” analysts at JPMorgan said.

The change in sentiment on discretionary spending in the US and other regions was a key highlight, with market watchers saying this will have medium-term implications not just for Infosys but smaller IT companies as well.

The other company which bore the brunt of a slowdown in global markets was Bajaj Auto.

Despite the two-wheeler company delivering an around 11 percent growth in both Q4 net profit (Rs 1,704.74 crore) and revenue (Rs 8,929.23 crore) – slightly better than estimates, a sharp drop in exports unnerved the Street.

Bajaj Auto’s exports skidded 41 percent year-on-year in the March quarter and 27 percent for the entire fiscal 2023 due to weak macro conditions and low availability of dollars.

“The domestic motorcycle industry continues to see demand weakness and management is now guiding for 6-8 percent volume growth over next few quarters for the industry,” HDFC Securities said.

Lacklustre domestic demand, led by weak recovery in the rural segment, and challenges on the export front also affected its peer Hero MotoCorp, which matched Infosys in terms of the most ‘sell’ ratings in April (9 each).

Hero MotoCorp, the country's largest two-wheeler maker, posted a 5 percent y-o-y dip in total wholesales (shipments to dealers) in April at 3,96,107 units. However, exports more than halved to 9,923 units from 20,132 units in the year-ago period.

“The company expects the momentum to build up in the coming months on account of a combination of multiple factors, including a slew of new product launches, healthy growth in the country's GDP and positive consumer sentiments,” Hero MotoCorp said in a statement.

Analysts, however, added that the traditional two-wheeler players face a stern challenge in the fast-growing EV space which is dominated by the likes of Ola Electric, Okinawa, Ampere, and Ather Energy.

Quarterly Scorecard

Bajaj Finserv, Grasim and HDFC Bank again dominated the list of companies which saw the highest number of upgrades over the past quarter.

A key addition in the mix was Bharti Airtel, which is seeing a turnaround in narrative as the telecom market transitions to the 5G era.

Analysts maintain the worst is over for the sector now.

“The single-biggest disappointment for Bharti since FY10 has been its inability to generate healthy FCF (free cash flow). It has barely registered any FCF after interest payments, which has capped value creation for shareholders through dividends, buybacks or simple net-debt-reduction, which boost equity value,” ICICI Securities said.

The major factors that adversely impacted FCF generation were competitive intensity in the telecom sector, investments needed to augment spectrum portfolio and AGR dues and penalties.

However, as the industry has now consolidated into a three-player market, the scenario is set to change. Moreover, with Vodafone Idea facing a risk to its ‘going concern’ status, an effective duopoly may be in the works.

Global brokerage Jefferies believes Vodafone Idea may potentially be able to secure incremental funding given government's support but this is unlikely to match Bharti Airtel and Jio's capex plans of $9 billion and $25 billion over the next three years.

""Initials signs are already visible in recent market share trends where in VIL has lost 3 percentage points market share in metro circles in Q3 FY23. As per calculations, Bharti Airtel's fair value could rise by Rs120 per share in a duopoly,"" it said in a research note.

Bharti Airtel has also started taking large tariff interventions supporting revenue growth, and has built a very large spectrum portfolio across technologies, which should aid in its 5G rollout.

“Bharti’s cashflow will also benefit from steady growth in non-mobile services including FTTH and enterprise. Dividends from Airtel Africa and Indus will add to India FCF generation. Spectrum moratorium is due to end in FY26 and this will increase cash outflow towards government payment from FY27,” ICICI Securities added.

No such worries for Titan, which continued to remain a market favourite due to its continued momentum and long runway for future growth.

Titan has come a long way from pioneering in just branded wrist watches to carving a place for itself in segments like jewellery, wearables, fragrances, eyewear and accessories.

“Titan has ample opportunities for growth, given its market share of sub-10% in jewellery and the ongoing challenges faced by its unorganized and organized peers. Its medium-to-long-term earnings growth potential is unparalleled,” analysts at Motilal Oswal said.

In contrast, Infosys once again topped the list of companies with the highest number of downgrades over the past quarter, followed by HDFC Life Insurance.

HDFC Life Insurance suffered from the aftershocks of the Union Budget proposals on taxing proceeds of insurance policies with premiums in excess of Rs 5 lakh and introduction of the new tax regime, which removes almost all exemptions.

The company also reported an almost flat net profit of Rs 359 crore for the fourth quarter of FY23, as against Rs 357 crore last year, even though net premium income increased 36 percent to Rs 19,426 crore.

“HDFC Life’s share price has underperformed in the past three years. Focus is expected to shift towards protection and annuity business but sustainability of margins along with healthy premium growth needs to be watched,” ICICI Direct Research pointed out.

In absolute terms, however, the company which received the most ‘sell’ ratings over the past quarter was Divi’s Laboratories.

Revenue collapse following abatement of COVID-19 conditions, no clear visibility of a significant recovery in growth or profitability in the near term and elevated valuations are major headwinds for the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) manufacturer.

Yearly Trends

Market heavyweight Reliance Industries had the maximum upgrades over the past year, with 33 ‘buy’ calls compared to 26 a year ago.

The oil-to-telecom conglomerate beat estimates with a 19 percent jump in net profit attributable to the owners of the company at Rs 19,299 crore for the March quarter of 2022-23.

Gross revenue from operations of India's most valued company came in at Rs 2.39 lakh crore, registering a year-on-year rise of 2.8 percent.

Goldman Sachs said the sequential earnings growth was led by the O2C segment on stronger gross refining margins (GRMs), and falling petchem earnings turned into a tailwind with the correction in feedstock US ethane and LPG.

The firm noted that retail continued to gain market share, with grocery revenue driven by rapid store expansion.

The capex rose to $17.6 billion in FY23 but was fully funded by cash profits. The net debt to EBITDA is well below 1x in FY23.

Many analysts said the capex/debt commentary was positive and the company's comments on disciplined capital allocation and maintaining net debt/EBITDA below 1x should assuage investor concerns on leverage.

Cigarette-to-soap maker ITC too posted better-than-expected Q4 numbers, leading to a host of positive brokerage commentary.

""With per capita consumption 1/18th of China’s, the cigarette opportunity in India remains attractive. However, with cig still contributing 85 percent to EBIT, reliance on regulated business remains high,"" Edelweiss said in a report.

The stock is trading at a discount to its Indian FMCG peers at 28.6 times its estimated earnings for FY19, and 25.2 times its estimated earnings for FY20. However, it is trading at a premium to global cigarette majors.

The domestic consumption story also boosted other names like Titan, Nestle India and HDFC Bank.

But bad tidings continued to stalk Divi’s Laboratories, which saw the most downgrades over the past year, followed by JSW Steel at 17 ‘sell’, 8 ‘hold’ and 7 ‘buy’ calls.

However, it was Wipro which emerged as the firm with the maximum number of ‘sell’ calls over the past year.

The company disappointed analysts with a 0.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in consolidated net profit for the March quarter at Rs 3,075 crore and guided for muted 1H FY24.

Motilal Oswal expects FY24 organic growth to be one of the lowest among Tier-1 IT services peers, with margins below the management’s medium-term guided range of 17.0-17.5 percent.

After a subdued performance in February, the domestic equity market went into standstill mode in March. The sudden collapse of three US banks along with the crisis at the storied Credit Suisse triggered alarm among investors over the health of the global banking system, pushing them away from risky asset classes like equities.

On top of that, relentless selling by foreign institutional investors kept the market in a narrow range through the month. Lack of positive domestic cues only added to the negative sentiment. The quantum of contrarian calls also remained muted for March due to an absence of stock-specific cues. A contrarian call is when an analyst recommends buying a stock although its price is falling, or the other way round.

Tech Mahindra, Asian Paints and Tata Steel were among the few stocks that saw some divergence between price action and analyst action through March even amid high volatility.

Shares of Tech Mahindra slipped 2.39 percent over the month as investors chose to book profits in a period of high uncertainty. However, a rejig of the company's management garnered favour from analysts. As per Moneycontrol's Analysts' Call Tracker, ""buy"" calls for the information technology company rose to 25 from the earlier 21 as one ""hold"" and three ""sell"" calls were reduced.

Tech Mahindra recently declared that Mohit Joshi will take over as managing director and chief executive officer-designate, succeeding CP Gurnani, who is scheduled to retire in December 2023. Joshi comes with a strong pedigree as he previously served as president for BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) and healthcare at Infosys.

""Mohit Joshi, the incoming CEO-designate at Tech Mahindra, ticks most of the boxes to lead another turnaround, in our view. His deep client relationships in the BFSI space will help shore up Tech Mahindra's relatively sub-scale BFSI practice, especially in the developed markets. His large deal credentials could help improve the IT company's large deal win-rates,"" analysts at JM Financial Services wrote in a note. The broking firm also upgraded the stock to ""hold"" from ""sell"" on that account, along with an increase of 21.8 percent in its target price to Rs 1,170.

Emkay Global Financial Services also backed the view and feels Joshi's selection gives more credence to the company's overall turnaround efforts and the stock may potentially see a rerating. The brokerage firm has a ""buy"" recommendation for Tech Mahindra, with a target price of Rs 1,270.

Yet, even with the optimism seen for the stock over March, it is also important to note that Tech Mahindra is among the few names that saw contrarian downgrades over the quarter. During that period, ""buy"" calls for the company went down to 25 from the earlier 26 while ""hold"" ratings rose to 14 from 12.

Such a divergence between monthly and quarterly contrarian calls is on two accounts. The stock has risen around 8 percent over the quarter, but fell 2.39 percent in March. In addition to that, some analysts are yet to gain confidence that the management will actually turn things around for the IT giant.

""Tech Mahindra has underperformed its peers over the last 6-12 months both in terms of topline as well as earnings growth and stock performance. While its performance has been sub-par over this period, the matter of most speculation has been the appointment of the succeeding CEO—which has now been put to rest. Hereafter, the stock price movement would be determined by earnings growth trajectory, which would take time to resurrect, in our view, given structural changes the business requires to be able to compete with peers,"" Nuvama Institutional Equities wrote in its note.

However, the broking firm does not anticipate a steep downside for Tech Mahindra either as it believes its inexpensive valuation and high dividend yield limit its downside potential.

Among contrarian downgrades over the past month, no significant divergence in price and analyst action was seen in the past month. Even though two banking bellwethers, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, saw ""buy"" recommendations reduce by one and two, respectively, it was because the number brokerages covering the stocks had reduced. Fundamentally, no major developments were announced by the banks and their growth stories remain intact. A total of 50 brokerages out of the 52 covering ICICI Bank have a ""buy"" call for the lender. As for HDFC Bank, 40 of the total 43 maintain a ""buy"" rating.

Quarter-on-quarter changes

On a quarterly basis, HCL Technologies and Dr Reddy's Laboratories were two major players that witnessed contrasting price and analyst action. HCL Technologies saw its ""buy"" calls reduce to 26 from 30, while the stock gained 4.69 percent.

JPMorgan has cited high near-term risks for HCL Technologies and anticipates its earnings for the fourth quarter to disappoint analyst expectations. The global research and broking firm also has a cautious stance on the overall IT sector and foresees potential downside risks to earnings and multiples due to weak fourth-quarter prints and FY24 guidance.

Also Read: Analyst Call Tracker: Why are analysts lowering expectations from HCL Technologies?

ICICI Securities, which has a ""hold"" rating for HCL Tech, predicts that the company's results will be the weakest in their coverage universe in terms of constant currency sequential growth, at a decline of 1.9 percent, due to weak seasonality in the product and platform business.

As for Dr Reddy's Laboratories, pessimism for the stock stems from concerns of price trends in the US market. Global research and broking firm Jefferies also sees lower-than-expected growth in the US market and lower sales of the generic version of multiple myeloma drug Revlimid as the major downside risks for the stock.

According to Nuvama Institutional Equities, which has given the stock a ""hold"" rating, the acquisition of Mayne Pharma's US retail generics portfolio by the drugmaker for $90 million is a low-risk move, but it will not significantly benefit the company.

Nuvama also pointed out that Dr Reddy's growth in the US, excluding generic-Revlimid, will face challenges in terms of implementation due to price erosion and competition in the market for existing molecules.

Dr Reddy's Laboratories witnessed a similar trend in the yearly period as well, with downgrades for the stock rising along with positive price action.

In terms of contrarian upgrades over the quarter, Bajaj Finserv emerged as the clear winner as ""buy"" ratings rose to six from five and ""sell"" calls reduced by one alongside an 18.5 percent correction in stock price. It is the non-banking financial company's strong growth outlook that is driving analysts' optimism for the stock.

ShareKhan by BNP Paribas is of the view that the company's digital initiatives will help Bajaj Finserv achieve the next growth stage, emphasising continuous innovation. ""We believe strong growth in the lending business and an improving outlook for both the insurance businesses will likely act as a positive trigger for strong consolidated earnings going forward,"" the broking firm highlighted in its note.

Year-on-year changes

Apart from Dr Reddy's, another stock that saw its ""buy"" calls reduce over the year despite positive price action was Coal India. Investors poured money into the stock on the back of its robust earnings, which reaped the benefits of increased e-auction premiums.

Emkay Global Financial Services sees Coal India as a value trap. ""Coal India utilizes a large part of its operating cash flows as capex, yet both volume and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) growths are low. Just for maintaining production at current level, Coal India needs to make continual heavy investments for land acquisition, rehabilitation, equipment and machinery,"" the firm said in its note.

Analysts at Emkay Global also believe that even though Coal India appears to be a value-pick based on traditional valuation metrics, its 'cheap' valuation is an illusion in their view as these conventional valuation metrics are not applicable to a company that needs to invest sizeable amounts of operating cash flow every year just for maintaining its level of production. ""We, thus, believe that Coal India is a value trap,"" the firm noted. Emkay Global makes up one of the total five ""sell"" calls for the scrip.

As far as contrarian upgrades over the year are concerned, index heavyweight Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) showed a remarkable contrast in price and analyst action. ""Buy"" recommendations jumped to 32 from the earlier 23 while both ""sell"" and ""hold"" calls reduced by two and eight, respectively.

Brokerages see a favourable risk-reward emerging out of RIL, especially on the back of its 11.34 percent slide over the past year on the back of concerns over high capital expenditure and, consequently, rising debt.

""Though high capex is a near-term worry, we reiterate our high-conviction ‘Buy’ rating on RIL with a target price of Rs 2,000 per share, given its industry leading capabilities across businesses, which is likely to drive robust 13-15 percent EPS CAGR (Compounded annual growth rate) over the next three-five years,"" wrote analysts at broking firm JM Financial Services.

Jefferies also took note of the favourable risk reward and raised its target price for RIL to Rs 2,872, in order to reflect an upside potential of over 23 percent from Monday's closing price.",1535,0.03352980039737843

The stock touched a high of Rs 1,401, which was 3.39 per cent higher than the previous close of Rs 1,355.2. It was trading at around Rs 1,386, or 2.33 percent higher than its previous close, at 12.13 noon on BSE on March 6.

A few days ago, the financial services company got the market regulator’s approval to start a mutual-fund business. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) granted a certificate of registration to Bajaj Finserv Mutual Fund (BFMF) and also granted approval for Bajaj Finserv Asset Management Limited to act as an asset management company for BFMF, stated a filing at the exchange.

Positive sentiment around the stock has been building for over a month now, following a strong quarterly performance. The company’s net profit surged 42 percent YoY to Rs 1,782 crore.

In Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for February, the stock registered maximum upgrades over January. That is the percentage increase of ‘buy’ calls on the stock by market analysts was the highest. Buy calls had gone up to 6 in February from 5 in January and ‘sell’ calls had fallen to 1 from 2. In all, the stock saw an 11.1 per cent upgrade, month-on-month.

Analysts sound confident about the company’s various business verticals. IIFL’s analysts, in their October 2022 report, in which they had given an ‘add’ call with a price target of Rs 1,720 for the stock, noted that the company’s insurance business was “firing on all cylinders” and that its “investments in finance (Bajaj Market) and health (Finserv Health) would create extensions that would be value accretive over the next decade”.

Sharekhan, which has a ‘buy’ call on the stock, pointed to the company’s improving profitability and product mix. Analysts said that in the general insurance business, the company is focusing on profitability and generating sustainable RoE; while its life-insurance business is growing stronger on its existing product mix and new launches. This improving outlook for the insurance business, along with strong growth in the lending business, is what the analysts believed will act as a “positive trigger for strong consolidated earnings going forward”.",412,0.9991047084331512

HDFC Life Insurance received the most number of downgrades last month, while peer Bajaj Finserv got the most upgrades. What caused the divergence?

The insurance sector took a hit last month when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed in her budget taxation of high-value policies (excluding unit-linked products) with an annual premium of over Rs 5 lakh.

HDFC Life Insurance was hit particularly hard because it has a higher share (over 10 percent) of the business of non-unit-linked policies with an annual premium of over Rs 5 lakh than its peers. The company’s stock price has tanked 15 percent since then.

According to Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities, “[HDFC Life has a] very high dependence on a product which may go out of fashion or may have to be revamped or relaunched based on the new budget proposals.”

The company was the most expensive insurance stock, which could have also led to increased downgrades, he added.

Diverse offerings

Why wasn’t Bajaj Finserv impacted as much, with analysts having just the opposite sentiment?

While the budget proposal was certainly a “dampener,” as Bajaj Allianz Life’s CEO Tarun Chugh called it, the optimism stems from Bajaj Finserv’s interests beyond insurance.

“Bajaj Finserv is a more diversified business,” said Abhay Agarwal, founder of Piper Serica Advisors, a portfolio management services firm. “It has more than 50 percent shareholding in Bajaj Finance that is its biggest value driver and then it has a very wide business portfolio. It has life insurance, it also does non-life insurance. It has just got its mutual fund licence. So it has a very varied portfolio compared to HDFC Life, where only the life insurance business is there and even that is under pressure now.”

Bajaj Finserv holds 52.49 percent in Bajaj Finance. While it offers insurance through Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance and General Insurance subsidiaries, it also offers other financial services including lending (Bajaj Finance), and asset and wealth management (Bajaj Finserv Asset Management).

The company received a regulatory license to start its mutual fund business on March 2. Bajaj Finserv said it now offers the full range of financial services for customers through their lifecycle.

“Healthy pick-up in lending assets under management and selective approach in insurance business coupled with a focus on digitisation remain positive,” ICICI Direct said about Bajaj Finserv.

Bajaj Finance itself was the street’s favourite, with the highest upgrades by analysts over the last quarter.

“The company’s digital initiatives and business transformation are key positives and are currently progressing well,” said Axis Securities. The digital transformation is likely to be completed by FY23 and is expected to make a meaningful contribution to overall growth, it added.

Bajaj Finserv shares gained 0.71 percent to Rs 1,353.05 at the close on the National Stock Exchange on March 3. Bajaj Finance added 0.18 percent to Rs 6,094 and HDFC Life climbed 1.52 percent to Rs 490.15.",535,0.2651890118916829

Strong quarterly performance which saw a 42 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,782 crore contributed to the high upgrades over the month for Bajaj Finserv.

Brokerage Sharekhan, has given the company a buy rating with an upside potential of 23 percent over yesterday's closing price, and believes the company’s digital initiatives will drive growth.

“For the general insurance business, the company is focusing on profitability and generating sustainable RoE (return on equity) while pursuing sustainable premium growth which is a key positive. The life insurance business is growing stronger due to its focus on a balanced product mix and new product launches. We believe strong growth in the lending business and an improving outlook for both the insurance businesses will likely act as a positive trigger for strong consolidated earnings going forward,” analysts at the firm said in a note.

Adani Ports, which saw a strong sell-off triggered by the negative report by US-based Hindenburg Research on the group, did not however lose favour among analysts, who gave buy recommendations on the basis of the company’s strong business outlook and positive cash flows.

Adani Ports may generate a cumulative operating cash flow of Rs 26,100 crore in FY24-25 with a capital expenditure of Rs 12,000 crore, resulting in Rs 14,000 crore of free cash flow, substantially higher than its debt-repayment obligations of Rs 11,000 crore, as per JM Financial. The brokerage sees a 35 percent upside at a target price of Rs 800 and expects Adani Ports to remain the market leader in India with volume growth of 16 percent, translating into revenue growth of 15 percent, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) growth of 15 percent and PAT (profit after tax) growth of 13 percent, compounded annually over FY23-25E.

HDFC Life Insurance got the maximum downgrades in February, followed by Divi’s Laboratories and Grasim Industries.

The budget proposal to tax income from high-value insurance policies (excluding unit-linked products) having premiums of over Rs 5 lakh annually has weighed in on HDFC Life, with its share price tanking around 20 percent since. HDFC Life’s share of the business of non-unit-linked policies with an annual premium of above Rs 5 lakh is over 10 per cent.

According to Phillip Capital, “HDFC Life will be the most impacted, given a higher share of single-premium product (Sanchay Fixed Maturity Plan), which constitutes around 20-25 percent of NPAR (non-participating insurance plan) APE (annualised premium equivalent),” said analysts at Phillip Capital.

A single-premium product or policy carries a large-ticket premium as it is paid through a single, upfront lump sum payment while a non-participating insurance plan is one with a guaranteed payout at maturity.

“(HDFC Life has a) very high dependence on a product which may go out of fashion or may have to be revamped or relaunched based on the new budget proposals,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research, HDFC Securities. He added that the company was the most expensive insurance stock compared to peers, which could have also led to high downgrades.

While poor performance for the last couple of quarters has resulted in high downgrades for Divi’s, the mixed outlook towards the pharma sector, in general, has also led to the inclusion of names like Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries in the list of top 10 downgrades last month.

“There are multiple pressures, one is on non-branded generic exports which is the weakest segment of the market. There is absolutely no pricing power, in fact, just to get the volumes going, these companies are selling at either cost or even below cost. So till there is price recovery in non-branded generics, which is still a fair part of all these companies’ business, that pressure will continue. The second is that while there is a reduction in input prices, margin pressure still exists, so it’s not like they are going to benefit. So I think the non-branded generics business is what is going to keep pressures on these companies for a fair bit of time till we see price recovery there.” said Abhay Agarwal, Founder of Piper Serica Advisors, a portfolio management services firm.

Quarterly upgrades, downgrades

Bajaj Finance topped the list for the highest upgrades over the past quarter followed by Bajaj Finserv and Adani Ports.

Bajaj Finance’s move towards digital transformation to increase growth in client acquisition as well as assets under management has made analysts more confident about its business model.

“Omnipresence strategy and organic momentum building up offer comfort on growth sustainability. We revise target price to Rs 7,250 from Rs 8,650 keeping multiple at ~5.7x FY25E ABV,” said ICICI Direct analysts.

Brokerage firm IIFL believes that Bajaj Finance is building an ecosystem to preserve customer cohorts across various businesses. With its fintech platform and health-tech platform, customers may not have to look around for products that Bajaj Finance doesn’t offer directly, it said.

With all its offerings under one digital umbrella, Bajaj finance is better positioned in terms of customer acquisition, engagement as well opportunities to cross-sell.

Among the top 10 companies with the maximum upgrades over a quarter, Bajaj Auto saw the highest number of buy ratings, rising to 34 versus 31 a quarter ago. The general uptrend in the auto sector along with its resilient performance in the face of global macro challenges had analysts upbeat on the stock.

Tech Mahindra, Divi’s Labs and HDFC Life were among the companies with the highest number of downgrades over the past quarter.

The number of hold ratings on Tech Mahindra’s stock increased to 15 this quarter from 11 a quarter ago, while buy ratings dropped to 21 from 29. Motilal Oswal, which has a neutral rating on the stock, said that near-term growth remains weak and they are waiting for more comfort in margins.

“Although its current performance remains muted, the company's high exposure to the communications vertical offers a potential opportunity, as a broader 5G rollout can result in a new spending cycle in this space,” it added.

Maximum upgrades, downgrades over past year

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) had the maximum upgrades over last year, with 32 buy calls compared to 23 a year ago. The hold calls on the company’s stock have also shrunk from 11 to 2.

The company is firing on all cylinders, said research firm Antique Stock Broking in its initiating coverage on RIL.

“While O2C (oil-to-chemicals) will benefit from the ‘platinum age of refining’, telecom is set to ride the 5G transition with significant tariff increase tailwind, robust growth in retail from aggressive investments so far, and the gas production growth driving earnings of oil and gas segment,” the brokerage said, adding that it saw an upside of 25 percent at a target price of Rs 2,900 apiece.

The O2C business stoked optimism in the light of earnings growth as well as refining margin recovery. The sector is further expected to do well with the International Energy Agency saying that oil demand will hit a record in CY23 and grow by 2 million barrels per day year-on-year.

ITC, Titan and Bajaj Finance followed RIL in terms of the most upgrades over the past year.

ITC’s stock witnessed its buy ratings increase to 35 compared to 27 a year ago on the back of consistently improving financial performance reported in the last few quarters. In its latest quarter, ITC reported a 21 percent annualized increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 5,031 crore.

“We expect the strong business growth momentum to continue across divisions. In cigarettes, we believe a pragmatic tax regime not only acts as fodder for illicit volume growth but also increases its predictability premium. We expect FMCG, hotels and paperboard to continue to witness improvement in business and margins supported by new launches and reach expansion. We increase FY23F-25F EPS by +2-3 percent to factor in the 3Q23 beat,” Nomura said in its research note.

Analysts at Motilal Oswal believe that ITC is still trading at a 15 percent discount to its January 2019 valuations of 25.4 times one-year forward earnings per share, even though valuations of ITC’s global tobacco peers have been restored to their pre-Covid levels.

“The stock has gained 45 percent since our upgrade to Buy call in Jun 2022 and we believe there is further scope for upside based on its healthy earnings outlook,” they said.

Divi’s Laboratories got the maximum downgrades in the last year followed by JSW Steel and Tech Mahindra, while Wipro saw the highest number of hold ratings at 17.

For JSW Steel the high debt had analysts doubting its steep valuation with many not seeing any upside in the stock price.

Tech Mahindra and Wipro seem to have borne the brunt of the slowdown in the IT sector in the last year of Tech Mahindra and Wipro have declined 22 percent and 32 percent, respectively, in the last year.",1510,0.5058347071920123

2023-02-09 17:46:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/analyst-call-tracker-bajaj-finserv-tops-with-most-upgrades-hdfc-life-most-downgraded-in-past-month-10041471.html,"Bajaj Finserv, Tata Motors and Bajaj Finance got the maximum upgrades by brokerages over the past month, while HDFC Bank received the highest number of buy ratings at 42, up from 38 last month.

Strong earnings growth has driven the momentum in the BFSI (banking, financial services, and insurance) and auto sectors in the third quarter of FY23, analysts said.

In a recent earnings review report by Motilal Oswal, automobiles, public sector banks, and non-banking financial companies recorded an FY24E earnings upgrade of 7 percent.

“The 3QFY23 corporate earnings so far have been in line with the performance of heavyweights driving the aggregate. However, the growth has been led by just BFSI and autos while metals, oil & gas and cement have recorded a YoY earnings decline for the quarter,” the brokerage noted.

For Tata Motors, analysts at Motilal Oswal said all three businesses of the company are in recovery mode. While the India commercial vehicle business will see a cyclical recovery, the India passenger vehicle segment is in a structural recovery mode, the brokerage said.

JLR (Jaguar Land Rover) is also witnessing a cyclical recovery, supported by a favourable product mix, however supply-side issues will defer the recovery process, it added.

Global brokerage CLSA gave Tata Motors an upgrade after its JLR division reported higher wholesale volumes in the October-December quarter amid gradual improvement in chip supplies.

HDFC Life Insurance Company got the maximum downgrades over the past one month, followed by Divi’s Laboratories and HCL Technologies.

The HDFC Life downgrades seem to stem from the impact of the Union Budget 2023, in which finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed to limit income tax exemption from proceeds of high-value insurance policies.

“HDFC Life will be the most impacted, given a higher share of single-premium product (Sanchay Fixed Maturity Plan), which constitutes around 20-25 percent of NPA (non-participating insurance plan) APE (annualised premium equivalent),” said Phillip Capital.

Divi’s Lab posted its lowest operating profit margin during the December quarter. Analysts are concerned over high input cost pressures and a moderate outlook of pick-up in non-Covid opportunities.

Quarterly upgrades, downgrades

Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Auto got the highest number of upgrades over the past quarter.

The digital transformation led by Bajaj Finance, a subsidiary of Bajaj Finserv, seems to be driving growth, with increases in client additions as well as assets under management.

According to brokerage firm IIFL, Bajaj Finance intends to build an ecosystem that will preserve the customer cohort across various businesses. With its fintech platform and health-tech platform, customers may not have to look around for products that Bajaj Finance doesn’t offer directly.

Bajaj Finance will also start its mutual fund business later this year, it said.

“Insurance businesses are firing on all cylinders. Investments in finance and health platforms would create extensions that would be value accretive over the next decade,” the brokerage said.

Among the top 10 companies with the maximum upgrades over a quarter, HDFC Bank had the highest number of ‘buy’ ratings at 42, followed by Bajaj Auto at 35.

“HDFC Bank remains one of the few banks to clock a strong deposit growth amid rising competition for deposits,” said analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services. “On the credit front, HDFC Bank remains opportunistic on the corporate side; thus, we are not too worried about the Q3 growth moderation. The bank continues to clock strong growth in the retail/SME segment which we believe should support its margins amid rising cost pressure.”

On the other hand, Bajaj Finserv had the lowest number of ‘buy’ recommendations, at six.

Tech Mahindra, HDFC Life and Divi’s Laboratories were among the companies with the highest number of downgrades over the past quarter.

The number of ‘hold’ ratings on Tech Mahindra’s stock increased to 13 this quarter from 10 a quarter ago.

‘Hold’ ratings on HCL Technologies increased to 16 from 12 a quarter ago.

Low discretionary tech spending coupled with macro challenges in the west may contribute to a negative outlook for tech stocks. Analysts at Credit Suisse expect India's top four Indian IT companies to witness a 10-27 percent valuation-led correction, with HCL Tech likely to be the worst hit.

Maximum upgrades, downgrades over past year

UltraTech Cement had the maximum upgrades, with 42 ‘buy’ calls from 37 a year ago. Last year, there were seven ‘hold’ calls on the company’s stock, which have shrunk to two now.

Analysts like UltraTech’s ability to maintain its market position and cope with the industry's inherent cyclicality. Strong branding and focus on capacity building to target long-term growth opportunities have also been positives.

ITC, Power Grid Corporation of India and HDFC Life followed UltraTech in terms of the most upgrades over the past year.

JSW Steel got the maximum downgrades. From 19 ‘buy’ recommendations a year ago, the stock slipped to six ‘buy’ calls, even as ‘sell’ ratings soared to 19 from seven a year ago. Analysts said JSW Steel’s high valuation provides limited upside potential.

“Despite margin recovery in sight, due to steep valuation, we downgrade JSTL to Sell rating with target price of Rs 688,” Centrum Broking said.

‘Buy’ calls on Tech Mahindra fell to 22 from 43 last year, and ‘sell’ ratings jumped to eight from one. Analysts said the muted business momentum in the Indian IT sector and pressure on margins led to the downgrade.

Divi’s Laboratories, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, and HCL Technologies were the other stocks with extreme downgrades over the past year.",908,0.21128258497818656

The market recouped more than half of its previous week's losses and climbed 250 points or 1.4 percent on the Nifty50 during the week ended February 3. The recovery is largely attributed to the short covering-led buying in beaten-down banking and financial services and select Adani Group stocks along with fall in oil prices.

The Nifty50 finally settled above the 17,800 mark, the lower band of previous trading range (17,800-18,250) seen before the recent correction, after taking strong support at 200 DMA (around 17,300).

In the near term, the index is expected to take support at 17,600, which has been holding quite well on every closing in the past six consecutive sessions, with resistance at the 18,000-18,250 zone but, considering the recent news-led activity, further volatility can't be ruled out, experts said.

""Although we managed to recover the lost ground this week, we are not completely out of the woods yet. A continuous news flow with respect to the Adani group is likely to give volatile swings on both sides,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

As far as the levels are concerned, he feels, the immediate support is visible around 17,600; but the major sacrosanct zone remains at 17,400 – 17,300, which coincides with the 200-day SMA. ""Ideally, till the time we defend this, there is no real reason to worry for,"" Chavan said.

On the flipside, if the market has to regain its pride, the Nifty needs to surpass 18,000 – 18,100 on a closing basis, which will confirm the completion of the recent corrective phase and market can then resume the higher degree uptrend, the expert said.

He advised that the banking space needs to be watched closely because it is likely to act as a catalyst for setting the near-term direction for the market. Apart from this, a lot of thematic moves started playing out well towards the end of the week. One must keep focusing on such potential trading opportunities, he said.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the February 3 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Bajaj Finserv: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,337 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,240 | Target: Rs 1,500 | Return: 12 percent

The stock spent a lot of time between the Rs 1,800 and Rs 1,600 levels during September and November 2022. However, since the stock has broken the trading range at Rs 1,600, we saw a significant fall in the stock towards Rs 1,246 level without any meaningful pullback. The pullback has sent the stock into the highly oversold zone.

Technically, such a pattern could result in a move back to retrace the sell-off. Based on it, the positional traders should be buyers at the current levels with a final stop-loss at Rs 1,240. On the upside, it will find resistance at Rs 1,450 or Rs 1,500.

ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 381 | Stop-Loss: Rs 350 | Target: Rs 440 | Return: 15 percent

We saw unusual movement in stock after the announcement of the budget. On the same day, it kept fluctuating between Rs 366 and Rs 329 levels, however, it managed to close at the highest point of the day. The stock broke the broad trading range at Rs 366 and closed above it on a weekly closing basis, which is positive for the long-term trend of the stock.

Technically, it has the potential to move to the next extension levels, which are Rs 400 and Rs 440. On the flip side, Rs 370 and Rs 360 should be support areas for the stock to accumulate. From a medium-term perspective, buy ITC with a stop-loss at Rs 350.

Mahindra Lifespace Developers: Buy | LTP: Rs 380 | Stop-Loss: Rs 340 | Target: Rs 460 | Return: 21 percent

From September 2022, the stock was in a vertical fall from highs of Rs 550, it fell to Rs 350 levels. However, after hitting Rs 350 levels, the stock saw a lot of volume-based activity between Rs 340 and Rs 380 levels.

Technically, the stock has fallen towards the key support area and based on the price and volume expansion, our strategy should be to buy from a medium to long-term perspective. Keep the final stop-loss at Rs 340 for all trading positions. On the upside, we can see Rs 420 or Rs 460 levels.

Expert: Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

With the stock indices touching a new high, the earnings growth for Nifty 50 index constituents will taper to 21.2 percent in FY24 from 22.9 percent expected for FY23, according to Bloomberg consensus expectations.

The decline is mainly due to an expanded base and slowing of export revenue amid fears of a recession that could affect demand.

However, the performance of the energy sector, which is closely linked to crude oil prices, will hold the key, said Mayuresh Joshi, head of equity research at William O’Neil & Co.

Controlled inflation, a peaked out bad-loan cycle and good agricultural output will lend some support to the Nifty 50, said G Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics Research.

Bajaj Finserv, Bharti Airtel, Axis Bank, Adani Enterprises and Tata Motors are likely to be the biggest contributors to EPS growth in the Nifty 50 index in FY24, according to a Moneycontrol analysis.

A real turnaround in EPS growth is expected in Axis Bank and Tata Motors, according to Bloomberg data. On the other hand, EPS growth is narrowing for Bharti Airtel and Adani Enterprises.

How the valuations stack up:

According to Bloomberg, the Nifty Index’s PE is expected to contract to 19.2 times in FY24 from 22.9 times in FY23 mainly on account of higher earnings for the next financial year.



According to Gautam Duggad, head of research – institutional equities at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, the Nifty price to earnings for the next 12 months at 20x is well within the 10-year average of 19.6 times because earnings have caught up while the markets were little changed for the past 12 months.

With earnings growth of 16-17 percent for FY24, the markets should, by and large, reflect underlying earnings without much de-rating/re-rating.

On a granular basis, Axis Bank and Adani Enterprises are trading at higher valuations than their 10-year average, while Bharti Airtel, ONGC and Tata Motors are trading at steeper discounts.",320,0.6298490464687347

Bulls kept the market charged up last week, despite some volatility because of global factors, and pushed Nifty50 firm up above the psychological 18,000 mark with support at 17,900. After recent policy meetings, volatility too cooled down considerably to below 16 levels, giving more headroom to bulls.

The 50-share NSE benchmark gained nearly 2 percent during the week ended November 4 to settle at 18,117 on Friday with all sectors participating in the rally.

The Nifty50 traded firmly above all important exponential moving averages, and maintained higher high higher lows for the third straight week.

If the upbeat momentum sustaining, this week, though a truncated one because of Gurunanak Jayanti on November 8, may see the index may marching towards its last week's high of 18,178, followed by 18,350 (the high of 2022). If the index manages to sustain these levels then a record high of 18,604 can't be ruled out, with strong support at 18,000-17,900 levels, experts said.

""The market posted a weekly close above 18,100 last Friday. This is a clear indication of how strong our markets have been of late. Undoubtedly, the bulls continue with their hegemony in the domestic markets and are eying record highs now,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

If there is no aberration globally, the Nifty is good to go towards 18,250 – 18,350 first and then a march towards previous high of 18,600 looks very much on cards in the ongoing calendar year, he feels.

As far as supports are concerned, 18,000 followed by 17,900 should be treated as sacrosanct zone and any intra-week decline would provide opportunities to create fresh longs.

Sameet advised traders to continue with an optimistic approach and now. ""With other sectors chipping in, we expect a good broad-based buying in the forthcoming week.""

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the November 4 closing prices:

Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

Dalmia Bharat: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,742 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,575 | Target: Rs 2,000 | Return: 15 percent

Dalmia Bharat has corrected from a high of Rs 2,548 touched in September 2021. The stock recently found support around the Rs 1,212 levels in June 2022. This is close to the previous intermediate highs, indicating the change of polarity principle is at work. The stock has subsequently bounced back and made higher bottoms in the last few months.

This week, the stock broke out of a trading range on the back of huge volumes, which is encouraging. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI (relative strength index) too have bounced back and are in rising mode now.

With the intermediate technical setup too looking positive, we believe the stock has the potential to move higher in the coming weeks. We recommend buying the stock between Rs 1,720-1,760 levels, with a stop-loss at 1,575 and target at Rs 2,000.

Inox Leisure: Buy | LTP: Rs 527 | Stop-Loss: Rs 507 | Target: Rs 560 | Return: 6 percent

After correcting from a high of Rs 619 in August 2022, Inox Leisure found support around Rs 475 levels in September 2022. These are strong supports as they are just above the 50-week SMA (simple moving average).

Last week, the stock broke out of a narrow trading range on the back of above average volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50 days SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.

With the intermediate setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 523-529 levels, with a stop-loss of Rs 507 and target of Rs 560.

Muthoot Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,076 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,036 | Target: Rs 1,140 | Return: 6 percent

Muthoot Finance has bounced back from a low of Rs 950 touched in September 2022 where it made a double bottom. The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. Last week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50 days SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and have given positive divergence signals.

With the intermediate setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 1,074-1,078 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,036 and target at Rs 1,140.

Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

Ambuja Cements: Buy | LTP: Rs 559 | Stop-Loss: Rs 524 | Target: Rs 664 | Return: 19 percent

The stock is in the strong up trend, as it bounced after forming multiple bottoms between its 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci Retracement levels of prior up-move (Rs 392-586), which was placed at Rs 489 and Rs 466, respectively.

The stock has potential to move towards its 100 percent Fibonacci Extension level of prior up-move. Its daily RSI gave buy signal after consolidating above its neutral line-50.

In case of any decline, the stock will find support at around its upward sloping 20-day EMA (exponential moving average). Since October 17, the stock remained above that exponential moving average and advanced gradually.

Siemens: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,973 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,760 | Target: Rs 3,320 | Return: 12 percent

On November 4, the stock breached its prior daily falling trend and rose to one-month high. Since October 19, the stock is positively poised above its key moving averages and moved higher thereafter.

We believe undergoing positive momentum will continue and the stock will explore uncharted territory. On the higher side, the stock may face hurdle around its life-time-high of Rs 3,139 before an exponential rise.

However, a stable move above that high level will accelerate undergoing positive momentum. This could lead the stock towards its prior high connecting rising trendline.

On the lower side, the stock will find support at around its intermediate upward sloping trendline.

Bajaj Finserv: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,801 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,724 | Target: Rs 1,932 | Return: 7 percent

After a higher level of reversal, the stock oscillated around its 50-day EMA and witnessed a range breakout subsequently. In the past, the stock respected that exponential moving average and continued its prevailing trend.

As per the current set-up, history may repeat itself, which could take the stock towards its life-time-high of Rs 1,932. Substantial rise in volume and increase in future open interest signals that major market participants are in favour of the bulls.

Its daily RSI is positively poised after a trendline breakout. In case of any decline, as per the change in polarity principle, the stock will find support around its upper band of the range.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

UPL: Buy | LTP: Rs 739 | Stop-Loss: Rs 710 | Target: Rs 790 | Return: 7 percent

The stock is forming a symmetrical triangle on the weekly and daily charts. It is a difficult task for the trader to predict which side of the stock will break the trading range.

However, during the formation process, we can define specific resistance and support areas for stocks based on the boundaries of the formation. Based on it, we are expecting the stock to move towards Rs 770-790 levels in the near term.

It is a buy at current levels and on further dips with a final stop-loss at Rs 710.

Bharat Dynamics: Buy | LTP: Rs 980 | Stop-Loss: Rs 950 | Target: Rs 1,080 | Return: 10 percent

The stock is trading above the resistance of the ascending triangle, which is positive for the stock to maintain momentum. Also, it formed a Doji on Friday despite the markets being strong. These types of structures act as a continuum formation.

Above Rs 990 level, we are expecting the stock to move toward Rs 1,050-1,080 level in the near term. Buy at current levels and place stop-loss at Rs 950.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Sun TV Network: Buy | LTP: Rs 553 | Stop-Loss: Rs 536 | Target: Rs 585 | Return: 6 percent

The stock has recently formed a ‘Higher Top Higher Bottom’ structure and has given a breakout from its resistance on the weekly charts. The price upmove has been supported by good volumes while the RSI oscillator is hinting at a positive momentum.

Traders can buy the stock around current market price of Rs 553 for potential short term target around Rs 585. The stop-loss on short positions should be placed below Rs 536.

Tata Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 105 | Stop-Loss: Rs 100 | Target: Rs 114 | Return: 9 percent

The metal stocks were buzzing last week as we witnessed buying interest in some of the counters with good volumes. This stock has seen a breakout from a consolidation phase and has given a breakout from a falling trendline resistance.

The volumes have increased along with the upmove in prices which is a positive sign. The price volumes breakout hints at probability of an uptrend and hence, we advise traders to look for buying opportunities in the stock.

Traders can buy the stock around current market price of Rs 105 for potential short term target around Rs 114. The stop-loss on positions should be placed below Rs 100.

The market extended losses for yet another week, with the BSE Sensex and Nifty50 losing more than 1 percent amid nervousness in global markets after the Federal Reserve and several other central banks declared significant rate hikes in the week ended September 23.

The Nifty50 has broken all the crucial supports of 17,400-17,500 last week and managed to settle above the 17,300 mark, at 17,327 with 1.16 percent decline, denting the overall market sentiment. Given the subdued environment, the index may touch its August lows of around 17,150 and if that gets broken, then falling below the psychological 17,000 mark can't be ruled out in the coming sessions, with hurdle on the upside at 17,700-17,800 levels, experts said.

""As we have witnessed a decisive breach below the major support zone in the Nifty, one should not rule out the possibility of it testing the immediate swing low of 17,150-odd zone, while the sacrosanct support lies at the psychological mark of 17,000,"" Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical and Derivative Research at Angel One, said.

On the flipside, a series of resistances could be seen starting from 17,500 to 17,800 in the comparable period, he said.

Considering the recent price action, the market expert advised traders not to carry aggressive overnight bets for a while and, instead, adopt the strategy of one-step-at-a-time and respect levels on either side.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the September 23 closing prices:

Jatin Gohil, Technical & Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

Divis Laboratories: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,642.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,440 | Target: Rs 4,069 | Return: 12 percent

After a higher level of reversal (from Rs 3,974 to Rs 3,446), the stock respected its prior multiple lows (Rs 3,450) connecting horizontal trendline and resumed its up-move. On September 23, the stock rose to an eight-day high of Rs 3,700, where volume was above average. Its daily RSI (relative strength index) is positively poised above the 50 mark. As per the current set-up, we believe the stock will continue its up-move.

We believe the stock has the potential to surpass its downward sloping 100-day SMA (simple moving average of Rs 3,734), which could lead it towards prior swing high (Rs 3,974) initially and its 200-day SMA (Rs 4,069) subsequently.

On the lower side, the stock will continue to find support around its prior multiple lows connecting horizontal trendline.

State Bank of India: Sell | LTP: Rs 550.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 579 | Target: Rs 486 | Return: 12 percent

The stock reversed after testing its prior highs (Rs 542 and Rs 549) connecting rising trendline and breached its weekly rising trend. The stock formed a bearish reversal pattern-Shooting Star-right after deliberation pattern. The key technical indicators gave sell signal after bearish divergence on the short-term timeframe chart.

This could drag the stock towards Rs 516-500-486, which coincides with its 20-week EMA (exponential moving average), psychological level and its 50-week EMA. In case of any rebound, its prior highs connecting rising trendline will cap the up-move.

On the higher side, the stock will face major hurdle around its prior swing high.

Federal Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 116.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 130 | Target: Rs 92 | Return: 21 percent

The stock formed a bearish reversal pattern-Double Top around Rs 128 and poised for a down move. Again its weekly RSI reversed after testing 70-mark. In the past, the stock suffered a sharp decline after an identical formation in its weekly RSI. Since May 2019, the stock witnessed sharp reversals and reported fall between 24-28 percent from its respective peaks at least three times.

As is said, history repeats itself, I feel, it could drag the stock towards its psychological level (Rs 100) initially and trendline support (Rs 92) subsequently. In case of any rebound, the stock will face hurdle around its Double Top formation.

Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi

Rossari Biotech: Buy | LTP: Rs 937.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 885 | Target: Rs 1,050 | Return: 12 percent

Rossari Biotech has witnessed a very sharp correction of 51 percent between October 2021 and June 2022. Since then the stock has been consolidating at Rs 825-880 (see chart) and it has made a solid base near Rs 900 levels.

On August 3, 2022, it gave a classic breakout from said levels along with massive volume picking up which hints at further upside.

At current juncture, the said counter has taken support near its top of the previous range breakout. One can hold (if already bought) and add (if considering fresh buy) at the current market price. Upside is seen till Rs 1,050 with credible support at Rs 885.

NMDC: Buy | LTP: Rs 127.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 117 | Target: Rs 145 | Return: 13 percent

On the daily chart, NMDC has been making higher highs and higher lows since the last couple of months. Also volume is picking up on a daily basis which is complementing its up move.

From the indicator perspective, the weekly RSI (relative strength index) is above 50 along with weekly stochastics overbought, which further confirms upside in counter.

One can buy in small tranches at current levels and buy another tranche at around Rs 121-122 levels (if again tested). Upside is expected till Rs 145 and support is seen around Rs 117.

Pfizer: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,212 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,950 | Target: Rs 4,700 | Return: 12 percent

Pfizer has seen a free fall since September 2021 till June 2022 which resulted in a 31 percent correction. Since then, the stock has been consolidating between Rs 4,000 and Rs 4,200 besides making higher highs and higher lows and it has made a solid base near Rs 4,200.

On the indicator front, the weekly RSI has shown bullish divergence (refer chart) which is adding more confirmation for further upside in the counter.

One can hold (if already bought) and add (if considering fresh buy) at the current market price. Upside is seen till Rs 4,700 with credible support seen at Rs 3,950.

Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Hindalco Industries: Sell | LTP: Rs 396.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 418 | Target: Rs 365 | Return: 8 percent

In the last one-and-a-half months, the stock has consolidated within a channel and prices have given a breakdown below the support in Friday’s session. The prices have also closed below its 20 DEMA support and thus we could see an underperformance in the stock in the near term.

The ‘RSI’ oscillator is also hinting at a negative momentum and hence, any pullback move towards the supports broken is likely to witness selling pressure.

Hence, traders can look to sell the stock on pullback in the range of Rs 400-404 for potential short term targets of Rs 365. The stop-loss on short positions should be placed above Rs 418.

AU Small Finance Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 637.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 665 | Target: Rs 605 | Return: 5 percent

In the recent up-move, the stock resisted around the previous swing highs and seems to have resumed its corrective phase. Prices have closed the week below its crucial '20 DEMA’ support and the RSI oscillator has also given a negative crossover indicating a bearish momentum.

As the banking index too has been witnessing a corrective phase, we expect the stock to correct in the near term.

Hence, traders can look to sell the stock in the range of Rs 645-650 for potential short term targets of Rs 605. The stop-loss on short positions should be placed above Rs 665.

Bajaj Finserv: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,721.9 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,790 | Target: Rs 1,570 | Return: 9 percent

The stock is diverging negatively and is also forming a lower high after reaching the highest high of Rs 1,844. Based on the oscillators, it looks like the stock is exhausted at higher levels.

On a weekly basis, it has formed an Inverted Hammer candlestick, which is indicating further weakness in the near term.

Sell at current levels and more at Rs 1,750-1,760, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,790. On the downside, the stock may slide towards Rs 1,670 and Rs 1,570 in the near term.

Jindal Steel & Power: Sell | LTP: Rs 425.80 | Stop-Loss: Rs 440 | Target: Rs 390 | Return: 8 percent

The stock has formed an Inverted Hammer pattern on top of the current up move. In the current week, the stock has broken the lowest level of the previous week. It is a sign of further weakness in the near term and in case the stock drops below Rs 420 level then it would send the stock to Rs 390. Sell at current levels and at Rs 430, with stop-loss at Rs 440.

Divis Laboratories: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,642.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,540 | Target: Rs 3,850 | Return: 6 percent

The stock is trading volatile but is within a broad trading range, indicating a sharp break out in the near term. On a weekly basis, it has formed multiple bottom between Rs 3,540 and Rs 3,560, which will help the stock to trade with a bullish trend.

It is a buy at current levels and on the further decline with a final stop-loss at Rs 3,540. At higher levels, it could rally towards Rs 3,750 and Rs 3,850 in the near term.

It was yet another weak session for the market as participants maintained caution on Tuesday ahead of the major global event of the Federal Reserve policy meeting.

The BSE Sensex fell nearly 500 points to 55,268 and the Nifty50 closed below 200 days exponential moving average (16,520), falling nearly 150 points to 16,484.

All sectors witnessed selling pressure. Nifty IT was the biggest loser, down nearly 3 percent, followed by Auto, FMCG, Pharma and Realty indices which fell more than 1 percent each.

The broader markets also joined bears' party as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices were down 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent respectively on weak breadth. About three shares declined for every advancing share on the NSE.

The volatility index India VIX increased further, up 2.77 percent at 18.17 levels, making the trend more favourable for bears.

Stocks that were in action and bucked the trend included Bajaj Finserv, Sun TV Network and Delta Corp which were among the top five gainers in the futures and options segment.

Bajaj Finserv rallied 5.5 percent to Rs 13,313, the highest closing level since May 11, and formed bullish candle on the daily charts with significant volumes, trading in the upper band of Bollinger Band by taking support at 5 DEMA since last week.

Sun TV Network climbed 5.2 percent to Rs 465.80, the highest closing level since May 2, with robust bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with large volumes despite weakness in the equity market. With Tuesday's big candle, there was an expansion of Bollinger Band in the upper band.

Delta Corp gained 4.6 percent at Rs 193, continuing uptrend for second consecutive session with bullish candlestick pattern formation and more than above average volumes.

Here's what Ruchit Jain of 5paisa recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Bajaj Finserv

Along with the broader markets, the stock has seen a sharp price wise correction since the month of October 2021. However, during this month, prices have seen a pullback move from the swing lows of Rs 10,727 and now the price momentum is gaining momentum with rising volumes.

The ‘RSI’ (relative strength index) oscillator is also hinting at a positive momentum and hence, we could see further pullback move in the stock in the near term. The previous support of Rs 13,800 which was broken in the month of May will be the first level to watch as previous support could usually act as resistance on pullback.

If the price manages to surpass the same, then it could continue its momentum towards Rs 14,100 and Rs 14,900 which are retracement levels of the previous correction. On the flipside, the '20 DEMA' around Rs 12,250 will now be seen as a crucial support on any declines.

Sun TV Network

Post consolidating in a range in last couple of months, the stock witnessed a buying interest and has given a breakout from that consolidation. The volumes along with the breakout were high which is a positive sign.

The momentum readings are also hinting at a positive momentum and hence, we could see further upmoves in the near term. Hence, traders should look to trade with a positive bias and look to buy on declines around the support range of Rs 450-440.

Price could test the trendline resistance which is seen around Rs 490. Above which, it could then result into a larger degree breakout.

Delta Corp

The stock has recently seen an underperformance as prices have corrected sharply from its high of Rs 340 to Rs 162. Prices have now seen some pullback move from this swing low but are yet to witness any impulsive up move.

Hence, one should read this as just a pullback move which would retrace the recent correction. The 23.6 percent retracement of this correction is placed around Rs 204 while 38.2 percent retracement is seen around Rs 230. The immediate support for the stock is around Rs 175.

The two-day rally has added Rs 4,73,814.1 crore to the market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms, which now stands at Rs 2,55,39,794.75 crore. ""Firm global cues bolstered market sentiment as the benchmark Sensex closed above the psychological 54,000-mark on strong all-round buying support.

Among the Sensex constituents, IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Bajaj Finserv, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and UltraTech Cement were the major gainers on Monday. Dr Reddy’s Lab, HDFC Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti, Nestle, Hindustan Unilever and HDFC were the laggards.

The market ended yet another volatile week on a mildly positive note, with the Nifty smartly defending the crucial 15,700 mark on July 1. On the first day of the July series, most sectors, barring oil & gas, helped the market recover and narrow losses.

The Nifty rose 53 points to close at 15,752 during the week ended July 1, taking support at 15,500 as well as 15,700. After getting support at around 15,190 in the previous two weeks, the index formed higher lows in the last week, which experts say is a good sign, with resistance at 15,900-16,180.

The index formed a kind of a bearish Hammer pattern on the weekly scale, and on the daily charts, a bullish hammer, which is generally a trend-reversal pattern.

Oscillators or sentiment indicators showed a marginal uptick on the weekly charts. The relative strength index moved up from 40.49 levels to 41.1. The Stochastic gave a positive crossover, climbing up from 17.6 to 19.4 levels.

""Till the Nifty trades above the 15,500 mark, one should continue to trade with a positive bias and look for stock-specific buying opportunities in the coming week,"" Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com said.

On the higher side, he said 15,850-15,900 is seen as the immediate near-term resistance on the lower timeframe charts and a breakout should lead the Nifty to the retracement marks of 15,990 and 16,180.

Here are the top 10 trading ideas from experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on closing prices on July 1:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,107 | Stop-Loss: Rs 970 | Target: Rs 1,180-1,330 | Return: 7-20 percent

The stock is forming a series of higher tops and higher bottoms, which is extremely positive. It has again surpassed its previous high of Rs 1,060 last week with the decisive dismissal. Such a pattern helps the stock to move into a new bullish segment.

The level of Rs 970 will be a great support for the stock and as long as it trades above it, the chances of reaching Rs 1,180 or Rs 1,330 will be bright.

The strategy should be to buy at Rs 1,110 and add more at Rs 1,000. Place the last stop-loss at Rs 970.

The stock has bounced back strongly after completing a corrective pattern at Rs 10,727, which is positive. The breakout is decisive and depending on the formation, it can extend to Rs 12,300-13,000 in the next few weeks.

The strategy should be to buy partly at current levels and on the downside, at Rs 10,900. Protect long position with the final stop-loss at Rs 10,700.

Cipla: Buy | LTP: Rs 949.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 900 | Target: Rs 1,030 | Return: 8.5 percent

It is advisable to buy between Rs 950 and Rs 930 for targets of Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,080, where the stock has a multiple resistance zone. Keep stop-loss at Rs 900.

Hindustan Unilever: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,282.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,230 | Target: Rs 2,390 | Return: 5 percent

At the same time, it upheld the support zone at around Rs 1,400. The chart pattern and positioning of indicators are pointing towards the possibility of a breakout soon. We recommend accumulating within the Rs 1,485-1,495 zone.

Godrej Properties: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,227.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,160 | Target: Rs 1,310 | Return: 7 percent

After correcting from a high of Rs 2,598 in October 2021, Godrej Properties found support at around Rs 1,130 in June 2022. The stock has found support around the same level recently past and it also coincides with the 200 weeks simple moving average (SMA). On July 1, the stock reversed its downtrend by crossing its previous swing high of Rs 1,230 during the day.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals, as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-period SMA on the 60 minutes chart. Momentum readings like the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), too, are in a rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential upsides.

With the realty index also showing signs of strength, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 1,220 and 1,224, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,160 and target at Rs 1,310.

Mphasis: Sell | LTP: Rs 2,241 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,370 | Target: Rs 2,040 | Return: 9 percent

With the stock trading below key moving averages like the 20 and 50-day SMAs, the 14-week RSI in a decline mode and the intermediate technical setup looking negative, we believe the stock is headed lower in the coming weeks.

We recommend a sell between Rs 2,235 and Rs 2,245, with a stop-loss at Rs 2,370 and the target at Rs 2,040.

Its key technical indicators are positively poised on major timeframe charts. The stock has the potential to move towards lifetime high of Rs 153.5 initially and Rs 166 subsequently, which coincides with its prior highs (Rs 139 and Rs 153.5), connecting a rising trendline.

Havells India: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,111 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,037 | Target: Rs 1,230 | Return: 11 percent

The stock formed a strong base around its prior lows (Rs 958 and Rs 1,037) connecting the rising trendline and is poised for a rebound.

The stock could move towards the upper band of the channel in the short term. On the lower side, the stock will find support around the lowest level of March 2022.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research, 5paisa.com

United Spirits: Buy | LTP: Rs 788.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 754 | Target: Rs 830-850 | Return: 5-8 percent

The 'RSI Smoothed' oscillator has recently given a positive crossover and is indicating a positive momentum. Looking at the technical evidence, we expect the stock to rally higher in the near term.

Traders can buy the stock in the range of Rs 790-785 for potential targets of Rs 830 and Rs 850 in two-three weeks. The stop-loss should be placed below Rs 754.

Chalet Hotels: Buy | LTP: Rs 327.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 316 | Target: Rs 349 | Return: 6.5 percent

The stock had seen a time-wise correction in the last couple of months, where prices traded within a range and relatively outperformed the broader markets. On July 1, the stock gave a breakout from the resistance-end of this consolidation and hence the stock seems to have resumed its uptrend.

The short-term moving average has given a positive crossover to the medium term and the relative strength index (RSI) oscillator is in buy mode and has indicated a positive momentum.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 328-325 for a potential target of Rs 349 in the near term. The stop-loss can be placed below Rs 316.

""The normalisation of interest rates towards the pre-pandemic levels. However, we're still 25 bps away from the pre-pandemic level of 5.15 per cent. We are in a period of global inflation, and the two main triggers of consumer inflation in India are food prices and fuel prices,"" said Bajaj.

He pointed out that our Indian economy, unlike western economies, has strong growth drivers. And hence, RBI is talking about 7.2 per cent growth, making India the fastest-growing large economy. Additionally, a good monsoon may help lower the food prices in India, he added.

Do you expect any impact on consumption or demand amid the increased interest rates?

In the last two years, consumer spending couldn't increase as it should have. As the middle class became savers owing to the uncertainty. However, now the momentum in consumer spending has started picking up. There will be some sectors like home loans which may face an impact. But overall, at the current level, India still has a chance of good growth as long as inflation is under control.

Savings over the last two years have started to erode due to rising inflation. How much the incremental costs will go up for you, and how much of it will you be able to pass on? And, what will be the impact on margins?

For the lending sector, there could be a large transmission in the large-value corporate loans, as well as for retail loans. It will differ from one entity to another. It will depend on the segments, current margin profile, and scope of growth. The current rate hike will not affect growth.

At a 6 percent repo rate, will it affect the growth rate from a corporate point of view?

Even at 6 percent repo rates, the growth will be manageable. A lot depends on the consumption on the ground, the mood of the ground, the robust consumption cycle, the strong export scheme, and the government's focus on PLI schemes for promoting manufacturing in India. All these can be levers towards growth.

The next 12 months are very important; the actions we will take now are going to affect beyond four quarters. Hence, consulted coordinated effort is going to be crucial.

Often, these will be offers related to your pre-approved personal loan eligibility or another type of unsecured credit. But before you accept any such offers, especially loans, you should be aware of the pre-approved loan meaning. A pre-approved loan is one that the lender extends to you based on your current financial standing. It is a product that is typically offered by banks or NBFCs to existing customers with a flawless credit history and excellent CIBIL score.

You may get these pre-approved loan offers regularly, and you can use them to cover short-term financial needs without having to put up any collateral or security. When used wisely, such offers can be quite helpful and cost-effective too. However, to ensure that you get the best deal and are fully aware of the details of such offers, here’s all you need to know about the pre-approved personal loan.

Attributes of pre-approved personal loans

Considering that pre-approved offers are granted based on a lender’s prior assessments of your profile, these offers differ from regular loan offers. This is why it is important that you understand the pre-approved personal loan meaning to ensure that you don’t make any costly mistakes. For clarity on such offers, here are a few attributes to know.





• These offers are attractive and are usually available only for a limited period of time.



• The lender assesses your pre-approved personal loan eligibility prior to issuing an offer



• The sanction, interest rate and any other loan terms are personalised based on your financial profile



• Lenders usually extend a pre-approved personal loan to existing customers only



• Pre-approved personal loans are easier to avail than regular personal loans as you generally do not have to apply



• Pre-approved personal loans are collateral free offerings



• Pre-approved loan offers will change over time

A crucial point to note about such offers is that you should only borrow as required. These offers can be alluring and while they may only be available for a limited time, borrow wisely. You are responsible for timely repayment and taking on debt you can’t handle will negatively impact your CIBIL score.

Eligibility for pre-approved personal loans

Pre-approved personal loan eligibility terms will vary from lender to lender. However, the most important criterion to note is that most lenders will require you to be an existing customer. However, even as an existing customer, you may still need to meet some basic criteria before you get such offers. To know what’s expected, take a look at these pointers.





• A CIBIL score of 750 or higher



• A steady income



• A relationship with the lender



• A strong repayment track record and credit profile

Do note that since these loans are offered to existing customers, it is a paperless process. This means that you can get a pre-approved loan without income proof as lenders will already have these details on file. However, in some cases, you may be requested to furnish basic paperwork. For instance, when availing a Bajaj Finserv Pre-approved Personal Loan, you may be required to submit a cancelled cheque, KYC documents, and bank account details.

Benefits of pre-approved personal loans

There are many benefits of a pre-approved loan, making them the ideal short-term solution. For one, since the loan is pre-approved, you do not have to apply or go through the standard underwriting processes. This expedites the loan acquisition process significantly, allowing some lenders to disburse funds quickly. For instance, when you avail a Bajaj Finserv Pre-approved Personal Loan, you can get the approved sanction disbursed to your bank account in 4 hours*. In addition, select customers can of a pre-approved personal loan with a 100% online application process without having to submit any documents.These customers can get the money in their account as early as 30 minutes*.

Besides near-instant disbursal, another key benefit is that you may get specialised terms. Be it the sanction, tenor options, or even the interest rate; the terms are based on your eligibility. As such, having a stellar financial and credit profile is advantageous as it helps you get the best deal. Lastly, the entire process to avail of a pre-approved personal loan offer can be completed online. For instance, with lenders like Bajaj Finserv, you can check the offer, authorise disbursal, make payments and track the loan digitally. You never have to visit the lender's physical branch and you can complete the process online, from anywhere.

You may avail a pre-approved personal loan for a variety of purposes, and you should always check the terms offered to you. For a hassle-free and cost-effective experience, opt for the Bajaj Finserv Pre-approved Personal Loan. Get easy access to up to Rs. 10 lakh and opt for a tenor between 24 and 60 months. Bajaj Finserv offers pre-approved personal loans to both Salaried as well as self-employed existing customers. The lender also offers pre-approved loans to select new customers.

However, unforeseen circumstances can never be fully anticipated and you may, at times, need more money than you have saved. This is where personal loans come in handy, as they are offered without collateral and have no restrictions on usage.

But just because a personal loan is offered without collateral doesn’t imply you should apply for one without doing your homework. Before you click on the ‘personal loan apply’ button, use a personal loan EMI calculator on Bajaj Finserv for an in-depth analysis of your loan scheme. Failing to do this may lead to a situation where you cannot keep up with your monthly repayments.

An EMI calculator or a personal loan interest calculator is terrific for all loan applicants. It allows you to determine your personal loan EMIs in advance and helps you plan for your repayment strategy. Let’s check out the Bajaj Finserv Personal Loan EMI calculator in more detail.

What is a personal loan EMI calculator?

A personal loan EMI calculator is self-explanatory. It calculates your monthly EMIs, total interest amount, and total repayment amount. Just enter the loan amount you need, key in the personal loan interest rate, and choose a convenient tenor. Based on your inputs, the EMI calculator will display your monthly installment amount, the overall amount you pay as interest on the principal, and your total repayment liability. Bear in mind that the Bajaj Finserv EMI calculator is just an indicative tool and banks will determine your loan interest rate only after assessing your financial credibility.

How does an EMI Calculator work?

Here’s how a personal loan EMI calculator works for the mathematically inclined.

The calculations are based on the formula: EMI = P × r × (1 + r)n/((1 + r)n - 1) where P= Loan amount, r= interest rate, n=tenure in number of months. Yes, you can use pen and paper and calculate everything yourself. But why bother when an EMI calculator will do it for you accurately and in a snap!

Advantages of using EMI calculators

Here are the main advantages of using an EMI calculator:

Compare Loans: EMI calculators are a terrific way to compare various loan offers. Since the personal loan interest rates vary from bank to bank, you can key the numbers into an EMI calculator to gauge your monthly repayment liability for each case. A personal loan EMI calculator will tell you instantly if a particular loan scheme is suitable or unsuitable for your financial situation.

Choose the right tenor: An EMI calculator lets you play around with different tenor options and arrive at the right one for your needs. The tenor and EMI are inversely related, which means the longer the tenor the lower the EMI, and vice versa. As long as the EMI amount is manageable, you will not find it burdensome to pay off the loan.

Calculate the total interest: A personal loan EMI calculator also gives you a breakdown of your repayment scheme. It will tell you your total repayment amount and the component you pay off as interest on the principal. All this important information is available at a glance if you use an EMI calculator on the Bajaj Finserv website.

Save time: Remember that mathematical formula? Imagine using it every time you need to calculate something to do with your loan. Even calling up the loan department of different financial institutions every time you have a doubt is impractical. The solution – get online and use a personal loan EMI calculator that gives you all the details you need instantly.

A personal loan EMI calculator enables you to make a well-informed personal loan decision. You can check your equated monthly instalments, total interest amount, total repayment amount, and scheduled repayments with the Bajaj Finserv EMI calculator. An EMI calculator will help you choose the right tenor for your personal loan and allow you to pay it back without any problems. If you plan to apply for an online personal loan, you can also use an EMI calculator to compare offers from various banks and choose the best one for yourself.",697,0.9926193356513977
2022-05-16 17:08:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/announcements/4-ways-to-get-a-personal-loan-with-a-low-cibil-score-8518191.html,"While it is wise to plan your objectives around your financial capabilities, there may be situations where you may have to dip into your financial reserves. Ideally, this is something you want to avoid and this is when a loan from the right lender can help. Whether you need the funds to pay for higher education, travel, or home renovation, a personal loan can come in handy. But you first need to qualify for funds, and most lenders will require you to have a CIBIL score of at least 750. If you are unsure about your score and want to do a CIBIL score check, free services are available.

Knowing this information is key, as lenders may not offer easy approval if you don’t have the required score. Fortunately, even with a low CIBIL score, you can get a personal loan. Here’s how.

Borrow a smaller sanction

Your CIBIL score dictates your creditworthiness and lenders are less likely to offer you a large sum without an adequate score. This is because the lender incurs a greater risk by lending to a borrower with a low score. However, you can still get approved for a loan if you apply for a smaller sanction. For instance, top lenders will offer up to Rs.25 lakh as a loan and while you will not get the full sanction with a low score, you may be able to get approved for a smaller one, if you can provide the necessary proof. Moreover, by borrowing a smaller sum, you have the opportunity to repay it consistently and build your credit score too.

Apply for a joint loan or with a guarantor

If you have a low CIBIL score and do not meet the lender’s requirement, you can still get the loan by applying with a guarantor. Here, the lender considers both applicants' CIBIL scores and credit profiles while approving the loan. As such, applying with a guarantor with a good credit profile and steady finances greatly improves your chances of getting approval. What’s more, you may even be able to qualify for a much higher sanction. This is also true if you co-apply for the loan as the responsibility of repayment is shared by all applicants. So, if you need a large sum and your CIBIL score isn’t high enough yet, you should request relatives or friends to either co-apply or become a guarantor.

Show proof of income to support loan repayment

To approve your personal loan application, the lender must be confident in your ability to repay the amount. Since it is an unsecured loan, lenders rely on your CIBIL score and your financial documents to assess your capabilities. However, in some cases, it is possible to have a low CIBIL score but have an income that can support payments easily. This occurs if you are a new-to-credit applicant or have very little prior experience with credit. So, if you have a low CIBIL score, be sure to disclose your income and any additional streams of income you may have. Proving that you have sufficient cash flow to cover payments comfortably is key and can help you get approval with ease.

Assess your credit report and rectify errors

When doing a CIBIL score check, free services like the one offered by Bajaj Finserv allow you to check your CIBIL report as well. This is when you should go through your profile and check if there are any errors. For instance, closed credit accounts that aren’t listed as closed accounts can be a huge problem and cause your score to dip. Fixing such issues right away will increase your score and may even help you get approval for a loan. Besides such errors, you should check if there are enquiries on your profile that you do not recognise. These could suggest fraud and that your information is being misused. Report such issues and ensure that all open accounts are verified and owned by you.

Armed with these pointers, you now have the necessary information to acquire a personal loan with a low CIBIL score. Also, do not wait too long before doing a CIBIL score check. Free services are available and you should use these to frequently check your report and ensure that everything is in order. For instance, you can check CIBIL score by PAN Card on the Bajaj Finserv website and the process is completely free. What’s more, it takes just 2 minutes and you get a clear idea of your credit profile as you can access a customised credit health report.

Doing so ensures that you stay informed of changes to your credit profile and that you can address issues as they crop up. Remember, even though it can be a hurdle to get a loan when you have a low score, there are ways to work around it. To ensure that you have the best experience, pick the right lender and you can enjoy easy approval without any hassles.

2022-04-26 13:43:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/announcements/smart-insights-to-getting-the-best-personal-loan-interest-rate-8412411.html,"Personal loans are considered one of the best credit instruments for salaried individuals. They are specifically designed for people with a steady income who face immediate funds requirements for various reasons. You can avail yourself of an online personal loan at the best personal loan interest rates for medical emergencies, setting up a home gym, going on a vacation, and even covering wedding expenses.

Going for personal loans online is a convenient option as it also gives you the chance to use a loan EMI calculator. This handy tool helps you calculate your precise EMI amount for the loan amount you seek. An online personal loan allows you to use the disbursed amount you see fit. Another advantage of a personal loan is that no collateral is required. To get the best personal interest rates with lenders like Bajaj Finserv, you must ideally have a high CIBIL Score of above 750.

If you anticipate any extra expenditure soon, here are some tips that will help you get the lowest interest rate personal loan:

1. Compare interest rates

Check what interest rate is offered by your primary bank, and even if you find it satisfactory, check out the personal loan interest rates of other lending institutions. This will give you an idea about the ongoing market rates and allow you to make the best decision for yourself. You can also negotiate with your bank or financial establishment and ask for a lower interest rate. But your powers of negotiation depend largely on your credit score and history.

2. Floating vs. Fixed interest rates

Banks often compute the overall interest rate of your online personal loan through different computing methods. Some banks charge interest at a flat rate, while others use a floating method. A flat interest rate is calculated directly on the principal amount right when processing the loan. The entire payment liability, including the interest, is divided into EMIs. On the other hand, a floating interest is applied on a progressively diminishing principal balance. This implies that the interest component of your EMI reduces with every payment. While a fixed interest rate is easy to calculate and manage, a floating interest rate is, without a doubt, more economical in the long run. You can use a loan EMI calculator to better understand how these interest rates work.



3. Build and maintain a solid credit score

Your credit score plays a vital role in determining your eligibility for a personal loan. Most banks require you to maintain a credit score of 750 or above, as this is a straightforward indicator of your repayment capacity. A higher credit score allows you to negotiate with your bank for the lowest personal loan interest rates. The best way to build your credit score is to pay all your credit card bills and EMIs on other loans quickly. And never, ever default on any loan!

4. Keep a check for offers from the lender Banks often launch special offers on occasions such as Diwali, New Year, and Independence Day and grant personal loans at relaxed interest rates. Going for an online personal loan is ideal when a lending institution has slashed its rates but getting to know about the offer in time is the trick here. To ensure you don’t miss out on any festive deals, you should subscribe to newsletters and WhatsApp groups of all the major banks in the country. Checking out the official portals of banks periodically is also a good idea. 5. Keep your documents ready

Online personal loans are disbursed quite fast and are offered without collateral. Banks, however, rarely, if ever, compromise on the eligibility criteria. Since a personal loan is disbursed without collateral, it is a high-risk investment for the bank. Thus, lending institutions ensure that they grant loans only to eligible and deserving candidates. Here are the conditions you must meet in order to avail yourself of a Bajaj Finserv Personal Loan:",655,0.9651801586151123

The RSI on weekly has witnessed a range shift and is sustaining above the 50-mark since August 2020.

We expect the stock to continue its outperformance and move higher towards Rs 45,600, a break above which can lead the stock towards Rs 48,000-mark.

A stop-loss of 41,000 should be maintained for this setup.

An average Indian wedding costs between Rs 18 lakh and Rs 5 crore to cater to the venue, décor, food, entertainment and accommodation for various ceremonies that are part of the main event.

All you need to ensure is that you compare various personal loan interest rates from lenders in the market to get the best and most affordable deal. To plan your dream wedding using a personal loan, apply online for maximum convenience. Read on to understand the easy steps to avail of a wedding loan .

Steps to follow to get a wedding loan

There are two methods to apply for a marriage loan. You can either apply at a lender’s branch or online. Online application makes things a lot easier as you can focus on wedding preparations, rather than waiting in queues or wasting time commuting. For getting a wedding loan online, follow these steps:

3. Enter your income information and KYC data

4. Select the loan amount you desire and submit the form digitally

However, despite the ease of applying, you still need to ensure that you make the right borrowing choices and get affordable personal loan interest rates. For a quick checklist, you can rely on for quick and competitive marriage financing, read the following pointers.

Check and meet lender-specific personal loan eligibility criteria

This helps you increase your chances of getting a wedding loan and saves you time. It also helps you get the power to negotiate competitive personal loan interest rates.

Ensure that you have a high CIBIL score

For an unsecured personal loan, a CIBIL score of 750 and above is considered ideal. This score ranges between 300 and 900 and is based on extensive analysis and a detailed examination of your credit history. With a high CIBIL score, you have a higher chance of getting a budget-friendly interest rate on your loan and quicker approval.

Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio

A low DTI ratio indicates that you are more likely to manage your existing and new debt. This increases your personal loan eligibility. Maintaining a low DTI ratio also increases your ability to get quick financing in case of emergencies. So, ensure to manage your expenses by following a budget and not relying too much on credit. By paying off existing debt or reducing your debt before you apply for a wedding loan, you can work towards decreasing this number.

Use a pre-approved offer

Based on your eligibility and documents, the lender will analyse your loan application and approve a loan amount for you. It is more likely for you to get a higher marriage loan amount when you meet all the eligibility criteria and have a good credit score and when you avail of a pre-approved offer. These offers are usually given to existing customers, especially those with a good repayment record.

You no longer have to visit a lender’s branch, stand in a queue, and wait for your turn. Thanks to fintech, you can now complete the process completely online and in just a few clicks. This saves precious time and allows you to plan your loan efficiently after comparing the interest rates, tenor options and special perks offered by different lenders.

However, to successfully avail of instruments like the Bajaj Finserv Personal Loan, you must meet certain criteria. Since it is a collateral-free loan, lenders may be a lot stricter, and so, you must meet all the requirements without any issues. Read on to know the crucial factors for personal loan instant approval.

A profile matching the basic age and citizenship criteria

The basic criteria that lenders assess are related to your age and citizenship. Typically, you need to be an adult between 21 and 67 years. Secondly, you must be an Indian citizen residing in India to qualify for this loan. If you meet these terms, you have passed the primary criteria to be eligible. However, make sure you have your age proof and address proof ready for verification.

A healthy CIBIL score

Your CIBIL score indicates your creditworthiness, and lenders refer to it when assessing your profile. Usually, the best lenders prefer a minimum CIBIL score of 750. If you own a credit card and use it regularly without defaulting, reaching and maintaining this CIBIL score is much easier. Your borrowing history and repayment track record also impact your CIBIL score. As such, always make sure that you clear your dues on time. An excellent score can help you get a low-interest personal loan offer easily.

Stable employment with a reputed employer

When you apply for a personal loan, your lender will look into your employment or source of income. This is to gauge whether your sources of income are reliable. A stable job or source of income is key to assure lenders that you can pay the EMIs regularly without failure. You enjoy quicker approval if you work in a reputed MNC, government office or have a job at a stable private company. This is also true if you have maintained a steady job at such organisations. All of these factors point toward the stability of your profile. So, if you have recently changed jobs, wait a few months before you apply.

Adequate monthly income to meet the lender’s city-specific requirements

Top lenders have city-specific monthly income requirements that you must be aware of. For Bajaj Finserv, it varies between Rs. 22,000 to Rs. 35,000 based on your city of residence. The lower end of that range is for Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, whereas the higher end is for Tier 1 cities like Delhi, Bangalore, Pune or Mumbai. Be sure to check this criterion before applying.

A low debt-to-income ratio

Your debt-to-income ratio is the percentage of your income already earmarked to service existing debt. As such, having a high DTI ratio, over 43%, means a large portion of your income is already being used and that you can’t handle more debt. It also impacts your credit score and lenders will see you as a high-risk borrower. Your application is likely to get rejected, or you may get approved at a higher-than-normal interest rate to cover the risks. Usually, a DTI ratio below 36% is considered acceptable, but it is always better to have as little debt as possible when you apply.

Now that you know the crucial factors to ensure personal loan instant approval, you can prepare accordingly. When the time comes to borrow, a smart option to consider is the Bajaj Finserv Personal Loan. You can get a high sanction of up to Rs. 25 lakh and get approved for it in just a few minutes. Meet the simple eligibility criteria and submit basic paperwork to receive disbursal within 24 hours.

For maximum affordability, calculate personal loan EMI options using the EMI calculator and choose a flexible tenor of up to 60 months to enjoy hassle-free repayment. Additionally, Bajaj Finserv maintains 100% transparency and there are no hidden charges at all. As such, you can borrow freely and enjoy a cost-effective experience with proper planning. Get started today to make the most of all these features and benefits. All you have to do is check your pre-approved offer by sharing basic details and you can get the approved funds in no time.

You can get your loan disbursals within a day and invest in home renovation, children’s education, medical procedures, and more. While it has become easier than ever to avail of small loans online, the personal loan interest rate is one of the critical factors you need to consider.

Getting a low-interest personal loan can make all the difference to your financial health now and in the future. There are many factors that affect the personal loan interest rates. While some are based on the personal loan eligibility terms set by the lender and on your credit-related actions, others are based on the market conditions. Read to know how you can get the best personal loan interest rates.

Your Income and Existing Debts

Regular income and a clean credit history are two key factors that will help you get the best deals for a personal loan. Lenders consider these factors in determining your ability to pay timely EMIs. If your income is relatively low or irregular, lenders may still offer a loan but at a relatively higher interest rate to cover their risk. Check the minimum income criteria set by lenders based on your residence, and make sure to meet them before you apply.

If you have any existing debt, your lender will consider it while processing your loan application. With a part of your income going into servicing them, you may be offered a lower loan amount or a higher interest rate. That said, as long as your debt takes up less than 40 percent of your current income, you should be able to get a competitive rate.

Your Employer and Type of Employment

Aside from your credit history, the firm you work for also impacts your personal loan eligibility terms and interest rates. This is because lenders can then rely on your employer to make timely salary payments. Working for a company that is not financially sound or has been irregular in paying salaries can result in a higher interest rate for you or an outright rejection of your loan application. Salaried employees working full time also get lower personal loan interest rates than part-time professionals.

Your CIBIL Score

Your credit score, also called CIBIL score, reflects your performance for repayment of previous loans and debts. It documents your credit history with which lenders can gauge your creditworthiness. The score reflects whether you have made timely repayments in the past and thus determines the risk you pose as a borrower. Usually a CIBIL score of 750 is enough for you to get approval for an affordable personal loan. With a higher credit score, you can negotiate to get a lower personal loan interest rate.

Your Relationship with Lenders

These days, you get small loans without any collateral, with ease. For a larger sanction, an established relationship with your lender puts you in a better position to get a low-interest personal loan. Based on your existing profile in their database, lenders may offer you better deals for a more pocket-friendly experience. However, this depends on how disciplined you have been with repayment in the past. If you have repaid previous debt on time, you can get personalised pre-approved offers that simplify applying for a loan.

Repo Rate and Market Conditions

The repo rate is the rate at which the Reserve Bank of India lends money to India’s banks and other financial institutions. If the RBI decreases the repo rate, you can borrow loans more affordably as personal loan interest rates are likely to reduce too. While this aspect is outside your control, depending on domestic and foreign financial market conditions, you can borrow when the repo rates are low. For instance, at 4 percent, the current repo rate is lower than it has been in a long time. This makes it an opportune time to get a low-interest personal loan.

Knowing different factors affecting personal loan interest rates, you can make an informed borrowing decisions. One of the best options is to go for the Bajaj Finserv Personal Loan. Apply online by filling in a simple form and get up to Rs 25 lakh at a nominal interest rate. You can qualify by meeting simple eligibility criteria and enjoying instant approval. Receive disbursal within 24 hours and enjoy zero limits on how you utilise the funds. To get a low-interest personal loan and ensure a quick approval, check your pre-approved offer and apply online.

As an investor, your focus should be picking tools that offer the highest returns and adequate safety. Adopting this method when investing will help you realise your short-term and long-term goals and create wealth.

In fact, a low-risk instrument like an FD is an ideal investment option for senior citizens, new families and practically anyone who wants to save for the future. Since this instrument isn't linked to the market, you can expect secured returns at the time of maturity.

If you're looking to maximise your returns amidst low interest rates and an uncertain market environment, you should choose to invest in company FDs. Investment plans, such as those offered by Bajaj Finance online FD, offer investors a low-risk, easy-to-invest option. Investors can avail of attractive returns up to 6.75%, all from the comfort of their homes.

Here's why you should consider investing in a Bajaj Finance online Fixed Deposit.

High FD interest rates

Bajaj Finance FD offers one of the highest FD rates, up to 6.50% for investors below 60 years, along with an additional 0.10% rate benefit for investing online. Senior citizens looking to invest in a Bajaj Finance FD can avail of an extra 0.25% over and above the base rate. High FD interest rates make this tool an attractive option for investing your hard-earned savings.

To understand how to maximise your savings with Bajaj Finance FD, consider an individual below 60 years investing Rs. 20,00,000 as the principal amount for 3 years. Given below is a tabular representation of returns at maturity.

Investor profile Tenor Interest rate Interest payout (Rs.) Maturity amount (Rs.) Online investor 36 months 6.60% 4,22,711 24,22,711 Offline investor 36 months 6.50% 4,15,899 24,15,899

You can use the accrued amount to manage the expenses of an emergency, plan a big purchase, or accomplish specific financial goals.

Make small monthly deposits

If you don't have a lump sum amount to invest in a fixed deposit in one go, you can consider building your corpus with the Systematic Deposit Plan (SDP). An SDP is a monthly saving scheme that lets you earn impressive returns by making small monthly deposits, starting with just Rs. 5,000 every month. Every deposit made is treated as a different FD, and the deposit amount will be auto-debited every month on the selected date from the depository account. SDP offers two variants when it comes to payout options, a single maturity scheme and a monthly maturity scheme. If you wish to get a lump sum at maturity, the single maturity scheme is wise. But, to generate a monthly income from your investments, the monthly maturity scheme may be a better option.

Laddering deposits for augmented returns

FD laddering is a simple investment strategy wherein investors park their money in multiple FD instruments of varying tenors. The technique essentially involves dividing one's funds and investing them in separate FDs instead of locking in the entire corpus in just one FD.

Easy online investment process

Bajaj Finance online FD scores high on ease of operations and logistics. The entire process of investing in an FD can be done through an easy online application process with your desktop or mobile, without the hassle of waiting in long queues and submitting multiple documents for verification.

Highest safety of deposit

Bajaj Finance FD has been accredited by the highest safety ratings of (FAAA) and (MAAA) by CRISIL and ICRA, respectively. With the advantage of the highest safety ratings and a suite of other benefits, it's safe to state that Bajaj Finance online FD stands as a strong preference if you're looking to find good investment options to grow your savings.

With the ever-growing emphasis on savings, knowing where and how to park your money becomes crucial. This fixed deposit is an excellent choice for investing your earnings, as it offers the highest safety of deposit.",655,0.7556209022348578

It is a financial move that you need to ponder for a long time before embarking on. If a home loan is your source of funding for a new home or property, then you owe the idea of a new home much thought.

If you do not have the means to manage a home loan that comes with high home loan EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment) payments, then we recommend that you do not opt for a home loan. Knowing the home loan amortization schedule that suits you best is a great start to getting a decent home loan. Using a home loan calculator doubles your chances of getting a home loan that will not burden you greatly.

To complete the home loan repayment process, you should prepare to review and consider every angle of your financial situation. A home loan EMI calculator gives you sincere home loan options based on the state of your finances. So, if you are capable of shouldering a housing loan, then we urge you to apply for one. Note that it’s also important to consider your source of income before applying for a home loan so that you can determine whether it will be stable for the loan duration. Additionally, we advise that you do proper checks to be sure that you will have money to save after making monthly home loan EMI payments.

In this article, you’ll learn what the EMI calculator for a home loan is and why you need it to make informed decisions on prospective home loan deals.

What is a Home Loan Calculator?

The EMI calculator for home loans is an online-based medium used to calculate the EMI for your housing loan. When you input certain information about the home loan you want to apply for, the housing loan emi calculator works out the accurate amount you will pay each month. The home loan EMI payments continue till the entire loan amount has been paid off. The home loan EMI calculator also helps you decide which home loan amortization schedule to select based on your financial health.

Read on to learn the benefits of the home loan calculator and why you should utilize it.

How the Home Loan Calculator Makes Loan Planning Easier for You

Using the house loan calculator to determine your home loan amortization schedule is beneficial in many ways. Here are some of the benefits of using a home loan EMI calculator:





• Its simplicity, convenience, and ability to provide accurate information regarding your home loan EMI payments makes the housing loan EMI calculator resourceful. This helps you do adequate housing loan planning, especially with the numbers. Calculating the numbers yourself makes the activity liable to mistakes. Utilizing the house loan calculator before you apply for a home loan guarantees that you get accurate results each time you use it.

• Using the home loan interest calculator ensures that you stay secure financially and also protects you from future financial problems. Knowing your home loan amortization schedule makes planning easy, and you can apply for the home loan that fits your budget.

• If you would like to make prepayments to service your home loan, then use the EMI calculator for your home loan. The calculator can reveal how prepayments can help you complete your loan repayment ahead of schedule.

• You can use this online tool to compare the loan offers from several lenders, banks, and non-banking financial companies (NBFC) alike. Using the calculator will display the amount involved in borrowing from each lender plus the EMIs.

• When you use a housing loan interest rate calculator, you enjoy a risk-free experience. Your identity is safe, and you should harbour no fear of compromise. The Bajaj Finserv EMI calculator is secure and provides credible details.

Benefits of Applying for a Home Loan

Some of the benefits of a home loan and why you should apply for one today are:

• Applying for a home loan guarantees that you will be able to save money for other purposes. The amount you spend to service the home loan EMIs can be considered as an investment and not an expense. Upon the completion of the home loan repayment process, you are the genuine owner of the home for property. This means that when the property or home appreciates, this becomes yours to do with however you please.

• When you apply for a home loan, you ensure that the property remains secure for the loan duration. Before your lender approves your home loan application, they run a background check on the structural integrity of the property. They also review the property or home’s legal documentation. By doing this, the lender undertakes the responsibilities that are yours. So, upon approval of your loan application, you only need to worry about the home loan EMI payment. The lender ensures that your property is secure.

• You stand to enjoy certain tax benefits on your home loan. However, you can only claim tax deductions on the principal amount and interest if you mortgaged property against a loan. The Indian Tax Act supports tax benefits on housing loans.

Final Thoughts

Now that you know how a housing loan EMI calculator works, use the Bajaj Finserv home loan calculator to enjoy accurate home loan details. Not only does the lender offer a number of tools for prospective home buyers, it also offers attractive home loan deals, with home loan interest rates starting at 6.75%* p.a. and EMIs starting Rs.649/Lakh*.

Bulls partied hard. The market hit a fresh record highs with the Nifty50 closing above 17,800 mark for the first time and the BSE Sensex surged more than 950 points to move closer to 60,000 mark on September 23, rising 1.6 percent each. Positive global cues and the buying demand across sectors lifted sentiment.

The broader markets also participated in the rally as the Nifty Midcap 100 index was up 1.5 percent and Smallcap 100 index rose 0.78 percent.

Stocks that were in focus included beverage company United Spirits which hit a record high of Rs 843.50, before closing with 7.19 percent gains at Rs 829.15 and diversified NBFC Bajaj Finserv share price decisively crossed Rs 18,000 mark and touched a new high of Rs 18,750 before closing with 5.05 percent gains at 18,503.85. IT services company Mphasis also hit another record high of Rs 3,394 and ended at record closing high of Rs 3,338.60, up 2.69 percent.

Here's what Shrikant Chouhan, Head - Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

United Spirits

After a robust range breakout formation, on September 23 the stock opened with a strong note and registered a fresh all-time high of Rs 843.50. In this month so far, it rallied over 23 percent.

Technically, on daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed breakout continuation formation which is broadly positive for the United Spirits.

For the trend following traders, Rs 800 would be the key support level. Above the same breakout, continuation formation will continue up to Rs 880-925. However, trading below Rs 800 could trigger short term correction up to Rs 750-710.

Bajaj Finserv

On Thursday, the stock opened with a positive note and successfully clear the intraday resistance of Rs 18,000. The strong price volume activity post intraday breakout indicates further uptrend from current levels.

In addition, on daily and intraday charts, the stock has formed promising higher high and higher bottom formation. And on daily and weekly charts, it has formed strong bullish candle which clearly support the short term uptrend.

For the positional traders, Rs 18,000 and Rs 17,700 would be the key support zone. As long as it's trading above the same uptrend formation is likely to continue up to Rs 19,000-19,650. Below 17,700 uptrend would be vulnerable.

Mphasis

On September 23, the stock made yet another all-time high of Rs 3,394. In this month so far, it rallied over 22 percent, the important point is stock not only surpassed its previous 52-week high of Rs 3,270 but comfortably managed sustained above the same.

On daily and weekly charts stock has formed breakout continuation pattern which is grossly positive for the Mphasis. However, on short term time frame, momentum indicators indicate stock is in to the overbought zone and high chances of quick short term price correction is not ruled out if stock trading below Rs 3,180.

For the next few trading sessions Rs 3,180 should be the trend decider level for the bulls, sustain above the same we can expect continuation of uptrend up to Rs 3,500.

Further uptrend may also continue which could lift the stock to Rs 3,750. On the flip side, dismissal of Rs 3,180 could possibly trigger quick short term correction up to Rs 3,000.

Fluctuating markets coupled with unsteady inflation can quickly exhaust your savings if not dealt with properly. However, intelligent investing can work effectively if you avoid high-risk options. Thus, for risk-free investments, fixed deposits are the perfect fit.

A recent study found that more than 95% of Indians preferred investing in fixed deposits over mutual funds and stocks. To ensure good returns, it is important that you pick the right issuer for your fixed deposit.

Bajaj Finserv Fixed Deposit is an excellent option to consider, as it not only guarantees returns but also has myriad benefits on offer. Read on to know what makes it one of the safest investment options and why you should invest in it.

1. Has the highest ICRA and CRISIL ratings

The Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency (ICRA) has credited Bajaj Finance FD with the highest quality credit rating of MAAA. This rating guides and helps investors to make informed decisions by promoting transparency in financial markets. As per this rating by ICRA, this FD is both a stable and safe instrument to invest in.

Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit also has the FAAA (stable) rating from CRISIL. This is another rating that speaks for the safety of this instrument. It serves as a benchmark for investors looking for lucrative options that can promise returns. Both ICRA and CRISIL are leading credit rating agencies, and combining these two ratings, it is clear that this FD is one of the safest options in the market. You are guaranteed timely interest payouts, and you don’t need to worry about returns or defaults.

2. Offers attractive FD rates for all

Corporate fixed deposits generally offer higher fixed deposit interest rates, and Bajaj Finance extends this benefit to you. You can invest your money over a flexible period of 12 months to 60 months and get an interest rate of up to 6.50%. You also get an additional interest benefit of 0.10% over the base rate for applying online.

Effectively, you can get an interest rate of up to 6.60% on an FD of at least 36 months. This is much higher than many other FDs available, which offer interest rates between the 5% and 6% mark. Senior citizens get an additional 0.25% on the base rate to add further value to the offering. Meaning, you can book an FD of at least 36 months and get an interest rate of 6.75%.

For a more detailed understanding of this benefit, consider the following table. Here are expected returns for different investor types on an FD of Rs. 2 lakh over a maturity period of 48 months.

Investor type Rate of interest Interest earned Maturity amount Non-senior citizen investing offline 6.50% Rs. 57,293 Rs. 2,57,293 Non-senior citizen investing online 6.60% Rs. 58,261 Rs. 2,58,261 Senior citizen 6.75% Rs. 59,718 Rs. 2,59,718

During uncertain market conditions, you may not want to commit to a lump sum investment. In such cases, you can opt for the Bajaj Finance Systematic Deposit Plan to make monthly contributions, like you would with an SIP. However, the difference here is that you are investing in a new Bajaj Finance FD every month. As such, you get the safety and security benefits that come with it.

Through the SDP feature, you can start investing with a minimum monthly contribution of Rs. 5,000. Depending on your investment goals, you can opt for the single maturity scheme or the monthly maturity scheme. In the first case, all your maturity proceeds on a fixed date. This is ideal for building a large corpus over a period of time. In this case, the tenor ranges from 19 months to 60 months, and you can make 6 to 47 deposits.

With the monthly maturity scheme, you get maturity proceeds every month. The amount you get is based on the monthly contribution amount and the tenor you choose, ranging between 12 to 60 months. In this case, you can choose to make anywhere between 6 and 48 deposits.

4. Allows you to invest online safely

Bajaj Finance provides you with the luxury of investing online, a safe and secure method of parking your money in an FD. The end-to-end online fixed deposit process covers every step, including payment, through secured portals like Net Banking and UPI.

5. Provides an online loan against the FD

When it comes to picking a safe investment, you can’t go wrong with the Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit. The high credit ratings are a mark of excellence and stability, which you can rely on without any doubts.

Financial services giant Bajaj Finserv on August 24 said it has received in-principle approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for setting up a mutual fund (MF).

“Accordingly, the company would be setting up an Asset Management Company and the Trustee Company, directly or indirectly i.e., itself or through its subsidiary in accordance with applicable SEBI Regulations and other applicable laws,” Bajaj Finserv’s disclosure on exchanges read.

Moneycontrol was the first to report in October 2020 that Bajaj Finserv had applied for an MF licence from SEBI.

The entry of Bajaj Finserv is likely to add to the competitiveness in the industry, which already has 42 MFs. While a large chunk of the market share (57.85 percent of investor assets) is controlled by the top five fund houses, a new entrant such as Bajaj Finserv can gradually gain a solid footing given its wide distribution reach.

Bajaj Finance, its sister concern, has a presence in 2,392 locations, including 1,357 in rural areas, small towns and villages.

This vast branch network can help the MF business to penetrate geographies beyond the top-30 cities, which are known as B-30 locations in industry parlance.

The strategy of Bajaj Finserv or products the mutual fund will focus on are still not clear.

The company is also yet to get final approval from SEBI.

More choices for MF investors

MF investors are suddenly seeing a wave of new fund houses entering the Rs 33 lakh crore MF industry.

To differentiate themselves from existing fund houses, they are trying to innovate and focus on different products for investors.

NJ India, which is the largest MF distributor in India, also received final approval from SEBI to launch its own mutual fund business earlier in the year.

Apart from these, PMS firms are also taking interest in MF business.

Bengaluru-based Capitalmind Wealth and Chennai-headquartered portfolio management service (PMS) provider Unifi Capital have also applied for MF licences.

Another PMS provider – White Oak Capital Management – acquired YES MF in August 2020. The firm is yet to get the final nod from SEBI to start the MF business.

Why is there so much interest in the MF business?

The low penetration of mutual funds in India is the major reason that is prompting financial firms to venture into this industry.

A recent Jefferies report stated that assets under management held by the MF industry are just 12 percent of India’s GDP, whereas the global average is 63 percent. Other developing nations such as Brazil (68 percent of GDP) and South Africa (48 percent of GDP) have much higher proportions of mutual fund investors.",542,0.497596338391304

You can reap the benefit of steady capital appreciation and enjoy the advantages of a safe investment tool with fixed deposit. A substantial amount of money invested in the form of an FD over a longer tenor can yield a generous maturity amount. These expected interest payouts can help you achieve your financial goals and fund unprecedented financial requirements.

While most investors prefer to keep their money invested for the long-term, few others require monetary funds as their regular source of income. Fixed deposit can also be altered according to your financial preferences. Bajaj Finance is one such financier that offers high FD interest rates and assurance of returns at maturity.

Here's why Bajaj Finance online Fixed Deposit is an ideal choice for investors:

Attractive Interest Rates

The FD interest rates offered by Bajaj Finance provides great value to investors. For non-senior citizens these interest rates go up to 6.50%, with an additional 0.10% benefit for investing online. Additionally, senior citizens can enjoy the benefits of interest rates that touch 6.75%.

Bajaj Finance FD provides attractive FD rates for senior citizens, which is a lucrative option for people in this age group. The table given below is an example to show how you can grow your savings by investing in Bajaj Finance FD for different tenors.

Deposit Amount Tenor Applicable Rate of Interest Interest Payout Maturity Amount Rs. 20,00,000 36 months 6.75% Rs. 4,32,953 Rs. 24,32,953 Rs. 40,00,000 48 months 6.75% Rs. 11,94,354 Rs. 51,94,354 Rs. 60,00,000 60 months 6.75% Rs. 23,17,459 Rs. 83,17,459

As a senior citizen, if you invest your life savings of, for instance, Rs. 60,00,000 for just 5 years, you can yield as much as Rs. 23,17,459 at the end of your tenor. You can also choose to get payouts on a periodic basis, if you’re looking for an investment option that helps you meet your recurring expenses.

Loan against FD facility

Although we make long-term plans to save money to fulfil life goals, it is also important to prepare for an unforeseen emergency that warrants a free flow of cash. Bajaj Finance online FD has got that covered as well. Investors can avail of an easy loan against FD that goes up to 75% of the value of your FD. Additionally, there is a provision for withdrawing money prematurely before the tenor of your FD matures, in order to meet your immediate financial needs.

Bajaj Finance online FD scores high on ease of operations and logistics. The entire process of investing in a Bajaj Finance FD can be done through an easy online application process via desktop or mobile, without the hassle of waiting in long queues and submitting multiple documents for verification.

Bajaj Finance Ltd, which has more than doubled in the last year compared to a 55 percent rally in the Nifty50, is back on the buyers’ radar. If the momentum continues, the stock can hit Rs 7,000-8,000 in the medium term, technical experts say.

If we exclude the price action on June 10, the stock underwent consolidation in the first three trading days of the week after the non-bank lender said it could see higher non-performing assets in the first six months of FY22 due to the COVID-induced lockdowns.

The company was providing an update on the impact of the second wave on its financials in FY22.

With daily cases slipping below the 100,000-mark, vaccination picking up pace and the arrival of monsoon, which is expected to be normal, the impact on the economy could be limited.

The Department of Economic Affairs, too, said in its monthly report that the economic impact of the second wave was likely to be restricted to the first quarter.

Bajaj Finance along with seven other stocks in the S&P BSE finance index hit a fresh 52-week high on June 10. Bajaj Finance closed with gains of 7.2 percent on the BSE at Rs 6,087 after hitting a 52-week high of Rs 6115.85.

“Bajaj Finance (BAF) reiterated that financial impact of COVID 2.0 has been much milder vs the first wave, with BAF remaining open for business across all categories,” Morgan Stanley said in a note on June 10 based on takeaways from an investor call.

“While May’21 bore the full impact of localised lockdowns with business volumes declining to 40-60 percent of planned levels, the pick-up in early June 2021 (especially in high-frequency B2B business) has been strong with BAF hoping to reach 75-80 percent of Mar’21 levels post 14th June 2021 with full normalisation by early July,” it said.

The global investment bank has a price target of Rs 6,290 on the stock, which translates into an upside of 3 percent from June 10 closing price of Rs 6,087.

Technical Take

Bajaj Finance made a strong bullish candle on the daily charts. The stock also closed above its five-day exponential moving average on June 10.

“If we look at a larger perspective then it was a much-awaited breakout in the financial giant above the 6,000-mark. Technically, the latest breakout could have a theoretical target of 8,000 but we feel then the stock might start losing momentum near 7,000,” Mehul Kothari, AVP – Technical Research at AnandRathi told Moneycontrol.

“As of now, it is poised for further more upside. We won’t be surprised if we see 7,000 in this series. Support on the downside is placed at Rs 5,500, and a move below the same would halt the entire momentum,” he said.

An undisputed leader in the safety domain has been fixed deposits, guaranteeing the safety and security of the money that is parked, along with a steady rate of capital appreciation.

Why is Fixed Deposit a preferred choice of investment?

You should carefully plan and choose an investment option that aligns with your interests and expectations closely. Fixed deposit offers the dual advantage of the safety of funds and steady capital growth. They remain unaffected by market volatilities, which offer the investor guaranteed returns. Additionally, it is easy to obtain a loan against FD, select a payout plan that suits your financial needs, and renew your FD without much hassle. While a fixed deposit specializes in safety, Bajaj Finance offers a fixed deposit scheme that can help you build your corpus.

Here’s why investing in a Bajaj Finance online FD is a smart choice:

Attractive and assured returns

Bajaj Finance online FD offers some of the most lucrative FD interest rates in the market. Senior citizens can avail an additional 0.25% rate benefit over and above the base rates. An additional 0.10% benefit can be accrued if the investor decides to invest online. A 0.10% rate benefit can prove to be valuable especially if the money is parked for a longer tenor.

Convenient online process

With Bajaj Finance online FD, you simply need to visit the online FD form, verify your details, enter investment details and pay through Net Banking or UPI. Upon successful payment, you’ll receive an acknowledgement regarding the same, and you also receive a Fixed Deposit Receipt (FDR) with details regarding your investment. As a non-senior citizen applying online, you can also benefit from an additional 0.10% rate benefit.

The tabular representation below compares the maturity amounts the investor will accrue for an FD of Rs. 40,00,000 and 50,00,000 for different tenors invested via online and offline mediums.

Thus, you can look at attractive FD rates , with the assurance of guaranteed returns on your deposit. This makes a Bajaj Finance online FD a preferred investment tool for individuals looking to grow their savings easily.

Loan against FD

Though fixed deposit plans have traditionally been long-term investments, an emergency could arise before your FD matures. Such an emergency warrants an immediate need for liquid funds which can be realized by prematurely withdrawing from your FD. If you are resistant to the idea of breaking your FD prematurely, Bajaj Finance offers a simple online loan against FD option that enables you to avail a loan against your fixed deposit, pledging your FD as collateral.

Flexible payout option

Some investors look to park their money in a secure FD and realize long-term gains. Others might prefer to have monthly payouts from their FD that would enable them to pay their monthly bills and EMIs. Depending on your saving preference, Bajaj Finance online FD offers cumulative and non-cumulative fixed deposits. While in the former, the interest is compounded annually but you’re paid at maturity, the latter involves periodic interest payouts, based on your tenor preferences.

Safety of deposit

The safety of a Bajaj Finance FD has been accredited by CRISIL’s FAAA rating and ICRA’s MAAA rating, both indicative of the highest safety standards for your capital.

With the highest safety standards, guaranteed returns, attractive interest rates, availability of loan against FD and the convenience of operations, Bajaj Finance online FD stands as a strong preference for anyone looking to find good investment value for their money.

ICICI Direct's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finserv reported a mixed performance with a gradual pick-up in lending business and robust growth in life insurance while general insurance momentum was slower. Consolidated topline grew 15.7% YoY to Rs 15387 crore, led by improved traction in insurance business, partially offset by moderation in lending business. Consolidated earnings increased 4x YoY to Rs 980 crore with improvement in all segments.

Outlook

We revise our target price to Rs 11500/share (earlier Rs 10500), based on SOTP valuation, implying a multiple of ~26x on FY23E consolidated earnings. However, given recent price run up, we downgrade the stock from BUY to HOLD.

The first aspect to understand is that your credit score can help you get a loan at affordable and desirable terms, helping you save money when it comes to repayment.

Since affordability is key to borrowing smart and catering to your financial health, checking and boosting your credit score should be on your list of healthy financial habits. To know more about how to understand your score, how to check free credit score online and what is control number in CIBIL, read on.

What is your credit score?

Your credit score is a number that displays how creditworthy you are as a borrower. This score is based on your history with credit, which includes how timely you were with repayment, how much you borrowed and how often, what kind of loans you have taken to date, and other related factors. This score is assigned to you by credit information companies like TransUnion CIBIL. Since CIBIL was India’s first credit information company, its score is popularly referred to by both lenders and borrowers. This is why your credit score is sometimes referred to as your CIBIL score.

Your CIBIL score is a number between 300 and 900 and assigned to you based on the data mentioned in your Credit Information Report (CIR), specifically the information present under the Accounts and Enquiries sections. Here’s more on what these sections consist of:

What comes under Account Information in your CIR?

This section lists the monthly record, going back up to 3 years, of all the loans and credit cards you have in your name. Here, you will find the name of the credit facility you have opted for, such as a home loan or car loan, the lender’s name, the date you have taken the loan or credit card, the latest payment date, and the existing debt you need to pay off. It also notes any missing payments of EMIs or credit card bills.

What comes under Enquiry Information in your CIR?

This section lists the lenders requesting information about you as a borrower when you apply for credit. The various credit facilities as well as the estimated loan amount you have applied for can be seen here. For a prospective lender, this section is important because it shows how often you have applied for credit and how many new loans you have been approved for as it helps them check if you can repay additional debt.

How is credit score calculated?

It is important to understand the 4 main aspects of your credit history that make up your score in order of their importance.

1. Your history with payments: Timely payments boost your credit score, and defaults or late payments lower it. So, pay your EMIs and credit card bills on deadline to increase your score.

2. Your frequency of loan enquiries: Many loan enquiries in a short period indicate that you are unable to manage your finances or spending more than you can manage. This lowers your score. Remember, numerous and simultaneous loan or credit card applications make you look credit-hungry.

3. Your credit utilisation behaviour: Your dependency on credit is measured here by seeing if you’re using all or most of your credit limit. Balanced utilisation of credit boosts your sore.

4. Your experience with different types of credit: Also called a credit mix, this section highlights if you have repaid both secured and collateral-free loans. This helps lenders see if you’re an experienced borrower or not. A good credit mix increased your CIBIL score. To Know more ways about How to improve cibil score you can visit Bajaj Finserv Website.

All these aspects contribute to your score, and the score helps lenders decide what your probability of default is likely to be. Usually, a good score is regarded as one that is 750 and above, which means the probability of default is low. This helps you get a competitive rate of interest on a loan, be it unsecured or secured, and help you access the loan amount you want. This is why checking your credit score is important before you apply, so you can understand where you stand. This also helps you work towards improving your score and then applying for a loan to get a better deal.

You may check your credit score for free online in two ways:

1. On the CIBIL website

Check your score for free once annually on the CIBIL website by following these easy steps.

• Click ‘Get Your Free CIBIL Score & Report’

• Create an account by entering your name, email ID, pin code, mobile number and attaching an ID proof online

• Click ‘Accept & continue’ and enter the OTP sent to your phone

• Click ‘Go to Dashboard’ and you’ll be able to check your CIR and credit score

If you want to check your score more than once a year, you will need to pay the subscription fees.

2. On the Bajaj Finserv website

Check your score for free on the Bajaj Finserv website any time without needing to create an account by following these simple steps.

• Click ‘Get Your CIBIL Score

• Enter your name, PAN number, city and employment type as per your official ID proof

• Enter the OTP sent to your phone number and email

• Access the CIBIL score and report

3. What is control number in CIBIL?

Another aspect to keep in mind while you check free credit score online is that CIBIL itself gives you loan offers from various lenders that are customised to your score when you log in using your CIBIL score and control number. The control number is a 10-digit number that is mentioned right at the top of your CIR and you may think of it as a unique ID number.

It is important to understand that as per CIBIL, the number of new loans approved by lenders as per score is as follows:

• For borrowers with a score between 750 and 799: 22.8%

• For borrowers with a score between 800 and 900: 57.6%

Taken cumulatively, this means that more than 80% of new loans have been offered to those with a score above 750.

While CIBIL score isn’t the only aspect that lenders check before approving your loan application, it definitely is one of the important terms of any lender’s eligibility criteria. When you have a good CIBIL score and want to apply for a collateral-free loan whose eligibility criteria are easy to meet, opt for the Bajaj Finserv Personal Loan. It offerss you up to Rs.25 lakh in as few as 24 hours with a simple online application.

Bajaj Finserv on April 28 reported a five-fold jump in the March quarter consolidated profit at Rs 979 crore, driven by the insurance business, against Rs 194 crore in the same quarter last year. The profit on a sequential basis fell 24.1 percent.

The consolidated profit figures for the current quarter and year may not be directly comparable with those of the corresponding periods, the company said.

""Under Ind AS, the insurance subsidiaries have chosen to hold a large part of the equity securities portfolio as fair value through profit and loss account. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significantly larger than normal fall in the value of shares traded on the stock exchanges in Q4 FY20. As on March 31, 2021, the BSE Sensex has rebounded by over 68 percent from March 31, 2020 levels, resulting in higher than normal mark-to-market gain on investments or insurance subsidiaries during FY21. This has resulted in an increase in consolidated profit after tax of Rs 892 crore for FY21 compared to a decrease of Rs 451 crore in Q4 and FY20. The mark-to-market adjustment for Q4 FY21 was not significant,"" the company said.

Consequent to the pandemic, Bajaj Finance has, as a matter of prudence, written off /provided for principal and interest of potentially unrecoverable loans by also utilising the available expected credit loss provision, said Bajaj Finserv, adding it continued to hold a management overlay of Rs 840 crore in provisions, given the dynamic and evolving nature of the pandemic along with other variables.

Bajaj Finance's profit increased by 42.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,347 crore, life insurance business registered a 515.8 percent year-on-year growth in profit at Rs 234 crore but general insurance business' net fell 10.2 percent to Rs 273 crore in Q4FY21.

Bajaj Finserv reported a 15.7 percent growth in the topline at Rs 15,387 crore compared to the year-ago period but it declined 3.6 percent sequentially.

In the financial year FY21, consolidated profit grew by 32.7 percent to Rs 4,470.46 crore and topline jumped 11.5 percent to Rs 60,591.57 crore compared to previous year.

BajajAllianz General Insurance recorded an all-time high annual profit and a robust improvement in its underwriting result, while Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance registered an all-time high annual gross written premium in FY21 at Rs 12,025 crore and its assets under management reached an all-time high of Rs 73,773 crore at year-end, said Bajaj Finserv in its BSE filing.",426,0.5316037961414882

Industrialists welcomed the Maharashtra government's new stricter curbs aimed at containing the virus. Sanjiv Bajaj, chairman & managing director of Bajaj Finserv welcomed the order, while Harsh Goenka, Chairman of RPG Group, urged businessmen to be 'considerate'.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on April 13 announced curfew-like restrictions on public movement over the next 15 days. The CM announced a ban on the movement of people for non-essential works till May 1. The new norms build on the existing weekend and night curfew in the state.

""At a time when consumers will hesitate to buy offline, small businesses look to e-commerce to keep food on the table for their families. Banning Ecommerce (which is safe) at this time, will be soul-crushing for all SMEs in Maharashtra,"" he said.

A fixed deposit is a conventional and trusted savings option offered by banks, non-banking financing companies, or post offices.

Given its popularity as a financial instrument, there are countless providers and options to choose from, but choosing the one that meets all your requirements can be tricky. Bajaj Finance online FD stands out as a smart option, which is attuned to the needs of modern investors, while offering flexibility.

Here’s a look at some reasons why Bajaj Finance online FD should be a part of your investment portfolio.

Attractive Returns

The best part about investing in FDs is that on creation of a fixed deposit account, the returns are not subject to interest rate changes, or market fluctuations. Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit offers fixed deposit rates of up to 7.25%, which are significantly higher than other fixed-income investments.

You can choose tenors from 12 to 60 months, and here’s a look at the range of FD interest rates offered by Bajaj Finance for different tenors.

Tenor (Months) Non senior citizens Senior Citizen FD interest rates 12 – 23 5.98% - 6.15% 6.22% - 6.40% 24 – 35 6.41% - 6.60% 6.64% - 6.85% 36 - 60 6.79% - 7.00% 7.02% - 7.25%

As you can see, interest rates are higher for longer tenors. By choosing tenors of 36 months or more, non-senior citizens get assured returns up to 7% on investing offline, whereas non-senior citizens choosing the online investment mode can get an additional rate benefit of 0.10% on their deposit. Senior citizens get an additional 0.25% rate benefit, regardless of their mode of investment.

Paperless, Hassle-free, Completely Online

Bajaj Finance also offers the convenience of contactless fixed deposits, which enable you to invest from the convenience of your home. By investing in a Bajaj Finance online FD, you can avoid long queues, lengthy documentation processes and benefit from an end-to-end paperless online application method.

Safe, Stable, Credible

These contactless deposits by Bajaj Finance come with the assurance of highest safety and guaranteed returns. Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit is one of the safest investment options as it is accredited with ICRA’s MAAA rating and CRISIL’s FAAA stability rating. Thus, your savings are safe with Bajaj Finance online FD, and you can expect assured returns at maturity.

With Bajaj Finance, there are no restrictions on creating multiple deposits, and you can ladder your deposits easily to cater to your liquidity requirements with ease. To reap additional rate benefits, you can also choose to renew your deposit, and gain 0.10% extra rate benefit. You can also use the FD interest calculator to know the returns on your deposit beforehand

What’s more – you can fully manage and track your investment online with Experia – Bajaj Finserv’s customer portal. There is also an option to avail a Loan against FD during emergencies, and you can also consider renewing your deposit online.

Sharekhan's research report on Bajaj Finserv

ajaj Finserv (BFS, holding company) clocked mixed numbers for Q3FY2021, where operational performance marginally beat expectations; however, higher provisions of Bajaj Finance dampened BFS’ PAT. Insurance subsidiaries BALIC and BAGIC performed well, helped by a net positive impact on PAT on account of post-tax MTM gains from BAGIC & BALIC’s investments of Rs. 384 crore. Bajaj Finance is well capitalised with conservative leverage and both BALIC and BAGIC have healthy solvency ratios and strong operating metrics, with structural tailwinds to benefit them for the long term.

Outlook

We maintain a Buy on Bajaj Finserv with a revised SOTP-based price target (PT) of Rs. 10,860.

Bajaj Finserv reported gradual revival in lending business, while insurance business continued to show healthy performance, though sequential run rate witnessed moderation. Consolidated top-line came at 9.6% YoY at Rs 15960 crore, improved traction sequentially but still lower on YoY basis, due to moderation in lending business. Led by improvement in PAT in insurance business, consolidated earnings came up by 14.6% YoY to Rs 1290 crore.

Outlook

We maintain our target at Rs 10500 per share based on SOTP valuation, implying a multiple of ~22x on FY23E consolidated earnings. Hence, we maintain BUY.

Bajaj Finserv on Wednesday reported a 15 percent rise in its consolidated profit at Rs 1,290 crore for the third quarter ended December. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 1,126 crore in the same period of the financial year 2019-20.

Total income rose to Rs 15,960.72 crore as against Rs 14,561 crore in the year-ago period, Bajaj Finserv said in a release.

Bajaj Finserv is the holding company for various financial services businesses of the Bajaj Group. The company holds 52.74 per cent stake in Bajaj Finance Ltd.

ICICI Direct's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finserv reported a steady performance wherein the insurance business witnessed a pick-up in business activities led by pandemic. However, a cautious approach and concerns on asset quality impacted business momentum and earnings growth. Improved awareness, digitisation and product innovation is expected to keep insurance business momentum healthy. Further, finance business has emerged stronger with a leaner operating model and robust growth guidance of ~25% for FY22E. RBI’s new banking license review allowing NBFCs with asset size of >Rs 50,000 crore and 10 years of existence to apply for banking license and the management’s commentary indicating interest in applying for the same bode well from a long term perspective.

Outlook

This has led to expansion of valuation multiples. Factoring in long term business potential and returning of premium multiple for lending business (contributing 85% to SoTP target), we roll over to FY23E and raise our target to Rs 10500 per share (earlier Rs 7000) based on SOTP valuation, implying a multiple of ~26x on FY23E consolidated earnings. Hence, we maintain BUY.

Further, for the greater part of the last decade home prices in India have remained stable and, in July -September 2020, as per Knight Frank India, housing prices fell by 2-7% YoY in 6 major Indian cities including Delhi-NCR, Chennai, Pune, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Kolkata. These trends paint a pretty picture of the housing landscape, financially speaking, and there may be no time like the present to buy your dream home affordably.

Bajaj Housing Finance Limited (BHFL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bajaj Finance Limited too has announced a reduction in its Home Loan acquisition rate. The new home loan interest rates start at 6.90%*, making 2020’s last quarter a good time to secure the best home loan interest rates in the market. Rate cuts such as this help you borrow more cost-effectively, as the housing loan interest rate is among the chief loan components that decide your monthly and total interest outgo.

Here are some ways in which the drop in the home loan interest rate can benefit you.

1. Service smaller EMIs and pay less home loan interest

The new housing interest rates available in the market are among the lowest home loan interest rates in India that homebuyers can wish to get. Further, the decrease in the housing loan interest rate impacts the EMI and the net interest outgo directly, making home loans more budget-friendly and less of a long-term burden.

Any change made to the current home loan interest rates affects the cost of the loan and to know your EMI and total interest outgo you can use a home loan interest calculator. Below is a table illustrating EMI and net interest calculations, and from it you can see how marginal changes to the home loan interest rate have large long-term consequences.

Loan amount Tenor Interest rate EMI Total interest Rs.1,00,00,000 30 years 6.90% 65,860 1,37,09,606 Rs.1,00,00,000 30 years 7.00% 66,530 1,39,50,889 Rs.1,00,00,000 30 years 7.10% 67,203 1,41,93,150

2. Pick a shorter repayment duration as per your convenience

With low-interest home loans, you can also afford to tweak the principal and tenure to arrive at an EMI structure that favours your debt-to-income ratio. Normally, shorter tenures are preferred as they reduce your total interest outgo, but these leave you with large EMIs. However, now, with the reduction in the home loan interest rate you can service your loan over a shorter tenure without worrying too much about inflated EMIs.

With the home loan interest rates today being lower, you can consider solutions like the Bajaj Housing Finance Limited Home Loan, which offers funding up to Rs.3.5 crore for a flexible tenor of up to 30 years and pick the tenor and loan amount as per your convenience.

3. Make prepayments to save more on total interest

With a new home loan or a floating rate home loan, you benefit greatly when the interest rate drops. In fact, with less EMI outgo, you may find yourself with surplus money, which you can funnel towards, say, an annual part-prepayment. The advantage of clearing a portion of the principal early is that each part-prepayment has a ripple effect, the result of which is huge interest savings in the long run. Moreover, there are no prepayment charges on floating interest rate home loans taken by individual borrowers.

4. Take a top-up loan or carry out a balance transfer

Lenders like Bajaj Housing Finance Limited extend Top-up Loans at rates marginally higher than the present home loan interest rates. With low home loan rates across the board you can apply for funding over and above your home loan to meet personal, housing, or business goals on cost-effective terms.

Likewise, if you are seeking to lower your outgo with the new home loan interest rates, you can consider a home loan balance transfer after conducting a cost-benefit analysis.

In addition to the reduction in the home loan interest rate, remember that with Bajaj Housing Finance Limited, you can also claim PMAY interest subsidies on fresh Home Loans, as per your eligibility and, as a borrower, you can reduce your tax liability by claiming an annual home loan interest tax benefit.

With lower EMIs and the possibility of repaying your home loan faster, you should consider taking a housing loan for your dream home now.

Bajaj Housing Finance Limited offers interest rates starting at 6.90%* and to get a Home Loan you can apply online today!

Sharekhan's research repor on Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finserv’s (BFS; holding company) results for Q2FY2021 were mixed; Income from operations came above estimates, but PAT declined by 19.9% y-o-y (below estimates).. Lending business, Bajaj Finance Limited’s (BFL) Q2FY2021 results were mixed. Operational numbers were in-line with estimates and asset quality improved sequentially. However, higher provisions (taken on prudent basis for Stage 1 and 2 loans) due to upfronting of provisions impacted PAT. Insurance subsidiary, BAGIC posted strong results, (helped by lower claims) in motor OD; BALIC’s PAT declined (due to higher new business strain; absence of capital gains seen in Q2FY2020); but healthy APE growth is encouraging.

Outlook

The ~40% holding company discount to Bajaj Finserv’s valuations make risk return attractive. We maintain our Buy rating with an unchanged SOTP-based PT of Rs. 7,500.

KRChoksey's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Revenue from operations rose by ~6%YoY/ QoQ at INR 15,050 Cr. The insurance businesses grew 20% YoY, but the revenues at the NBFC were muted. Provision fell marginally by 1% QoQ to INR 1,660 Cr. PAT were lower by 18% YoY/QoQ as costs savings accrued. PAT for BALIC grew 13% YoY even as gross written premium degrew 3% YoY on account of cost saving, some of them structural. PAT for BAGIC fell 53% Y-o-Y to INR 977 Mn on account of higher new business strain and lower capital gains even as there are structural savings in costs. PAT/PPOP and NII did not grow on a sequential basis.

Outlook

We have used SoTP approach to arrive at a target of INR 8,203 (3.0x P/EV for BALIC on FY22E EVPS; 3.0x P/B for BAGIC on FY22E; 15x P/E for Windmill assets; and 6.2x P/ABV on FY22E for BFL); indicating an upside of 40% over CMP. Accordingly, we reiterate our “BUY” recommendation on the shares of Bajaj Finserv.

The status of MF applications disclosed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) shows that Bajaj Finserv had applied for an MF license on September 28, 2020.

Entering a crowded space

The entry of Bajaj Finserv is likely to add to the competitive intensity of the MF industry, which already has 40 fund houses. While a large chunk of the market share (57.85 per cent of investor assets) is controlled by the top five fund houses, a new entrant such as Bajaj Finserv can gradually gain a solid footing given its wide distribution reach.

Bajaj Finance, its sister concern, has presence in 2,392 locations, including 1,357 in rural areas, small towns and villages.

This vast branch network can help the MF business to penetrate geographies beyond the top-30 cities, which are known as B-30 locations in industry parlance.

Bajaj Finserv as a group is also known for providing quality digital services to customers.

Making a sizeable dent in the market share may be difficult in the short term despite the group’s wide reach.

“With MFs, investors tend to prefer known names. This is the reason why new entrants could take time to build market share. However, a domestic player looking at the MF business is a positive sign; it shows fund management makes business sense despite so many changes in the industry,” says Joydeep Sen, an independent MF expert.

An e-mail query sent to Bajaj Finserv regarding the type of funds it hopes to offer didn’t elicit any response.

Back in 2011, Bajaj Finserv had received SEBI's nod to set-up a mutual fund business, but the MF arm was never launched.

Recently, NJ India Invest and Samco Securities had received in-principle approval from the market regulator for starting the MF business. Applications from Zerodha Broking and Frontline Capital Services are still being reviewed by SEBI.",325,0.3010707855224609

Bajaj Finserv managing director Sanjiv Bajaj on July 29 backed HDFC chief Deepak Parekh's view that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should not extend the loan moratorium, saying six months were a long enough period.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Bajaj said, ""I fully support what Deepak Parekh has said. We have now had a total of six months available for moratorium by September, and as we know, the economy has started picking up from last month at varying speeds because of local lockdowns creating issues, but it is picking up other than a few key sectors which we know --hospitality, travel, entertainment--are facing very high challenges. But most others have started at least doing okay. So, at a time like this, I also believe that it doesn’t make sense to extend a blanket moratorium.”

The RBI should allow one-time restructuring rather than extending the moratorium, he said.

""Instead, allow a one-time restructuring. Let lenders decide on the basis of each one’s own underlying cash flows because eventually, we have to keep in mind that there is a cost to doing all this and somebody has to bear that cost,"" Bajaj said

""A six-month moratorium is long enough, beyond that will start creating a moral hazard that even reasonable quality borrowers will lose the habit of paying and we do not want that,"" he said.

Speaking about credit cost, he said, ""Our latest presentation talks of a Rs 6,300 crore number. Right now this is the best estimate the team can do, it is about a Rs 6,300 number for the year. You have to keep in mind that we took about Rs 900 crore in Q4 last year. So, Rs 7,200 crore is what we see at this stage.""

Bajaj also said the company was adequately capitalised with the Rs 8,500 crore raised last year. ""We were fortunate that last year November we went and raised capital in Bajaj Finance. As you know, our two insurance companies do not need it, we have significant capital on the books over there from profits of earlier years, but Bajaj Finance, ideally we would have been raising money at this point of time, but I think we were just fortunate,"" Bajaj added.

""We raised Rs 8,500 crore last year and with that our tier-I today is 23-24 percent. So, unless all hell breaks loose where we have bigger problems than a country and an economy, I think we are very comfortable,"" he said.

Note: Replugging this column after Rahul Bajaj resigned as the chairman of Bajaj Auto on April 29, 2021.

For a man who is believed to have said “Only fools retire”, Rahul Bajaj’s stepping down as chairman of Bajaj Finance may seem a bit odd. Still sprightly at 82 and sharp as ever, will the man who turned his fledgling family business into Humara Bajaj, be content with a seat at the family dining table?

The release from the company was carefully worded: “Rahul Bajaj, non-executive chairman of the company, having been at the helm since its inception in 1987 and the group for over five decades, as part of succession planning, has decided to demit the office”.

The reference to succession planning holds the key not just to this decision but also the man’s singular achievement that goes beyond just the numbers.

Indeed, Rahul Bajaj’s single biggest accomplishment might have been the smooth transfer of his power to his sons and then in turn the bifurcation of business interests between the two of them.

No stranger to simmering discontent between siblings which in the past led to a bitter parting with his own brother, last year, he engineered a family settlement with his cousins, Shekhar, Madhur and Niraj, that laid down the terms of joint ownership of group companies along with a formal process to handle any future conflicts.

Plan this way

What’s more, he has also made sure that his sons are free from any such tensions.

With that the senior Bajaj has laid out a perfect template for Indian business families on how they can enhance value from one generation to another.

Defying the unwritten rules of Indian business families, it is the fourth generation of the Bajaj family, led by Rajiv and Sanjiv, which has grown the empire the most and created enormous shareholder wealth in the bargain.

Today, three Bajaj group firms, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Auto rank among the 35 most valuable companies in the country.

It was in 1968 that Rahul Bajaj took over the small family business of scooters, cement and electrical appliances from his father Kamalnayan Bajaj who in turn had inherited it from his father Jamnalal Bajaj whose contribution to India’s freedom struggle far exceeds that to Indian business.

Through the 1970s and 1980s, Rahul Bajaj turned the company into a household name stretching the business to the limits permitted by the asphyxiating license-permit raj of the era.

When liberalisation came, the feisty, outspoken business leader was among those who raised their voice against the sudden assault of foreign capital and technology and asked for no more than a level playing field.

Soon enough though, the canny businessman figured out the new rules of the game and played it better than most. By the late 90s, Bajaj Auto was once again king of the Indian roads.

But here’s where Rahul Bajaj departed from the time-honoured script for successful patriarchs. He knew when it was time for him to step back. With both his sons having apprenticed long enough on the shop floor, the man who had built the company into a two-wheeler giant transitioned smoothly into a mentor and guide, leaving operational control to them.

A good call

It was a wise and ultimately enriching decision.

Rajiv, the elder of the two and the appointed heir to the two-wheeler business, steered it out of a mini-slump following the onslaught of motorcycles in which arch-rival Hero Honda took the lead.

Soon though Bajaj had recovered lost ground and in 2009, the company took the momentous, though at that time highly, questionable decision to exit the scooters business. Subsequent events show that what the company lost on market share it made up in profitability.

But it is the newer business of financial services that has proved to be a bonanza for the group.

Outspoken and frank in public, Rahul Bajaj is anything but reckless in his business. Even as many Indian businessmen flamed out following ill-thought through forays into disparate businesses, Bajaj stuck to knitting through the company’s healthy balance sheet, allowing it to constantly explore related opportunities. Financial services were an integral part of that diversification strategy.

Though the entry into this business was largely Rahul Bajaj’s idea (in 2001, the company signed up with Allianz SE to start a general insurance business) he left it to Sanjiv to grow it the way he thought best.

To Sanjiv’s credit after 10 years learning the ropes of the two-wheeler business, his ability to make a success of the financial business turning Bajaj Finance into one of the largest retail asset financing NBFCs in the country, is a remarkable feat.

Just as the evolution from the Bajaj Chetak to the Pulsar bike marks a generational shift in the group’s two-wheeler business, the emergence of a powerful financial services entity whose market cap dwarfs that of the original entity Bajaj Auto marks an equally successful diversification.

In both these, Rahul Bajaj provided the ballast and more significantly the original impetus by empowering his sons at the right time and giving them distinct lines of business to run.

Sharekhan's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finserv (holding company) saw its consolidated net profit rise by 43.7% to Rs 1,215 crore, while revenue increased 15.6% y-o-y to Rs 14,190 crore in Q1 FY21 mainly helped by strong earnings from its insurance subsidiaries. Bajaj Finance (lending subsidiary) saw tepid AUM growth, but asset quality improved q-o-q and moratorium book share declined to 15.7% (from 27% earlier). Insurance arms saw strong PAT growth helped by lower claims and strong cost management. Even though Q1 topline was impacted by COVID-19 as expected, pick-up on a month-on-month basis on premiums is encouraging, reflecting rapid normalisation. All subsidiaries are well-capitalised with strong operating metrics, which will enable them withstand and tide over near-term challenges.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy recommendation on Bajaj Finserv with a revised SOTP-based price target of Rs. 7,500.

ICICI Direct's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finserv reported steady traction in its lending business. Slower premium accretion in insurance got offset by strong investment gains. Higher topline coupled with lower claims & cost control led earnings. Consolidated topline came in at 15.6% YoY to Rs 14192 crore, primarily led by a healthy performance in lending business & strong investment income in insurance business. Lending arm Bajaj Finance made a contingent provision of Rs 1450 crore amid Covid-19 though lower opex in lending business and fall in claims led to 13.8% YoY increase in consolidated PBT to Rs 2568 crore. Hence, consolidated PAT was at Rs 1215 crore, up 43.7% YoY.

Outlook

We maintain HOLD with a revised TP of Rs 6400, based on SOTP valuation, implying multiple of ~21x FY22E consolidated earnings.

The share price of Bajaj Finserv jumped almost 4 percent while those of Bajaj Finance fell 3 percent in the morning trade on BSE on July 22, a day after the two companies announced their June quarter results.

Bajaj Finserv reported a nearly 44 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in Q1 FY21 consolidated net profit at Rs 1,215 crore. On a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis, profit jumped over six times.

Consolidated total income for the quarter under review stood at Rs 14,192 crore, up 16 percent YoY. On a QoQ basis, income was down 7 percent.

However, the company's arm Bajaj Finance's consolidated profit after tax dropped 19 percent YoY to Rs 962 crore. Total income for Q1 FY21 increased 14 percent to Rs 6,650 crore.

Bajaj Finance made a pre-tax provision of Rs 1,450 crore in the form of contingency provision during Q1 FY21 on account of the impact of COVID-19.

""The same is over and above the provision of Rs 900 crore in FY20 and other usual and necessary provisions for non-performing assets (NPAs),"" Bajaj Finserv said.

Assets under management (AUM) of Bajaj Finance, as of June 30, stood at Rs 1,38,055 crore, an increase of 7 percent YoY. ""This includes an AUM of Rs 32,982 crore for its housing finance subsidiary, Bajaj Housing Finance, a 52 percent growth YoY,"" the company said.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a 'neutral' call on Bajaj Finance with a target price of Rs 3,000.

Motilal said Bajaj Finance reported a largely in-line quarter, barring the surprise on fee income and MTM gains.

""We have upgraded fees and other income estimates by ~20%, leading to a PPoP upgrade of 3–4 percent. However, due to an increase in provisioning estimates, PAT estimates are largely unchanged,"" Motilal said.

The company has guided for continued cost rationalisation and focus on fees in the near-term to navigate earnings pressure.

""AUM growth is likely to be 10–12 percent for FY21 and provisioning expenses would be Rs 6,000–6,300 crore. We bake-in provisions of Rs 6,600 crore (4.3 percent of loans) for FY21,"" Motilal said.

At 1005 hours, shares of Bajaj Finserv were trading 2.85 percent up at Rs 6,563.55 while those of Bajaj Finance were 0.21 percent down at Rs 3,286 on BSE.

ICICI Direct's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finserv reported a steep fall in earnings due to lower premium accretion coupled with surge in Covid related contingent provision & MTM losses on equity investment. Consolidated topline was flat at 2% YoY to Rs 13294 crore, primarily led by slower traction in premium accretion in insurance business that was offset by healthy traction in lending business. Bajaj Finance, lending arm, made a contingent provision of Rs 900 crore amid Covid-19, while insurance business took a MTM hit of Rs 768 crore on equity investment, led by steep decline in value of equity market. This has led to a 63% YoY decline in PBT to Rs 793 crore. Resultantly, consolidated PAT came at Rs 194 crore, down 77% YoY. Excluding the provision for Covid-19, PAT would have been Rs 1000 crore.



Outlook

Management’s focus to remain profitable on underwriting basis rather than investment income provides confidence. Factoring the changed scenario, we cut our earnings estimates by ~18% for FY22E. Lower growth & higher uncertainty on asset quality warrant being cautious in near term till clarity on lockdown and moratorium behaviour emerges. Hence, we downgrade the stock to HOLD with revised target price of Rs 4800/share, based on SOTP valuation, implying a multiple of ~16x on FY22E consolidated earnings.

Sharekhan's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finserv posted weak Q4FY2020 results, primarily due to the lockdown (that impacted revenues) and high provisions (COVID-19 and MTM impact) that hit profitability of its subsidiaries. Lending subsidiary Bajaj Finance Ltd (BFL) reported mixed Q4FY20 numbers, with a spike in provisions (mainly due to COVID-19 related provisions and one-offs), which led to PAT lagging expectations. Despite near-term headwinds, sound fundamentals of business franchises are likely to sustain in present times as well.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy recommendation on Bajaj Finserv with a revised SOTP-based price target of Rs. 5,322.

Diversified NBFC Bajaj Finserv on May 21 said its consolidated net profit for March quarter stood at Rs 194.4 crore. It was down significantly by 77 percent compared to Rs 838.7 crore in year-ago period due to contigency provisions for COVID-19. But it was supported by lower tax cost (down 64 percent YoY).

Bajaj Finserv is the holding company for various financial services businesses under the Bajaj group.

Insurance companies had an unrealised mark-to-market (MTM) pre-tax loss of Rs 768 crore in the consolidated financials and additionally, Bajaj Finance made a pre-tax provision off Rs 900 crore in the form of contingency provision on account of the impact of COVID-19.

The company said the profit ex-COVID impact stood at Rs 1,001 crore, increased by 19.4 percent compared to Rs 838.7 crore in the same period last year.

Consolidated revenue from operations grew by 2.3 percent year-on-year to Rs 13,295 crore in the quarter ended March 2020.

In the financial year 2019-20, profit grew by 4.7 percent Rs 3,369.13 crore, the highest annual profit for the sixth consecutive year, and revenue increased 27.6 percent to Rs 54,346.69 crore compared to the previous year.

The stock has rallied more than 200 percent in the last five years in absolute terms and has also outperformed the S&P BSE Sensex each year. The stock was trading at Rs 1,427 on April 1, 2015.

Kotak Securities highlighted Bajaj Finserv in its weekly report ‘Pick of the week’ segment. The domestic brokerage placed a 12-month target of Rs 7,150 on the stock, an upside of about 50 percent from Rs 4,747 recorded on April 22.

Bajaj Finserv’s partnership with Axis Bank will likely provide some upside to volumes and improve operating leverage, not factored at this stage, the note said.

Lower ULIPs volumes, mostly in FY21E, will likely put pressure on VNB growth for the year. However, Kotal Institutional Equities (KIE) expects both life and non-life businesses to benefit from higher demand for protection in the current environment.

The current holding company discount of Bajaj Finance is probably at the peak, said the note. The current discount appears at the highest level when compared with year-end data points.

This provides two solid levers for stock price appreciation--reduction in holding-company discount and appreciation in the stock price of Bajaj Finance, the note said.

The uncertainty over the lockdown and collection behaviour will prompt Bajaj and all lenders to slow down new loans. KIE has always liked the franchise of Bajaj Finance and management of the company, though high valuations had held back from having a more aggressive stock view

KIE continues to remain assertive on Bajaj Finance’s ability to get back on the growth track even though FY21E is likely to be weak.

KIE expects the Bajaj Finance stock to trade at 3.6X March 2022E. It remains the key value driver contributing to about 66 percent to Bajaj Finserv’s SOTP. KIE upgraded the stock to “buy” from “add”.

Another brokerage firm, Sharekhan, also maintains its “buy” rating on Bajaj Finserv with a target price of Rs 6,800. The brokerage is of the view that both Life and General Insurance businesses have healthy solvency ratios and strong operating metrics.

“We have revised our estimates of subsidiaries to factor in the rising risks and accordingly have adjusted the valuation multiples,” it said.

Bajaj Finserv has consistently seen strong performance from its lending business. All three of Bajaj Finserv’s businesses are strong franchises and are well poised to deliver sustainable profitability going forward.

“We believe that weakness in the stock may be an opportunity for investors to add it to their long term portfolio. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with a revised SOTP-based PT of Rs. 6800,” said the note.

And with unprecedented situations such as the ongoing lockdown in place, it is important that customers have the means to access financing without visiting a branch or even leaving their home.

This is exactly what lenders such as Bajaj Finserv are offering. Today, eligible customers can access instant funding through personalised pre-approved personal loan offers that can be availed in minutes. This 100% online personal loan offering can be a very useful option if you need money at a moment’s notice.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you can access an Instant Personal Loan from Bajaj Finserv.

1.Check your pre-approved offer

The first step is to check your pre-approved offer from Bajaj Finserv. All customers who have an existing relationship with the NBFC are assigned a pre-approved offer. If you have a pre-approved offer, your personal loan eligibility is already accounted for and this includes factors like your CIBIL score, income, age and others. This means that you do not have to calculate your eligibility or submit any documents for verification. The no-paperwork process makes the loan easy to get.

2.Review your details

Rather than filling out a lengthy application form, as an existing customer with a pre-approved offer, all you need to do is review a pre-filled form with all your details along with the loan amount. Then you can simply get the loan, which is kept ready for you, without any hassles whatsoever using the 100% digital process.

3.Accept the terms of the offer and await disbursal

Once you’re satisfied with the offer, all you have to do is accept the terms and authorise disbursal. Since it is a fully digital process, you don’t have to worry about visiting any physical branch as the entire sanction will get disbursed to you within 20 minutes. All it takes is just 2 clicks, and you can have the money in your bank account without stepping out of your home.

What can you use the Bajaj Finserv Instant Personal Loan for?

Now that you know how easy it is to avail Personal Loan from Bajaj Finserv, keep in mind that this loan doesn’t require any collateral or have any spending restrictions. The high loan amount also ensures that you can use it to meet your needs without compromise or delay.

1. Address medical emergencies

Medical emergencies usually demand large amounts of finance fast. With the Instant Personal Loan from Bajaj Finserv, you can get the loan amount without any stress in just 20 minutes so you can opt for the best medical services in your area of residence immediately.

2.Consolidate any existing high-interest credit

With the economic scenario being what it is, consolidating high-interest debt such as your credit card debt is a smart decision. This helps you avoid paying high penalties and accumulating interest on various deadlines, and instead helps you club all debt into one monthly EMI. Choosing an Instant Personal Loan from Bajaj Finserv also helps you repay comfortably over a lengthy tenor up to 5 year, and benefit from competitive personal loan interest rates. Doing this can also help you enjoy more liquidity during a cash crunch, which is common in these times.

3.Renovate or improve your workspace at home

With work from home becoming a norm these days, it is important to have the right set-up. A productive environment helps you stay focused, stay healthy, and increases your efficiency. A smart way to utilise an Instant Personal Loan is to invest in functional furniture and electronics such as ergonomic chair, a desk, or even a laptop or smart TV so you can participate in conference calls, make presentations, and carry out all manner of work seamlessly.

4.Invest in self-development and self-improvement

Another clever way to put the funds from an Instant Personal Loan to good use is to invest in yourself and add to your skillsets. This can be easily achieved by signing yourself up for specialised courses online from leading educational institutions in India or from across the world. With the right certification, you can take your career to the next level.

With zero paperwork, a 100% digital processes, and a fast disbursal in just 20 minutes, the Instant Personal Loan from Bajaj Finserv is an ideal source of finance during a lockdown. To get started now, check your pre-approved offer today and avail a personal loan instantly and hassle-free!

Bajaj Finserv on March 13 has issued a public notice for auction of gold articles of Bajaj Finance (BFL). It notified defaulters that gold ornaments submitted at the time of availing the gold loan would be auctioned at the mentioned venues and dates from 10 am onwards.

Multiple accounts across 52 locations in the country have been mentioned. The move comes after these customers 'defaulted' on their loan repayments or 'failed to provide the required margin' despite repeated notices, the notice read.

The notice issued in newspapers said: “It is hereby notified by BFL to all concerned and the general public that gold ornaments submitted by customers to Bajaj Finance at the time of availing the gold loan, in the below-mentioned accounts will be auctioned on an ""as is where is basis and as is what is basis"" at below venue from 10.00 AM for below-mentioned loan accounts of customers who have defaulted in repayment of the loan amount or have failed to provide the required margin despite repeated notices.”

Bidders are requested to make a cash deposit of Rs 25,000 as earnest money on the day of the auction. Earnest money deposit is an amount a buyer pays to show their genuine interest in purchase. Bidders are also required to carry a valid ID Card/PAN Card at the auction venue.

The complete terms and conditions (T&Cs) pertaining to this public auction have been posted online here. The notice states that submission of bid “is construed as a deemed acceptance to the said T&Cs.”

Lenders usually undertake auctions when “push comes to shove”. While this is the last resort, banks can rightfully take possession of the collateral and auction it to recover the loan amount.",297,-0.9150950908660889
2020-02-10 14:55:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/announcements/a-guide-to-budget-2020-for-fd-investors-4927061.html,"The Union Budget for 2020 is out and while most expected a relaxation in personal income tax laws, the dual tax regime system proposed has left many wondering what to do next. As a fixed deposit investor, getting a grip on what Budget 2020 means for your finances is crucial as failure to do so would be akin to driving without a roadmap or knowing where your destination lies. Determining the investment route for the year should begin with picking one of the tax regimes and then making appropriate investment decisions.

To help you in this regard, here’s an investor’s guide to Budget 2020.

Choose one of the two tax regimes

When it comes to picking between the two tax regimes, there is no one-size-fits-all approach that works. The decision depends not only on your annual income and salary structure, but on factors such as your risk profile, fixed obligations, investment habits, and goals.

Selecting the right tax regime for you is also crucial as it forms the playground for your fixed deposit investments. To get a better understanding of which one to pick, consider the following table. Here, an assumption is made that your annual income is Rs. 10 lakh and a few figures have been assumed to be exemptions and deductions to illustrate the impact they have on the taxes you pay.

Particulars Scenario #1 Scenario #2 Scenario #3 Annual income Rs.10,00,000 Rs.10,00,000 Rs.10,00,000 HRA exemption Rs.1,00,000 Rs.1,00,000 - Standard deduction Rs.50,000 Rs.50,000 Rs.50,000 80C deduction Rs.1,50,000 Rs.50,000 - 80 CCD deduction Rs.50,000 - - Gross taxable income - new/ old Rs.10,00,000/ Rs.6,50,000 Rs.10,00,000/ Rs.8,00,000 Rs.10,00,000/ Rs.9,50,000 New: Tax @ 15% + 4% cess (A) 78,000 78,000 78,000 Old: Tax @ 20% + 4% cess (B) 44,200 75,400 1,06,600 Profit/ loss with new regime (B-A) -Rs.33,800 -Rs.2,600 Rs.28,000 Verdict Old regime offers savings Old regime offers marginal savings New regime saves tax

These figures are applicable for FY 20–21 and you’ll note that your tax savings differ greatly depending on how much you are able to leverage the available exemptions and deductions. Given this scenario, see the two options you have below.

Invest in FD for assured returns

If you’re adept at diverting your income towards tax-saving vehicles, then you can invest in a fixed deposit to utilise the Section 80C deduction limit. A bank FD would help you do this and what makes this option even more attractive is the 5-fold hike in the insurance coverage from DIGC, as announced by Budget 2020.

However, it is wholly possible that when it comes to Section 80C, you have your bases covered with investments in Public Provident Fund, National Savings Certificate, or Tax-saving mutual funds. In this case, it’s more profitable to go for a company FD like Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit, where you get generous FD interest rates of up to 8.10% for new customers and up to 8.35% for senior citizens. Bajaj Finance is also one of the safest investment avenues, with the highest ratings of FAAA by CRISIL and MAAA by ICRA.

Why now is the right time to invest in FD?

Post the Budget 2020, you may find a greater scope to put your savings to better use. While equity markets are surging now, there is always scope for market volatility, with an element of higher risk. This leaves safe options like FD, PPF and government savings schemes, for you to invest in.

However, speculations about a reduction in interest rates for PPF and savings schemes are rife, which makes fixed deposit a lucrative investment option. With facilities like Systematic Deposit Plan for regular savers seeking monthly starting Rs. 5000 per month, FDs are a great way to grow your savings.

While you can invest over a flexible tenor, the rates peak when you choose a longer tenor, which can also help you earn a higher interest income. Moreover, you can use the Multi-deposit feature to invest in several FDs of different tenors, using a single cheque, and thereby align your investments to your goals. To enjoy long-term gains, you can use the Auto-renewal facility and reinvest at maturity in a hassle-free manner, while enjoying a better rate of return.

So, there you have it! Irrespective of which regime you opt for, you can use a vehicle like the Bajaj Finance FD to grow your wealth and enhance your portfolio's worth. To start today, simply book an online FD by filling a short form.

Sharekhan's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finserv (BFS; Holding company) posted healthy Q3FY2020 results primarily due to strong performance of its lending subsidiary Bajaj Finance Limited (BFL). Bajaj Allianz General Insurance (BAGIC; general insurance) had a weak quarter with rise in combined ratio (COR, less is better) due to losses from the crop segment and higher claim ratio from the motor OD segment. Overall, positive performance in BALIC, healthy operating matrix in BAGIC and consistency of Bajaj Finance makes it an attractive franchise.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with a revised SOTP-based price target (PT) of Rs. 11,000.

Factors that impact your home loan interest rates include –

• Down Payment

The initial payment which you need to make when availing a home loan is a down payment. The down payment you can make is a major determinant for the applicable interest rate on your home loan. Down payment and interest rates are inversely proportional, i.e. a lower down payment ascertains a higher interest rate. It is because financiers have to bear a higher risk on account of paying a larger proportion of the property value.

• Income Stability

Your income stability is an essential factor in the determination of home loan interest rates. The financer would base your repayment capacity on it. An inconsistent income curve, which can either be due to disparate revenue generation from your business or frequent employment changes, would affect the interest rates on your home loan.

• Interest Rate Type

There are two types of interest rates – floating and fixed. Floating rates vary during repayment tenor based on market conditions. Fixed rates, as the name suggests, remain constant throughout the tenor. In most cases, floating rates on home loans are lower than fixed interest rates. However, both the rates have their respective advantages and disadvantages. You can choose between a fixed and floating rate based on your convenience.

• Property Location

Interest rates also depend on the location of the property which you will purchase using a home loan. In case your property is located in a remote area, the financer may levy a higher interest rate and vice versa. It is because a convenient location would enable the lender to liquidate the property without much hassle in the event you are unable to repay your loan; whereas property in a remote location would be more difficult to liquidate increasing their cost. To account for that spread, financial institutions levy a higher interest rate.

These are the factors which you should consider when availing a home loan.

Factors which Affect Credit Score

1. Repayment History – Your repayment history represents your consistency regarding payment of credit dues. These dues include EMIs for existing or past loans you have availed and your credit card bills.

2. Credit Mix – Your credit score is also computed based on your credit portfolio. If you have a healthy mix of secured and unsecured credit facilities on account of which you make consistent repayments, it represents your sound manageable quality and vice versa.

3. Credit Utilisation Ratio – It is the percentage of utilisation of your eligible limit on your credit card. In case you exhaust your limit or use more than 30% of such limit regularly, it represents you as a credit hungry individual and consequently affects your credit score.

Even though credit score does not significantly affect your home loan eligibility, it acquires considerable weight in the determination of interest rates. Therefore, you should know what the best credit score for a home loan is and how to improve yours.

Maintain a high score and refer to a leading lender for the most beneficial loan terms if you are a prospective borrower. If you are an existing borrower, simply repay your loan as per the EMIs and try to add prepayment as well.

2020-01-10 17:57:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/announcements/save-with-monthly-fds-with-systematic-deposit-plan-by-bajaj-finance-4804681.html,"With a deposit book of more than 18000 crores and more than 2,50,000 loyal customers, Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit offers one of the best interest rates of up to 8.35%. Those looking to invest in FD need to set aside a huge deposit amount, so they can reap the benefit of both – safety and returns. However, for those who want the convenience of small monthly savings, Bajaj Finance is offering Systematic Deposit Plan.

This unique, industry-first feature allows you to save small amounts every month and so, does away with the requirement for one, large initial deposit. Though the concept of an SDP runs parallel to that of a Systematic Investment Plan in many ways, Systematic Deposit Plan (or SDP) is a safer option as it pertains to an instrument that carries no risk.

To learn more about functionalities and features of SDP, read on.

Convenience of SIPs with guaranteed returns

As mentioned, SDPs eliminate the need for a sizeable initial deposit. Here you can march towards your goals by taking smaller, approachable steps as you can make a monthly deposit of as little as Rs. 5,000. While the 1st payment must be made by cheque, you can automate the rest through an ECS mandate. The electronic NACH transaction can be carried out on the 3rd, 7th or the 12th of the month.

The small minimum deposit amount allows you to keep the bulk of your salary in your bank account for instant liquidity, and reserve a portion for higher returns without damaging your cash flow. Also, you get guaranteed returns, so you need not fear the loss of capital.

Ladder your investments with attractive returns

The Systematic Deposit Plan is a unique savings plan, which helps you earn handsome returns of up to 8.35% for senior citizens and up to 8.10% for regular investors. Further, with an SDP, each time you make a deposit, a new fixed deposit is created and you earn interest as per the rates prevailing on the transaction date.

Alongside attractive yields, you also enjoy certainty and safety, as you look forward to growing your wealth as per your forecast. Returns are backed by the highest ratings of FAAA by CRISIL and MAAA by ICRA, as well as S&P Global’s BBB- rating.

Choose the number of deposits and tenor

Since a new deposit is created with every payment, laddering is an inherent part of using this smart saving tool. By setting the right tenor for your deposits you can align your FDs to your short- and long-term goals. You can choose a tenor between 12 and 60 months for each deposit, and make anywhere from 6 to 48 deposits, depending on your financial flexibility and goals. With the help of this mechanism, you gain liquidity after the first deposit matures and post that, you earn proceeds every month thanks to the fact that your deposits are laddered.

To understand what your returns will amount to, as a new customer, take a look at the following table.

Deposit amount per month (in Rs.) Deposit tenor (in months) Number of deposits Interest earned on each deposit (in Rs.) Total interest earned (in Rs.) Monthly payout (in Rs.) Total payout (in Rs.) 5,000 12 12 380 4,560 5,380 64,560 5,000 24 12 821 9,852 5,821 69,852 5,000 36 12 1,316 15,792 6,316 75,792

From the above table, you can deduce that if you make 12 deposits of Rs. 5000, which will amount to a total amount of Rs. 60,000, you can earn an interest of Rs. 380 per month if you choose a tenor of 12 months for each of your deposits. Similarly, if you choose a tenor of 24 months for each of your deposits, you can gain an interest of Rs. 821 per month; and on choosing tenor of 36 months, gain an interest of Rs. 1316 per month.

You can plan your investments in advance, and view what your returns will amount to, before you invest by simply using an SDP calculator.

Avail a loan in case of a cash crunch

In case of Systematic Deposit Plan, premature withdrawals are possible along with a salient benefit. Since you have multiple deposits running parallelly, you need only break one of them to meet your liquidity needs, and can leave the rest undisturbed.

You’ll notice that the SDP offers the best of all worlds, with the convenience of SIPs and safety of fixed deposits. However, apart from allowing you to benefit from a range of regular FD features, SDP lets you start small through bite-sized deposit amounts. Save with Systematic Deposit Plan to move from being a regular saver to a super saver, and start the process right away.

2020-03-05 12:32:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/announcements/how-to-maximise-returns-with-fd-in-2020-4790261.html,"Even as the country grapples with an economic slump and shrinking GDP numbers, you as a retail investor may be deliberating over your investments, looking forward to a financially successful 2020. To meet your goals while navigating through market downturns, asset allocation is key.

This is all the more essential, when you consider that in the recent past, certain equity-linked schemes gave negative returns, even when the SIP route was employed. To strike a healthy balance, it’s wise to add to your portfolio non-risky instruments such as a fixed deposit. Deposits are favourites amongst Indian investors, providing individuals without the wherewithal to step into the market, a way to earn interest regularly.

Nonetheless, even though fixed deposits are straightforward instruments, you should go beyond simple asset allocation and look for ways to fine-tune your investment for optimal gains. To help you do so, here’s a rundown on how to maximise your returns with FD in 2020.

Choose the right issuer to reap wholesome yields

After a slew of RBI repo rate cuts, handpicking your issuer is vital, as you earn returns in direct proportion to the interest rate offered. While bank FDs are popular, you can consider an NBFC FD as interest rates tend to be more competitive on the NBFC front. Yet, and on the back of crises in this sector, it’s important to club good credentials with a healthy interest rate if you want to earn returns in a predictable manner.

Bajaj Finance FD, for instance, offers you a good blend of safety and returns. FD interest rates, here, run up to 8.35% and your returns are backed by several stability and credibility ratings. This FD carries the highest stability ratings of FAAA by CRISIL and MAAA by ICRA and Bajaj Finance prides itself as being the only Indian NBFC to own BBB- ratings by S&P Global.

Having considered the aspect of safety, take a look at how you can use this FD to grow your money.

Customer type Deposit amount (in Rs.) Tenor (in yrs.) Interest rate (in %) Interest earned (in Rs.) Maturity amount (in Rs.) Regular 20,00,000 5 8.10 9,52,286 29,52,286 Senior citizen 20,00,000 5 8.35 9,86,583 29,86,583

FDs offer interest in a variable fashion, in the sense that the rate you get depends on tenor and payout option you choose. With many issuers, FD rates peak when your tenor hits 3 years. Nonetheless, you may not want to be deprived of liquidity for so long a timeframe, especially if you are a senior citizen. Hence, you can opt for frequent payouts but when doing so, bear in mind the general rule: cumulative FDs yield better, and your net returns decrease as the payout frequency increases.

To understand, here’s a snapshot of how a senior citizen Bajaj Finance FD of Rs. 20 lakh taken for a 5-year tenor, yields at different payout frequencies.

Payout frequency Interest rate (in %) Interest earned (in Rs.) Monthly 8.05% 13,417 Quarterly 8.10% 40,500 Half yearly 8.18% 81,800 Yearly 8.35% 1,67,000

A good way to circumvent reduced interest rates for regular payouts is to employ the technique of laddering. Here, instead of investing a lump sum investment in one go, you split up your investment among several FDs in such ways, so as to obtain liquidity at regular intervals, courtesy of differing maturity dates. Creating an investment loop also helps you obtain the current FD interest rates.

While you can employ the technique with any FD, Bajaj Finance facilitates investments through Systematic Deposit Plan, enabling you to invest via small monthly amounts. With an investment starting at Rs. 5000, you can invest for 12 to 60 months. Each monthly deposit counts as a new FD and you earn regular payouts, depending on your tenor, and in a cumulative fashion.

Plan for the future and look at 2020 through the FD lens

When it comes to investments, timing is of the essence. To illustrate, consider that by investing in a 5-year tax-saver FD early, you can be prepared for the Investment Declaration period and hence gain timely tax deductions. Similarly, timing is also vital in the sense that your investment should complement your goals. When earmarking investments consider that compound interest gains increase over longer tenors. So, as you list out your short-, medium- and long-term goals, use the FD calculator to arrive at an FD structure that’s best in terms of liquidity and returns.

Nevertheless, since you may not have the means to invest in one go during the first month of the year, it’s important that you look at 2020 with an eye on FD investments. For instance, you can accumulate a sum of money till July and lock that in for a period of 3 to 5 years to finance your child’s higher education. At maturity, the amount will help you prepare for fall semester intakes in the future. Likewise, you can devote the next quarter’s surplus to another FD by side-stepping gold investments during the festive season. This allows you to build a corpus for an important goal while also protecting you against uncertain asset appreciation.

Having considered how to maximise your FD returns in 2020, start by identifying a good issuer. When you pick Bajaj Finance, you obtain a generous rate alongside convenient features such as FD Renewal and Multi-Deposit facilities. Moreover, these are available to NRIs too and NRI Fixed Deposits enjoy returns boosted by country-specific Double Tax Avoidance Agreements. That said, irrespective of whether you are an Indian resident or an NRI you can setup your FD quickly. All you need to do is book a call with an executive today.

The bull run in 2019 might go down as one of the most ""hated"" rallies as only a handful of stocks attracted the smart money.

The Indian equity market scaled new peaks in 2019 surging about 13 percent. However, the rally was primarily inspired by a few frontliners. These select heavyweights attracted a lot of attention from fund managers or boutique wealth management firms raking in big money from the ultra-rich in 2019.

About 13 stocks emerged as favourites among Portfolio Management Schemes (PMSes) as more than 10 funds included them in their portfolio, data from PMS Bazaar, an online portal used for PMS comparison, investment and analytics, showed.

These include index heavyweights such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, RIL, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finserv, and Kotak Mahindra Bank.

Experts say the smart money is going in quality stocks or the ones which are displaying growth potential.

“The market has become very narrow where most of the money moved into top-quality stocks, especially the leader of a particular sector, because despite the slowdown in the economy these top 10-15 stocks manage to continue with their strong earnings,” Amit Gupta, Co-Founder and CEO, TradingBells told Moneycontrol.

Note: The above list is for reference and not buy or sell ideas

Portfolio Management Schemes (PMSes) cater to wealthy investors with portfolio sizes exceeding Rs 50 lakh. The professional fee charged by them is slightly higher than regular mutual funds (MFs).

Other stocks that are owned by less than 10 strategies include HDFC, L&T, SBI, Avenue Supermarts, HUL, ITC, Infosys, Jubilant FoodWorks, Berger Paints, Divi’s Laboratories, among others.

The schemes which have delivered maximum returns in the last one year are from the multi-cap category. Multi-Cap category funds are more diversified and include stocks from various market-cap baskets. A typical multi-cap portfolio comprises of stocks from large-cap, midcap, and smallcap space.

IIFL Multicap PMS scheme generated maximum wealth or return for ultra-rich in the one-year period starting from November 2018-November 2019. It recorded 27.76 percent return under the 1-year category, which exceeds returns across all categories, data from PMSBazaar.com showed.

Indian equities after a sharp rally during 2013-17 have largely been in a consolidation mode over the last two calendar years, and much of the consolidation was seen in the small & midcap space.

Experts feel that 2020 could be a year when we could see a catch-up rally in many of the small & midcap names as earnings start to look better with recovery in the Indian economy, so the multi-cap category could do well in the next 12 months.

“There could be earnings and valuation upgrade going ahead as nominal growth is expected to revive from lows which should aid both top-line and bottom-line growth,” Vinay Khattar, Head, Edelweiss professional Investor Research told Moneycontrol.

“2019 was characterized by a Broad-based slowdown in the domestic economy, tight credit conditions, escalating global trade war and muted global growth. Even in such conditions, markets managed to stay afloat though small and mid-caps took a significant beating,” he said.

Khattar further added that 2020 could bring substantial gains in core sectors and undervalued mid and small-cap stocks.

Well, you will probably love these three stocks if you had invested in them say in January 2019, and probably hate them if you missed out on the opportunity.

These three stocks have been among the top return generators across three-month, six- month and YTD basis as well. Three stocks which top the charts include names like Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Finserv, and from the private banking space, ICICI Bank.

They have delivered more than 40 percent return each to investors so far in 2019, and if commentary from experts is something to go by then there is still more upside left.

Data suggests that markets are favouring “turnaround” performers such as Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Industries. However, the past month’s trend is showing the market move towards companies with lower sales growth, higher capital intensity, and higher leverage, Elara Capital said in a report.

After rallying by over 40 percent each – does it make sense to put money in ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finserv, and Bharti Airtel? Well, experts remain constructive on all the three names, but do not rule out consolidation in the near-term which could be used as an opportunity to buy.

“The momentum may continue in the stocks as it’s about buying winners and you sell the losers and these stocks are the leaders in their own space that are seeing liquidity coming and hence the premium that is attached to them reflects the same,” Lovelesh Sharma, Head of Research, Epic Research told Moneycontrol.

“The momentum in these stocks may continue as long as investors are less willing to take a risk with profit,” he said.

Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking told Moneycontrol that Bajaj Finserv and ICICI Bank are leaders and consistent performers in their respective sectors. Further, both companies have sound management and bright future growth prospects, which can deliver healthy returns to investors.

“Nonetheless, some consolidation can be expected in the near term given the stretched valuation however future outlook looks stable. Conversely, we remain cautious on Bharti Airtel due to on-going issues in the telecom sector,” he said.

Stocks which were outperformers from YTD, six-month, and three-month perspective include names like BPCL which rose 49 percent so far in 2019, Reliance Industries which had rallied 39 percent on a year-to-date basis, and Bajaj Finance which was the top Nifty50 gainer, up 54 percent in the same period.

Elara Capital in its report mentioned that they read these signs as the beginning of market broadening from the narrow set of “high quality” performers and expect the trend to continue among Nifty 50 stocks and more broadly across broader markets as well.",443,0.5438208281993866

All these details can be combined to summarise your monthly credit behaviour and usage.

Reading your credit card statement will help you identify errors in the statement, so that you can then rectify them promptly. This is just one aspect, but there are numerous reasons why you must keep a tab on your monthly credit card statements. Take a look at 4 such reasons.

To spot identity theft

Most of the time identity theft is recognisable when a fraudulent entity attempts it, as you will receive an OTP you have not initiated or a message with transaction details. However, thanks to technological developments, many frauds can go undetected. The only way you can track such transactions is via your credit card statement. So, it is always a healthy practice to go through your credit card statement to spot any transactions that don’t add up.

To catch any errors

Your credit card issuer does not compute your bill manually, but through a software. Owing to this automated system, there can be misprints or erroneous entries, especially in situations when you swiped the card and the first transaction failed, but you were billed nonetheless. You can identify such mistakes only when you check the statement. Apart from this, you can also check to see that the interest calculation is right, and no late payment penalty is added after you have made payments on time.

To keep track of your spending

Keeping an eye on your credit card statement gives you a glimpse into your monthly expenditure. By looking at all your transactions, you can understand your spending patterns and get a grip on your finances. You can curb overspending, see the overheads that you need to cut down on and ensure you stick to your budget.

To catch incorrect charges

Every credit card issuer charges you fees on special transactions, payment delays, balance transfers, partial credit card bill payment and EMI conversions in addition to levying an annual fee. However, if you are paying your credit card dues in full every billing cycle, for example, then you don’t have to pay any interest. So, understand the fees or charges and how they are calculated, and then check your credit card statement every month to see if they you are being charged correctly.

If you are looking for a reliable issuer who not only permits online credit card payments, but also offers detailed credit card statements, apply for Bajaj Finserv’s RBL Bank SuperCard. This credit card packs in a punch with cashbacks, rewards, EMI conversions, and minimal charges.

Moreover, you can use the SuperCard as an EMI card, loan card, and an ATM card as well and enjoy facilities like no-interest cash withdrawal for up to 50 days, conversion of credit card purchases into easy EMIs, and no-interest personal loan for up to 90 days.

2019-09-06 16:45:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/manage-all-your-outstanding-debt-with-a-personal-loan-for-debt-consolidation-4410651.html,"When faced with large amounts of debt that’s threatening to snowball out of control, it may make sense to consolidate all of it and tackle all of it in one go. The idea behind debt consolidation is that you pay off all outstanding dues with one loan at a lower interest rate and thereby ease the stress on your finances.

For instance, if you have one or more credit cards, a car loan, a gold loan or other financial products that form a significant outlay every month, you have the option to consolidate them with a collateral-free personal loan. Instead of different loans charged at variable rates of interest, you borrow a single loan and repay all pending dues in one go.

In doing so, not only do you keep your debt in check and avoid late payment charges, but you also bring your finances back on track by having just one manageable EMI to tackle every month.

Read on to know how an unsecured personal loan can help you consolidate your debt.

1. Get a large sanction without pledging any collateral

As an unsecured borrowing option, a personal loan allows you to consolidate your debt without having to worry about identifying a valuable asset and worrying about its status. As lenders offer higher ticket amounts – some offer loans up to Rs.25 lakh – you can be sure of availing the amount you need without the headache of pledging something of value.

2. Pay off your new debt at an economical interest rate

Pending dues often attract additional charges and hiked interest rates. When put together, these cause the annual cost of your loans to skyrocket as you go on incurring interest. Further, if paying your current debt is a problem, then the additional fees only make it tougher. By consolidating your debt with a personal loan, you get rid of penalty charges and high-interest borrowings and only need to repay your present loan, that too at a cost-effective rate.

3. Channelize your finances towards just one EMI each month

When you consolidate debt with a personal loan, you get the convenience of bringing down all your previous debt payments into a single EMI. With less payment dates to keep track of and fewer EMIs to pay, you can manage your finances better and arrange budgets so as to redirect all your financial inflow towards clearing one EMI a month, diligently.

4. Lower your EMIs by opting for a long tenor

Not only do you get the benefit of paying just one EMI, but you can reduce your monthly burden by choosing a long tenor. Lenders like Bajaj Finserv offer you tenors ranging from 12 to 60 months, thereby giving you the freedom to either be aggressive with repayment or ease the immediate strain on your finances. As a rule of thumb, it’s best to select the shortest tenor you can manage as this keeps your interest payments to a minimum. Use an EMI calculator to determine how much you can manage.

5. Make part-prepayments at minimal extra charges

Once your financial health increases and you have surplus finances at your disposal, make prepayments to reduce the overall cost of your loan. When you make a prepayment, you clear a portion of the principal before its regular due date. While this convenience may come at a fee, the financial benefits are considerable in the long run.

6. Choose a Flexi personal loan to enjoy a range of powerful features

One way to side-step prepayment charges is to avail a flexi personal loan by Bajaj Finserv. This type of personal loan works well if you need funding for a number of causes, debt consolidation included. The advantage of a Flexi loan is that you can access higher amounts, from which you can borrow as per your needs, in parts. Further, with a flexi loan, you get the facility of paying interest-only EMIs for the initial tenor. This feature reduces the monthly cost of your loan by up to 45% and lets you take back the reins of your finances one step at a time.

Finally, personal loans offer straightforward application procedures followed by speedy loan disbursals. So, if you feel that a personal loan can tip the financial scales in your favour, start the debt consolidation process right away.

Bajaj Finserv, one of the most diversified NBFCs in the country, offers easy Personal Loans for Debt Consolidation, where you are assured of a sanction large enough to tackle all your pending dues.

The Indian markets, which saw the biggest single-day drop in a month on Tuesday, witnessed a rebound on August 14 thanks to positive global cues. The S&P BSE Sensex is back above 37,000 while the Nifty50 reclaimed 11,000 levels.

In terms of sectors, the S&P BSE Metal, Telecom, and Oil & Gas index rose 1-2 per cent, while selling was seen in healthcare and power stocks.

Some of the stocks that kept investors on the edge were YES Bank, RIL, HDFC, Bajaj Finserv, and Bajaj Finance. We spoke to an analyst to get an insight into the technicals of the stocks and where are they headed in the short term:

Analyst: Romesh Tiwari, Head of Research, CapitalAim.

Yes Bank: Stock down nearly 60% in 2019

We have seen the stock witnessing a vertical fall to hit a fresh 5-year low on Tuesday. It has been making lower lows and lower highs with heavy volumes. All the technical indicators, like MACD at -6.51 and RSI at 34.24, are still suggesting sell on the stock.

However, we cannot rule out a small bounce from this oversold region (StochRSI is at 0), which may pause the slide in the stock for a while and can see it trade in a range of Rs 70 to Rs 85 in this week.

Reliance Industries Ltd: Rallies 14% so far in 2019| saw biggest single-day gain in a decade

The stock made a low of Rs 1095.3 on August 8 2019, and then bounced back sharply, especially on Tuesday with heavy volume, which is a positive sign.

With the current momentum expected to continue in the stock, it may touch Rs 1,370 levels in this week itself and Rs 1,420 in a month, with support existing at the Rs 1,245 and Rs 1,150 levels.

There are some indicators of higher volatility in the stock, and there may be some selling if it fails to trade and close above Rs 1,270.

(Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.)

HDFC: Witnessed a sharp 5% fall on Tuesday

HDFC has a strong support around the Rs 2,040-2,020 zone. If the stock breaks below this support, then there are higher chances of the stock slipping towards the Rs 1,920-1,900 levels.

The stock may bounce back towards Rs 2,215 levels, and if it sustains there, it may further move towards Rs 2,280 level.

Although technical indicators remain mixed, the stock may trade and consolidate between the levels of Rs 2,050-2,280 in the short-term.

Bajaj Finserv: Stock up nearly 10% in 2019, but could see selling at higher levels

Bajaj Finserv has shown a bounce from the level of Rs 6,600 and made a high of Rs 7,590 on August 9. Technical indicators suggest that the stock is in an overbought region and MACD (12,26) is now showing -163.460, which suggest that it may find resistance around the recent highs around Rs 7,490-7,500.

The stock may see selling at higher levels with support coming around Rs 6,900-6,930 levels.

Bajaj Finance is rangebound and may trade between Rs 3,150-3,450 in this week.

Bulls failed to hold on to the gains made last week, as bears dragged the BSE Sensex below 37,000 and the Nifty below 11,000 on August 13.

Both global and domestic factors left investors on the edge, with selling pressure at higher levels pushing benchmark indices below their crucial support levels.

The big bull of D-Street, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, in an exclusive interview to CNBC-TV18 expressed concern over the state of the market and slowdown in the economy.

The NBFC crisis, elections and fiscal situations had led to a short-term slowdown in the economy, Jhunjhunwala. He was not bearish on the market at current levels and saw 10,750-11,000 levels on the Nifty to act as the bottom.

The final tally on D-Street: the Sensex plunged 623 points to 36,958. The Nifty50 down 183 points at 10,925.

Sectorally, the Nifty Auto index was down 3.9 percent, followed by the Nifty Infrastructure index that plunged 3.6 percent, and the Nifty Financial Services slipped 2.9 percent.

Four factors that could be weighing on markets:

FM's silence on super-rich tax

Much of the last week’s gain, witnessed in the final two days, were attributed to the expectation that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman would tweak the tax structure for foreign investors, a concern that has been roiling the market.

At a meeting with foreign portfolio investors on August 9, she gave no indication of rethinking the proposal to raise their taxes, a Reuters report quoted some of the investors as saying.

A day earlier, there were reports that the government could exempt foreign investors from the super-rich tax slapped on those earning more than Rs 2 crore a year.

The tax proposed in the budget, ratified by Parliament, saw investors pull $1.8 billion out of Indian equities in July alone.

Argentina crash

Asian markets were trading lower largely on concerns over a drawn out global trade war, protests in Hong Kong and a crash in Argentina’s peso currency.

Investors were also still assessing the wider damage caused by August 12’s crash in Argentina after its President Mauricio Macri became the latest pro-free market, pro-reform leader to be given a beating at the polls by a populist rival, a Reuters report said.

“The peso collapsed 15 percent, equities crumbled 48 percent in dollar terms —the second biggest one-day slump anywhere since 1950— and the bond market crashed, with a 100-year bond that investors had recently gobbled up tumbling 20% as fears of yet another government default spiked,” added the report.

Financials lead the decline

Nifty

The Nifty Bank tumbled more than 700 points, or over 2 percent, led by fall in YES Bank (down 10%) followed by Federal Bank (down 5%), RBL Bank (down 2.9%), IndusInd Bank, and SBI , both down by over 2 percent.

The Nifty Finance slipped 3 percent led by losses in M&M Financials (down 6%), followed by Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC, and ICICI Prudential which were down by over 5 percent each.

Technical factors

The Nifty, which that reclaimed 11,100 levels for the first time since July for the week ended August 9, breached 11,000 levels. The decline was fierce as the index breached 13-day exponential moving average (EMA), as well as 5-day EMA in a single trading session.

Last week, technical indicators were suggesting a short coverings rally in Indian markets towards 11,200-11,300 levels but the fierce fall on August 13 could make analysts revise calculations.

“If we manage to surpass 11,200-11,300 levels, then the next possible resistance is placed in the zone of 11,450 – 11,500. At this juncture, the pragmatic approach would be to take one step at a time and focus more on individual stocks,” Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst, Technical & Derivatives, Angel Broking said.

“On the lower side, the immediate support is seen around 11,062–10,975 and with a broader view, as long as we are defending 10,782–10,750, there is no reason to worry for.”",658,-0.9955714344978333

Q) The most important question which everyone is asking is when will be bottom out? There are no positive surprises from the earnings, the economy is showing signs of a slowdown, and corporate governance issues keep cropping up.

A) The earnings yield in equities should support the Nifty at some point. The Nifty may even rise on the back of a handful of stocks, as has been the case for a while now.

However, given the pain pervading the broader market, the bottoming out process will take time. Sadly, many niggles have ballooned into big concerns, and new headaches have emerged in recent months.

Liquidity and credit availability issues have been a drag on the economy for a long time now, and even multiple rate cuts have not helped their cause either.

Domestic consumption, which is holding up economic growth, has hit a cyclical downturn after several years of a falling savings rate.

Revival in the private-sector investment seems remote because of credit hassles, demand issues and drop in animal spirits.

There is a perception gaining ground that following the initial success in the form of a few low-hanging fruits, the bad asset resolution process has slowed down.

The cautious commentary by a set of private banks, which were unaffected so far, hasn’t helped either. Fears of an encroaching slippage cycle in the retail consumer credit loom large.

Government capex (capital expenditure) has held up so far, but factoring in both the on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet borrowings, there seems a risk of further crowding out of the private sector.

The super-rich tax has impacted the sentiment of UHNIs (ultra-high net worth individuals) and FPIs (foreign portfolio investments). Discernibly, socialist positions calling for further job reservations in the private sector and attempts to cancel legacy government contracts in certain states also does not bode well.

Given the weak logistics activity, as reflected by the lull in freight traffic across roads, rail, shipping and even at ports, GDP growth may drop lower before it recovers.

My sense is that the market has entered a long consolidation phase following the buoyant rally that reigned from 2013-end till 2017. The year 2018 was that of a big fall, and 2019 is likely to be another year of consolidation that should last till some point in 2020. The second leg of an upswing seems likely only in FY21.

Q) What do you make of the earnings that have come so far?

A) The result season hasn’t been encouraging, so far. Revenue growth has suffered a multi-quarter dip on account of the auto sector lag, besides the strain caused by other consumption companies.

Tata Motors and Vodafone losses have been a major drag on the already slow earnings. Our sense is that it could get worse as the season progresses.

However, on the bright side, the financial sector earnings are improving notwithstanding the gloomy commentary.

Q) What do you make of the auto sales numbers for July?

A) We expect auto sales to remain weak in July 2019. While inventories have been corrected through OEM (original equipment manufacturer) production cuts, our recent channel checks hint at further deceleration in the retail demand.

In the passenger car space, given the weak inquiries, we expect double-digit declines for all listed players. The CV (commercial vehicle) segment has been hit hard by a multitude of factors: economic slowdown, lower freight rates, higher fuel prices and NBFC crisis.

Consequently, sustained weakness in retail volumes is imminent; hence we expect a 20 percent decline in industry volumes.

Q) How is August likely to pan out for investors? What are the important events to watch out?

A) Though a month-by-month market prediction is invariably difficult, we should hopefully see a semblance of a respite in August, after a largely forgettable July.

The market expects a few decisive steps from the government towards damage control. If it happens, sentiments would get a boost.

Marketmen keenly await the quarterly GDP data. Scenarios of the RBI cutting rates and helping improve credit availability are among the key hopes.

Q) In July we saw a glimpse of selling in top largecaps names, which is not a positive sign if you are a bull. Which will correct the most, the HDFC twins (HDFC Bank and HDFC Ltd) or the Bajaj twins (Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv)?

A) The Bajaj twins seem more susceptible to further correction. The HDFC twins should deliver stable operating performance in the coming quarters notwithstanding the external challenges, thanks to their relatively undemanding valuation, controlled growth in recent years, limited exposure to vulnerable consumer financing segments and access to stable and low-cost funding. Bajaj twins, too, have a robust business model but they could exhibit higher cyclicality.

Q) It looks like things are changing fast on Dalal Street. What is your advice to investors? How can they decide what stocks to keep and which ones to sell out?

A) Firstly, investors must immediately exit companies plagued with governance issues and regulatory overhang, even if at a loss.

Secondly, they should ensure a margin of safety across their portfolios. In the present scenario, anything that’s expensive on FY20 numbers is at a price risk. Even institutional investors wouldn’t want to take a chance with FY21-22 estimates in an uncertain economic scenario.

Last, but not least, the evergreen rule is to own stocks from sunrise industries, those blessed with excellent management with a growing competitive edge and an eye for disruption and innovation.

Investors shouldn’t hesitate to sell if the industry or company has sticky challenges or the competitive position is under threat.

Q) People have forgotten the word ‘multibagger’ in 2019 which was a popular word before 2018. But, given the extent of fall, this might be the right time to look at stocks that could eventually turn out to be multibaggers as the tide reverses. What are your views?

A) It’s a good sign that people aren’t looking up the keyword ‘multibagger’ on the web anymore. This trend shows that market greed has abated, and caution (read fear) has taken over.

However, it doesn’t mean that all will be hunky-dory about investing henceforth. Only after a period of consolidation, small and mid-caps will resurface to relish good times again.

Given a three to five-year time horizon, stock nibbling won’t be such a bad idea, especially if done in a staggered manner. But, since the same set of midcaps and small caps, which zoomed between 2014 to 2017, may not lead the next rally, it’s better to wait for the dust to settle in this segment.

For now, with bad news floating around and more pouring in by the day, our bias would be towards well-established names.

Even holding cash seems a great option. The problem is that I don’t know of anyone who has free cash anymore, given the hit across all asset classes: equities, property and even FMPs.

ICICI Direct's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finserv delivered a healthy performance in terms of topline across segments. However, claims related to cyclone Fani and impairment of exposure to DHFL fixed securities impacted earnings of insurance business. A distinguished business model with focus on affluent masses (consumer durables) led to continued strong in AUM. Led by strong growth in AUM at 41% YoY, commercial finance business continued to see traction with 43% YoY growth in NII at Rs 3688 crore. Provisions including w/off grew 80% YoY for Stage 3 to Rs 421 crore, leading to marginal impact on PAT to Rs 1195 crore, up 43% YoY. Asset quality marginally deteriorated with GNPA ratio at 1.60%, up 6 bps. Slippages were at Rs 702 crore vs. Rs 607 crore QoQ.

Outlook

However, based on unsustainability of high growth and anticipated asset quality pressure in commercial finance business, we revise our target price lower to Rs 7280 (earlier Rs 8500), based on SOTP valuation, implying a multiple of 22.2x on FY21E consolidated earnings. We maintain our HOLD recommendation on the stock.

""So that is a signal,"" said Bajaj.

It is not only that non-banking financial companies' liquidity crisis hurting the rural and SME lending, but the economy is also slowing down, said Bajaj in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

""The economy is slowing down any way whether it is HDFC numbers or whether our own numbers, we have lower growth and this both consumer space, consumer demand is low. This has nothing to do with the NBFCs lack of ability to lend in the last couple of quarters. That is probably further adding to it but the slowdown is quite apparent,"" said Bajaj.

The Reserve Bank of India needs to strengthen the regulation of big NBFCs, but the regulator should also give some facilities that are offered to banks, he said. If both are lending to the same consumer or corporate or SME then their loans should be treated in the same way and this is one step towards that, Bajaj added.

""I hope that the RBI takes this clue to significantly strengthen the liquidity support to these large NBFCs in the same way that it is provided to banks,"" he added.

Having a reasonable amount of margin money for a liquidity buffer for NBFCs would create confidence in the underlying entities in the market and that is what is important because it was loss of confidence and not a real NPA issue with NBFCs so far, he said.

""We, as an industry, have been talking for some time now that large NBFCs which have been playing a significant role for the economy and are today larger than most banks need to be regulated differently from the 10,000 NBFCs,"" said Bajaj.

Even the classification of systemically important NBFCs includes firms with assets over Rs 500 crore but these large NBFCs have gone way beyond that, said Bajaj, adding that the top 10 NBFCs in the country have assets over Rs 10,000 crore and the larger ones have even Rs 1 lakh crore and above.

When asked about the partial credit guarantee scheme, Bajaj said there is no stress in the NBFC sector on quality of loans because NBFCs lend for one, two, three years and they are able to borrow for that period of time.

""We have not seen big defaults in housing space, in HFCs – the only trigger has been the large defaults with IL&FS,"" he added.

""So the measures are not required so much on the solvency side, on quality of business side but the measures are clearly required on the liquidity side,"" he said, adding that the finance minister had mentioned to jump start this and so they have provided the necessary support to restart the cycle.

India’s non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are under the weather and the reasons are widely known. The default of IL&FS group companies in September last year triggered not only a funding crunch but led to a crisis of confidence. The credit event resulted in many NBFCs gasping for liquidity and has pushed up their borrowing costs. The dislocation in the financial sector isn’t the only issue.

Sharekhan's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finserv posted mixed results for Q4 FY19 with growth of 44% y-o-y in consolidated revenue driven by strong growth in its subsidiary Bajaj Finance but performance in Insurance subsidiaries was relatively weak. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance's net profit impacted due to higher underwriting losses and provisions. Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance's PAT declined on account of provision for expected losses from impairment of investments. We believe there are medium term challenges for insurance businesses, which are likely to keep upsides capped even the lending business outlook continues to be bright.

Outlook

We downgrade our rating to Hold with a revised price target (PT) of Rs. 8,250.

Consolidated revenue grew 45% YoY to Rs 11142 crore, led by healthy traction in all segments. Finance business continued healthy earnings but infra cost & provision on investment impacted earnings in insurance business. Consolidated PAT grew 16% YoY to Rs 851 crore Continued strong growth at 41% YoY in AUM led 46% YoY growth in topline. Asset quality saw marginal deterioration QoQ but was largely under control. PBT increased 53.6% YoY to Rs 1458 crore Robust premium accretion in general insurance at 35% YoY was largely led by motor segment. Combined ratio was at 94.2% vs. 92.1% in Q3FY18, 97.2% in Q2FY19. Higher cost (led by new tie-ups) and provision on investments at Rs 25 crore kept PAT at Rs 224 crore Healthy traction in NBP and renewal led to 22% YoY growth in LI premium. Increase in ticket size by ~10% and improvement in persistency supported premium growth. However, PAT remained subdued at Rs 112 crore, led by provision of Rs 66 crore on investment.

Outlook

Bajaj Finserv continued to deliver a robust performance with assertive outlook. Strong parentage and focus on productivity enabled Bajaj Finance to tide over market wide concerns on liquidity. We remain positive on the stock due to 1) continued traction in AUM with control on asset quality, 2) strong and profitable growth in GI and 3) focus on improving persistency in LI premium. Accordingly, we revise our target price to Rs 6950 (earlier Rs 6280), based on SOTP valuation, implying a multiple of 26.6x on FY20E consolidated earnings. Factoring fundamental strength, we maintain BUY.

Edited excerpt:

Do you see RBI reducing rates in 2019 or a change in its stance?

The reduction in inflation forecast to 2.7-3.2% from 3.9-4.5% should have ideally lead to lesser hawkish monetary policy. As the shift in policy stance was done in the last meeting, it was difficult for RBI to reverse the same.

If one sees continued benign data on the inflation front, one can hope for increased liquidity from RBI, going forward, to support credit growth.

We believe even if the RBI does not act, bond yield will come down if the inflation is benign as aggregate demand and supply are more relevant than RBI rate. As we have seen earlier as well that despite RBI reducing rates in 2015-17, the transmission of rates did not happen.

Do you think the pain in the mid and smallcaps is here to stay in 2019 as well?

Since small and midcaps are down 35 percent (Nifty Smallcap 50) and 13 percent (Nifty Midcap 50), respectively, so far in 2018, there could arise an opportunity where you find good quality stocks at attractive valuations in these segments but avoid averaging stocks whose fundamentals have deteriorated significantly.

We are focused on stories, which are benefiting from crude price fall. Also, we are seeing some improvement in liquidity for NBFCs which will help in a rebound in credit growth helping these companies grow.

After a muted 2018, what are your predictions for 2019?

The market has more or less disappointed investors in 2018. The Nifty50 has merely given 4 percent YTD return till date. The rising crude oil prices, depreciating rupee and international trade tensions were some factors that affected the market in 2018.

However, in 2019, because of lower crude prices many macro challenges like currency depreciation, increasing CAD and inflation are getting resolved.

2019 strategy: Top five fundamental safe stocks which are good buys at current levels for a holding period of 1 year?

We expect the following stocks to perform well in the coming year (2019):

Indian Energy Exchange (IEX): To benefit from growing volumes in the short-term electricity market.

L&T Infotech (LTI): Strong client mining and deal win momentum would lead to the sustenance of top-tier revenue and earnings growth.

Axis Bank: To benefit from robust NII growth and a decline in loan loss provisioning.

Larsen & Toubro (L&T): Improving the capex cycle and government thrust on infrastructure spending will be the key triggers.

Bajaj Finserv: To benefit from a higher share under the motor segment (general insurance), focus on customer retention, and increasing the absolute value of new business (life insurance).

Which sectors are likely to hog the limelight in the coming year?

We are positive on capital goods and IT sectors. While capital goods stocks have not participated much in the recent rally, growth momentum is likely to be decent going forward considering the impact of the upcoming elections and on the assumption that private capex will make a return.

In the IT space, improving demand in America led by a pick-up in retail and the stability in the BFSI segment will support growth. The strong demand for digital solutions is also positive for the IT sector.

Do you think rupee will continue to appreciate in the near term?

We have already seen some recovery in the rupee over the past one month, primarily on account of the decline in crude oil prices. It will depend on the future direction of crude oil prices and the trend of foreign flows.

Also, the headwinds with regard to Brexit deal and trade wars will ensure that the volatility may rise, going forward.

Any sector(s) which you think could turn out to be dark horse in 2019?

The capital goods sector could be a dark horse in 2019 due to the possible easing of pricing pressure due to the return of private capex and pick up in order execution.

What should be the ideal strategy for investors for the next one year?

At any given time, one should invest based on their risk profile. There is no hard and fast rule; an aggressive person can invest 70% in equities, 20% debt, and 10% in gold, whereas a person with a moderate risk appetite can invest 50% in equities, 35% in debt, and 15% in gold.

A conservative investor should invest 50% in debt, 20% gold, and the rest in equities. However, from a tactical allocation perspective, one can increase weight in equities with a bias toward smaller & mid-cap companies.

Hadrien Mendonca IIFL

The market staged a strong pullback in the past three trading sessions and has not only surpassed but also closed above its long-term 200-DEMA of 10,700 levels, which will now act as a strong support area.

However, it is advisable to be optimistically cautious at the current juncture. The Nifty has formed a Doji pattern on the daily chart which indicates that momentum, to some extent, is fading away.

Only a break above the 10,900 levels in futures would trigger a fresh rally which will then open the gates for 11,100 on the upside.

Bank Nifty has formed a Doji pattern indicating uncertainty is on the cards. For any kind of fresh upside, Bank Nifty has to surpass the rising channel resistance zone of 27,100 levels.

On the downside, 26,400 is an important support. It is advisable to remain stock-specific as multiple high-beta sectors like real estate and infra are back in action. While metals space could be avoided.

Here is a list of stocks that could deliver 5-13% returns in the next 1 month:

Indiabulls Real Estate: Buy| Target: Rs 89| Stop Loss: Rs 75| Returns 12.5%

The stock has been on a declining mode for the past four weeks and has finally formed a double bottom pattern on the weekly chart.

The stock has also broken out from a falling channel pattern on the daily chart accompanied with a smart uptick in traded volumes.

Apart from this on the monthly chart Indiabulls Real Estate has also respected November 2016 lows and bounced off smoothly. We expect the stock to move higher towards its potential target of Rs89 in the medium term.

Bajaj Finserv: Buy| Target: Rs 6,500| Stop Loss: Rs 5,940| Returns 5.5%

The stock has been showing immense strength in the past four trading sessions and has finally broken out from a classic cup and handle pattern on the daily chart.

It has also managed to surpass its short as well as long-term moving averages. The weekly chart analysis indicates that stock is on the verge of forming a Bullish Engulfing pattern which is a positive development.

Infosys: Buy| Target: Rs 745| Stop Loss: Rs 673| Returns 7%

The stock has been consolidating for the past nine trading sessions and has finally broken out from Flag pattern on the daily chart. The breakout has been accompanied with a smart uptick in traded volumes.

In addition, the positive crossover on the relative strength index further accentuates our bullish stance on the stock.

Well, a day of consolidation for Indian markets. But, the party still continues at least for now. The S&P SBE Sensex which reclaimed Mount 36K failed to hold on to the momentum and closed a shade below that at 35,929.

The Nifty50 which was trading above 10800 in morning trade settled at 10791, up 53 points.

On the global front, British Prime Minister Theresa May survived a no-confidence vote, and as China appeared to be taking more steps to meet US demands to open its markets we saw renewed focus on risk assets across the globe.

Barring the metal and telecom index, all other sectoral indices on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) closed the day in the green. Realty, capital goods, and consumer durable rose over 1 percent each.

Technically, 10929 will be important resistance level to watch out for. Also, as long as Nifty trades below 10800, 10749, chances of profit booking remains high.

The rupee snapped its three-day losing streak to end 33 paise higher at 71.68 against the US dollar on December 13 amid a weak greenback and softening oil prices.

On the institutional side, FPI were net buyers to the tune of Rs 675 crore in Indian markets, while DIIs were net sellers to the tune of Rs 51 crore, provisional data showed.

Big News:

Well, the much awaited RBI board meet is due later today

Newly appointed RBI governor Shaktikanta Das is expected to focus on the liquidity situation in the financial system especially NBFCs

With fall in inflation some analysts are seeing a possibility of a rate cut and even a change in stance to dovish from calibrated tightening

The board will be apprised of a recent decision taken by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Patel on the structure and the mandate of the committee to review the RBI's economic capital framework.

Technical View:

Nifty formed a bearish candle which resembles spinning top kind of formation

Most experts feel for bulls to regain control, the index has to close above its intermediate top which is placed at 10929-10,950.

If the index stays below 10800 or its 200-DMA placed at 10749, there are higher chances of index going through profit booking.

Three levels to watch: 10750, 10800, 10930-10950

Max Call OI: 11000, 10900

Max Put OI: 10,000, 10200

Technical Recommendations:

We spoke to IIFL and here’s what they have to recommend:

Indiabulls Real Estate: Buy| Target: Rs 89| Stop Loss: Rs 75| Returns 12.5%

Bajaj Finserv Ltd: Buy| Target: Rs 6500| Stop Loss: Rs 5940| Returns 5.5%

Infosys Ltd: Buy| Target: Rs 745| Stop Loss: Rs 673| Returns 7%

ICICI Direct's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finserv delivered healthy top-line performance; however, earnings were below estimate, due to insurance business impact. Consolidated revenue grew 17.3% YoY to Rs 9698 crore, primarily led by finance and GI business. Consolidated PAT was flat YoY at Rs 704 crore, due to moderate profitability insurance business Continued strong growth at 38% YoY in AUM led 40% YoY growth in topline. Asset quality continued to remain broadly stable. Exposure to IL&FS reported at ~Rs 225 crore, adequately secured against property Unfavorable pricing in Kharif season and planned lower quantum of crop insurance written led to 4.8% YoY decline in premium accretion. Claim of Rs 63 crore related to Kerala floods led to increase in combined ratio to 97.2%, resulting in underwriting loss of Rs 12 crore. LI premium growth came muted at 3% YoY. Rated individual business grew 24% YoY; group fund based business remained subdued.

Outlook

Bajaj Finserv continued to deliver robust performance with assertive outlook. Strong parentage and focus on productivity to enable Bajaj Finance tide market wide concerns on liquidity. We expect some moderation in growth momentum in businesses. Accordingly, we revise our target price to Rs 6280 (earlier Rs 7750), based on SOTP valuation, implying a multiple of 22.3x on FY20E consolidated earnings. Revision in Bajaj Finance target valuation led to downward revision of ~Rs 900 per share in Bajaj Finserv, while recent challenges in insurance segment have contributed to ~Rs 600 per share reduction. Factoring fundamental strength, we maintain BUY recommendation.

JM Financial's research report on Bajaj FinServ

Bajaj FinServ reported consolidated PAT of INR 7.0 billion, up 1% YoY as the strong performance in Bajaj Finance (IndAS PAT up 55% YoY in 2QFY19) was offset by a) Kerala flood losses at BAGIC which negatively impacted combined ratio by 360bps and b) investment related provisions and losses at BALIC which negatively impacted shareholders’ net income. A key point to note is that Bajaj FinServ continues to be a debt-free company with surplus liquidity (ex-group investments) at INR 8.4 billion as of Sep’18. All three of Bajaj FinServ’s (BJFIN) businesses are well-poised to post strong profitability going forward.

Outlook

We value BJFIN using SOTP and maintain BUY with a target price of INR 6,525.

JM Financial's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finance (BAF), the financing business and BAGIC, the general insurance, both reported strong 1QFY19 numbers while BALIC, the life insurance business could continue to witness muted APE growth owing to the high-base set last year. BAF reported 1QFY19 net profit of INR 8.35bn as per IndAS, up 81% YoY. As per IGAAP, net profit was up 69% YoY at INR 10.18bn. This strong performance was supported by robust customer acquisition and stellar asset quality. BAGIC continued to report best-in-class CORs of 90.2% in 1QFY19 vs. 95.8% last year on the back of retail-focussed product mix and strong distribution. BALIC reported muted APE growth at 3% YoY in 1QFY19 on the back of the 86% YoY growth achieved last year – we expect it to remain muted going into FY19. The product mix shifted in favour of high-margin traditional products with the share of individual PAR rising to 35% in 1QFY19 vs. 19% in 1QFY18. Moreover, the insurer continued to record improvement in persistency and productivity during the quarter.

Outlook

All three of Bajaj FinServ’s (BJFIN) businesses are well-poised to post strong profitability going forward. We value BJFIN using SOTP and maintain BUY with a target price of INR 7,210.

Edelweiss' research report on Bajaj Finserv

For Q1FY19, while Bajaj Finserv’s general insurance arm (BAGIC) posted strong performance, the lending unit Bajaj Finance (BFL) sustained momentum. For BFL, IND-AS transition marred headline numbers, but core sustained strong underlying momentum — consol. AUM surged ~35%, expenses were contained and asset quality was steady. BAGIC reported a robust quarter—combined ratio stood at 90.2% (lowest among peers) thus feeding into better underlying profitability. The life insurance unit (BALIC) extended improvement in operating metrics (persistency), but growth momentum was softer, which is a key monitorable. While we are enthused by the Q1FY19 show, we see limited upside from current levels given: 1) BFL’s steep valuation (>6x FY20E P/BV) which is pricing in growth potential; 2) BAGIC’s 25x FY20E EPS; and 3) BALIC’s valuation at 1.9x P/EV. Hence, maintain ‘HOLD’.

Outlook

We are enthused by improvement in operating variables across units. BFL is going strong with >35% asset and earnings surge. The life and general insurance units have also seen significant value discovery in past few quarters. Despite incorporating this in our target multiples for BALIC (~1.8-2.0x, despite <12% of core RoEV) and BAGIC (25x FY20E EPS) along with factoring in strong performance by BFL, the stock offers limited upside from current levels. Maintain ‘HOLD/SP’ with revised SoTP of INR6,839 (INR5,869 earlier), factoring higher valuation of BFL.

Neha DaveMoneycontrol Research

Bajaj Finance is the best performing stock in the Nifty year to date (YTD). While Nifty gave returns of 5 percent, Bajaj Finance is up by 55 percent YTD, creating a staggering alpha for the investors.

In fact, it has been one of the biggest wealth-creating stock growing 73x in last 11 years (generating CAGR or compounded annual returns of 48 percent). The stellar stock performance isn’t a surprise since the lender has an enviable track record of growing its asset book by 42 percent CAGR and profit by 62 percent CAGR over the same period.

Given the strong outperformance of the stock, the questions that arises is should investors look at the stock incrementally and can it continue to do well? In our view, yes. The stock is expensive, but for a reason. Investors cannot ignore this business of lending to the aspirational mass, which is in a sweet spot.

Quarter at a glance

Bajaj Finance

Bajaj Finance, one of the largest retail asset financing NBFCs in India, posted yet another year of solid net profit growth of 81 percent year -on-year (YoY) as per Ind AS (Indian Accounting Standards) led by robust loan book growth and controlled expenses. The loan book increased to Rs 93,314 crore, growth of 35 percent YoY. Adjusting for one-off short-term IPO financing amount outstanding in Q1 of last year, loan growth would be 39 percent YoY.

Loan growth was broad based and was contributed by almost all business segments. Rural segment constitutes 7 percent of the loan book up from 1 percent in 2015 as company has increased rural branches & franchisees to 693, which is just below its urban network of 793 branches.

Cost to income declined to 37 percent from 42 percent last year as the base year had one off cost. Also, moving of housing finance business to a separate subsidiary led to some cost savings. However, cost are expected to inch up again as the lender continues invests for growth. Asset quality improved with gross non-performing assets at 1.4 percent as compared to 1.7 percent last year. Despite providing as per expected credit loss (ECL) method prescribed in Ind AS, the increase in provisions was limited at 7 percent, indicating the NBFC was already following a conservative provisioning policy. The provision coverage on standard assets improved from 40 bps to 89 bps on transition to Ind-AS.

In Q1, the NBFC transitioned to Ind-AS. This resulted in some financial impact as adjustments were done as per norms for the prior-period. The 2 noteworthy impacts are 1) FY17 net worth declined by 6.5 percent and 2) FY18 profits was 7 percent lower under Ind-AS as compared to the reported number as per I-GAAP. While there has been restatement of profit, it is purely an accounting change. It does not alter the underlying economic value of the business or key investment thesis.

While the overall operating metric keeps getting better, we are most encouraged by the new customer acquisition of 2.07 million in this quarter, growth of 30 percent YoY. Bajaj Finance now has total franchise of 28.3 million customers.

Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finserv Limited (BFS), the holding company for the various financial services businesses under the Bajaj group also reported healthy performance. BFS participates in the financing business through its 55 percent holding in Bajaj Finance and in the insurance business through its 74 percent holding in two unlisted subsidiaries, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company (BAGIC) and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company (BALIC).

BAGIC: Sharp improvement in combined ratio

BAGIC reported robust Q1 performance with its combined ratio now lowest among the peers. Gross written premium (GWP) increased by 23 percent YoY in Q1 driven by group health which now is the second-largest segment contributing 23 percent to total premium. Motor insurance continues to be largest segment with share of 44 percent of premium while share of crop insurance fell below 2 percent. We are particularly enthused by significant fall in the combined ratio to 90.2 percent, an improvement by 560 bps YoY, leading to underwriting profit.

BALIC: Muted growth

BALIC reported subdued Q1 earnings as growth in individual APE (Annualised Premium Equivalent) was soft at 2 percent YoY. However, a growth of 36 percent in renewal premium helped overall GWP grow at 18 percent YoY. While growth was weak, operating performance improved as persistency ratio increased across all time period (13, 25 and 37 months).

Despite improving performance of insurance businesses, Bajaj Finance (BFL) with 56 percent share, continues to be a significant contributor to parent BFS’s profitability. We like the insurance franchise housed within Bajaj Finserv and see upside to Bajaj Finserv’s valuation driven mainly by lending franchise and well supported by insurance businesses. However, given the fact that holding company structure has certain inefficiencies and awaiting clarity on Allianz’s stake in insurance business, we prefer Bajaj Finance over Bajaj Finserv.

What will drive Bajaj Finance’s future earnings growth?

While there is macro headwind in form of rising interest rates and increasing competition that can compress margins, the micro business of Bajaj Finance continues to be very strong. Consumer durable financing business requires a deep feet-on-street and a considerably evolved risk assessment processes, stringent underwriting norms, agile monitoring and superior collection mechanisms. With the usage of technology, Bajaj finance has succeeded in creating all of these and build a superior franchise with significant moats.

Despite its high growth, Bajaj Finance’s loan book is only 1 percent of the outstanding credit. Hence, we see enough growth potential. For instance, Bajaj finance’s existing customer franchise of 28 million is estimated to have around Rs 5 to 6.5 trillion of outstanding mortgage loans. Bajaj’s ability to on-board them as its mortgage customers can offer immense growth opportunity. Moreover, there is significant opportunity to cross-sell products. Overall, we see earnings growth sustainable on the back of Bajaj finance’s vantage positioning and enough growth potential in the segment.

The big question for investors: Is the steep valuation justified, the high earnings growth notwithstanding?

Bajaj finance’s stock is up sharply by 29 percent since our last earnings review note in May wherein we suggested investors to buy the stock. It is currently trading at FY20e P/B ratio (price-to-book) of 6.7 which is a significant premium to many other NBFCs.

There is little room for a re-rating of the valuation multiple. But we feel the company can maintain high earnings growth trajectory in the near term which will lend support to the premium valuations. Having said that, steep valuation doesn’t leave much room for the lender to falter on growth or on asset quality.

While the rich valuations demand caution, the business’s unique moats make it a must own core holding amongst Indian NBFCs. Hence, in the current volatile phase of the market, investors should look out for any price correction opportunity to buy into the stock.

Domestic equity markets got off to a negative start to F&O expiry week, amid trade war concerns. The Nifty lost 0.6 percent to close at 10,753 on Monday.

The market breadth was in favour of declines with two share declining for every one gaining. After Friday’s rally, the market failed to show follow through action on the upside.

The index has been facing resistance at the falling resistance trend line connecting the highs of 11,172 and 10,929 levels. It faces resistance at 10,835-10,860 levels and needs to clear this hurdle which will confirm strength on the upside. On the downside, 10,700 levels is now critical support level from where buying emerged last week.

The rising support trend line connecting the lows of 9,952 and 10,418 levels comes around 10,700 levels. The triangle pattern formation emerges with the market at a critical juncture from where a break out on either side will provide direction.

A break below 10,700 levels will see resumption of the downtrend and the Nifty might retest 10,550 levels. On the upside, a rally above 10,860 levels can see the index moving rally towards 10,929 levels which is its May high.

In Nifty options, 10,800, 10,700 and 10,600 puts witnessed large amount of unwinding, while 10,800, 10,900 and 11,000 calls saw a significant amount of writing activity, suggesting upside is likely to be capped and that lowers levels may be tested.

Here is a list of top 5 stocks that could return 7-11 percent in the next 1 month:

Hindustan Unilever Limited: Buy| CMP: Rs 1,615| Stop loss: Rs 1,580| Target: Rs 1,750| Return 8%

The stock is in a long-term uptrend forming higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily and weekly charts. After the recent run-up move in the price, the stock has been consolidating its gains at all-time high levels between Rs 1,625 and Rs 1,550 odd levels for the last one month.

The 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) has been providing support on dips and the stock has been moving higher. Current bounce back has also been from the average.

The Relative strength index or the RSI has given a positive crossover with its average on the daily chart. Thus, the stock can be bought at current levels and on dips to Rs 1,605 with a stop loss below Rs 1,575 for a target of Rs 1,750 levels.

RBL Bank Limited: Buy| CMP: Rs 559| Stop loss: Rs 535| Target: Rs 620| Return 11%

The stock has been trading sideways to negative between Rs 600 to Rs 450 odd levels for more than a year now. It has formed a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern on the weekly chart and witnessed a breakout on strong momentum and high volumes couple of weeks back.

After hitting a 52-week high of Rs 570, the price has corrected on below-average volumes to test the breakout level and then bounced back. The Relative strength index has given positive crossover with its average.

Thus, the stock can be bought at current levels and on dips to Rs 552 with a stop loss below Rs 535 for a target of Rs 620 levels.

Lupin Limited: Buy| CMP: Rs 913| Stop loss: Rs 880| Target: Rs 1,000| Return 9.5%

The stock has formed a bullish falling wedge pattern on the weekly chart. At the start of the month, the stock witnessed a breakout from the pattern on strong momentum and high volumes to touch a high of Rs 925.

Since then the price has been trading in a narrow range on below-average volumes consolidating its gains. It has formed a bullish pole and flag continuation pattern on the daily chart which is typically expected to give a breakout on the upside.

The stochastic oscillator has given a positive crossover with average suggesting uptrend is likely to resume. Thus, the stock can be bought at current levels and on dips to Rs 905 with a stop loss below Rs 880 and a target of Rs 1,000 levels.

Bajaj Finserv Limited: Buy| CMP: Rs 6,165| Stop loss: Rs 6,000| Target: Rs 6,600| Return 7%

The stock has seen consolidating in a range of Rs 5,800 and Rs 4,800 odd levels over the last nine months period. The price formed rounding bottom pattern and witnessed in the month of May on strong momentum backed by high volumes.

Since the last one-month, the stock has been consolidating above its breakout levels and seen a breakout from it. The ADX line indicator of trend strength on the weekly chart has moved above neutral level of 20 indicating uptrend is likely to sustain.

Thus, the stock can be bought at current levels and on dips to Rs 6,100 with a stop loss below Rs 6,000 for a target of Rs 6,600 levels.

Motherson Sumi Systems Limited: Sell| CMP: Rs 288| Stop loss: Rs 298| Target: Rs 260| Return 9.7%

The stock has formed a bearish head and shoulders pattern on the weekly chart over the last one-year period. In Monday’s session, the price has broken below the neckline of the pattern.

It has formed a long bearish candlestick and accompanied by high volumes confirming the breakout.

The price has been trading below the long-term as well as short moving averages. MACD line has given negative crossover with its average below neutral level of zero on the daily chart.

Thus, the stock can be sold at current levels and on rise to Rs 291 with a stop loss above Rs 290 for a target of Rs 260 levels.

Edelweiss' research report on Bajaj Finserv

In Q4FY18, Bajaj Finserv’s lending business (BFL) posted a strong performance and general insurance (BAGIC) sustained momentum. BFL clocked yet another robust performance—AUM (consolidated) jumped ~40% and PAT grew >60% YoY. Qualitatively, BAGIC reported a steady quarter—combined ratio at 93.4% (lowest among peers). However, PAT missed marginally on lower investment income. Life insurance’s (BALIC) operating metrics (individual growth, persistency) continued to improve; sustainability is key. EV of INR118bn missed estimate on negative investment variance and higher cost overruns—key monitorables. While we are enthused by Q4FY18 performance, we perceive limited upside due to: 1) BFL’s steep valuations (>5x FY20E P/BV, post equity raising) pricing in near-term growth potential; 2) BAGIC’s 25x FY20E EPS valuation; and 3) BALIC’s valuation at 1.9x P/EV. Hence, maintain ‘HOLD’.

Outlook

We are enthused by improvement in operating variables across businesses. BFL is going strong with 35% plus asset and earnings surge. There has also been significant value discovery in life and general insurance businesses over the past few quarters. Despite incorporating this in our target multiples for BALIC (~1.8-2.0x, despite <10% of core RoEV) & BAGIC (25x FY20E EPS) and also factoring in strong performance at BFL, there seems to be limited upside. Hence, we maintain ‘HOLD/SP’ with SOTP-based TP of INR5,859.

Sameet Chavan

Bajaj Finserv has been enjoying a multi-year bull run for the last four years. There has been no major correction seen in this course of action, which is quite remarkable.

We can witness a series of breakouts in the ongoing bull run. More importantly, most of the breakouts are accompanied by a substantial rise in volumes, indicating strong buying interest at all-time highs as well.

We recommend buying on a minor dip towards Rs 6,000 for a near-term target of Rs 6,700. Traders can keep their stop loss below Rs 5,715.

Bajaj Finserv posted a 28 percent rise in its March quarter consolidated net profit to Rs 685.5 crore YoY on the back of a strong growth in its insurance and non-banking ventures, although it missed estimates. A Reuters poll of equity analysts had estimated that net profit could grow by 64 percent to Rs 875.5 crore for Q4FY18.

In Q4FY17, the company had posted a net profit of Rs 534.9 crore.

Bajaj Finserv is the holding company for insurance and non-banking financial company (NBFC) Bajaj Finance.

Premium and other operating income from the insurance business rose 15.5 percent YoY to Rs 5,147.9 crore. Revenue from operations rose 36.9 percent to Rs 3,681.37 crore. For Q4, the consolidated total revenue rose by 25 percent to Rs 8,829 crore.

For the full year (FY18), income from operations rose 34.4 percent to Rs 13,561.64 crore YoY. The Reuters poll had estimated income from operations to rise by 15.5 percent in FY18. The revenue from operations in FY17 was Rs 10,104.8 crore.

The company was formed in April 2007 as a result of its demerger from Bajaj Auto to further Bajaj Group’s financial services business. This demerger enabled Bajaj Finserv to independently run core businesses of lending, insurance and wealth advisory.

The board has recommended a dividend of Rs 1.75 per share. Bajaj Finserv stock was among the top two on Nifty, along with its group company Bajaj Finance on May 17.

Bajaj Finance rallied more than 7.6 percent after its March quarter profit shot 61 percent YoY with an improvement in asset quality.

Bajaj Finance

Bajaj Finance reported a 60.5 percent YoY surge in net profit at Rs 720.95 crore for the fourth quarter ending March 2018 on the back of robust interest income and lower provisions due to improvement in bad loans.

The NBFC's net profit in the same quarter last year was Rs 449 crore. Net interest income (NII) for the quarter increased to Rs 2,365 crore, up 40 percent YoY from Rs 1,686 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

Insurance businesses

Insurance subsidiaries Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance saw a healthy growth in revenues.

Bajaj Allianz General Insurance saw a 27 percent rise in net earned premium for Q4FY18, which stood at Rs 1,650 crore. Net profit rose by 13 percent YoY to Rs 187 crore for the March quarter.

The life insurance business saw a 20 percent increase in new business premium for the fourth quarter YoY to Rs 1,394 crore. Persistency (renewals) for the 13th month improved from 68 percent in FY17 to 77 percent in FY18.",444,0.9999995364083184

Equity benchmarks snapped their five-week winning streak last week and formed a small bearish candle carrying a higher high and higher low with sizeable upper shadow, indicating profit booking at higher levels. In line with our view, the Nifty maintained its rhythm of not forming more than five weekly bull candles as the current round of profit-booking emerged precisely after five week’s rally from March lows (9,952-10,785).

Going forward, we expect the Nifty to form a strong base in the broader range of 10,500–10,750 and eventually move out of the upper band of consolidation (10,750) to head towards 10,950 levels. We expect the index to continue with its base formation in the broader range of 10,750-10,500 in the near-term, with stock specific activity remaining in focus amid elevated volatility as we approach the upcoming Karnataka elections.

The ongoing secondary consolidation phase forms part of the larger degree uptrend and offers an opportunity to accumulate quality stocks in a staggered manner. Therefore, any throwbacks towards 10,500 should be used as an incremental buying opportunity in quality stocks as it is a confluence of:





38.2% retracement of the last upmove from 9,952 to 10,785 at 10,467



Last two week’s low is placed at 10,515 levels

Structurally, the overall bias remains positive as we are witnessing an improvement in the broader structure since the current upmove is the largest (833 points) in magnitude compared to the previous two pullbacks (362 and 337 points).

The broader consolidation would make markets healthy. We see gradual formation of a higher base that would set the stage for the index to head towards its extended target of 10,950, as it is:





Higher band of its rising channel placed around 10,950 levels



80% retracement of its entire major fall (11,172–9,952) placed at 10,928 levels



Bajaj Finserv: Buy: CMP: Rs 5350 | Target: Rs 6,095 | Stop loss: Rs 5,190 | Return 14%| Time frame: 6 months

The stock after registering a life high of Rs 5,790 during September 2017, has entered into a secondary corrective phase as it discounted excesses built in the previous rally and factored in concerns over rising bond yields etc.

The share price has recently resolved out of past six month’s basing pattern, signalling the end of the corrective phase and commencement of fresh up leg, thus providing fresh entry opportunity.

The price decline from a lifetime high and subsequent consolidation phase over the past six months fulfill all properties of a corrective pattern within a primary uptrend as it retraced the preceding four months’ rally just by 50 percent over seven months indicating robustness in the price structure

Significantly, the consolidation over past six months anchored at the key support of Rs 4800 as it is the confluence of:

a) 50 percent retracement of the previous up move (Rs 3801-5790)

b) The long-term rising 52 weeks EMA, which has been held since CY 2013

The stock has immediate support at Rs 5,200 as it is the 61.8 percent retracement of the most recent rally.

We expect the stock to resume uptrend after the current consolidation breakout and head towards Rs 6,100 in the medium term as it is the confluence of the breakout implication (5450-4800=650 points added to breakout of Rs 5450) and 123.6 percent external retracement of September 2017 – February 2018 decline (5790-4500) placed at Rs 6,095

Kalpataru Power: Buy | CMP: Rs 491 | Target: Rs 570 | Stop loss: Rs 448 | Return 15% | Time Frame: 6 months

The share price of Kalpataru Power has seen a stupendous, multifold rally since CY13. The stock recorded an all-time high of Rs 535 in January 2018. Since then, it has undergone a healthy corrective phase in the last 14 weeks.

It saw a base formation around the key value area of Rs 400-420. Structurally, the entire up move since November 2016 till date has occurred in a well-defined rising channel. It highlights a robust up move amid persistent demand to own the stock at elevated levels.

The stock recently witnessed a rebound from the support area and has registered a breakout above the trendline joining previous highs signalling a reversal of the secondary corrective phase and resumption of a fresh up move.

Thus, it provides a fresh entry opportunity for the medium term. Among oscillators, the weekly 14 period’s RSI is seen taking support near its previous low, thus supporting the positive bias in the stock in the medium term.

Based on the above technical observation we expect the stock to head higher towards Rs 570 in the medium term as it is the 123.6 percent external retracement of the entire previous decline (Rs 535 to Rs 400), which also coincides with the higher band of the rising channel around Rs 570.

Visaka Industries: Buy | CMP: Rs 765 | Target: Rs 875: Stop loss: Rs 720 | Return 14% | Time frame: 1 month

The share price of Visaka Industries has been trading in an upward sloping channel formation signalling strong demand at elevated levels

Over past three months, the stock found support from 200 DMA on multiple occasions, indicating buying demand near key value area of 200 DMA highlighting a structural positive bias in the stock.

While intermediate support remains at Rs 720 being the recent consolidation breakout level and the trendline support joining previous lows.

Among oscillators, MACD indicator continues to inch upward, indicating positive momentum

We believe the stock is likely to head higher in the near-term towards Rs 875 as it is the higher band of the rising channel containing the recent up move since February 2018.

The bulls managed to hold on to momentum despite muted global cues in the morning to push the Nifty index back above 10600 levels for the first time since February 5, 2018, and formed a bullish candle on the daily candlestick charts on Tuesday.

The index flirted with 10,600 levels on more than one occasion in the recent past but Tuesday’s sessions was a mark of strength from bulls. But, for the rally to gain momentum, the Nifty has to close above 10630 levels.

The Nifty took support at its 5-days exponential moving average (DEMA) placed at 10,573 and then bounced back above 10600 levels towards the close.

The Nifty which opened at 10,578 rose to an intraday high of 10,636. It slipped marginally to hit an intraday low of 10,569 in the first half of the session. The index finally closed 29 points higher at 10,614.

The way Nifty managed to climb all wall of worries and close above 10550 levels may well force bears to cover their short which could push the index higher towards the April expiry, suggest experts.

India VIX fell down by 9.47 per cent at 11.89. Overall, lower volatility is supporting the major bullish bias in the market. The Volatility is now at the lowest daily close seen in the last four months since 22nd December 2017.

According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 10,576.6, followed by 10,538.9. If the index starts moving upwards, key resistance levels to watch out are 10,644.4 and 10,674.5.

The Nifty Bank index closed at 25,042.1. The important Pivot level, which will act as crucial support for the index, is placed at 24,956.93, followed by 24,871.77. On the upside, key resistance levels are placed at 25,125.33, followed by 25,208.57.

The Nifty snapped its 9-day winning streak on Wednesday, but managed to close above its crucial support level of 10500 for the third consecutive day in a row.

The index formed a bearish candle on the daily candlestick charts after a Hanging Man pattern recorded in the previous trading session which suggests that the momentum seems to be fading.

However, the Nifty closed above its crucial 5-days exponential moving average (DEMA) which offers some hope to the bulls. However, if the index breaches 10495 in Thursday’s trading session, chances are that the trend could tilt in favour of bears.

The Nifty which opened at 10578 rose to an intraday high of 10,594 before bears walked in. The index slipped to an intraday low of 10509 before closing 22 points lower at 10,526.

According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 10,492.53, followed by 10,458.87. If the index starts moving upwards, key resistance levels to watch out are 10,577.03 and 10,627.87.

The Nifty Bank index closed at 25,102.3. The important Pivot level, which will act as crucial support for the index, is placed at 24,965.14, followed by 24,827.97.

On the upside, key resistance levels are placed at 25,333.14, followed by 25,563.97.

The Nifty50 during the previous week traded with positive bias and has maintained higher high and higher low in the weekly chart. In the process, it registered a resolute breakout above the falling channel containing the entire corrective price action since mid-February 2018 signalling a reversal of the corrective trend and resumption of the positive momentum.

The current pullback is larger in magnitude compared to the previous two pullback signalling sign of improving market structure.

We expect the index to head towards 10,480 regions which were the high of mid-March 2018. We expect focus will now shift to stock specific action as we enter into Q4 earning season; however, broader markets to extend relative outperformance while index remains in consolidation mode.

In the past two weeks, the index has rallied almost 475 points from the March low (9,952), leading the stochastic oscillator to trade in the overbought zone (currently at 90), indicating that the possibility of a breather at higher levels cannot be ruled out.

Thus, a close below Wednesday’s low of 10,355 would lead to pause in an ongoing uptrend. This may lead the index to enter a consolidation phase to cool off overbought conditions.

However, overall bias in the index remains positive hence, any breather towards 10,200 should be used as an incremental buying opportunity.

Bajaj Finserv: BUY | CMP: Rs 5420| Target: Rs 6095| Stop loss: Rs 5190 | Return: 12%| Time frame: 6 months

Bajaj Finserv after registering life high of Rs 5790 during September 2017, has entered a secondary corrective phase as it discounted excesses built in the previous rally and factored in concerns over rising bond yields etc.

In the current week, the share price resolved out of past six month’s basing pattern, signalling the end of the corrective phase and commencement of fresh up leg, thus providing fresh entry opportunity.

The price decline from a lifetime high and subsequent consolidation phase over the past six months fulfill all properties of a corrective pattern within a primary uptrend as it retraced the preceding four-month rally just by 50 percent over seven months indicating robustness in the price structure

Significantly, the consolidation over past six months anchored at the key support of Rs 4800 as it is the confluence of:

a) 50 percent retracement of the previous up move (Rs 3801-5790)

b) The long-term rising 52 weeks EMA, which has been held since CY 2013

The stock has immediate support at Rs 5200 as it is the 61.8 percent retracement of the most recent rally.

We expect the stock to resume uptrend after the current consolidation breakout and head towards Rs 6100 in the medium term as it is the confluence of the breakout implication (Rs 5450-4800= Rs 650 points added to breakout of Rs 5450) and 123.6 percent external retracement of September 2017 – February 2018 decline (Rs 5790-4500) placed at Rs 6095.

The Finance Minister introduced a long-term capital gains tax of 10 percent if the gains exceed Rs 100,000 without allowing the benefit of indexation.

However, all gains till January 31, 2018 will be grandfathered and short term capital gains remains unchanged at 15 percent.

The Nifty was down 80 points or 0.71 percent on Friday morning and was trading below the 11K mark at 10,938 while the Sensex fell 256 points and was trading at 35,650. The fall in the benchmark indices was aided by midcaps, the Bank Nifty and the Infra space.

But the sectors which traded in the green included the IT space led by stocks like Info Edge, TCS, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra. The CNX Pharma index gained over 1 percent led by stocks like Sun Pharma, Lupin, Glenmark Pharma, Dr Reddy's Labs and Aurobindo Pharma.

IT from the FMCG space jumped 2.4 percent. Edelweiss Financial has maintained a hold on ITC with a target price of Rs 313 as Budget 2018 left the tax structure for cigarettes unchanged which was much softer than our anticipation, it said.

The house expects the stock to re-rate due to improving prospects.

Morgan Stanley has maintained an overweight rating on ITC with target of Rs 320 as there was no change in cigarette tax. It is of the view that the next trigger is volume growth and outcome of GST Council meeting. The research firm expects very low probability of introduction of additional GST tax slab for cigarettes.

The top Nifty gainers included ITC which jumped over 2 percent followed by Dr Reddy's Labs, Sun Pharma, Lupin and HCL Tech. The most active stock apart from ITC was State Bank of India which was down 1 percent while Ashok Leyland, TCS and Reliance Industries were the other active stocks.

The top Nifty losers included names like Indiabulls Housing Finance which fell over 3 percent followed by HDFC, ONGC, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank, each shedding 2 percent each.

The top Sensex gainers were Info Edge, ITC, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, Bajaj Finserv and Fortis Healthcare. The top losers included PC Jeweller which tanked 15 percent followed by Vakrangee which was down 10 percent. Cummins India and eClerx were the other top losers.

Baaj Auto from the Nifty was one of the few stocks which hit fresh 52-week high. The stocks which hit new 52-week low included names like Allahabad Bank, Cummins India, LIC Housing Finance and MCX India.

The market breadth was in favour of the declines on Friday morning with 222 stocks advancing while 1383 stocks declined and 409 stocks remained unchanged. On the BSE, 348 stocks advanced while 1766 stocks declined and 64 remained unchanged.

Edelweiss' research report on Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finserv’s Q2FY18 was marked by robust performance in general insurance (BAGIC) and sustained momentum in lending business (BFL). The latter clocked yet another strong performance—AUM jumped ~38% and PAT grew >36% YoY (marginally below estimate on higher opex as it continued to invest for growth). It was a strong quarter for BAGIC as well—combined ratio at 88.8% (lowest among peers) and PAT up > 20% QoQ. Life insurance’s (BALIC) operating metrics continued to improve—better individual growth, persistency—though sustainability is key. While we are enthused by business performance, 1) BFL’s steep valuations (>5.5x FY19E P/BV post equity raising) pricing in near-term growth potential; 2) general insurance’s 25x FY19E EPS valuation and; 3) life insurance’s embedded value at 1.9x, indicate limited upside. Maintain ‘HOLD’.

Outlook

We are enthused by improvement in operating variables across businesses. BFL is going strong with 35% plus asset and earnings surge. There has also been significant value discovery in life and general insurance businesses over past couple of quarters. Incorporating this in our target multiples for BALIC & BAGIC and also factoring in strong performance & capital raising at BFL, we revise our SOTP-based TP to INR5,337 (INR4,892 earlier). However, recent stock outperformance limits upside; hence, we maintain ‘HOLD/SP’.

ICICI Direct's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Consolidated revenue grew a robust 28% YoY to Rs 7561 crore led by a strong surge in GI and LI premium income. Consolidated net profit growth was 13.3% YoY to Rs 655 crore but flat QoQ, as this is a slower quarter for Bajaj Finance • Strong growth continued in finance AUM growing 38% YoY while topline grew 33% YoY to Rs 3102 crore, supporting consolidated PBT • General insurance premium growth remained healthy at 37% YoY to Rs 2857 crore, above our estimate, led by higher crop insurance. However, PBT remained flat YoY to Rs 385 crore, Combined ratio remained the highlight, improving to 88.8% vs 95.8% in Q1FY18. This has led to strong underwriting profit of Rs 138 crore • Gross life insurance premium growth improved to 39% YoY to Rs 2016 crore, was much higher than our estimate. New business premium growth remained healthy at 59% YoY to Rs 1271 crore, led by 32% YoY increase in individual rated business.

Outlook

We stay positive on the stock due to 1) sustained healthy performance of Bajaj Finance 2) strong growth in general insurance business & 3) gradual traction in individual new business premium. We maintain our target price upwards at Rs 6000/share, based on SOTP valuation, implying a multiple of 18.9x on FY20E consolidated earnings. Consequently, we maintain BUY rating. Dividend from the insurance business can be an upside risk.

KR Choksey's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Bajaj Finserv recorded a PAT of Rs. 6,551 mn, up 21.9% yoy and 22.5% qoq. The strong growth in PAT has come on back of superior performance of the lending arm (Bajaj Finance Ltd.) and general insurance (Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Ltd. /BAGIC) which recorded yoy PAT growth of 42% and 62% respectively. For the life insurance arm (Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company/BALIC), GWP was up 15% yoy Aat Rs. 11,536 mn which was lower than the total insurance business growth of 16.3%. While the management is confident about the performance of the lending business to continue, general insurance business of Bajaj Finserv is likely to stay one of the most efficient and profitable ones (combined ratio - 95.8% for Q1FY18 versus 101.2% for Q1FY17 and 96.8% for FY17). The company is also confident of transforming the life insurance business by focusing more on retail premium, diversifying distribution channel and restructuring product-mix balance, along with improving persistency and productivity.

Outlook

Strong outlook on the lending business as well as the insurance business should translate into strong earnings for the consolidated entity, ultimately resulting in high return ratios. Further, stake sales in the insurance arms could provide further unlocking for the consolidated entity. We recommend ACCUMULATE on the stock and expect an upside of 5.3% from current levels. We have value the stock on SOTP valuations, arriving at a target price of Rs. 5,215.

The Nifty extended its corrective decline on Wednesday ahead of May series derivative expiry as selling pressure in Cement, Pharma and PSU banking stocks weighed.

The index has been in a corrective phase over the few sessions as it reacted from a life high of 9,532 as profit booking set in after four weeks of gains and momentum oscillators approached overbought conditions.

However, the five sessions corrective decline in Nifty along with a healthy correction to the tune of average 20 percent in the recent run up in mid cap and small cap stocks have helped markets to work out of overbought conditions.

In the entire up move since December 2016, intermediate corrections have not lasted for more than five to six trading sessions. With five sessions of correction behind us, we expect the current decline to get arrested over the next couple of sessions.

Price wise, the Nifty has not corrected more than 200 points in any of the instances since December 2016 lows. As Nifty has already corrected 190 points from recent peak (9,532) and time wise correction approaches maturity along with healthy price correction in broader markets, we believe further decline towards 9,300 presents an incremental buying opportunity for a pull back towards 9550 levels.

The immediate support base for the index is placed at 9,300 regions being the 50% retracement of current up move (9,075 to 9,532) and the higher low formed in early May 2017

Here is a list of top 4 stocks which can give up to 21% return in the next six months:

Larsen & Toubro: BUY| Target Rs2035| Stop Loss Rs1,540| Upside 20%| Time Frame 6 months

The share price has been in a healthy sideways consolidation over the past four weeks marking an intermediate breather after a decent run up during March – April 2017.

A shallow price correction over past few weeks represents a pennant formation on the weekly time interval chart. A pennant formation is a bullish continuation pattern marking a breather after the strong rally and provides fresh entry opportunity.

Earlier, the stock has signalled a bullish structural turnaround after registering breakout from a healthy corrective phase of two years between 2015 and 2016.

The steady up move since the start of CY2017 has seen the stock post a faster retracement of the July-December 2016 fall (Rs1,615 to Rs1,302) as the five-month decline was completely overhauled in less than four months.

Faster retracement of the major down move and formation of higher high and higher low on the monthly/quarterly scale indicates conclusion of the two-year corrective phase and resumption of the primary uptrend.

JK Tyre & Industries: BUY| Target Rs198| Stop Loss Rs146| Upside 21%| Time Frame 6 months

The corrective decline over past few sessions has led the JK tyres share price to its support level around Rs160 as it is the breakout level above its 2014 and 2016 price peaks.

We expect the key historical resistance to reverse its role as support amid ongoing healthy corrective decline and therefore offers fresh entry opportunity.

Structurally, the share price of JK Tyre remains in a secular uptrend forming rising peaks and troughs on the long term charts. Within the structural uptrend, the stock has witnessed periodic secondary corrections that have provided fresh entry opportunities.

Recent developments on the price front suggest that the stock has concluded an elongated corrective phase in the last two years as it broke out of Bullish Cup and Handle formation during April 2017. Stock looks poised to embark upon its next major up move thereby providing a fresh entry opportunity to medium term investors

Maruti Suzuki: BUY| Target Rs7750| Stop Loss Rs6520| Upside 13% | Time Frame 6 months

The share price of Maruti has been a strong outperformer in the auto space as it strides northward in a rising peaks and troughs manner on the long term chart amid continued investor participation at elevated levels

The entire up move since March 2016 has occurred in a well-defined rising channel highlighting a structured up move. The sharp up move from November 2016 lows (Rs4765 placed at the lower band of rising trend channel) saw the stock forming a fresh all- time high of Rs6,233 during February 2017.

The sideways consolidation during March and April 2017 resulted in the stock once again validating the lower band of the rising channel placed at Rs5929 and helped the stock to work out off overbought conditions.

The stock has recently resumed its fresh up move and registered a fresh all-time high of Rs6,979 during the previous week’s trade. We believe the stock is attractively poised after the recent consolidation and provides a fresh entry opportunity with a favourable reward/risk setup to ride the next up move.

Bajaj Finserv: BUY| Target Rs4580| Stop Loss Rs3,780| Upside 15%| Time Frame 3 months

The share price of Bajaj Finserv has been in an intermediate corrective phase over past four weeks after hitting its life high of Rs4750 levels.

The decline of 20 percent has brought the share price towards lower band of the rising trend channel which encompasses price action since October 2016 till date.

The share price has approached its key support zone around Rs3750 levels as it is the confluence of following technical parameters

At Rs3800, current price decline has achieved equality with its November – December 2016 decline - 50% retracement of January – April 2017 rally is placed at Rs3650 levels

The sharp decline over past four weeks has led the stochastic oscillator to oversold condition with the current reading of 14. We believe the share price will attract buying support near value area in coming sessions.

Edelweiss' research report on Bajaj Finserv

While Bajaj Finserv’s Q4FY17 operating performance was on track, the recent price outperformance leading to full valuations limits the return potential. Thus, we downgrade to ‘HOLD/SP’. Bajaj Finance (BFL) reported a off-track performance given higher credit costs, though core operational parameters were steady.

Outlook

General insurance clocked strong operating performance (RoE potential of 23% plus), but implicit valuation is higher than some deals in this space. Factoring in these, we see limited upside. Hence, we downgrade to ‘HOLD/SP’ from ‘BUY/SP’ with SoTP of INR 4,093.

Bajaj Finance, the lending and investment arm of Bajaj Finserv, has lowered the minimum cap for fixed deposits to Rs 25,000 to attract retail investors.

The company will offer an annual cumulative interest rate of 8.05 per cent for a tenor of 36-60 months on the reduced amount, Bajaj Finance said in a statement.

Earlier, for depositors in the National Capital Region and Greater Mumbai, the minimum deposit amount was Rs 75,000 and for rest of India was Rs 50,000, it said.

The new minimum cap of Rs 25,000 will be applicable across the country with immediate effect, it added.

This will also address the saving needs of mass retail category that are looking for assured returns with a credible savings instrument, it said.

This will also allow small depositors to generate higher returns through traditional savings product, it said.",150,0.9972715973854065

The last 12 months for Indian market were nothing short of a roller coaster ride for investors. The Nifty which gave 18 percent return in the financial year 2017 hit a low of 7,900 in December but then bounced back sharply to hit its fresh record high of 9,218.40 in March.

It was a difficult year for traders but for investors, it gave multiple entry points which they could have used to accumulate quality stocks for long-term. For the most part of the year, the market moved in a range ahead of crucial global as well as domestic events.

Indian market managed to withstand global volatility emanating from events such as Brexit, a rate hike by US Federal Reserve and surprise win of Donald Trump in US Presidential elections back in the month of November 2016.

Back home demonetisation, muted quarterly earnings growth from India Inc., Rexit, geopolitical tensions which emerged after India’s surgical strike on PoK, political uncertainty ahead of state elections etc. all weighed on sentiments.

Although investors made money in India market if they would have held on to their long positions but there are lessons to be learned:

Market always give you entry points, don't ignore:

This is one of the difficult questions in front of investors and advisors as to when to enter. Well, there is no specific month for that or even a season, investors have to remain patient and sit on cash and just wait.

When things look grim for markets and there is fear instead of euphoria there is your entry point. Why are entry points important? Well, simple explanation to that is – if you buy at a low price there is a higher chance of you making money in that trade.

One such entry point came back in the month of December when Nifty50 made a low of 7,894 or nearly 7,900 but then went in just one direction i.e. higher.

“What started as a pullback in December 2016 from the low of 7,894, has strengthened with a prudent general budget, impressive corporate earnings and followed with an enormous victory by BJP in state elections,” Amar Ambani, HoR at IIFL Private Wealth said. In just first three months of 2017, Nifty has recorded returns of 12 per cent.

Don't look back, looking ahead is important:

You may not be able to recover what you lost in FY17 in markets. But, it is important to realise the possibility which FY18 presents you. Don't remain stuck with stocks which you have already invested in, build your portfolio by adding quality stocks.

Do you know more than 100 stocks in the S&P BSE Smallcap index more than doubled your wealth in the last 12 months which includes names like Tata Metaliks, Aptech, Escorts, GNFC, Lumax Industries, ITI, Manappuram Finance, Edelweiss Financial, Gulf Oil, Delta Corp etc. among others.

In the midcap space, six stocks rose more than 100 per cent in the last 12 months which include names like Indian Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Biocon, Sun TV, JSPL, and HPCL.

The idea is not to look at the short-term market movement but be more forward looking when we are making decisions related to investments.

“Market discounted all the negative news and rose higher. The effect of falling interest rates, US Elections, Brexit, Demonetisation were discounted under the long-term positives of India growth story and delivered upside returns of 18 per cent in the financial year gone by,” Dinesh Rohira, Founder CEO of 5nance told Moneycontrol.com.

“Though it is tough to think beyond a short-term, the past year has shown that regardless of some pulling down factors, markets can and will go higher,” he said.

Focus on quality and not on quantity:

We always come face to face with situations when we feel stuck. This happens when investors get stuck with stocks which are not that liquid.

Why is liquidity important? Liquidity is your way out from any stock. It means that whenever you want to cash out there are enough buyer which want to buy that stock. One big lesson for investors at any stage is to focus on stocks which have enough liquidity.

Equities remain one of the attractive destinations with better growth outlook than its major competing asset classes such as fixed income, real estate, gold etc.

“We recommend investing in quality names that have reasonable growth visibility coupled with strong balance sheets. We advise a staggered buying approach to build a long-term portfolio,” Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research, ICICI Securities told Moneycontrol.com.

You forgot to diversify:

I am sure you know this by now that diversification is very important not just in equities but across sectors and asset classes. If we closely look at the way the past 12 months have gone by, we note that it was cyclic in terms of rallies in sectors like automobiles, telecom, pharma and banking at different time frames.

“The idea is to diversify across sectors. If you did not have an exposure to some sectors, the year could have turned out to be bad. The year was a complete turn-off for gold and real estate, the assets that has the maximum wealth of the nation,” said Rohira of 5nance.

“With the interest rates for fixed income instruments floored to sub 7 per cent investors should look forward to diversify in other avenues like debt funds that ensure stability of returns and an element of safety. A diversified and balanced portfolio is a key to building wealth on a long term,” he said.

Govt policies take time to give returns, be patient:

After gaining majority win in the state elections, the ruling government is in a much better position to implement reforms and bring out policies which can fuel the growth rate in Asia’s third-largest economy.

FY18 will see the fruits of important reforms undertaken by the government in FY17 such as demonetisation and goods and services tax (GST) which are likely to benefit small and midcap stocks more than largecaps.

Investors should learn that scope of the policies which are being implemented by the government and make their own assessment as to which sector or stock (s) will benefit directly from the implementation of such policies in future.

Instead of waiting for policies to get implemented there is no harm being prompt in your approach and buy stocks which will be available at attractive valuations.

“Fundamentals and structural changes will attract investors sooner than later. Demonetisation is a case in the point where the long-term benefit was clearly visible to smart investors while the noise in the market was crying over short term pains,” Vijay Singhania, Founder-Director, Trade Smart Online told Moneycontrol.com.",1118,0.42004644870758057

Midcap stocks never fail to surprise you. They give exponential returns when you least expect them to even perform. But, that’s how bull markets are structured. The rally in midcap stocks is far from over, but investors should try and stick to quality.

As much as 85 stocks are trading above their 5-year average price and out of that 15 stocks more than doubled from their average price recorded in the last five years, according to data compiled by Moneycontrol.com team.

Most of the stocks which have doubled from their average price of last five years include quality franchises like Bajaj Finserv, HPCL, MRF, Ajanta Pharma, Havells India, Berger Paints, TVS Motor, Biocon, UPL, Rajesh Exports, Biocon, Petronet LNG etc. among others.

If we closely analyse the data, stock which falls under the above category are from various sectors and the rally could be seen as broad-based which is a good sign and include top companies from their respective sectors.

The rally which looks more like euphoria on the Street because earnings might not have played a catch-up could extend further. Hence, investors should think twice before taking profits off the table, suggest experts.

“In solid bull markets, more and more stocks will move above their historical valuation benchmarks. The nature of the bull market is to drive stocks towards excesses. Investors should not sell hurriedly just because the prices have moved above the historical benchmark average valuations, they still can go much higher,” Jimeet Modi, CEO, SAMCO Securities told Moneycontrol.com.

“The best of returns stocks have given are when they were valued way above the benchmarks. For example -- stocks like Microsoft IBM etc. had given their best returns when they were valued at 60 P/E and above. If anybody would have sold the stock considering high valuations, they would have missed the fasted opportunity to make big money,” he said.

In a robust bull market, what works is growth investing and valuation multiple expansions. Investors should hunt for stocks which can deliver growth on a consistent basis. The valuation looks stretched for most of the midcap names but the rally has more legs.

On a trailing basis, currently the BSE midcap index is trading at 35x PE and Sensex is trading at 21x PE, which is higher compared to the historical average.

“We expect that the mid-cap stocks would outperform the index. Investors should invest only in quality midcap stocks, which have high growth potential,” Amarjeet Maurya, Senior Equity Research Analyst, Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.com.

“Most of the companies have been enjoying strong financial track record with substantial brands. They have a leadership position in their business segments and has high ROE,” he said.

Investors should understand that quality may not always come cheap. Hence, dips are best used to get into quality stocks. Companies that are growing their top and bottom lines rapidly above industry average shall command huge valuation multiples, they offer rapid capital appreciation. However, if the growth slows down, the market is equally ruthless to butcher the stock, suggest experts.

“Most of the stocks in the top 15 list they are still good for holding in the portfolios for aggressive investors. Stocks like Bajaj Finserve, TVS Motors, Biocon, Ajanta Pharma, Rajesh Exports etc. fall under growth investing category, their growth is likely to continue further and therefore the stocks to glide still higher,” said Modi.

“At the same time stocks like HPCL, MRF, Tata Communication etc fall under valuation multiple expansion stories, the same is happening because of consistency and strong visibility in their earnings,” he said.",603,0.8078294233842329

Tech Mahindra

Bank of America Merrill Lynch says acquisition of US-based CJS Group provides Tech Mahindra with an entry in the healthcare vertical. Business exposure of CJS is mainly to clients in US & UK.

Acquisition transaction is likely to be mildly earnings accretive and deal valuation at USD 110 million appears to be in-line with industry trend, the brokerage house feels.

Tech Mahindra is likely to use existing cash for CJS' acquisition. BoAML sees a contingent mull of USD 130.5 million based on 2017-19 revenue and EBITDA targets.

The brokerage house has maintained underperform rating on sensitivity w.r.t H-1B visa program in the US. Every 10 percent increase in H-1B wages may hurt earnings by 11 percent, on gross basis, BoAML feels.

However, Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on the stock as it finds CJS acquisition attractive on reasonable valuations.

CJS' large US-employee base should provide company with better employee mix, it believes. Based on current revenue & margin, Credit Suisse believes acquisition to be earnings-neutral.

Bharat Financial

Kotak Institutional Equities cautioned the street of higher-than-expected stress in Bharat Financial's portfolio. It has retained reduce call with a target price of Rs 730.

While maintaining neutral rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 720, Credit Suisse says there has been no sharp recovery in collections and over 4.4 percent portfolio remained overdue for more than two months.

It feels, shortfall in collections in off-book remains significant.

Bajaj Finserv

Goldman Sachs has revised its target upwards on Bajaj Finserv to Rs 3,220 from Rs 2,960 as it incorporated updated valuation. Demonetisation impact faded but earnings headwinds remain, it feels.

The brokerage house is continued to apply a 10 percent conglomerate discount on the company. Securing major bancassurance partner and better-than-expected margin are key risks.

ACC

CLSA says it has reiterated sell call on ACC as company's internal & external pressures impacted 2016 performance and lack of growth focus drove market share losses again.

It believes new unit in East India should help volumes in the medium-term. CLSA still see company as a key beneficiary in an upcycle.

Potential merger with Ambuja Cements could help drive synergy benefits, it feels.

Tata Power

Goldman Sachs has retained neutral rating on Tata Power as it factored in the Welspun acquisition in estimates.

The research firm has increased target price to Rs 81 from Rs 79, though FY17-19 topline estimates declined by 12-19 percent & profit by 3-12 percent.

Axis Bank

Goldman Sachs has maintained sell rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 398 on weak fundamentals in the near-medium term.

The stock is trading at 2.6x book adjusted for 70 percent provision coverage, it says.

Kotak Mahindra Bank

Goldman Sachs has a buy rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank, with a target price at Rs 925.

Jindal Steel

Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on the stock, with increased target price at Rs 150 from Rs 110. It feels operational recovery will continue as volumes ramped up.

Higher steel prices/coal output resulted in 3-7 percent higher EBITDA. Any favourable outcome of the pending cases could be an added plus, Credit Suisse feels.

Media

Nomura says it feels new tariff order by TRAI for broadcast & cable services is positive for media industry. According to the brokerage house, cost per pay channel is likely to go up, especially for MSOs (multiple system operators).

It says there is no clarity over how TRAI’s order will be implemented in analogue areas. Uniform pricing formula favours DTH & broadcasters, but may be negative for MSOs, it feels.

Nomura believes large broadcasters such as Zee Entertainment will be less affected on strong demand. Operators such as Dish TV may benefit from higher carriage costs and better ARPUs, it feels.

Digitisation & better monetisation will be key medium-term drivers, Nomura says.",648,0.14488498653684342

Financial services company Bajaj Finserv reported a 41 percent jump in its consolidated net profit at Rs 614 crore profit in the quarter ended December as against Rs 437 crore in the same period last year.

Gross revenue grew 27 percent to Rs 6,834 crore from Rs 5,396 crore in the year-ago period.

It's non-banking finance arm, Bajaj Finance, reported a 36 percent jump in its profit after tax at Rs 556 crore in the quarter from Rs 408 crore last year same period.

Consumer loans grew 47 percent to Rs 26,997 crore from Rs 18,382 crore.

SME book grew 10 percent to Rs 21,079 crore from Rs 19,146 crore.

Gross NPA and net NPA of the company stood at 1.47 percent and 0.39 percent, respectively.

Jain said the company did not opt for 90-day relaxation extended by RBI for recognition of loan accounts as NPA after the Government's move to demonetise high value old currency notes.

The market seems to have bottomed out with most of the stocks correcting between 25-30 percent, said SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com adding that the market has factored in bad news of Q3 and Q4.Tulsian further said that broking stocks have not seen improvement in volume despite stocks moving up. Below is the verbatim transcript of SP Tulsian's interview to Prashant Nair and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.Sonia: Any idea why these brokerage/NBFCs stocks are surging and do you like to own any of these names?A: We have all been talking about all these negatives on these negatives on the NBFCs for a while and if you really want to give any fundamental reason for all this brokerage stocks to up, I don’t find any fundamental reason number one.Number two if you see all this brokerage stocks, three stocks which you have mentioned or maybe 4 or 5 if I can add there maybeEdelweiss, Motilal Oswal and IIFL Holdings -- they are now not the pure brokerage company if you see the total income to the profit after tax (PAT) I don’t think that brokerage must be contributing even 5 percent of the PAT to the bottom line of these companies.It is difficult to say that the things have really started improving. We have been seeing the fate of the market for last one and a half month whether we are able to take a right call on the industry NBFC, tyre stocks, automobiles stocks that a different case, but in case of the broking industry definitely for the last 1-1.5 months we have not seen any volume picking up in spite of that the stocks are moving up. I will only draw one conclusion that couple of hours up move can quickly change the sentiments on a sector or maybe on the market that is what is happening now in the case of broking stocks.If you see Edelweiss, I can understand Edelweiss Financial have been going up for last couple of days, today is a third day in continuation the stock has moved up by 10 percent. Can you give me any one valid reason -- naturally if it is going up you have to say or you have to substantiate some positives to that stock itself.Now see the same thing having spread to the other broking stocks as well, we have talked JM Financial, IIFL Holding, Motilal Oswal -- so my point is that this is what we have discussed in the morning or this is what I have been saying, I am not taking a positive view on the market in the near term, but what can be concluded or what can be inferred that market seems to have bottomed out -- now it just needs a positive trigger which may come in the form of the pre-budget rally, expectations from the budget.Suppose take the case of the negatives of this demonetisations, we have all understood and we all only defer on the time horizon whether it can go beyond Q4 or not. We have seen the extreme pessimist also who have given a GDP projection as low as half percent for Q4, but if you take a call that what all can change the sentiments with the budget expectations and ultimately having delivered in the budget that can change the sentiments to a great extent.So yes, markets seems to have bottomed out on all fronts -- you can subdivide the market into various segments, but I won’t be taking a negative call going from here on, because all the stocks having corrected by about 25-30 percent have more than factored in the negatives what are going to be seen in Q3 as well as in Q4.Prashant: Any thoughts on Bajaj Finserv I don’t know if you track it, it is trading at Rs 2,686 right now not very much happening today, right sector, low penetration sector, great brand franchise etc. It did well till the last few weeks, any thoughts on it?A: You have to go by the movement or maybe the price behaviour of Bajaj Finance. I agree that last weeks we have seen one day the stock moving up by about 4 percent, because Bajaj Finserv being the promoter and the holding company of Bajaj Finance and we all know the fate of the NBFCs and Bajaj Finance has taken a big hit and I have been maintaining my extreme positive view on Bajaj Finance, because if you want to derive the value of Bajaj Finserv you need to take a call on Bajaj Finance, because which has a very growing business and all that and the management have confirmed that the growth of 25 percent will be seen for next 2-3 years and except for the insurance business if you knock off, which has already been seeing moving in a stagnant manner for the Bajaj Finserv, because that was not the driving force whatever accretion or increase in the share price, which we have seen in Bajaj Finserv in this last one year has happened because of the share price increase in the Bajaj Finance.I won’t be taking standalone or isolation call on its standalone business of the insurance of Bajaj Finance, where I am keeping my neutral stance, but yes because it being the holding company of the Bajaj Finance we need to take a view once the Bajaj Finance starts moving up, you will see the upsurge again coming back in Bajaj Finserv as well.Prashant: We discussed this with you earlier, very quickly does Reliance Communication business continues to struggle, but there is a big valuation difference any upside here?A: R-Com now is monetising all its assets, in fact this is what I have expressed earlier also about couple of hours back and if you see they are in the process of monetising the business, even if you go by their verdict firstly the debt is not Rs 42,000 crore it is about Rs 46,000-47,000 crore and I have not included the deferred payments to be made to the government and all that -- even if I take this Rs 31,000 crore coming in, they need to liquidate their debt of about Rs 14,000 crore, because again there is confusion of this Rs 20,000 crore which is getting transferred to Aircel JV calling as a debt repayment while it remains exactly with the company to the extent of Rs 20,000 crore -- so if you want to liquidate the debt of Rs 16,000 crore and you don’t have that much matching assets with you -- I don’t think there is any point in taking a call on R-Com because R-Com from here on will not remain a functional company, they will be having a very lease business which will not be too much income yielding or profit yielding to the company thereafter.Prashant: Any thought on this import duty 6 percent compared to 10 percent earlier and one would thought that the government doesn’t like gold very much?A: That may give a sentimental boost to the jewellery stocks, but I don’t think that looking because on one hand if you are talking of the fall in the spending and we are so circumspect on the essentials, where the spending is getting postponed, so why to talk of the gold and all kind of spending -- so yes that will be seen mild positive for the jewellery stocks and this can happen because eventually people are talking that the import duty on the gold will go away because of the lower demand seen for the gold, because if you see the gold was heavily earlier bought by in number two or maybe out of books and that has gone away -- so maybe to keep some at least momentum in the gold market, we may see the gold import duty eventually going away as well.Prashant: Just a quick word on Bharti Infratel, Rs 336 on the price it is down another nearly 3 percent today?A: I have never kept positive view on this stock, because firstly if you see -- take the view in the last 6 months they started with the share buyback by slashing the huge dividend number one. Number two they are looking to monetise the stake of the promoter that is Bharti Airtel -- that is again seen as a big hangover and with the R-Com dealing having taken place at Rs 25 lakh per tower obviously market will be reducing the valuation of Bharti Infratel also which is a significant player in the tower space.Ekta: Have you had a look at this Pritish Nandy stock, it is gaining after that they struck their deal with Amazon. Have you had time to go through that?A: I have gone through, but I am not convinced with the deal, because this kind of deal we have seen if you take the history of last 10 years of the company, you never had any kind of significant what you called financials having seen from the company -- so I am not convinced with the order flow which we have seen couple of days back.If you recall maybe 2 days back the stock was in the 20 percent upper circuit and yesterday it was down, so I am not taking a positive view on the stock going forward.Prashant: Havells India have you taken a look, Rs 322 is where Havells is trading at?A: I like the stock now having corrected from Rs 400 plus. The stock has reached to its reasonable valuation and looking to the huge cash now lying with the company of about Rs 1,500 crore one has to see that what kind of move is initiated by the promoters next. Maybe they are waiting for this demonetisation to get over, have the feel of the market. Definitely they are looking for inorganic growth. Without resorting to much debt keeping the debt free status of the company I think that the current",1669,0.0

Moneycontrol Bureau

Here are brokerage calls on top stocks for today.

Sun Pharma

Macquarie says Sun Pharma remains its preferred large-cap pharma pick, as it considers it best positioned to make the speciality transition which is essential for long-term growth.

Along with the recently launched AGs for Benicar and Benicar HCT, which have limited competition, the ramp-up of speciality launches like Bromsite (launch imminent), Xelpros and Elepsia in the next few quarters should lend support to growth in absence of one-time opportunities, it feels.

The brokerage house has an outperform rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,020.

Petronet LNG

Credit Suisse expects strong 22 percent EPS CAGR over FY17-19, and has maintained its outperform rating on Petronet LNG with a target price of Rs 750 per share.

It updated its models for higher volumes (6 percent increase in FY17 throughput at Dahej) and robust Q2FY17 numbers; FY17 EPS increased 4 percent, it says.

The brokerage house expects the LNG terminal utilisations to improve from around 7 percent currently to around 15 percent once BPCL's refinery fully ramps up (Q4FY17), helping lower Kochi losses.

Ambuja Cements

Following a sharp 30 percent correction in the last three months, the Ambuja Cements stock is at an interesting level, says Deutsche Bank.

It further says while it is still not cheap on earnings based multiples, i.e., CY17E P/E of 33x or EV/EBITDA of 15x, the second largest cement player in India is available at an EV/tonne of USD 112 – a good 25 percent below the replacement cost.

Additionally, Ambuja Cements has net cash on its books, and its parent LafargeHolcim recently bought more stakes in the company as well as its subsidiary ACC.

Bajaj Finserv

Nomura says the recent correction in Bajaj Finserv has brought valuations closer to fair levels. Moreover, both parts of the insurance business are picking up with life business growing from a weak base and crop insurance aiding growth for general insurance.

The brokerage house has retained neutral rating with a target price of Rs 3,200 per share.

Nomura says consumer discretionary disbursements had dropped by 30-35 percent in the first few days of demonetisation but are down 20 percent now and will likely normalise over next one to two months. Overall management reiterated its 20-25 percent growth target and expansion in margins will help offset the higher credit cost impact.

Fortis Healthcare

With improving efficiencies in FEHI, FMRI and SRL, Fortis Healthcare looks well poised to deliver profitable growth, says Macquarie.

The brokerage house thinks current levels provide a very attractive entry opportunity with a 12-month view on the name. It believes a demerger and separate listing of SRL will help unlock significant value for Fortis shareholders.

Macquarie has maintained an outperform rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 275 per share.

Steel

Credit Suisse has an overweight rating on Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Jindal Steel with a target of Rs 515, Rs 2,000 and Rs 110, respectively. It is underperform on SAIL with a target of Rs 35 per share.

Utilities

Credit Suisse has retained outperform rating on central utilities on low risk model with visible growth & attractive valuations. It prefers Power Grid over NTPC, given higher near-term return on equities. It has set a target for NTPC at Rs 180 and Rs 225 for Power Grid.",569,0.8740325825554984

KR Choksey's research report on Bajaj Finserv

Thanks to the healthy general insurance business trajectory and lending business continued strength, Bajaj Finserv recorded PAT at INR 5.8 bn (tad above our estimates). However, life insurance segment stood sluggish; that said, the operating metrics have stood strong. While the Management maintains cautious stance on consumer durable finance growth, the life insurance segment is set to witness growth trends over the second half of the fiscal. Therefore, while the lending continues to provide huge impetus to the group earnings, the niche general insurance business stands as the most efficient and profitable player. Besides, the life insurance is all set to barge into the strong positive growth territory capitalizing on its market share gains.

We reckon that the risky business growth momentum led by the staunch lending franchise, reorientation of business model in life business and business sustainability in general business should put up a strong consolidated earnings CAGR of 26% translating into healthy RoEs of almost 19% by FY18E. Thus, we recommend BUY rating on the stock and expect an upside potential of 16%+ from current levels. We value the stock on SOTP valuations arriving at a target price of INR 3,700 (post holding company discount of 20%). At CMP, the stock trades at 3.0x P/E FY18E. While the stock momentum has been strong, we assign ACCUMULATE rating to the stock.

Himadri Buch MoneycontrolICICI Prudential Value Discovery Fund--launched by ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund in 2004--figures among top performing diversified funds over three-year, five-year and ten-year timeframes.The scheme is ranked no.1 in the diversified equity category by CRISIL for the quarter ended June 2016. This scheme follows a value-investing style and is in fact one of the oldest value-styled funds in the industry. The objective of the scheme is to provide long-term capital growth by investing primarily in a well-diversified portfolio of companies accumulated at a discount to their fair value. The fund adopts a Warren Buffett style of value investing: it doesn't hunt for deep-value stocks but for stocks with growth potential trading at a discount.Fund manager Mrinal Singh, who is also the Deputy CIO, Equity at the fund house, attributes the outperformance to the fund's discipline in strictly adhering to value style of investment. Its strong bottom-up strategy along with a flexicap approach has also aided the fund's performance, Singh added.This fund is best suited for investors seeking long-term wealth creation. This would work well for investors with long-term goals like child’s education, child’s marriage, planning for retirement or home purchase.Detailed below is a snapshot of features, portfolio analysis, and performance of ICICI Prudential Value Discovery Fund:PERFORMANCE

On November 2, net asset value of the scheme was Rs 124.0 per unit. Portfolio Analysis In October, the scheme's assets under management stood at Rs 14,979 crore, up 3.6 percent over September. Going by the factsheet, as of October-end, the scheme had invested 92 percent of its corpus in equities and remaining was in debt. Last month, around 76 percent of the portfolio was invested in large cap companies, and mid-caps had 22 percent weightage in the portfolio while the rest were deployed in smallcaps. The portfolio consisted of 48 stocks. The top pick of the scheme was HDFC Bank with 7.94 percent of AUM deployed in the scrip followed by Wipro and Larsen & Toubro with 6.88 percent and 6.57 percent, weightage in the portfolio, respectively. ICICI Bank and Infosys with 5.96 percent and 5.75 percent share in the portfolio, respectively, were other two among the top five stocks. The fund’s portfolio was largely skewed towards the financial sector with the fund having almost 22 percent of its assets deployed in the financial services sector last month. This bet could boost its performance if the economy shows signs of picking up as financial services is the best play in economic recovery. The second quarter GDP at 7.1 percent was below market expectations and so far indications are that the full year GDP growth will be flat. Banking was followed by technology with 16 percent and pharmaceuticals with 8.6 percent. Investors have become a bit cautious on the pharmaceutical sector because the sector as a whole is now looking expensive. The fund manager made the least allocation to consumer durables (0.71 percent), FMCG (0.92 percent), and metals (1.26 percent). The fund also had exposure to energy, automobile, construction, and engineering, among others. In terms of sectors, the scheme augmented its holding in automobiles, auto ancillaries, and consumer durables. Auto is an indicator of economic recovery as well as pay hikes for government employees. The scheme increased its holding in Wipro, Larsen & Toubro, Infosys, last month. The scheme decreased its holding in Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, among the top 10 holdings. In October, the exposure remained unchanged in HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, NTPC, Maruti Suzuki India, Bajaj Finserv and Container Corp.SCHEME FEATURES Options: Growth dividend;Minimum investment: Rs 1,000;Entry load: NilExit load: 1 percent for exit within one-year from the date of allotment and no load if exited after one-yearPerformance benchmark: S&P BSE 500 Index;Fund manager: Mrinal Singh (Since Feb-2011)",626,0.0

ICICI Direct's research report on Bajaj Finserv



Bajaj Finserv is a financial conglomerate that is engaged in life insurance, general insurance, consumer finance and other financial products. The company has 74% stake in two insurance companies viz. Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company (BALIC) and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company (BAGIC) and 57.6% stake in Bajaj Finance. Led by strong growth in advances, the finance business reported consistent earnings growth. In the insurance business, general insurance has been the most profitable and efficient player in industry. However, BALIC’s growth has been relatively slower owing to regulatory overhang related to Ulip. Now, it offers huge potential with guidelines in place and recent high valuation of life insurance peers at more than 3x of their embedded value.

Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions. As per past agreed terms, Allianz had a Call option to increase its stake in insurance businesses at pre-agreed price until April 2016. However, RBI’s ruling in 2010 and subsequent directive by insurance regulator mandating all stake transactions in Indian insurance industry to be carried out at a fair value or prevailing market value led to uncertainty on ownership. Allianz can now either increase its stake in the insurance business at fair value (much higher than pre-agreed price) or divest its holding in insurance business, both of which offer upside accretion for shareholders.

Be prepared. India is likely to see positive confidence shock with consumer discretionary and retail financiers to be benefitting the most. According to Abhay Laijawala of Deutsche Bank Multiple 7th Pay Commission, good monsoon, low interest rates and easing liquidity should provide a significant boost to aggregate demand in second half of FY17.

Not only that, festive season festive season (Sep-Nov) induced buying coninciding with pay commission awards and a likely record harvest for kharif season are likely to further ring iin more consumption.

Central government employees will begin receiving higher salaries for August 2016 - together with accumulated arrears - payable early September 2016 under seventh central pay commission (7CPC). As per Deutsche Bank's estimates 1000 crore Central government employees and pensioners stand to cumulatively receive an incremental Rs 38960 crore at the end of the current month – including arrears.However, the house warns that the market may still be underestimating the degree of the combined impact of all the above-mentioned factors occurring simultaneously, as consumers are likely to embark on a consumption overdrive.

It states that consumer discretionary and retail financiers stand out as the key first order beneficiaries of a jump in disposable income as consumers satiate their demand for discretionary consumption items such as white goods, electronics, 2-wheelers and other high priced consumption products.

""From a systemic perspective, we see injection of 7th Pay Commission payments as a boost to domestic liquidity, which should be beneficial for banking system as a whole. As bond yields/ wholesale rates will likely move lower –ceteris paribus- predominantly wholesale funded NBFCs should also benefit. As the overall wallet of the urban consumer grows, our consumer analyst believes that benefits would also accrue to high-priced/premium consumption items as well,"" it says in a note.

Potential stock beneficiaries include Bajaj Finserv, GSK Consumer, Hero Motocorp, LIC Housing Finance, Titan and Whirlpool India.",322,0.5850372314453125

E-commerce major Flipkart, after facilitating loans worth Rs 125 crore for sellers on its platform in last one year, is looking to help merchants avail credit facility of over Rs 75 crore in the next few months.

The Bengaluru-based firm, which has partnered eight financial institutions including Axis Bank, Bajaj Finserv, NeoGrowth, Lendingkart and Capital First to offer collateral-free loans to sellers on its platform, has already disbursed Rs 125 crore worth of loans in the last one year.

Under the 'Flipkart Growth Capital' programme, launched in July last year, Flipkart sellers can avail loans with interest rates starting at 11.40 percent, Flipkart said in a statement.

The programme had received over 3,000 applications in the initial months of the launch and over 800 loans have been disbursed, it added.

Mobile, electronics, fashion and fashion accessories are few categories that witnessed highest adoption for the programme, it said.

""Unavailability of finance is one of the major barriers for the growth of small businesses in both online and offline space. The programme addresses that issue and facilitates our sellers by helping them connect with trusted lenders in the industry,"" Flipkart Head Marketplace Anil Goteti said.

Considering the increasing demand for the initiative, Flipkart estimates the number to hit the Rs 200 crore-mark by the end of this festive season.

""We are also planning to launch promotional offers with our lenders for the festive season in the following two months. This will enable our sellers to grow their business and provide quality products to millions of customers shopping on the platform,"" he said.

The applications for loans were received from across the country including Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Jaipur, Surat, Meerut, Tirupur, Erode and Salem.",292,0.9761106818914413

Bajaj Finserv, a financial conglomerate under the flagship brand of Bajaj, is a diversified group spanning across lending and insurance business.

Under the stewardship of Sanjeev Bajaj, while the lending continues to provide huge impetus to the group earnings, the niche general insurance business stands as the most efficient and profitable player. Besides, the life insurance is all set to barge into the strong positive growth territory capitalizing on its market share gains. RECOMMEND BUY.

We reckon that the risky business growth momentum led by the staunch lending franchise, reorientation of business model in life business and business sustainability in general business should put up a strong consolidated earnings CAGR of 26% translating into healthy RoEs of almost 19% by FY18E. Thus, we recommend BUY rating on the stock and expect an upside potential of 16%+ from current levels. We value the stock on SOTP valuations arriving at a target price of INR 3,064 (post holding company discount of 20%). At CMP, the stock trades at 15.6x P/E FY18E.

Edelweiss' research report on Bajaj Finserv



Bajaj Finserv’s Q1FY17 (consolidated) PAT at INR5.4bn surpassed our estimate primarily riding Bajaj Finance’s (BFL) strong performance. Green shoots were reflected in improvement in individual growth, persistency; however, sustainability needs to be monitored in Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance (BALIC). General insurance (BAGIC) reported soft earnings following rise in combined ratio. We anticipate BALIC to stabilise on improving operating performance in life insurance (regulatory overhang settling, favourable macros) and management efforts. Maintain ‘BUY’.

BFL’s performance has been the key value driver, while valuation at 24.5x P/E seems relatively high. However, given strong growth in consumer credit, diversified product mix and technology leverage (higher cross selling), we expect strong EPS growth and RoE to sustain multiples. With low asset quality risks, the key driver will be earnings sustainability and thus P/E valuation methodology appears apt. We have valued BFL at 28x FY18E P/E. We have used appraisal value for BALIC with implied P/EV at 1.4x (for 10-12% RoEV) and BAGIC is valued at 3.6x FY18E P/BV for 20-25% RoE (assuming 74% stake). Hence, our revised SoTP is INR3,428 (INR2,459 earlier). Maintain ‘BUY/SP’.

Bajaj Finserv today reported a 15 percent growth in its consolidated net profit at Rs 538 crore for the first quarter ended June 30.

Consolidated income from operations of Bajaj Finserv rose 32 per cent to Rs 2,912 crore.

Bajaj Finserv is the holding company for Bajaj Group's NBFC arm Bajaj Finance, and two insurance arms - Bajaj Allianz Life and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance.

Bajaj Finance earlier in the day reported a healthy 54 per cent jump in net income at Rs 424 crore, which is its best ever numbers, in the first quarter ended June 30.

The overall numbers were whittled down by the lower profit reported by Bajaj Allianz General Insurance at Rs 132 crore, down from Rs 147 crore a year ago as the company saw a surge in its claim ratio in the reporting period, which stood at 72.4 per cent, up from 68.3 per cent in the same quarter last financial year.

Moreover, the company saw an underwriting loss of Rs 28 crore as against a profit of Rs 28 crore in the year-ago period.

""It (the low profit) was due to the fact that a couple of business lines witnessed a surge in the claim ratio during the period which included group health and motor insurance,"" Bajaj Finserv Chief Financial Officer S Sreenivasan told PTI over phone from Pune, where the Group is headquartered.

The claim ratio in group health insurance mounted to 97.5 per cent from 92 per cent a year ago, he said.

Bajaj Allianz Life reported a flat growth in net profit at Rs 244 crore as against Rs 241 crore a year ago. Its gross written premium was marginally down to Rs 1,004 crore from Rs 1,082 crore.

Commenting on this, Sreenivasan said, ""the first quarter is always a sort of lean period in the life insurance industry. But growth has started looking up and we are now focusing on individual business."" Bajaj Allianz Life's solvency ratio currently stands at 817 per cent against the minimum regulatory requirement of 150 per cent. Similarly, its total investments increased by 6 per cent to Rs 45,729 crore, up from Rs 43,269 crore in the year-ago period.

In spite of the not-so-good-numbers, the Bajaj Finserv counter rallied almost 5 per cent to close at Rs 2,727.45 on the BSE, whose benchmark shed 0.42 per cent on profit-booking after a good rally yesterday.",410,0.45310258865356445

Bajaj Finserv today said it is in initial discussions with its German joint venture partner Allianz in life and general insurance businesses on 'various options'.

Stock exchange BSE had sought clarification from the firm regarding media reports that Bajaj Finserv may buy Allianz's stakes in Bajaj Allianz Life.

Bajaj Finserv is the financial services unit of Bajaj Holdings and Investments. It has 74 percent stake each in both the ventures.

""After the recent amendment to the Insurance Act, increasing the limit for foreign investment in insurance companies, initial discussion between Bajaj and Allianz are on, on various options,"" Bajaj Finserv said in a BSE filing.

""No formal conclusion/agreement has been reached as on date and hence there is nothing to be reported at this stage,"" it added further.

Queries sent to Bajaj Finserv did not elicit any response.

Chaitanya Gudipatymoneycontrol.comIf the fortnight gone by is any indication, two big-ticket deals can mark the beginning of consolidation in the country’s insurance sector. What started as the sector's maiden buyout with Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC)-promoted HDFC Ergo general insurance company agreeing to acquire L&T General Insurance for Rs 551 crore on June 3 seems to be paving way for further mergers in the insurance segment.On June 17, the board of three companies — HDFC Standard Life, Max Life and Max Life Insurance — agreed to a merger of their businesses, and announced that they will be conducting due dilligence before they create a separate insurance entity.

The deal is set to make HDFC Life the country’s largest private insurance company by individual premium market share. Max Life is expected to be merged with Max Financial Services (MFS) following which MFS will be merged with HDFC Life. The combined entity will be called HDFC Life which, according to industry estimates, could be valued at Rs 50,000 crore.

Deepak Parekh, Chairman of HDFC, told CNBC-TV18 that he expects the combined business to be more accretive in terms of profit. Since Max Financial Services is a listed company, Parekh said HDFC will have to give Max a premium for their distribution and quality products. Distributors of insurance products — HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and Yes Bank — will contribute more to the combined entity's growth, he said.

Similarly, reports have emerged about a potential buyout of Allianz SE's stake by Bajaj Finserv in two joint ventures — Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. Industry experts peg the deal at Rs 10,000 crore with total valuation of life and general insurance business expected to be around Rs 40-45,000 crore.

Declining to comment on the reports, Sanjiv Bajaj, Managing Director of Bajaj Finserv, told CNBC-TV18 that there is an immense potential for consolidation in the country’s insurance sector. Going ahead, Bajaj Finserv will continue to grow organically and is waiting patiently to build on its life insurance business, Bajaj said.

Both Parekh and Bajaj expect the insurance industry to clock a 10-12 percent growth in FY17.",365,0.2552494804064433

Bajaj Finserv shares touched record high of Rs 2,245.30, up 8 percent intraday Monday after a media report indicated that the company is likely to buy out German partner's stake in its insurance units.

""Bajaj Finserv is likely to buy out its German partner Allianz SE's stakes in two insurance units — Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance — in a deal estimated at as much as Rs 10,000 crore,"" a media report said quoting three people familiar with the development.

Bajaj Finserv, the financial services arm of Bajaj Holdings and Investments, owns 74 percent and Allianz SE holds 26 percent in both the ventures.

""Allianz has been in discussions with Bajaj to increase its stake in the two insurance firms to 49 percent after the government raised the foreign investment limit in Indian insurers to 49 percent from 26 percent in March 2015. The discussions failed to yield any result since the two parties could not agree on the price,"" the report says.

Edelweiss's research report on Bajaj Finserv



Bajaj Finserv’s Q4FY16 PAT (consolidated) at INR 5.2bn surpassed our estimate primarily riding Bajaj General Insurance’s (BAGIC) healthy performance. Though the life insurance business (Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance (BALIC)) showed some signs of improvement (growth and persistency), sustainability needs monitoring. Bajaj Finance (BFL) reported softer earnings following slower revenue momentum and higher provisions. We anticipate BALIC to stabilise on improving operating performance in the life insurance space (regulatory overhang settling, financial savings at decadal lows).

Moneycontrol Bureau

Investors in BSE Midcap index pocketed big gains in Prime Minister Narendra Modi tenure so far. The BSE Midcap outperformed Sensex and Nifty in the two-year period from May 16, 2014. The index surged by a whopping 44 percent in two years. Though BSE midcap index gave only 5 percent returns between May 18, 2015 (May 16 was a Saturday) to May 16, 2016, the index jumped 37 percent between 2014-2015. Results of general elections were declared on May 16 (2014), when BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won with a majority to form the new government.

As per analysis, 17 stocks in the BSE Midcap index zoomed over 100 percent in two years.

Now, hold your breath, out of the total, four stocks gave returns of 200-340 percent. Bajaj Finance gained 339 percent, Ashok Leyland was up 285 percent, Britannia Industries surged 240 percent and 3M India zoomed 239 percent in the period. Other stocks which gained over 100 percent include HPCL, Marico, Berger Paints, Emami, Indiabulls Housing, Piramal Enterprise and Torrent Pharma.

Kaustubh Belapurkar, Director - Manager Research, Morningstar India, said in an interview to CNBC-TV18 that good mid and small cap funds can deliver returns much more than peers. According to him, midcaps are real growth engine to an investor's portfolio depending on the risk profile.

""Midcaps have delivered significant returns over the last three-five years compared to largecap funds but you have to be wary that they are more volatile. So you clearly need to have a long-term horizon in terms of investing in some of these funds. So, I will say even 5-7 years might be a short time because you can have cycles in the market where midcaps might underperform and since they have run up so much, you have to be a little cautious when entering this segment.""

However, even in the gaining BSE Midcap index there 20 stocks which fell in the two years. Falling around 5-90 percent, these stocks did not perform well in Modi sarkar two-year tenure so far. Among the losers are Jaiprakash Associates (down 90 percent), Jindal Steel (down 77 percent), Oriental Bank of Commerce (73 percent) and Reliance Communication (down 60 percent).

Composition

Surprisingly, all bank stocks (except YES Bank) in the BSE Midcap index lost 20-73 percent in two years. YES Bank gained 80 percent.

In contrast, among finance stocks in BSE Midcap index, except for Reliance Capital (down 11 percent), all stocks have made some healthy gains. Besides Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv and Indiabulls Housing, other gains in the space are Bajaj Holding and LIC Housing (up 45 percent and 49 percent respectively).

Similarly, all pharma and FMCG stocks gave positive returns in two years.

Macquarie says that focus on ease of doing business, Make in India, roads and railway Infrastructure and GST are steps in the right direction. ""However, fallout is that near-term growth has been tepid, as businesses repair their stretched balance sheets, adjust to new ways of doing business, such as auction of resources, and await improvement in demand,"" it says in a note.

In the one year-period, from May 16, 2014 the Sensex gained 15 percent while the Nifty climbed 16 percent. However, the indices fell off the cliff soon as Modi's magic began to dwindle after a year BJP formed government with Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister. From May 18, 2015 to May 16, 2016 the market gave negative returns to investors. In that one-year period, Sensex lost 7 percent while Nifty fell 6 percent. From May 16, 2014 to May 16, 2016 the Sensex jumped 6 percent while the Nifty gained 9 percent at closing.

The event was organized to showcase AskmeFin, an initiative aimed at addressing the finance requirements of SMEs by offering them a suite of financing options.

ICICIDirect's reserach report on Bajaj FinservThe insurance sector in India has gathered steam post FDI being raised from 26% to 49%. Stake sales by domestic insurers to their foreign partners and new investors have surged at rich valuations for both life as well as the general insurance business. Recently, HDFC Ergo General Insurance divested a 23% stake in its general insurance business at valuations of 24x FY17E PAT or 35x trailing PAT (4.9x trailing P/BV). Even deals in life insurance have happened at 2.4x to 3x forward embedded value (EV) e.g. Reliance Life divested at 3x EV and HDFC Life at 2.4x EV. In light of this, we have the scope to upgrade both Bajaj’s general and life insurance valuations as we valued them at lower valuations. We revise our target upward to | 2308 vs. | 2155 earlier. Based on SoTP valuation, we revise upwards our target price to | 2308/share (earlier | 2155) for Bajaj Finserv, which implies a multiple of 14.4x on FY17E consolidated earnings. We have upgraded both life and general insurance valuations in the wake of recent deals in the sector. The stock is available at reasonable P/E valuation of 12.2x FY17E earnings even post conservative forward estimates on life and general insurance while dividend from them can be an upside risk.

ICICIdirect.com's research report on Bajaj FinservBajaj Finserv, a financial conglomerate under the flagship brand of Bajaj and leadership of Sanjeev Bajaj has witnessed a sharp surge in earnings in all three key business segments. In general insurance, it is the most profitable and efficient player among competitors. Bajaj Finance, a niche consumer durable lender, reported a 4x increase in loan book in FY11-15 and earnings surged at 38% CAGR. BALIC enjoys a market share of ~6.8%. We expect consolidated revenue, PAT to grow at a CAGR of 12.9%, 22.9% to Rs 22996 crore, Rs 2551 crore, respectively over FY15-17E. Given Bajaj’s strong leadership in the domestic market and presence in growing business verticals, we expect the entity to continue its focus on improvement in earnings growth and sustenance of a healthy balance sheet. Both insurance companies are yet to pay dividend. In case of payouts, consolidated profits can see further upside not factored in estimates. The same can improve the return ratios further for the consolidated entity. Going ahead, we expect consolidated revenue and PAT to grow at a CAGR of 12.9% and 22.9% to Rs 22996 crore and Rs 2551 crore, respectively, over FY15-17E. Based on SoTP valuation, we ascribe a target of Rs 2155 per share for Bajaj Finserv, which implies a multiple of 13.4x on FY17E consolidated earnings. The stock is available at reasonable P/E valuation of 11.5x FY17E earnings even post conservative forward estimates on life and general insurance and dividend from them can be an upside risk.

Sanjiv Bajaj, managing director, Bajaj Finserv, says Q2 was flat for the company's general insurance business.

The company's net profit came in at Rs 441.1 crore versus a profit of Rs 316 crore. (YoY)Sonia: Can you just take us through the performance this quarter and which are the segments that have done well? A: As you just mentioned our consolidated Profits after Tax (PAT) is up 40 percent to Rs 441 crore. Now Bajaj Finance continues to deliver very strong results. We have seen total income go up 37 percent to Rs 1,701 crore while PAT for Bajaj Finance went up 42 percent to Rs 279 crore. This is their highest ever PAT. So, record results from Bajaj Finance. The life insurance company has seen a lower top line. Our Gross written premium (GWP) fell from Rs 1,401 to 1,172 crore but shareholders PAT has more than doubled from Rs 103 crore to Rs 216 crore. Now of this roughly Rs 60 crore or so is the transfer of profit from policyholders to shareholders account which we used to do till last year only end of the year. This year as we have been saying from first quarter we are doing it every quarter. So, even if you adjust for that we have a growth in the bottom line for the life insurance company. The general insurance company has seen a rather flat quarter. Our gross premiums were up just two percent to Rs 1,500 crore whereas PAT was marginally down from Rs 145 crore to Rs 141 crore. The main reason for this because if you have seen the general insurance business has consistently grown at 10-12 percent quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) but in the second quarter this year a large part of the agricultural insurance business was taken away through very aggressive pricing by government insurance companies. So, we wrote roughly about Rs 130 crore of lower agricultural insurance Q2 on Q2 and as a result we lost out on the reinsurance commission there. So, if I were to compare for example our claims ratio in Q2 it is actually lower than the previous year. It is at 72.9 percent versus 75.3 but the combined ratio is higher. So, we have lost out over there. Once again of course as we said these would still be the best numbers in the industry but compared to how the general insurance is performing earlier the performance was not great in this quarter too. So, effectively it is Bajaj Finance and the life insurance companies profits which have helped us on a consolidated basis take profits up by 40 percent. Anuj: So, for Bajaj Finance your gross NPA has stabilised after last quarter spike, but going forward do you think it can go back to the lower levels that used to exist two or three quarters back? A: When I compare whether from Q2 of this year where from 55 bps it has come down to 46 bps or even from Q2 of last year it has come down from 48 bps it has come down to 46 bps. There is as we can see a marginal decline. We also have done some accelerated provisioning in this quarter. So, if it weren\\'t for that this 46 bps would have been an even lower number. So, yes, it looks right now that this number could further go down a little bit but as we have always said it depends on the mix of business we write between our high return by the relatively riskier consumer loans and the SME and commercial loans which are lower in return relatively but also lower risk. So, it would really depend on the mix of these quarter-on-quarter.Sonia: Before I run out of time, I wanted to ask you about the fact that Insurance Regulatory & Development Authority (IRDA) has issued the final guidelines on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in insurance firms, what has the reaction of your own foreign partner been?A: The guidelines we issued some time back and since then as of yesterday IRDA has issued a clarification guideline on what control means and that is what a lot of foreign players naturally were concerned about. They wanted clarity. This of course applies not only if you are bringing in additional money to take your stake up but it also applies for existing companies even if they make no change, so it was important to get this clarity because if you go and talk to different people, you get different answers but since it is on paper now, I think it makes it very clear as we know the requirement of Indian ownership and control is in the act itself so IRDA has only clarified that and explained what it would mean and I think the clarification is very clear, it is very fair and in line with the act. This will make matters, my sense is, much easier to resolve, whether it is for our own partner or for any other joint venture (JV) as well.Sonia: Sure there is clarity now but some share holder agreements had given the foreign investor a veto power on many policy decisions even though their holding was restricted to 26 percent, but this has now been completely done away with. Will that in any way be viewed as a negative?A: To those foreign partners who had such rights, naturally they have lost those rights, but the point is they have not lost those rights after the IRDA clarification; they have lost those rights when the act got passed. There are benefits that they have gained as well, for example they have gained the right to go up to 49 percent. So, there are pros and cons but what is important is that there is clarity over it and based on that, partners have to decide. So for the power that you want and if somebody wants to be in India, they have no choice but to follow those guidelines, that is very clear.",1013,0.0

BALIC enjoys a market share of ~6.8% in new business premium.It consolidated after making peak profit of Rs 1311 crore in FY12. Going ahead, we expect consolidated revenue, PAT to grow at CAGR of 13%, 22% to Rs 22977 crore and Rs 2532 crore, respectively, in FY15-17E platforms.The corrective decline in Bajaj Finserv after hitting a life high Rs 2160 in early August 2015 is seen as a health phenomenon within a secular uptrend as the share price worked off the highly overstretched conditions developedafter the stupendous rise of over 300% from the 2014 low of Rs 634 levels to the life high of Rs 2160 in August 2015.The stock is currently is seen taking support near 1680 levels being the confluence of the following technical parameters:a) The 61.8% retracement of the immediate previous rally from Rs 1394 to Rs 2160 is placed at Rs 1680b) The rising 21-weeks moving average which has acted as strong support for the stock in the entire up move of 2014, which is placed at Rs 1676c) The value of the rising channel in placed since March 2015 as can be seen in the adjacent chart is also placed near Rs 1680 levelsThe key observations on price and time wise behaviour during recent corrective decline substantiates the underlying positive bias in the stock. Price wise the stock has retraced its preceding six week rally (Rs 1394-2160) by only 61.8% while already consuming five weeks highlights the robust price structure.Based on the above technical parameters we believe the stock price is currently attractively placed and is set to resume its northward journey. We expect the stock to head towards Rs 2080 levels over the medium term being the 80% retracement of the entire decline from Rs 2160 and Rs 1662.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Even as a host of insurers like HDFC Life and SBI Life, among others, are readying themselves for public listing, Bajaj Finserv has ruled out any such plans for both of its two insurance subsidiaries - Bajaj Allianz Life and Bajaj Allianz General. ""We have not taken any call on the IPO so far. There is no need for us to list either of our two insurance ventures as we are already well-capitalised,"" Bajaj Finserv managing director Sanjiv Bajaj told agency.

He also said the company is already in talks with its foreign partners for increasing their stake to 49 percent in both of the insurance ventures, but added that the companies have not started a valuation process, even though Allianz had entered into an agreement with the Bajajs to increase its stake to 74 percent in life and 50 percent in general insurance company, if the law permits them to do so. The new insurance law allows only up to 49 percent FDI in both life and non-life ventures, up from 26 percent earlier. On the Q1 performance of both the life and general insurance ventures, Bajaj said, ""Non-life grew 15 percent in the first quarter, whereas our new business in life insurance grew 70 percent and our overall business grew 55 percent up from 3-4 percent in the year-ago period."" When asked about the massive attrition of agents from his life insurance company, he said, ""There were 1.5 lakh agents four years ago, but it has come down to a low 60,000 now which was deliberate as we wanted to end the part-time model of appointing agents.""",279,

E-commerce major Snapdeal has picked up majority stake in digital financial products platform, RupeePower, for an undisclosed amount through a stock and cash deal. The move will help Snapdeal to enter the Rs 4,500 crore online financial services market in the country. ""Consumers often face difficulty while deciding and buying financial products/services.

This partnership will help solve distribution challenges of the financial services ecosystem and make it more inclusive,"" Snapdeal co-founder and CEO Kunal Bahl told reporters. He declined to comment on the financial terms of the deal. Founded in 2011, Gurgaon-based RupeePower offers a digital distribution platform for loans, credit cards and other personal finance products.

At present, it has 40 employees. ""Over the next one year, we plan to ramp up our headcount to about 200 people. Most of these will be engineers, who have an understanding of the financial services market,"" RupeePower founder and CEO Tejasvi Mohanram said.

RupeePower, which counts State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Bajaj Finserv among its partners, claims to have enabled credit disbursal worth Rs 1,500 crore through its platform in FY2014-15. ""In the next 24 months, we expect this number to grow to about Rs 6,000 crore (USD one billion),"" Bahl said.

He added that going ahead, there will be integration of the platforms to allow Snapdeal consumers to make purchases using the finance options offered through RupeePower.

""The share of digital origination of credit is poised to grow from today's 7.5 percent to 40 percent over the next four years, in an Rs 400,000 crore (USD 67 billion) retail credit market growing at 20 percent annually,"" Mohanram said.

Launched in August last year, the company has already helped over 150 sellers raise over Rs 50 crore through the initiative. Asked if Snapdeal is looking at raising funds, Bahl replied in the negative. ""We have used our funds in a very efficient manner.

Raising money is a full time job and we want to focus on our business. We want to bring entrepreneurs on board (who have products and solutions) because in the long term that will help sustain the business,"" he said.",408,0.6435992240905761

Shares of Max India and Reliance Capital rallied 4-5 percent intraday Wednesday after the Cabinet approved ordinance on insurance.

Government today approved promulgation of an ordinance to hike foreign direct investment (FDI) cap in the insurance sector to 49 percent from 26 percent, as the legislation could not be passed in the Parliament session that ended on Tuesday.

The Insurance Bill, which has been pending since 2008 in the Rajya Sabha, seeks to increase the composite foreign investment limit in insurance companies to 49 percent from current level of 26 percent. The 49 percent cap would include both FDI and foreign portfolio investments.

The proposed hike in foreign investment limit to 49 percent in the insurance sector has potential to attract up to USD 7-8 billion (about Rs 50,000 crore) from overseas investors, giving a major boost to the segment.

The total capital deployed in the private life insurance sector is close to Rs 35,000 crore. At FDI at 26 percent, foreign equity is close to Rs 8,700 crore.

The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill, 2008 could not be taken up for discussion despite being approved by the Select Committee of the Upper House because of the uproar by opposition parties over the conversion and other issues.

There are 52 insurance companies operating in India, of which 24 are in the life insurance business and 28 in general insurance business. In addition, GIC is the sole national reinsurer.

Reacting to the news, Rajesh Sud, MD & CEO of Max Life Insurance says the ordinances indicate firm resolve on the government's part. However, foreign investors will view this tentatively until a Bill is passed, he adds.

An ordinance is an interim measure, a statement of intent on the part of the government. The government has six weeks after an ordinance is passed to get approval from both the houses and pass the Bill or let it lapse - after the first sitting of the Parliament.

Sud believes that the domestic ownership clause in the insurance bill will have only company-specific ramifications.

Shares in firms that have sizeable insurance businesses surged in early Mumbai trading Wednesday as the government moved a step closer to approving the proposal to increase foreign direct investment (FDI) in insurance a reality.

Last week, Parliament allowed for an extension to a select committee to table its report on the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, which seeks to up FDI in the sector from 26 percent to 49 percent.

Yesterday, the bill got a further shot in the arm after the lead opposition party Congress, which had first initiated the proposal when it was in power, said it would support the legislation even as other parties such as TMC opposed it.

The ruling BJP does not have a majority in the upper Raj Sabhya house and will need support from opposition to pass the bill through.

In early trading, Bajaj Finserv, Max India and Reliance Capital were up between 4 percent and 8 percent, following the developments.

Chennai-based Shriram Group, which failed to secure a banking licence in the recent round of licencing, has not given up the hope and is now looking at applying for a small bank licence.

The Reserve Bank had in July issued the draft guidelines for licencing of small banks and payment banks.

""The draft guidelines for small banks have been issued and we have given our suggestions and asked for some clarifications.

""Once the RBI comes out with the final guidelines and if we know that there is an opportunity for us then we will definitely apply for it,"" Shriram Group director GS Sundarajan told PTI.

He said that the group wants to get into banking space as it would fill up the gap it has in terms of our product offerings.

In the last round of banking licencing, as many as 25 corporates, including Aditya Birla Nuvo, Bajaj Finserv, Reliance Capital, LIC Housing Finance, L&T Finance and Shriram Capital, among others had applied.

The RBI, however, gave in-principle approval only to infrastructure financing firm IDFC and micro-lender Bandhan. Sundarajan said his group will apply for a small bank licence only if the regulations do not affect its existing businesses.

""If we have to convert our existing NBFCs (Non-banking financial company) into the bank then we may not be interested... we will remain an NBFC only,"" he said.

In the previous round of granting banking licence, Shriram Capital had showed its discomfort over the regulation which insisted on merging of Shriram Transport Finance Corporation and Shriram City Union into the bank if a licence were to be issued.

""We had applied with a very clear condition that we will not transfer any of our existing businesses into the bank and it was not adhering to the guidelines, and therefore we were not considered,"" Sundarajan said.

It can be noted that Tata Capital and Mahindra Finance also withdrew their application halfway expressing their disinclination to merge their existing NBFC businesses.

He said the company has also sought clarification on weather a small bank will be allowed to be operated in a few districts or in a state.

""The guidelines say you will have to start in a few districts, which is again not interesting to us as it will take us ages to become profitable,"" he said.

According to the draft guidelines, the area of operations of the small bank will normally be restricted to contiguous districts in a homogeneous cluster of states or union territories so that the bank has the local feel and culture.

However, if considered necessary, the bank will be allowed to expand its area of operations beyond contiguous districts in one or more states with reasonable geographical proximity, the guidelines stated.

""If they even give us one state then it will definitely help us to establish our presence there,"" Sundarajan added. He said the group will also be looking at applying for wholesale consumer banking licence as and when it comes.

""If that (wholesale consumer banking) is more pan-India than the small bank then we may opt for that. We are keeping all our options open but our interest in being a bank without impacting the existing businesses is still very high,"" Sundarajan said.",547,-0.9933289289474487

Vikas Gupta, Fund Manager & EVP, Arthveda Fund Management

Ben Graham, the father of value investing and Warren Buffett’s guru, is known for his keen risk averseness while investing in the highly risky asset class of equities. He transformed equities investing from a gamble and a dark art practically into a science. But before looking at his methods and how to apply them to the Indian equity markets, let’s recap why invest in equities.

Equities form an important part of any portfolio allocation. Although debt and fixed income might not fluctuate significantly on a day to day basis but the right amount of equity exposure in your portfolio can help you meet your long-term goals.

Also Read: Don't invest unless you've done your homework: Manish Arora

Equities are proven to be instrument for protecting your purchasing power over time. ArthVeda research shows that 100 invested in G-Sec bonds in 1999 would have become nearly 185 by 2012 end while price of a 100 commodity because of inflation would have become nearly 230 during the same period. This shows that the purchasing power of investor’s 100 has gone down over the period. He is able to buy only 0.8x of the commodity now or in other words his purchasing power is only 0.8x times now. Same 100 invested in Nifty index would have become nearly 485 over the same period and the purchasing power would have gone nearly 2x. Therefore, equity exposure is important to grow wealth.

When it comes to equity investing investors are often confused with plethora of stocks available to choose from. Often retail investors don’t have time, resources and expertise to do their own research. They often fall prey to“Stock Tips” from brokers and wealth advisors and more often end up losing money. They tend to overlook the motives of brokers and wealth advisors behind those tips.

Classical and most efficientapproach to investing in stock market is through value investing, as originated& developed by Ben Graham and practised& evolved by Warren Buffett. Value investing has been proven to create wealth over time. Warren Buffett often says, “You don’t need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with 160 IQ beats the guy with 130 IQ”. Investing is more about discipline and patience and less about speculation and trading.

Retail investors can create wealth for themselves from equities by following some of the simple rules of value investing. As a value-investor always look for safety first and therefore invest only in high quality stocks.Quality is often defined as companies with long history of successful operations and proven track record of sustainable book value growth for its shareholders. Quality criteria also include companies with low financial risk, strong profitability and competitive edge over their competitors.

Considering limited time and resources retail investors can do a quick screen for quality companies by focusing on companies with net cash balance sheet so that there is low bankruptcy risk. Further investors can screen for companies creating shareholder value by generating good return on equity. Return on equity over 20% is a good benchmark for a high quality company.

Post screening for quality stocks value-investors also screen for price they would want to pay for the quality. Warren Buffett says, “Price is what you pay and value is what you get”. Value investors will always look for opportunities where price is at a discount to the value. This discount is referred as “margin-of-safety” by Graham. The margin-of-safety provides downside protection to the investment.

Just as poor quality stock trading at cheap valuation is not worth buying similarly a high quality stock trading at expensive valuation is not a good investment opportunity. As a simple measure of valuation retail-investors might want to screen for quality companies trading at a cheap price to earnings ratio. Current Nifty valuation is about 17x last 12months earning.

Putting a margin-of-safety criterion of about 30%investors can screen for companies trading at or below 12x price to trailing earnings. For further comfort investors can look for dividend paying companies so that there is some relief on the cash flow generation capability of the companies and can also enjoy a regular income from their investment. Nifty index is trading at a dividend yield of about 1.5% so it might be worth looking for companies yielding more than Index say at a 2.5% yield or more.

Combining all the above criteria of quality and valuation i.e. net cash companies with ROE more than 20% trading at trailing PE of 12x of less and yielding 2.5% or more and applying it to universe of top 500 listed stocks one would end up-with some 7 stocks what we call as Safe-Seven. These Safe-Seven companies are some of the high quality stocks available at a great bargain prices. Safe-Seven includes following stocks: Coal India, NMDC, BHEL, Engineers India, Gujarat Gas Company, BalmerLawrie Investment, Maharashtra Scooters.

Retail investors can create an equi-weight portfolio of these seven stocks and hold it for long. This would be an all-cap portfolio with Coal India, NMDC and BHEL being large cap stocks, Engineers India and Gujarat Gas being mid-cap stocks and BalmerLawrie Investment and Maharashtra Scooters being small cap stocks. The Safe-Seven portfolio companies have an average market cap of nearly 43,000 Cr., an averagenet cash of about 22% of their market cap and an average ROE of about 28%. The portfolio stocks are yielding on an average about 4.3% in dividends and have average cash adjusted PE of about 7x.

A closer look at the companies in the Safe-Seven portfolio would reveal that these are primarily government owned companies. Investing in government owned companies is not bad. These companies follow stringent corporate governance policies. Promoter risk involved is low as compared to private companies. Further, being government owned they need to go through the CAG audit and have to maintain a good level of transparency with the government as well as other investors. They are being monitored and rated on stringent performance criteria on a regular basis.

The Safe-Seven companies are cash rich with monopoly in their niche. Coal India has a monopoly in coal production in India and produces nearly 80% of Indian coal. NMDC is the leader in producing finest quality of iron-ore and has majority share in Indian iron-ore reserves. BHEL on the other hand is India’s largest power equipment manufacturer in India with over 50% market share. Engineers India is India’s largest EPC and consulting company for oil and gas sector in India with most stable customer base and strong technical expertise.

Gujarat Gas Company is one of the oldest and the largest gas distribution company in the state of Gujarat and has a clear monopoly. BalmerLawrie Investment is a listed special purpose vehicle which holds majority of BalmerLawrie Ltd. BalmerLawrie Ltd. itself is a multi-business conglomerate with interest in manufacturing of industrial packaging material, production of grease & lubricant and performance chemical.

Company is also providing service in logistics and tours & travel. Maharashtra scooter promoted by Maharashtra government is an auto component manufacturer but its real value lies in its holdings in Bajaj Holding which in turn holds Bajaj Auto and Bajaj Finserv. Bajaj Finserv is the holding company for Bajaj Finance—an NBFC—and Bajaj’s life insurance and general insurance ventures. So although the safe-seven portfolio consist of only seven stocks but the investors get underlying exposure to many more businesses. This makes safe-seven a well-diversified portfolio of quality stocks available at a cheap valuation.

While all these stocks look attractive one should keep in mind equity investments are subjected to risk. There are number of risk associated with equity in general however not every risk may materializes. One of the biggest risk specific to PSU investing is government ownership. Cash rich PSUs could become source of cash for government where they might be forced to pay out higher dividends or buy back stake. This could be a highly likely event given the fact that government is running behind in its divestment schedule.

Further there is a big risk that cash rich PSUs may be forced to buy-out other loss making government business. Such corporate governance error at government part leads to significant undervaluation in PSU stocks. Investors should take a cautious view of these opportunities but should take advantage of such mispricing through careful analysis.

Despite the Tatas pulling out of the race to get a bank licence, Bajaj Finance has no intention of following suit. Sanjiv Bajaj, MD, Bajaj Finserv even brushes aside rumours of Bajaj Auto being worried about the impact on its exclusivity deal if Bajaj Finance were to get a banking lisence. Bajaj Finance, infact, continues to have strategic deals with Baja Auto.

He says the slowdown in the economy has had an impact on the financing business. But a stable government at the Centre can give an immediate fillip to the consumer mood, he adds.

In the life insurance business, he sees growth in 2014 to be better than 2013. He says the life insurance business is seeing changes due to product regulation. The group’s general insurance business has grown at 15 percent this year, which is healthy given the existing environment.

Below is the verbatim transcript of Sanjiv Bajaj's interview on CNBC-TV18

Q: Since we last spoke there have been some developments. Tatas have pulled out of bank license. Are you also contemplating pulling out or would you stay put?

A: We are still very much in the running. Our application is there with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and we have no intention of pulling out.

Q: There were some reports with regards to bank licenses indicating that Bajaj Auto was worried that maybe there could be some amount of an impact on the exclusive deal that they have with Bajaj Finance. The restructuring process I am sure is underway at this point in time, but are there any hiccups that you all are facing on the same?

A: There are no hiccups over there. It is very common with auto manufacturers around the world to have either a captive financing relationship or a preferred relationship depending on country by country, either with your own entity if it were allowed or then with an external entity and if you see again in India, the US, Japan it is also a fairly common model.

To that extent Bajaj Finance as we all know started off as a captive auto financier for Bajaj Auto and over the last 6-7 years has converted itself into a diversified financing company wherein one vertical still continues to have a strategic relationship with Bajaj Auto. This works even today on a completely arm's length basis. So buying credit, credit policies, what margins, how to manage loss ratios, this is all done independently but the two companies engaged in a lot of customer related information, strategic areas where the financing company supports the auto business, the auto business on the other hand allows access in its dealerships to the auto finance vertical, thereby giving them first choice of customers. So it is a very positive win-win situation. My understanding is that Bajaj Auto in a similar way has a preferred relationship with a couple of other banks as well, because given the size of their business they have to do overall what is right in their interest.

In the same way for Bajaj Finance we believe it was very important to have a long-term strategy to build a diversified lending business, so that we are not exposed to external events in any one single line of business. This has helped Bajaj Finance significantly over the last 6-7 years. Our own belief looking at the guidelines is that going forward to have such a strategic relationship as long as it is arm's length is not an issue and on this premise is what we have gone ahead and applied as well.

Q: How exactly the life insurance business panning out at this point in time? It was a bit sluggish in the previous quarter and if you can also touch upon the general insurance business.

A: Starting with the life insurance business, in the last three years the life insurance business has undergone three significant situations, one was the new product guidelines in Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIP) in September 2010, then was a period of hyper competition in the two years thereafter and from February this year the new product guidelines on the remaining products which become effective now, part of them became effective from August 1 and the rest of them will become effective from January 1.

So the industry business model has evolved significantly. As far as Bajaj Allianz is concerned when we saw the hyper competition three years ago, we decided that in the interest of long-term sustainability and building a solid business it did not make sense to throw capital at irrational competitions by market share and so between September 2010 and September 2012 we actually stepped back, cut down on business and looked at focusing more on building a solid foundation. Last year on the other hand when everybody else was cutting down and the industry on new business fell last year by nearly 8-10 percent, we grew 10 percent. So we chose when to grow, when not to. This year again has seen a lot of changes because of the change in product regulations. Some of them on group products as I mentioned earlier came out from August 1, the rest will come out from January 1. What this has necessitated is a complete review of our business model of distribution and selling.

A typical model right from LIC days was where you have hundreds of thousands of part-time agents and if you actually think of it as a funnel for agents, the full-time ones start going down the funnel and become your long-term agents whereas the part-time ones keep changing. Given the new product structure this funnel has certainly become very narrow. It is too expensive to manage 2-3 lakh agents in this period and hence I believe the smarter way to look at agency is smaller group of more productive, more active agents and hence a smaller team in the company to manage those so that you focus on building quality, because an agent who earlier sold 2-3 policies a month earned Rs 15,000-20,000, he will now trail on Rs 5,000 doing that, so it is not viable for him anymore.

What we have to do is to get the agents focused on the right customer segments, focused on different ticket sizes for a policy and then focused on productivity. Doing this with 150,000 agents which is what the group we work with is impossible. So we have already started narrowing down agents to a more active group and then over the years we will build it up again, because long-term as long as you get the right productivity mix, as long as you get the right customer segmentation and focus I believe a large agency force is very positive to a life insurance company.

There is a second set of guidelines to do around bancassurance and how banks are supposed to now deal with selling insurance. Here there are a set of guidelines from Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), there are set of guidelines from RBI, Finance Ministry has a view on this, so I think this is still very much work in progress. As far as overall business is concerned I am hopeful that keeping in mind some growth in the economy in 2013-14 beyond where we are right now we will start seeing positive growth in new business for the life insurance industry. For ourselves even in this year our new business is just about the same as last year. It is a little higher, but we hope to see it stronger in the next year. So that is the life insurance business.

General insurance business ends up being more stable, partly because it is an annual business, annually you are renewing a whole bunch of different types of products. Here again we have so far grown at 15 percent this year which is very healthy in the existing environment, more importantly, we have grown very strong metrics on good and efficient customer service, high levels of transparency in the way we managed claims and also doing all this at a reasonable profit level. In general insurance you can sometimes get bogged down by very high claims and hence how you distribute risks across different product lines becomes very important. We have consciously stayed majorly as a retail general insurance company. So 70-75 percent of our business is retail. 20-25 percent is corporate. We do selectively corporate business. This helps us manage our risk far better than if we were predominantly corporate.",1440,0.2864552438259125

Banking is the buzz of the season. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has received a set of 26 applications for the new banking licence across the spectrum. If ""credible brand"" remains one of the key determinants for final selection, Pune-based Bajaj Finance holds potential chances to access public savings, the cheapest source of funds for any institution.Meanwhile, the company is leaving no stone unturned to lay a concrete foundation for its banking forays. The non-banking finance company (NBFC) owned by the renowned Bajaj group is so far known for serving affluent customers. It is considered to be India's largest white good financing company that gives loans to buy TV, fridge, air conditioner (AC), washing machine, micro oven and other appliances.""We will convert Bajaj Finance into bank if RBI issues us a licence, "" Rajeev Jain, CEO, Bajaj Finance told moneycontrol.com.""As per RBI guidelines, we will have 18 months time for such conversion. We have enough the required wherewithal to do the business of banking. Through our current NBFC set-up, we are primarily serving affluent customers. However, we are trying to expand our product kitty to include more customers. We have just entered the rural markets,"" he said.Bajaj Finance is the subsidiary of Bajaj Finserv , which has actually applied for a banking licence.In June, the company launched its financing business in rural markets with seven specialised and 30 franchised branches across Maharashtra. It plans to disburse around Rs 175-180 crore loans in the current financial year.""We are positively surprised at the initial response. There is a significant demand from the rural population to buy LCD/LED TVs. By 2014, we will open another set of seven branches and 30 spokes (franchised units) in rural Gujarat. We will gradually expand this business, "" Jain said.With this retail initiative, Bajaj Finance made its foot-print for the first time in the rural belt. One can juxtapose the move with the RBI’s mandate of 25 percent rural branches for new banks.The company is operating in the same product vertical (consumer durable). However, it will now be exposed to the rural masses particularly for financial products. In the auto segment, Bajaj group is already an established brand.Later, mopping up public deposits wherein the ‘trust’ is the key factor will not be any insurmountable task for Bajaj Finance. It can also sell other form of loans.Earlier in January, 2013; Bajaj Finance had launched home loan products for its affluent customers, whose yearly income is not below 12 lakh.""We are lending to those customers with an average ticket size of Rs 60-70 lakh. It goes above Rs 1 crore metro cities, "" the CEO added.The home loan experience, according to market analysts, will add value to the NBFC, which will have to run home loan products in a large scale if they finally obtain a banking licence.As of June 30, 2013; its total assets under management (AUM) stood at Rs 19,230 crore, up 33 percent year-on-year. Out of total assets, a big chunk to the tune of 40 percent is mortgaged. saikat.das@network18online.com",518,0.0

Pune-based diversified finance company Bajaj Finserv will be raising Rs 1,000 crore by December, mainly to participate in the proposed capital raising plan of its non-banking lending subsidiary, a top official has said.



""We will be raising Rs 1,000 crore before the end of the third quarter,"" Managing Director Sanjiv Bajaj told PTI. The money will be raised through a rights issue, he said, adding, the board has approved the proposed issue at its meeting yesterday.



The holding company, which is present in segments like lending to finance consumer durables, equipments and both life and general insurance, plans to plough the money to fund its share in its non-banking subsidiary Bajaj Finance's proposed capital raising, he said.



The listed Bajaj Finance is targeting to raise up to Rs 750 crore in the last quarter of this fiscal but is yet to firm up its mind on the route to be taken.



Bajaj also declined to comment on the route to be taken by the subsidiary.



Yesterday, Bajaj Finserv reported a 51% rise in consolidated net in the June quarter to Rs 195 crore on the back of a healthy 53% jump in Bajaj Finance's net to Rs 139 crore.



Both its insurance subsidiaries -- Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company -- ended the quarter in profit, reporting a PAT of Rs 65 crore and Rs 74 crore, respectively.



When asked if the company will contemplate taking its life insurance vertical public once regulatory clarity comes in, Bajaj replied in the negative, saying such a move is not on the cards as the company is well capitalised.",281,8.124113082885742e-05

Indian corporate houses, eager to enter the banking sector, are gearing up to battle for the few licences that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to issue.

RBI releases Draft Guidelines for Licensing of New Banks in the Private Sector

Analysts and industry players expect the RBI to issue two to five new licences, meaning most of the more than 10 corporate groups that have expressed interest in setting up a bank may be disappointed.

India has not issued a new banking licence since 2004 and has said it will only issue a few new licenses. The RBI is looking to expand access to banking services in a country where more than half of families are outside the formal financial sector.

""Going by the history, I don't think the RBI will issue more than four or at most five licences this time. There will be a lot of filtering, it's going to be stringent,"" Pradeep Agarwal, analyst with Emkay Broking, said.

Corporate groups including the Tata group and billionaire Anil Ambani's

Reliance Capital

, which both operate non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), are among those interested in seeking banking licences in a country where lending is growing at about 20% a year.

Religare Enterprises

,

Bajaj Finserv

,

Aditya Birla group

and

Mahindra Finance

, among others, are also keen to enter the segment.

Religare, controlled by billionaire brothers Malvinder and Shivinder Singh, said on Tuesday it has set up an advisory panel that would help it apply for a licence and is also open to partnership with global lenders.

The Reserve Bank of India's draft guidelines limit foreign shareholdings in start-up banks to 49% for the first five years and allow no single foreign owner to hold more than 5%. New licence-holders would also be required to list their banks on the stock market within two years.

""They only want serious players who seriously view this business and understand the economics of it over a long period of time,"" Religare Chief Executive Sachindra Nath told Reuters.

The RBI in its draft guidelines issued on Monday said that it will consider granting licences to private firms with successful track records of at least 10 years and with low exposure to the real estate, construction and broking businesses.

""From a long-term perspective one can grow through banks. Your customer base in a bank is much more diversified, you can sell much more products to your customers, and obviously your funding is easier,"" said Sam Ghosh, chief executive officer of Reliance Capital.

He said Reliance Capital meets the RBI guidelines and will need to set up a non-operating holding company to seek a licence.

Many firms planning to apply for banking licences already operate non-banking finance companies, which provide mostly small loans to consumers and businesses.
