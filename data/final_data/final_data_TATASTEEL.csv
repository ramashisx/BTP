Tata Steel share price gained over a percent in the morning trade on November 21 after international brokerage Jefferies maintained a positive outlook on the company.

Its analysts expect Tata Steel's India margins to expand in the December quarter and Tata Steel Europe (TSE) losses to narrow by Q4 FY24. The brokerage sees up to 40 percent upside in the stock in a bull case scenario.

Tata Steel's European business is facing severe margin pressure due to the ongoing restructuring in the UK (TSUK) and blast furnace relining in the Netherlands (TSN). Since the TSN relining is expected to be completed by December, Jefferies expects it to lift profitability in the fourth quarter.

The company’s UK margin may also improve from the current lows but is likely to remain weak during the transition period of building a new 3mtpa EAF over the next three years, the brokerage said.

Analysts at Jefferies like Tata's improving asset footprint with rising Indian share in total volumes.

""Asian steel spread has already contracted to the lowest level in a decade, and any positive developments in China could provide upside,"" they said. In the base case scenario, the brokerage has pegged target price at Rs 145.

Better Asian steel spreads and sequential improvement in margins are expected to be the key triggers for the stock.

In an upside scenario, the brokerage sees up to 40 percent rally in the counter to Rs 175 a share. However, emissions, energy management and factors such as human rights and community relations, air quality, and employee health and safety remain some of the key material issues, it said.

The company's plan to reduce carbon emission and its capex for this transition will be keenly eyed in the near team. The management will have to share what is the share of renewables in the energy mix and how this will change in coming years.

At 10.05 am, Tata Steel was trading at Rs 125.60 on the National Stock Exchange, 1.01 percent higher from the previous close. The stock has gained around 5 percent this year, underperforming the benchmark Nifty, which has risen over 8 percent during the time.

Shares of Tata Steel Limited traded 1.6 percent higher to Rs 123 in early trade on November 15 following its Dutch subsidiary's announcement to cut 800 jobs, in a bid to enhance its market position and curb operational costs.

“The steel market has been in dire straits for some time now. In order to remain structurally competitive and profitable now and in the future, Tata Steel Netherlands is taking drastic measures, including a reduction of 800 jobs in IJmuiden,” the statement from the company read.

The cut is slated to affect 500 permanent employees, and the remaining 300 job cuts will involve temporary workers and non-production-related vacancies.

This strategic move is part of the company's broader effort to become a cleaner, greener, and more circular steel company. Despite the job cuts, Tata Steel Netherlands clarified that the reduction won't result in a complete freeze on vacancies, acknowledging the ongoing need for technically trained personnel.

Tata's steel factory in the Netherlands currently contributes approximately 7 percent of the country's total CO2 emissions, making it the largest single polluter.

Although the company is collaborating with the Dutch government to transition to more sustainable steel production methods, a formal agreement on the required support has not been reached.

The government is looking into issues surrounding dumping of certain categories of steel products into the Indian market, Steel Secretary Nagendra Nath Sinha said on November 7. The statement comes amid the industry raising concerns over the rise in steel imports.

In October India remained the net importer of steel. The Ministry of Finance is looking at dumping issues of certain categories of steel products and will take a final call on the anti-dumping duty, Sinha told reporters at the '4rth ISA Steel Conclave' event here.

According to SteelMint India, the country's steel imports were higher at 0.46 Million Tonnes (MT) in October, compared to 0.24 MT exports. On coking coal supplies, the official said the government is making efforts to secure coking coal through alternate sources and is in talks with Russia and Mongolia for supply of the steel-making raw material.

India is the largest importer of metallurgical coal, which includes Pulverised Coal Injection (PCI) with annual inbound shipments in the range of 70-75 MT. The imports are mainly from countries like Australia, the US, Canada, and Mozambique.

When asked about the second phase of the production-linked incentive for the steel sector, the secretary said it is at the discussion level. Meanwhile, Tata Steel CEO & MD T V Narendran said India being a net importer of steel is a matter of concern.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Steel

We cut our FY24E/25E/26E EBITDA estimates by 2%/6%/4% on higher coking coal prices and higher losses from TSUK in 1HFY24. Tata Steel’s (TATA) consolidated operating performance was affected by weak Tata Steel Europe (TSE) in 2Q. Tata Steel India (TSI) performance was in-line with EBITDA/t of Rs14,006 while TSE EBITDA loss widened QoQ to USD169/t due to weak demand and lower production from Tata Steel Netherlands (TSN). In 3Q, TSI is expected to deliver stronger EBITDA/t as expected coking coal price hike is just USD10/t for TSI; while weak TSE performance is likely to be negated by lower coking coal prices due to inventory lag effect at TSN (~USD60/t). Key parameters to watch are a) progress on consultation process with unions at Tata Steel UK (TSUK) which is ongoing and b) commissioning of Kalinganagar blast furnace (KPO II) & stabilization which will drive volume growth in FY25/26E.

Outlook

We expect Revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 5%/9%/28% over FY23-26E. At CMP, stock is trading at 5.3x/4.8x EV of FY25E/FY26E EBITDA. Retain ‘BUY’ rating with revised TP of Rs138 (earlier Rs144) valuing at 6x EV of Sept 2025E TSI EBITDA, as we roll forward.

Tata Steel reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 6,511 crore in the second quarter of 2023-24 hit by impairment charges and provision for restructuring, but the company does not expect any more one-time impact in the rest of the fiscal, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer TV Narendran told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview.

Narendran however remained non-committal when asked if the company would end the year in red given the losses in the first half.

The steelmaker expects India demand and margins to remain strong going ahead. In the UK, it is still working on its plan for Port Talbot to finalise the job cuts.

From Tata Steel’s future plans, debt reduction to pollution read the edited excerpts of the interview here:

Europe's performance was expected to be weak in Q2 but the loss is significantly higher than what the street estimated. Shares have also reacted to the number. The most important thing people want to know is that is this the last of the impairment and restructuring provisions we will see.

We have undertaken all the impairments that we needed to do, and also factored in the restructuring costs; that’s why we reported loss in Q2. We thought it's better for us to take the hit in this quarter so we know exactly what's going to happen going forward. Operationally, it was a challenging quarter. India has been strong as far as demand growth is concerned. Pricing started picking up towards the end of the quarter. International prices continued to be weak.

In Europe, while the UK has always struggled in challenging markets, in the Netherlands, it had more to do with the blast furnace relining that we are going through. We were operating with just one blast furnace, which means only 60% of the production. The negative numbers in the Netherlands are unusual. I think operationally we were close to what most analysts thought we would deliver. The impairments were one-off, most people knew that we would take some impairment but didn't know the amount.

So does that mean you don't expect any further impairments in the rest of the year? And that the restructuring provisions that you have done, does that take care of the entire plan?

Yes, that's the expectation. In the UK, we have now pretty much cleaned up the book.

You were expected to make an announcement about the future of Port Talbot and potential job losses, which are estimated at around 3,000 job cuts. There has been a delay and the lack of clarity has not gone down well. Would you like to elaborate on your plan?

There is some confusion about the delay. We were supposed to do a call with the media after the result on Nov 1, but we had to push it because by the time the results got uploaded, it was quite late. There was some expectation in the UK that we were going to do a press conference to announce job cuts, whereas we were doing a press conference to discuss Q2 results.

Things are a bit sensitive out there. Everyone knows that there will be job cuts. What is the amount of job cuts is what we are consulting with the unions. And that's a discussion we are having with them. We are required to go through meaningful consultation. And that process is going on.

At the end of the consultation, we will have a very clear path ahead and defined timelines. But we need to get the unions on the same page.

Even if there was confusion on the announcement, can you give us a timeline as to when you expect to make some statement on that?

We have said there will be job losses. It would be unfair for us to give a specific number when we are in the middle of a consultation with the unions. There are expectations, which today have been shared with the unions. But we are obligated to go through that consultation process. But yes, it's clear that if we have to restructure the business and run a new process route, there will be an impact on jobs. We don't like it. But I think the objective is in some sense, to make sure that we have a sustainable business in the UK, we continue to make steel in the UK.

We use an electric arc furnace operation because we can leverage the scrap that is available in the UK. And we use as much of our workforce that we can use in the UK. We've committed a lot of money over the last decade or so to keep the steel-making activity in the UK alive. And I think this is the best chance that we have to create a sustainable future for the business.

India's steel demand remained resilient despite seasonal rains while EU steel demand was subdued by the economic slowdown. How is the rest of the year looking for steel demand in Europe and India?

In India, the demand has been very strong. I don't think I have seen a 10% growth in steel consumption in a long time. That's because all engines are firing. Automotive has been strong for the last six to eight months, even two-wheelers, which have been weak have come back, which is also a reflection that the rural markets are picking up, because motorcycle sales, in some sense, indicate the strength or the weakness of the rural markets. Construction has been strong.

In fact, surprisingly so even during the monsoon months, maybe, as always cyclical during monsoon months, but not as bad as we've seen in the past. And we expect a lot of activity to pick up from now till the elections, because a lot of projects need to get completed, and so on and so forth. So the demand has been very strong in India. The pricing is a little bit more reflective of what's happening in the international markets.

As far as Europe is concerned, this year is a bad year as far as demand is concerned. Auto has been okay, but most of the sectors are struggling. But I think next year, the World Steel Association forecast is that European demand should grow by about 3%.

What’s the outlook for price and realisation in the third quarter and for the rest of the fiscal year?

I think the guidance we're giving on prices in India is a net realisation increase of about Rs 2200 per ton in Q3 over Q2 because that's where we see the Indian market. Europe is going to be weaker. In Europe, particularly in the Netherlands, we have a lot of long-term contracts which will come up for negotiation. These will reflect the current prices which are lower than the prices a year ago. We will see price reductions in the UK and Netherlands, but you will also see coal consumption costs reducing in the UK and Netherlands. In India, the coal consumption costs will go up, because we have already consumed the low-cost code.

There will be margin expansion in India, to some extent. In the Netherlands, there will be margin expansion simply because the blast furnace will come back in operation towards the end of this month. But you will see a better quarter in Q4 in the Netherlands, which is closer to what we normally see in the Netherlands. So I do see things getting better in H2 compared to H1.

What’s the outlook on raw material prices, especially energy costs? Also, globally steelmakers are working towards securing coking coal, what’s your strategy?

As long as you use blast furnaces, you will need to use coking coal. In the UK, we are transitioning away from a blast furnace route to an electric arc furnace route. This means we will use scrap and electricity and if that electricity is green, then you're even better off. In the Netherlands, the plan is to move from blast furnaces to gas-based steelmaking.

Eventually, when hydrogen is available in the Netherlands, we will transition from gas to hydrogen. In India, the challenge is that we don’t have much gas available in the eastern parts. Whether it's the pipeline infrastructure or port infrastructure, a lot needs to be built.

So till such time, we are dependent on blast furnaces and using coking coal. But having said that, we are looking at whatever gas is available to reduce the CO2 footprint by using more gas than we traditionally do. We're not making a process shift, but we are trying to see if we can inject gases wherever we can to reduce the use of coal.

Tata Steel has been talking to GAIL for gas supplies and infrastructure. Will this be done in FY24?

We've come to some sort of an understanding with GAIL. For the Jamshedpur plant, we should be able to get some gas. We will announce when we conclude the discussion. GAIL is also looking at supplying gas to Jamshedpur city. A lot of our future capacity is going to come up in at Kalinganagar, Neelachal and Meramandali, so we're looking at overall gas availability in the east. I think we will be adding at least 100 million tons of capacity every decade in India and in eastern India over the next few decades. It's important to have gas available so that we can switch from coal-based process routes to gas-based process routes in the future.

As for the arrangement with GAIL, there are a few loose ends to tie up. We hope to do it sooner than later so that we can move forward.

With the mounting losses so in H1FY24, would Tata Steel close FY24 in red?

I don't want to give specific guidance. If not for this impairment, the numbers would have looked much better. But I think this impairment was something which was inevitable and we had to take it sooner than later. I expect the second half to be better than the first half. Let's see if we can make up for the negative numbers that we have had in H1.

Q. You have an ambitious target of doubling India's capacity. Does the loss impact that plan or that remains unchanged?

So I think just now as far as growth in India is concerned, our focus is on completing the Kalinganagar project which is at its final stages, so that that can translate into becoming a cash-generating unit in some sense of the term. We have the Ludhiana project of an electric arc furnace, which is a green process route, which should come up in two years. So these two projects are going on and I think we want to complete it as soon as possible. For new projects, we will obviously look at our balance sheet and decide when to pace it, and when to start it, because that's the advantage of organic growth, you can pace it well.

We have the opportunity to double, like I said, we are already moving to 25 million tonnes with the Kalinganagar expansion. That means we have another 15 million tonnes which we can build in Kalinganagar, Neelachal and in Meramandali, but we are also conscious about what is the debt on our balance sheet and how we find the right balance.

So we will keep reviewing that and share with you the plans as we make them. But the opportunity is there, the intention is there. We just need to keep an eye on the debt as well.

With losses in the first two quarters, where do you stand on the plan to reduce debt by $1 billion in the fiscal year 2023-24?

I don't think we will ever give up on the plan. Now, whether we are optimistic about achieving it, that's a different matter. The intent is to have a healthy balance sheet and how do we balance our growth aspirations, with a healthy balance sheet. Yes, we've had a setback in Europe, it's been worse than we thought. We can debate whether India could have generated more cash. But I think the intent is to see how we can have a good balance sheet and achieve our growth aspirations as well. And that's what we're working on.

Pollution is a serious issue in Mumbai, Delhi and other cities like Jamshedpur where the city was built around your plant. How do you see this issue evolving in terms of the pollution levels in bigger cities and in cities which have an industrial presence? What needs to be done in the short and long term to curb pollution?

For industrial plants, we are not limited by, but we are driven by the regulations and the regulatory environment gets tighter and tighter. Every time we go over the plan to expand the plant capacities, we are told that this is what the emission level should be and we comply. I can say that Jamshedpur's production capacity of 10 million tonnes right now is emitting less than it was emitting when it was producing 5 million tonnes. That's the kind of improvement that we made.

But we want to keep making improvements and many projects are continuing. In the next few years, you will see the emission levels in Jamshedpur will keep dropping. I sometimes feel we have much cleaner air in Jamshedpur than most of the other big cities in India, which don't have a steel plant in the middle of the city. I am not saying we can't do better, but I think we give our citizens a fairly clean environment.

As far as India is concerned, I think there are multiple sources– industrial plants, vehicles, construction activity, and in Delhi even stubble burning. There are multiple sources and one needs to act on all sources and see what is the best balance that we can get. The AQI levels across India, in multiple sites in India, are far higher than it is in global cities. I think we need to do a good job on that. I think many developing countries including China are already moving a lot in that direction and I think India is also moving in some sense in that direction.",2385,0.3700311217043135

Tata Steel will start consultations with the UK unions to discuss about the restructuring moves at its Port Talbot site as the company shifts to electric-arc furnace production, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer TV Narendran said in an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol on November 2.

He denied media reports that the company delayed the announcement on job cuts, after a scheduled press conference was cancelled by the company late on Wednesday evening soon after it put out a grim quarterly results.

""There will be an impact on jobs. We don't like it but I think the objective is to make sure that we have a sustainable business in the UK and we continue to make steel in the UK,"" said Narendran.

UK media reported that the company was set to announce the shutting of blast furnaces at the Welsh plant as it pivots to install a low-emission plant. Staff had been braced for up to 3,000 job cuts and confirmation of the closure of two blast furnaces, according to The Guardian.

""There is some confusion on the delay because yesterday we were supposed to do a call with the media, but we had to push it because by the time the results got uploaded, it was quite late,"" Narendran said in an interview with Moneycontrol.

Tata Steel expects margin expansion from its India business unit on the back of buoyant domestic demand from the automotive and construction sectors, managing director TV Narendran said in an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol.

Indian steel demand remained steady, helped by robust government spending on infrastructure projects ahead of elections, helping steelmakers to rake in a profit in the country while global demand reflected a bleak picture.

Domestic steel consumption was up about 10 percent in the quarter that ended September from the previous quarter, according to the company’s investor presentation.

“That's because all engines are firing,"" Narendran said, referring to the growth. ""Automotive has been strong for the last six to eight months. Even two-wheelers, which have been weak, have come back, which is also a reflection that the rural markets are picking up because of motorcycle sales.”

Domestic deliveries for the quarter jumped 6 percent YoY, the company said.

The India business generated a higher margin of about 20 percent, EBITDA of Rs 6,841 crore and crude steel production of about 5 million tonnes, offsetting the grim results in Europe. However, Narendran flagged that actual costs in the country will go up as low-cost coal had already been consumed in the quarter.

""So there will be margin expansion in India to some extent,"" added Narendran.

Tata Steel’s consolidated net loss for July-September came in at Rs 6,511 crore, against a net profit of Rs 1,297 crore a year ago. Revenue fell on an on-year basis. Analysts had expected a net loss of about Rs 700 crore.

However, analysts believe that Tata Steel's huge consolidated net loss in the quarter is a one-off item.

At 9:18 am, Tata Steel shares were trading marginally lower at Rs 116.30 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

The company's Europe business remains a drag. However, domestic EBITDA coming in ahead of estimates is positive. Another good news was the impact of lower realisations being more than offset by lower 'other' capex.

Morgan Stanley maintains an 'Equal Weight' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 115 per share.

Focus on restructuring, other provisions

Tata Steel continued to flag ongoing concern for its European business citing inadequate cash flow and liquidity. The company has taken steps toward restructuring and other provisions. Given their plans to change the processed route for steelmaking, the existing heavy-end assets at TSUK will only be used for a defined period.

“Accordingly, we have taken an impairment charge of Rs 12,560 crore in the standalone financial statements. We have also taken a charge of Rs 6,358 crore in consolidated financial statements in relation to the UK business,” said Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer, in a statement.

“The company continues to remain focused on cost optimisation, operational improvements, and working capital management to maximise cash flows,” Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director, and Chief Financial Officer, said in a statement.

Tata Steel reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 6,511 crore in the second quarter of 2023-24 as against a net profit of Rs 1,297 crore a year ago, as the company was hit by a double whammy of impairment charges and shrinking margins in Europe.

Late evening on November 1, the Tata group steelmaker reported a consolidated total revenue from operations of Rs 55,681 crore, as against Rs 59,877 crore reported in the year-ago period. While the street had expected that the company would report a consolidated loss, it had pegged it at much lower levels at Rs 700 crore, according to five analysts polled by Moneycontrol.

“India business generated a higher margin of around 20% and EBITDA stood at Rs 6,841 crore. In Europe, margins moderated especially in UK business while Netherlands business was broadly stable on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ basis). Revenue per ton was lower in both geographies. However, improved costs in the Netherlands led to broadly similar margins,” Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer, said in a statement.

Ahead of the results, shares of Tata Steel closed at Rs 116.60 on November 1 on BSE, down 1.8 percent from the previous close.

Provisions weigh on bottomline

The company said that it has assessed the potential impact of the Electric Arc Furnace route (EAF) based decarbonisation project and restructuring in Tata Steel UK (TSUK). Subsequently, it has undertaken an impairment charge of Rs 12,560 crore in standalone financial statements and Rs 2,746 crore in consolidated financial statements. Tata Steel continued to flag going concern for its European business citing inadequate cash flow and liquidity.

Tata Steel has also taken a charge towards restructuring and other provisions of Rs 3,612 crore in consolidated financial statements.

“Given our plans to change the processed route for steelmaking, the existing heavy-end assets at TSUK will only be used for a defined period. Accordingly, we have taken an impairment charge of Rs 12,560 crore in the standalone financial statements. We have also taken a charge of Rs 6,358 crore in consolidated financial statements in relation to the UK business. We continue to remain focused on cost optimisation, operational improvements and working capital management to maximise cashflows,” Chatterjee said.

In September, the UK government agreed to give a grant of £500 million to help Tata Steel decarbonise its Port Talbot project at Wales, after months of negotiations to save the project, the company said in a statement. Tata Steel will have to invest the balance in the total capital cost of £1.25 billion.

Europe Operations

Tata Steel Europe (TSE) recorded revenues of Rs 18,846.7 crore in the quarter as against Rs 21,558.8 crore a year ago.

Analysts had said ahead of the results that the company witnessed a weak performance in Europe due to lower shipments and decreased realisations.

""TSUK continues to implement various measures aimed at improving its business performance and conserving cash including but not limited to ensuring adequate liquidity, if required, through available financing options, management of working capital and implementation of cost reduction measures,"" the company said.

Standalone performance

Total revenue from operations was Rs 33,223.2 crore In Q2FY24, down from Rs 34,642.8 crore a year earlier.

On a standalone basis, the company swung to a net loss of Rs 8,530.6 crore as against a profit of Rs 2,214.5 crore in the same period last year. Impairment charges dented the bottomline despite total expenses declining 10 percent year-on-year to Rs 29,022 crore.

Crude steel production in Q2FY24 was around 5 million tons and was broadly similar on a QoQ basis but up 5 percent on a YoY basis. Deliveries stood at 4.82 million tons, marginally higher from the previous quarter.

TV Narendran, Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director, said in a statement, “Tata Steel India delivered steady performance, with crude steel production of around 5 million tons. Domestic deliveries were up 6 percent YoY, despite renewed volatility and seasonal factors during the quarter.

“We expect EBITDA leverage to decline over the next three years on higher capacity, output and EBITDA.

Tata Steel Ltd is turning to gas to reduce its carbon emissions even as it explores other cleaner options for energy in the long term. But the share of coal in its energy mix may remain the same, despite the company's ambitious plan to double its manufacturing capacity.

As Tata Steel aims to double its production capacity in India to 40 million tonne per annum by 2030, it is faced with the dual challenge of reducing its carbon emission while keeping its costs under check. While the company is exploring alternate sources of energy for use across its supply chain, it comes with a price and could potentially hurt its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA).

“Currently, coal is our primary fuel to produce quality steel in India. However, we are working on various energy mix to diversify the energy basket,” Uttam Singh, vice president, iron making, Tata Steel, told Moneycontrol.

Tata Steel aims to achieve emission intensity of less than 2 tCO2/tcs by 2025 and reach ‘net zero’ by 2045. As of the financial year 2022-23, Tata Steel’s consolidated emission intensity was at 2.21 tCO2/tcs, while on a standalone basis, it stood at 2.38 tCO2/tcs.

Amidst the global push for environmental responsibility, steel companies are compelled to pursue decarbonisation as they grapple with the potential impact of cross-border carbon taxes on their industry.

Tata Steel is working on a long-term plan for decarbonisation, which primarily entails reducing emissions, carbon capture and utilisation (CCU), hydrogen-based steelmaking, increased share of renewable energy generation, and higher use of scrap to manufacture steel. But even as the company, like other steel makers, works on making the technology and cost viable, it looks at gas to fill the gap in the short term.

Rajiv Mangal, vice president of safety, health and sustainability, said, “In the furnace we use coke, and until hydrogen is available we are looking to use natural gas. Natural gas is today not available in Jamshedpur but it has reached east of India. We are in discussion with GAIL to see when they can bring natural gas to the doorsteps of Tata Steel.”

Sourcing Gas

The Tata Group steel manufacturer is talking to state-run GAIL for sourcing liquified natural gas (LNG) to replace 25-30 percent of diesel used by its Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) at its mines. Typically, LNG produces 20-30 percent less carbon dioxide (CO2) than diesel.

A query sent to GAIL remained unanswered.

“We have done experiments in Noamundi and West Bokaro. We had replaced diesel with LNG for two dump trucks; it requires a dual fuel kit in the trucks. Our experiment shows that we can run on 30 percent LNG and 70 percent diesel. Now we are sourcing dual kits for our entire fleet,” said DB Sundara Ramam, vice president, of raw materials.

The company has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Indian Oil Corporation Ltd to replace furnace oil and high-speed diesel with liquified petroleum gas (LPG) to reduce carbon footprint at its ferroalloy plants. It is currently not using LPG, and to begin with, it plans to start using it at its plants at Athagarh and Gopalpur in Odisha.

Hydrogen play in the works

Energy-intensive industries like steel are exploring hydrogen as a promising fuel to reduce emissions, yet they face significant challenges in terms of infrastructure and cost-effectiveness.

“We are exploring multiple ideas on this front. We are working with different hydrogen suppliers and technical partners to understand the best way of making hydrogen. We are contemplating on both the aspects – making or buying hydrogen,” Singh said.

In a report titled ‘Steel decarbonisation in India’ in September, Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) and JMK Research estimated that the steel industry will replace around 25-30 percent of its grey hydrogen requirements with green hydrogen in the early part of the 2030-2050 period. This will increase to 80 percent by 2050. The report highlighted that the cost of green hydrogen needs to be reduced and there is a need for a price penalty on carbon emissions for Indian steelmakers to switch to hydrogen-based steelmaking.

In April this year, Tata Steel undertook the trial injection of hydrogen gas using 40 percent of the injection systems in ‘E’ Blast Furnace at its Jamshedpur Works. The success of the trial has given the company insights into operating blast furnaces with greener fuel injectors to reduce fossil fuel consumption and cut down on CO2 emissions from the blast furnace.

“We are also working with a number of startups to understand the hydrogen play. Given we have been historically coal users, our focus is to increase our knowledge and expertise in the hydrogen space. We are engaging with the government to solicit support and make it viable for the larger ecosystem,” Singh said.

While the company engages with the Indian government for support, it met success in its UK operations on this front as the government there agreed to give a grant of £500 million to help the company decarbonise its Port Talbot project in Wales, after months of negotiations. Tata Steel will add £700 million of its own as it invests in cutting emissions.

The Challenge

Energy-intensive industries like steel are exploring hydrogen as a promising fuel to reduce emissions, yet they face significant challenges in terms of infrastructure and cost-effectiveness.

“Decarbonisation will be a costly affair for them (Tata Steel) – both in India and in the UK – given the current prices of alternative fuels. It’s not easy but there is societal pressure that will make them take small steps in that direction. They may have to change the pace of decarbonisation depending on trends in the cost of fuel versus that in the realisation of steel. In a good steel cycle, they may accelerate decarbonisation but in a low phase they may slow it down,” Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities.

There is added pressure to improve performance on account of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). To add to that, the European Union will start collecting carbon emission charges at its borders from the beginning of 2026; Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) initial phase was kickstarted on October 1. Steelmakers will have to move fast and Tata Steel knows that.

“Switching fuel may also need changes in operating assets/ technology. All this may take time. They are responsible corporate citizens but they are also responsible to the stakeholders so they will have to keep doing cost-benefit analysis at different stages,” Jasani said.

Fitch Ratings on October 9 upgraded Tata Steel Limited's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) from 'BB+' to 'BBB-'. Also, the rating agency has maintained a stable outlook in this context.

Additionally, the rating agency has upgraded the rating of $1 billion notes due in July 2024, which were issued by TSL's subsidiary, ABJA Investment Co. Pte. Ltd., and guaranteed by TSL, from 'BB+' to 'BBB-'.

The upgrade is a result of the revision in Tata Steel Limited's (TSL) Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) from 'bb' to 'bb+' due to reduced uncertainty and decreased financial risk associated with its UK operations.

Tata Steel's strategic shift towards replacing blast furnaces with more cost-effective and environmentally friendly electric arc furnace (EAF)-based steelmaking capacity is expected to enhance the cost competitiveness of its UK operations, the rating agency noted.

Fitch also said it's worth noting that Tata Steel's IDR enjoys a one-notch uplift due to the potential support it may receive from the Tata Group.

Fitch's decision to take these actions is based on the expectation of a substantial improvement in Tata Steel's profitability in the United Kingdom. According to Fitch, ""TSL's plan to install EAF-based steelmaking capacity of 3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) at Port Talbot, UK, within the next three-four years should allow the UK business to generate a profit even during industry downturns, instead of being a drag on TSL's financial performance.""

Regarding the rationale for the rating, Fitch said Tata Steel's Indian operations secure nearly all of their iron ore needs and and 22% of their coal requirements through the company's mines, and its plants in Kalinganagar and Jamshedpur are among the lowest-cost assets in the world.

It added, ""TSL's strong cost base in India grants it a significant competitive advantage amid volatile steel prices, underpinning its credit profile.""

Fitch also anticipates that Tata Steel's average annual capital expenditure (capex) for the period spanning FY24 to FY26 will be approximately 30% higher than the FY23 figure of Rs 141 billion.

The rating agency anticipates a surge in sales volumes for Tata Steel in FY25 and FY26. Specifically, it projects a 2% increase in consolidated sales volumes for FY24. It said, ""Volume growth in FY24 should be driven by the ramp-up of operations at Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited, which was acquired in FY23, to close to its 1mtpa capacity. We expect volume to jump by 6% in FY25 and 7% in FY26, driven by the Kalinganagar expansion.""

Three metal stocks, namely JSW Steel Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd and Hindalco Industries Ltd, received the highest upgrades in Moneycontrol's analyst tracker in September. These upgrades were fueled by Chinese government support measures and expected infrastructure spending and government initiatives ahead of key elections.

In September, JSW Steel received 9 buy ratings, 8 holds and 14 sell calls compared to 7 buys, 9 holds and 17 sell calls the previous year. Tata Steel has 24 buy ratings, 4 holds and 2 sell ratings, while last year it had 24 buys, 4 holds and 6 sell ratings. Hindalco Industries Ltd received 24 buy ratings and 1 hold rating, whereas last year it had 22 buy ratings, 1 hold rating and 1 sell rating.

In the last year, Hindalco Industries surged 24 percent, JSW Steel advanced 23 percent, while Tata Steel jumped nearly 29 percent. In the last month, both Hindalco and Tata Steel rose around 7 percent each while JSW Steel remained flat.

Metal firms are expected to experience a 6–7 percent growth due to increased infrastructure spending and government initiatives during an election year. Indian steel exports could rise, supported by higher Chinese domestic steel consumption and steady production. Steel spreads are anticipated to improve in the second quarter of FY24, thanks to lower coal costs, analysts said.

""Metal stocks are in high demand due to improved confidence in China's recovery. China has taken steps to boost auto and housing consumption, as well as private sector investment, including extending a 16-point reform plan for real estate and offering incentives like lower interest rates and down payments to stimulate home sales,"" said BoB Capital in its latest note.

Analysts anticipate steel margins to bounce back to mid-cycle levels by FY24, thanks to a gradual improvement in China's market balance that will ease pressure on steel prices and lower raw material costs. However, they don't foresee margins significantly exceeding mid-cycle levels due to China's structural surplus and weaker demand prospects in the US and Europe, which are expected to continue weighing on steel prices.

JSW Steel

Analysts are positive about JSW's strong volume growth potential in India, with its capacity set to increase from 27.7MT to 37MT due to ongoing projects. They believe JSW is well-positioned to benefit from India's structural volume growth. While JSW is one of the lowest-cost global steel converters, valuations may seem high for FY24.

Regarding margin outlook, with Chinese HRC export prices at $550/t and stable to higher margins expected for Indian companies, the weak Chinese domestic demand and increased Chinese steel exports over the past year are factors to consider.

Tata Steel Ltd

Recently, Tata Steel secured a 40% capex grant from the UK government to shift to a greener 3 million-ton Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) from a 3.5 million-ton Blast Furnace (BF), aligning with emission rules. They aim to retain 5,000 out of 8,000 jobs with union support, revealing costs in their Q2FY24 earnings call. This move is expected to save GBP 150-170 per ton, potentially reversing losses and improving competitiveness by shifting from the fourth quartile of the BF cost curve in Europe to the left half of the EAF cost curve.

Analysts foresee EBITDA potentially increasing from Rs 4600 crore (FY23) and a projected Rs 3600 crore (FY24) to a range of Rs 8800-9300 crore, assuming steady-state profitability of $125/t for the Netherlands. Valuations may rise with additional EBITDA, a 5.5x exit EBITDA multiple, net capex of GBP 0.75 billion, GBP 0.25 billion in restructuring costs, and a 4.5-year discounting period. However, the valuation is sensitive to achieving cost savings; at GBP 100/t, the potential benefit drops to Rs 2 per share from Rs 6-7 per share.

Hindalco Industries Ltd

Analysts anticipate that Hindalco's aluminium earnings will benefit in the short term due to declining coal costs. This improvement, combined with higher Novelis EBITDA per ton, is expected to boost earnings. While Novelis' EBITDA per ton is likely to improve in CY23, potential challenges in US demand may lead to margin volatility in FY24-25.

Hindalco's earnings are expected to accelerate from FY26 due to ongoing internally funded growth capex. However, analysts predict a wide trading range for the stock in the next 12-18 months, driven by macro factors such as LME aluminium prices and US consumer demand in autos and cans. Overall, analysts have a positive outlook for the stock's current levels, believing that the combination of improving Novelis earnings and steady to higher LME prices will support the stock price.

The availability of green hydrogen as a fuel will help reduce India’s dependence on coal for steel making, Tata Steel CEO and MD TV Narendran said on Tuesday. Narendran made the remark at the National Management Convention session of the All India Management Association (AIMA) here.

""The way steel is made is changing and will continue to change further, as the industry is putting up new plants… Availability of hydrogen as a fuel and reductive is the key to reducing dependence on coal,"" he said, adding that scrap will replace ore as the main input. In January 2023, the Union Cabinet approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore with an aim to make India a global hub for manufacturing this clean source of energy.

Tata Steel plans to scale up the usage of hydrogen in the steel-making process after the successful completion of the pilot project at its Jamshedpur plant in Jharkhand, said Narendran.",163,

Shares of Tata Steel Limited gained over 2 percent higher to Rs 130 in early trade on September 26 after Moody’s Investors Service revised the company's outlook to 'stable' and upgraded its long-term rating on the hope of an improvement in profits and its debt reduction efforts.

The steelmaker’s long-term rating was upgraded to 'Baa3' from 'Ba1', the rating agency said in a statement on September 25. ""The upgrade reflects our expectation of the continued strength in Tata Steel’s credit profile due to the company’s solid market position in India.""

""We expect the company's profitability to increase even as softer steel prices dent revenues,"" Kaustubh Chaubal, Moody's Senior Vice-President, said in a press release.

Moody's also said that its rating reflects the company's large-scale globally cost-competitive, vertically integrated steel operations in India.

The credit rating agency also noted that the new rating is attributed to the consistent growth of Tata Steel's European operations, along with the closure of unprofitable upstream operations in the UK. Additionally, it is influenced by the company's strong association with its parent organization, Tata Sons.

In June, Moody's had previously revised Tata Steel's outlook from 'stable' to 'positive' while simultaneously reaffirming its Ba1 corporate family rating (CFR).

In its rating rationale, Moody's emphasised that Tata Steel's robust presence in India, the world's second-largest steel market, will play a pivotal role in shaping the company's credit profile.

Moody's noted in its statement that the rating outlook underscores Tata Steel's ability to maintain resilient operations amid a challenging industry environment.

Rating agency Moody's Investors Service on September 25 assigned a Baa3 from Ba1 long-term issuer rating to Tata Steel and changed its outlook to ‘stable’ from ‘positive’.

""The upgrade reflects our expectation of the continued strength in Tata Steel's credit profile due to the company's solid market position in India. We expect the company's profitability to increase even as softer steel prices dent revenues,"" Kaustubh Chaubal, Moody's Senior Vice President, said in a press release.

Moody's said that its rating reflects the company's large-scale globally cost-competitive, vertically integrated steel operations in India.

The rating agency also said that the new rating is on account of the sustained improvement in Tata Steel's European operations, especially following the expected closure of the loss-making upstream operations in the United Kingdom and the company's close association with its parent, Tata Sons.

Moody's in June had revised the outlook on Tata Steel to ‘positive’ from ‘stable’. At the same time, Moody's also affirmed Tata Steel's Ba1 corporate family rating (CFR).

In its ratings rationale, Moody’s highlighted that the company's strong presence in the world's second-largest steel market, India, will be a key driver of the company's credit profile.

The rating firm said in its note that its rating outlook reflects Tata Steel's resilient operations amid a challenging industry environment.

It added that the structural improvement in Tata Steel's capital structure, with an absolute gross debt reduction and the substantial cash generated by the company during the last two fiscal years, has created a lasting buffer to the company's key credit metrics and liquidity, reducing the company's overall credit risk.

Moody’s said rising global interest rates to curb inflation and an increase in Indian steel export taxes have somewhat dampened steel prices. It also said its forecasts for Tata Steel are based on the rating agency's current price sensitivities for steel ($880 per ton for Tata Steel's Indian operations and $1,250/ton for Europe) for fiscal 2023.

Moody's has modeled per ton of metallurgical coal at $308 and iron ore at about $100. For fiscal 2024, it said its forecasts are based on the mid-point of its price sensitivity ranges ($600-$800/ton for steel, $80-$125 for iron ore and $110-$180 for metallurgical coal).

These price sensitivities translate into an EBITDA/ton assumption of $280 for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 for Tata Steel's Indian operations, a 30% decline over fiscal 2022, Moody’s Investors Service said in its note.

Moody's remains cautious in its forecasts and assumes that the business' EBITDA/ton will decline from $180 in fiscal 2022 to around $140 -$150 in fiscal 2023 and further slide to $40 -$50 in fiscal 2024.",465,0.4636321988972751

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel has announced a proposal to setup a 3mtpa Electric Arc Furnace at its Port Talbot steel making facility for capex of GBP 1.25bn. The proposed project will get GBP500mn grant (40% of the project cost) from UK government and adequate policy support for smooth transition to green steel making in UK at competitive landscape. While first stage of the process stands complete with this agreement, consultations with unions involved are expected to close in next three months. Capex is planned over next three years post successful consultation and subject to relevant regulatory approvals. We believe that the Tata Steel UK (TSUK) transition is EPS accretive given a) current cash losses will end, as company will import substrate instead of producing at old facilities, b) one-time cost will exist, but TSUK is expected to be in better situation than earlier case of recurring cash burn, c) volatility in coking coal prices won’t directly affect TSUK earnings, and d) likely fall in energy costs, as UK moves towards renewable sources.

Outlook

We revise our FY25E EBITDA estimates upwards by 5% to Rs411bn and introduce FY26E earnings estimates. Maintain ‘Buy’ at revised TP of Rs 144 (Rs 137 earlier) assigning EV/EBITDA multiple of 5x for FY25E EBITDA for TSE.

Brokerage views

Most brokerages have given a buy rating on Tata steel scrip.

CLSA: CLSA has assigned an ""Outperform"" rating to Tata Steel, with a raised target price of Rs 145 per share from Rs 125. According to CLSA, ""The company's recent agreement with the UK government to restructure its assets and implement structural changes in operations and cost management is seen as a positive development."" While the overhang has been removed, CLSA emphasises that the value accretion for investors will largely depend on the successful realisation of cost savings.

Jefferies: Jefferies is bullish on Tata Steel, giving a ""Buy"" rating with a target price of Rs 145 per share. Tata Steel's collaboration with the UK government, where it invests £750 million while the UK government invests £500 million, is expected to result in higher spreads compared to the existing setup. Furthermore, this investment is viewed as an opportunity to advance decarbonisation, but Jefferies also notes that it missed a chance to reduce exposure to high-cost, low-margin geographies.

Citi: Citi maintains a ""Buy"" rating for Tata Steel, with a target price of Rs 140 per share. ""The UK government's support for Tata Steel's EAF investment is seen as a positive step towards ensuring continuity, sustainability, and green operations,"" stated Citibank. However, Citi exercises caution, suggesting that it may be premature to gauge the full impact of this development until there is more clarity surrounding union consultations.

Morgan Stanley (MS): MS has given Tata Steel an ""Equal-weight"" rating, with a target price of Rs 119 per share. The joint investment in a 3 million tonnes EAF plant at Port Talbot, along with additional policy support from the UK government, including scrap availability, renewable energy sources, and support for green transition during the CBAM transitional phase, is seen as a beneficial move for the company's future prospects.

Is £500 million enough is the question

""In Wall Street, what has happened before will happen again. It must."" - Edwin Lefevre

“It is reluctant money that is driving stock prices higher,” Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities CEO Rahul Arora told Short Call. “My friends managing portfolios say cash is gushing in and they have no choice but to invest even when they know that valuations don’t make sense anymore. In a way, they are deploying the cash, even if reluctantly.”

This predicament of fund managers is not something new. It happens in every bull market. Maggie Mahar, author of the bestselling book, Bull: A History of the Boom, captures the mood in this excerpt from her book describing a situation in the late 90s when the dotcom-powered bull run was raging.

New portfolio managers had to contend with the avalanche of money landing at their doors. “Dozens of portfolio managers would tell me that when they opened the mail in the morning there would be another $100 million,” said George Kelly, a technology analyst at Morgan Stanley. “Their bylaws often mandated that they stay fully invested. They had to buy stocks and there was some urgency—there might be another $100 million dollars in the afternoon mail. Under the gun, they usually bought stocks that they knew, they already owned,” Kelly explained.

Tata Steel

The deal with the UK government for the subsidy for Port Talbot is finally sealed. Is £500 million enough is the question. While Tata Steel has more bulls than bears among analysts, those negative on the stock feel the size of the subsidy is not enough. Even some of the bulls don’t seem fully convinced. CLSA has raised its price target for the stock to Rs 145, and said that while the uncertainty over the deal has lifted, value accretion from the deal will depend on the cost savings as the company restructures the plant.

Siemens

The management said in an interview to CNBC-TV18 there could be some choppiness in ordering activity as election code of conduct kicks in shortly, though this will not affect routine order. It has said that margin would depend on commodity prices, and that some pressure is expected because of rising competition. On the positive side, it has said that capacity utilisation in the country has risen to 75 percent.

Capex boom

Siemen’s bullishness on capex is echoed by Jefferies Chris Wood in his latest GREED & Fear newsletter. Excerpts from the note.

“Annualised new private project announcements rose by 70 percent YoY to a record Rs 28 trillion in the four quarters ended 30 June. Meanwhile, the annualised gross fixed capital formation to GDP ratio has risen from a cyclical low in FY21 to a 15-quarter high of 29.2 percent in 1QFY24 ended 30 June.

All this means that a deleveraged private sector is poised to take up the baton, to use the relay analogy, in terms of driving an investment cycle after the heavy lifting done by the central government in recent years when most of the fiscal deficit has been driven by the big increase in central government’s capex on infrastructure.”

Festive treat

Nestle India boss Suresh Narayanan says there is a fair amount of

enthusiasm in market for the festive season, and expects his company to perform better than last year in the festive season. Food inflation is the only dampener for now, and premium products are growing faster than mass consumption products, he tells CNBC-TV18. Will that translate into added enthusiasm for the stock. After a 20 percent rally in the first six months of 2023, the stock has been digesting the gains over the last three months.

Texmaco Rail

The company’s board has approved fund raising up to Rs 1,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement. So far, the story about the railway sector in general has been about order wins. But as companies look to execute those massive orders, there will be lots of fund raising as well, and possible equity dilution. As stock prices race to new high, it will be hard for promoters to resist the temptation of raising funds, whatever the cause.

Windfall taxes

Traders who lost money in oil refining stocks like Chennai Petro and OIL India last year when the government suddenly announced windfall gains tax, can take some solace in knowing that India is the not the only market where such things happen.

France has ""questions"" about refining margins, and decisions could be made to curb excessive profits, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told journalists last week, reports Oilprice.com. Windfall taxes are one way France could help alleviate the pain of high prices for consumers, Le Maire said.

Global trade

Vincent Clerc CEO of shipping giant Maersk sees tentative signs of a recovery in global trade, but don’t bet on a boom yet.

“Barring any negative surprises, we would hope for a slow pickup as we get into 2024, a pickup that will not be a boom like what we have known in the past few years, but certainly ... a demand that is a bit more in line with what we see in terms of consumption, and not so much an inventory correction,” Clerc told CNBC’s Silvia Amaro.

Exit China

Global funds are retreating from Chinese stocks and bonds, diminishing the market’s clout in global portfolios and accelerating its decoupling from the rest of the world, reports Bloomberg. Foreign holdings of the nation’s equities and debt have fallen by about 1.37 trillion yuan ($188 billion), or 17 percent, from a December-2021 peak through the end of June this year, according to Bloomberg calculations based on the latest data from the central bank. That’s before onshore shares witnessed a record $12 billion outflow in August alone.

Iron ore surges

Spot iron ore prices have scaled a five-month high amid some supportive fundamentals in China, the world’s top buyer of the steel raw material, reports Reuters. When iron prices rise, so do steel prices. But hold your horses. Analysts feel the iron rally may be capped due to factors such as steel mills being forced to limit output to reduce winter pollution and keep to an unofficial policy that steel output should not grow this year.

Mining M&A

A recent rise in global mining M&A activity is set to continue over the coming years supported by consolidation and energy transition, Fitch Ratings said in a new report. Commodity prices may have eased this year, but they are still above mid-cycle levels, leaving miners with flush coffers. This should help miners flex their M&A muscles.

Holiday over

Student-loan payments resume October 1 after the pause in March 2020. Around 43 million borrowers will need to make payments averaging between $200 and $300 each month. Collectively that could divert up to $100 billion from Americans’ pockets over the coming year, leaving consumers squeezed and some of the nation’s largest retailers fearing a spending slowdown, reports WSJ.

Diamonds

Russia has so far managed to brave Western sanctions, but there are more coming, according to Reuters. The Group of Seven (G7) nations is aiming to reshape the global diamond supply chain by banning purchase of diamonds coming out Russia. This would fracture the global consumer diamond market in half as G7 countries would no longer be able to accept diamonds from Russia, the world's largest producer of rough diamonds.

Natural gas

Freeport LNG—the second largest liquefaction facility in the United States—is said to have returned to nearly full power on Friday after experiencing disruptions for the last week, reports oilprice.com. Meanwhile, the gas market in Europe remains volatile due to the extreme heat, gas plant maintenance, and Australia’s LNG strikes at Chevron’s Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities. Europe has surpassed its target for filling gas storage facilities to 90 percent capacity ahead of deadline, but a potential full stop of the remaining Russian pipeline gas to Europe on October 1 could keep gas prices choppy near time.",1339,0.00032140811284383136

The market went on a rally since the start of September and recorded nearly 5 percent gains so far. It hit a historic high and zoomed 1.9 percent last week. This is, therefore, the time for the market to see some retraction and some bearish divergence too, with price making higher highs, and momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) making lower highs on the daily charts. A similar situation is seen on the weekly charts as well.

The Nifty50 may see some consolidation and correction, taking support at the 20,000-19,900 area, whereas a rebound after the possible correction may take the index towards 20,500 mark, experts said.

The index jumped 372 points last week to 20,192 points and formed a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with above-average volumes for the third straight week.

""Indicators have entered the overbought zone, and the daily chart displays small-body candles, suggesting some signs of fatigue among the bulls,"" Sameet Chavan, research head for technical and derivatives at Angel One, said.

He feels that the next leg of up-move may not be as swift as recent times, potentially involving in-between pauses or price corrections. The overall sentiment remains positive, and the advisable approach is to view dips as buying opportunities, he said.

In this scenario, he feels the previous resistance of around 20,000 is likely to act as an immediate support, while Tuesday's panic low of 19,900 remains a critical pivot point. On the other hand, in the uncharted territory, the next resistance zone lies in the 20,400-20,500 range.

In the coming sessions, Jigar Patel, senior manager for equity research at Anand Rathi, also feels that 20,400 might act as an immediate hurdle for the Nifty50 since that is the placement of a rising trendline. On the downside, 20,000–19,000 now might be a decisive support for the short term.

Since the broader markets are overstretched, failing to clear the high might trigger some profit-booking. Thus, he advised traders to remain extremely stock-specific and follow strict stop-losses.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas from experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the September 8 closing prices.

Expert: Viraj Vyas, CMT, Technical & Derivatives Analyst - Institutional Equity at Ashika Stock Broking

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,601 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,520 | Target: Rs 1,800 | Return: 12.4 percent

This stock stands out as one of the top performers in the auto sector, which has experienced a significant and robust upward trend from April 2023 to July 2023. During this period, the stock surged from Rs 1,100 levels to Rs 1,600 levels.

Subsequently, the stock transitioned into a consolidation phase, forming what appears to be an Ascending Triangle pattern. It's worth noting that this pattern is typically considered bullish in nature. A potential breakout above the Rs 1,605-1,610 levels is anticipated to initiate the next leg of its upward move.

Union Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 96 | Stop-Loss: Rs 86 | Target: Rs 120 | Return: 25 percent

Among the banking sector, particularly in PSU banking stocks, there has been a notable surge in momentum in recent weeks. Many of these stocks, including Union Bank, had been consolidating for an extended period. In the case of Union Bank, the stock had been in consolidation mode from 2019 until around 2023. This consolidation phase has taken the form of a Cup and Handle pattern, which is typically indicative of accumulation and a potential bottoming out process.

Notably, in the previous week, there was a significant increase in trading volumes, suggesting that the stock is poised to break above its resistance area and potentially initiate a strong upward move, targeting Rs 120-125 zone.

Coforge: Buy | LTP: Rs 5,619 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,350 | Target: Rs 6,300 | Return: 12 percent

The stock has exhibited robust performance over the past few weeks, capitalizing on the strong performance of Nifty IT stocks, even as the broader market approaches the end of a two-year corrective phase. During its ascent, the stock has been shaping a rounding pattern, and it recently achieved a breakout above the golden ratio of a prior downward move (Rs 4,500-3,250).

Maintaining levels above Rs 5,350 indicates a favourable outlook for the ongoing upward trend, and the stock is poised to target Rs 6,200-6,300 range. While a minor obstacle may be encountered around Rs 6,000 levels, the overall trajectory remains promising.

Expert: Vinay Rajani, CMT, senior technical & derivative analyst at HDFC Securities

Canara Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 365 | Stop-Loss: Rs 350 | Target: Rs 399 | Return: 9 percent

The stock price has broken out from downward sloping trendline on the monthly chart. Price breakout is accompanied with a jump in volumes. Stock price is trading above its 20, 50 and 200 DMA, indicating bullish trend on all time frame.

Indicators and oscillators like MACD (moving average convergence divergence) and RSI (relative strength index) have turned bullish on the monthly charts. Nifty PSU Bank index has broken out from the consolidation.

UPL: Buy | LTP: Rs 634.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 602 | Targets: Rs 680-720 | Return: 13 percent

The stock price has broken out from bullish Inverted Head and Shoulder pattern on the daily chart. Stock has surpassed the crucial resistance of 5-day EMA (exponential moving average). Price breakout is accompanied with jump in volumes. Indicators and oscillators have turned bullish on the daily charts. Chemical sector has started outperforming for last two weeks.

Triveni Turbine: Buy | LTP: Rs 433.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 410 | Targets: Rs 480-520 | Return: 20 percent

The stock price has broken out from the multi-week consolidation. Price breakout is accompanied by jump in volumes. Stock is trading above all important moving averages, which indicates bullish trend on all time frames. Stock price has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on weekly charts.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, head of research (retail) at Kotak Securities

Zydus Lifesciences: Buy | LTP: Rs 645 | Stop-Loss: Rs 620 | Targets: Rs 675-700 | Return: 8.5 percent

The stock market is currently displaying a bullish trend and is trading above all significant averages. Furthermore, it has formed a Flag formation that suggests the bullish trend would persist.

Therefore, it is anticipated that the stock could increase to Rs 675, which was the previous all-time high. In an optimal scenario, it may even reach Rs 700 if it surpasses the previous high. If you wish to take a long position in the stock, it is advisable to set a stop loss at Rs 620.

DCW: Buy | LTP: Rs 58.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 53 | Targets: Rs 66-75 | Return: 28 percent

The stock is breaking out of a multi-year resistance level and has formed a symmetrical triangle on the long-term charts. Recently, the stock closed below the upper boundary of the triangle formation. However, we believe that it is now ready to move towards the target based on the triangle pattern.

According to the triangle formation, the stock may reach upward levels of Rs 66, Rs 75, and Rs 90 in the medium to long term. We suggest buying at the present level and placing a stop loss at Rs 53 to minimize potential losses.

Tata Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 132 | Stop-Loss: Rs 126 | Targets: Rs 140-145 | Return: 10 percent

The sector is a bright spot in the current economic climate, playing a significant role in the overall growth. Tata Steel, in particular, stands out with exceptional performance in the same category.

Notably, it formed a continuation high before breaking out of a trading range of Rs 133 last Thursday. Based on technical analysis, the next levels to watch for are Rs 140 and Rs 145, respectively. It is advisable to consider buying at current levels, with a stop loss set at Rs 126.

Expert: Mitesh Karwa, research analyst at Bonanza Portfolio

ICICI Prudential Life Insurance: Buy | LTP: Rs 595 | Stop-Loss: 560 | Target: Rs 654 | Return: 10 percent

Bandhan Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 249 | Stop-Loss: Rs 235 | Target: Rs 270 | Return: 8 percent

Bandhan Bank has seen breaking out of a downwards sloping resistance trendline on the weekly timeframe with above average volumes and a bullish candlestick after bouncing back from important support zones. Adding to it the stock is trading above important EMAs of 20/50/100/200 on the daily timeframe which indicates strength.

Tata Steel will restructure its balance sheet to reflect the current cash losses in the UK operations, and non-cash impairment of legacy assets, the company said after announcing the much awaited agreement with the UK government for its Port Talbot site. Legacy assets are those that have become obsolete or lost nearly all their initial value.

On September 15, Tata Steel and the UK government jointly announced the agreement to invest in state-of-the-art electric arc furnace steelmaking at the Port Talbot site at a cost of GBP 1.25 billion, including a government grant of GBP 500 million.

Speaking to analysts over a conference call after announcing the agreement, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer Koushik Chatterjee said that there would be a cash outflow from Tata Steel’s balance sheet, but declined to quantify it.

“Based on the transition plan, there will be a cash outflow, it will depend on how we look at the transition and the restructuring. But whether it will be significant or not, depends on where we stand,” Chatterjee said.

Tata Steel and the UK government agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and finalisation of detailed terms and conditions.

The CFO said the company will be able to share specifics regarding the scope, nature, and timing of the restructuring after the financial results of the second quarter of 2023-24.

Tata Steel will finance its share of the investment, about GBP 700 million, through internal equity.

Focus on cash flow

Tata Steel will remain focused on managing the consolidated cash flow of the company in a manner that prioritises growth in India and also pursues the decarbonisation aspirations of its subsidiaries in the UK and Netherlands, the company’s management said in the call.

“Tata Steel’s financial outlook will improve on account of the elimination of steady cash losses once the transition happens, and the ongoing parental support for the UK business,” said Chatterjee.

Tata Steel’s gross debt stood at Rs 75,561 crore at the end of fiscal 2021-22 after the company repaid debt of Rs 15,232 crore during the year.

At Tata Steel’s 115th Annual General Meeting on June 28, Chairman N Chandrasekaran told shareholders that the company will continue to reduce debt by around $1 billion a year, but does not aim to reduce it to zero given its expansion plans.

“In India, we remain on track to nearly double our steelmaking capacity to 40 million tonnes. As you're aware, we continue to prioritise the completion of the 5 million tonne capacity expansion in Kalinganagar,” Chatterjee said, reiterating the company’s India expansion plan after the UK agreement.

In an interview to Moneycontrol on July 31, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer TV Narendran said that driven by demand in India, the company will spend Rs 16,000 crore on capex in FY23-24.",498,0.3409220576286316

(Image source: X)

The UK government has announced a £500 million package for Tata Steel to facilitate the switch to green energy at the country's biggest Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales.

The announcement has been one of the most crucial and anticipated decisions of the Rishi Sunak administration. This critical issue was waiting to be resolved since Boris Johnson was the prime minister followed by the brief premiership of Liz Truss after which Sunak took over in October 2022. However, the announcement has also allowed the Labour government to attack the Tory government led by Sunak.

The Tata group had maintained that if no aid was received from the government, they would be forced to shut down the plant, leading to thousands of job losses. The conglomerate and the UK government have been conducting negotiations for more than two years after the group made it clear that the government would have to provide subsidies for the expensive switchover to green energy. The Tata group is expected to invest over £700 million to match the required sum of £1.25 billion to get rid of the two coal-powered blast furnaces.

The announcement provides a boost to the UK's fledgling steel sector which has for decades cried over the government's alleged indifference. However, the deal has not been welcomed by unions who fear that 3,000 workers could lose their jobs. Gary Smith, general secretary of the GMB union, has said: ""This deal will have devastating consequences for jobs and workers. It will rip the heart out of the Port Talbot community. Our country cannot be secure without a functioning domestic steel industry, and workers must be at the heart of plans to modernize it. Once again, we see how so-called transitions are anything but fair or just for working people.""

The demand for financial aid from the UK government was made as countries ramp up efforts to meet climate objectives, which meant changing over to expensive greener fuels in carbon-intensive industries like steel. Several European countries have already announced substantial aid to steel companies to help in the transition, and Britain was seen as a laggard. While the negotiations between the Tata group and the UK government had their fair share of ups and downs, there were instances when the company made it clear that it would exit the steel sector in the absence of any package from the government. In fact, the issue of state aid to Tata Steel was identified as one of the key decisions Rishi Sunak's administration had to make when he replaced Liz Truss as the UK's prime minister last year.

""The agreement with the UK government is a defining moment for the future of the steel industry. The proposed investment will preserve significant employment and represents a great opportunity for the development of a green technology-based industrial ecosystem in south Wales,"" said Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Tata group chairman.

Cries of job loss

But not all stakeholders are excited about the announcement. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP whose constituency of Aberavon includes Port Talbot, feels that instead of focusing on electric arc furnaces, the option of hydrogen fuel should have been explored, which would have meant that the plant could have continued to produce all the qualities and grades of steel, thus ensuring that there were no job losses.

""The Government's decarbonisation strategy should build for the future whilst also protecting the current order book. This new government plan looks likely to fall short on both fronts. Labour's £3 billion steel renewal fund will meet these challenges because it is driven by long-term thinking, as opposed to the sticking-plaster approach preferred by the Conservatives,"" he wrote in a column for The Mirror after the announcement.

Kinnock, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Steel, has on earlier occasions told me that the Tory government has allowed the crucial steel industry to suffer due to underinvestment and neglect. Just before Rishi Sunak left for India to take part in the G20 summit, Kinnock had raised the issue of the steel sector during the prime minister's questions on Wednesday, September 6.

In a statement, Sunak's spokesperson said: ""We recognise that this will have been an anxious time for employees and their families while this work to find the right way forward has taken place for those that are affected. We are working with the Welsh government and with Tata Steel to establish a dedicated transition board which supports employees and the economy affected, worth up to £100 million in total. And there are significant opportunities for people in the area, including the new Celtic free port which is due to create 16,000 jobs. But it is important to note that simply maintaining blast furnaces production, i.e., the status quo, was not an option with the steel industry needing a sustainable future using more modern technology and practices.""

The announcement of this £500 million package is part of the wider attempt by the UK government to ensure that companies stay in Britain. Several European countries, and more significantly the US, have announced tax credits for green businesses to attract companies and investments.

Tata Steel and UK - a long history

Tata Steel and the British government have a long relationship that goes back over a century to colonial times. In 1899, when Lord Curzon came to India as the viceroy, he introduced reforms in the mining rules and invited investments from English capitalists, which did not lead to much progress. Lord Curzon then turned to the Tata group which had been trying to enter the steel and iron sector since the 1880s. He facilitated the entry of the group into the sector by promising to buy large quantities of steel rails and by agreeing to build a railway line from the mines to the proposed plants.

However, Lord Curzon's support must be seen in the context of decreasing imports of UK steel in India. In the late 1960s, economist Amartya Sen pointed out that Lord Curzon's encouragement to the Tatas came at a time when Belgium had overtaken the UK as the biggest exporter of steel to India, and hence the establishment of an indigenous steel industry posed less of a challenge to steel manufacturers in England. However, when the Tatas attempted to raise capital in England for the venture, they failed spectacularly. English capitalists were not interested in investing in an Indian steel company, after which they decided to raise the capital in India. In just under a month the Tatas managed to raise £1,630,000 and floated the company in India riding on the Swadeshi credo.

During the two world wars, the Tatas provided steel and iron that bolstered Britain’s war efforts. In current times, the group is seen as a major investor and employer in Britain through its presence in software, automobile, hospitality and steel sectors.

The announcement (on Friday, 15 September) of the state package to Tata Steel is only appropriate, as the company manufactures around 50 percent of the UK's total steel production. One hopes that it is not an instance of too little, too late as the opposition Labour party would like the British public to believe.",1226,-0.10050101171840321

The UK government has agreed to give a grant of £500 million to help Tata Steel decarbonise its Port Talbot project at Wales, after months of negotiations to save the project, the company said in a statement.

Tata Steel and the UK government jointly announced the agreement to invest in state-of-the-art Electric Arc Furnace steelmaking at the Port Talbot site with a capital cost of £1.25 billion, which will include the government grant of £500 million. Tata Steel had sought a more substantial sum from the government to support the project during early negotiations.

On the deal, Tata Group Chairman N Chandrasekaran said, “The agreement with the UK Government is a defining moment for the future of the steel industry and indeed the industrial value chain in the UK…The proposed investment will preserve significant employment and presents a great opportunity for the development of a green technology-based industrial ecosystem in South Wales.”

Tata Steel said that the project remains subject to all relevant information and consultation processes before decisions are made. Subject to informing and consulting, it is proposed that this new investment project could be operational within 36 months of the receipt of relevant regulatory and planning approvals.

“Tata Steel UK has been facing significant challenges due to the heavy end facilities approaching their end of life. The proposed project, with one of the largest investments in the UK Steel Industry in recent decades, provides an opportunity for an optimal outcome for all stakeholders. We will undertake a meaningful consultation with the Unions on the proposed transition pathway in the context of future risk and opportunities for Tata Steel UK,” Tata Steel’s Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, T V Narendran said.

In a conference call with analysts, the management of Tata Steel said that besides the grant, the UK government will also help the project on the policy front, especially to manage energy and infrastructure for the project.

In response to a question on the internal rate of return (IRR) or return on capital (RoC) in the long run on the planned investment in Port Talbot, Chatterjee said, “Due diligence is going on. I think it's safe to say that it will certainly meet our cost of capital. The total project, on a steady state basis, over its useful life, should be more than the cost of capital and should be in the region of 15-16 percent.”

Meanwhile British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also announced the deal on X, formerly Twitter, saying that this will ""protect thousands of skilled jobs in the long-term and help grow the economy.""

Currently, Port Talbot employs around 4,000 individuals, which represents half of Tata Steel's workforce in the UK. The company had earlier said that even with government financial support, it may have to cut as many as 3,000 jobs at the site.

The Guardian reported on September 13 that the union leaders have expressed anger at being shut out of discussions between the UK government and Tata Steel that could lead to substantial job losses at two of Britain’s four remaining blast furnaces.

The Port Talbot steelworks has two blast furnaces that operate around the clock to manufacture steel for various industries. The site is among the largest polluters in the country. The decarbonisation project would bolster UK’s steel security and would be the first major step towards decarbonisation of the local steel industry, reducing direct emissions by 50 million tonnes over a decade, Tata Steel said.

Tata Steel said that the proposed project would also involve Tata Steel’s balance sheet being restructured with potential elimination of the current cash losses in the UK operations and non-cash impairment of legacy investments. During the transition period and project phase, Tata Steel UK would work intensively to ensure uninterrupted and reliable supply of products to fulfill customer and market commitments including through import of additional steel substrate from stable supply chains to feed its downstream units.

In an interview to Moneycontrol on July 31, Narendran had said, “The UK business tends to make money when steel prices are good, if not, it tends to have a negative EBITDA. That’s always been the challenge with UK business. Over the years, we have shrunk the UK business from 10 million tonnes to 3 million tonnes and the India business has grown to 20 million tonnes. So, while UK business was 40 percent of our business at one time, it is now 10 percent of our business.”

Separately, the Tata Sons steelmaker also announced that it would invest approximately £20 million over the next four years to set up two additional Centers of Innovation & Technology in the UK at the Henry Royce Institute at Manchester (for advanced materials research) and at Imperial College London (for research in Sustainable Design & Manufacturing).

The stock is not too far from the record high of Rs 153 seen in August 2021, thanks to rising interest from high net-worth individuals as well as institutional investors of late. There is, however, a contrarian view from Investec. It feels onetime subsidy from the UK government will not help the company’s European operations, and that it may need subsidies on a sustained basis. Investec also sees the huge debt on the company’s book as a cause for concern and expects it to halt its capex programmes to reduce the pressure on balance sheet. Investec has a reduce rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 82.

Chennai Petroleum

There was a 9 percent rally in the stock on Friday as investors’ fondness for refining stocks persisted. Globally, the refining capacity is stretched due to under-investment, and shutdowns happening more frequently. The previous rally in Indian refining stocks last year ended abruptly when the government imposed windfall tax on oil explorers and refiners. Valuation is not so much the risk when it comes to refining stocks, as much as policy changes are.

The stock is on the NSE F&O ban list, after seeing heavy volumes over the past few weeks. Sugar stocks across the board have had a good run lately on reports of a deficit in global markets. Like oil companies, sugar is highly vulnerable to sudden policy changes. Two key triggers for the sector will be the government’s stance on exports and the changes to State Advised Prices for sugarcane in an election year. In June, the Haryana government announced a Rs 10 per quintal hike in SAP of sugarcane to Rs 372 for the 2022-23 season, giving in to pressure from the farmer lobby.

Till recently, the widely held view was that its internet ticketing revenues was unlikely to grow much faster than what it is right now. As veteran investors say, when a company is a monopoly, the downside risk increases. IRCTC’s profits have been rangebound for the last five quarters now. Further gains will depend on the market’s willingness to pay a higher multiple for the same rate of earnings growth.

China will make it easier for insurance companies to invest in domestic stocks, the latest in a series of measures aimed at shoring up market sentiment, reports Bloomberg. A lower risk weighting frees up more capital for insurers to invest. Risk weighting have also been cut for investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which in China channel money mainly into infrastructure projects. It also set a relatively low risk weighting for private equity investments in China's strategic and emerging sectors.

Some respite

China’s consumer prices returned to positive territory in August, rising 0.1 percent, while factory-gate price declines slowed, as deflation pressures ease amid signs of stabilization in the economy, reports Reuters. But analysts say more policy support is needed to shore up consumer demand in the world’s second-biggest economy, with a labor market recovery slowing and household income expectations uncertain.

Austerity over stimulus

Despite advice from leading Chinese economists to take bolder action, senior Chinese officials have been unable to roll out major stimulus or make significant policy changes because they don’t have the green signal from President Xi Jinping, reports WSJ.

The top leader has shown few signs of worry over the outlook despite the gathering gloom and hasn’t seemed interested in backing more stimulus, according to the people and publicized remarks by Xi, the report said. The top leader’s apparent reluctance to embrace such moves, which people familiar with the matter say is partly rooted in his ideological preference for austerity.

Tata Steel and ABB India have entered into an agreement to explore technology that could help reduce carbon footprint in steel production, according to a BSE filing.

The two companies will focus on system-level assessments of Tata Steel’s manufacturing plants and production facilities to evaluate and co-develop short-term and long-term options for energy efficiency, decarbonisation, and circularity, the filing said.

Tata Steel and ABB will explore energy optimisation through hydrogen as an alternative fuel for upstream processes and energy reduction as well as substitution through fully integrated electrification and digital systems such as ABB Ability eMine and e-Mobility solutions and energy-efficient motors.

“Steel companies know there are opportunities to improve their processes, and Tata Steel is one of the leaders in this movement towards energy efficiency and reduction of carbon footprint,” Vipul Gautam, Group Vice-President, Global Account Executive for Tata Group, ABB, said in the filing.

“World Economic Forum figures anticipate the energy transition will require as much as 3 billion tonnes of metals over the medium term; six times more mineral inputs by 2040 to reach net-zero emissions globally by 2050. ABB is confident in working with our customers and partners to evolve how steelmaking is powered to help reach production and environmental targets,” he was quoted as saying.

Tata Steel has an annual crude steel capacity of 35 million tonnes and this collaboration could see that increase to 40 million tonnes by 2030.

The steel giant said that it is committed to major sustainability targets, including achievement of carbon neutrality by 2045. It has a medium-term target to reduce carbon emissions to less than 2 tonnes of CO₂ per tonne of crude steel in its Indian operations by 2025.

The Indian steel major has been in long-drawn discussions related to the critical green transition of the UK's largest steelworks, involving thousands of jobs in the country's steel industry.

According to a ""Sky News"" report on Saturday, both sides are now close to agreeing a deal that would commit millions to the future of the Port Talbot steelworks.

""Tata Steel is continuing to discuss with the UK government a framework for continuity and decarbonisation of steel making in the UK amidst very challenging underlying business conditions given that several of its heavy end assets are approaching end of life,"" a Tata Steel spokesperson told PTI, when asked about the development.

""Given the financially constrained position of our UK business, any significant change is only possible with government investment and support, as also seen in other steel making countries in Europe where governments are actively supporting companies in de-carbonisation initiatives,"" the spokesperson said.

According to UK media reports, the draft plans close to being finalised include the UK government committing around GBP 500 million of funding and the Tata Group agreeing GBP 700 million of capital expenditure to help pay for a switch away from polluting coal-fired blast furnaces. The Indian steel major would reportedly commit to building electric arc furnaces, which offer greener, less labour-intensive ways of producing steel than traditional blast furnaces.

Later in the day, Tata Steel issued a clarification on the reports and said that discussions with the UK government and other relevant stakeholders are ongoing.

Opposition Labour's Stephen Kinnock, the local MP for Aberavon which covers Port Talbot, stressed that unions ""must be fully involved and workforce must support the plan"".

""Steel is a strategic industry that underpins our entire economy. It provides tens of thousands of highly skilled jobs, it's vital for our national security, and it's key to achieving net zero. Failure to invest in our steel industry would be the very definition of a false economy,"" he tweeted.

The unions, meanwhile, have expressed concerns over reports that a few thousand job losses are expected as part of the negotiations at the Tata-owned Port Talbot steelworks, which employs around 4,000 workers.

""We continue to support a solution that will maintain blast furnace production and safeguard the future for all the UK plants. We are ready to use all means at our disposal to protect jobs and our vital strategic industry,"" said the Community steelworkers union.

The UK government has not commented on the latest reports, but any support package is expected to be dependent on pledges of investment into the future from the Indian steel giant.",470,-0.6227446794509888

The British government is in advanced talks with Tata Steel, the country's biggest steel producer, to provide $629 million of funding to help secure the long-term future of a key part of its steel industry, Sky News reported on September 2.

The funding would be pumped into the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales alongside $881 million from Tata Steel's Indian parent company and a commitment from the company to build electric arc furnaces, Sky News said.

British officials have been talking to the country's two biggest steelmakers, Tata and British Steel, for months about state support to help fund the transition to the more environmentally-friendly method of producing steel from electric arc furnaces.

But the talks have faced difficulties over potential job losses because the new style furnaces require fewer staff.

About 8,000 people are employed by Tata Steel in Britain and Sky News cited industry sources as saying the company had warned that it may need to make as many as 3,000 redundancies in the future.

Tata Steel has in the past warned that without government support, it will need to consider closing its sites.

There is ""no silver bullet"" for green transition in hard-to-abate sectors, including steel, Tata Steel global CEO & MD T V Narendran said on August 26, noting it's a complex challenge and needs government support.

The statement from the industry leader comes amid growing concerns across economies over emissions, and need to increase usage of green energy.

Steel is the most commonly used metal in the world and one cannot do without steel. Even for the transition, steel will be needed whether to hold solar panels up, windmills, storage and pipelines, he said addressing a session at B20 Summit India 2023.

""You need to find a solution and there is no silver bullet for that…India is alone going to add 100-150 million tonne steel capacity every decade…for the next few decades you will have these hard-to-abate sectors growing, cement production is twice the amount of steel production globally…you need to find solutions which are technical, which don't get solved by just finding another energy source,"" he said.

Supply chain in steel sector has been built over 100 years, so transitioning from coal to gas to hydrogen even from supply chain point is a very complex challenge, Narendran, who is also the chairman of Manufacturing Council of industry body CII said.

""This journey is going to be significant and we should not underestimate that the industry can support part of the cost… cost of transition so needs government support. You need customers to be willing to pay more for green products..it's a long journey and I think journey has started in Europe and the US,"" he said.

In India also, very aggressive renewable energy targets have been set where a lot needs to be done because majority of increasing steel capacity in the world is going to come up in India ""and we need to transition to greener process routes."" He further said steel accounts about 8 per cent of the carbon footprint in the world as the industry is growing, particularly in the emerging markets.

The transition can happen only if there is a policy framework to support it and carbon markets which are there in Europe.

Speaking on his company operations in the Netherlands, Narendran said the business there is moving from coal to gas to hydrogen and the transition is important for that nation because Tata Steel Netherlands will become one of the biggest consumers of hydrogen there.

Tata Steel – which is in an expansion mode in India – is not so keen on any other new acquisitions, the company CEO T V Narendran has said.

The statement from Narendran has come amid Vedanta Ltd reviewing and evaluating its steel and steel-making raw materials businesses.

In June, Vedanta Ltd said it will immediately begin the review and evaluate a broad range of options including potential strategic sale of some or all of its steel businesses.

""Not so keen on any other new acquisitions… We don't need it,"" Narendran said in a reply to a question on his company's interest in buying Vedanta Ltd's steel business.

There is a lot to do at Tata Steel's existing sites, he added.

The company has a plan to scale up its annual installed steel making capacity to 40 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) by 2030 in India, from around 22 MTPA at present.

In June 2018, Vedanta Limited acquired Jharkhand-based steel company ESL Steel Limited through an insolvency resolution process.

The company set up a green field integrated manufacturing facility, which is currently commissioned at a capacity of 2.5 MT per annum.

Speaking on Tata Steel UK operations, Narendran, who is also the MD of the company, said ""we are (still) engaged with the UK government to find a solution. If we can find a common ground with the government (there)."" There is no problem in the UK. The production is not affected. The only challenge is the upstream assets are old and reliability of the equipment is sometimes not so great, he said.

India-headquartered Tata Steel owns the UK's largest steelworks at Port Talbot in South Wales and employs around 8,000 people across all its operations in the country.

The company had sought 1.5 billion pounds from the UK government to execute its decarbonisation plans.

The first two quarters have been more challenging than expected for Tata Steel, but the company is not giving up its target of reducing debt by $1 billion in fiscal year 2023-24, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer TV Narendran told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview.

The Tata group steekmaker’s net profit plummeted 93% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023-24, dragged by its Europe business, which reported negative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) for the third consecutive quarter.

Narendran reiterated that the company will spend Rs 16,000 crore on capex in FY24, driven by India demand.

Excerpts from the interview follow:

Tata Steel’s consolidated net profit plummeted 93% in the first quarter of 2023-24. Many brokerages had expected you may report a loss in the quarter and may have been surprised by the improvement in realisation.

What was behind the Q1 numbers?

The expectation was that we will report a loss because we had guided that we will be completing the transaction on the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) and will have to recognise some losses on that account. That’s where the analysts had assumed that we would be negative, but we had some positives as well. The performance, particularly in India, has been reasonably good despite the challenging environment. So, even after you take out the one offs, we have delivered numbers that are better than what people had expected. The volumes have been strong in India. The weakness in prices internationally is reflected in the pricing in India as well. In Europe, we have had some challenges. We had guided that the blast furnace in the Netherlands was down for relining; only one of the two blast furnaces were operational for six months. Our numbers are significantly lower than last year because last year Q1 was a period when steel prices were quite high and coal prices were not yet that high. What we were consuming was not high-cost coal. It was also the quarter when the export duty was brought in by India. There were abnormal circumstances in Q1 of last year, so it may not be a good base for comparison. This is the third consecutive quarter of losses in Europe operations. There are macro factors affecting the demand there and you have undertaken relining of blast furnaces in the Netherlands, which is affecting production.

How is this looking for the rest of the year?

We give European numbers on a consolidated basis. But if you look at our performance for the last 8-10 years, typically, the Netherlands business is positive in cash, EBITDA and PAT (profit after tax). It is a pretty strong business. The UK is where we have struggled because structurally there are some challenges. The assets are old and coming to the end of life. Often, the Netherlands business offset the losses in the UK business. On a consolidated basis, you tend to see a positive EBITDA more often than not. But last year, because of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, gas prices and electricity prices in Europe shot up significantly in a short period. Secondly, the demand recovery was taking time because of the overhang of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It was a pretty tough year in Europe. On top of that, we had the blast furnace relining so the Netherlands business has not been able to contribute on a consolidated basis and in fact has negative EBITDA in Q1, which is very unusual. That’s why you see three quarters in a row, Europe operations had negative EBITDA.

The challenge will continue for Q2 as well because the blast furnace is still being relined; it is a five- to six-month process. We will see a positive recovery in the performance of the Netherlands only from Q3; by Q4 it will be back to normal.

The UK business tends to make money when steel prices are good, if not, it tends to have a negative EBITDA. That’s always been the challenge with the UK business. Over the years, we have shrunk the UK business from 10 million tonnes to 3 million tonnes and the India business has grown to 20 million tonnes. So, while UK business was 40 percent of our business at one time, it is now 10 percent of our business. That’s why Tata Steel, on a consolidated basis, is in a much stronger place. Going forward, the Netherlands business will come back to normal and will hopefully be able to offset the UK, which will swing between positive and negative EBITDA.

What’s the outlook for demand?

India demand continues to be okay, driven by a strong auto industry. Construction demand in Q2 tends to be a bit soft as construction activities slow down in the monsoon season. Overall, in India, the demand is quite strong, which is reflected in the fact that we are running at 100 percent capacity utilisation and selling 95 percent of that in India. Globally, demand is going to be driven a lot by what happens in China. The recovery in China has not been as great as expected. The stimulus that has been given so far, which is going to the real estate sector, is more to spend on completing projects than starting new projects. Though I see that in the last couple of days, there has been a little bit more excitement about another stimulus coming to the real estate sector in China.

Europe will slowly recover. Next year will be better than this year from a macroeconomic point of view. In Europe and in the US, inflation is still on the higher side. The Fed, the European Central Bank, the UK Central Bank — there are talks of more rate hikes. I think it will be next year before you really see economic activity come back strongly in Europe. But we are positive about India. That’s where most of our growth is going to come from.

What’s the outlook for price and realisation in the second quarter and for the rest of the fiscal year?

We have guided that Q2 realisations in both Europe and India will be lower than Q1. In India, it will be about ₹3,100 per tonne lower in Q2 than Q1. In Europe, we are expecting it to be about €38 pounds per tonne lower in Q2 than Q1.

At the same time, we expect the costs of coking coal consumption to come down by at least $50-55 in both Europe and India. To some extent the drop in prices will be offset by the drop in coking coal costs. We are looking at some other costs to try and protect margins.

So to that extent, what kind of EBITDA per tonne are you expecting for your consolidated operations and your India operations, if you can give some colour on that for the second quarter?

We don’t give specific guidance on EBITDA; there are many other moving parts. We expect H2 to be much stronger than H1 for multiple reasons. We expect that China exports will reduce in H2, which will bring more stability to international steel prices. The India demand post monsoons should be strong, leading up to the elections. Europe will progressively start getting better. Inflation is slowly coming under control. Globally, interest rate hikes will stop. So, overall, we expect a better H2 than H1 for sure.

You have been talking to the UK government for support for your plant there. Now there are some reports suggesting you are internally looking at an exit plan. Where do you stand vis-à-vis the conversations with the UK government? Because they are happening at the very top level... Is there an exit plan or are there other options?

The conversations have been going on for some time as you said, but we must also consider the fact that we have had three governments in the UK in the last two years and there was a lack of the political stability needed to take these calls. But now, we are seeing clear progress. Dedicated teams are working on it with us. We want to take it to its logical conclusion, which we hope will be acceptable to all stakeholders. All other speculation is very hypothetical.

Have you set a hard stop for the timeline because the process has been going on for a long time?

We have already said publicly that many of the assets in the UK are coming to the end of life; this is going to start happening within a year. This means we have no option but to close them — you can’t run them if they are not safe. We have a year to take a call on that. We are hoping that in the next few months, we will come to some sort of conclusion. But the outside timeline is what you said, the end-of-life of the assets,

Your capex is driven by India demand. What makes you so bullish about India?

Traditionally India had consumption-led growth. Over the last few years, we are seeing more investment-led growth. That’s good for steel; in this industry, the intensity of growth is higher when it is investment-led growth. Most developing countries have a steel consumption growth rate that is higher than the GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate. Even when China was growing at a GDP growth rate of 10 percent, steel consumption was growing at 15 percent. In India, it has been the other way around; steel consumption has grown slower than the GDP growth rate.

That’s changing. Now, we are seeing steel consumption growing at a faster rate than the GDP growth rate, as it should. And that gives us the confidence that demand in India will continue to be strong. Prices will vary with international prices. But we are one of the lowest cost producers of steel in the world. Even if you see last quarter, the EBITDA margin in the India business is over 20 percent. And this is when steel prices are quite low and overall, most steel companies are not doing so great. So, I think we have the confidence that we are in a good cost position, we have the confidence that demand in India will grow. And we have a very strong franchise in the marketplace with our retail business, our brands, our relationship with OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), our dominant or strong position in auto and other high-end sectors. That’s why we want to keep growing in India and that helps the overall Tata Steel balance sheet and the overall Tata Steel portfolio.

Earlier in the year, Tata Steel had said that it plans a capex of Rs 16,000 crore for 2023-24. Is it on track? How are you financing it?

We are on track; we spent Rs 4,000 crore in the first quarter alone. Most of it will go towards completing the Kalinganagar project and the associated work. We have the internal cash flows to support that. We are also focused on our debt.

So, last fiscal you slashed your debt reduction target. Then the company indicated that it will resume its deleveraging exercise and reduce debt by $1 billion in FY24. Where do we stand on that plan right now?

Ever since we said that we will reduce debt by $1 billion every year, we have done it every year apart from last year. This year, of course, the first two quarters have been more challenging than we thought. But still, we have not given up on that target. I think we can manage a good balance between deleveraging and growth because of the strong cash flows out of India. It’s too early to give up on the debt reduction target.

Tata Steel’s focus has been on brownfield expansion but there are some opportunities in the secondary market, like NMDC and some assets of Vedanta. Are you keen to look at that space?

At the moment, we are focused on our organic growth because in the last few years we did more inorganic growth. This has given us sites on which to work on. So, between the Neelachal Ispat Nigam’s Kalinganagar site and the Bhushan Steel site — both of which we acquired — and Jamshedpur, we can actually build about 40 to 50 million tonnes on these sites. We have said we want to build 40-million-tonne capacity by 2030. Now, it’s more about execution than anything else. We don’t really need to look at any inorganic growth opportunities, we will stay focused on what we have.

Decarbonisation is a big theme globally, especially in energy-intensive sectors like steel manufacturing. Carbon taxes will kick in soon. This is happening at a time when there are challenges in the macroeconomic situation and commodity cycle. How hard is it to be on track with your decarbonisation plan?

The transition needs three stakeholders to play their role. One is the industry — we need to plan capex for the transition. Second, the transition needs the regulatory environment to support that. If I take Europe as an example, which is in some sense ahead of the rest of the world on the regulatory environment, there is a policy framework that includes the carbon border adjustment mechanism, which is aimed at encouraging local steel companies to transition into a greener future. The carbon border adjustment mechanism says that anybody who is selling steel in Europe has to pay the carbon tax. Then, third, you need to have customers who are willing to pay a premium, because green steel comes with a premium. Any geography which wants to transition, needs the industry to commit and do what it has to do, the government to create that framework and the environment, and customers (to be) willing to pay more. The plans are being made for both the Netherlands and in the UK, using all these elements or ingredients.

In India, I think we are moving in that direction. A lot more needs to be done on a policy basis. We need to also have customers willing to pay more for green steel; I can hear some customers talking about it. As an industry, we need to invest in it, which we are already doing. There is no silver bullet. There will be multiple solutions that we need to develop and scale up. It is going to be a very exciting phase which will create a lot of opportunities. It is also going to create a lot of demand for steel, because all new energy sources also have steel in some form or the other involved in generating or transmission or storage of energy.

You are juggling many balls right now. The Tata Steel board has reappointed you for another five years. As you start a new term, what is your biggest goal for the next term?

Tata Steel, which saw its net profit plummet in the first quarter of fiscal 2023-24, expects the second half of the year to be better. But Europe may see economic rebound only next year, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer TV Narendran told Moneycontrol in an interview on July 25.

Narendran said the company is optimistic about strong steel demand in India and is on track for its planned capital expenditure of Rs 16,000 crore for the year.

On July 24, Tata Steel reported that its net profit declined 93 percent year on year to Rs 525 crore in the first quarter of 2023-24 as its Europe operations reported a loss for the third consecutive quarter.

“We expect H2 to be much stronger than H1 for multiple reasons. We expect that China exports will reduce in H2, which will bring more stability to international steel prices. The India demand post monsoons should be strong, leading up to the elections,” Narendran said.

China has been increasing its steel exports amid weak global demand, which has led to moderation in the price of the commodity. Narendran said that he expects that globally, inflation will slowly cool off and there may be a pause on rate hikes, which may support the steel industry.

“Europe will slowly recover. Next year will be better than this year from a macroeconomic point of view…I think it will be next year before you really see economic activity come back strongly in Europe,” he said.

Tata Steel’s Europe revenues were £2,083 million in the June quarter, and its EBITDA loss stood at £153 million. The company witnessed lower revenues due to a reduction in volumes even as there was an increase in realisations.

Capex on

Tata Steel spent Rs 4,000 crore in the first quarter of FY24 and is on track to spend the entire Rs 16,000 crore planned for the year.

“Traditionally India had consumption-led growth. Over the last few years, we are seeing more investment-led growth. That's good for steel; in this industry, the intensity of growth is higher when it is investment-led growth,” Narendran said.

Tata Steel’s India business reported a strong showing with both production and deliveries growing. Crude steel production was around 5 million tonne, up 2 percent YoY, primarily driven by a ramp-up at Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd, which was acquired by a subsidiary of Tata Steel in 2022.

But even as the company scales up capacity, in line with its target to double it to 40 million tonne per annum by 2030, it is also hoping to resume its deleveraging plan.

“We are also focused on our debt. We have said that every year we want to reduce the debt by a billion dollars. Ever since we said it, apart from last year, every year we have done it. This year, the first two quarters have been more challenging than we thought. But we have not given up on that target,” Narendran said.

The company’s net debt rose to Rs 71,397 crore at the end of the June quarter from Rs 67,810 crore at end-March 2023.",533,0.20621262192726136

Shares of Tata Steel rose over 3 percent on July 25 as the company's better-than-expected earnings for the April-June quarter supported sentiment.

The stock opened one percent lower but soon recouped its losses and was quoting Rs 119.60 on the NSE, in the afternoon trade. The stock had hit an intraday low of Rs 114.35 earlier in the session.

The steel manufacturer's consolidated net profit of Tata Steel plummeted 93 percent year-on-year to Rs 525 crore in Q1. This downturn was primarily attributed to the performance of its Europe operations.

Comparatively, the company's net profit in the same quarter a year ago was much higher at Rs 7,714 crore, and in the previous quarter (January-March 2023), it stood at Rs 1,566 crore.

The profit for the current quarter was further affected by a non-cash deferred tax charge resulting from the buy-in transaction at the British Steel Pension Scheme. However, the completion of the insurance buy-in of the British Steel Pension Scheme was successful, effectively reducing risks for Tata Steel UK, as stated by the company.

Moreover, the company's revenue for the quarter also declined over 6 percent on year to Rs 59,490 crore, down from Rs 63,430 crore recorded in the year-ago period. The company attributed the fall in revenues to lower volumes, partly offset by higher realisations across geographies.

Despite the sharp fall in numbers, Tata Steel's topline as well as bottomline still came above the Street's expectations of Rs 56,337.80 crore and Rs 122.80 crore, respectively. In that way, the better-than-expected earnings prevented a sharp slump in the steel manufacturer's stock price.

In the first quarter, the steelmaker's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to Rs 6,122 crore. This represents a significant decrease from the EBITDA of Rs 15,047 crore reported in the same quarter of the previous year.

However, the company clarified that its adjusted EBITDA stood at Rs 6,238 crore after accounting for changes related to foreign exchange movements on intercompany debt, receivables, and the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS).

Brokerage firm Morgan Stanley also stated that the company's EBITDA came ahead of the firm's estimate led by better realisations but were still partially offset by higher operational expenditures. The firm has an 'equalweight' call for the stock with a price target of Rs 110.

The consolidated net profit of Tata Steel plummeted 93 percent year-on-year to Rs 525 crore in the first quarter of 2023-24, weighed down by its Europe operations.

The company’s net profit was Rs 7,714 crore in the same quarter a year ago, and Rs 1,566 crore in the previous one (January-March 2023).

Profit in the quarter was also dented by a non-cash deferred tax charge on account of buy-in transaction at British Steel Pension Scheme. With this, the insurance buy-in of British Steel Pension Scheme has been completed, successfully de-risking Tata Steel UK, the company said.

The consolidated total revenue from operations came in at Rs 59,490 crore, which is 6.3 percent lower as against Rs 63,430 crore reported in the year-ago period. The revenue clocked is also around 5.5 percent lower as against Rs 62,961 crore reported in Q4FY23. The company said that the revenues decreased due to lower volumes, partly offset by higher realisations across geographies.

According to a Bloomberg survey of 12 brokers, Tata Steel’s consolidated net sales were expected to come in at Rs 56,337.80 crore, down 10.75 percent year-on-year (YoY). Net loss was estimated at Rs 122.80 crore, according to 11 brokers.

“During the quarter, global economic recovery continued to face headwinds affecting commodity prices including steel. In India, domestic steel demand continued to grow and was up around 10 percent on YoY basis but steel spot prices moderated in line with global cues,” TV Narendran, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, said in a statement.

Shares of Tata Steel closed on July 24 at Rs 115.45 a share on the BSE, down 1 percent over the previous close. The company announced its result after trading hours.

The steelmaker’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) in Q1FY24 was Rs 6,122 crore as against Rs 15,047 in the same quarter a year ago. The company said that its EBITDA was at Rs 6,238 crore, adjusted for changes on account of foreign exchange movement on intercompany debt, receivables and BSPS.

Chief Financial Officer Koushik Chatterjee said, “Despite a moderation in global steel spreads, our margin was broadly stable at around 10 percent. India business generated higher margin of around 22 percent and EBITDA stood at Rs 7,514 crore.”

The company said in a presentation that its net debt rose to Rs 71,397 crore at the end of the June-quarter from Rs 67,810 crore at end-March.

“Volatility in steel markets has impacted working capital and cash flows but we continue to commit to growth in India and spent Rs 4,089 crore on capital expenditure during the quarter. This has led to a Net debt of Rs 71,397 crore. Group liquidity position remains strong at Rs 30,569 crore, which includes Rs 19,043 crore of cash and cash equivalents,” Chatterjee said.

India ops

India revenue in Q1FY24 was Rs 34,901 crore, up 2.6 percent. But EBITDA declined to Rs 7,514 crore from Rs 9,582 crore a year ago.

“In India, domestic steel demand continued to grow and was up around 10 percent on YoY basis but steel spot prices moderated in line with global cues,” Narendran said. He was also reappointed by the board as MD and CEO at the board meeting on July 24 for another 5 years.

Tata Steel’s India business reported a strong showing with both production and deliveries growing. Crude steel production was around 5 million tons, up 2 percent YoY, primarily driven by ramp up at Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited, which was acquired by a subsidiary of Tata Steel in 2022.

Deliveries in the June quarter were at 4.8 million tons, higher by 18 percent on YoY basis, driven by higher local demand.

Tata Steel said it is scaling up to capitalise on India growth opportunity and reiterated its plan to double its capacity to 40 million ton per annum (mtpa) by 2030.

Europe disappoints

Tata Steel’s Europe revenues were £2,083 million in the June quarter, and its EBITDA loss stood at £153 million. Revenues was lower on reduction in volumes, which was partly offset by increase in realisations, the company said.

“The planned relining of BF6 at Tata Steel Netherlands commenced in April and this has led to drop in crude steel production,” the company said.

With China increasing its steel exports amid weak global demand, the prices for the commodity moderated in the quarter.

“In Europe, margins were broadly similar on QoQ basis as rise in revenue per ton was offset by lower volumes and elevated input costs,” Chatterjee said.",799,-0.003591395914554596

Tata Steel is likely to report a loss for the period ending June 30, 2023 (Q1FY24) due to the double whammy of lower realisations and underperformance of its European operations. The company will announce its June quarter earnings on July 24.

According to a Bloomberg survey of 12 brokers, Tata Steel’s consolidated net sales are expected to come in at Rs 56,337.80 crore, down 10.75 percent YoY. Net loss is estimated at Rs 122.80 crore, according to 11 brokers.

The Tata Group-backed steelmaker's EBITDA may fall 37 percent QoQ and 70 percent YoY.

Tata Steel had clocked revenues of Rs 63,128.32 crore in Q1 FY23 and a net profit of Rs 7,714 crore. In the preceding quarter ended March 2023, the company had posted revenues of Rs 62,238.78 crore and a net profit of Rs 1,566.24 crore.

Analysts estimate that Tata Steel Europe will post an EBITDA loss of $81/ton (-$92/ton in 4QFY23) led by weak demand and higher costs, partially offset by improved realizations QoQ.

Analysts also attributed the poor earnings to weak realisations stemming from lower global base metal prices (steel, aluminum, etc.), reduced average selling prices (ASP), sluggish global demand, and a slower-than-expected recovery in China.

""We estimate 1Q volumes (standalone) to decrease 10.7 percent QoQ to 4.4 million tons. We expect realisations to remain flat while EBITDA/ton (standalone) is expected to decrease by 21.3 percent QoQ to Rs13.1k/t. Corus EBITDA/ton is expected at negative $85/t,"" brokerage JM Financial said in a note to investors.

Tata Steel's provisional sales volumes for Q1 FY24 showed positive growth in its Indian operations, with sales standing at 4.8 million metric tonnes (MT), up 15 percent YoY. This increase was attributed to the ramp-up of NINL (Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited). However, on a QoQ basis, sales volume declined by 10 percent due to a planned maintenance shutdown.

In contrast, Tata Steel Europe experienced a decline in sales volume to 1.97 MT, down 8 percent YoY and 9 percent QoQ. This reduction was mainly due to the planned re-lining of a blast furnace at Tata Steel Netherlands, which began in April 2023, resulting in a decrease in crude steel production at Tata Steel Europe.

""We expect consolidated revenue to fall QoQ led by lower sales volume which will offset the higher price realisation in India (Rs 1,200/t QoQ improvement guidance) and Europe (£15/t QoQ improvement guidance).

“Revenue will fall YoY due to lower HRC prices, which will partially be offset by higher sales volume. We expect EBITDA Margins to fall both YoY/QoQ, led by lower topline and higher coal and energy costs. Benefits from the lower coking coal costs will accrue from Q2FY24,"" said Axis Securities.

Brokerage firm PhilipCapital expects Tata Steel to post a loss on consolidated basis due to non-cash tax expenses amounting to Rs 1,500 crore on the British Pension Scheme separation. The brokerage expects a fall in volume across various geographies. Additionally, realisations are expected to be lower, while the cost of production (CoP) witnessed an increase.

Shares of Tata Steel are down 2.14 percent on YTD basis, but the 1-year return stands at 25 percent.

The Tata group's announcement of setting up a 40 GW battery cell gigafactory with an investment of over £4 billion in the United Kingdom (UK) comes close on the heels of its $1.6 billion MoU with the Gujarat government for setting up a similar plant in the state. Taken together, with two such factories, the Indian conglomerate bids fair to emerge as a major player in the global electric vehicle supply chain.

Its two captive auto-making units, Tata Motors at home, and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) in Europe give it the advantage of two anchor customers already in place, a definite edge over other pure-play battery makers. For instance, Chinese company Envision, currently the only other battery maker in the UK, bought Nissan's electric car battery business in 2019, presumably for just such a symbiotic relationship.

For Tata, the synergies between the two businesses are huge, with both Tata Motors and JLR setting themselves firmly on the road to redemption through electric vehicles. Since it bought JLR in 2008, the Indian conglomerate has faced challenges in being consistently profitable with its acquisition. But driven by increasing volumes from the British carmaker, Tata Motors reported a profitable fourth quarter and a plan for JLR to invest a whopping $19 billion in electric vehicles over the next five years.

The battery manufacturing plan, though, also needs to be looked at in the larger context of the somewhat frosty relations between another Tata group company, Tata Steel, and the UK government. A decision on potential closure of its Port Talbot steelworks, which came with another of its acquisitions, that of Corus in 2007, looms large with the future of 9000 workers in the balance.

Tata Steel had said it might consider shutting down its UK operations if its demand for a financial package of £1.5 billion from the UK government to support its decarbonization plans was not met. The UK government, in turn, had offered £300 million to the company, a deal it offered to sweeten somewhat in April. But after posting a steep 84 percent fall in its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended March 2023, the Indian company didn't appear in the mood to relent.

As the UK's largest steelworks, the Port Talbot plant's future is a political hot potato for the government in power. Its closure could lead to a surge of Chinese steel into the country, though the threat of lost jobs has so far dissuaded the nation's government from calling Tata's bluff, if indeed it is that. While the stalemate continues, it is a headache for both parties.

The announcement of the new gigafactory, therefore, should act as a balm on these pain points. It helps that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government is believed to be providing substantial financial support, including a special deal on energy costs for the project. That is the global norm, with countries offering sops to battery makers to set up manufacturing.

The UK trails its neighbors like Germany in battery manufacturing capacity, with the EU already home to 25 gigafactories that are either operational, under construction, or in the planning stage. In January of this year, the home-grown Britishvolt's £3.8 billion gigafactory plan collapsed when the company declared bankruptcy after failing to find financial backing. That exposed the country's vulnerabilities as it chases a green future. According to projections by the Faraday Institution, there will be a demand for 10 UK-based gigafactories (large, high-volume battery manufacturing facilities) by 2040, each producing 20 GWh per year of batteries. These are imperative if the country is to achieve its net-zero target.

The mega investment from Tata will go some way in filling the gap and will act as a boost for the UK government. No wonder Sunak called it a ""huge vote of confidence in Britain."" Indeed, Sunak's statement, which formed part of the press release issued by Tata Sons, indicates that he is prepared to play an active role in promoting the country's economic interests.

If he extends that to the subsidy that Tata Steel has been asking for, Tata's Indian summer in England would be complete.",686,0.13363683223724365

The market, despite Friday's correction, ended the last week on a positive note and continued upward rally for second consecutive week on July 7. The Nifty50 hit a fresh record high before getting into correction on Friday and settled tad above 19,300, down 0.85 percent, whereas for the week, it rallied 0.74 percent.

The index has formed bullish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow on the weekly charts, indicating selling pressure or failure to sustain at record high levels, but the higher highs formation continued for 15th consecutive week, which is a positive sign.

After the breakout of horizontal as well as upward sloping resistance trendlines in previous week ending June 30, the index sustained uptrend in following week, which is a positive sign. Overall, the index is likely to continue its march upwards amid consolidation with hurdle at 19,500-19,600 levels, whereas the near term support is expected to be 19,300-19,200 levels, followed by crucial support at 19,000, experts said.

""We believe the bull run is likely to continue, marking the start of a major upward movement. However, the momentum on the upside may not match the intensity of the past couple of weeks. Considering the overbought conditions, we may witness a period of consolidation in the coming week, during which dips could be seen as buying opportunities,"" Sameet Chavan, head research, technical and derivatives at Angel One said.

On the other hand, he advised to take secure profits at higher levels and avoid complacency until the indicators exit the overbought territory.

In terms of support levels, the immediate support lies around 19,200, where a bullish gap was left last week, while the major breakout levels around 19,000-18,900 serve as a strong foundation for the market, Sameet said.

As the prices are currently in uncharted territory, it is challenging to identify resistance zones, however, the range of 19,500-19,600 appears to be an immediate hurdle for the anticipated consolidation, he believes.

Ajit Mishra, SVP - Technical Research at Religare Broking also sees consolidation, saying after the recent vertical up move in Nifty from 18,600 to 19,500 in no time, it is prudent for the index to spend some time around the current levels before marching further northwards.

He expects Nifty to respect the 18,700-19,000 zone in case of any dip, while the 19,500-19,700 zone may act as a hurdle.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the July 7 closing prices:

Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst at HDFC Securities

Granules India: Buy | LTP: Rs 311.9 | Stop-Loss: Rs 289 | Targets: Rs 340-375 | Return: 20 percent

The attached weekly timeframe chart of Granules India indicates sustainable upside bounce in the last couple of weeks. The stock price is currently in an attempt of upside breakout of the hurdle at Rs 310 levels, which is neckline of double bottom formation. Hence, a sustainable upmove from here could bring sharp upside momentum for the stock price.

We observe larger degree of higher bottom formation and the anticipated upmove could open renewed buying towards new higher top formation. Volume has started to expand during an attempt of upside breakout and weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) shows positive indication. The overall chart pattern of Granules indicates long trading opportunity.

Buying can be initiated in Granules at CMP (Rs 311.9), add more on dips down to Rs 300, wait for the upside target of Rs 340 and next Rs 375 in 1 month, with a stop-loss of Rs 289.

UPL: Sell | LTP: Rs 663 | Stop-Loss: Rs 702 | Target: Rs 615 | Return: 7 percent

After showing narrow range movement in the last two months, the stock price has slipped into weakness from the highs and closed at the lower range of Rs 660 levels as per weekly chart.

Weekly negative chart pattern like lower tops and bottoms is intact and the stock price is currently placed at the edge of downside breakout of the crucial support like ascending trend line at Rs 660 levels. Volume has started to expand on Friday during weakness in the stock price and the weekly 14 period RSI shows negative indication.

One may look to sell UPL Ltd at CMP (Rs 663), add more on rise up to Rs 685 and wait for the downside target of Rs 615 in the next 1 month. Place a stop-loss of Rs 702.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research (retail) at Kotak Securities

Technically, on weekly charts, the stock has formed higher bottom formation and comfortably trading above 200 and 50-day SMA (simple moving average) which is largely positive.

Unless it is trading below Rs 369, positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target Rs 430-450. Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any between Rs 390 and Rs 380 levels, with a stop-loss below Rs 369.

We are of the view that, as long as the stock is trading above Rs 106 the bullish formation is likely to continue. Above the same, it could move up till Rs 125-130.

For the positional traders, the strategy would be to buy in two parts, at Rs 112 and at Rs 109. Keep a stop-loss at Rs 106 for the target of Rs 125 and Rs 130.

Tech Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,156 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,100 | Targets: Rs 1,250-1,275 | Return: 10 percent

After a short-term correction, the stock took the support near 200-day SMA and bounced back sharply. Post reversal the stock rallied over 10 percent. In the last week, it registered a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,184.95.

Currently, the stock is comfortably trading above short term and medium term averages which supports further uptrend from the current levels. Technically, higher bottom formation on daily and weekly charts indicating uptrend wave is likely to continue in the near future.

For Traders, the strategy would be to buy in two parts, at Rs 1,156 and a tRs 1,120. Keep a stop-loss at Rs 1,100 for targets of Rs 1,250 and Rs 1,275.

Tata Steel on July 6 said that its India crude steel production stood at 5.01 million tons (provisionally), with a growth of 2 percent year-on-year (YoY) primarily driven by the ramp-up at Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (NINL) for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The company also added that the production was lower QoQ on planned maintenance shutdowns.

Deliveries at 4.8 million tonnes were higher by 18 percent on a YoY basis, driven by a rise in domestic deliveries, while exports moderated on YoY basis to 0.25 million tonnes.

Tata Steel's automotive and special products segment deliveries were broadly similar on YoY basis, it said in a statement. Among the sub-segments, production of passenger vehicles and 2-wheelers was up while commercial vehicles declined.

Moreover, branded products and retail segment deliveries increased by 37 percent YoY. ""This was driven by best ever 1Q sales of well-established brands - Tata Tiscon and Tata Steelium,"" it said.

Industrial products and projects increased by 24 percent YoY driven by a sustained increase in the sale of value-added products to key segments like Railways, Pre-engineered buildings etc.

Additionally, Tata Steel said that the planned relining of BF6 at Tata Steel Netherlands commenced in April and this has led to a drop in crude steel production at Tata Steel Europe. Crude steel production stood at 1.81 mn tons while deliveries stood at 1.97 million tonnes.

Tata Steel Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran highlighted the numerous opportunities that lie ahead for Tata Steel in his speech at the company's Annual General Meeting (AGM) on July 5.

Despite the challenging global environment, Chandrasekaran expressed optimism about the Indian economy, stating that it remains on a positive trajectory.

The company projected an estimated GDP growth of around 6.1 percent for India in 2023-34, positioning it as one of the fastest-growing economies.

Discussing the steel industry, the chairman noted that it, too, experienced the repercussions of global volatility, leading to fluctuations in the steel demand-supply balance and prices. However, he emphasised India's resilience in this context, attributing it to robust government spending and vibrant consumption.

He projected India's continued significance as a major consumer in the global steel industry due to ongoing infrastructure development, rapid urbanisation, and supportive policy reforms.

Acknowledging Tata Steel's performance, Chandrasekaran attributed the company's financial challenges in the fiscal year 2022-23 to higher cost structures, including elevated energy and emission-related expenses, as well as volatility in raw material prices.

Looking ahead, he said that Tata Steel is committed to expanding its presence in India. ""On the growth front, the company continues to scale up its business in India by way of both organic capital expansion and inorganic acquisitions and is steadfast in its objective of achieving its 2030 target of an overall 40 MnTPA capacity in India,"" he added.",234,0.6269067100116185

Tata Steel Ltd. says it won’t be able to achieve a goal to cut emissions by 2030 unless development of new technologies is accelerated.

India’s second-largest steel producer is seeking to trim emissions from the current 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide for every ton of the alloy produced to 1.8 tons in 2030, and achieve net zero by 2045. That’s even as it plans to double its Indian capacity to 40 million tons by the end of the decade.

“New technologies have to come in,” Debashish Bhattacharjee, vice president of technology and research and development at Tata Steel, said in an interview this week. The company is relying on use of scrap metals to cut emissions for now, he said.

Tata’s warning comes as global steelmakers face massive costs to green their operations. The European Union is planning to implement taxes on supplies from high emission-producing countries, potentially hitting profitability of mills struggling to reach net zero targets.

Expectations that production costs will rise due to the newer technologies will also prove to be a challenge to steelmakers, Bhattacharjee said. The exact amount will depend on factors including the cost of scrap and hydrogen, the ability to generate profits from other products generated from carbon dioxide, and potential new carbon taxes, he said.

The global steel industry is experimenting with several decarbonization techniques, all of which are at an early stage of development. One of the most promising involves replacing coal with green hydrogen, which is made using renewable power.

However, limitations in the use of hydrogen and scrap in the steelmaking process, coupled with low quality domestic iron ore, could hamper decarbonization efforts, Bhattacharjee said.

“If the world largely moves to hydrogen-based direct reduced iron and electric arc furnaces, then high quality ore will be at a premium — it’s already a premium, it will be more so,” he said. “So there is a huge economic risk that we see if you go entirely in that route, even if the electricity and hydrogen is green.”

Two Options

Tata Steel is looking at two options for its integrated plants: initial use of natural gas to be replaced by hydrogen in its blast furnaces, and carbon capture, utilization and storage.

Carbon capture and sequestration may also not be a scalable option as companies will need specific geographical formations to store the emissions either under the sea or in caverns. No such geological formations have been discovered close to eastern India where Tata Steel’s plants are located, according to Bhattacharjee.

“So our philosophy is to work on multiple streams because there is no single answer,” he said. All new technologies will need money for development and policy interventions from the Indian government to help accelerate implementation at scale, he said.

Tata Steel’s Pilot Projects

-The company is developing a pilot plant in Kalinganagar for biomass, to produce green hydrogen-rich gas and leave a green biochar that can be used in place of coke in blast furnaces

-Tata Steel has licensed a chemical looping technology for upscaling and has a trial plant in Jamshedpur to generate its own heat to run the process. It will produce blue hydrogen without requiring electricity

-It has set up a carbon capture and utilization pilot plant in Jamshedpur. The captured carbon dioxide is to be used to clean water going into the cooling circuit. Tata has been buying carbon dioxide for this purpose, so the technology should reduce expenses and partly pay for the cost for carbon capture

-Tata Steel has recently signed a preliminary agreement with Germany’s SMS Group for a technology to produce electrically-assisted hydrogen-rich gas by smelting and introducing it into the blast furnace to reduce carbon dioxide by half",637,-0.40570404132207233

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tata Steel

Our analysis of TATA’s FY23 annual report showed that despite an adverse macro-economic environment and geopolitical volatility, the domestic growth story remained resilient for the company. Steel demand in India is expected to mimic the GDP growth rate, driven by higher budgetary outlay toward infrastructure and higher private sector consumption. Steel demand is expected to remain robust across key sectors, such as construction, infrastructure, automobiles, railways and white goods. TATA remains buoyant about domestic steel demand over the next decade and is expected to almost double its domestic capacity to 40mt from 21mt. The capacity expansion will help TATA navigate steel cycles, capitalize multiple opportunities and simultaneously deleverage its balance sheet. TATA expects to resume its deleveraging exercise and targets to reduce its debt by USD1b in FY24.

Outlook

TATA is currently trading at 5.8x FY24E EV/EBITDA and we reiterate our Neutral rating on the stock with a SoTP-based TP of INR110.

Industry giant Tata Steel is planning a consolidated capital expenditure (capex) of Rs 16,000 crore for its domestic and global operations during the current financial year, according to its top management.

Of the planned amount, Tata Steel has earmarked Rs 10,000 crore towards standalone operations and Rs 2,000 crore for its subsidiaries in India, the company's CEO & MD T V Narendran and Executive Director & CFO Koushik Chatterjee said.

""The projected capital expenditure (capex) for FY2023-24 is set at Rs 16,000 crore on a consolidated basis which is intended to be financed through internal accruals over the full year,"" the executives said in the company's annual report for 2022-23.

Of this, Rs 10,000 crore has been earmarked towards Tata Steel Standalone operations of which the Kalinganagar project will account for approximately 70 per cent, they said.

The company is in process of expanding capacity of its plant at Kalinganagar, in Odisha to 8 MT from 3 MT.

""Our other Indian subsidiaries, currently in an expansion phase with value accretive projects, especially in downstream operations which are important to service customer needs and improve our value-added product mix, will have a capex of about Rs 2,000 crore,"" the company officials said.

In Europe, Tata Steel Nederland will incur capex of Rs 1,100 crore on the relining of its blast furnace, which is underway. The remainder of the capex is largely allocated towards and will be spent on sustenance, environmental initiatives, and improvement projects, the leaders said.

Tata Steel has planned capital expenditure (capex) of Rs 12,000 crore on its India and Europe operations during the 2022-23 financial year. While Rs 8,500 crore is for India and Rs 3,500 crore for operations in Europe, Narendran had told PTI in July 2022.

In the UK, Tata Steel has had active and detailed discussions with the UK government in relation to the future of its business there.

Given the UK's decarbonisation journey and rising carbon costs, it has been clear that for the continuity of steel making in the long-term, it is necessary for Port Talbot to transition to alternative green technologies.

The discussions are ongoing and at the same time, some of the existing heavy-end assets in Tata Steel UK will reach the end of life over the following few years.

The management of Tata Steel UK will evaluate all scenarios with regard to the future configuration of the business and will consult appropriately with various stakeholders prior to relevant strategic decisions being taken.

Steel manufacturer Tata Steel has exuded confidence about India being a silver lining in the global market.

“India remains the ‘bright spot’ for global steel demand,” the Tata Group company has said in its annual report for FY22-23, released on June 14.

The company said the outlook for India remains positive, led by strong urban consumption and infrastructure spending.

This comes at a time when demand in the US is seen growing at a moderate pace, sustained inflation continues to pose a downside risk and when exports are expected to decline further with a rise in protectionism and a slowdown in global demand.

Tata Steel expects Indian steel demand to be robust, growing by 6.2 percent in FY23-24, supported by a strong GDP growth forecast, private consumption and government expenditure.

Around 85 percent of the company’s overall revenue comes from Indian operations, according to analysts.

Strong demand from key steel-consuming sectors

Demand from key steel-consuming sectors, such as construction, capital goods, railways, and automotive, is expected to remain robust.

India’s capital goods sector is expected to benefit from the momentum in infrastructure and investment in renewable energy, while automotive and consumer durables are expected to maintain healthy growth, driven by sustained growth in private consumption, it added.

The approval process across industries, such as energy, automobiles, and packaging, is stringent and time-consuming and continues to be an entry barrier for new players.

This gives companies like Tata Steel an edge over others as they enjoy long-standing relationships with customers, Motilal Oswal Financial Services had pointed out in a note.

Besides, integrated steel players will continue to add capacity in FY23-24 and utilisation levels are expected to remain healthy at approximately 80 percent, the steelmaker said.

India business sees improvement

During the March 2023 quarter, the steel manufacturer’s profitability improved primarily on its India performance. India registered the highest annual crude steel production of 19.88 million tonnes (MT) and record deliveries of 18.87 MT.

India business witnessed a margin improvement from 15 percent to 22 percent, driven by improved realisations on a QoQ basis, compared to Europe, where margins were broadly similar, sequentially, as improvement in costs was offset by a drop in revenues.

The company decreased its net debt by Rs 3,900 crore in Q4 of FY23 to Rs 67,810 crore QoQ, because of a release in working capital.

A larger view is that although weak global demand remains a key concern, strong domestic demand and a likely decline in raw material costs in the coming quarters will continue to support earnings performance in the long term.

At 12:09 pm, shares of Tata Steel were up 1.9 percent on the BSE at Rs 113.2. The steelmaker's scrip was the second biggest gainer on benchmark Nifty 5o index.

Major metal producers in the country are likely to hit the pause button on debt-based funding and use internal accruals instead to fund capital expenditure (capex) in FY24. Top executives cited higher capital costs as the reason.

India’s top metal producers – Hindalco Industries, JSW Steel, Steel Authority of India, Tata Steel, and Hindustan Zinc, combined have earmarked around Rs 63,400 crore as capex in FY24. Three of these five companies have indicated capex during the year will be funded through internal accruals, while the other two remain hopeful of a debt reduction despite capex.

Fuelling this aversion to debt are two factors – favourable raw-material prices and an unfavourable interest rate cycle.

“Interest rates have gone up. That's why we do not want to go into the market to borrow at this time. So, we will work with our internal accruals because money costs more now with interest rates where they are,” said Satish Pai, Managing Director at Hindalco Industries in a post Q4 FY23 earnings interview with Moneycontrol.

Hindalco plans to invest Rs 5,000 crore as capex in India and another $1.8 billion in the US, both funded through cash flows.

Hindustan Zinc’s top finance executive echoed similar views. “Unless we feel that we are getting it at a very attractive rate, which is less than what I can yield in the market from our long-term investments, (we won’t raise funds for capex),” said Sandeep Modi, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for the company which plans to invest $200 million as capex.

Analysts with India Ratings noted balance sheets of steel companies strengthened over FY21-FY22 enabling them to deleverage below three times compared to pre-pandemic levels of above three times. “The increase in debt on account of capex is likely to be partially mitigated by a release of working capital,” they further said in a sector note released on May 29.

Metal companies are now focused on maintaining debt at a healthy level throughout the commodity cycle. “Even in the down cycle I wouldn’t like to violate 1.5 times of net-debt-to-EBITDA,” said Bimlendra Jha, Managing Director at Jindal Steel and Power in an earnings call with analysts post announcement of Q4 FY23 results, on May 22. Jha said the company will share its capital allocation policy in a few weeks.

Tata Steel, which plans to spend Rs 16,000 crore in FY24, is confident of returning to its target of reducing debt by $1 billion every year.

Rating agency Crisil in a note released on May 29 said, higher cash accrual for steel companies is expected to be driven by volume growth, backed by strong demand pull and operating margin expansion (of 100-200 basis points (bps) due to softening prices of coking coal, which accounts for 40 percent of the overall production cost.

JSW Steel plans to fund most of its Rs 19,500-crore capex for FY24 through internal accruals, “….assuming that we are able to get the benefit of raw material costs flowing in,” said Jayant Acharya, Joint Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company.

JSW Steel plans to raise funds through different instruments, including non-convertible debentures (NCDs) to the tune of Rs 18,000 crore, most of which, the management said, would be used for debt repayment due this financial year.

The top management at Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) in a post-Q4-FY23 earnings call noted a similar expectation that debt will reduce depending on the decline in coking coal price and realisation, analysts with ICICI Securities wrote in a note on the company.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tata Steel

TATA is all set to capitalize the vast growth in domestic steel demand amid rapid expansion in the infrastructure, construction, and automobile sector. We believe TATA is adding capacity at the right time to capture the robust growth journey. TATA is one of the largest and cost-efficient steel manufacturers with strong raw material security, which ensures adequate and timely supply of raw materials. With multiple iron mines in India and Canada, TATA’s entire iron ore requirement is met by its captive mines. TATA is also enhancing its iron ore mining capacity from 36mt to 60-65mt , which will ensure adequate iron ore requirement for expanded capacity. TATA offers a wide gamut of flat and long steel products with emphasis on Value-added products (VAP) catering to sectors such as automobile, retail, packaging, construction, energy, consumer durables, and engineering. Globally, steel prices have been under pressure, on the back of lower demand from the USA and Europe and lower-than-expected pickup from China.



Outlook

While TATA is well placed, the stock trades at 5.5x FY24E EV/EBITDA and we believe it is fully priced in at current levels. We reiterate our Neutral rating on the stock with a SoTP based TP of INR110.

Any closure of upstream assets in the UK on reaching end-of-life will cost Tata Steel more than £100 million, top executives from the steel major told analysts last week. The company further said that the UK operations reported a cash burn of $150 million in the second half of FY22-23, higher than what they had guided earlier.

Tata Steel has been in discussions with the UK government, seeking financial support for a green transition of its UK assets. So far, it said, the talks have remained inconclusive.

In an interview with Moneycontrol, TV Narendran, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Tata Steel, said that in the worst-case scenario, if the UK government did not help finance a green transition, different UK (upstream) assets would be closed as they reached end-of-life.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel (TATA) reported in line operating performance aided by improved ASP for India business, higher volumes, lower coking coal consumption cost and better operating efficiencies during 4QFY23. TATA’s standalone revenue was down 7% YoY/up 13% QoQ at INR343b, in line with our estimate of INR329b. Standalone EBITDA declined 34% YoY/up 58% QoQ at INR81b (14% above our estimate of INR71b). Standalone ASP improved INR2,453/t QoQ to INR68,826/t and EBITDA/t improved INR5,085/t QoQ to16,326 (6% above our estimate of INR15,335). APAT was down 40% YoY/up 74% QoQ to INR47b (13% higher). The QoQ improvement was led by higher volumes, lower coking coal consumption cost, lower freight & handling charges, and lower depreciation that was partially offset by higher interest cost, increase in forex impact, higher royalty expense and higher tax.

Outlook

We have marginally raised our estimates to factor in the improved outlook with lower input costs. The stock is trading at 5.6x FY24E EV/EBITDA and 1.3x FY24E P/B and we believe it is fully priced in at current levels.

Tata Steel expects India's demand story to remain strong, and is hopeful China will surprise positively for the remaining part of the year. T. V. Narendran, Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Tata Steel spoke to Moneycontrol on the company's latest quarter results, debt reduction, recession fears in Europe and US, and green steel package for its UK assets. Edited excerpts from the conversation:

We've seen some sequential improvement in the India operations, not so much for the Europe operations. Take us through the factors at play and your expectations, going forward.

Yes, it has been a better quarter than the previous quarter. If I look at India or if I look at it at an overall level, the volumes were higher than Q3. So, that played out from a benefit point of view. (In) India, we had the benefit of higher volumes, (and) higher prices because steel prices went up during the quarter, thanks to China opening up and removing all the COVID restrictions. So, the overall sentiment in the steel industry changed. (As for) Europe, energy prices stopped going up. We've not got the full benefit of falling gas and electricity costs because we have a hedge on the future. Hence, the benefit of spot prices will play out for us, maybe in Q2 or Q3. So, if I look at India, performance has been operationally strong, prices have been good, costs under control. Neelachal volumes are also helping us. So overall, it has been positive.

In Europe, in Netherlands – we have some specific challenges because we are taking down or we have taken down a blast furnace for relining. We had guided (for) a couple of challenging quarters; that will continue because the blast furnace will come back only in August. That's almost like 40-45 percent of our production is down. It may not be reflected in sales because we have built up some slab stocks, but the cost will be higher because we're operating at less than optimal capacity. So, that's why you will see the European numbers weak for Q1 as well, won't get worse than what it was the last quarter, but will not get significantly better till we get to Q2.

UK continues to be a challenge. We expect EBITDA to be negative, but moving towards a better number, but still negative during this quarter. So, challenges remain in Europe and will get resolved only from Q2 onwards.

Staying on Europe, your commentary talks of the stress test for UK, you're expecting it to be adversely impacted. A letter of support has been extended by the parent company to the UK operations. How will this impact your consolidated EBITDA? Also, what are the factors playing out there, including recession fears.

So, Europe EBITDA numbers are what we have reported. We don't report UK and Netherlands separately. But largely for the year, UK was negative. I mean, UK was negative and Netherlands was positive. That's largely been the story for most of the last 10-12 years. The Dutch business has always been cash flow positive and EBITDA positive. So, the challenge continues. I think, the larger point for us and which is a conversation with the UK government is that the assets as they are in the UK cannot survive for long because they're coming to end-of-life. And in the next year or two, we'll have to take a call because you can't run them as it is. Hence, our proposal was to transition into a different process route, a greener process route, and seeking support from the government, because, again, the cash flows of the business do not allow us to fund that transition. The government has come back with a proposal which is not close to what we have asked for, and so that conversation is going on.

Is this proposal from the government a more recent one or is it the same that we had discussed a quarter ago?

Yeah, I think pretty much the same one. They're trying to see what they can do. Obviously, that's a conversation which is going on in the government.

Could you give us a best case scenario and a worst case scenario for Europe?

The best case scenario is if the government supports the transition, you can transition to a new process route. Obviously, we will need to syndicate this with all the stakeholders, including the unions, but a fundamental point is UK is scrap surplus. UK exports a lot of scrap, and the greenest way of producing steel today in scale is by recycling scrap. So, why should a country which has scrap and is exporting so much scrap not leverage that and use more scrap in steelmaking. That's what our proposal was. And it helps the UK government also meet the targets on CO2 emissions for the country. Hence, it is not just about supporting a business which is losing money, but about creating a business which is greener and more sustainable, and we believe very important for the industrial supply chain in UK.

The worst case scenario is we don't get the support we seek, and then as and when the assets come to end-of-life, we'll have to close it because you can't run an asset if it's not safe.

How many years before it hits the end-of-life?

Well, different assets are coming to different stages of end-of-life, but clearly in the next two years some of the critical assets, the heavy and the upstream assets, which are coming to end-of-life. The downstream assets are good. They can continue running.

At a macro level, how do you see recessionary fears for US, Europe, a couple of other markets play out in terms of the overall demand for steel, as well as prices this financial year?

Actually, more than what happens anywhere else in the world, what matters is what happens in China, because that's 50 percent of the steel consumption. So, to me if China recovers well, that's good for the industry. But we are conscious that China's moving away from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth. So, the steel intensity of Chinese growth, going forward, will be less than the steel intensity of Chinese growth in the past. We are conscious of that. The US with the Inflation Reduction Act is going to invest a lot of money and that's positive. In the US, prices of hot rolled pipes even today is more than $1,000 a tonne. American steel companies are amongst the most profitable in the world. So, the US is quite strong.

So, if China is strong and the US is strong, these are the two largest economies, that has a huge impact. In Europe, the way I see it, if gas and energy prices settle as they are today, obviously, economic activity will pick up because a lot of industries have been suffering due to high gas and energy prices. If there is any near-term chance of reconstruction in Ukraine, that's again a positive. Inflationary pressures are there and rising interest rates are certainly going to be a dampener from that point of view. For Indian exporters, the fundamentals of these markets are going to be important. But otherwise, for companies that are dependent largely on domestic demand in India, I think, we are on a pretty strong wicket given the fundamentals, given the money being kept aside for expenditure on infrastructure, and given that elections are coming up next year. We expect some of these expenditure to get accelerated.

Give us a little more detailed commentary on China. China did surprise the street in the last three months in terms of lesser-than-expected demand. What is your expectation in terms of China’s impact on raw material costs and steel demand and supply?

China went through a tough year because of the COVID restrictions. When the COVID restrictions were removed in December, there was a lot of positive sentiment, maybe in excess of what needed to be there. Everyone thought it's just going to take off, which it didn't, because China, like I said, is fundamentally making a correction and shifting more to consumption-led growth. So, automotive demand is back to two million cars a month, (that’s) 24 million cars a year. But if you look at construction activity, it is no longer as strong as it was before. The property sector is rebalancing itself. So, you have that kind of a situation playing out in China. Steel production has been very strong.

China has been producing all out. In fact, the March production was probably among the highest. It was about 96 million tonnes, which is among the highest it has done in the recent past. But if coal imports have not been high, that's because China has adjusted itself to domestic coal and other sources of coal beyond Australia, because they have not been buying any Australian coal for the last few years. I think, coal import is more a reflection of the changes that China has made in terms of sourcing coal. I'm sure they're buying a lot of coal from Russia, more coal from Russia than before. Steel production ramped up because everyone was positive about demand.

(But) demand didn't ramp up as much as they expected. And steel exports went up in March to about eight million tonnes, which is higher than what you'd like it to be; five to six million tonnes is fine. Eight-10 million tonnes is not so great. But we expect that to be a temporary phase because China Iron and Steel Association has already requested its members to cut down production as Chinese steel companies are again back to not making any money. And hence, they can't sustain at these prices (or) if they drop prices and try to get the volumes. So, I think, China economically will do reasonably well this year. From the point of view of steel, (it) will do okay. But in the past, if the Chinese economy grew at 5 percent, we'd expect steel consumption to grow at 8-9 percent. That's not going to happen because the structure of the economy has changed. But still I expect China to probably surprise in a positive way during the year.

Take us through your debt reduction plans. And specifically, how do you plan to strategise the cost of capital?

Yeah. After we announced a billion dollar (debt reduction plan) a year, we actually reduced it by about Rs 50,000 crore. So, we did far more than that in three years. Then last year, we acquired Neelachal, and because of coal prices going up from $250 to $650, working capital really sucked in a lot of cash. That's why last year our net debt went up, because Neelachal and Rohit Ferro and some of the other ferro alloy units meant about Rs 10,000-12,000 crore of expenditure more than in a normal year, and then working capital was at least Rs 5,000-6,000 crore more than in a normal year.

That is what is reflected in the net debt going up because we continued with our capex. We spent about Rs 14,000 crore in capex last year, in addition to all this. So, going forward, we are back to the $1 billion goal. And we think in FY24, we are on track to reduce our debt by a billion dollars, because our working capital will be back to normal. The slab stocks that we built up in Europe in anticipation of the blast furnace shutdown will get used. And we don't have a Neelachal kind of situation this year. So, we're not spending that kind of money. The capex will continue to be what it was. So, we are quite confident we will get back to that path on debt reduction.

Any acquisitions on the table for this financial year?

Nothing is planned.

What's the capital expenditure number?

I think, it's about Rs 16,000 crore for the year, Europe and India both put together. India – Rs 12,000 crore, balance would be in Europe, mainly in the Netherlands for the blast furnace steel lining.

One final question. Give us some colour on your India operations. What are you expecting this financial year? How much will it help you cushion all that's happening worldover?

Yeah. Obviously we are expecting this year to be stronger than last year. Last year, we had a standout quarter in terms of Q1. But the other quarters were less than great. Q4 was not bad. But we expect more stable operations this year, hopefully picking up towards the second half of the year as the spend by the governments, both in India and overseas, (return) to track. So, we are expecting volumes also to be higher this year, both India and Europe put together about a million, million-and-a-half tonnes higher than last year, because in India, Neelachal volumes will play out in full for the full year. We will continue to de-bottleneck. And then in Europe, we'll have the blast furnaces running fullout in the second half of the year. And the sentiment in Europe should be better this year than it was last year. So overall, we expect this to be a better quarter unless something very unexpected happens.

And are you expecting a pause in the rate hike cycle?

Yeah, let's see how it goes. I think, inflation has come down. It has come down to below the band. So, I think if we want growth back, maybe another 25 basis points (bps). But I think beyond that, I'm sure the RBI is thinking about it. But given the global kind of situation, we have to really make sure that India demand is strong. All the more reason for us to hope that growth gets a bit more precedence and inflation is under control.",2313,0.2738964871356362

“The assets … cannot survive for long, they are coming to the end of life. We will have to take a call in a year or two,” said TV Narendran, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Tata Steel.

The company has been in discussions with the UK government, seeking financial support for a green transition for its assets. So far, it said, the talks have remained inconclusive.

Tata Steel did not disclose financial details of the package last proposed by the UK government. Media reports have, in the past, pegged it at £600 million for two companies, including Tata Steel UK.

“The progress of discussions with the UK government is also being monitored closely given that based on the initial and subsequent discussions it remains uncertain whether adequate support for the decarbonisation strategy would be agreed,” Tata Steel said in its May 2 note for its March quarter financial results.

“Our proposal was to transition it (the assets) to a greener process and (we are) seeking support from the government for the same. The cash flows of the business do not allow us to fund the transition. The government has come back with a package that is not close to what we are asking, so the conversation is ongoing,” Narendran said in the May 3 interview.

He added that the best-case scenario for the assets would be for the company to receive the package it seeks. “Our fundamental point is that the UK is scrap surplus and exporting. Why should a country not leverage that (scrap) and use it in steelmaking,” he said.

In the worst-case scenario, he added, if there was no package, “...as and when different assets come to end-of-life, we will have to close them. We cannot run an asset if it is not safe. Clearly, in the next two years, some of the critical assets, more of the upstream assets, will come to an end.”

A strong performance by India operations helped Tata Steel beat Street estimates on all fronts. Although Q4 net profit dropped 84 percent to Rs 1,566 crore, it was higher than the analyst expectation of Rs 955 crore.

Revenue from operations for Tata Steel came in at Rs 62,962 crore, down 9.2 percent from Rs 69,323 crore a year ago. The analysts had pegged the revenue at Rs 58,962 crore. Operating margins at 11.5 percent was also higher than the estimate of 9.8 percent.

At 10:30 am, Tata Steel stock was quoting at Rs 109.65, lower by 0.5 percent. The stock is down over 8 percent in 2023 so far.

After the Q4 numbers, JPMorgan gave an 'overweight' rating and a target price of Rs 150 for the stock, while Morgan Stanley and CLSA gave it an 'equal-weight' and 'outperform' rating with target prices of Rs 110 and Rs 125 per share.

According to Morgan Stanley, Tata Steel's standalone EBITDA was much stronger due to better realisations and lower operating expenses. This drove a good beat on a consolidated basis, but the European business continued to struggle and was a significant drag on the overall performance.

The India business generated a margin of 20 percent, while Europe was at 5 percent with higher input costs affecting margins.

JPMorgan has highlighted that the strong performance of Tata Steel's India operations offset the weak European business, resulting in a large beat. They also noted that debt reduction is a positive, and the sharp improvement in India EBITDA per tonne to Rs 16,700 is another positive.

Tata Steel's net debt decreased by around Rs 3,900 crore to Rs 67,810 crore. ""Our liquidity remains strong at Rs 28,688 crore. Net debt to EBITDA was 2.07x,"" the company stated in a press release.

Additionally, JPMorgan believes that the improvement in other Indian operations, including Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (NINL), which is working on a project plan to expand capacity from 1 million tonnes to 5 million tonnes, is also a positive sign.

For CLSA, too, the strong beat in India operations drives the optimism. ""While losses in Europe were in-line, residual EBITDA increased sequentially,"" CLSA said.

Tata Steel on May 2 reported an 84 percent year-on-year drop in its consolidated net profit at Rs 1,566 crore from the quarter ended March 2023. Net profit in the year-ago period stood at Rs 9,835 crore.

While profit dropped 84 percent, it managed to beat Street expectations. Brokerages had estimated a 91 percent drop at Rs 955 crore due to weak performance in the Europe business.

The steelmaker's Q4 revenue from operations came in at Rs 62,962 crore, down 9.2 percent from Rs 69,323 crore in the year-ago period. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell 52 percent YoY to Rs 7,225 crore.

Operating margins contracted to 11.5 percent from 21.7 percent in the year-ago period. However, the company saw strong momentum with deliveries growing by 9 percent sequentially to 5.15 million tons.

""For the full financial year, we saw our India crude steel production growing to around 19.9 million tons, with a 65 percent share of our overall volumes. Deliveries were in line with production with domestic deliveries growing 11 percent YoY and driving product mix improvement,"" TV Narendran, chief executive officer and managing director said.

Tata Steel's net debt decreased by around Rs 3,900 crore to Rs 67,810 crore. ""Our liquidity remains strong at Rs 28,688 crore. Net debt to EBITDA was 2.07x,"" the company stated in a press release.

India business posted strong performance. The segment achieved the highest ever annual crude steel production of 19.88 million tons and highest ever deliveries of 18.87 million tons.

Neelachal Ispat Nigam (NINL) steadily ramped up during the last two quarters and is presently operating with a run rate of 1 million tons (crude steel plus pig iron) on an annualised basis, the company said.

Meanwhile, in the Europe business, inflationary pressures and sustained volatility weighed on steel fundamentals during the year. Concerns about the banking sector in the January– March quarter added to the mix.

It will provide valuable insights into operating blast furnaces with greener fuel injectants, reducing fossil fuel consumption and subsequent CO2 emissions from the blast furnace, the statement said.

Tata Steel said the trial has the potential to reduce the coke rate by 10 per cent, translating into around 7-10 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions per tonne of crude steel produced.

""The trial of hydrogen gas injection in a blast furnace at Jamshedpur Works is an important milestone in our journey towards net zero emissions.

""We are confident that this trial will provide valuable insights into operating blast furnaces with hydrogen and help us identify the next steps towards achieving our goal of a leaner carbon future,"" Uttam Singh, Vice President, Iron Making at Tata Steel, said.",256,0.8897972106933594

Tata Steel Ltd is in talks to raise as much as $400 million, according to people familiar with the matter, in what could become the company’s first green loan.

The debt could have a tenor of about five years and the proceeds would be used for capital expenditure, said the people, who declined to be named because the matter is private. The lenders include Bank of America Corp, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.

No final decision has yet been taken and details may still change, according to the people. Bloomberg-compiled data indicate this would be Tata Steel’s first green loan.

The company did not immediately respond to Bloomberg’s requests for comment.

Steelmaking is carbon intensive and the sector will require fresh financing to improve its environmental footprint. A global shift to low-emissions productions would require outlays of about $4.4 trillion over the next 30 years, according to a 2022 McKinsey Quarterly report.

Tata Steel lags its peers on several environmental metrics, including greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, and water and waste management, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.",194,

The PM Gati Shakti - National Master Plan (NMP) has completed an evaluation of 76 central government key infrastructure projects related to railways, roads and transport, etc. worth Rs 5.14 lakh crore over the past year leading to cost savings, providing the shortest connectivity and minimising intersections with forest cover, a top official of the Commerce Ministry said.

PM Gati Shakti - National Mission Plan, launched on October 13, 2021, is a geographic information system-enabled platform that integrates the data on infrastructure like roads, railway lines, ports, inland waterways, telecom lines and power lines onto a single portal. The NMP platform enables integrated planning for multimodal logistics and supports data-based decision-making.

“We held four meetings to identify the pain points. The fifth meeting on port-related connectivity issues will be held with chairmen of all ports soon,” Sumita Dawra, Special Secretary at Commerce Ministry said in a media briefing.

“So far 22 states have integrated their land records with Gati Shakti - NMP. Also, 14 social sectors ministries/departments have been boarded onto the NMP platform and are in advanced stages of integration to utilise the PM Gatishakti mechanism,” she said.

Using the NMP, 156 infrastructure gaps relating to first and last-mile connectivity issues of major sectors of the economy, such as coal, steel, fertiliser, ports, food and public distribution have been identified by concerned ministries in coordination with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT).

An amount of Rs 75,000 crore (including Rs 15,000 crore from private sources) for 100 critical transport infrastructure projects identified for first and last-mile connectivity has been allocated in Union Budget 2023.

The entire 5G rollout by the Telecom Ministry is taking place using the Gatishakti NMP.

“The availability of existing telecom infrastructure across states among other data layers has helped in expeditious planning of the 5G network. This will enable faster rollout of the network and early availability of 5G services,” Dawra said.

The use of NMP has resulted in cost savings for every project due to better planning based on data layers.

A ‘call before u dig’ mobile application has been developed on the Gatishakti NMP that aims to prevent damage to underlying assets like optical fibre cables because of uncoordinated digging and excavation, leading to a loss of about Rs 3,000 crore every year.

The installation of the Silchar-Jiribam-Imphal natural gas pipeline in Assam-Manipur using the NMP has resulted in a lesser overall length leading to a cost reduction from Rs 1,150 crore to Rs 1,100 crore.

The India-Nepal Haldia border project under Gatishakti NMP has led to minimising intersections with the forest area and the Raniganj coal mine area.

The construction of a broad gauge double line between Sawai Madhopur-Jaipur under Gatishakti has led to total savings in freight trains of Rs 1,104.93 lakh.

The Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) launched under the national logistics policy has been integrated with 33 systems of seven ministries. ULIP enables tracking of all cargo containers, which are exported, or imported, during domestic or international waters.

“So far 76 companies have already signed non-disclosure agreements with ULIP for getting access to data sets. Fifteen more companies are likely to join soon. To date, 57 million cargo containers have been tracked in the last six years. Major industry players like Maruti Suzuki, DHL, UltraTech, TCIL, Tata Steel and Bosch have been onboarded on ULIP,” Abishek Chaudhary, Vice-President of National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation said.",583,0.6613978317805699

Tata Steel is still pursuing its request for the financial package with the UK government, the company's CEO T V Narendran said.

Narendran who is also the Managing Director of Tata Steel made the remarks in reply to a question on stance on exiting the UK business.

""Tata Steel is still pursuing it (request) with the government there (UK),"" he told PTI on the sidelines of an event in the national capital.

There has been no conclusion to the request made for a financial package, he said.

India-headquartered Tata Steel owns the UK's largest steelworks at Port Talbot in South Wales and employs around 8,000 people across all its operations in the country.

The company had sought 1.5 billion pounds from the UK government to execute its decarbonisation plans.

However, the British government earlier this year made a counter offer which was much lower to the company's expectations.

The Indian economy is looking good despite global headwinds because of the focus on infrastructure, Tata Steel managing director TV Narendran has said.

“Globally there is some concern because of the fragility of some of the economies but I think the Indian economy is looking good because of the focus on infrastructure,"" Narendran told CNBC TV-18 on the sidelines of the Indian All India Management Association Awards.

Narendran also sort to draw a link between steel consumption and gross domestic product (GDP) growth. ""Steel consumption in my view should reflect the GDP growth rate, so if the GDP is going to grow at six-and-a-half -seven percent, I expect steel consumption to grow at least that rate,"" the Tata Steel MD said.

He also spoke at length about Tata Steel's growth plans and how the steel-maker planned to five million tonne capacity expansion in the current financial year.

""Our growth will be dependent on the capacities that we build, we are in the middle of a five million tonne expansion, which should be completed during this financial year but we'll get the benefit of that in the next financial year,"" Narendran said.

While Europe continues to be a challenge for the company despite an improvement in conditions, the second half of the year should be “much better”, he said.

""Europe continues to be a bit of a challenge, things have improved because gas prices in Europe and electricity prices in India have come down and steel prices have improved so things are looking better. We have a challenge because we are realigning one of our blast furnaces in Netherlands but we expect the second half of the year to be much better,"" Narendran said.

Representative image

For Tinplate Company of India (TCIL), a subsidiary of Tata Steel, the ongoing capacity expansion at Jamshedpur will help retain its market dominance, and expand product portfolio and export markets, a senior company executive told Moneycontrol in an exclusive chat on April 5.

“We have reached our full capacity after our debottlenecking. So it's the right time to increase capacities,” said RN Murthy, managing director. On April 3, TCIL undertook the ground-breaking ceremony for the expansion project. Under this first phase of expansion, TCIL will raise its capacity to 715,000 tonnes per annum (TPA) from the current 415,000 TPA at Jamshedpur. The Rs 2,000-crore expansion is likely to be completed by 2026.

Murthy pointed out that the expansion is critical to ensure TCIL’s dominant market position in the packaging steel segment. He pegged TCIL’s current market share at a significant 48-50 per cent. TCIL’s overall sales grew 18 percent year-on-year in FY22.

“The market is growing at 6 percent to 7 percent per annum. We also have a very good footprint in the international market. We export 20 to 30 percent of our products, and it's integrated with the downstream strategy of Tata Steel,” Murthy said, explaining the rationale behind the expansion. Tata Steel holds a 74.96 percent share in the company.

In FY22, TCIL exported 20 percent of its output to Europe, West Asia, parts of Africa, Southeast Asia and India’s neighbouring countries.

Murthy expects demand from edible oil and paints companies, followed by the processed foods sector, to drive the 6-7 percent demand growth expectation. A low per capita consumption coupled with the push for sustainability, Murthy said, should help increase demand for packaging steel in India. The demand for the product in India, Murthy said, has moved in tandem with the country’s consumption story, particularly consumer demand for larger quantities.

Commenting on competition from other packaging materials such as paper and plastic that could prove to be cheaper but less sustainable, Murthy said, “(Demand for packaging steel) will depend on how much the brand owners believe that it helps them and how much the Indian consumer is willing to pay for that additional cost.”

Despite the cost difference, Murthy expects the trend for sustainable packaging to rise in India in the long term. “Typically, we have seen that tinplate is better for the bigger pack size and plastic is more competitive for the smaller pack size. But premium products even in smaller pack size abroad use tinplate. India also is also evolving, right? So it will happen but like all other things, it is the question of when. That’s something we track regularly,” he said.",462,0.9388657450675965

The Supreme Court on March 24 dismissed the Securities Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) appeal against Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) setting aside a penalty of Rs 2 lakhs against Bhushan Steel now owned by Tata Steel.

While dismissing the plea, Justice Sanjiv Khanna remarked that it was too small an amount for SEBI to have appealed at the Supreme Court, and questioned the lawyers if SEBI filed the appeal because its ego was hurt.

SEBI’s lawyer tried to convince the court stating that the appeal was filed considering the question of law involved and not just the penalty. The bench was however not convinced by the argument and proceeded to dismiss the case.

In December 2022, SAT set aside SEBI's order to impose a Rs 2 lakh penalty on Bhushan Steel Ltd, now known as Tata Steel BSL Ltd, for disclosure lapses.

Bankruptcy proceedings were initiated against the debt-laden Bhushan Steel Ltd in July 2017. After completing the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP), Bhushan Steel was taken over by Tata Steel Ltd in 2018.

""The impugned order dated 14 February 2022, cannot be sustained and is quashed. However, it would be open to the respondent SEBI to issue a show cause notice for the alleged violation against the entity,"" SAT said in an order passed on December 20.

The ruling comes after an appeal was filed against the Sebi order, levying a Rs 2 lakh fine on Bhushan Steel for not making the requisite disclosure under LODR (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) rules.

It noted that the appellant was found guilty of non-disclosure of the number of investor complaints filed with the stock exchanges on a quarterly basis -- March 2016, September 2018 and December 2018.

Under the rules, a listed entity shall file with the recognised stock exchange(s) on a quarterly basis, within twenty-one days from the end of each quarter, a statement giving the number of investor complaints pending at the beginning of the quarter, those received during the quarter, disposed of during the quarter and those remaining unresolved at the end of the quarter.

However, SAT in its order noted that ""the company had gone into July 2017 under the Insolvency Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and in view of the decision of this tribunal, no penalty can be levied on the new management which came into the picture on May 18, 2018.

""The violation, if any, committed for the quarter ended March 2016, was of the previous management which cannot be imposed upon the new management."" It further noted that the non-disclosure for the quarter ended September 2018 and December 2018 concerned, no charge has been levied against the appellant in the show cause notice and consequently, no penalty can be imposed for this violation, the tribunal said.",461,-0.8336958885192871

Even as Indian metal stocks have underperformed most global peers in 2023 so far, some believe that may be the very reason to be optimistic about the sector. Foreign brokerage firm Jefferies sees the underperformance as a buying opportunity in metals space.

Another reason for Jefferies being optimistic about metal companies is the improving macro-economic situation in China, which is one of the world’s largest metal producers and consumers.

A large section of the market believes that domestic metal manufacturers should see healthy volume growth in the near term, driven by improved participation from key end-user industries, such as infrastructure, construction, consumer durables and automobile.

Jatin Damania, Vice President - Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities, said, “We expect margins to recover further in Q4FY23, after a mild recovery in Q3, led by recent price hike, stable raw material costs and operating leverage”.

Damania sees risk-reward for Tata Steel and NMDC as favourable, which prompts the brokerage house to have a ‘buy’ rating on these stocks while it has an ‘add’ rating on Hindalco Industries.

A spate of corrections sweeping through global markets after worries intensified in the US banking space weighed on the Indian equity markets on March 10, driving the Nifty50 down 1 percent on Friday as well as in the entire last week.

The index managed to defend not only 17,300 but also the 17,400 levels, and closed at 17,413 on Friday, the lowest closing level since March 2. There was formation of a bearish candlestick pattern which somewhat resembles a bearish engulfing pattern on the weekly timeframe, indicating the possibility of weakness going ahead, though there was a hammer kind of pattern formation on the daily scale on Friday, which is generally a bullish reversal pattern.

The 17,300 level is expected to act as a crucial support, followed by the recent swing low of 17,250 and if the said levels get broken, then there could be correction up to the 17,000 mark, whereas on the higher side, 17,600-17,700 could be critical hurdles for further up-move towards the psychological 18,000 mark, experts said.

""Friday's low around 17,320 would be seen as an immediate support followed by sacrosanct support at February's swing low of 17,250. On the flip side, the bearish gap left around 17,570–17,600 should be considered an immediate hurdle,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

Instead of swaying on both sides of the trend, he advised that traders should ideally prefer staying light on positions and keep accumulating quality propositions in a staggered manner.

The weak global cues and underperforming heavyweights, especially Reliance Industries, were major culprits in dragging the markets down. Going ahead, it would be crucial to keep a close tab on them as any positive development globally can elevate the overall sentiment, Sameet Chavan said.

Ajit Mishra, VP - Technical Research at Religare Broking said that while most of the sectors are trading in line with the benchmark, the performance of banking and financials would continue to play a key role in deciding the next directional move. Stay focused on stock selection and risk management, he advised.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the March 10 closing prices:

Expert: Viraj Vyas, Technical & Derivatives Analyst - Institutional Equity at Ashika Stock Broking

Linde India: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,015 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,800 | Target: Rs 4,450 | Return: 11 percent

The stock has been forming an ascending triangle pattern since April last year and broke out with volumes in the last few sessions. Post the strong breakout, the stock opened gap up and despite ongoing volatility, the stock continues to sustain higher which indicates buyer Strength.

Post such an extended consolidation breakout, the stock appears to have a price objective of atleast of 1,000 rupees rally from the breakout level which provides a favourable risk-reward opportunity.

GAIL India: Buy | LTP: Rs 111 | Stop-Loss: Rs 103 | Target: Rs 125 | Return: 13 percent

The oil and gas space is a sector which has been in a broader consolidation since almost 2 years with bouts of strengths and weakness.

Looking at weekly chart, the stock has closed at the higher threshold of the consolidation of almost 2 years. The breakout was assisted with strong volumes and such breakout after elongated consolidation usually results in sharp up move.

NCC: Buy | LTP: Rs 99 | Stop-Loss: Rs 90 | Target: Rs 120 | Return: 21 percent

The weekly chart of the strong depicts a Cup and Handle pattern formed over a period of around 4 years which depicts massive accumulation.

The stock has also closed above the previous swing high (Rs 95-level) which indicates seller exhaustion. The stock broke above the neckline last week with above average volume and continues to be resilient in turbulent market which depicts buyer strength.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Persistent Systems: Sell | LTP: Rs 4,749 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,000 | Target: Rs 4,400 | Return: 7 percent

The stock is diverging negatively on the daily charts. During the pullback trend, the stock managed to surpass its previous peak, however, the key oscillators failed to gain momentum. Such a type of formation invites correction.

The strategy should be to sell at the current level of Rs 4,750 and the rest at Rs 4,900. For that put the stop-loss at Rs 5,000. On the downside, the stock may slide towards Rs 4,500 & Rs 4,400 levels.

ICICI Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 843 | Stop-Loss: Rs 855 | Target: Rs 800 | Return: percent

The stock is forming an ascending triangle, which is a bullish consolidation for the stock, however, it has broken its support due to sudden weakness in the market. It is suggesting a correction in the near term.

In such cases most of the time the stock falls to the starting point of the formation which is at Rs 800. The stock may fall down 5 percent from the current levels, which is a decent downside. Sell is recommended at current levels and above Rs 850. For this, keep the stop-loss at Rs 855.

Tata Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 108 | Stop-Loss: Rs 100 | Target: Rs 125 | Return: 16 percent

It is making a higher bottom at Rs 103.50 as compared to Rs 100, which was its previous low. The entire basket of steel stocks reversed sharply in the past week.

In fact, for the past two weeks, the stock has been facing buying pressure whenever it has declined. It is relatively outperforming other sectors and also stocks from the metal baskets.

A buy is recommended at current levels and at Rs 104. For that, keep a stop-loss at Rs 100. On the upside, it has the potential to move higher towards Rs 115 or Rs 125 in the medium term.

Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

RBL Bank March Future: Sell | LTP: Rs 155.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 165 | Target: Rs 143 | Return: 8 percent

After witnessing a sharp weakness in January month, the stock price has shifted into a broader high low range movement within Rs 170-150 levels. Presently, the stock price is placed at the edge of breaking below the crucial lower support at Rs 150 levels-weekly 20-period EMA (exponential moving average).

The overall chart pattern indicates a formation of important top at Rs 189 in January month and there is a higher chance of further weakness emerging in coming week.

Volume has started to expand during downside breakout in the stock price and weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) shows negative indication. Hence, one may expect further strengthening of downside momentum in the stock price ahead.

One may look to create short position in RBL Bank March Future at CMP (Rs 155.10), add more on rise up to Rs 161, wait for the downside target of Rs 143 in the next 2 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 165.

Oracle Financial Services Software: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,242 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,025 | Target: Rs 3,480 | Return: 7 percent

The attached weekly timeframe chart of the IT stock - Oracle Financial Services Software (OFSS) indicates a sustainable upside bounce in the last few weeks.

We observe a formation broader triangle pattern (converging up and down trend lines), which is unfolding over the last few months.

The stock price is now in an attempt of upside breakout of the triangle at Rs 3,230-3,250 levels. Hence, a sustainable move above this hurdle is expected to bring strong upside momentum for the stock price ahead.

The negative chart pattern like lower tops and bottoms (during November 21 to October 22) seems to have been completed as per weekly chart and the stock price has started to move up as per the positive pattern like higher tops and bottoms recently. This is positive indication.

One may look to buy OFSS at CMP (Rs 3,245), add more on dips down to Rs 3,120 and wait for the upside target of Rs 3,480 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 3,025.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Hindustan Petroleum Corporation: Buy | LTP: Rs 230 | Stop-Loss: Rs 222 | Target: Rs 244 | Return: 6 percent

The stock witnessed a buying interest in the week gone by and showed a relative outperformance in last couple of sessions inspite of selling pressure seen in the broader markets.

The RSI oscillator has given a positive crossover indicating a positive momentum while the prices have also surpassed its ’20 DEMA’ hurdle.

We expect the momentum to continue in the near term and hence, traders can buy the stock in the range of Rs 227-230 for potential short term targets of Rs 238 and Rs 244. The stop-loss on long positions should be placed below Rs 222.

Polycab India: Sell | LTP: Rs 2,947 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,050 | Target: Rs 2,840 | Return: Rs 4 percent

The stock has seen a decent upmove in last couple of months and the momentum readings were in the overbought zone. In Friday's session, the prices breached its ‘20 DEMA’ support and the RSI oscillator also gave a negative crossover.

The volumes were also relatively good along with the price correction and hence, the stock could see further correction in the short term.

Traders are advised to sell the stock on pullback moves around Rs 2,980-3,000 for potential near term targets of Rs 2,900 and Rs 2,840. The stop-loss for short positions should be placed above Rs 3,050.

The Tata Group is celebrating the 184th birth anniversary of its founder Jamsetji Tata today. Born on March 3, 1839, Jamsetji Tata is regarded as the “Father of Indian Industry.” His date of birth is observed as Founder’s Day within the Tata Group, which he founded as a private trading firm in 1868. His vision inspired the steel and power industries in India, set the foundation for technical education, and helped the country leapfrog into the ranks of industrialised nations, the Tata Group writes on its website.

On Jamsetji Tata’s 184th birth anniversary, here’s a look at how the ideas of a visionary changed the world around him.

Man of steel



Jamsetji Tata is best known for setting up the Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) in Jamshedpur. The idea of setting up an iron and steel plant in India was born when Tata visited Manchester in UK. TISCO started pig iron production in 1911 and began producing steel in 1912.

“When India relied on others for steel, one man envisioned a nation standing on its own feet,” the Tata Group wrote in an Instagram post on the occasion of Jamsetji Tata’s birth anniversary.

India’s first planned industrial city



Jamshedpur, established by Jamsetji Tata, is regarded as the first planned city of India. Named after the founder of Tata Group, Jamshedpur in Jharkhand houses Tata Steel, the oldest steel plant of India.

Jamsetji Tata envisioned it as a city of public leisure spaces with well-planned infrastructure. “Be sure that there is plenty of space for lawns and gardens. Reserve large areas for football, hockey and parks,” he had said.

The visionary who saw clean power in a waterfall



The idea of harnessing waterfalls for clean energy first struck Jamsetji Tata during a picnic by Roha creek in Maharashtra. This was as a time when Mumbai was choking on the fumes of the boilers of textile mills. Tata envisioned setting up one of the first hydroelectric power plants in the Western Ghats, one that could harness water to provide electricity, but he died before work on his vision could be completed.

“Though he could not personally accomplish this tough task, Jamsetji’s sons Dorab and Ratan subsequently laid the foundation for affordable and clean power for the city of Bombay,” the Tata Group writes on its website.

The ‘lighthouse’ that guides Tata Group



Jamsetji Tata left behind a legacy that few can hope to replicate. He is today remembered as a visionary who saw potential where others couldn’t.

Ratan Tata, Chairman Emeritus of Tata Sons, remembered Jamsetji Tata on his birth anniversary in 2020 as “the lighthouse that guides us long after his business and philanthropic legacy helped build the nation.” He said that Jamsetji created a culture of kindness and empathy in the company that lives on even today.",481,0.8522520661354065

The latest offer from the UK government to aid decarbonisation efforts of steelmakers is not enough and Tata Steel remains in discussions with them, the steel maker said.

In an interview with Moneycontrol on February 7, TV Narendran, chief executive officer and managing director of Tata Steel said: “We have given them (UK government) a proposal. They got back with a counterproposal. So, let's see where it ends. So, we are in discussion.”

According to foreign media reports, the UK government made a 600-million-pound package proposal for incentivizing green steel for two steel-making companies that operate in the country. Tata Steel is one of the two companies, which operates a steel plant in Port Talbot in South Wales.

On whether the quoted 600-million-pound package is enough, Narendran said, “Well, it's obviously less than what we've asked for. So, we are in a conversation with the government to see what can be done because we feel that the steel industry should be a very important part of the transition plan for the UK government.”

Tata Steel owns the UK's largest steelworks at Port Talbot in South Wales and employs around 8,000 people across all its operations in the country. The company had sought 1.5 billion pounds from the UK government to execute its decarbonisation plans.

When asked if Tata Steel is optimistic of a more favourable package, Narendran added, “Well, we've been pursuing with the government for the last three years and we're glad that there's some progress being made now.”",289,0.1128305196762085

Tata Steel’s Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director T.V. Narendran spoke about the company’s loss of Rs 2,224 crore in the quarter ended December 2022. In an interview with Moneycontrol, Narendran attributed a significant portion of the loss to the UK pension fund-related deferred tax adjustments. Edited excerpts:

First, take us through the numbers and what the Street is calling a surprise loss of Rs 2,200+ crore. What has led to this loss? Is the fourth quarter looking better?

If you look at our Q3 numbers, you know, the India business has continued to improve, though the prices in Q3 were lower than the prices in Q2 by about ₹2,000 per ton, but the costs were also lower because there was a $90 reduction per ton in coking coal costs. So that has a big impact on the input costs. So overall, you saw margin expansion in India. I think the challenge was in Europe for multiple reasons. One is, if you see in Europe, demand and prices have continued to drop. In Q3, the realizations were about £160 per ton lower than in Q2. While the input costs had come down, like in India, because the coking coal cost have dropped by about $90 a ton, iron ore prices have dropped by about $20 a ton.

But we have had high value stocks from Q2 where we took an NRV (Net Realisable Value) loss. And that resulted in overall costs going up actually about £31 per ton in Europe. So you had a drop in realisations and an increase in cost because of the NRV loss that we booked. So that was a part of the losses that you saw. But 70 percent of the loss that we reported for the last quarter was largely because of the pension fund adjustment. We are trying to de-risk the pension funds. It's going over to insurance companies because that's the better thing to do. Over the long term, we are de-risking the company from pension issues. But as we do that, there is a deferred tax credit, which is lying in our books and that gets adjusted. And so most of the Rs.2,500 odd crore loss that you saw is because of the deferred tax adjustment that we made last quarter. It's a non-cash adjustment.

Are you expecting more of this in the coming quarters?

Yeah. So as of now, what we've done is about 60 percent of the pension has gone to the insurance companies. We have 40 percent left, which we will do in the first half of next year. So there will be some more adjustments maybe in Q1 of next year, as we do the rest. But we believe that structurally this is the right thing to do, and in the long term, the company would be in better shape as we insure all the pension liabilities that we have.

How are demand and costs in Europe shaping up?

The operating performance in Europe will improve this quarter compared to the last quarter. Volumes will be higher. The prices will be lower this quarter, but the cost will be even lower because we will not have the NRV adjustment that we made last year. So we are expecting the prices to be lower by about £70 per ton this quarter compared to last quarter. Though the spot prices have gone up, our long-term contract prices are lower. But we are seeing the costs go down by at least about £100 per ton. So margin expansion in this quarter may not be enough fully to cover the negative EBITDA(Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation) that we had, but we're still working on it. The volumes will be higher in Europe this quarter compared to the previous quarter.

When you spoke to us a few weeks back in Davos, you mentioned you expected Q2 to be the worst one for India and Q3 to be worse for Europe. That does that stand? And are we seeing better times for the next few quarters?

Absolutely… we knew that the worst was behind us in India by then and we knew the worst was Q3 in Europe. So that's exactly how it has played out.

And how does demand look for steel, both domestic and export-wise, especially the fact that we don't have the export duty in place now? So how does that pan out for the company?

The international markets are basically watching what's happening in China. A lot of the activity in the steel industry in the last four weeks has been because of the opening up of China. So we expect that the Chinese demand will not shrink. Let's put it that way. If GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is going to grow at 5 percent, steel consumption cannot be shrinking, right, that is one. Secondly, globally, the World Steel Association forecast for steel consumption growth is about 1 percent to 2 percent – largely led by India, Southeast Asia, Middle East, Africa, etc. And in that assumption, the Chinese growth of steel consumption is assumed at 0 percent. So anything which happens in China is only going to add to that. International prices have gone up, like I said, and hence, export opportunities are available for Indian exporters. We ourselves booked orders that maybe $100 higher than what we'd booked maybe two months back. But having said that, from a Tata Steel point of view, always 85 percent or more of our steel production is sold in India. So we'll continue to do that. Exports have never been more than 10 percent to 15 percent of what we produce. But as an industry, I think the Indian companies will leverage the opportunities that there are to export to Europe, to the Middle East and to other countries. So I see far more exports this year, thanks to the export duty being removed, than we saw last year.

And would you like to put a percentage for your India operations? How much of that would be exports?

Like I said, not more than 15 percent. I think it will be in the 10 percent to 15 percent range. We would export to some of the markets where we have kind of a strategic presence… if there's an inventory buildup in any kind of product, then we will look at (that) – ‘can we use export markets to reduce the pressure on inventory.’ But currently, I see India demand is quite strong. I don't see any problem with inventories in India. So I don't see us exporting more than maybe 12 percent to 13 percent.

And take us through your capital expenditure numbers. Your press release mentions ₹3,632 crore spent in the December quarter. So at what number do you end the current financial year and what would be the target for the next financial year?

So what we have guided (for) is (that) our capex will be about Rs 12,000 to 13,000 crore. It will be at that level. Eighty percent or more of it will go to India. A lot of it is going to the Kalinganagar expansion which is at its final stages. So next year's guidance will also be clearly in that range. We will look at our projections on cash flows and decide, because we also have deleveraging goals and then we will balance our deleveraging goals with our capex and other requirements for cash.

And would some of this be towards Neelachal Ispat in the next financial year? Any expansion that we see starting there?

So what's happening in Neelachal is we're focused in the last six months to get the plant started. It was closed for close to three years. I'm happy to report that pretty much all the operations in Neelachal, except the coke ovens, which will start in July, are functional. In fact, yesterday we had the highest ever production in Neelachal at 3,000 tons, so that's the rated capacity – 3,200 tons. So we are producing at a million tons a year kind of level. Beyond this, taking it from 1 million to 5 million will take two to three years. In the next six months, we will go to the board with our proposal. And once we get that cleared, we will expand that. But not much money needs to be spent on Neelachal next year. Whatever we needed to spend, we spend this year to get the plan started.

So not a huge capex coming there for the next financial year or so?

No. Most of the capex in India will be for Kalinganagar because the project is coming. The cold rolling mill is ready. The pellet plant is ready. The other facilities will get ready over the next 12 to 14 or 12 to 18 months. So a lot of the capex spend will be there, as well as to expand our raw materials, because to keep pace with our steel consumption growth or steel production growth, we also want to expand our mining activity so that we can feed the iron ore for our steel plant.

Take us through that plan of expanding on the raw material side. What are you looking at both domestically and internationally?

So, we have iron ore production largely in India. We have a small mine in Canada. But most of our iron ore mining activity is focused on India. We are already producing close to 35 million tons. We will continue to grow this. We produced basically for our own requirements. And the plan is over the next few years to take it from 35 million tons to about 60 million tons as we grow our steelmaking capacity. So we will keep pace with our capacity expansion in steel.

So these would be acquisitions or would this be through mining leases?

Existing mines. All are existing mines. We already acquired a few mines. One is by participating in the auction, as well as we got mines when we acquired Neelachal. We got mines when we acquired Usha Martin. And we got mines when we acquired Bhushan Steel. So we have those mines as well to develop which are already producing, all of them; at least two of them, which is the Neelachal mine and the Usha Martin mine, are already in production. The Bhushan Steels mine – we have just got all the clearances and will start production soon.

This quarter?

Not this quarter. It will take some time because it's a mine which has not been operational. We've just got all the clearances. So sometime next year, we will probably start.

So moving to your UK business, two questions. There are news reports of UK Government considering a £600 million package for incentivizing green steel (steel that’s manufactured without the use of fossil fuels) for the two steel makers there, you being one of them. How do you see that package? Is that enough for you to go ahead with that green steel plan?

Well, it's obviously less than what we've asked for. So we are in a conversation with the government to see what can be done because we feel that the steel industry should be a very important part of the transition plan for the UK government. We also think the steel industry plays a very important role in the manufacturing ecosystem in UK. But obviously, any transition plan, whether in UK or in the rest of Europe, has to have enough support from the government so that it's a viable plan. And I think that's a conversation we're having with the government. We have given them a proposal. They got back with a counterproposal. So let's see where it ends. So we are in discussion.

Are you optimistic on that being addressed in there?

Well, we've been pursuing with the government for the last three years and we're glad that there's some progress being made now.

And how do you see this green steel discussion back home in India?

I think it's a very important journey in India, because one thing to be kept in mind is a lot of steel capacity which is going to come up in the next 10 years or 15 years is going to come up in India. Okay. So, most of the countries are not adding incremental capacity. They may be replacing capacity with new facilities, right? Incremental capacity is coming up in India. Secondly, most of the capacity is coming up in eastern India. So there are only two ways to make green steel. One is you either melt scrap and make steel, which Tata Steel has already started doing with the plant that we are building in Ludhiana. But there's only that much scrap available in the country and the operational expenses on that also depends on energy costs. The second way of making green steel is to substitute coal with gas or gas with hydrogen, right? We are a few years away from availability of hydrogen. Gas also, while it's available in India, not much gas is available in eastern India.

So we need to build the capability or the infrastructure to supply new steel plants coming up in eastern India with gas, so that they can make the process choices. You know, they can choose gas-based steel making instead of coal-based steelmaking. So I think there needs to be a more coordinated effort between industry and the government. If you look at Europe, there are also incentives. There is a carbon price that we pay, which acts as an incentive to emit less carbon. So there is also a carbon border adjustment mechanism coming up to protect industries from imports of carbon and efficient steel. So I think a number of things need to come together, and we are in discussion with the government so that on a more holistic way we can plan this.

One final question, if you could wrap the next financial year for us in terms of what are the challenges you see on the demand side… What are the opportunities you see on the demand side? And what kind of capacity commissioning are you expecting from Tata Steel? And debt reduction plans?

So I'll answer the last one first. I think the debt reduction journey continues. We had three years back said that we are committed to reducing (debt by) at least a billion dollars a year. So we are committed to that. We missed it this year, but the commitment is there and we will plan to do that next year. That's one. The second part is, you know, overall, I see the India business continuing to grow from strength to strength. We had a difficult few quarters because of export duty and high coal prices. But that's behind us. Demand is also coming back quite strongly. Our capacity expansion, which is a 5-million-ton expansion in Kalinganagar, different facilities will get commissioned at different points in time. Like I said, the cold rolling mill and pellet plant are ready, and many of the other facilities will start getting commissioned, but you will get the full benefit of volume only in the next, not in FY24, but more in FY25.

In the next two years, we plan to complete our electric arc furnace-based facility in Ludhiana. Next year, we will get the benefit of Neelachal running full out. This year, you know, we've got the benefit only in the last quarter. We will also, through de-bottlenecking, get some additional volumes in all our sites. So I'm very positive over the India growth story. I'm very positive on Tata Steel's performance in India over the next year. Europe – we have some challenges, but I see Europe next year stabilizing because gas prices and energy prices would have settled down, and hopefully some of the demand will come back because if China opens up and recovers, a lot of economies in Europe stand to benefit because they export a lot to China, particularly countries like Germany. So I'm expecting Europe, also as a geography, to have a better year next year, and hopefully, we'll be able to derive some benefits out of that strategy.",2710,0.13302348668758684

Amid positive sentiment revolving around metal companies on the back of China reopening in 2023, Tata Steel has soured the mood of the Street by skidding into the red in the third quarter.

The steelmaker reported a surprise consolidated net loss of Rs 2,223.84 crore for the quarter ended December 2022, against a profit of Rs 9,572.67 crore a year back. Revenue from operations fell 6.08 percent on year to Rs 57,083.56 crore from Rs 60,783.11 crore.

At 9:45 am, the stock was quoting Rs 113.95 apiece, lower by 3 percent amid heavy trading volumes of 35.5 million shares on the NSE. The stock has gained 6 percent in the past six months.

British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) with Tata Steel UK as sponsor completed a substantial part of its de-risking journey with 60 percent of its liabilities insured in Q3, which was the reason behind the loss, the Tata Group firm informed.

The buy-in transaction resulted in a non-cash deferred tax expense of Rs 1,783 crore and increased the overall deferred tax expense for the quarter to Rs 2,150 crore.

""In India, steel prices were subdued even as raw material costs moved lower,"" said Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer, Tata Steel. ""While this increased margins at standalone operations from around 16 percent in Q2 to 18 percent in Q3, European operations witnessed margin compression due to lower realisations and elevated input costs.""

Net debt of the company now stands at Rs 71,706 crore, with Net Debt to EBITDA at 1.76x.

Here's what brokerage are saying about the stock after the Q3 setback:

CLSA

The brokerage house maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock with target at Rs 135 per share.

“Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amoritzation) was largely in-line with our estimate, but adjusted EBITDA was much lower,” it noted. The steel major’s consolidated EBIDTA stood at Rs 4,047 crore for the quarter.

Sequential improvement in earnings was lower than peers and EBITDA per tonne for Europe fell on sequential basis to negative $95 a tonne, it said.

Jefferies

The firm has a 'buy' rating on the stock with target at Rs 150 per share.

“EBITDA fell sequentially and was below estimates led by weak margins in Europe. However, standalone EBITDA/tonne rose, which was the first improvement after five quarters of decline,” it said.

Net debt was flat quarter-on-quarter.

Morgan Stanley

It has an equal-weight rating with a target price of Rs 110 per share.

Consolidated EBITDA slightly better than our estimates, and large deferred tax expenses towards BSPS drove net loss of Rs 2,200 crore, it noted.

Tata Steel is expected to report a 12.6 percent dent in revenue sequentially and 13.9 percent annually at Rs 52,352 crore in the quarter ended December 2022, according to a poll of brokerage firms conducted by Moneycontrol.

Axis Securities is of the view that the fall in revenues will be led by lower HRC prices in India and Europe QoQ and YoY. It sees margins improving sequentially dragged by lower coking coal costs at Indian operations, partially offset by higher energy costs in Europe.

Kotak Institutional Equities has estimated steel realisation to decline by 2.2 percent QoQ and 11.9 percent YoY owing to price cuts and contract resets during the reporting quarter. It expects standalone volumes to increase by 9.8 percent YoY but fall 2 percent QoQ to 4.67 million tons on a low base.

Axis Securities sees the Tata Goup company's operating margin at 10.6 percent as compared to 26.1 percent in the corresponding period last year and 10.1 percent in the previous quarter.

India EBITDA per tonne would recover by 54 percent QoQ to Rs 12,495 per tonne, down 56 percent YoY, led by lower coal costs, partly offset by lower realisations.

EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation And Amortisation) at Indian operations are likely to increase QoQ due to lower coking coal costs which will be partially offset by lower EBITDA at Europe led by higher energy costs, Axis Securities added.

The company's net profit could tank by 88 percent YoY and 24.3 percent QoQ to Rs 1,146 crore in the quarter under review, as per the poll.

Kotak Institutional Equities estimates Europe to report an EBITDA loss of $63 per tonne led by significant drop in prices and weak demand resulting in adverse product mix, partly offset by lower costs.

Indian steel prices witnessed a marginal fall in December. The key event during December was imposition of anti-dumping duty on seamless tubes and pipe imports from China for five years.

“The immediate near-term looks weak for steel companies,” said IDBI Capital Markets & Securities.

Chinese HRC has fallen by 23 percent while domestic prices have fallen only 15 percent in the past one year. While in December, Indian steel prices fell by 3 percent MoM as global sentiment remained sluggish but Chinese steel prices rose 6 percent.

IDBI Capital Markets & Securities believes that there are chances of recessionary environment in developed countries in the coming one year. Even Chinese economy has weakened due to imposition of lock downs in various parts of the country lately, it added.",424,-0.546601825290256

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech on Wednesday announced that the government has increased capital expenditure for FY24 by 33 percent to Rs 10 lakh crore, amounting to 3.3 percent of India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Narendran mentioned that the focus on railways is very crucial as it is often considered that the railways could be a big bottleneck for growth. The government has in the Union Budget allocated the highest-ever capital outlay at Rs 2.4 lakh crore for the railways, which is about 24 percent of the total capex outlay.

Tata Steel blipped aloud on traders’ radar on January 18 on the back of upbeat trading in metals. The stock zoomed along with a spike in open interest, giving a clear indication of a bullish setup.

This comes amid commentary from CLSA that the said outlook for steel stocks has improved.

“A faster reopening in China and stimulus have provided a new lease of life for the sector, although on-ground demand improvement is still elusive,” CLSA said. “US recession now looks imminent but could be shallower than earlier expectations. While domestic demand is resilient, large steel capacity addition could keep dependence on exports high.”

The broker expects steel prices to rise in the near term (in line with or at a discount to import parity) before softening in the following quarters.

TV Narendran, MD, Tata Steel, said that following a tough second quarter in the domestic market and equally tough third quarter in Europe, the company sees better times now. Its India business has seen a margin improvement, while the European steel market too is swinging into the green, according to him.

The positive commentary helped the stock zoom 3 percent to Rs 122.40 as of 12.30am. It has seen some demand recently, leading to a 10 percent rise in last month and 35 percent over the last six months.

Massive Put writing was seen at 120 strikes, indicating that the market sees it as a new support for the stock. Meanwhile, Calls were being written at 122 and 123 strikes. Overalls, open interest rose by 7 percent on January 18.

Manish Shah, a Sebi-registered investment advisor and a trader, said there was intraday trading opportunity in Tata Steel.

Analysts also attributed some of the gains in the stock to upcoming Union Budget. Usually, metal and mining sectors keep bussing ahead of the Union Budget and traders expect some announcements.

The top official also indicated that the third quarter was toughest for the European steel market, but is now witnessing signs of improvement. Narendran spoke to Moneycontrol’s Chandra Srikanth at Davos, discussing global supply shortages, steel demand, acquisitions and deleveraging plans.

Give us a sense of the mood at Davos this time around—is it very pessimistic or are people hopeful of a pickup and uptake in China since they've opened up the economy now. What trends are you picking up?

It's been a bit of a mixed bag. If you talk to all the Indian delegates who are here, everyone's optimistic and rightly so. If you talk to the Europeans, they are quite pessimistic. The Americans are also waiting to see how long inflation will stay, but I think America has always displayed tremendous resilience and I expect it to bounce back. To me, the positives have been China. I've been hearing a lot of good stuff coming out of China. You know, over the last two, three years, I understand the savings rate in China was about 35 percent, compared to the 25 percent which is normal for them. And there's an expectation that all that will come into the consumption economy as well as into the travel economy. I'm told the requests to travel out of China on travel platforms are growing at three-digit rates, which is like more than 100 percent growth. So there's an enormous amount of pent-up demand, which is probably going to come out of China despite all the challenges they're facing. And that gives me a little bit more optimism than when I came to Davos. Japan has also been a fairly good story. So I think you're seeing many major economies also looking optimistic.

There are concerns that India's economic growth may slow down, hit by global supply shortages as well as high input costs. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is also expected to stay hawkish given the elevated inflation. So given the confluence of these factors, what's your view on how this can impact the steel industry?

You know, even if you look at inflation in India, I think the worst is behind us. I think the last couple of months things have started dipping. Also, the inflation that we've seen is not something you've not seen in the past. I think if you look at the developed world, they have not seen this kind of inflation for a long time. So I think in India, things are a bit more under control than we've seen in the past and I think things will get better. As far as the steel industry is concerned, there are two factors. One is the demand side. And I think the demand side is strong because of the government's continued focus on infrastructure. I think that will continue because you have the elections next year as well. So the government will be keen to complete a lot of the projects that they've started. On the supply side, the cost pressures are there, because coking coal costs have been trending up. Iron ore prices have been going up, again reflecting what's happening in China. So there will be cost pressures on the steel industry, because as you saw from the numbers, most steel companies are not making money. And, hence, there's not much room to go down further. And even if you see in China, in the last four weeks, steel prices have gone up by almost $100. So I'm quite positive over the prospects of the industry over the next few quarters.

And what is the global steel outlook?

We certainly are seeing steel prices go up in Southeast Asia, it's up at least $70 to $80. Domestic prices in China are up $100. In Europe, price increases have been sought. But in Europe, the fundamentals are still a bit weak. But good news is gas prices have been dropping. While it doesn't seem so, this is seen as a warmer winter than normal. But I think that's positive…

So gas prices are settling in Europe. And I think the worst of the crisis, as far as Europe is concerned on gas, is behind them.

While we've seen a demand uptick, prices have still remain muted. Do you expect that to change? What's your outlook as far as prices are concerned?

As you may have seen, steel prices have been going up in India for the last couple of weeks, partly driven by demand, because January to June is typically the peak season for steel consumption. So we're seeing that kicking in. And secondly, steel companies, like I said, have pretty much reached the bottom as far as prices are concerned. So over the last month, I think steel prices both in flat and long products have gone up around Rs 3,000-5,000, but it's still at levels which are much lower than what we saw one year back.

The bet profit for the first six months of FY23 was significantly lower than a year ago. How is the year panned out so far for you? And how do you expect to close the current fiscal?

I think what we have guided in the past was that Q2 in some sense for India was the toughest quarter because you have the confluence of high coking coal prices and low steel prices. Things started improving, margin expansion started happening in Q3, not as much as we expected, but it will continue. So I see the India side continuing to do better quarter on quarter. Europe probably will have its toughest quarter in Q3 because that's when the demand was most fragile and the costs were not any lower. But I'm seeing things starting to improve in Europe as well.

I think you mentioned that de-leveraging your balance sheet is one of your priorities. How do you see that panning out? Again, how will the debt figures look by the end of FY23?

I wouldn't give a guidance on the specific debt figures for the end of the year yet. But I think what we were committed to about three, four years back is at least $1 billion of deleveraging every year. We did more than that in the last few years. This year, of course, it's challenging because of gas prices in Europe, coal prices, working capital. In fact, working capital has taken in a lot of money. We also bought Neelachal (Ispat, the government-owned steel unit in Odisha that had been idled) for about Rs 12,000 crore. So this year, I don't know if we are going to have that deleveraging. But the commitment to deleveraging continues.

Since you brought up Neelachal, you completed the acquisition and restarted operations at the unit in October. How much do you need to invest to get this unit in shape? And by when do you expect to reap the full benefits?

We pretty much got the operations going within three months. You know, they were closed for almost three years. So that was a great work done by the team. We didn't have to spend so much capex to get it going to this level, and we'll take it to a million tonnes (per annum output) a year without much capex, maybe Rs 200-300 crore, that's more to take care of spares and things like that. The major capex will happen after this.

Will you be open to doing more acquisitions? What kind of appetite do you have? Or from here on is it going to be more organic, sort of doubling down on the acquisitions that you've already made?

You know, with the assets that we have in our portfolio today, we can realise our growth ambitions for the next 5 to 10 years because we are today producing about 20 million tonnes in India, going through with an expansion of 5 million in Kalinganagar that takes us to 25, and between Kalinganagar, Angul, the Neelachal site and Jamshedpur, we can easily go to 45 to 48 million tonnes. We have enough land in our existing sites to do that. Having said that, obviously, any opportunity will be looked at on a case-to-case basis, but we are in a stronger position because we can realise our growth ambitions even without doing any inorganic growth, but whether we will do it or not, we'll decide later.",1421,-0.024660175496881657

The metal index added over a percent and outperformed all other indices in the morning session on the first trading day of the new year on January 2. Nifty metal was up 1.5 percent at 09:50am after Jefferies turned positive on the sector.

The global research firm, after remaining cautious on the Indian steel sector and then turning positive, and has upgraded Tata Steel and Hindalco Industries to 'buy' from 'hold'. It has Tata Steel as the top pick.

Jefferies believes that the worst-margin quarter for the steel sector, and the big chunk of earnings cuts for Tata Steel and Hindalco Industries are behind. ""Tata Steel's price to book (PB) and enterprise value (EV) are close to its long-term averages, which we find attractive amid its improving asset footprint and balance sheet,"" it said.

""China has unveiled a comprehensive plan to support the property markets, and has set a new direction for the Covid policy to stabilise the economy which, along with other stimulus measures, should drive a recovery in metal demand in 2023. Weakening US and EU macro poses a risk to the global metal demand, but a potential improvement in China and strong demand in India could provide an offset,"" the research firm said.

Catch all the market action on our live blog

""If the US Fed rate hikes slow as CPI decelerates, and if China continue to relax Covid restrictions, then the cyclical bottom in metals might be close, if not behind,"" it added.

Big earnings cuts for Tata Steel, Hindalco behind

""We believe Indian steel margins for Tata Steel and Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) after falling for the last five quarters, should improve as steel price holds up while the benefit of lower coking coal cost flows through. For Hindalco, Novelis margins are likely to worsen in H2 FY23, but already factored in our estimates. We had cut FY23-24 EPS for Tata Steel, Hinalco, JSPL by 15-80 percent over January-November, but believe the big downgrades are behind,"" Jefferies said in its report.

Valuations most attractive for Tata Steel

Jefferies finds Tata Steel attractive on valuations with the stock trading at its long-term average PB and EV/IC multiples of 1.0x despite higher ROE (10-13 percent in FY24-25E against 8 percent long-term average), rising share of higher-margin India business in volumes and continued deleveraging.

Hindalco is also reasonably priced at 1.1x FY24 PB (11-12 percent FY24-25 ROE) and 1.1x FY24 EV/IC against long-term average of 0.8x PB (9 percent RoE) and 0.9x EV/IC. However, we find JSPL expensive at 2.4x FY24 PB (12-13 percent FY24-25 RoE) and 1.6x FY24 EV/IC against long-term average of 1.5x PB (12 percent RoE) and 1.1x EV/IC, the brokerage firm said in the report.

Time to Buy

We turned cautious on Indian steel in January 2022 as we believed the earnings cycle was inflection-down while market was too optimistic on a China stimulus. We find the landscape flipped now with China policies turning supportive and the big earnings cut for Tata Steel and Hindalco behind. We believe a sequential improvement in the quarterly EBITDA trend for Tata Steel and Hindalco in 2023 will help drive stock performance, it said.

Jefferies has upgraded Tata Steel and Hindalco from 'hold' to 'buy' and has retained 'hold' on Coal India.

At 10:07am, Tata Steel was quoting at Rs 116.45, up Rs 3.80, or 3.37 percent on BS. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 117 and an intraday low of Rs 113.75. Hindalco Industries was quoting at Rs 482.05, up Rs 8.80, or 1.86 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 488.10 and an intraday low of Rs 475.

According to Tata Steel, the implosion activity was a ""first-of-its-kind"" of engineering activity, as it was carried out in an operating steel plant, involving mega structures, ""tallest in India"".

The company said it today dismantled a ""concrete chimney of 110-meter height (Battery#6 Chimney), along with a 48-meter-tall coal tower"".

The implosions were carried out with the help of the contract partner, Edifice Engineering India, and supported by Jet Demolition South Africa, it added.

Earlier, on September 4, the implosion of ""model repair shop of 12-meter height"" at the Jameshpur facility was executed, followed by the implosion of an ""obsolete 110-metre-tall chimney (Battery #5 Chimney)"" at the coke plant on November 27.

The controlled implosion of the 110-metre-tall chimneys was executed using a mechanical hinge, enabling the structure to fall in one direction with zero degrees of deviation, the release said.

""Water curtains"" were used to control dust and ""trenches with berms"" were deployed to absorb vibration, it added, further noting that the use of ""steel wires mesh"" prevented the debris from getting scattered.

The government has selected a total of 67 entries with an investment potential of Rs 42,500 crore under the production linked incentive (PLI) scheme for specialty steel.

The proposed investments are expected to generate 70,000 job opportunities and add 26 million tonnes of speciality steel capacity in the country.

A total of 79 applications were received from 35 small and large steel-making companies with investment commitments totalling Rs 46,000 crore to add downstream capacity of 28 million tonnes (MT) by 2030, the steel ministry said in a statement.

After several extensions, the final window for participation in the PLI scheme closed on September 15, 2022.

''Sixty-seven applications from 30 companies have been selected. This will attract committed investment of Rs 42,500 crore with a downstream capacity addition of 26 MT and employment generation potential of 70,000,'' the ministry said.

Applicants include all major steel players like Tata Steel, JSW Steel, JSPL, AMNS India and SAIL, a senior steel ministry official had earlier told PTI.

The Union Cabinet in July last year approved a Rs 6,322-crore PLI scheme to boost the production of speciality steel in India.

Some of the categories of specialty steel included in the scheme are coated/plated steel products, high strength/wear-resistant steel, specialty rails, alloy steel products, and steel wires, and electrical steel.",217,0.9871552189191183

Vedanta is said to be looking for a buyer for its lossmaking steel business for a valuation of as much as Rs 12,000 crore, according to a report.

Deleveraging the balance sheet of Electrosteel Steel, which it acquired about four years ago, has been cited as one of the key reasons for the sale. One other reason could be its focus on the new semiconductor venture.

Volatility in the commodity sector could arguably be another reason for the potential sale. Significant losses for Vedanta’s steel business could have nudged Vedanta to sell the unit, which needs to expand to become competitive.

However, the Vedanta Group said exiting the steel business is “not a topic for us”, the Press Trust of India reported on November 15, citing CEO Sunil Duggal. The only priority is to raise production capacity to 3 million tonnes, according to the report.

Electrosteel Steel, now known as ESL Steel, was incorporated as a public limited company in 2006. Anil Agarwal-promoted Vedanta took control of the bankrupt company in June 2018 for a consideration of Rs 5,230 crore, with lenders forfeiting more than 55 percent of the outstanding debt.

ESL’s total secured outstanding debt was Rs 12,376.61 crore as of March 31, 2017, according to its annual report.

When Vedanta acquired ESL, it had a manufacturing capacity of 1.5 million tonnes. The proximity of its plant in Jharkhand to one of Vedanta’s iron ore mines made it a “good match” for vertically integrating the asset.

In 2019, Vedanta said it plans to scale up its steel manufacturing capacity to 3 million tonnes by the end of FY23 and 10 million tonnes five years after that. With 12 million tonnes per annum of iron ore, an ingredient in making steel, the focus has been on value-added products for margin expansion.

Vedanta has invested $348 million in growth capital expenditure.

Financials

ESL contributed 6.6 percent of Vedanta’s net debt and accounted for 1.5 percent of its cash and cash equivalents at the end of September, according to a company presentation.

ESL made losses in three of the past five financial years, reporting a profit on FY19 and FY21.

The company’s cashflows peaked at Rs 356.9 crore in FY19 and have receded since then.

The global economic slowdown, the Russia-Ukraine war, demand-supply forces and government spending and policies were cited as some of the reasons behind the hit on the company’s performance.

Peer group comparison

ESL’s earnings per tonne are relatively lower due to its smaller capacity and different product portfolio. The company’s product profile is secondary long products, unlike peers Tata Steel and JSW Steel. Its product range includes pig iron, billets, TMT bars, wire rods, and ductile iron pipes.

Potential Sale Comes Right After…

The report on the planned sale of ESL came right after Vedanta terminated Moody’s Investors Service for giving an unfavourable rating for London-based parent company Vedanta Resources’ unsecured bond.

In its October 31 report, Moody’s pointed out the possibility of the parent company squeezing the finances of operating companies Vedanta and Hindustan Zinc to pay for its borrowings since the holding company does not have operations of its own and relies on dividend income from subsidiaries to service debt.

The possible reasons for the potential sale of ESL include:

Vedanta’s debt

Vedanta’s net debt has been rising, especially since FY18. While the company managed to reduce its debt in FY22, it has picked up pace in the first half of FY23.



Selling ESL may be a viable decision given the small contribution of the steel business to Vedanta’s overall financials and significant capax needed to further expand and become competitive.

Change in capital allocation?

Another reason for the sale of ESL could be a change in Vedanta’s capital allocation strategy. The focus appears to be shifting towards the semiconductor business, which is perceived as a sunrise sector in India and has government support, unlike the steel sector, where scale is critical.

ESL’s current steel capacity is smaller than that of its counterparts. Tata Steel, Steel Authority of India, and JSW Steel all have capacities exceeding 20 million tonnes a year, while ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel and Jindal Steel and Power have huge capex plans in the pipeline.

ESL’s plan to reach 10 million tonnes per annum would require substantial investment, which may not be as lucrative at the moment compared to the situation one year ago, said Jayanta Roy, senior vice president at ICRA.

The Vedanta Group said in September it plans to invest $20 billion (Rs 1.54 lakh crore) to build a chip and display facility in Gujarat.

According to reports, the Gujarat government will provide a 75 percent subsidy for the first 200 acres of land required for a fabrication project. A 50 percent subsidy will be available for additional land required for the fabrication project or upstream/downstream activity, or other projects approved under the India Semiconductor Mission.

Commodity cycle volatility:

The softness in the commodity cycle may have promoted Vedanta to exit the lossmaking steel business. Worries about global demand, especially after the Ukraine-Russia war, have disrupted the commodity cycle, and the steel sector is no exception to that.

Shares of JSW Steel and Jindal Steel and Power are about 10 percent short of their 52-week highs.

“Indian steel spreads are around the last seven-year average and with global demand likely to be weak, it’s unlikely they will bounce back materially. In Q2, most companies reported abysmal margins but this is more of a normalisation and not the start of any strong rally as the peaks of May 2021 will take a few years to be revisited,” Rakesh Arora, cofounder of GoIndia Stocks, said in a written response to Moneycontrol’s queries.

The weak commodity cycle may have nudged Vedanta to consider the sale of ESL to have a disciplined capital expenditure plan and lower debt so as to provide more muscle to aid the finances of parent company Vedanta Resources in the form of dividends, which can only be generated via free cashflows.",1003,-0.35004586898363554

Bulls kept the market charged up last week, despite some volatility because of global factors, and pushed Nifty50 firm up above the psychological 18,000 mark with support at 17,900. After recent policy meetings, volatility too cooled down considerably to below 16 levels, giving more headroom to bulls.

The 50-share NSE benchmark gained nearly 2 percent during the week ended November 4 to settle at 18,117 on Friday with all sectors participating in the rally.

The Nifty50 traded firmly above all important exponential moving averages, and maintained higher high higher lows for the third straight week.

If the upbeat momentum sustaining, this week, though a truncated one because of Gurunanak Jayanti on November 8, may see the index may marching towards its last week's high of 18,178, followed by 18,350 (the high of 2022). If the index manages to sustain these levels then a record high of 18,604 can't be ruled out, with strong support at 18,000-17,900 levels, experts said.

""The market posted a weekly close above 18,100 last Friday. This is a clear indication of how strong our markets have been of late. Undoubtedly, the bulls continue with their hegemony in the domestic markets and are eying record highs now,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

If there is no aberration globally, the Nifty is good to go towards 18,250 – 18,350 first and then a march towards previous high of 18,600 looks very much on cards in the ongoing calendar year, he feels.

As far as supports are concerned, 18,000 followed by 17,900 should be treated as sacrosanct zone and any intra-week decline would provide opportunities to create fresh longs.

Sameet advised traders to continue with an optimistic approach and now. ""With other sectors chipping in, we expect a good broad-based buying in the forthcoming week.""

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the November 4 closing prices:

Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

Dalmia Bharat: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,742 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,575 | Target: Rs 2,000 | Return: 15 percent

Dalmia Bharat has corrected from a high of Rs 2,548 touched in September 2021. The stock recently found support around the Rs 1,212 levels in June 2022. This is close to the previous intermediate highs, indicating the change of polarity principle is at work. The stock has subsequently bounced back and made higher bottoms in the last few months.

This week, the stock broke out of a trading range on the back of huge volumes, which is encouraging. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI (relative strength index) too have bounced back and are in rising mode now.

With the intermediate technical setup too looking positive, we believe the stock has the potential to move higher in the coming weeks. We recommend buying the stock between Rs 1,720-1,760 levels, with a stop-loss at 1,575 and target at Rs 2,000.

Inox Leisure: Buy | LTP: Rs 527 | Stop-Loss: Rs 507 | Target: Rs 560 | Return: 6 percent

After correcting from a high of Rs 619 in August 2022, Inox Leisure found support around Rs 475 levels in September 2022. These are strong supports as they are just above the 50-week SMA (simple moving average).

Last week, the stock broke out of a narrow trading range on the back of above average volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50 days SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.

With the intermediate setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 523-529 levels, with a stop-loss of Rs 507 and target of Rs 560.

Muthoot Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,076 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,036 | Target: Rs 1,140 | Return: 6 percent

Muthoot Finance has bounced back from a low of Rs 950 touched in September 2022 where it made a double bottom. The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. Last week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50 days SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and have given positive divergence signals.

With the intermediate setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 1,074-1,078 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,036 and target at Rs 1,140.

Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

Ambuja Cements: Buy | LTP: Rs 559 | Stop-Loss: Rs 524 | Target: Rs 664 | Return: 19 percent

The stock is in the strong up trend, as it bounced after forming multiple bottoms between its 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci Retracement levels of prior up-move (Rs 392-586), which was placed at Rs 489 and Rs 466, respectively.

The stock has potential to move towards its 100 percent Fibonacci Extension level of prior up-move. Its daily RSI gave buy signal after consolidating above its neutral line-50.

In case of any decline, the stock will find support at around its upward sloping 20-day EMA (exponential moving average). Since October 17, the stock remained above that exponential moving average and advanced gradually.

Siemens: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,973 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,760 | Target: Rs 3,320 | Return: 12 percent

On November 4, the stock breached its prior daily falling trend and rose to one-month high. Since October 19, the stock is positively poised above its key moving averages and moved higher thereafter.

We believe undergoing positive momentum will continue and the stock will explore uncharted territory. On the higher side, the stock may face hurdle around its life-time-high of Rs 3,139 before an exponential rise.

However, a stable move above that high level will accelerate undergoing positive momentum. This could lead the stock towards its prior high connecting rising trendline.

On the lower side, the stock will find support at around its intermediate upward sloping trendline.

Bajaj Finserv: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,801 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,724 | Target: Rs 1,932 | Return: 7 percent

After a higher level of reversal, the stock oscillated around its 50-day EMA and witnessed a range breakout subsequently. In the past, the stock respected that exponential moving average and continued its prevailing trend.

As per the current set-up, history may repeat itself, which could take the stock towards its life-time-high of Rs 1,932. Substantial rise in volume and increase in future open interest signals that major market participants are in favour of the bulls.

Its daily RSI is positively poised after a trendline breakout. In case of any decline, as per the change in polarity principle, the stock will find support around its upper band of the range.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

UPL: Buy | LTP: Rs 739 | Stop-Loss: Rs 710 | Target: Rs 790 | Return: 7 percent

The stock is forming a symmetrical triangle on the weekly and daily charts. It is a difficult task for the trader to predict which side of the stock will break the trading range.

However, during the formation process, we can define specific resistance and support areas for stocks based on the boundaries of the formation. Based on it, we are expecting the stock to move towards Rs 770-790 levels in the near term.

It is a buy at current levels and on further dips with a final stop-loss at Rs 710.

Bharat Dynamics: Buy | LTP: Rs 980 | Stop-Loss: Rs 950 | Target: Rs 1,080 | Return: 10 percent

The stock is trading above the resistance of the ascending triangle, which is positive for the stock to maintain momentum. Also, it formed a Doji on Friday despite the markets being strong. These types of structures act as a continuum formation.

Above Rs 990 level, we are expecting the stock to move toward Rs 1,050-1,080 level in the near term. Buy at current levels and place stop-loss at Rs 950.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Sun TV Network: Buy | LTP: Rs 553 | Stop-Loss: Rs 536 | Target: Rs 585 | Return: 6 percent

The stock has recently formed a ‘Higher Top Higher Bottom’ structure and has given a breakout from its resistance on the weekly charts. The price upmove has been supported by good volumes while the RSI oscillator is hinting at a positive momentum.

Traders can buy the stock around current market price of Rs 553 for potential short term target around Rs 585. The stop-loss on short positions should be placed below Rs 536.

Tata Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 105 | Stop-Loss: Rs 100 | Target: Rs 114 | Return: 9 percent

The metal stocks were buzzing last week as we witnessed buying interest in some of the counters with good volumes. This stock has seen a breakout from a consolidation phase and has given a breakout from a falling trendline resistance.

The volumes have increased along with the upmove in prices which is a positive sign. The price volumes breakout hints at probability of an uptrend and hence, we advise traders to look for buying opportunities in the stock.

Traders can buy the stock around current market price of Rs 105 for potential short term target around Rs 114. The stop-loss on positions should be placed below Rs 100.

The company had planned Rs 12,000 crore of capex for the year, of which about Rs 8,500 crore was for India and the balance for Europe.

""We have spent a little less of the 50 per cent (of the planned capex) till now,"" Narendran told PTI in reply to a question related to capital expenditure plan for FY23.

For September quarter, Tata Steel reported 90 per cent drop in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,297 crore as against Rs 12,547.70 crore in the year-ago period.

In India, Tata Steel acquired Odisha-based steel maker Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL) for Rs 12,000 crore in a bidding process in July.

In the UK, the company is seeking 1.5 billion pounds from the UK government to execute its decarbonisation plans. Tata Steel owns the UK's largest steelworks at Port Talbot in South Wales and employs around 8,000 people across all its operations in the country.

Narendran has also said Tata Steel's future course of action with respect to its UK business will be based on the British government's response to the company's proposal seeking financial support to sustain the business.

To a query on the consolidation process at Tata Steel, the CEO said it will continue.

In September, the board of Tata Steel approved the amalgamation of its seven subsidiaries — Tata Steel Long Products, Tata Metaliks, The Tinplate Company of India, TRF Limited, Indian Steel & Wire Products, Tata Steel Mining and S&T Mining — into itself.

Standalone results were below estimates; while the Europe business was weak QoQ, but it was on expected lines. TATA’s standalone revenue at INR322b was 1% lower YoY, but was up 1% QoQ, and in line with our estimate of INR 317b. Standalone EBITDA stood at INR48b, down 64% YoY and 49% QoQ. A sharp ASP decline of INR14,660/y QoQ led to INR 14,445/t correction in EBITDA/t. EBITDA was 11% lower than our estimate. EBITDA/t came at INR 10,177/t, down 67% YoY and 59% QoQ, and ~INR 1300/t below our estimates. Adjusted PAT stood at INR27b, down 70% YoY and 57% QoQ, owing to lower EBITDA. Adjusted PAT was 7% lower than our estimate.

2022-11-01 14:48:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/current-affairs-trends/jj-irani-the-tata-group-faithful-who-led-the-march-of-indian-steel-9425551.html,"File image of Jamshed J Irani (Photo Source: Tata Steel)

Jamshed J Irani, who passed away in his retirement home in Jamshedpur at the age of 86, was the perfect company man who came back from a stint in Britain to join Tata Steel (then Tata Iron and Steel Company) in 1968. He stayed on for the next 33 years, steering the company through tumultuous times both within and without.

When he took over as managing director of the flagship of the Tata Group in 1992, it was the battleground of a fierce struggle for control between Ratan Tata, named Group Chairman the previous year by JRD Tata, and the feisty Russi Mody, who had been the all-powerful czar used to running the company like his personal fief.

Mody saw Irani as a rival to the throne and a man whose loyalties lay with Tata. The Tata Steel of the day was a vast, lumbering giant whose return on capital was abysmal but whose clout in the Tata group was such that Mody, who had been running it for the previous 20 years, believed he was the leading contender to replace the aging JRD when he hung up his big boots.

Irani, initially a minor player in this boardroom battle, emerged from the shadows to first steer clear of Mody’s pervasive influence and then lead the company up the more difficult path to financial redemption.

More than a match

It wasn’t easy. Forced out after losing the power struggle to Ratan Tata, Mody kept his acolyte Aditya Kashyap, along with other trusted lieutenants, in the company’s hierarchy to keep the struggle simmering.

Irani, a PhD in metallurgy and a former JN Tata scholar, may have given the impression he wasn’t up to the cut and thrust of corporate politics. But as it turned out he was more than a match even for the wily Mody.

It helped that he had the backing of the young Ratan Tata keen to wrest back control over the group’s key firms. In April 1992, the Tata Sons board passed a resolution requiring all those who had turned 75 to retire as company chairmen. With that one move, Tata eliminated the challenge of heavyweights like Darbari Seth, Nani Palkhivala and, of course, Russi Mody.

Transforming Tata Steel

But if Tata’s job was done, Irani’s was just beginning. The reforms of 1991 had forced Indian companies to face fresh competition even as they geared up for newer market openings. Tata Steel was then a grossly overstaffed, highly bureaucratic company where decision-making was slow and technology outdated. It was also one of the most high-cost producers of steel in the world and its productivity levels were a tenth of what they were at the best companies abroad.

Under Irani, it underwent a transformation as he cut the bloated workforce, modernised processes, flattened structures by cutting middle management and moved up the value chain in terms of products. Over the next decade Tata Steel reduced costs and also improved quality to global standards. In all of this, Irani took a personal initiative to address small groups of workers to convince them about the virtues of the separation scheme the company had initiated.

By the time his term came to a close in 2001, Tata Steel had shed nearly half the number of employees it had in 1991. The losses of 1992 had been forgotten and the company was now throwing up enough cash to embolden Ratan Tata just six years later to make an audacious multi-billion dollar bid for Corus.

Technologist by training, temperament

Irani is widely acknowledged as the turnaround artist who pulled back one of India’s most pedigreed companies from the brink of disaster.

By training and temperament, he was a technologist. Not surprisingly among the many accolades he bagged were the “Platinum Medal” given in 1988 by the Indian Institute of Metals, and the “Twelfth Willy Korf Steel Vision Award” from World Steel Dynamics and American Metal Market.

Today, India is ranked the world's second-largest producer of crude steel and a major player in the global sweepstakes. The foundations of this achievement were laid by JJ Irani through the 1990s.",695,-0.13618928619793483

Tata Steel will remain in focus today after the company on October 31 reported an 87 percent on-year decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,514 crore for the September quarter. Tata Steel's profit declined 80 percent sequentially.

Consolidated revenue remained flat with a marginal decline of 1 percent year-on-year to Rs 59,878 crore. It was down 6 percent on-quarter.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after the September quarter earnings:

CLSA

We have downgraded the stock to 'sell' and cut the target price to Rs 90 from Rs 110 per share.

The Q2 was below estimates as a weak India offset strong Europe. CLSA expects the Indian margin to improve but see meaningful downside to European profitability and also see downside risks to Indian steel prices as they are at 12-16 percent premiums to import parity.

The broking house cut the FY23-25 EBITDA estimate by 18-25 percent on lower profitability (largely in Europe), reported CNBC-TV18

Motilal Oswal

The stock is currently trading at 4.8x FY23 EV/EBITDA and 1x P/B. We believe the stock is fully valued given the current steel prices outlook globally.

Jamshed J Irani, known as the steel man of India, died in Jamshedpur late Monday night, Tata Steel said. He was 85.

Irani was associated with Tata Steel for over four decades. He retired from the board of Tata Steel in June 2011, leaving behind a legacy of 43 years, which won him and the Company international acclaim in various fields.

Born on June 2, 1936 in Nagpur to Jiji Irani and Khorshed Irani, Dr Irani completed his BSc from Science College, Nagpur in 1956 and MSc in Geology from the Nagpur University in 1958.

He then went to the University of Sheffield in UK as a J N Tata scholar, where he secured a Masters in Metallurgy in 1960, and a PhD in Metallurgy in 1963.

He started his professional career with the British Iron and Steel Research Association in Sheffield in 1963, but always yearned to contribute to the Nation's progress. He returned to India to join The Tata Iron and Steel Company (now Tata Steel), as it was then known, in 1968, and joined the firm as Assistant to the Director in-charge of Research and Development.

He went on to become General Superintendent in 1978, General Manager in 1979, and President of Tata Steel in 1985. He became Joint Managing Director of Tata Steel in 1988, and Managing Director in 1992 before retiring in 2001.

He joined the Board of Tata Steel in 1981 and was also a Non-Executive Director from 2001 for a decade. Besides Tata Steel and Tata Sons, Dr Irani also served as a Director of several Tata Group companies, including Tata Motors and Tata Teleservices.

Tata steel may not be able to live up to its target of “a billion-dollar debt reduction a year” for financial year 2023 as it factors in the market volatility, movements in cash flow, and working capital abilities. More so, as it takes on board acquisition of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL) and cash flows on account of dividend pay-out. Earlier, the steel maker was aiming for growth without comprising on its deleveraging target. But now, there seems to be a slight shift in the stance keeping in mind the current market scenario.

Having said that, the company doesn’t intend to change its policy/ strategy around debt, just as yet, and would want to recalibrate on these numbers by the next quarter of the ongoing financial year, i.e. Q3 FY23.

Tata Steel Ltd on October 31 reported an 87 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in consolidated profit after tax (PAT) at Rs 1,514 crore for the September quarter. Sequentially, the profit declined 80 percent. In a post earnings press call, the management of the company said that it remains certain that it won’t be able to reduce the quantum of debt by a billion dollars and end the ongoing financial year exactly at the similar levels as the previous one. The company’s gross debt stood at Rs 75,561 crore for financial year ended March 31, 2022.

Tata Steel reported nearly 6 percent sequential rise in its gross debt levels for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 at Rs 87,516 crore compared to Rs 82,597 crore reported for the June quarter of the similar financial year.

“Deleveraging is no longer the most important thing for Tata Steel. It will happen as natural course as soon as we (Tata Steel) start generating free cash flows in excess of what we require,” said the company’s ED & CFO, Koushik Chatterjee, in a teleconference held for media after the company reported its Q2 numbers. “But we will be doing initiatives to see how we can work our way back to the levels seen at the start of the financial year.”

Tata Steel’s investor presentation suggests that “bunching up of large cash pay-outs of Rs 19,000 crore for Q2 on account of NINL acquisition, and FY22 dividend pay-out mainly led to rise of debt by September 30, 2022.

Replying to the query on debt asked by Moneycontrol, Tata Steel’s Managing Director (MD) TV Narendran, said, “The numbers are significantly higher in this quarter on account of dividend of Rs 6,290 crore, capex of nearly Rs 3,200 crore and acquisition cost of more than Rs 10,000 crore. Some working capital release should take place once high-cost inventory flows through the system.”

No brighter future for Europe in the offing?

Narendran doesn’t expect a better second half of the financial year for the European division. He expects margin compression even as the company continues to renegotiate the contract.

It also continues to engage in a dialogue with the new government in the UK as it seeks a relief package for the transition to green steel. The amount has not yet been disclosed by the management.

Tata Steel owns the UK's largest steelworks at Port Talbot in South Wales and employs around 8,000 people across all its operations in the country. The company is seeking 1.5 billion pounds from the UK government to execute its decarbonisation plans.

On a conference call, Narendran said, ""Obviously plans are being made in case we don't get the support that we seek form the (UK) government, but it's too early to talk about (it), but again a lot of conversations are going on internally to how we plan for all situations."" He made the remarks in reply to a question on the company's plan in case the UK government does not accept the Tata Steel's proposal.

Tata Steel is seeking support from the UK government in two forms. In policy terms by encouraging the transition to green steel and ensuring a cost competitive landscape, and partnership in financing of the project given the size of investment and the financially constrained position of the UK business.

When asked if a decision to engage with a buyer will be taken after the response of the government, Narendran replied in affirmative.

""Absolutely, whatever we do we will decide based on the response of the UK government,"" he said.

Tata Steel on October 25 announced the signing of a pact with automobile major Ford for the supply of ""Zeremis"", or zero-emission green steel, to the company.

As per the memorandum of understanding (MoU), the supply to Ford would be initiated after Tata Steel's plant in the Netherlands' IJmuiden ""switches to green hydrogen-based steelmaking"".

The agreement makes Ford the ""first customer"" committed to offtake the green steel that Tata Steel plans to produce via the hydrogen route, which is more sustainable and cleaner than the current steel-making method, the company said in a release to the media.

Green hydrogen refers to the hydrogen generated from electrolysis of water, with the entire process run on renewable energy.

In the industry, colour is assigned based on the source of electricity that is used to generate the hydrogen molecule. Brown hydrogen is for coal, grey for natural gas and blue if it is produced from natural gas. ​

Ford has set a target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035. The procurement of more environmentally-friendly produced steel is considered an essential to achieve the goal.

“Our customers, like us, want to take care of our planet, and we are taking the necessary steps on this journey, providing the vehicles they need to make a positive contribution against climate change, produced in a more sustainable way,” said Sue Slaughter, Ford purchasing director-supply chain and sustainability.

Improvements within the company's supply chain are key and with the use of carbon-neutral steel, Ford will take a major step towards lowering the CO2 footprint of its vehicles, Slaughter added.

Apart from securing the supply of Zeremis green steel, Ford is also considering other Tata Steel offerings, including the recently launched Zeremis Carbon Lite steel, which comes with an ""allocated carbon footprint reduction of up to 100 percent"", the release said.

""By aligning our sustainability ambitions with customers like Ford, we can create an early market for green steel, speed up the transition and meet the expectations of society at large,"" Hans van den Berg, chairman of the board of management of Tata Steel Nederland BV said.",360,0.9817931652069092

The restructuring exercise, under which strategic businesses will be merged with Tata Steel, has not just been delayed but has now been delivered in a different shape, size, and form from the earlier envisaged strategy.

The company cited “significant changes in the underlying business conditions” as the reason for the withdrawal of the earlier scheme of amalgamation.

The change in strategy prompts many questions about details of the earlier scheme, the timelines for completion of the current scheme, change of product mix, and the financial benefits of this exercise.

Moneycontrol explains them in detail:

Was the restructuring move long overdue?

In November 2020, a scheme was envisaged for the merger of Tata Metaliks with Tata Steel Long Products to enhance vertical integration in the long product segment.

Tata Steel Long Products is a manufacturer of high alloy steel primarily for the auto sector and wire rope industry. Tata Metaliks is a producer of pig iron and ductile iron pipes.

The planned amalgamation had implications from rating companies including ICRA, which placed Tata Metaliks under rating watch with developing implications until completion of the merger.

Now, Tata Steel Long Products and Tata Metaliks – two of the seven subsidiaries – are amalgamating with Tata Steel.

Tata Steel Long Product’s board withdrew the earlier scheme of amalgamation on September 22, citing significant changes in the underlying business conditions of both companies resulting in dilution of the inherent benefits that were initially envisaged.

Clarity on timelines, approvals

Tata Steel hasn’t provided a timeline for the completion of the merger, which will need approvals from a range of regulators and statutory bodies including the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the National Stock Exchange of India and the BSE, and governmental/quasi-judicial authorities.

Is this Tata Steel’s first attempt at consolidation?

This isn’t the first time that Tata Steel has tried to simplify its group holding structure. Since 2019, Tata Steel has reduced 116 associated entities – 72 subsidiaries have ceased to exist, 20 associates and joint ventures have been eliminated, and 24 companies are under liquidation, it said on September 23.

Motilal Oswal expects the exercise to continue but said a big reduction in the number of entities may take place only after the sale or closure of its international subsidiaries, including Tata Steel Europe, Tata Steel Thailand, and NatSteel.

How does the product portfolio change?

Tata Steel is predominantly in flat products and while the addition of long products will dilute the mix, it will still be in favour of flats.

According to Jayanta Roy, senior VP and group head of ICRA, “Tata Steel’s long product portfolio, which continues to remain at 18 percent of overall India operations’ product mix after inclusion of longs and excluding NINL (Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd.), would scale up to 22 percent. But the same would be diluted to 17 percent after the completion of Kalinganagar phase 2 expansion, which is expected to take place by FY24.”

Tata Steel is expanding the capacity of its Kalinganagar plant to 8 million tonnes per annum at a cost of Rs 23,500 crore.

This is expected to result in optimisation of product offerings since there could be sharper management oversight on the expansion plan/integration of NINL, the steel mill in Odisha that Tata Steel Long Products acquired from the government earlier in 2022.

How will the merger help the financials?

The amalgamation is expected to lead to some cost savings and synergy benefits. The management expects savings of Rs 700-800 crore on a net present value (NPV) basis due to the non-payment of additional royalty on iron ore supplies to these subsidiaries after the merger. The savings on additional royalty will depend on iron ore prices in Jharkhand and Odisha, where these mines operate.

As per Tata Steel’s press release, there will also be some tax-saving benefits since Tata could use the unabsorbed business loss/depreciation of these subsidiaries.

Will the recently acquired NINL become part of the amalgamated entity?

The Tata Group acquired NINL, which has a capacity of 1.1 million tonnes, for about Rs 12, 100 crore earlier this year.

NINL will continue to operate as an independent company, in keeping with the terms and conditions set by the government, which sold its stake in the company.

The big consolidation drive by Tata Steel isn’t expected to have any material impact on the financials of the company over the long term, according to most brokerages. However, these brokerages have refrained from putting any target price or adopting a change of rating stance in the absence of clarity in terms of financial benefits from synergies, and the timelines involved.

On September 23, the company announced that it would be amalgamating seven subsidiaries with itself and that their resources would be pooled to unlock shareholder value. However, it noted, this would require several approvals, including from stock exchanges and the NCLT, among others.

ALSO READ: Tata Steel Amalgamation – positive for group structure, neutral for value creation

The following are key takeaways from brokerages:

JP Morgan

Maintains an overweight rating with a target price of Rs 140 per share. The foreign brokerage sees a very marginal impact from the consolidation drive on the financials of the company. According to the brokerage, markets and investors anyway look at the earnings and balance sheet on a consolidated basis and all the subsidiaries are part of the consolidated accounts.

The brokerage has listed Tata Steel Longs as the key subsidiary for the benefits of the proposed merger, given its acquisition of NINL. According to the brokerage, the proposed merger is incrementally positive as it should allow for a faster rollout of expansion capex. JP Morgan sees the company’s price-to-book value at around 2009/2014/2020 lows, even as its underlying balance sheet is the strongest it has been in 10+ years.

Motilal Oswal

The brokerage has maintained a neutral rating with a target price of Rs 106. Motilal Oswal, too, doesn’t expect any incremental profits to accrue to the group and expects no incremental profits other than elimination of regulatory costs such as iron ore royalty.

The brokerage has noted that the company will also save on other regulatory costs, such as audits and filings/compliance under various Acts, which are not only costly but also time consuming, especially in cases where the size of operations does not justify the regulatory costs.

It expects further consolidation on the books. Motilal Oswal said it expected simplification of the group structure to continue, but that a big reduction in the number of subsidiaries would only occur after the sale/closure of its international subsidiaries, including TSE, TSTH, and NatSteel, if at all. The brokerage has not changed its earnings estimates at present, as it awaits clarity on synergies and timelines for the merger. In terms of P/B, the stock is trading at 1.1 times/1 time its FY23E/FY24 estimated book value.

Edelweiss Securities

Perceiving amalgamation as a prudent step, Edelweiss Securities has maintained its hold rating on Tata Steel with an unchanged target price of Rs 198.5 per share. It sees lower royalty, iron ore costs and potential synergies as the key benefits over the medium to long term. It also believes that this amalgamation will provide a firm direction to the group’s plan of enhancing its long portfolio. However, Edelweiss Securities expects the benefits of incremental EBITDA from the subsidiaries to be offset by the dilution in the shareholding.

Tata Steel Ltd, the country’s biggest steel producer, has announced the merger of seven of its subsidiaries with itself, excluding Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL), which it recently acquired.

The merger is a big positive for streamlining the overall group structure, enabling efficient utilisation of facilities and optimisation of procurement and working capital management, analysts said. However, they do not see any value addition or value creation for the time being due to the merger.

Tata Steel: Implication of amalgamation for shareholders

Possible Synergies

Post the merger, Tata Steel management expects a saving of around Rs 700–800 crore on a net present value (NPV) basis on royalty payments it currently has to make for iron ore supplies to these subsidiaries. However, these savings are dependent on the prices of iron ore in Odisha and Jharkhand where the mines are located.

According to a report from the research firm Motilal Oswal, “Tata is currently paying an additional royalty of 22.5 percent of IBM (Indian Bureau of Mines) prices for the quantum of iron ore supplied to Tata Steel Long Products (TSLP) and Tata Steel Mining Ltd (TSML)”. This is over and above the normal royalty paid to National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET) and District Mineral Foundation (DMF) already paid for the iron ore dispatched from its mines. This normal royalty works out to 19.8 percent.

The group will also save on other regulatory costs like audits, filings/compliances under various Acts which are not only costly but also time-consuming, especially in cases where the size of operations does not justify the regulatory costs, said the Motilal Oswal report.

Merger of entities with Tata Steel will simplify management, help focus on business: CFO Koushik Chatterjee

Value Neutral

Analysts say the amalgamation may not add/create much value in terms of profitability except for the savings on royalty and regulatory costs. “We believe the merger is broadly value-neutral at the proposed swap ratios,” said a report from BOB Capital Markets. “While it will result in 2.2 percent dilution of Tata Steel’s shares, this would largely be offset by a lower share of the minority interest in earnings and modest cost savings of Rs 700 crore pre-tax mainly on account of additional royalty that is currently payable by Tata Steel on the sale of captive iron ore.”

Valuations

Post the announcement of the merger, the brokerages are not yet making any revisions to their estimates. They would like to wait for the completion of the merger and see how the synergies play out.

“We note that Tata Steel has been trying to merge TSLP and TTML, among other companies, for a while but had been unable to consummate the same and hence, we will wait for further clarity on the completion of these mergers,” said the Motilal Oswal report. The brokerage would also like to understand the timeline for the merger as the company has just made the announcement in this regard and would also seek greater clarity on the actual (and not NPV) synergy benefits that will accrue to the merged entity to evaluate the quantum of EPS accretion from this merger.

Jefferies, a global research firm, has a ‘hold’ rating on Tata Steel and has raised its target price from Rs 87 per share to Rs 95 per share on the back of lower price-to-book (PB) valuations and a better outlook on cash flows.

Motilal Oswal has a ‘neutral’ on the stock with a target price of Rs 106 per share as it estimates the stock trading at 4.3x EV/EBITDA for FY23 and 4.6x for FY24. In terms of price to book value (P/BV), it pegs the stock trading at 1.1x BV for FY23 and 1x for FY24. It expects Tata Steel to generate a return on equity (RoE) of 18.5 percent for FY23 and 14.4 percent in FY24 as compared to an RoE of 44.4 percent in FY22.

On the other hand, BOB Capital Markets has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 140 a share on one-year forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 5.5x. “We continue to prefer defensive play in Tata Steel for its ability to generate sector-leading margins via better integration all the way to iron ore and for its focus on downstream and retail businesses to capture value-add,” it said in its report.

Tata Steel was trading at Rs 99.75, down 4.36 percent on the NSE at 13.48 pm on September 26.

''We have been driving simplification across Tata Steel for some time. The objective is to consolidate the subsidiary businesses within Tata Steel to drive simplification of management and also have a sharper focus on the business,'' Chatterjee told PTI.

After successfully integrating Bhushan Steel, which was much larger and more complex, this was the next natural step, the official who is also an executive director of Tata Steel, said.

In 2018, Tata Steel through its wholly-owned subsidiary Bamnipal Steel Ltd (BNPL) completed the acquisition of controlling stake of 72.65 per cent in Bhushan Steel Ltd (BSL).

Tata Steel Ltd had won the bid to acquire debt-laden Bhushan Steel in an auction under the insolvency process.

On the merger, the company official further said: ''The net present value of all synergies will be over Rs 1,000 crore, which is a material value unlocking potential. This covers benefits on cost takeouts, leveraging the synergies on procurement, commercial and financing synergies.'' All the businesses of the amalgamating companies have a good future. These businesses are part of Tata Steel's enterprise strategy and the company has much more flexibility to grow some of these businesses faster, he said.

According to Tata Steel, the merger is also part of its continuing journey to simplify the group holding structure.

Since 2019 Tata Steel has reduced 116 associated entities (72 subsidiaries have ceased to exist, 20 associates and joint ventures have been eliminated and 24 companies are currently under liquidation).",313,0.9977467656135559

Rupee may fall to 82 to a dollar this year but RBI unlikely to defend aggressively, say currency experts

The Indian rupee may slide to 82 per dollar this year on account of hawkish US Federal Reserve and global recessionary fears, according to most of the six forex market experts Moneycontrol spoke to this month. Wider trade deficits, narrowing India-US interest rate differential and the possibility of rising crude oil prices are also set to keep the rupee under pressure, they said. However, faced with dwindling forex reserves, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may not be aggressive in defending the Indian currency and allow it to catch up with other emerging market (EM) currencies that have dropped more.

Tata Steel’s board has approved the scheme of amalgamation between seven of its group companies and itself, as per the company’s exchange filing. These are Tata Steel Long Products, The Tinplate Company of India, Tata Metaliks, TRF Limited, the Indian Steel & Wire Products, Tata Steel Mining and S&T Mining Company.

The scheme of amalgamation was reviewed and recommended to the board by the committee of independent directors and the audit committee. The resources of the merged entity have been pooled to unlock the opportunity for creating shareholders’ value, said Tata Steel’s press release. The share exchange ratio has been decided individually for the seven companies, as per the filing.

The proposed amalgamation is also part of Tata Steel’s continuing journey to simplify the group holding structure. Since 2019 Tata Steel has reduced 116 associated entities (72 subsidiaries have ceased to exist, 20 Associates and JVs have been eliminated and 24 companies are currently under liquidation), said the company in its press release.

Each scheme of amalgamation will now move into a defined regulatory approval process, which includes approval by stock exchanges and the NCLT.

Rationale Behind The Merger

The amalgamation is expected to result in focused growth, and operational efficiencies, and create synergies amongst the business. In line with group level 5S strategy – simplification, synergy, scale, sustainability, and speed – proposed amalgamation will simplify group holding structure by eliminating multiple companies within the group. It is expected to lead to better utilization of common facilities, sharing of best practices, elimination of duplication and multiplicity of compliance requirement and rationalization of administrative expenses among other things.

The resulting corporate holding structure is expected to bring enhanced agility to business ecosystem of the merged entity.

Shares of Tata group firm TRF Ltd surged over 100 percent in the last six consecutive sessions amid higher volumes with the stock hitting over six-year highs.

The stock scaled Rs 340.55 a share - a level last seen on July 12, 2016 - and hit the upper circuit for the sixth straight session and advanced 102 percent in this period. Since the start of August, it climbed 172 percent.

Credit rating firm CARE Rating recently revised its outlook on the long-term rating of TRF from 'negative' to 'stable' after TRF promoter Tata Steel invested Rs 165 crore in the company for its working capital requirements in June.

Tata Steel has acquired 16.5 crore, 12.17 percent (effective yield) non-cumulative, non-convertible, non-participating, redeemable preference shares (NCRPS) of face value Rs 10 each of the company,"" thereby investing Rs 165 crore, according to a BSE notification.

""The revision in outlook is on account of reduction in outside liability through the support of funds received from the parent Tata Steel Ltd (TSL). Furthermore, the company has recorded continuous decline in cash losses over the past two years and CARE envisages that the company is likely to turn marginally cash positive in FY23, largely on the back of order-book execution for TSL"", Care rating said in its notification.

The rally, according to analysts, was fostered by sustained increase in operating profitability and improvement in the order book position both from Tata Steel and other clients.

Around 75 percent of the order book of TRF comes from Tata Steel. As on July 1, TRF has an outstanding order book of Rs 363 crore with about 25 percent of the order coming from the external parties. The total operating income of the company increased by 25 percent year-on-year to Rs 147.94 crore in FY22, driven by an increase in service income to Rs 38.86 crore to Rs 20.86 crore a year ago.

TSL also supports TRF by infusing funds in the form of inter-corporate deposits and unsecured loans in case of any liquidity mismatch.

""As on March 31, capital structure of the company remains weak owing to the negative net worth base. The company has been reporting losses for the past three which led to the deterioration of net worth,"" CARE Ratings said.

Before this investment, Tata Steel as a promoter held a 34.11 percent equity stake in TRF, and also has 25 crore non-convertible redeemable preference shares and 2.5 crore, 11.25 percent optionally convertible redeemable preference shares (OCRPS) of the company.

Through the buying of NCRPS, Tata Steel will assist its associate company TRF in meeting its additional working capital requirements, repaying the whole or a part of the existing debts, and other general corporate purposes.

Tata Steel said on August 31 that it will invest more than 65 million euros in hydrogen-based steel manufacturing in the Netherlands. Hydrogen has the potential to decarbonise steel manufacturing.

Tata Steel has inked pacts with three firms -- McDermott, Danieli, and Hatch -- for the further technical preparations for hydrogen-based steel manufacturing in the Dutch city of Ijmuiden.

All three companies have their own specific proficiency that is needed together to assist Tata Steel in hydrogen-based steel manufacturing.

""The cost for this first development step is in excess of 65 million euros and will result in an engineering package that forms the basis for a final permitting and project planning,"" the company said in a statement.

The overall project is led by the Tata Steel internal project and sustainability team, with close support from the main delivery partners.

McDermott is responsible for the construction input and support of the technical project management. Danieli will oversee the engineering design of the plant and technology that delivers the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), the first step in the iron-making process.

Hatch is the technology licensor of the electric furnaces that melt the DRI and help reduce the oxygen content further, thereby improving the final steel quality. The REF and DRI plants are closely combined to form an integrated production system.

(Representative image)

Steel is the most commonly used metal in almost everything -- from cars, aeroplanes, ships, machinery, and buildings to washing machines and household items. However, around 75 per cent of steel globally is made in coal-fired blast furnaces, which pump large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

With climate change threatening the globe, governments and industries are looking at sustainable ways of production across industries to reduce carbon emissions, and there is a major focus on the steel industry.

A week back, mining billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Vedanta partnered with IIT-Bombay to develop technology for producing green steel using hydrogen, which targets a significant reduction in carbon footprint.

Vedanta is not the only company to tread the green path, many other metal companies, both globally and locally, across sectors and geographies, have been chalking plans to decarbonise their operations.

But first, what’s green steel?

Green steel is the manufacturing of steel without the use of fossil fuels. This new phenomenon is about producing steel by using low-carbon energy sources such as hydrogen, coal gasification, or electricity instead of the traditional carbon-intensive manufacturing route of coal-fired plants.

Why is green steel the need of the hour?

Currently, the steel industry is the largest industrial sector in terms of intensive energy and resource use. It is among the three biggest emitters of carbon dioxide (CO2), and with the aggressive expansion plans across companies globally, the emissions levels are only expected to rise if the traditional methods were to continue.

According to ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India's presentation at a Steel Mint event, the iron ore and steel industry globally accounts for around 8 percent of total CO2 emissions on annual basis, whereas in India, it contributes 12 percent to the total CO2 emissions.

With such high emissions, steel producers in India and globally are facing escalating pressure from governments and investors to reduce their carbon footprint from both environmental and economic perspectives.

In view of commitments made at the Conference of the Parties (COP) climate change conference, the Indian steel industry needs to reduce its emissions substantially by 2030 and hit net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. This is where green steel comes in.

Have global companies launched green steel projects?

Several global players have taken aggressive action toward climate control by signing up for more carbon-neutral ways of producing steel. Mercedez-Benz has bought an equity stake in H2 Green Steel, while BMW has sealed a deal with H2 Green Steel on low-CO2 steel deliveries. Salzgitterag offers green flat steel in a differentiated range of dimensions and grades for automotive production.

ArcelorMittal Sestao (Spain) plans to construct green hydrogen direct reduced iron plant at Gijon as well as a new hybrid electric arc furnace. SSAB'S produces the world's first fossil-free steel in Sweden and delivers it to Volvo. It also delivers fossil-free steel to Mercedez Benz. Bluemint Steel-Thyssenkrupp Steel has launched steel with an allocated low Co2 intensity.

How are Indian steelmakers contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions?

Global steelmakers are focusing on green steel options and Indian companies are no exception. Even as their actions aren't as concrete as the global players, the intent backed by financial commitment has been made.

Jindal Steel & Power Ltd (JSPL) plans to develop its Odisha plant into the largest and greenest facility in the world. The company claims to be the first steelmaker in the world to build coal gasification to produce steel using clean coal technologies.

Tata Steel's Netherland subsidiary has launched Zeremis Carbon, a green steel solution that offers a 30 percent reduction in CO2 intensity as part of its aim to eliminate CO2 emissions by 2050. The company has committed to switching to green hydrogen-based steelmaking. It is aiming to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 30 percent by 2030 and to emit 75 percent less CO2 by around 2035, with the ultimate goal of eliminating CO2 emissions by 2050.

JSW Steel has earmarked Rs 10,000 crore to increase the use of renewable energy to replace thermal power and other green initiatives. ArcelorMittal-Nippon Steel India, a joint venture between ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel, has committed Rs 273 crore for various environmental initiatives including a zero liquid discharge system at its Hazira steel complex in Gujarat.

What are the hurdles for green steel production?

While green steel is the way forward to reduce the carbon footprint. it is certainly not an easy fix. If various reports, experts and companies are to be believed, then green steel is still decades away.

According to Aruna Sharma, former Steel Secretary, ""Green steel is far-fetched till natural gas availability and hydrogen gas become commercially viable."" She added since all the investments are just being made so least one generation will continue to manufacture steel via coking coal base, but CO2 capture and disposal of slug is going strong and will be a technique to bring down carbon emissions.

But Australia-based flat steel manufacturing Bluescope Steel suggests that ""one of the major drags on green steel developments is the global energy crisis, particularly in Europe, because green steel requires significantly more electricity than traditional steelmaking methods"".

An unstable energy market is starting to hollow out the manufacturing sector and if a crisis were not to be solved anytime soon, it would have a bearing on the green steel vision of most of the companies across the globe and India.",931,-0.6348410149415334

Welcoming the Tata group to the state, the chief minister said that this is a 'Red letter' day in the history of the state as this is the maiden investment by the global company in the state.

He expressed hope that investment by this major industrial group will further put the state on a high growth trajectory of industrial development. Mann said that the Tata Group will invest around Rs 2,600 crore in the first phase of the project which will be located at Ludhiana, adjacent to Hi-Tech Valley Industrial Park of the Punjab Government.

Bhagwant Mann said that the electric arc furnace-based plant will produce 0.75 MTPA (million tonnes per annum) finished steel adding that the raw material for the steel making process is 100 per cent scrap. Narendran said that Punjab is an ideal location for their electric arc furnace given its proximity to the market and scrap generating auto hub.

Narendran said that steel produced through the recycled route entails lower resource consumption and lower carbon emissions, which reinforces their commitment to reduce the environmental impact of our operations.",283,0.9991903901100159

Steelmakers in the country expect some relief soon as the government is likely to roll back export duty on some steel products, if not all.

Senior industry executives told Moneycontrol that the government is likely to withdraw the export duty on steel in phases. The government is believed to be considering rolling back export duty on flat products first, while the export duty on building construction steel like Rebars, wire roads, and roofing sheets would continue.

Flat steel products include the likes of the hot rolled coil (HRC), cold rolled coil and plates among other things.

In an attempt to curb spiking inflation, the government on May 22 imposed an export duty of 15 percent on select pig iron, flat-rolled products of iron or non-alloyed steel, bars and rods and various flat-rolled products of stainless steel and another 45 percent on iron ore pellet. Similarly, the export duty on iron ores and concentrates was raised to 50 percent from 30 percent.

JSW Steel’s Joint Managing Director Seshagiri Rao had told Moneycontrol that he expects the export duty to be rolled back before September end. But two other senior industry players said it could be sooner.

An email query from Moneycontrol to the Ministry of Finance remained unanswered. Media reports have been rife that the ministry is considering export duty upon the recommendation of the Steel Ministry.

Industry experts and officials have been urging the government to roll back the levy as it increases uncertainty in the export market. They maintained that the duty was a double whammy for the industry as it put the export margin under pressure at a time when the prices had started correcting, taking cues from falling international coking coal prices.

“I am very confident that government would soon roll back the measure since part of the industry’s capex has been committed towards creating capacities which could be exported and the government also stands to lose foreign exchange,” a senior executive from a steel company said on condition of anonymity.

Alok Sahay, Secretary General of Indian Steel Association, at an event last week said the imposition of export duty on steel has ended up hurting steel production by 8-10 percent and impacted the country’s foreign exchange inflows.

“The prices have now come close to the bottom level and have started causing injury to the steel industry, which is also evident from Q1 result of steel industry majors. The government has lost huge foreign exchange revenue and overall business sentiment has gone down,” Sahay said.",473,-0.3605456863130842

The company has partnered with New Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) for the proposed exercise.

The initiative focuses on comprehensive water audits involving the use and balance of the resource, quality profiling, identification of water losses and leakages, the company said in a statement.

It also said this will enable TSML to develop an integrated industrial water management strategy that optimises efficient use of water and improves productivity of the resource at its units.

TSML has also tied up with FluxGen Engineering Technologies, a Karnataka-based company working on water solutions, to install AquaGen mechanism to reduce consumption of the resource, the statement said.

AuqaGen is a SaaS (software as a service) platform that will give a secure and single-window access system to digital data of the entire water infrastructure on parameters such as water flow and bore-well water level.

Speaking on these initiatives, TSML Managing Director Pankaj Kumar Satija said, ""Water being a critical national resource, we are focusing on zero down groundwater withdrawal and a 30 per cent reduction in surface water intake by 2030.""

To begin with, TSML, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Tata Steel, is deploying AquaGen at its Sukinda chromite mine in Jajpur and ferroalloy plant at Athagarh in Cuttack district, the statement said.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel (TATA) reported a strong 1QFY23 with both India and European operations beating our and consensus estimates. European operations especially posted the highest ever EBITDA/t and for the first time in the history, since being acquired, reported EBITDA/t higher than that of the parent. TATA’s standalone revenue at INR320b was 16% higher YoY but was down 13% QoQ. The YoY growth was driven by 19% growth in blended ASP offset by 3% decline in sales volume. The sequential revenue decline was led by 22% volume decline offset by ASP growth of 10%. The revenue beat our estimates by 7% on account of 7% ASP beat. Standalone EBITDA stood at INR96b down 28% YoY and 22% QoQ. The decline in EBITDA was largely due to higher coking coal cost. EBITDA/t for the quarter stood at INR24,622, down 26% YoY and flat QoQ. EBITDA was 25% higher than our estimate driven by 7% topline beat.



Outlook

We maintain our Neutral rating with a revised SoTP-based TP of INR1,055 (up from INR975 earlier).

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Steel

TATA steel (TATA) reported strong set of Q1FY23 earnings. EBITDA remained flat QoQ at Rs149.7bn (down 7% YoY), above our/consensus estimates (CE) by 16%/20%. The beat was largely due to stronger than expected margins in Tata steel Europe (TSE). Domestic steel prices fell sharply by ~25% in last couple of months due to slump in global demand, elevated inventory and subdued recovery in Chinese demand. We see further fall in prices in wake of sharp decline in coking coal prices, destocking and weak demand. Though margins are expected to come off sharply by 35-40% QoQ in Q2FY23, still the levels are far higher than sustained low margins in down cycle. We expect that it would take couple of quarters for margins to bottom-out due to 1) weak demand in US & Europe, 2) concerns on high inflation and 3) uncertain market conditions in China. Stock has come-off sharply, because of combination of factors including export duty imposed by Govt of India.

Outlook

However, margins way above historical averages in both India and Europe, challenging macro environment and limited upside drives our negative view on stock. Maintain Reduce rating with TP of Rs975, EV/EBITDA of 5x FY24e.

Tata Steel share price is in focus, a day after the company declared its June quarter earnings.

Tata Steel Ltd on July 25 declared a consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 7,765 crore for the quarter ended June 2022. The net profit was lower by 12.8 percent, compared to Rs 8,907 crore recorded a year back. On a sequential basis, the bottomline shed 20.4 percent from Rs 9,756 crore achieved in the quarter ended March.

Consolidated revenues for the Tata Group company during the reported quarter rose 18.6 percent to Rs 63,430 crore from Rs 53,465 crore a year ago. On a sequential basis, the consolidated revenues dipped 8.5 percent from Rs 69,324 crore in the previous quarter.

The performance for the quarter was impacted by the higher pet coke prices which resulted pushed up operating costs, while the export duty imposed by the government choked the exports which had a negative impact on the volumes.

At 9:18am, the stock was trading at Rs 965.35, up Rs 4.45, or 0.46 percent on BSE. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 974.00 and an intraday low of Rs 963.60.

The net debt at the end of the quarter stood at Rs 54,504 crores with Net debt to EBITDA of less than 1.0X. “We remain committed to our annual deleveraging target of $1 billion in line with our capital allocation strategy to reduce our debt,” said Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer.

“We expect that volatility in terms of steel price and input cost movement to continue in the next quarter but expect the spreads to stabilise in the second half of the year”, added Chatterjee. “The volatility in commodity prices and immediate impact of the export duty in India have led to an increase in working capital but our cost improvement and other initiatives along with expected pickup in demand in the second half of the year should result in normalisation of working capital”.

Global research firm JP Morgan has an overweight call on the stock with target at Rs 1,400 per share, an upside of 45 percent from current market price. The company witnessed substantial all around beat driven by Europe. ""While Q2 is seasonally weak, H2 should rebound with large Q1 beat on Europe EBITDA per tonne at $365 per tonne.

On the other hand, domestic research and broking firm ICICI Securities has a reduce rating on the stock. According to its report, Tata Steel's consolidated EBITDA surprised on the back of strong Tata Steel Europe (TSE) EBITDA. TSE EBITDA expanded to USD 365 per tonne (up USD 120 per tonne QoQ) with support from contract realisations, favourable RM movement and lower energy costs.

""Negative EBITDA for Tata Steel Long Products is attributed to higher thermal coal prices as well as NRV provisions of Rs 780 million on coking coal and iron ore. We maintain reduce rating with an unchanged target price of Rs 827 per share as we wait for the EBITDA contraction cycle to play out (we expect the downcycle to last 4-5 quarters with peak being attained in Q2FY22),"" it added.

The performance for the quarter was impacted by the higher pet coke prices which resulted in an increase in operating costs, while the export duty imposed by the Government of India, choked up the exports which had a negative impact on the volumes.

“This has been a challenging quarter for the Global and Indian economy with rising interest rates, supply chain constraints and slowdown in China due to COVID, but despite these multiple headwinds, Tata Steel has delivered a strong performance with an improvement in margins”, said T V Narendran, Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director while commenting on the performance for the quarter.

“Our strong marketing franchise and superior business model in India enabled us to successfully pivot and increase our domestic deliveries to counter the 15 percent duty imposed on steel exports in the middle of the quarter and we continue to drive value accretive growth in India backed by investments in customer relationships, brands and distribution networks and remain well positioned to benefit from the buoyant automotive & retail housing demand and the government spend on infrastructure”, he added.

The company’s European business delivered a sharp improvement in performance as long term contracts and product mix helped drive a strong increase in realizations.

Volumes

The company produced 7.74 MT (million tons) of steel during the quarter on a consolidated basis which was 1.8 percent lower as compared to 7.88 MT produced during the same period last year but was 1.6 percent higher on a sequential basis.

The consolidated sales volume during the quarter were impacted by the imposition of exports duty and other macro factors. The sales volume during the quarter came in at 6.62 MT which was 7 percent lower on year and 17.4 percent lower on a sequential basis.

Revenue per ton for India operations rose by Rs. 8,534 QoQ to Rs. 83,625 per ton while Revenue per ton for its European operations increased by £154 QoQ to £1,248 per ton aided by long term contracts and product mix.

Margins

The consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) for the quarter stood at Rs 15,047 crores which was flat on a sequential basis but dipped 7 percent as compared to the same period a year ago.

On QoQ basis, EBITDA margin improved to 24 percent while EBITDA per ton increased by Rs 3,780 to Rs 22,717. While comparing with the same period last year, the EBITDA per ton remained flat.

The EBITDA of India operations stood at Rs 9,582 crores, resulting in an EBITDA per ton of Rs 23,557 while the European operations achieved highest ever quarterly EBITDA at £621 million, which resulted in an EBITDA per ton of £290.

Business Updates

Tata Steel’s subsidiary, Tata Steel Long Products, completed the strategic acquisition of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited on July 4 and the company expects this acquisition will drive growth of its long products business.

“We are geared towards commissioning the 6 MTPA pellet plant at Kalinganagar in Q3FY23 which will drive cost savings followed by the CRM complex and the 5 MTPA expansion project”, added Narendran. The company spent Rs 2,725 crores on capital expenditure in line with its annual capex guidance on its Kalinganagar expansion.

The company’s 10:1 stock split has received the necessary approvals and July 29 has been set as the record date to give effect to the split.

Debt

The Net debt at the end of the quarter stood at Rs 54,504 crores with Net debt to EBITDA <1.0X. “We remain committed to our annual deleveraging target of $1 billion in line with our capital allocation strategy to reduce our debt”, said Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer.

Outlook

“We expect that volatility in terms of steel price and input cost movement to continue in the next quarter but expect the spreads to stabilise in the second half of the year”, added Chatterjee. “The volatility in commodity prices and immediate impact of the export duty in India have led to an increase in working capital but our cost improvement and other initiatives along with expected pickup in demand in the second half of the year should result in normalisation of working capital”.

India’s largest steel producer Tata Steel Limited (Tata Steel) is expected to report a year-on-year decline of 19-32 percent in its consolidated profit after tax (PAT) on July 25, when it will declare its results for the quarter ended June 2022. On a sequential basis, the decline in profit is likely to be more pronounced at 26 – 38 percent.

The revenues are likely to grow 9-16 percent over the same period a year ago. On a sequential basis however, the revenues are seen decreasing by 11-16 percent.

According to a poll of brokerages that Moneycontrol had access to, including Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Kotak Institutional Equities and ICICI Securities, the Tata Group company is expected to report a PAT of Rs 6,000 – 7,200 crore on consolidated revenues of Rs 59,300 – 61,700 crore.

Tata Steel had registered a PAT of Rs 8,907 crore during the corresponding period last year when it had achieved consolidated revenues of Rs 53,372 crore.

Its PAT during the January – March 2022 period stood at Rs 9,756 crore on consolidated revenues of Rs 69,324 crore.

The performance of the company during the quarter was impacted by decline in volumes due to the imposition of export duty as well as increase in coking coal costs which inflated the operating costs.

“We estimate steel realization to increase 4 percent QoQ (+11 percent YoY) led by front-ended price hikes in Q1FY23 and expect volumes to decline 3 percent YoY (-22 percent QoQ) at 3.9 million tons (MT) on lower domestic demand impacted by higher prices and lower exports impacted by imposition of export duties”, a report from Kotak Institutional Equities said.

Consequently, the brokerage expects India EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) per ton to decline 20 percent QoQ to Rs 18,780/ton (a YoY decline of 44 percent) impacted by higher coking coal costs.

ICICI Securities on the other hand, expect Tata Steel's standalone operations to report an EBITDA/tonne of Rs 20,500/ton (compared to an EBITDA/ton of Rs 23,690/tonne in Q4FY22). It expects European operation steel sales to come in at ~2.16 MT, down 7 percent YoY and 10 percent QoQ.

“For Q1FY23E, we expect European operations to report an EBITDA/ton of $250/tonne as compared to an EBITDA/ton of $241/tonne in Q4FY22”, a report from ICICI Securities said.

Consolidated EBITDA margins for the quarter are likely to come in at 19.0 - 21.1 percent compared to 22.9 percent in the previous quarter and 30.2 percent during the same period a year ago.

The investors will be focusing on the management’s comments on the debt of the company especially after paying of $12.6 billion for the acquisition of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL). The plan for the revival of NINL will also be in focus along with the timelines for the commissioning of expansion at Kalinganagar plant.

Other points to focus on will be the management’s views on coking coal costs in the coming quarters, contracts from automobile players as well as the export mix.

Tata Steel Ltd opened flat at Rs 935 on July 25 at The National Stock Exchange. In the year 2022, the stock had touched a high of Rs 1,370.75 on April 8 but since then it retraced back to as low as Rs 838.1 on June 22. The stock has seen reversal of trend since then and has appreciated 11.7 percent in the past one month.

Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Tata Group chairman, said the firm had been in talks with the government for two years over funding for Tata’s transition to greener steel production.

“We should come to an agreement within 12 months. Without this, we will have to look at closures of sites,” Chandrasekaran told the newspaper.

Homegrown Tata Steel has partnered with Australia-based BHP to jointly explore low carbon 'iron and steelmaking' technology.

The partnership aims to help both companies progress toward their climate change goals, and support India’s ambitions to be carbon-neutral by 2070, the domestic steel major said on July 20.

Tata Steel has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with BHP, a leading global resources company, with the intention to jointly study and explore low carbon 'iron and steelmaking' technology, it said in a statement. Under the partnership, Tata Steel and BHP intend to collaborate on ways to reduce the emission intensity of the blast furnace steel route, via two priority areas the use of biomass as a source of energy and the application of carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) in steel production.

The new technology is to reduce the emission intensity of integrated steel mills by up to 30 per cent. More importantly, these projects demonstrate how abatements applied to the blast furnace iron-making process, which contributes to more than 60 per cent of India’s steel production, can materially reduce the carbon intensity of the existing capacity.

Rajiv Mukerji, Vice President, Group Strategic Procurement, Tata Steel, said, ""We believe strategic collaborations are vital in paving the way for innovations to accelerate the deployment of breakthrough technologies at scale and therefore this partnership with BHP is an important step for us"". According to a ministry document, the iron and steel industry globally accounts for around 8 per cent of total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on an annual basis, whereas in India, it contributes 12 per cent to the total CO2 emissions.

Thus, the Indian steel industry needs to reduce its emissions substantially in view of the commitments made at the COP26 climate change conference.",300,0.8615190188090006

Tata Steel has signed an agreement with Australian mining and metals company BHP to jointly study and explore low-carbon iron and steelmaking technology, the Indian steelmaker said in a statement.

Under the partnership, Tata Steel and BHP plan to reduce emission intensity through the use of biomass as a source of energy and the application of carbon capture and utilisation in steel production. The partnership aims to support India’s ambition to be carbon neutral by 2070. The technologies can potentially reduce the emission intensity of integrated steel mills by up to 30 percent.

“These projects demonstrate how abatements applied to the blast furnace iron-making process, which contributes to more than 60 percent of India’s steel production, can materially reduce the carbon intensity of the existing capacity,” the company said in the statement.

Apart from this, Tata Steel and BHP will explore further collaborations, ecosystems and business opportunities in the steel value chain and research and renovation sectors in India and Australia.

Tata Steel has undertaken various initiatives towards carbon neutrality. It has an agreement with Shell India Markets to evaluate and co-develop short- and long-term options to improve energy efficiency and optimise demand around carbon-intensive products and services.

Tata Steel and the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research are collaborating on carbon capture and utilisation, opening the doors for joint development of advanced technologies with 38 CSIR labs.

The Indian steel industry has reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions substantially by adopting appropriate technologies in modernisation and expansions projects. The average CO2 emission intensity of the Indian steel industry has reduced from about 3.1 tonnes/tonne of crude steel (T/tcs) in 2005 to 2.6 T/tcs by 2020, as per a PIB report dated February 2, 2022.

Tata Steel has planned capital expenditure (capex) of Rs 12,000 crore on its India and Europe operations during the current financial year, the company's Chief Executive Officer T V Narendran said.

The domestic steel major plans to invest Rs 8,500 crore in India and Rs 3,500 crore on the company's operations in Europe, Narendran, who is also the Managing Director (MD) of Tata Steel, told PTI in an interview.

On Tata Steel's CAPEX plans for FY23, he said: ""We have planned for about Rs 12,000 crore of capex for the year of which about Rs 8,500 crore will be spent in India and the balance in Europe."" In India, the focus will be on the Kalinganagar project expansion and mining activity, and in Europe, it will be focussed on sustenance, product mix enrichment and environment-related capex, Narendran said.

The company is in process of expanding capacity of its plant in Kalinganagar, Odisha to 8 MT from 3 MT.

In addition to this, Tata Steel will be spending about Rs 12,000 crore on inorganic growth in India in the NINL acquisition, he said.

Tata Steel through its wholly-owned subsidiary Tata Steel Long Products Limited (TSLP), completed the acquisition of Odisha-based one Million Tonne Per Annum (MTPA) steel mill NINL for a consideration amount of Rs 12,000 crore.

Elaborating on the European business, he said it has been divided into the Dutch business and the British business.

""This allows us to run Tata Steel as one integrated company with five major sites, three in India and two in Europe. This brings greater focus on each of our operating sites. The European sites have been tasked with becoming self-sufficient,"" he said.

On Tata Steel's interest in acquiring state-owned Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), he said the company did not have a dedicated large site to produce long products in its portfolio. However, the NINL acquisition has plugged this gap.

On the duty-related measures taken by the government, Narendran said ""I fully understand and appreciate the compulsions of the government in taking actions that they did to control inflation. However, in the medium to long-term, we should actively be positioning India as one of the best places to produce steel in the world."" Narendran, who is also part of the Executive Committee of the apex steel body World Steel Association said the Russia-Ukraine conflict has impacted the global geopolitical order and the global economic order and hence the steel industry in multiple ways.

The pandemic had already encouraged companies to look not just at cost efficiencies in supply chains but also to build resilience in supply chains.

""On the supply side input costs like cost of coal and cost of gas have been significantly impacted by the war. Russia and Ukraine together used to export about 30 to 40 million tonnes of steel into the global markets and that supply has also got disrupted. Inflationary pressures arising out of the war have disrupted plans for government infrastructure spending across the world,"" he said.

On the outlook for the steel sector, the industry veteran said the first half of the financial year was disrupted due to the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war, the COVID-related shutdowns in China, and the imposition of export duty on steel in India.

""I expect the second half of the financial year to be more positive than the first half as I expect the demand growth for steel in India to be strong based on the continued focus on infrastructure spend.

""Steel pricing would have also stabilised after absorbing the impact of the export duties. I also expect China to recover from the economic impact of the COVID shutdowns in the first half. So overall I am positive about the prospects of the industry for the rest of the year,"" Narendran said.

Tata Steel is among the top three steel producing companies in the country. According to Narendran the company produces close to 20 million tonnes in India.

As per the World Steel Association, India's crude production was at 118 million tonne (MT) in 2021.",681,0.2000025987625122

Stocks of steelmakers from the likes of Tata Steel, JSW Steel and SAIL jumped on Monday after sources said the government is considering a proposal to discontinue a 15 percent export duty on certain steel products.



Tata Steel, JSW Steel, JSPL and Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) jumped around 3-5 percent in afternoon deals.

The government will consider the industry's proposal to discontinue the 15 duty on exports of certain products before the end of the monsoon season, sources told CNBC-TV18.

A decision is yet to be taken on the exemption of export duty for steel, they added.

The Finance Minister had recently assured industry leaders, following a meeting with Tata Steel, SAIL, JSW Steel, JSPL and ArcelorMittal, that the government will relook on the duty on certain products.



Major steelmakers have lost market capitalisation as margins were under pressure amid slow domestic demand and high export duties resulting in a loss of overseas customers.



In a bid to tackle soaring inflation, the government had imposed 15 percent export duty on steel on May 22 which had sent steel stocks into a downward spiral and triggered earnings downgrades for the sector.



Despite the uptrend in share price of steelmakers, it is “too premature and early for the govt to relook at the export duty,” Rakesh Arora, Founder of goindiastocks.com, told CNBC.



“I don't see any case for export taxes to be revoked… even if the export duty is removed, which is highly unlikely, the impact on domestic prices is likely to be like negligible. In fact, today, the import parity price is Rs 2,000-3,000 per tonne lower than the domestic price. So, even if you reduce the export duty to zero, domestic prices will still have to fall because imports can come in, given that global prices are much lower,” Arora added.",305,-0.6741278648376465

Tata Steel is aiming to restart the 1 million tonne (MT) NINL steel mill in next three months time, its CEO & MD T V Narendran said on Wednesday.

Tata Steel on Monday completed the acquisition of NINL through subsidiary company Tata Steel Long Products (TSLP) for a consideration of Rs 12,000 crore.

The Odisha-based plant has been closed for almost two years.

Tata Steel's next move will be to take ownership of NINL and work hard along with employees and other stakeholders to realise the full potential of the asset, Narendran told PTI on a query on the company's future strategy with respect to the newly acquired steel plant.

''We are ready to work with existing employees and restart the plant which has been closed for almost 2 years. We hope to get the production started in the next 3 months and ramp up to the rated capacity over the next 12 months,'' the top official said.

During this time, Tata Steel will also work towards finalising the plans for the NINL capacity expansion to 5 million tonnes and take the requisite clearances internally and externally.

On January 31, Tata Steel announced winning the bid for acquiring 93.71 per cent stake in Odisha-based steel maker NINL.

When asked about the reason for the delay in the acquisition process, he said ''It took some time as there were multiple issues to be resolved between the multiple shareholders of NINL and us.'' Besides 1 MT steel mill, NINL has its own captive power plant to meet the internal power requirement and air separation unit for producing Oxygen, Nitrogen and Argon.

It also has its own captive iron ore mines which are under development.

In the statement, Tata Steel said that TSLP has completed the acquisition of 93.71 percent in NINL, a joint venture of four central public sector enterprises — MMTC, NMDC, BHEL, MECON — and two Odisha government public sector units — OMC and IPICOL. The acquisition has been completed as per the terms and conditions of the share sale and purchase agreement entered on March 10, 2022 and in accordance with the process carried out by the Department of Investment & Public Asset Management (DIPAM).

T V Narendran, CEO & Managing Director of Tata Steel and TSLP chairman, said ""The acquisition is a historic achievement and a significant milestone towards building a dedicated long products facility for the Tata Steel Group. The completion of the transaction is a testimony to government of India’s focus on its disinvestment programme. The acquisition also reflects our commitment to Odisha and the communities around its operations. We are delighted to welcome NINL and its employees to our family.""

According to the statement, the long product segment in India is poised to witness significant growth as India builds its infrastructure through government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat programme along with the pickup in the retail housing segment in semi-urban India.

Tata Steel will leverage its capability in the long products business using its strong brand equity, particularly in the retail construction segment, and its extensive, pan-India retail and distribution network to drive scale in long products.

Tata Steel Ltd will continue to reduce debt by around $ 1 billion a year but the company does not aim to reduce it to net debt zero levels given its expansion plans, Chairman N Chandrasekaran told shareholders at the company’s 115th Annual General Meeting on June 28.

The company aims to spend Rs 10,000 crore-Rs 12,000 crore a year on capital expenditure going ahead, but may spend more if an acquisition opportunity arises, he said. The capex would be focused on India, and the company has no plans to spend more on adding capacity at its overseas plants.

“The main thing is to have the right capital structure, and not blindly go for zero debt. Currently our debt to equity ratio and the debt to EBITDA ratio are both less than one. The company has a capital structure which is very strong and taking to zero debt can make the company's capital structure inefficient,” said Chandrasekaran.

This was Chandrasekaran’s first Tata Steel AGM after he was reappointed as the Tata Group's chairman for a second term of five years in February.

DELEVERAGING

The Tata Steel chief said that the company will continue to to deleverage to maintain the key ratios at comfortable levels.

“We will continue to reduce the debt because we know that the EBITDA level may not be at this level always. But with the capacity expansion that we are currently planning, the company is comfortable to create a good level of EBITDA. So we will continue to reduce the debt but the intent is not to take it to zero debt,” he said.

Tata Steel’s gross debt stood at Rs 75,561 crore at the end of fiscal 2021-22 after the company repaid a debt of Rs 15,232 crore during the year. The company has a stated strategy of reducing debt by $ 1 billion (around Rs 7,896 crore) every year.

“We reduce it (debt) by $1 billion certainly, and probably more. We have a target towards which we are going but we will calibrate the target as we continue to expand,” Chandrasekaran said.

CAPEX

The steelmaker’s capex plan, around Rs 10,000 crore-Rs 12,000 crore a year, would be mostly India centric.

“Europe and the UK will be capped; we have no additional plans of expansion in this market. Our plan for expansion is in India. We are set to go from 20 million tonnes to 30-40 million tonnes,” Chandrasekaran said.

The company’s ongoing expansion plans at the Kalinganagar and Angul plants will take the capacity to 25 million tonnes. The company will also undertake organic expansion at its recently acquired Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL) plant to increase the capacity to 1.1 million tonne per annum within the next one year.

“Our capital expenditure plan per year is a minimum of Rs 10,000 crores to Rs 12,000 crore; we are looking at this capex primarily because it's difficult to execute and build more capacity in a year, that's what our experience shows. But otherwise, we definitely want to expand faster and reach our targets of 30 and 40 million tons,” he said.

The company said that the growth plan would continue to be governed by the demand forecast, size of business opportunity, scope for enhancements in the product portfolio and overall balance sheet impact, while aligning to the changing regulatory imperatives.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE IMPACT

The Chairman said that while 2022 started on expectations of a year of high growth, the Russia-Ukraine war and the resulting geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions have led to rising commodity and energy prices and supply shortages globally.

As commodity and energy prices remained elevated, the global inflation surged beyond 7.5 percent, indicating stagflationary headwinds which are expected to dampen global GDP this year, he said.

“The Russia situation has definitely increased the fight in the market and the steel price in Europe is quite strong. For that reason, the new contracts that the UK entity and Europe entity have entered into are quite attractive. The EBITDA and cash level performance of the Europe and UK entity is expected to be stronger this year than all the previous years,” he said.

He also said that Tata Steel has not been sourcing coal from Russia since it made a statement to that effect on April 20; it is sourcing additional coal from Australia.",744,0.20695890188217164

Tata Steel Chairman N Chandrasekaran on June 28 said the company, after completing acquisition, will boost the operation of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL) to rated capacity of 1.1 million tonne per annum within the next one year.

However, the ramping up of the operations of NINL would be subject to obtaining statutory clearances.

""Post-acquisition, we will endeavour to ramp up the operations of NINL to its rated capacity of 1.1 million ton per annum within the next 1 year, subject to obtaining statutory clearances,"" Chandrasekaran said in his address to shareholders during the company’s 115th Annual General Meeting.

Tata Steel arm, Tata Steel Long Products (TSLP), in January this year won the bid to acquire a 93.71 percent stake in NINL at an enterprise value of Rs 12,100 crore, leaving behind the likes of a consortium of Jindal Steel and Power Limited, Nalwa Steel and Power Ltd, and JSW Steel Limited.

A top official of the steel company last month said that Tata Steel will complete the acquisition of NINL by the end of the first quarter of FY23. The company, Chandrasekaran said, made significant acquisitions during the year in areas of long products, mining, and advanced materials adding that the most notable among these, is the buyout of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd for an aggregate consideration of Rs 12,100 crore.

""The acquisition is particularly important considering the proximity of the NINL plant to our Kalinganagar plant and its potential to become the hub for long products business in the near future,"" he said. Towards organic growth, Tata Steel continued to accelerate its capital allocation for the 6 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) pellet plant and 2.2 MTPA cold rolling mill complex as part of the five MTPA expansion at Kalinganagar.

The 6 MTPA pellet plant will be commissioned in the third quarter of the ongoing fiscal, followed by the cold roll mill complex and the 5 MTPA expansion, which will drive cost savings and product mix enrichment. In Europe, Tata Steel achieved complete separation of its UK and Netherlands operations, in October last year.

Under the new structure, Tata Steel UK and Tata Steel Netherlands will operate as two independent companies pursuing separate strategic paths. The company’s growth plans continue to be governed by the demand forecast, size of business opportunity, scope for enhancements in its product portfolio and overall balance sheet impact while remaining cognizant of changing regulatory imperatives.",404,0.9989074865976969

In 1988, when Chanakya Chaudhary joined Tata Steel as a young graduate, an engineer trainee, little did he know that he would have to climb mountains to pick up lessons on endurance, team spirit, and leadership.

Four years before Chaudhary came on board, the home-grown steel major had set up Tata Youth Adventure Centre, today popularly known as the Tata Steel Adventure Foundation. This was initiated by the legendary mountaineer Bachendri Pal, the first Indian woman to climb Mt Everest. Chaudhary, who is the current vice-president of corporate service at Tata Steel, shares Tata Steel’s less-known legacy in sports with Storyboard18.

The company started Tata Youth Adventure Centre as an outbound leadership institute to push trainees to withstand unpredictable situations. Chaudhary and a team of trainees had to reach Uttarkashi through several tough treks. He admits, to date, it is one of the most challenging exercises he took up. The programme was extra special because of the presence of the legendary mountaineer (Pal). She never let them give up, even when an avalanche hit their trail. The journey to Uttarkashi taught Chaudhary and his team lessons that they would never have got in a closed-door induction session. Since then he believes “Sports is a way of life.”

The JRD Tata Sports Complex was inaugurated March 2, 1991.

Steel and Sports

Tata Steel was established in India as Asia's first integrated private steel company in 1907. Over the last century, the company has made several historic marks in the area of sports. In 1920, Tata Steel’s first chairman Sir Dorabji Tata personally financed the first Indian team for the Antwerp Olympics 1920. That was 27 years before India even got its Independence. The six-member all-male team had four athletes and two wrestlers.

Since then, the company has encouraged and invested in talent and provided infrastructural support. Chaudhary says the brand has been mindful and has believed in the power of inclusivity and diversity. For instance, in 1927 Tata Steel established the Jamshedpur Athletic Club and started sports competitions for working men, women and their children. “We started working on areas like workplace ergonomics, keeping in check work-life balance, much before they became buzzwords. We believe sports has been helping us to bridge several need gaps,” adds Chaudhary.

So, with the credentials and work to back it up, why doesn’t Tata Steel actively promote and advertise its sports initiatives? Chaudhary says, “The company doesn’t believe in beating their own trumpet. We think we are a doer brand and we like our work to speak for itself.”

The only time Tata Steel advertised its contribution to sports was in the year 1989. The brand’s ‘We Also Make Steel’ ad campaign was one of its kind to highlight a company’s social welfare initiatives and not its products and services. It was a TV commercial that touched on Tata Steel’s contribution across several spheres – from technology and education to agriculture, sports, defence and social welfare.

An eye for opportunities

Over the years, though Tata Steel has supported individual sports personalities, the brand has moved on to support individual sports. Chaudhary says this strategy has helped the brand to create platforms that will enable sportspersons to generate livelihood in the long run and of course help them represent the country on a global stage. He says this is like an ‘end-to-end’ solution that the brand is offering to nurture the sports culture.

Not a one-sport nation

The company also invests in sports beyond the national favorite - cricket. For instance, in 1987, Tata Football Academy (TFA), the first-of-its-kind residential football academy in the country, was launched. Tata Archery Academy was established in 1996, and has produced many champions like Deepika Kumari, Jayanta Talukdar, Atanu Das, Limba Ram, who have represented India in the Olympic games.

In 2017, Tata Steel Hockey Academy was established in Jamshedpur and Bhubaneshwar. The company also runs training centres in 19 different sporting disciplines at the JRD Tata Sports Complex in Jamshedpur that trains approximately 2,500 children every year.

Chess was added to the roster in 2018. The company has a long-standing association with chess, having been the main sponsor of the famous chess tournament at Wijkaan Zee, The Netherlands, which is one of the most prestigious events in the international chess calendar.

A recent addition is climbing. The company has launched India’s first sports climbing academy. Sports climbing debuted in Tokyo Olympics 2021 and will subsequently feature in Paris 2024 and Los Angeles 2028.

Chaudhary says it’s a massive opportunity, and the brand is focused to develop a complete ecosystem for sports climbing – from grassroots to academy to professional athletes.

Bachendri Pal became the first Indian woman to climb Mt Everest in 1984.

Keeping the promise alive

At a time when cricket still takes the biggest bite out of many marketers’ ad budgets, Chaudhary says, there are many sports events that have sprung up over the last few years - from badminton, volleyball, handball to chess, pushing boundaries and giving confidence to players to build their careers around it.

Chaudhary says the biggest contribution that India Inc. can make is to create enough sports infrastructure, that’s for the long run. It creates a pipeline to support sportspersons in a much larger way. “If more corporates do their bit to create infrastructure, the overall sports ecosystem will take care of itself,” he adds.

That apart, he also points out that there is a common misconception in the corporate world that CSR funds should be invested in sports. He has a different take. “Some bit of the CSR funds can be used for sports development initiatives but there are other priorities that need the money and attention. Bigger brands can’t park all their CSR funds for sports.”

Nine athletes from Tata Steel participated in the 1982 Asiad.

Ratings agency Moody's Investors Service on June 27 revised the outlook on Tata Steel to ‘positive’ from ‘stable’. At the same time, Moody's also affirmed Tata Steel's Ba1 corporate family rating (CFR).

""Today's outlook change to positive reflects Tata Steel's track record of delivering a solid operating performance while maintaining conservative financial policies; and the likelihood that upward rating pressure will build over the next 12 months if recent performance and credit metrics improvements are sustained,"" Kaustubh Chaubal, Moody's Senior Vice President, said in a press release.

Moody's expects the company to reduce its debt by at least $1.0 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2023 (fiscal 2023) -- aligned with its publicly articulated capital allocation policy.

""Tata Steel's well-laid-out capital allocation policy that prioritizes debt reduction over capital expenditure and new investments underscores our positive outlook. The substantial debt reduction achieved over the last two years, as well as the reduction to come over the remainder of fiscal 2023, will greatly improve the company's financial flexibility and resilience and position it for an investment-grade rating,"" Chaubal also said, the press release stated.

In its ratings rationale, Moody’s highlighted that market conditions will gradually moderate over the next 12-18 months.

The ratings firm said in its note that the structural improvement in Tata Steel's capital structure, with an absolute gross debt reduction and the substantial cash generated by the company during the last two fiscal years, has created a lasting buffer to the company's key credit metrics and liquidity, reducing the company's overall credit risk.

Moody’s said rising global interest rates to curb inflation and an increase in Indian steel export taxes have somewhat dampened steel prices. It also said its forecasts for Tata Steel are based on the rating agency's current price sensitivities for steel ($880 per ton for Tata Steel's Indian operations and $1,250/ton for Europe) for fiscal 2023.

Moody's has modeled per ton of metallurgical coal at $308 and iron ore at about $100. For fiscal 2024, it said its forecasts are based on the mid-point of its price sensitivity ranges ($600-$800/ton for steel, $80-$125 for iron ore and $110-$180 for metallurgical coal).

These price sensitivities translate into an EBITDA/ton assumption of $280 for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 for Tata Steel's Indian operations, a 30% decline over fiscal 2022, Moody’s Investors Service said in its note.

Moody's remains cautious in its forecasts and assumes that the business' EBITDA/ton will decline from $180 in fiscal 2022 to around $140 -$150 in fiscal 2023 and further slide to $40 -$50 in fiscal 2024.",438,0.03338371962308884

Tata Steel is working on a plan for transition to low carbon technologies for making steel in the UK and the Netherlands. In October 2021, Tata Steel completed the process of separating Tata Steel UK and Tata Steel Netherlands as two independent companies from Tata Steel Europe.

Both, Tata Steel UK and Tata Steel Netherlands have been developing detailed plans for transition to low CO2 technologies in line with the company's goal to produce CO2-neutral steel by 2050 in Europe, company's CEO & MD T V Narendran and Executive Director & CFO Koushik Chatterjee said.

""In Tata Steel Netherlands, we plan to gradually phase out our blast furnaces and coal over the next 10 years by replacing them with a combination of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) technology based on hydrogen, and electric furnaces,"" the executives said in the company's annual report for 2021-22.

In the Netherlands, the company has a capacity of 7 MTPA. According to the company, Tata Steel UK also produces steel through blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnace routes, and has an annual capacity of 5 million tonne per annum (MTPA). According to the company, Tata Steel UK also produces steel through blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnace routes, and has an annual capacity of 5 million tonne per annum (MTPA).

Speaking on the India operations, the company said, ""Based on our assessment of the opportunities in the Indian market, we will calibrate our growth plans and timing for implementation. We are currently focussed on completing our expansion project in Kalinganagar to create a state-of-the-art 8 MTPA site.""

During 2022-23, Tata Steel will be commissioning a pellet plant, which is 70 per cent complete, and the phase-wise commissioning of the cold rolling mill complex, starting with the pickling line and the cold rolling mill.

Both are margin expansionary projects as part of the overall expansion project in Kalinganagar. This expansion in Kalinganagar is focussed on higher value-added products including plates, coated products, advanced high strength steels and products for newer applications.

As part of its mid-term plan, capacity addition in India using scrap Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) route will also be set up to convert the collected and processed scrap into steel.

""There are also plans for shifting from metallurgical coal to cleaner fuel like natural gas, upscaling pilots of CCU (carbon capture units) and hydrogen based steel-making in India.

Thyssenkrupp has lost its fight against a European Union antitrust veto of its proposed landmark joint venture with Tata Steel, after Europe's second-highest court rejected its arguments.

The two companies in 2019 had sought to tackle over-capacity and other challenges in the steel industry via the joint venture, which would have created Europe's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal.

But the European Commission said the deal could result in significant price hikes and demanded remedies Thyssenkrupp at the time said would jeopardise the logic of the planned transaction.

The EU competition enforcer in its 2019 decision said the companies had not offered sufficient steps to address concerns, forcing it to block the deal and Thyssenkrupp to challenge the finding at the Luxembourg-based General Court.

""In today's judgment, the General Court rejects all the arguments raised by the undertaking and upholds the Commissions decision,"" the Court said on Wednesday.

Thyssenkrupp can appeal on matters of law to the Court of Justice of the European Union, Europe's top court.

The case is T-584/19.

Thyssenkrupp, which has since explored and rejected an attempt to sell its steel division to Britain's Liberty Steel, said it had taken note of the decision.

""We remain of the opinion that the EU Commission's blocking of the joint venture with Tata Steel Europe in 2019 was a disproportionate step,"" the company said.

Tata Steel has not made any purchase of PCI coal from Russia post its April announcement of severing business ties with Russia amid the ongoing conflict with Ukraine, a company spokesperson said on June 22.

On April 20, Tata Steel had said it would stop doing business with Russia. To ensure business continuity, all its steel manufacturing sites in India, the UK and the Netherlands have sourced alternative supplies of raw materials to end its dependence on Russia.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tata Steel

We believe Tata Steel standalone’s 1HFY23 EBITDA is likely to contract by 66% over 1HFY22 driven by lower ASP, lower demand and peak coking coal costs and high base effect. India operations will not benefit from lower iron ore costs or discounted Russian coal. Hence, the cost structure will only benefit from the reduction in coking coal prices that too for 70-75% of requirement as India operations are captive on coking coal for the balance. We cut our FY23E consolidated EBITDA by 22%, driven by 34% reduction in standalone EBITDA, partially offset by 4% increase in TSE EBITDA. The reduction in domestic EBITDA is driven by: a) lower than expected sales volume, b) reduction in ASP and c) higher than estimated coking coal cost.

Tata Steel share price came into focus after Citi maintained a buy call on the stock. The stock has tanked over 32 percent in the last 3 months amid inflation, interest rate hikes and export duty concerns.

At 09:50 am, the stock was trading at Rs 877, up Rs 15.80 or 1.83 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 882.00 and an intraday low of Rs 865.10.

Metal stocks have been under pressure from lockdowns and slowdown in China. Central banks raising interest rates to mitigate inflationary pressures and an expected economic slowdown are also major reasons for the decline.

The government surprised the industry with an export duty with effect from May 22. The duty is 50 percent on all grades of iron ore, 45 percent on pellets and 15 percent on non-alloy steel except part of semi-finished steel.

According to the Indian Steel Association (ISA), the duty on steel would send a negative signal to investors and impact capacity utilisation. India could lose export opportunities and the decision could impact overall economic activity, it said.

Analysts said that duty on iron ore may result in higher domestic supply and will likely bring down prices. For steel firms like Tata Steel, JSW Steel and JSPL, exports account for 15-20 percent of overall sales.

Global research firm Citi has retained a buy rating on Tata Steel but has cut target to Rs 1,085 from Rs 1,800 per share. It has cut EBITDA estimate by 32/34% on lower realisations.

India's top steelmaker Tata Steel imported about 75,000 tonnes of coal from Russia in the second half of May, two trade sources and one government source said, weeks after pledging to stop doing business with Russia.

Tata Steel had said in April all its manufacturing sites in India, the UK and the Netherlands had sourced alternative supplies of raw materials to end its dependence on Russia, adding it was taking ""a conscious decision to stop doing business with Russia.""

Still, in May, Tata Steel shipped about 75,000 tonnes of PCI coal, used in steelmaking, from Russia's Vanino port, out of which 42,000 tonnes were offloaded in a port in Paradip on May 18 and 32,500 tonnes in Haldia, said the two trade sources who wished to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak on the matter.

A spokesman for Tata Steel said the deal to import coal from Russia was made before the company's announcement to cut business ties with Russia, without providing further details.

""There has been no other PCI Coal purchase by Tata Steel from Russia after the announcement,"" the spokesman said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

India has refrained from condemning Russia - with which it has longstanding political ties - over what Moscow describes as its ""special operations"" in Ukraine. India has instead defended its purchase of Russian goods as a bid to diversify supplies and argues that a sudden halt would boost prices and hurt consumers.

Tata Steel was the only major steelmaker to announce it would stop doing business with Russia. Other Indian steelmakers have been importing bulk quantities of coal from Russia, trade data reviewed by Reuters showed.

The PCI coal was imported in a vessel named Panamax Ostria, the trade sources said. The government source confirmed Tata Steel had imported 75,000 tonnes of coal from Russia in May, but did not give more details.

Details on Tata Steel's Russian coal imports have not been previously reported.

Purchases of Russian coal by Indian buyers including steelmakers have spiked in recent weeks despite Western sanctions on Moscow, as traders offer discounts of up to 30%, Reuters reported on Saturday.

Cheap coal supplies are especially crucial to Indian steelmakers now, as they are reeling from export duties imposed by the Indian government last month to curb local inflation.

The Nifty metals index (.NIFTYMET) has fallen over 20% since the decision to levy export taxes on May 21, with Tata Steel falling about 26%, JSW Steel (JSTL.NS) declining 12% and Jindal Steel and Power's (JNSP.NS) shares losing 21% of their value since the announcement.",433,-0.892310897509257

Tata Steel has unveiled a 7-million pound investment plan for its Hartlepool Tube Mill in north-east England that the Indian steel major says will cut carbon emissions, improve capacity and reduce costs to strengthen its UK business.

The investment will go into a new slitter which will allow the Hartlepool site to process coils of steel delivered from Tata's Port Talbot steelmaking site in South Wales. All of the steel products made at the site, where almost 300 people work producing up to 200,000 tonnes of steel tubes a year, are 100 per cent recyclable and the investment is forecast to pay for itself in less than three years. This project will allow us to bring a vital process on site, which in turn will free up thousands of tonnes of capacity at the Port Talbot site, Andrew Ward, Works Manager of Tata Steel in Hartlepool, said last week.

This will improve our efficiency and reduce overall CO2 emissions from our steel processing as well as reducing the total costs across the business, he said. Currently, wide steel slabs are slit in Port Talbot before being rolled and sent to Hartlepool to be turned into steel tubes, which are then used in a wide range of products such as agricultural machinery, sports stadiums, steel-framed buildings and the energy sector.

The new project is expected to take more than a year to complete and is the second major investment announced by the Indian company in the UK this year after an investment plan for its site at Corby in the north-eastern England region. Both projects will further strengthen the UK business, improving services to customers and using the latest available technology to reduce environmental emissions, Tata Steel UK said. Andrew Ward added: Above all, safety will be a key factor in this investment both during the construction phase and when the new slitter is up and running. It will feature the latest computer-controlled technology, which reduces the need for our employees to be close to any hazardous operations and it will be as energy-efficient as possible.

The new slitter line will optimise the UK value chain for our smaller tube product range, allowing steel coil to flow through the chain and provide flexibility with on-site slitting . This investment will support the ongoing drive to improve customer delivery performance and responsiveness which the Hartlepool 20 Mill team pride themselves upon. Tata Steel in the UK says it has the ambition to produce net-zero steel by 2050 at the latest and to have reduced 30 per cent of CO2 emissions by 2030. The vast majority of that work will need to happen in South Wales, where the company's largest operational site is. Tata Steel says it is developing detailed plans for this transition to future steelmaking based on low CO2 technologies and is close to knowing which will best help achieve its ambitions. Tata Steel in the UK says it has the ambition to produce net-zero steel by 2050 at the latest and to have reduced 30 per cent of CO2 emissions by 2030.

The steel giant is one of Europe's leading steel producers, with steelmaking in the Netherlands and the UK, and manufacturing plants across Europe. The company's tube products are used across a broad range of industries, including construction, machinery fabrication, energy and automotive. Next week, the company will be at the Wire and Tube 2022 fair in Dusseldorf, Germany, after a long gap due to the coronavirus pandemic. After the last few years, we are really looking forward to this opportunity to connect with so many customers in one place and showcase our broad tube portfolio, said Anil Jhanji, Chief Commercial Officer for Tata Steel UK.

We are making major investments to further strengthen our Tubes business and, as we come out of the coronavirus pandemic, I look forward to meeting all our customers to demonstrate how we can help them succeed in their markets, added Tony Waite, Tata Steel Director of Sales Tubes and Engineering.",669,0.9931377410888672

Welspun Corp Ltd (WCL) has partnered with Tata Steel to develop the ""framework for and subsequently manufacturing"" pipes for transportation of pure hydrogen and natural gas-blended hydrogen.

While Welspun Corp Ltd, the flagship company of Welspun Group, is a leading welded line pipe manufacturer, Tata Steel is among the top three steel making companies in India.

""Welspun Corp Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd have signed an MoU to jointly work towards developing the framework for and subsequently manufacturing green pipes for the transportation of pure hydrogen and hydrogen blended with natural gas,"" WCL said in a statement.

The green energy strategic partnership with Tata Steel is to assess the suitability of a variety of pipes manufactured by WCL for the transportation of the fuel of the future, which will aid in mitigating climate change-led issues and build a secure future for posterity, it said.

This MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) will enhance the general understanding and knowledge of the transportation of hydrogen globally, Welspun Corp said.

In October 2021, Welspun Corp had joined the H2Pipe Joint Industry Project on Hydrogen Pipelines launched by leading industrial certification body DNV AS Energy Systems Pipeline Technology.

It was a global industry project to develop the ""world's first guideline"" for transportation of hydrogen gas in existing and new offshore pipelines. Vipul Mathur, Managing Director & CEO, Welspun Corp Limited, said: ""We are working towards strengthening its expanding product portfolio both in India and globally while focusing on building a future-ready world.""

Rajeev Singhal, Vice President Marketing & Sales (Flat Products), Tata Steel, said: ""The partnership is an important step in our journey towards sustainability.

""This will enable us to jointly develop steel for safe transportation of hydrogen gas which is a critical requirement for adoption of hydrogen fuel in line with the government's National Hydrogen Mission.""",368,0.9305124402046203

Tata Steel has further expanded its transgender employee base by hiring transgender people in its core mining operations. “Tata Steel has onboarded transgender people as Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) Operators and Crane Operator Trainees at its mines,” the Indian steel giant announced on social media Wednesday.

Tata Steel says it is the first Indian company to open core mining operations to the transgender community. The recruitment of transgender employees is part of the company’s efforts to enable a diverse and inclusive work culture, it said.

In December 2021, Tata Steel’s West Bokaro Division onboarded 14 transgender people as HEMM Operators in its mines. A few months later, in February 2021, it recruited 12 Crane Operator Trainees from the LGBTQ+ community at its Kalinganagar plant.

Tata Steel has been certified as a gold employer under Workplace Equality Index for LGBT+ workforce. LGBTQ+ refers to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and related communities.

Gold employers are those that have “successfully embedded LGBT+ inclusion in their policies, hiring practices, external communication, demonstrating a long-term and in-depth commitment towards LGBT+ inclusion,” according to Workplace Equality Index, a benchmarking tool for LGBTQ+ inclusion in the workplace.

Other ‘gold level’ employers include Google, Microsoft, Deloitte, IBM, Accenture and more.

These efforts to mainstream the transgender community are consistent with Tata Steel’s ethos of diversity and inclusion. “The Company has taken several path-breaking initiatives, including menstrual leaves, equal benefits for LGBTQ+ partners, gender neutral parental leaves, and support for gender confirmation,” the steelmaker said in a press release dated February 2022.

“Tata Steel is committed to creating a diverse, inclusive, safe and fair workplace and has taken a target of having 25 percent diverse workforce by 2025.”",300,0.9560537536938986

The market remained under selling pressure throughout the week ended May 13 with the Nifty50 losing 4 percent on the back a weakening rupee against the US dollar, inflation concerns, apprehensions of faster policy tightening by the central banks, and lockdowns in China.

The index made attempts two-three times to rebound but failed and closed the week way below psychological 16,000 mark and near the lows of this year (15,671), indicating bears are in strong position. Experts feel if it breaks the same low then there is a possibility of panic selling which can bring the index down to 15,200 levels in the coming days.

The Nifty50 lost 275 points from the day's high to end with 26 points loss on Friday at 15,782 and formed a bearish candle on the daily charts. During the week, it fell more than 600 points and saw a bearish candle formation on the weekly scale.

""'The recent low of 15,671 is not far from the current levels now and the moment we slide below it, it will create a panic kind of situation in the market. Below this, 15,350-15,200 are the next levels to watch out for,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

On the flipside, he feels 16,000-16,200 has now become a stiff hurdle. The first sign of relief is possible only above these levels. Till this time, one should avoid trading aggressively in the market, he suggested.

""If we take glance at the weekly time frame chart, we can see sheet anchor in the form of '89-EMA' (exponential moving average) placed around 15,600. Historically, this moving average has proved it's mettle and has provided cushion to severe falls. It would be very interesting to see how market behaves around it,"" Chavan said.

Hence, although the trend is strongly bearish at this moment, Sameet advised investors with a slightly broader time frame, should start nibbling in quality propositions in a staggered manner.

Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the May 13 closing prices:

Expert: Nandish Shah, Senior Derivative & Technical Analyst at HDFC Securities

Coromandel International: Buy | LTP: Rs 883 | Stop-Loss: Rs 820 | Target: Rs 1,000 | Return: 13 percent

The stock price has broken out from the symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart. Primary trend of the stock is positive as it is trading above its all-important short term and long-term moving averages.

Momentum oscillators like RSI (relative strength index) and MFI (money flow index) are placed above 60, indicating strength in the current uptrend of the stock. We expect current outperformance of the stock to continue for the coming weeks.

Delta Corp: Buy | LTP: Rs 222 | Stop-Loss: Rs 205 | Target: Rs 250 | Return: 13 percent

The stock price has reached near to the support of 100 weeks EMA (exponential moving average) which is placed at Rs 220 odd levels. Primary trend of the stock is positive as it is trading above its 100 and 200 days EMA.

The stock price has corrected nearly 35 percent from the recent high and reached near to the multiple support level. MFI Oscillator is placed above 60 on the weekly chart, indicating strength in the stock.

Bharat Electronics: Buy | LTP: Rs 219 | Stop-Loss: Rs 205 | Target: Rs 240 | Return: 10 percent

Primary trend of the stock is positive as it is trading above its 200 days EMA. Stock price has corrected nearly 15 percent from the recent high and reached near upward sloping trendline support. MFI Oscillator is placed above 60, indicating strength in the stock.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Siemens: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,300.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,100 | Target: Rs 2,550 | Return: 11 percent

The stock is forming a rectangle consolidation formation between Rs 2,550 and Rs 2,150 levels. The stock rebounded on positive news- flow after hitting a low of Rs 2150.

The entire sector is performing well and the stock is forming a bullish pattern which would help take the stock to Rs 2,550 in the near term. It is a buy at current levels and more on dips. Place the last stop-loss at Rs 2,100.

Tata Motors: Buy | LTP: Rs 404.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 350 | Target: Rs 470 | Return: 16 percent

Since the start of the new financial year, the stock was under tremendous selling pressure, falling from the level of Rs 462 to Rs 366. However, the stock jumped sharply after the announcement of the Q4 numbers and returned nearly 50 percent of all the fall.

Technically, it is a positive for the stock, as it will strengthen the buying breadth for the stock. The strategy should be to buy at Rs 405 and more at Rs 380 on dips. However, we need to protect a long position with a stop-loss at Rs 350.

At higher levels, it will retest Rs 470 level again in the medium to long term.

Tata Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,097 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,000 | Target: Rs 1,300 | Return: 19 percent

The stock is approaching a key support area, which lies between Rs 1,050-1,100 level. Over the past 12 months, the stock has offered significant support to the stock at various times.

In the current sell-off, the stock is getting oversold by the time it reaches the support area. The ideal strategy should be to initiate long positions at current levels and more on dips at Rs 1,060.

To protect the long position, the stop-loss should be at Rs 1,000. On the higher side, the stock can again move back to Rs 1,300 levels where it has resistance of the falling trend line.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Godrej Consumer Products: Buy | LTP: Rs 797.2 | Stop-Loss: Rs 744 | Target: Rs 870 | Return: 9 percent

After corrective phase, the stock has recently changes its trend as prices have formed a 'Higher High Higher Low' on the daily charts. On last Friday's session, prices gave a breakout above the falling trendline resistance with good volumes.

The ‘RSI Smoothened’ oscillator also gave a positive crossover hinting at a positive momentum.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 797-794 for potential target of Rs 870 in next few weeks. The stop-loss for short positions can be placed below Rs 744.

ONGC Futures: Sell | LTP: Rs 154.2 | Stop-Loss: Rs 162 | Target: Rs 140 | Return: 9 percent

Prices have recently consolidated in a range which has led to formation of a ‘Triangle’ pattern. The stock is on a verge of a breakdown from the support end of the pattern which is a negative sign.

Also, the ‘RSI Smoothened’ oscillator on the daily charts in hinting at a negative momentum and hence, we expect some price-wise correction in the near term.

Traders can look to sell the stock in the futures segment below Rs 153 for potential targets of Rs 140 and Rs 134. The stop-loss for this trade should be placed above Rs 162.

Expert: Ajit Mishra, VP-Research at Religare Broking

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 889.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 830 | Target: Rs 1,030 | Return: 16 percent

We are seeing a mixed trend within the auto pack and M&M has been trading strongly closer to its record high despite the prevailing market correction.

The recent dip towards the support zone of major moving averages is offering a fresh buying opportunity. We recommend accumulating within Rs 880-890 levels.

Canara Bank Futures: Sell | LTP: Rs 191.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 210 | Target: Rs 165 | Return: 14 percent

In line with ongoing correction, Canara Bank has witnessed a breakdown from a distribution pattern, after spending nearly 7 months in a consolidation range.

It has also slipped below the support zone of the trendline on the daily chart and the fresh breakdown in the banking index is added negative. We thus recommend creating shorts within Rs 195-200 zone.

Manappuram Finance Futures: Sell | LTP: 98.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 113 | Target: Rs 82 | Return: 17 percent

Manappuram has been witnessing correction for the last six months after making a new record high in November 2021. In continuation to the prevailing phase, it has slipped below the previous swing low, indicating more downside ahead. We thus recommend creating shorts on an uptick within the 100-104 zone.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tata Steel

On a standalone basis, revenue/EBITDA/APAT grew 73%/33%/40% YoY to INR367b/INR122b/INR79b in 4QFY22. Revenue and EBITDA were broadly in line, while APAT was 9% above our estimate, led by a marginal 4% beat on EBITDA, lower-than-estimated finance cost, as well as higher other income. On a consolidated basis, TATA reported a revenue/EBITDA/APAT of INR693b/INR150b/INR100b in 4QFY22, up 39%/6%/31% YoY. The consolidated result was in line as other segments and forex adjustments offset the beat in its European result. One-time provisioning of INR13.4b (INR5.4b towards inventory write-off and INR8b towards shortfall in meeting its mining dispatch target after the acquisition of mines) was made in other subsidiaries. TSE’s (Tata Steel Europe) earnings were a surprise, with an EBITDA/t of USD241 (est. USD178), even though ASP was in line. TSE continues to ride the steel price boom in Europe after the ban on steel exports from Russia and unavailability of steel from Ukraine.

Outlook

The stock trades at 4.3x/4.4x our FY23/FY24 EV/EBITDA estimate. On a P/B basis, the stock is quoting 1.2x/1.1x our FY23/FY24 estimate. We maintain our Neutral rating with a revised SoTP based TP of INR1,440 share (from INR1,500 earlier).

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Steel

TATA steel (TATA) reported Q4FY22 EBITDA below our estimates by 13% at Rs158.9bn (down 5.4% QoQ/+6% YoY). The miss was primarily due to lower than expected margins in India operations and one-time provision of Rs13.4bn in Tata steel mining, the mining subsidiary. While Tata steel Europe (TSE) delivered strong beat of 47% on back of higher prices. Continued relaxation of policies for real-estate sector and front loading of infrastructure spending reflects visible pressure on Chinese authorities to stimulate economic activity given the meaningful slowdown witnessed over last couple of quarters and reemergence of covid-19. While, concerns on oversupply resulting from contraction in demand were addressed by commensurate curbs on production by authorities. Unlike past, this limited the intensity of Chinese mills to dump steel in exports markets. Amid low competitive intensity of Chinese mills and constrained steel supplies from Russia and Ukraine, abnormal coking coal prices at US$520/t would remain pressure point for earnings of steel companies.

Outlook

Notwithstanding that, margins of Indian steel mills are significantly better than historical levels on back of elevated spreads. Underpinned by solid B/S, sound earnings outlook (with FY23e margins lower by 23% over Q4FY22) and attractive valuations, we reiterate BUY with TP of Rs1,705, EV/EBITDA of 5.7x FY23e.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after earnings:

JPMorgan

The foreign research house has kept an overweight rating and raised the target price to Rs 1,940 per share.

""It was another year of earnings upgrades given strong Europe and India show with Europe EBITDA per tonne at $241 and capex guidance muted,"" it said.

JPMorgan increased FY23 earnings per share estimate by 24 percent, CNBC-TV18 reported.

Jefferies

The brokerage has maintained a hold rating on the stock with a target at Rs 1,240.

EBITDA fell five percent while adjusted EBITDA was flat sequentially.

EBITDA miss was driven by weak performance of non-TSE subsidiaries, CNBC-TV18 reported.

Motilal Oswal

""The European business has surprised us positively and it could report a strong EBITDA for the next one to two quarters as well,"" the brokerage said.

""However, with China’s economy slowing down, we expect steel prices to come under pressure. Further, India will be entering into a monsoon season in the next two months, which will cap any further price hikes from the current level (that is anyways close to an all-time high),"" it added.

The strong FCF (free cash flow) supports downside while peak steel prices and coking coal prices cap any further margin expansion from current levels.

""We maintain our neutral rating with SoTP-based (sum of the parts) target price of Rs 1,500,"" the brokerage said.

At 09:20 hrs Tata Steel was quoting at Rs 1,298.20, up Rs 3.10, or 0.24 percent on the BSE.

Tata Steel Ltd has planned capital expenditure (capex) of Rs 12,000 crore for 2022-23, which may increase after the company does a mid-year review of its growth plans, the management told reporters in a conference call.

Of the planned capex, around Rs 8,500 crore-Rs 9,000 crore would be on projects in India, while the balance would be on international projects.

“Our capex for the year is Rs 12,000 crore, we will review it after six months and take a call on how we are progressing,” said TV Narendran, chief executive officer and managing director.

“We believe we can deleverage and grow,” he said.

The management said that the capex amount may be increased after the half-year review as the company may finalise a multi-year capex programme.

Koushik Chatterjee, executive director, and chief financial officer said, “Our cash outflow for the capex in the year (FY22) was Rs 10,522 crore, which is well within our earlier guidance. We continue to focus on deleveraging while advancing our strategic growth priorities; our focus is on the completion of the Kalinganagar expansion. Tata Steel has generated strong free cash flows of Rs 27,185 crore for the year despite higher working capital, taxes, and capex.”

On May 3, Tata Steel reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,835.12 crore for the quarter ended March 2022, up 37.3 percent on-year, despite a significant surge in international coal prices and the inflationary impact of various commodities. India’s largest steelmaker reported 39 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in consolidated revenue at Rs 69,323.50 crore during the fourth quarter, with India operations reporting a 34 percent growth. European business for the company clocked 53 percent growth in the same period. The firm also announced a stock split at 10:1.

“The coal cost has been very volatile, but the expected impact on coal cost in this quarter to be $100 per ton higher than last quarter in India and about 50 euros per ton higher in this quarter compared to the previous quarter (overseas),” Narendran said.

The company is upbeat about domestic demand, even as commodity prices continue to be high.

“We are expecting demand in India to continue to be strong. There's been some hesitation to buy because there was a concern that the steel prices are too high and of course, it was hurting some of the customers as far as working capital is concerned. People are also watchful to see what's happening in the international market. Fundamentally, the demand has been strong in India, commercial and passenger vehicles have been strong and construction activity is picking up as infrastructure spend is growing,” Narendran said.

He said that the international demand will be “reasonably strong” despite concerns over China demand slowing due to the COVID impact given the global infrastructure spend and the disruption of supply from Russia and Ukraine.

Deleveraging to Continue

Tata Steel’s gross debt stood at Rs 75,561 crore at the end of fiscal 2021-22 after the company repaid a debt of Rs 15,232 crore during the year.

The company said that net debt declined to Rs 51,049 crore, which led to an improvement in net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation) ratio at 0.80 and net debt to equity ratio to 0.52.

“For deleveraging, we have a policy for many years now of a billion-dollar every year, which we've been overperforming in the last three years. This policy continues. If we look at our cash flows, we have been deleveraging at a much higher rate than that,” Chatterjee said.",626,0.9919679835438728

A Bloomberg consensus estimate of 12 brokers had said the net profit would come in at Rs 9,462 crore while revenue was pegged at Rs 66,195.50 crore.

""Tata Steel has again demonstrated its ability to deliver stellar results despite heightened complexity in the face of COVID as well as geopolitical tensions,"" T V Narendran, Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director said.

Narendran further said Indian business showed broad-based growth. European operations delivered robust performance as the transformation programme undertaken helped leverage the strong business environment.

Tata Steel Ltd is likely to deliver a strong set of numbers on Tuesday, when it comes out with its March quarter earnings, according to experts.

The company is likely to report a consolidated revenue of Rs 68,737 crore in March quarter, up 38 percent from a year ago, led by strong improvement in realisations in both India as well as in Europe. Consolidated net profit may surge 44 percent on-year to Rs 9,580 crore. Sequentially, both revenue and profit are likely to be flat.

However, consolidated margins are likely to contract sharply mainly due to higher iron ore prices, while domestic margins are likely to fall amid higher coking coal prices. EBITDA margins may fall to 22.5 percent in the quarter from 28.4 percent a year ago and 26.1 percent last quarter.

Analysts are likely to keep an eye on the management commentary on profitability and cash flow from European operations, and update on growth capex.

Let's check out what analysts are expecting from Tata Steel's Earnings.

Prabhudas Lilladher

Tata Steel's standalone volume is expected to grow sharply by 17 percent quarter on quarter (QoQ) to 5 million tonnes. Realisations are expected to fall by 2.5 percent or Rs 1,900 per tonne QoQ to Rs 73,380 per tonne. Due to a fall in realisations and higher costs, domestic EBITDA/t would fall by 8 percent/Rs 2,300 QoQ to Rs 26,360.

Tata Steel Europe (TSE) operations is expected to report EBITDA/t of $200, up 10 percent on-quarter due to volume expansion and improvement in spreads. Owing to strong performance in TSE partially offset by fall in margins in domestic operations, Prabhudas Lilladher expects consolidated EBITDA to grow by 8.6 percent QoQ to Rs 17,300 crore.



Kotak Institutional Equities

The brokerage estimates steel realisation to decline 2 percent on-quarter (up 56 percent YoY) impacted by back ended price hikes in Q4FY22. It expects volumes to increase 6 percent YoY (+12 percent QoQ) at 4.9 million tonnes (MT) on higher exports and improved domestic demand. India EBITDA/tonne to decline 11 percent QoQ to Rs 24,561 a tonne (+25 percent YoY) impacted by higher coking coal costs.

The brokerage firm estimates Europe EBITDA/tonne at $206 per tonne (+12 percent QoQ,+214 percent YoY) to benefit from higher prices in the region and lower costs on a consumption basis. Axis Capital



Revenues to grow due to higher steel prices and steel deliveries. Tata steel has released provisional production and deliveries. Group Steel deliveries are higher at 13 percent QoQ and 4 percent YoY.

EBITDA is expected to marginally increase as the impact of higher raw material costs (coking coal) is offset by higher steel prices and margin pressure due to higher coking coal prices. PAT and EPS to broadly follow the EBITDA growth.

IDBI Capital

Tata Steel‘s topline is expected to grow 23 percent YoY in Q4FY22 led by strong improvement in realisations in both India as well as in Europe.

However, its consolidated EBITDA is likely to decrease by 1.9 percent YoY mainly due to fall in spreads at its European steel business.

Edelweiss Research

Tata Steel domestic EBITDA to be impacted by higher coking coal prices for domestic operations. Shipments up owing to blended realisation expected to be flat QoQ. Profitability expected to be impacted by higher coking coal prices.

Tata Steel Europe EBITDA to be impacted by higher iron ore price as well.

Experts expect ferrous and non-ferrous metals companies to deliver robust revenue growth year on year (YoY) fuelled by a surge in commodity prices and robust sales volumes. With the escalation of conflict in Eastern Europe, the market priced in the risk of supply disruption and consequently aluminium and steel prices rallied further on a sequential basis.

The Russia-Ukraine conflict resulted in several Russian banks getting barred from accessing the international payments messaging system – SWIFT. Overnight, it became difficult to settle trades in aluminium, steel, coking coal, nickel, alumina, and thermal coal, resulting in a shortage of these commodities globally and pushed certain commodity prices to record highs.

“The companies’ EBITDA margins, however, are expected to remain flattish or marginally decline YoY and quarter on quarter (QoQ) mainly due to higher coal and energy prices,” a report from Axis Securities said.

Coking coal and iron ore prices for steel companies have jumped sharply which will impact the margins in the fourth quarter (Q4FY22). Power costs for aluminium smelters, too, are expected to go up due to the jump in coal prices. The rise in input raw material inflation will partially offset the gains from strong prices and sales volumes and will keep the margins flattish.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects revenue of metals companies to grow 39 percent on a YoY basis, but sees EBITDA growing only 2.4 percent and PAT (profit after tax) 7.5 percent, given the sharp jump in input costs, especially for steel companies.

“Sequentially, we expect a surge of 15 percent in revenue, but EBITDA/PAT is likely to remain moderately higher (two/five percent) as input cost push negates the benefit of higher steel prices,” Motilal Oswal said.

Ferrous metals/steel performance

Traditionally, fourth quarter is the strongest in terms of demand, sales volumes, prices, and profitability. However, this trend witnessed a complete breakdown as prices of steel remained sluggish in the first half of Q4FY22 as international prices continued to slide.

A COVID-induced slowdown in China impacted steel prices, which continued to correct in January 2022, before recovering in February. The exceptionally strong price push in March was driven by a massive jump in coking coal prices and resurgence in domestic demand.

That said, steel manufacturers were able to pass a majority of surge in input costs to consumers during the quarter, but the outlook for Q1FY23 does not seem good.

Kotak Institutional Equities Research said, “An average increase in steel realisation of Rs 2,000-2,500 per tonne QoQ (a sequential increase of 2-3 percent) is expected during the quarter”.

This increase in realisation is led by back-ended price hikes in the domestic and export markets; $40-50 per tonne increase in coking coal costs during the quarter; marginal moderation in domestic iron ore prices; and a sharp sequential increase in volumes led by seasonality and pick-up in exports.

Kotak expects the volume of Jindal Steel & Power Ltd to grow by 2 percent on year, JSW Steel volumes are likely to grow by 23 percent YoY, volumes of SAIL by 9 percent and Tata Steel volumes may increase by 6 percent on year.

The brokerage expects the profitability of steel players to decline on a sequential basis due to higher costs, partly offset by higher realisations.

“We estimate EBITDA per tonne for Tata Steel at Rs 24,561 (-11 percent QoQ), JSW Steel at Rs 16,240 (-8 percent), Jindal Steel & Power at Rs 16,512 (-5 percent) and SAIL at Rs 9,436 (-6 percent)”.

Motilal Oswal, on the other hand, expects EBITDA per tonne for steel players to contract between 5 and 58 percent on quarter, with Jindal Steel & Power being the least impacted due to its minimal dependence on coking coal and JSW Steel due to the implementation of biggest price hikes. “We expect EBITDA per tonne for SAIL to contract by 58 percent QoQ as it is the most leveraged to coking coal prices,” the brokerage said.

Non-ferrous metals performance

The prices of non-ferrous metals rallied sharply, led by a fundamental shortage in certain commodities like aluminum and nickel, and surging energy prices, especially in Europe which impacted the margins of energy-intensive non-ferrous commodities like aluminium. This led to a shutdown of production at several smelters in Europe and resulted in a steep hike in commodity prices. With the supplies from two of the major exporters -- Russia and Ukraine -- getting disrupted, the deficit in several commodities started reflecting in prices.

“Base metal companies in Q4FY22 would benefit from higher commodity prices and a weaker rupee, while higher volumes due to seasonality would also aid earnings,” Kotak said.

Zinc prices increased 10 percent on quarter to $3,721 per tonne, aluminum prices surged 19 percent sequentially to $3,272 per tonne while alumina prices were flat on quarter at $421 per tonne.

Hindalco —Kotak estimates Hindalco’s India EBITDA (standalone + Utkal) at Rs 3,920 crore, a growth of 112 percent on year and a sequential growth of 12 percent aided by higher commodity prices partly offset by higher costs.

Hindustan Zinc Ltd —“We expect EBITDA to increase by 8 percent QoQ to Rs 4,700 crore which is a growth of 22 percent YoY, led by higher prices partially offset by weaker volumes and cost inflation,” Kotak said.

National Aluminium Company Ltd —Kotak estimates NACL’s Q4FY22 EBITDA at Rs 1,390 crore, increasing by 113 percent on year and by 17 percent QoQ.

Vedanta Ltd —“We estimate consolidated EBITDA to increase 19 percent on quarter to Rs 12,800 crore, a growth of 42 percent YoY which is led by higher margins in the zinc, aluminium and oil and gas divisions.

Tata Steel's Europe arm recorded a six percent surge in output in FY22 at 10.12 mt, and the total deliveries increased by two percent in the same period to 8.99 mt, a statement said. During Q4 FY22, however, the production was down by nine percent QoQ to 2.33 mt ""due to operational issues primarily in UK"", it noted.

Tata Steel Thailand's annual production during the fiscal came in at 1.29 mt, which was lower as compared to 1.33 mt in FY22. The quarterly production marginally increased to 0.34 mt as compared to 0.32 mt in Q3 FY22.",296,0.999925285577774

Tata Steel's blast furnaces in the UK are using billions of microscopic bacteria to convert its emissions into stock materials for other industries to make recycled products such as food-packaging to animal feed, the Indian steel major has said.

A pilot project, led by the University of South Wales, has been set up at the two Tata Steel UK Port Talbot ironmaking furnaces in Wales. The project, while still in its infancy, has already shown promising results, the experts involved said last week.

""As the world is coming to terms with the challenges of net-zero CO2 steelmaking, there are lots of options to consider. Not only in terms of different steelmaking technologies, but also around any opportunities to capture and use the carbon-based process gases,"" said Dr Rhiannon Chalmers-Brown from the University of South Wales. ""The process we are testing here bubbles off-gases from the blast furnaces through sewage sludge, which contains a certain type of bacteria able to consume both carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2),"" she said.

Dr Chalmers-Brown said the team was getting quite high levels of carbon utilisation, which they feel can increase up to about 98 per cent. ""The waste products from those bacteria include acetic acid and volatile fatty acids which can be used for a huge range of commercially viable end-uses such as paints, bioplastic-polymers or even animal feeds,"" she noted.

The project is a collaboration between Tata Steel and the university exploring how waste gasses from the steelmaking processes at Port Talbot can be harnessed and used to support other industries while reducing the amount of CO2 released. Dr Chalmers-Brown added: While this pilot is looking at gases from blast furnaces, pretty much every iron and steelmaking technology emits some carbon-based gases, so this technology has potential to reduce those emissions whichever technology route is eventually chosen.

There's still quite a lot of work to do with the pilot reactor, collecting data and to understand what we can about the biological reactions."" Tata Steel said it is developing detailed plans for this transition to future steelmaking based on low CO2 technologies.

""This is a great project, which could be a real game-changer and is yet another example of the benefits of working closely with some of our top universities, said Gareth Lloyd, Process Engineering Manager from Tata Steel and industry sponsor. Tata Steel in the UK said it has an ambition to produce net-zero steel by 2050 at the latest and to have reduced 30 per cent of CO2 emissions by 2030.

The vast majority of that work will need to happen in South Wales, where the company's largest operational site in the UK is. Tata Steel is the largest steelmaker in the UK with primary steelmaking at Port Talbot in South Wales, supporting manufacturing and distribution operations at sites across Wales, England and Northern Ireland as well as Norway and Sweden.

Tata Steel employs more than 8,000 people and has an annual crude steel capacity of 5 million tonnes. The Indian steel giant said it works on supplying high-quality steel products to demanding markets, including construction and infrastructure, automotive, packaging and engineering.",532,0.999954104423523

Despite several risks emerged in the second half, the market has delivered solid returns of 19 percent since last Holi festival though it is still 7.5 percent off its record highs reached in October 2021.

Every sector participated in the run with Metal and Power being the largest gainers with 56 percent and 59 percent returns, respectively, followed by IT and Realty that surged 37 percent each. Oil & Gas, Capital Goods, Energy and Healthcare indices gained 16-32 percent, while Auto, Finance and FMCG underperformed others, registering 8-9 percent gains.

Consistent buying by DIIs amid hopes of strong earnings growth and economic growth ahead despite margin pressure in some sectors in the short term on rising commodity prices, and continuity in low interest rate environment still supported the market, though huge FII selling amid expectations of faster policy tightening by global central banks including Federal Reserve, and sharp rising in commodity prices (including oil and metals) and sanctions imposed on Russia by western world after Russian invasion of Ukraine capped the gains in second half.

The broader markets also participated in the run with BSE Midcap index rising 19 percent and Smallcap index climbing 37 percent.

Experts expect the volatility in next few months to continue due to Ukraine-Russia war and sanctions imposed on Russia, but having positive view on the market for the medium-to-long-term perspective, they advised buying quality stocks on every major dip and expect at least 10-15 percent market gains by next Holi.

""The challenge at every stage that will face markets is demand side growth coming through. There will be hiccups at different stages and the reasons could vary (sitting three months back, I do not believe anyone could predict or factor the geo-political risk and oil prices settling above $100 a barrel),"" says Naveen Chandramohan, Founder and Fund Manager at ITUS Capital.

He further says rather than worrying about the risks, he would use this macro uncertainty to pick up good businesses which continue to grow cash flows, reinvest capital and gain market share. ""There are multiple businesses that are doing this, and our focus would be on the micro.""

Here are nine picks (mix of largecap, midcap, and smallcap) suggested by the market experts and portfolio managers that can be added to your portfolio to gain healthy returns by next Holi:

Expert: Sonam Srivastava, Founder, Wright Research

HDFC Bank

In a rising interest rate environment, banks stand to gain the most as banks and financial organizations have significant cash holdings due to customer balances and business activities that would yield high interest. On a company-specific level, recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lifted all restrictions on HDFC Bank, permitting it to launch new digital initiatives.

As a result, the loan growth has picked up, and an uptick in net interest income (NII) growth is a big positive. We expect a market share in credit cards to stabilize and improve asset quality trends for HDFC Bank.

The bank has a reasonable valuation with high return on equity (ROE) from the valuation perspective. HDFC Bank has maintained a consistent profit growth for many years and has excellent projections.

Tata Elxsi

Tata Elxsi is a multibagger midcap IT stock that outperformed last year. Tata Elexi offers end-to-end engineering solutions to their clients. Tata Elxsi is valued on the pricier side, but the revenue and profit growth is among the highest in the sector for these stocks, and it also maintains a good profit margin.

It has a good ROE and a lot of cash on hand to spend on Capex. Companies across the globe are investing in R&D to produce enticing products, which improves the prospects for an engineering research & development company like Tata Elxsi. Tata Elxsi plans to focus on electric, automated, and connected vehicles (EACV), 5G, Medical Electronics, AI & ML-driven innovative solutions, etc., in the future.

The high-interest rate environment that can inflate the currency Tata Elexi is attractive because of its global exposure.

Tata Steel

Tata Steel has been the buzzing stock for the last year due to the upcycle in metal prices. Tata Steel is one steel sector stock that has outperformed all others. With the rising profitability due to rising steel prices, Tata Steel has cleared a lot of debt from its balance sheet and deleveraged.

The Russia Ukraine crisis has also made this stock attractive as it is serving as an alternate to the Russian-made steel for European customers. Tata Steel has a significant European presence, contributing to a bulk of revenues.

In terms of fundamentals, the valuations are below the industry average, and the profit growth has been exceptional. We expect Tata Steel to have robust prospects with a global focus on infrastructure.

Expert: Divam Sharma, Founder at Green Portfolio

Valiant Organics

The larger the distortion the more attractive the stock is. Valiant Organics has been a story we have been following for several years that is in the specialty chemicals space.

The fundamentals of the company have continuously unravelled, and yet the price has been on a decline. Zooming in, the company is producing negative cash, because the revenues are being ploughed into capex, and this capex will prove to be of tremendous value when the manufacturing begins in these new plants.

Most if not all the capex is oriented to manufacturing chemistries that are in direct competition to what China has been supplying. Solid margins, low debt, extremely comfortable valuations, and upcoming capacity ramp-up support our overall thesis.

KSB

KSB is an MNC available at comfortable valuations. The company manufactures pumps and valves for various industries.

The compelling rhetoric is the utility of these pumps. One of the segments their pipes find utility is in the FGD (flue gas desulphurization system) and nuclear space. The installation of FGD pumps in coal-powered plants is a necessity now and the company staging themselves to be a large beneficiary with the timely capex.

With the company's steady and strong order book; up trending fundamentals; healthy cashflows; and double-digit margins, we have a high conviction on its long-term performance.

Adani Wilmar

Adani Wilmar commands an 18.3 percent market share in edible oil. The company is the biggest oleo synthetic producer in India.

Considering ambitious plans, we expect food and industry essential business to grow for the company over the coming quarters.

The stock looks attractive at current valuations.

Expert: Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services

ICICI Bank

ICICI Bank continues to witness strong growth in retail deposits and has succeeded in building a robust liability franchise over the past few years.

The bank enjoys one of the lowest funding costs among private banks, which enables it to underwrite profitable business without taking undue Balance Sheet risk.

We expect slippages to moderate significantly over FY22-24 and credit cost of 1.2 percent and 1.1 percent in FY22 and FY23 respectively for ICICI Bank.

ICICI Bank continues to remain top pick in the sector given its journey to deliver solid return ratios and growth.

Macrotech Developers

Lodha is one of the largest real estate developers in India, benefitting from the recent demand pick-up and the optimism behind the expected upcycle.

Macrotech Developers is expected to benefit from: a) its around Rs 20,000 crore of completed and near-complete inventory, b) Rs 4,000 crore of QIP money to enable healthy JV/JDA (joint venture/joint development greement) deal addition, c) monetization of industrial land banks and ready commercial projects, and 4) substantial deleveraging potential through robust cash flow.

Lodha is our top pick for its favourable balance between growth potential, improving financial strength, and compelling valuations.

Zensar Technologies

The deal pipeline is strong, comprising a large number of small- and medium term deals, and the management is confident about the deal momentum given the rich demand environment.

The management expects the EBITDA margin to remain in the mid-teens for the next 3–4 quarters before reverting to the high teens as the strategy execution is completed. It further highlighted that decreasing reliance on sub-contractors would be another margin lever.

The addition of 1 client each in the $10 million+ and $20 million+ buckets in Q3 indicates Zensar's progress in diversifying its client base. Since Ajay Bhutoria assumed the reins as CEO, Zensar has doubled its $20 million+ accounts to 4 that was stagnant for last 4 years. Reducing exposure to its top client is also a positive as this lowers the concentration risk.

We believe that its new sales-led strategy should help the company return to the high-teen organic growth path in FY23. We estimate USD revenue growth of 21.8 percent for FY23, up from 15.4 percent in FY22, led by sustained deal inflow and a good exit to FY22.

India’s stock market snapped a four-week losing streak and clocked a more than 2 percent gain in the week ended March 11 after global equity counterparts bounced back, commodity prices fell and the BJP won four of the five state assembly elections.

It was an action-packed week for the market as the Nifty 50 faced resistance about the 20-day moving average (16,767) as well as the 200-day exponential moving average (16,693) and failed to end above them after touching a seven-month low of 15,671 during the week.

If the index closes decisively above 16,750-16,800, it could head towards 17,000 and beyond, which can be an indication that 15,671, the low touched last week, could act as a bottom. On the flip side, 16,450-16,200 could be support levels for the index, experts said.

The Nifty 50 gained 385 points, or 2.37 percent, to close at 16,630.45 and formed a Bullish Engulfing pattern on the weekly charts, which is a positive sign for the market.

“16,750-16,800 remains a key hurdle and any sustainable move above this would confirm the March 8 low as a bottom. On the flipside, 16,450 followed by 16,200 are the immediate supports,” said Sameet Chavan, chief analyst-technical and derivatives, at Angel One.

He expects some consolidation in the key indices and adjustments to continue in individual stocks. For the week ahead, in case of a consolidation, one should focus on stock-specific moves, which will provide excellent trading opportunities, Chavan said.

According to Santosh Meena, head of research at Swastika Investmart, the bulls have to take the Nifty above the 17,000 level to come back aggressively in the game otherwise there is a risk that the bears may once again become active.

Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on March 11 closing prices:

Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst at HDFC Securities

Laurus Labs: Buy | LTP: Rs 578 | Stop-Loss: Rs 535 | Target: Rs 640 | Return: 11 percent

After showing a gradual rise as per the higher highs and higher lows in the past few months, Laurus Labs witnessed a sharp upside breakout. The stock price moved above the crucial resistance of the consolidation area at Rs 557 levels on March 11 and closed higher. There is a higher possibility of further extension in the upside momentum in the coming week.

Volumes had started to expand during the upside breakout in the stock price and the weekly 14 period relative strength index (RSI) shows a positive indication. One may expect further strengthening of the upside momentum in the stock price.

Buying in Laurus Labs can be initiated at Rs 578, add more on dips down to Rs 555, and wait for the upside target of Rs 640 in the next 3-4 weeks. One can place a stop-loss of Rs 535.

Prism Johnson: Buy | LTP: Rs 126 | Stop-Loss: Rs 117 | Target: Rs 140 | Return: 11 percent

The sharp downtrend in Prism Johnson over the past seven weeks seems to have ended after it showed a decisive upside breakout recently. We observed the formation of a Bullish Engulfing pattern, as per the weekly timeframe chart, which signals the formation of an important bottom reversal for the stock price at the Rs 110 level.

The weekly candle pattern indicates an engulfing of the past three weeks’ range on the upside in one week. Volumes expanded during the upside breakout on March 11 and the weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication.

One may look to buy Prism Johnson at Rs 126, add more on dips down to Rs 121 and wait for the upside target of Rs 140 in the next 3-4 weeks. One can place a stop-loss of Rs 117.

Mahindra Logistics: Buy | LTP: Rs 430 | Stop-Loss: Rs 402 | Target: Rs 475 | Return: 10.4 percent

After a sharp weakness in the past month, the stock price shifted into a broader range movement over the past few weeks. Currently, the stock price is placed at a crucial lower support level of Rs 405.

The formation of a high wave-type weekly candle pattern and the lower shadow of the last three weekly candles signal chances of buying interest emerging from the lows. The weekly 14 period RSI has reached the oversold region and suggests chances of further strengthening of the upside momentum in the stock.

One may look to buy Mahindra Logistics at Rs 430, add more on dips down to Rs 415 and wait for the upside target of Rs 475 in the next 3-4 weeks. One can place a stop-loss of Rs 402.

Ruchit Jain, lead research at 5paisa.com

Inox Leisure: Buy | LTP: Rs 424.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 412 | Target: Rs 460 | 8 percent

The price action in the past few months has led to formation of a ‘Cup and Handle’ pattern on the daily chart. This continuation pattern is formed amid a broader uptrend and hence a breakout from this neckline should lead to resumption of a positive momentum.

A move above Rs 430 will lead to a confirmation and hence, traders should look to buy the stock on breakout.

Traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy the stock above Rs 430 for a potential target of Rs 460 in the near term. One can then place a stop-loss below Rs 412 on long positions.

Astha Jain, senior research analyst at Hem Securities

Maithan Alloys: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,285 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,030 | Target: Rs 1,450-1,600 | Return: 13-25 percent

After making a high of Rs 1,255 in August 2021, the stock fell to Rs 909 in the same month. Also, on the weekly charts, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) rose above its signal line, which qualifies a bullish trend in the stock.

The stock has come out of consolidation with a strong base formation at about the Rs 900 level. We believe the stock is poised for a further upside rally with a medium-term target of Rs 1,450-1,600.

Gufic Biosciences: Buy | LTP: Rs 230.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 190 | Target: Rs 250-270 | Return: 9-17 percent

After making a high of Rs 270 in January 2022, the stock fell and touched Rs 192 in February.

On the weekly charts, the stock has successfully closed above all major moving averages with a Bullish Engulfing pattern formation.

We believe the stock is poised for an upside rally with a medium-term target of Rs 250-270.

Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research (retail) at Kotak Securities

Tata Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,302 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,200 | Target: Rs 1,450-1,500 | Return: 11-15 percent

As per the weekly chart, Tata Steel is set to move higher with a strong bullish reversal formation. The metal sector is also doing well.

A strong recovery after forming several bottoms near Rs 1,050 is showing us that the stock may reach the target of Rs 1,500 in the coming days. Fifty percent should be bought at Rs 1,300 and the rest at Rs 1,225. Stop-loss should be on a closing basis at Rs 1,200.

Jigar S Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers

Wipro: Buy | LTP: Rs 586.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 530 | Target: Rs 640 | Return: 9 percent

Wipro has corrected almost 28 percent in the recent past and was placed well below 200 DMA (day moving average). Having said that, it has formed a Bullish Gartley pattern on the daily chart, with a triple bottom near the PRZ (potential reversal zone) along with a bullish divergence on RSI 14 period. In this scenario, Wipro looks like a lucrative bet.

TCS: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,599.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,450 | Target: Rs 3,950 | Return: 10 percent

TCS has the same setup as Wipro – the only difference is that in TCS, there are Dual Harmonic patterns (Special Gartley and Butterfly) formed with a similar potential reversal zone of Rs 3,500-3,550.

The 14 period daily RSI has shown impulsive behaviour followed by a bullish green candlestick on March 8, which is similar to the Marubozu pattern.

Grasim Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,566.25 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,450 | Target: Rs 1,775 | Return: 13 percent

Grasim has corrected almost 27 percent from a peak of Rs 1,929.80 on January 18 and is currently below its 200 DMA.

At the current juncture, Grasim has respected the potential reversal zone (i.e. Rs 1,500-1,520) of a bullish Butterfly pattern. Multiple Doji candles have formed near the PRZ along with the MACD about to make a positive crossover, which is a sign of an early reversal.

Note to readers: How ​do corporate leaders surf life after hanging up their boots? What do they do next? What are the lessons they learned in their eventful journeys? What advice do they have for the current crop of leaders? Veterans Unpacked is a series of interviews aimed to offer readers lessons from retired bosses on life outside the corner office.

Hailing from Madras (now Chennai), Balasubramanian Muthuraman is a metallurgical engineer who studied at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-Madras) and XLRI Jamshedpur, before he went on to join the Tata Group.

At Tata, he worked across a variety of leadership positions before becoming the managing director of Tata Steel, then India's largest steel player, in 2001, and later its vice-chairman.

While Muthuraman also served on the boards of Tata Industries, it was under his leadership that Tata Steel became a global player with the multi-billion dollar acquisition of steel company Corus (UK, Netherlands) in 2007, and demonstrated the Tata Group's rising presence worldwide.

He was awarded the Padma Bhushan award by the government of India in 2012.

Edited excerpts:

What have you been up to since hanging up your boots/ stepping away from active duty?

I am now involved in other forms of active engagement—more wholesome, more diversified, and in some ways, even more satisfying. I am on three different corporate boards, as well as different management schools and two NGOs as well. The involvement and engagement with all the above gives me a great deal of satisfaction and fulfilment.

What keeps you busy now?

Apart from my formal engagements as detailed above, I have now found new space and time to connect with my IIT-Madras classmates, my batch mates from Tata Steel (with both these groups I have regular virtual calls/ meets), my wonderful grandchildren, play golf, watch some good movies, do a bit of social work, and most of all, spend more quality time with my wife, Sumathi. Forty-eight years of corporate life rarely gave me the opportunity to enjoy these pleasures. I am also privileged to be associated with Sadhguru's Rally for Rivers Movement.

Looking back, can you tell us about three interesting events or anything that has stayed with you since?

Actually, I recall several of them. However, I will narrate three here. In 1966, when I finished from IIT-Madras, I had two offers. One was from Tata Steel, as a graduate trainee with a starting salary of Rs 400 a month; the other was from the University College of Los Angeles for an MS degree in Material Science with a scholarship of USD 400 a month. The decision looked simple to me. I chose the $400 opportunity rather than sweat with the Rs 400 offer. I met my teacher, Professor E.G. Ramachandran, primarily to inform him of my decision to join UCLA and also to thank him since it was he who recommended me to UCLA. Over a two-hour conversation that followed, the professor changed my mind. The things he said, the way he said them, the arguments he put forward, all these convinced me to join Tata Steel. This is the most important conversation of my life and a life-changing one. But for EGR’s sage advice I would have missed working for Tata Steel, one of the finest institutions in the world. This incident and EGR’s persuasive ability will forever remain etched in my memory.

The second was in 1986. I was Marketing Manager (special steels) posted in Jamshedpur. Special steels constituted only 15% of the total production/ sales of Tata Steel. One evening around 7 pm, Russi Mody, our Managing Director, dropped into my office, completely unannounced. What he told me shocked me. He said he was going to send me to Delhi as Regional Manager , a position hierarchically one level below my present position. I was taken aback. I told Mr Mody that my ratings have been consistently excellent for the last several years, and that I will have to resign if I am demoted. I was almost crying. Mody left my room without saying anything more. I was crestfallen. I rang up my wife and told her I have no option but to resign. Within ten minutes, Mody’s executive assistant came into my room and asked me “Did Russi rag you sufficiently?"" He then went on to explain that the top management thought highly of me but there were gaps in my experience and exposure. My posting to Delhi was to be seen in the light of making me fit to handle senior positions rather than as a demotion. I went to Delhi much to the surprise of my colleagues but emerged much better in two years. This incident taught me several dimensions of leadership and was another major turning point in my career.

The third was in 2002. I was making a presentation on Tata Steel’s long-term strategy to the Business Review Committee. My colleagues and I had prepared well, or so I thought. The presentation was seen as a disaster. The disappointment on our chairman’s face was all too clear. We went back to the drawing board. We took major inputs and help from a well-known international consultant. I was sure that this time we would impress the committee. At the end of the presentation, the chairman said “this does not look like your presentation"". Two down. Third time, we really thought it through and came up with what I thought was a brilliant presentation. Surely, this will go through, I thought. At the end, the chairman remarked, “I think we have not entirely wasted our last 3 hours."" I was disappointed and angry. I went back to my room and in a fit of fury, took out the famous Alice in Wonderland cartoon and wrote that “ Mr. Chairman, we are not as rudderless and directionless as Alice, here”. That piece of paper came back to me within 15 minutes with a scribble, “Muthu, if I have managed to serve as the Cheshire Cat during our discussion, I would get a sense of fulfilment."" It opened my eyes and my mind. We went back to the drawing board and restarted the exercise with ‘where do we want to go?' Finally, in our fourth attempt our strategy paper got the chairman’s nod, and I realised the value of methodical strategic thinking.

What do you miss the most about the C suite ?

I don’t really miss much. Maybe the public appreciation. Maybe being in the limelight. But we all know that these are transient. When you are a CEO in a small town like Jamshedpur, people around you make you believe that you are God. If you fall for it, you are finished. Honestly, I don’t miss much. But I must say that I miss Jamshedpur as a place to live. It is outstanding - the best place to live in India.

If you had to relive your corporate career, what would you do differently ?

I think I would do two things differently. One is that I would have managed our acquisitions much better. I now know how, and what we could have done better in this area. Secondly, I would have liked to have been much more digital than I was. This would have helped me as well as the company to be more efficient.

What are the changes in the corporate world that you see now that are vastly different from your time ?

My “time” was as recent as eight years back. In such a short period of time digitalisation has overtaken the world. This is a huge change. I see more entrepreneurial spirit among the current generation than in my times.

Which business leader among the current crop impresses you ?

I would not like to mention names, but Ratan Tata continues to be my benchmark for corporate leadership.

How did you plan for life after retirement?

I did not plan. I had no time to plan for my retired life. In fact, I don’t like the word ‘retirement’. It is not in my dictionary. I have just moved from one phase of life to another phase—one that is even more fulfilling and even more enjoyable than the earlier phase.

Is there anything you would tell your younger self ?

Yes, very much. In fact, many things—take interest in fine arts, music, painting; try and be more Indian, understand India’s rich cultural heritage, learn Sanskrit, don’t forget your mother tongue, Tamil; spend more time with family; don’t become a unidimensional personality.

What is your advice to the next cadre of corporate leaders?

My advice would be the same as what Jamsetji Tata said more than 160 years ago: “The purpose of a business corporation is to improve the quality of life of people all around."" Our society is not merely an integral part of the business, it is the prime reason for the business. “Social welfare, environmental sustainability and the well being of all should be the core of the business, with profits providing the necessary incentive. This philosophy needs to be stressed again and again, in the current day's world.",1526,0.7169160909122891
2022-03-07 14:16:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/man-of-steel-heres-how-tv-narendran-turned-tata-steel-around-8178261.html,"TV Narendran Managing Director of Tata Steel

In 2013, when TV Narendran was named the new managing director of Tata Steel's Indian operations, Cyrus Mistry — then a year into his appointment as chairman of Tata Sons — was trying to shake off the old guard’s grip over the company.

B Muthuraman, who had been managing director back in the aughts and was its vice-chairman in 2013, had turned Tata Steel, a company with a single three-million-tonne plant in Jamshedpur in 2001, into a global steelmaker to be reckoned with. Tata Steel had plants spread across southeast Asia (primarily NatSteel Holdings) and Europe and the UK (the $13 billion Corus acquisition), and miscellaneous other units across the globe.

But Muthuraman was due to retire the following year and his protege HM Nerurkar, Tata Steel’s MD in 2013, was leaving soon as well. Corus had by then morphed from a prestige purchase into a millstone around the neck of whoever came next — billion-dollar impairments of the asset value on its books had just begun.

A balanced leader

In 2013, Narendran was 48 years old.

“He doesn’t have a flamboyant personality; he’s specific and balanced in what he says,” a former industry counterpart of Narendran told Moneycontrol.

He went on to explain how his style of working is very different from his predecessor Muthuraman, “He (Narendran) was quite diligent in establishing good relationships with senior members of his teams.”

“Naren had to take the bull by the horns on Corus right after he was appointed. And while he was doing that, global metal prices crashed. With the turnaround in Tata Steel, he has let his work speak, instead of seeking the limelight for himself,” he added.

In 2017, Narendran was elevated to global CEO and, according to some news reports, may also be elevated to a board seat at Tata Sons.

Remarkable turnaround

There’s good reason for this. Under Narendran, Tata Steel has come a long way from its 2013 avatar, when it seemed to be in danger of sinking under the weight of its ambitions. Today, its nine-month reported profit for FY22 is Rs 31,914 crore, edging out the group’s reigning cash cow, Tata Consultancy Services. In the previous fiscal year, Tata Steel had reported its highest-ever operating profit. Today, its global capacity stands at over 32 million tonnes of steel per annum.

Surging metal prices and cheap iron ore from captive mines have kept profits stable in India while Tata Steel Europe, a trimmed and downsized version of the old Corus, is generating enough positive cash flow to not be a drain on its parent anymore. On February 11, The Times of India reported speculation that Narendran might soon be elevated to the board of Tata Sons.

“I’ve always found Narendran polite and attentive, and always very responsive. Since taking over as CEO and interacting with various national and international organisations, he has grown and blossomed into a person with a pleasing, quiet confidence,” OP Bhatt, former chairman of State Bank of India, and now an independent director on Tata Steel’s board, told Moneycontrol. “Under his leadership the Tata Steel Group is at an all-time high,” he said.

Bhatt was interim chairman at Tata Steel in the period between Mistry’s dramatic ouster and the current chairman N Chandransekaran’s appointment.

“An important thing about his leadership is his concern for people; whether it’s preventing accidents and loss of life or when there is recruitment, promotions or downsizing,” Bhatt added. “The downsizing he had to implement in the Netherlands and the UK was fair and responsible. Tata Steel wasn’t stingy with time or with money. It lived the Tata values. In the UK, he enabled a £2 billion fix for the deficit in pensions by negotiating a deal the unions supported. This is conscious capitalism in practice,” Bhatt said.

Playing hardball when required

One of the few times that Narendran made a business disagreement public was in the summer of 2020, when he abruptly stepped down as president of the Indian Steel Association (ISA), months shy of his two-year term’s expiry. The ISA is a trade body that represents the interests of the country’s largest primarily steel producers — SAIL, RINL, JSW, JSPL, Tata Steel and AM/NS India — to the Union and State governments on common prices and policies. Tata Steel disputed proposed changes to the mining policy, which put older firms with captive iron ore mines on long leases at a disadvantage.

“After Dilip Oommen (CEO of AM/NS India) took over as president of ISA, he and I smoothed things over and created an atmosphere where the parties could be reconciled,” said Bhaskar Chatterjee, former chief executive officer of ISA. “As an association we wanted to present a united front. We respected the fact that whereas business decisions would be competitive in nature, as members of ISA we needed to reconcile our differences and work on a common agenda and platform.""

In cyclical commodity businesses such as steel, accessing cheap funds and maintaining enough elbow room to survive the inevitable downturn is as important as keeping the blast furnaces running. At Tata Steel, this falls on Koushik Chatterjee.

Back in 2013, the two caught the media’s attention in the race for CEO. Chatterjee, in fact, had been rumoured to be ahead in the shortlist, till Mistry’s surprise announcement of Narendran.

“Naren and Koushik have been working together for a long time,” Bhatt said, about the two at the helm of Tata Steel. “Their relationship is even stronger after both interviewed for the roles of CEO. Their roles are clearly defined and have a lot of synergy. Naren travels to plants in Jamshedpur, Kalingangar and overseas while Koushik not only is the key finance person but also provides the anchor role.”

The duo have made two serious attempts to find a solution to the remaining European plants — Port Talbot in the UK and Ijmuiden steelworks in the Netherlands. First, a merger with Germany’s thyssenkrupp fell through, as did a later sale of only the Ijmuiden plant to Swedish steelmaker SSAB AB.

Acquisition spree in India

While they continue to right operations overseas, both Narendran and Chatterjee have doubled down on acquisitions in India.

In 2018, Tata Steel bought Bhushan Steel through the bankruptcy process for Rs 35,200 crore and folded it within the company as Tata Steel BSL.

In 2019, a subsidiary, Tata Sponge Iron, bought another bankrupt firm, Usha Martin, one of the largest wire rope manufacturers globally, for over Rs 4,500 crore.

This January, another subsidiary, Tata Steel Long Products, agreed to buy a 93.71 percent stake in state-owned Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL) for Rs 12,100 crore.

Stock analysts have called the price of these acquisitions into question, especially in the case of NINL, which comes at an acquisition cost of nearly $1,700 per tonne of steel against a replacement cost calculated to be half as much. Tata Steel argues that NINL gives it access to cheap captive iron ore and land banks for expansion near its existing Kalinganagar plant. It will also have synergies with infrastructure already built in the area, all contributing towards the company’s goal to build over 40 million tonnes of steelmaking capacity in India by 2030.

“Under Narendran and Chatterjee, Tata Steel has maintained focus on debt reduction even as they make pricey acquisitions. Their capital expenditure at Kalinganagar and Jamshedpur has remained low-intensity as well,” Amit Dixit, Director, Institutional Equities, Edelweiss Securities, said. “When steel prices fall next, which they will in the coming months, Tata Steel is better positioned to maintain operational profitability compared to its peers and we’re likely to see the return on equity increase.”

It is not, however, sufficient anymore for businesses to simply grow. The younger generation of consumers and investors is demanding climate accountability, and decarbonisation of fossil fuel-drenched industries like metal making. Tata Steel’s next test of leadership will be in ensuring emission-neutral growth, in tune with the conscious capitalism of the coming decades.",1331,0.34438131749629974

The crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after weeks of geopolitical tensions is slowly but surely engulfing every corner of the world economy, either directly or indirectly.

The two countries are among the world’s biggest producers of commodities, especially oil, gas, and metals, both base metals and specialty metals. Food commodity prices have also increasing as a result of the conflict, which has dented imports of finished goods from other parts of the world by Russia and Ukraine.

Given that Russia is one of the world’s largest producers and suppliers of oil and gas, the impact of the crisis was immediately visible in the swift rise of crude prices, which are trading beyond $100 per barrel for the first time since the highs of 2014. In 2011-14, oil prices were elevated and averaged $110/bbl.

“Apart from geopolitical tensions, China’s investment cycle remained relatively strong until mid-2014, adding to the demand pressures on industrial commodity prices,” Morgan Stanley wrote in a note. “During this period, Asia’s commodity trade deficits were at their widest, averaging 4.9% of GDP, driven by its energy trade deficit.”

This time around, oil prices have spiked although they remain 27% lower than in 2014 in real terms. As Russia and Ukraine are major producers of agricultural products such as wheat, barley and maize, and Russia is also a key producer of metals, these commodity prices are reacting too.

“So far, commodity prices have already gotten a boost from trailing strong global demand and the effects of the energy transition and slower investment in commodity sectors” the Morgan Stanley report added.

Russia’s share in commodities markets

Russia is a leading player in commodities markets ranging from coal to precious metals. At the global level, 35 percent of palladium and 10 percent of platinum is produced by Russia. Russian aluminium giant Rusal accounts for 6 percent of global aluminium supplies and Norsk Nickel meets over 5 percent of global demand for nickel.

Russia is also one of the largest exporters of coal. It accounted for about 18 percent of global thermal coal exports and over 10 percent of coking coal over the last four years. Its steel exports accounted for 6.5 percent of global sea-borne steel exports.

Impact on metals

“In our view, the sanctions on Russia would likely flare up commodity prices – already facing the heat of supply disruption during Covid-19,” Edelweiss Equity Research wrote in a report.

For instance, global thermal coal export volumes in calendar year 2021 were estimated at 992 MMT (Million Metric Tonnes) which was about 10 percent lower compared to 2018-19. So a disruption in Russian supply can be meaningful for global coal prices.

The ongoing conflict has Russian potential implications for non-ferrous metals and energy prices as supply of steel, copper, aluminium, and precious metals feel the impact; higher energy and carbon costs, particularly in Europe, will push the global cost structure higher.

“Base metals have been on a roll for much of 2021, and 2022 got further impetus from Chinese power-led shutdowns and changing monetary policies globally,” said Navneet Damani, senior vice president of commodity and currency research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Aluminum gained over 40 percent in 2021 and has added ~20 percent in 2022. It currently trades at $3,300 per ton in the international market. Sanctions on Russian aluminium maker Rusal in 2018 drove the metal's price up 35 percent in a matter of days.

Used in stainless steel and batteries for electric vehicles, nickel is up around 20 percent this year, having risen 25 percent in 2021.

“Lower inventories in metals along with strong consistent demand had been already supporting the backdrop, and with the latest trigger, it looks like the metal has got some more feet to rally,” Damani added.

The geo-political crisis has resulted in a flare up in commodity/metal prices and with the supply from two of the world’s largest exporters of metals getting stalled, Indian companies have got the opportunities in the export markets. This has resulted in a run-up in the prices of metal stocks, which have appreciated 10 to 50 percent.

Jindal Steel & Power has generated the highest returns of 49.47 percent so far in this year. Its captive coal has put in a good stead compared to the competition.

NMDC, Vedanta, Tata Steel and Hindalco are other stocks that have appreciated more than 20 percent during this calendar year.

Impact on food commodities

Both Ukraine and Russia contribute significantly to the global supply of food grains, especially wheat and corn.

Data from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) shows that Russia and Ukraine together supplied around 56 MMT of wheat in 2020-21, which equates to around 27.6 percent of global exports.

The data also suggests that both countries also exported around 27.9 MMT of corn in 2020-21, which accounted for 15.4 percent of global exports.

Any disruption in food grain exports from Russia and Ukraine will increase the prices of essential food commodities like wheat and corn.

Likely beneficiaries

Edelweiss Equity Research is of the view that the ongoing conflict has the potential to aid both prices and volumes as domestic steel players are likely to get an unfettered exports market in Southeast Asia where Russia has emerged as the regional price setter.

Edelweiss added: “If Russian exports are curtailed, coupled with the ongoing maintenance activities at Far East Mills and China focusing on reducing steel exports, we are likely to see benefits for Indian steel mills such as JSW Steel and Tata Steel gaining in the export market. ii) Uptick in LME Aluminium prices will aid Hindalco the most, as its integration would limit the cost increase. iii) Jindal Stainless will likely gain from higher nickel prices.”

That said, an uptick in coking coal price might impact the costs of steelmakers although Tata Steel and JSPL may be at a relative advantage.

Global investors focusing on environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of companies, even attaching a premium to it, will make it increasingly important for the group to expedite its plans as it needs access to global funds across businesses to reduce debt and finance growth.

Closer home, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has committed to a five-point climate action plan, the so-called “Panchamrit”, at the core of which is the ambition to be a net zero emissions country by 2070. Tata Sons, which is already working towards sustainability and clean energy, will have to work more aggressively to align itself to the plan.

For a group that traditionally used conventional energy to fuel its energy-guzzling businesses, Tata Sons has a stated sustainability policy that looks at creating long-term stakeholder value by integrating economic, environmental and social considerations for all Tata companies. The group set up the Tata Sustainability Group in 2014 which partners with all the Tata companies to embed sustainability in their business strategies. Group executives said that Chandrasekaran is likely to use this platform to push the group to improve its ESG ratings.

Experts tracking the group believe it will work on a two-pronged strategy—focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy while generating and sourcing electricity, and reduction of carbon emissions across businesses.

New Energy

Before 2022 began, Chandrasekaran addressed Tata Sons employees in a letter that was seen to be setting the tone for the group’s road ahead. He said in the letter to colleagues that new energy will be a key premise for the group. “Our strategy, looking ahead, has four themes: digital, new energy, supply chain resilience, and health. Our companies are already adapting to these changes, and we are witnessing a stronger performance,” he said in the letter.

In line with this strategy, the group’s power utility, Tata Power Company, is focusing on its green energy arm Tata Power Renewables to grow it fivefold in five years across businesses. It aims to scale up capacity to 15 GW by 2025 from about 3 GW now. Tata Power has a strategic goal of phasing out its coal-based power and scale up clean energy that makes up around 30 percent of total generation now to 80 percent by 2030. The group is keen to unlock value in the renewable business.

In an interview to Moneycontrol last month, Tata Power Renewables president Ashish Khanna said, “We have not changed a lot of portfolios; we have just been going on with aggressive growth in the segment we were serving in the past.”

The company’s push on renewables is in line with India’s ambitious target to have half of its energy mix from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. At COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow, Modi increased the target India has set for renewable energy capacity to 500 GW; it is around 150 GW now.

The new “aggression” in energy transition is apparent and will be a continued theme in Chandrasekaran’s second term at the helm, as the next five years would be crucial to achieve these milestones.

With a focus on sustainable and clean energy development, Tata Power is also steering the transformation as an integrated solutions provider by looking at new business growth in distributed generation through rooftop solar and micro grids, storage solutions, electric vehicles charging infrastructure and home automation, among other initiatives.

Group companies like Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) have also taken steps to source more energy from cleaner sources. Tata Motors is a signatory to the RE100 initiative of The Climate Group, under which it has committed to using 100 percent renewable energy by 2030.

Chasing ESG Goals

In early 2021, Tata Sons had reportedly sent a directive to the top management of all group companies to work on a priority basis towards formulating a framework that would help each one of them to meet ESG norms. While parts of this plan are already evident, Chandrasekaran is likely to consolidate a plan for the entire group, sources within the group have indicated.

India’s aim to be at net zero emission by 2070 means that the share of electric cars and the contribution of biofuels for heavier vehicles will have to increase to 84 percent, and industries will have to transition to cleaner biofuels or hydrogen. While the group’s new pilots and businesses, from 5G to TataNeu and Tata Electronics, are being built around the ESG theme, existing businesses are moving swiftly to adapt it.

TCS has plans to be a net zero emission company by 2030 and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70 percent till 2025. As a global technology giant, this will be important for the company as not just investors but even customers are closely watching its performance on these parameters.

Tata Steel is working towards making the production process more sustainable, and making CO2-neutral steel with hydrogen.

Tata Chemicals has committed to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to reduce CO2 emissions. The company is building its first industrial-scale carbon capture unit in the UK.

Tata Sons’ Sustainability Working Council said in a meeting in December after the COP26 meeting that India’s projected carbon emissions by 2030 will be 4.48 billion tonnes, almost double its present emissions. This would mean a 22 percent reduction in carbon emissions from the business-as-usual scenario will be required if the country wants to achieve its goal of cutting projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes.

Chandrasekaran has led the group from the pledge to plan stages for these milestones. Now he faces the task of executing these plans.",978,0.880036065975825

The market capitalisation of Tata Group companies has nearly tripled during the first tenure of N Chandrasekaran as the Chairman of Tata Sons.

The Group on February 11 extended the term of Chandrasekaran as the Chairman of the multi-billion dollar conglomerate five years after he was first appointed.

The total market capitalisation of the listed entities of the group has risen by 183 percent in the five-year period starting February 2017 to Rs 23.8 lakh crore, making it the highest valued Indian conglomerate, data from AceEquity showed. In the same period, the Nifty 50 index has risen 97 percent.

In the five-year period prior to Chandrasekaran's appointment, the market capitalisation of listed Tata Group companies had risen 100 percent to nearly Rs 8 lakh crore.

The biggest gainers in terms of market capitalisation during the five-year period were Tata Teleservices, Tata Elxsi, Tata Consumer Products, Titan Company, Tata Steel, and Tata Consultancy Services.

Tata Elxsi’s market capitalisation surged 976 percent in the five-year period to Rs 47,352 crore. TCS, which accounts for 58 percent of the Group’s market value, saw its market capitalisation rise by 200 percent in the same period to Rs 13.95 lakh crore.

Much of the upswing in the fortune of the Group can be traced back to the ongoing bull market in the Indian equity market since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Further, the rise in global commodity markets since the beginning of the pandemic owing to a supply crunch and depleting inventories has brought investors back to many of the 'old economy' stocks that are part of the Group, analysts said.

Tata Steel, for example, has seen its market capitalisation swell by 286 percent to Rs 1.52 lakh crore under Chandrasekaran’s tenure with the majority of those gains coming during the pandemic period as the company benefitted from a rise in global steel prices.

Among the disappointment of Chandrasekaran's tenure has been the performance of Tata Motors. Shares of Tata Motors have risen merely 20 percent in his first term as chairman reflecting the ongoing concerns over the company’s subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover. That said, Tata Motors' stock has risen substantially in the past 18 months after the company announced plans to go net debt-free in the coming years.

Only two stocks gave negative returns in Chandrasekaran’s reign, these were the differentiated voting rights of Tata Motors which fell 20 percent, and TRF, which fell 36 percent.",413,0.3632294876234872

The market gained for the first time in the last four straight sessions, though there was volatility, and closed third of a percent higher on Tuesday, backed by buying in metal, pharma, auto, banking and financial stocks.

The BSE Sensex climbed 187 points to close above 57,800 and the Nifty50 jumped more than 50 points to settle the session above 17,260. However, there was a selling pressure in the broader markets as the Nifty Midcap 100 index fell 0.7 percent and Smallcap 100 index declined 1.7 percent.

Stocks that were in focus include Tata Steel which was the biggest gainer in the Nifty50, rising 3.09 percent to Rs 1,219.60, and SRF which was the third biggest gainer in the futures & options segment, climbing 3.28 percent to Rs 2,531.30.

Birla Cable was also in action, which gained 17.34 percent to close at Rs 118.75 and Skipper which rose 9.85 percent to Rs 79.20.

Here's what Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

SRF

This counter seems to be in a corrective and consolidation process after hitting new lifetime highs of Rs 2,680 in January. Considering the strong move of the last trading session, it can be presumed that this counter is positioning itself to test its life highs of Rs 2,680 and can break into uncharted territories as well.

Therefore, there can be a trading opportunity and one can buy it with a stop-loss below Rs 2,429 and look for an initial target of Rs 2,680 levels.

Birla Cable

Strong price appreciation on the back of huge volumes is hinting that this counter is positioning itself for a fresh breakout which will be confirmed at a close above Rs 123 levels. In that scenario, much bigger upsides cannot be ruled out but the initial target will remain around Rs 151 levels.

Therefore, positional traders are advised to adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and on dips into the zone of Rs 109 to Rs 106 levels but stop-loss for this trade will remain below Rs 98.

Skipper

This counter seems to have registered a fresh breakout from the 29-week downsloping channel. Price surge of the last session on the back of relatively higher volumes can be pointing at the beginning of the new leg of rally.

However, initial hurdles can be placed in the zone of Rs 84–88 and once the supplies present in this zone are absorbed then it should head higher to test its lifetime highs. Dips can be an attractive option to buy into this counter with a stop-loss below Rs 70.

Tata Steel

This counter appears to be in a counter-trend rally as the medium-term trend looks down with lower tops and lower lows since August 2021.

The current pullback move is likely to face critical resistance from the down sloping trend line which it needs to clear with a close above Rs 1,250 which should confirm a breakout in this counter paving the way for a bigger and sustainable upswing.

For time being, we advise traders to book profits around Rs 1,240 and wait for a breakout.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Steel

TATA steel (TATA) reported Q3FY22 EBITDA in line with our estimates at Rs158.9bn (down 3.4% QoQ). While it came above consensus estimates (CE) by 4%. India operation’s EBITDA came above our estimates by 5% while Tata steel Europe (TSE) missed our expectation by 20% due to higher energy cost. Recent relaxation of monetary policy for real-estate sector and front loading of infrastructure spending reflects visible pressure on Chinese authorities to stimulate economic activity after registering meaningful slowdown over last two quarters. While, concerns on oversupply resulting from contraction in demand were addressed by commensurate curbs on production. Unlike past, this limited the intensity of Chinese mills to dump steel in exports markets. In the midst of low competitive intensity of Chinese mills and improving visibility on demand, abnormal surge in coking coal prices by ~27% in a month to All-time high level of US$445/t will be a pressure point for earnings of steel companies in next couple of quarters. Notwithstanding that, margins of Indian steel mills are significantly better than historical levels on back of strong steel prices.

Outlook

Underpinned by solid B/S, sound earnings outlook (with FY23e margins lower by 33% over Q3FY22) and attractive valuations, we reiterate BUY with TP of Rs1,745 (earlier Rs1,842), EV/EBITDA of 5.7x FY23e.

Moody’s Investors Service on Monday said the acquisition of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL) by Tata Steel arm is credit positive because it will increase the subsidiary’s long-steel production capacity and its reserves of iron ore.

Last month, Tata Steel had announced winning the bid for acquiring 93.71 per cent stake in Odisha-based NINL for Rs 12,100 crore.

""On January 31, Tata Steel Ltd (TSL, Ba1 stable) announced that its 74 per cent-owned subsidiary Tata Steel Long Products Ltd (TSLP) will acquire a 93.7 per cent stake in Neelachal Ispat Nigam…The acquisition will give TSL access to NINL’s 1.1 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of long-steel producing capacity, 100 million tonnes of iron ore reserves and 2,500 acres of land,” Moody’s Investors Service said in a statement.

Still, NINL is loss-making and Moody’s Investors Service said that it believes that the acquisition price largely reflects the steel plant, iron ore reserves and the land acreage that can accommodate capacity expansions.

And, while the acquired operations are substantially smaller than TSL’s current global capacity of 32.5 MTPA, including its 19.6 MTPA capacity in India, it is credit positive because it will increase TSL’s long-steel product capacity and increase its reserves of iron ore.

TSL expects to fund the acquisition through a combination of internal accruals and debt.

""Even assuming the USD 1.6 billion enterprise value is paid entirely through debt, we estimate TSL’s proforma leverage at September 2021 would climb to 1.8x. To the extent the acquisition is funded through internal accruals, the peak pro forma leverage would be less than 1.8x. Even so, with a rating downgrade leverage threshold around 3.5x, there is a sufficient buffer in TSL’s financial metrics to accommodate the proposed acquisition,” the statement said.

Since March 2020, TSL has reduced its adjusted gross consolidated debt including interest bearing customer advances, which we treat as debt by around 30 per cent.",316,1.0

Here's what global brokerages have to say about Tata Steel after its Q3 numbers:

CLSA

The global brokerage firm has a “buy” call on the stock with the target at Rs 1,820 a share. It is of the view that Q3 EBITDA was largely in line, adding that India profitability surprised positively. However, the Europe profitability was impacted by higher energy costs.

JP Morgan

The global research firm has an “overweight” call on the stock with the target at Rs 1,850 a share.

""Q3 was a beat with strong underlying quarter and with large net debt reduction. India standalone now reflects both India and BSL. Tata Europe has flat volumes, higher energy cost and repair costs. Market appears to be expecting a sharp steel price correction, with steel prices continuing to move higher,"" it added.

Investec

The research firm has a buy call with the target at Rs 2,000 a share. The firm believes that the steel-maker's performance was in-line, while capital allocation on the Europe business is to be watched.

""Tata Steel expects Indian steel prices to remain resilient, while European prices should remain steady,"" it said.

Dutch prosecutors announced Wednesday they are launching a criminal investigation into Tata Steel Ijmuiden over alleged pollution from its huge steel works near the Dutch North Sea coast.

Prosecutors said that their investigation was into alleged intentional and unlawful introduction of hazardous substances into the soil, air or surface water.

The probe also targets Harsco Metals Holland, a company that also operates at the Tata Steel plant in the small village of Ijmuiden. Prosecutors will investigate the two companies and the roles of their leadership.

The announcement comes after a lawyer last year submitted complaints to prosecutors from some 800 people who live near the steel factory.

In September last year, an investigation by the Dutch Public Health and Environment Institute found elevated levels of lead and other deposits in dust falling in residential areas near Tata Steel's Ijmuiden plant.

Exposure to the amounts of lead and PAH in the dust in the IJmond (region) is undesirable for the health of children, the institute said in a statement referring to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAH.

In a written reaction to the prosecutors' announcement, Tata Steel pledged to cooperate with the investigation and said it is looking forward to the results of the investigation with confidence.

Residents near the Tata Steel plant have long voiced health concerns about dust produced by the production.

Last year, the company said it would accelerate a package of measures aimed at slashing emissions from its Ijmuiden site.

Steel making in the village of Ijmuiden dates back to 1918. The plant was acquired in 2007 by Tata Steel, one of Europes biggest steel producers.",270,-0.9904711842536926

The benchmark indices clocked more than 1 percent gains for the second straight session on Tuesday on the back of a growth-oriented Union Budget presented by the finance minister while positive global cues lifted market sentiment. All sectors, barring auto and PSU banks, participated in the rally.

The BSE Sensex rallied nearly 850 points to close above 58,850, and the Nifty50 jumped nearly 240 points to close over 17,570 levels, while the broader markets also gained strength as the Nifty Midcap 100 index was up 1.12 percent and the Nifty Smallcap 100 index rose 0.57 percent.

Stocks that were in focus include Tata Steel and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries which were top gainers in the Nifty50, rising 7.54 percent to close at Rs 1,167.35, and 6.86 percent to Rs 891.75.

Among others, Navin Fluorine International was the biggest gainer in the futures and options segment, surging 8.2 percent to Rs 4,256.80 and Hatsun Agro Products rallied 14.06 percent to Rs 1,165.70.

Here's what Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Sun Pharma

The way this counter rallied in the last five sessions, from the lows of Rs 784 to a high of Rs 895, hints that it is on a strong medium-term uptrend. Moreover, for the last 51 weeks, this counter seems to be moving in a well-defined ascending channel with multiple touchpoints.

Hence, sustaining above Rs 840 levels, it can eventually head towards the upper boundary of the said channel. Therefore, positional traders can continue to hold with a stop-loss below Rs 839 on a closing basis and look for a target placed around Rs 970. Even fresh buying can be considered on dips.

Navin Fluorine International

Albeit this counter sharply rallied, in the last session, on the back of huge volumes the medium-term trend still appears to be sideways as it is moving in the larger trading range of Rs 4,300 – Rs 3,300 levels.

Hence, this counter needs a sustainable breakout above Rs 4,320 levels with new lifetime highs. In that scenario, strength can be expected to expand towards Rs 4,900 levels.

For the time being, considering huge volumes, positional traders can buy dips close to Rs 4,000, in anticipation of a breakout with a stop below Rs 3,900 levels.

Tata Steel

Medium-term trend in this counter seems to be down as it is on a corrective downswing from the highs of Rs 1,534 levels registered in August 2021. However, with double bottom formation around Rs 1,060 levels and a sharp recovery from the said support is pointing towards a tradable opportunity.

Hence, sustaining above Rs 1,080 levels a target of Rs 1,245 can be expected. While positional traders are expected to hold fresh buying should be considered on dips but with a stop-loss below Rs 1,080 levels.

Hatsun Agro Products

Strong recovery, from the intraday low of Rs 1,022, after retracing almost 80 percent of the last leg of the rally from the low of Rs 915 to a lifetime high of Rs 1,526, can be suggesting that this counter seems to have embarked on a pullback rally.

Sustaining above Rs 1,022 levels, eventually, it can head towards Rs 1,390 levels. Therefore, dips into the zone of Rs 1,110 – 1,070 can be a good opportunity to create fresh long positions.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel Long Products (TSLP) has acquired the government’s 93.71% stake in Neelachal Ispat Nigam (NINL) for INR121b. The deal implies an EV of INR129b (at 100% stake) for the 100mt iron ore mine and the land parcel of 2,500 acres. As the NINL plant is a short distance away from Tata Steel’s Kalinganagar plant, the two plants will have a certain level of operational synergies. The plan going forward: The management plans to set up a greenfield long steel products plant of 4.5mt capacity on NINL’s land. This implies that the existing inefficient 1mt mini blast furnace (MBF) and ancillary equipment is likely to be taken out to make way for the new plant.

Outlook

We cut our consolidated FY22E/FY23E EBITDA estimate by 10.8%/7.3%, raise our net debt assumption to factor in: a) the current acquisition and b) slowdown in steel cycle, with rising coking coal costs. We value Tata Steel on a SoTP basis at INR1,235 (from INR1,565 earlier). Key risk to our forecast is a slowdown in China.

The Nifty managed to close above 18,000 psychological mark for the third straight session and formed a Doji candle on daily charts. However, it is important to note that in the recent up move, the index has been forming small bodied candles indicating loss of momentum.

The RSI (relative strength index) indicator on lower timeframes is showing price momentum divergence.

The Nifty has resistance in the 18,270-18,330 zone whereas the support lies at 17,900 mark.

The index looks over-stretched and could possibly be rangebound and witness a pullback towards 17,900-17,950 levels. On the flip side, if index manages to cross 18,330 then it can move higher towards the life time high of 18,600.

Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

Tata Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,221.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,150 | Target: Rs 1,480 | Return: 21 percent

Tata Steel has been moving lower in a corrective phase ever since it tested a high of Rs 1,534 in the month of August 2021. The stock seems to have halted its down move and entered a consolidation after finding support near the Rs 1,065 which is placed close to the 38.2 percent retracement level of the up move from Rs 250-Rs 1,534.

On January 13, 2022 the prices gained momentum and managed to break above the 8-week high, with above average volume.

The RSI plotted on the weekly chart can be seen moving higher after forming a bullish hinge near the 40 mark, indicating increasing bullish momentum in the prices.

Going ahead we expect the prices to move higher towards Rs 1,370 mark immediately followed by Rs 1,480. We recommend a strict stop-loss of Rs 1,150 on daily closing basis.

Tata Chemicals: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,014.05 | Stop-Loss: Rs 955 | Target: Rs 1,158 | Return: 14 percent

Tata Chemicals had been moving in a range between Rs 955-825 for the past 10 weeks. On January 13, the prices gained momentum and managed to move above the 10-week high, with good volume build-up, indicating participation in the up move.

The RSI plotted on the weekly chart managed to sustain above the 50 mark through the correction and is currently moving higher towards the overbought level, indicating increasing bullish momentum as the prices move higher.

Going ahead we expect the prices to move higher towards the Rs 1,158 mark. If the prices manage to breach and sustain above the Rs 1,158 level, we might see further up move towards the Rs 1,266 and Rs 1,370 mark eventually.

We recommend a strict stop-loss of Rs 955 on daily closing basis.

Sequent Scientific: Buy | LTP: Rs 189.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 175 | Target: Rs 225 | Return: 18 percent

Sequent Scientific has recently broken out of the falling trendline along with the 50-Day moving average resistance with strong volumes.

The stock has broken above the previous swing high of Rs 185 and negated the lower high lower low formation.

The RSI indicator is confirming the breakout and moving higher indicating strong momentum.

Looking at the prices action and the momentum indicators we believe this stock is a perfect bottom fishing candidate.

One can look to buy Sequent Scientific with a target of Rs 225 and maintain a stop-loss of Rs 175 on Daily closing basis.

(Image credit: Photo Instagrammed by Ratan Tata)

Ratan Tata, iconic industrialist, turns 84 today. The chairman emeritus of Tata Sons is among the top trends on the internet, with people from all walks of life sending him their wishes.

Last year, Tata had recalled his first visit to Jamshedpur, the city in Jharkhand set up by Jamshedji Nusserwanji Tata. Ratan Tata was on a holiday from college when he visited the steel city.

“I remember the first time I ever visited Jamshedpur, when I was on holiday from college. Mr. R. G. Da Costa and Mr. J. D. Chokshi invited me to visit the Telco plant and have a walk around the plant. This trip was much before I started working on the Tata Steel floor, my first interaction with the legacy city of Jamshedpur,” Rata Tata had written on Instagram in July 2020.

In an accompanying photo, a young Tata is seen at the steel plant.



He returned to India after his college in 1962 and moved to Jamshedpur which was then in Bihar, on his first assignment with the group. The company was Tata Steel (then known as Tisco) and Tata spent six years on the shop floor, first in the engineering division and finally in the projects division as technical assistant to the director-in-charge.

The present-day Jamshedpur, which was earlier known as Sakchi, was created with the setting up of the Tata Steel Plant.

Waking up five minutes before a morning meeting, running errands while answering a call or attending meetings in your PJs - it is safe to say that this has probably been most people's work-life since the coronavirus pandemic hit us.

Along with masks and sanitisers, working from home became a lifestyle change professionals adapted to. While the benefits of WFH are debatable and subjective to each profession, a lot of companies in the last two years have realised a few perks and advantages of it.

Employees have vouched for the flexibility, increase in productivity and decrease in travel time that WFH brings. Hence, if you are someone who loves the idea of working from home, here are seven companies that switched to permanent work from home.

Slack

An application that has made work from home seamless for so many organisations, Slack is a software platform that helps professionals working in a company to communicate hassle-free.

The California-based enterprise quickly shifted its workforce to work from home as soon as the pandemic broke out and then decided to make it a permanent way of work. Furthermore, Slack is also increasingly hiring remote-first employees. Some of its recent remote job openings are for the role of product managers.

Twitter

Just like Slack, Twitter took the decision to shift to work from home very early on in the pandemic. The social media platform announced that work from home will be a permanent affair, except for those who need to be present physically at the office because their work entails them to do so. Employees can go to the office whenever they deem fit.

Former CEO Jack Dorsey anyway voiced plans of a 'distributed workforce' even before the COVID-19 outbreak. He said that Twitter was looking to hire for remote positions outside San Francisco, where the company is headquartered. Some of the recent remote job openings are Senior – Staff Researcher – Creator Experience and Conversation Lead.

Spotify

Sweden-based music streaming platform Spotify confirmed in February, that it had decided on a work from anywhere policy for its employees.

According to this policy, Spotify employees can work from home or office, wherever they want, even after the pandemic ends. However, the decision should be a unanimous one, which will be decided between the employees and their managers.

Furthermore, the employees can even work outside of their city or country too, even at places where there are no Spotify offices. Moreover, they can also obtain membership of Spotify co-working spaces, which they have set up in all those areas where they do not have any offices.

Tata Steel

India's premier steel manufacturing company, Tata Steel, jumped on the work from home bandwagon as well. Tata Steel's work from home policy called the 'Agile Working Model' allows employees to opt for WFH for up to 365 days a year. Furthermore, even the officers who were required to be based out of a particular location can choose to WFH for an unlimited number of days per year.

The organisation has always been cognizant of its employees' needs. During the peak of the second COVID wave in 2021, when many people lost their lives, Tata Steel announced that it would continue to pay the monthly salary to the family of all employees who died due to COVID-19. Along with the salary, the company would also provide medical benefits and residential facilities, it said.

Meta

Formerly known as Facebook, Meta - early on in the pandemic - announced work from home for its workforce. Now, the company has rolled out its 'office deferral program' which will ensure that its employees have flexibility in returning back to offices.

In December, even though the social media tech company announced that it would fully reopen its US offices on January 31, 2022, it reaffirmed that it would also stick to its earlier plans of offering full-time remote work to employees who can work remotely and request for the same.

""We recognise that some employees aren’t quite ready to come back. We continue to offer a variety of options to choose what works best for them, so our employees can make informed decisions about where they work,"" said Janelle Gale, vice president, human resources of the company.

Microsoft

Microsoft, in the pandemic, made an entire hybrid work manual that would allow its employees to work from home freely for less than 50 percent of their working week, and managers would be able to approve permanent remote work.

""We will offer as much flexibility as possible to support individual work styles, while balancing business needs, and ensuring we live our culture,"" Kathleen Hogan, Microsoft's chief people officer, said in a post on the official Microsoft Blog.

""To address this, we have provided guidance to employees to make informed decisions around scenarios that could include changes to their worksite, work location, and/or work hours once offices are open without any COVID-19 restrictions.""

Employees can move across the country for remote work, but compensation and benefits will vary depending on the company's own geopay scale. Those who move will need to cover their own relocation expenses. Microsoft will cover home office expenses for permanent remote workers.

Flexible working hours will be available without manager approval, the company stressed, adding that some roles still require access to Microsoft offices, hardware, data centres and in-person training.

Shopify

Breaking the glass ceiling, Tata Steel on Thursday onboarded 14 transgenders as Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) operators at its West Bokaro division in Jharkhand’s Ramgarh district.

The move comes close on the heels of the private sector steel manufacturer’s announcement that its Noamundi Iron Mine in the state is set to witness a 30-member all-women team taking up drilling, dumper, and shovel operations in all shifts from early next year.

The company has set a target of creating a 25 per cent diverse workforce by 2025.

""As part of its sustained efforts to enable a diverse and inclusive culture, Tata Steel’s West Bokaro division today onboarded 14 transgenders as Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) operators at its coal mines. This landmark initiative aims to break the glass ceiling but also targets to mainstream transgenders in society,” the company said in a statement.

Speaking on the occasion, Tata Steel vice president, raw materials, D B Sundara Ramam, said as an equal opportunity employer, Tata Steel respects the uniqueness of individuals and is “putting its best foot forward to shape the workspace of tomorrow.

“This day marks yet another milestone in our journey towards a diverse and inclusive tomorrow. Our pioneering diversity and inclusion endeavours are transformative and have brought about paradigm shifts in the way we do mining.""

Congratulating the team, the company’s vice president, human resources management, Atrayee Sanyal, said pioneering initiatives like this further reinforce the company's belief in strengthening the organisation through embracing a variety of identities, thoughts, and perspectives.

“We will continue with our efforts to drive LGBTQ inclusion and build a benchmark workplace. We welcome all the members to the Tata Steel family and wish them all success and a great career ahead,"" said Sanyal.

LGBTQ refers to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, and related communities.

Recently, Tata Steel’s West Bokaro division recruited 17 women as HEMM operators under its Women@Mines initiative. The initiative aims to provide technical training to unskilled women workers and enable them to work in core jobs in mines. The women HEMM operators are currently under training and will be deployed in mining operations early next year, the statement said. In a similar module, the onboarded transgenders will also be trained for a year before they begin working in mines.

""From the formation of MOSAIC, the company’s diversity and inclusion initiative, in 2015 to participation in RISE – the largest job fair for LGBTQ in Asia, to recruiting transgenders now, Tata Steel has not only evolved as a global torchbearer but has also encouraged others to be inclusive,"" the statement said.",442,0.9717083215713501

Tata Steel will focus on augmenting iron ore production from 30 million tonne per annum to 45 mtpa in the next five years, a company official said on Saturday. The total iron ore production from the steelmakers' captive mines in Noamundi in Jharkhand and in Katamati, Joda and Khondbond blocks in Odisha, is about 30 mtpa, he said.

""In the next five years, we will focus on increasing iron ore production capacity to 45 mtpa in line with the expansion in the steel making facilities in the country,"" company's ore, mines and quarries (OMQ) division general manager Atul Kumar Bhatnagar said. He, however, claimed that the present capacity is sufficient to meet the iron ore requirement in Tata Steel's manufacturing facilities in Jharkhand's Jamshedpur and Odisha's Kalinganagar.

The steelmaker had started its iron ore mining operation at Noamundi in 1925 and the mine will turn 100 in 2025, he said. During the 5th National Conclave on Mines & Minerals in New Delhi on November 23, Noamundi iron ore mine was accorded the 'five-star rating' for three consecutive years from 2017-18 for sustainable development.

Asked about the use of drones in the mining sector, Bhatnagar said it is being deployed for surveying and monitoring purposes. As part of the sustainable development of the block, a solar power plant spread over 19.2 acres of mined-out land was installed in 2017 in Naomundi, he said, adding that the green cover has also been increased in the area.",263,0.7986968954404196

Anand Rathi's research report on Tata Steel

The Consolidated revenue increased during the quarter by 12.9% QoQ and 54.8% YoY to Rs. 602.8 billion. Tata Steel achieved a new highest ever quarterly consolidated EBITDA of Rs. 164.5 billion, which reflects a margin of 27.3%. The consolidated profit after tax was also one of the highest at Rs. 123.6 billion with a net profit margin of 20.5%. During the quarter, Tata steel standalone business deliveries improved 10.4 % QoQ to 4.58 mn tons, While consolidated front steel production fell by 1.4% to 7.77 mn tons, steel deliveries increased by 3.9% to 7.39 mn tons in Q2 FY22 over Q1 FY22. As compared with Q2 FY21, the steel production is higher by 7.2% but deliveries are lower by 6.8%, despite market demand contraction amidst seasonal weakness, and this is a testament to their strong customer relationships and a superior distribution network. Sales volume to the Automotive segment increased by 18% QoQ despite semiconductor shortage driven weakness in the sector.



Outlook

After a strong performance in H1FY22, we expect the rest of the year to be stronger for Tata Steel standalone operations. Domestic steel prices are at a discount to import parity prices allowing companies to push through price hikes. Iron ore integration in the domestic operations enables the company to capture the increase in steel prices in profits. European operations are also expected to remain profitable with an improvement in spreads which lead to further fall in net debt over FY22-FY24 even though Tata Steel will continue to pursue growth capex in India. Hence, we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with target price of Rs. 1,776.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Steel

TATA steel (TATA) reported Q2FY22 EBITDA below our estimates/consensus estimates (CE) by 19%/14% at Rs164.6bn (+2% QoQ). The miss was due to lower margins in both domestic and Tata steel Europe (TSE) operations. Sentiments on Chinese demand turned negative over last quarter. Contrary to historical trend of China pushing volumes in the exports market at unfeasible prices levels in wake of soft domestic demand, the flow of Chinese steel exports has been significantly contained this time with stringent curbs on production. Nonetheless, Chinese steel prices came under pressure with fall of ~15% over last couple of months due to lower iron ore prices and weak demand. As expected, margins were expected to soften due to unsustainable coking coal prices. Having said that, FY23e margins would average out at significantly above historical averages by ~35-40% due to structural withdrawal of Chinese supplies and better outlook on demand.



Outlook

Driven by attractive valuations and strong B/S, we reiterate BUY rating with TP of Rs1,835 (earlier Rs1,850) based on EV/EBITDA of 6.0x FY23e.

In terms of profit and profitability, give us a picture on the performance in Q2 and the outlook for Q3.

We are expecting demand in India to continue picking up as the recovery from the pandemic picks up speed. We expect construction activity to keep increasing post monsoon and the auto industry to pick up as the semiconductor shortage eases. I think in multiple ways we are positive that the next few quarters will be strong from a demand point of view.

From a margin point of view, yes, there will be some pressure because you will see the impact of rising coking coal prices as it flows to other costs. I know prices dropping helps us from a royalty point of view because we pay royalty based on the market price of iron ore. In overall margins, we'll see some shrinkage but not significant.

The way I see it, our forecast for Q3 and Q4 is flattish on a consolidated basis, flattish EBITDA because some geographies will be slightly better and some geographies slightly worse overall.

Volumes will be better in Europe in Q3 than in Q2, India Q3 volumes will be similar to Q2. So, overall we expect the Q3 performance to be similar to Q2. If you just look at the standalone business, it is actually about 40 percent EBITDA margin and can get much better. We can compare if it drops a few points here and there.

Why was the EBITDA per tonne from India operations below expectations?

I think where the market has been a bit disappointed is, when you look at the consolidated margin of the India business, we had a 1,100 crore hit because of the royalty outflow. This was more than we had budgeted for because the MMDR Act changed and even in legal entity subsidiaries that we own 100 percent or we have majority ownership, there is a royalty payment required now higher than what we had budgeted. So, that hit us a bit in Q2 but not because of fundamental price factors. The price guided was Rs 3,000 and we had better realisations of Rs 3,500. Bhushan realisations were slightly lower because we had extra slabs sold from Tata Steel Bhushan to Tata Steel Kalinganagar.

Will the royalty expense that hit you in Q2 recur in Q3 and Q4 or will you be able to mitigate it?

A big part of the royalty is because of Tata Steel BSL, which is now getting merged with Tata Steel. So, I think 70 percent of the problem goes away. The balance 30 percent of the problem is with Tata Metaliks, which takes iron ore from Tata Steel and Tata Steel Long Products. Now, Tata Steel Long Products, we actually have our own mines, and we are looking to see how we can get more volumes there so that there is no differential royalty on sale. We are working on the best way to optimise this.

What’s your outlook for steel prices in Q3 and Q4? What are the factors at play?

The structural changes in global steel prices are here to stay. One is, of course, governments across the world, including India, spending on infrastructure. The spend has just started trickling in, even in India. The infrastructure spend is going to keep increasing.

The world’s steel consumption is growing at 49 percent, largely because of geographies like India, and also the US and places like that. Even Europe is 14-15% higher than last year. So, I think the developed world and developing countries other than China are going to lead this.

Secondly, the cost structures have changed and will stay on a higher level. Coking coal prices are still higher than what steel prices were three years back. So, input costs are high. A lot of consumables that the steel industry buys out of China are going up in terms of prices as China cuts production in those areas.

China is no longer exporting as aggressively as it used to a few years back. So, overall, I think there will be a lot more discipline in steel markets globally. There will be fewer disruptions. There will be volatility — that's the nature of the industry — but at a higher level. What we have guided on steel prices is that India realisations in Q3 will be about Rs 2,500 per tonne higher than in Q2 and Europe realisations will be about 30-40 pounds per tonne higher than in Q2.

How is the price outlook for European units in particular, given the fact that carbon emission norms are getting much tighter? How will the shift towards green steel impact financials?

So, what's happening is there is already a carbon cost of operations there in Europe. The carbon cost today is going from about 10-15 pounds a tonne to about 65 pounds per tonne. So, already that is going up and is expected to go to 100 pounds by the end of the decade. There is already an incentive to look for greener options, because otherwise you will pay this higher cost.

The second thing is to support the industry and make sure this additional cost in Europe doesn’t work to its disadvantage. The European Union has proposed a carbon border adjustment mechanism so that imports of steel into Europe will also pay the carbon tax. European plants and our own Netherlands plant are one of the most carbon-efficient plants in the world. So, the policy is being framed and shaped in a manner that is not unfair to the local industry.

Third, there is hydrogen infrastructure being built; there’s gas infrastructure being built. So, steel plants that want to substitute coal with gas and hydrogen like us have the infrastructure built by the government and there is the promise of gas and hydrogen supply at reasonable prices. All this is coming in place and hence both in the UK and the Netherlands we are making plans in discussion with the government to transition to a greener future with support from the government. Also customers are willing to pay a higher price for greener steel. So, it will be shared between the government and the customer and we should be able to manage that. The cost is typically about $100-150 per tonne.

What will the transitional cost for sustainable steel in Europe for Tata Steel be? Will it impact margins?

The cost will be borne by the industry, government and customers together. European steel prices, because of this reason, will be higher than the world. Technology will also scale up and the $100-150 cost per tonne will come down over time. This is a transition over 10 years, with goals set for 2030.

How will the cost of decarbonisation of steel impact your India business and will it put Tata Steel’s advantage of being a low-cost producer at risk?

In India, currently, policies are not creating … the right incentives to transition faster. I expect now that the government has made an announcement about 2030 goals and 2070 goals, the policy will evolve.

I think it's very important to understand what we learned in Europe. People want to decarbonise without killing the industry. In India, the way I see it today, the only way to improve your carbon footprint is to use more scrap. You don't have hydrogen, you don't have enough gas, so you have to use coal. If you use scrap in your steel production, your carbon footprint can go down. It’s in this context that Tata Steel has set up a recycling facility in Rohtak. We will be setting up more recycling facilities in the Northwest and in southern India. So, that's in some sense, our strategic move in anticipation of the changes that will come.

In India, it’s a two-stage process. First and foremost, we are looking to see if we can have gas available in eastern India, where most of our facilities are. If it is available at an economical price and with assured supply, then we can look at creating future capacities using gas. And eventually, when hydrogen is available, you can substitute gas with hydrogen, but we are many years away from there. So, we will try our transition in India keeping pace with the policy that can support this change.

What’s Tata Steel’s debt reduction plan for this financial year?

In the last six months, we have reduced it by Rs 11,000 crore. By the end of the year our Net debt/EBITDA will be less than 1.",1423,0.5742566833893458

Tata Steel share price added 2 percent intraday on November 11 ahead of the company's scheduled earnings announcement for the second quarter of FY22 later today.

Tata Steel is expected to post a sevenfold increase in net profit from a year ago and a 60 percent rise in revenue in the three months ended September, aided by higher volumes and realisations, analysts said.

On a quarterly basis, profit may improve by 25-30 percent while revenue could increase by about 13 percent, they said.

Steel realisation is expected to increase 2 percent q-o-q and 71 percent y-o-y led by higher steel prices in the domestic market, sequential increase in exports and a price reset in contracted volumes, Kotak Institutional Equities said.

Volumes are expected to rise 18 percent q-o-q to 4.5 million tonnes on the easing of pandemic restrictions. However, on a yearly basis, this 8 percent lower on a high base and a price-led pushback, it added.

Analysts remain bullish on metals like steel, aluminium, zinc and nickel, which is positive for various Indian manufacturers including Tata Steel, JSW Steel, SAIL, Hindalco, Vedanta and Hindustan Zinc.

In the case of steel, domestic consumption slumped because of the pandemic-induced lockdowns, but Indian companies could cash in on the high global price by increasing its exports.

Aluminium soared to a 13-year high of $3,000 per tonne this month in London Metal Exchange (LME) on supply concerns. The price surge was triggered by the political turmoil in Guinea, a major producer of bauxite that goes into the making of aluminium, and a cut in production by China, the largest aluminium producer, to control carbon emission from mines.

Aluminium prices have been rising since the latter half of 2020 with gradual increase in consumption.

“Demand for metals has increased with stimulus packages in various countries boosting consumption. The supply shortages from China led to an increase in prices. As a result, the profitability of metal manufacturers has improved,” said Harsha Shetty, chief marketing officer of Vedanta Ltd.

Though aluminium prices have fallen to about $2,850 per tonne, they remain over 60 percent higher than a year ago. “The demand for aluminium is increasing globally. Copper has become so expensive that manufacturers, especially of air conditioners, are gradually switching to aluminium as it conducts heat and is light in weight,” said Prathamesh Mallya, AVP research, commodities and currencies, Angel Broking.

The outlook is positive for aluminium producers. “The prices may remain in the range of $2,500-2,600 per tonne for the next few years,” said Shetty. India’s aluminium production dropped marginally to 3.65 million tonnes in FY20. But the exports increased by 25 percent to 1.9 million tonnes in the year. Though final figures are not available for FY21, the production is expected to be 3.5-4 percent lower than previous year.

Revival of construction, automobile and white goods production in China and Western countries increased the price of steel. Other factors like mounting iron ore prices and China’s decision to cut steel production to curb carbon emission, reduce exports to cater to local demand also made steel costly. The country’s decision to encourage import by removing duties benefitted countries like India which relied more on exports after the pandemic.

The global rally impacted India also but prices in the country were about 20 percent lower than the international level as the domestic consumption was weak. Indian steel raised exports to gain from high prices when local demand was low.

According to steel industry sources, exports rose 29 percent in FY21 over the previous year to 10.78 million tonnes while the domestic consumption dropped 6 percent to 94.14 million tonnes.

The robust export trend continues. In April-August 2021, exports rose 13 percent to 6.40 million tonnes compared to the same period in the previous year. Steel consumption for the five -month period increased by 45 percent to 40.84 million tonnes.

In July this year, the benchmark hot rolled coil (HRC) steel prices jumped to about Rs 70,000 per tonne, almost two times the level a year ago, on the back of an increase in iron ore prices. But the prices eased as the state-owned National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) cut the iron ore rates.

“Indian prices are Rs 4,000-Rs 5,000 per tonne lower than the international prices. The current average prices are in the range of Rs 62,000-Rs 65,000 per tonne Since the demand is rising the prices may remain at a higher level and may not touch last year’s level,” said Noor Muhammed Noorsha, MD of Kalliyath Steel.

India’s steel demand dropped by 12.6 percent to 89.3 million tonnes in 2020 from a year earlier, while production fell 10.6 percent to 99.6 million tonnes during the year. Indian steel demand is projected to rise to 104.3 million tonnes in 2021, 2 percent above the demand in 2019, and to 111.4 million tonnes in 2022.

This month, nickel prices surged to a seven year-high of $20,500 per tonne in LME as steel demand rose. Besides its use in stainless steel production, nickel is in great demand from electric vehicle manufacturers for making batteries.

Though it has dipped to $19,000 per tonne level, nickel is costlier by 35-40 percent from last year. With the largest supplier Indonesia exploring the possibility of levying export taxes on nickel, prices are expected to remain high Indian stainless-steel production dropped 19 percent to 3.2 million tonnes in 2020. According to the Indian Stainless Steel Development Association it is projected to rise to 3.5 million tonnes in 2021. The association has expressed concern about rising import of stainless-steel products from Indonesia.",803,0.12079159542918205

Indian markets succumbed to profit-booking on September 20 amid weak global cues. At close, the Sensex was down 524.96 points, or 0.89 percent, at 58,490.93, and the Nifty was down 188.30 points, or 1.07 percent, at 17,396.90.

The correction in broader markets was more intense as the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell 1.8 percent each, while the volatility increased significantly with India VIX climbing nearly 15 percent to 17.5.

Stocks that were in focus included Apollo Pipes which rallied 7.5 percent to close at Rs 1,655.6. Hindustan Unilever, which was the biggest gainer in the BSE Sensex with a 2.84 percent rally. On the other hand, Tata Steel was the biggest loser in the BSE Sensex, down 9.5 percent.

Here's what Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Apollo Pipes

The stock scaled a record high crossing its previous peak highs near to Rs 1,200 levels, and moved higher by 33 percent from its previous high.

We believe it has completed its bullish stance over the past eight weeks and expect it to underperform or witness a corrective action from current levels.

We would recommend booking profit as higher volumes are lacking in the current momentum.

Hindustan Unilever

The stock has started to outperform after a long time in the current quarter with positive momentum in the sector.

On the downside, the stock has support near to Rs 2,650 levels with respect to its previous top term which would act as strong support now.

We would recommend holding the stock. The current upmove can lead the stock higher near to Rs 3,000 levels.

Tata Steel

The stock has witnessed sharp profit booking after a Head and Shoulder pattern breakdown on weekly charts.

The sector has been underperforming in the current upmove and has declined by 5 percent compared to 12 percent upmove in the Nifty.

It has closed at strong support of its 100-day average and we expect some bounce back. We would recommend holding the stock which has a target of Rs 1,320.

Tata Steel introduced the use of electric vehicles (EVs) for transportation of finished steel at Jamshedpur after the successful launch of the initiative earlier at the Sahibabad Plant in Uttar Pradesh, a company release said.

As part of its commitment to sustainability, the private steel major has now extended the facility in Jamshedpur with the inaugural run organised from Billet Yard to Beekay Steel Plant on Wednesday.

Tata Steel has tied up with an Indian start-up to pursue its aspiration of deploying EVs for transportation of finished steel. Tata Steel has a contract for deployment of 27 EVs having a minimum carrying capacity of 35 tonne of steel. The company plans to deploy 15 EVs at its Jamshedpur Plant and 12 EVs at its Sahibabad plant, the release said.

The Indian market is on a record-breaking spree, with the benchmarks indices scaling new highs powered by sectors like IT, metal and oil & gas.

Among the top-performing stocks of the Nifty, the gains in Tata Steel this year have been a pleasant surprise for investors. The Tata Steel stock has surged 122 percent year-to-date, while the Nifty metal index has clocked a gain of 75 percent. The benchmark Nifty has risen 24 percent during the period.

Such a steep rise in the stock has raised concerns that the stock is overbought and may correct soon. The stock has closed in the red for the last two sessions.

With signs of economic revival and rising steel prices globally, the stock found itself in a sweet spot.

Tata Steel posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,768.34 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. The steel giant incurred a net loss of Rs 4,648.13 crore in the year-ago period. Total income zoomed to Rs 53,534.04 crore in the quarter under review from Rs 25,662.43 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.

Tracking growth

Tata Steel looks on a steady path for the coming quarters as well. The company plans a capital expenditure of Rs 8,000-crore for its India operations year in the current financial year.

In its investors’ presentation on September 6, the company said it intends to reduce its gross debt by more than $2 billion, while prioritising off-shore debt pre-payment in FY22. It is also planning a capital expenditure of Rs 10,000-12,000 crore in the current financial year.

Consolidated net debt of Tata Steel has declined by 28 percent as on March 21 and it is ahead of schedule in terms of its debt repayment, Jitesh Ranawat, Head, Institutional Sales, Marwadi Shares and Finance, said.

""We expect the company to merge Tata BSL with itself and also accelerate its capex programme in Kalinganagar, which will give a fillip to its capacities in India which had the highest EBITDA last quarter,"" said Ranawat, referring to the company’s facility in Odisha.

The key would be the movement of steel prices. Any major correction will be an opportunity to invest in Tata Steel as the stock has factored in lots of good news so far.

""Investors with a six-month view need to buy on dips as they can make more than 20 percent on it if the steel prices sustain at these levels for another six months. The stock currently trades at five times FY22E,"" Ranawat said.

Global financial firm JPMorgan has an “overweight” view on Tata Steel with a target price of Rs 1,810.

""The company reported its highest ever quarterly EBITDA and PAT despite volume being hit by the second wave of the pandemic. Tata Steel's debt declined further on a QoQ basis even after a substantial working capital build,"" JPMorgan pointed out.

Recently, global brokerage firm UBS maintained a “buy” call on the stock while raising the target price to Rs 1,800 from Rs 1,400.

The stock should definitely be a buy-on-dips candidate as it has broken out from a huge consolidation with an increase in volumes and a clear buy crossover in its momentum indicators.

""The short-term momentum indicators are overbought, hence there can be some consolidation which will be quite healthy for the stock going forward,” said Jay Thakkar, Vice President and Head of Equity Research at Marwadi Shares and Finance.

In the near term, resistance is pegged at Rs 1,535 and support at Rs 1,250. One can buy around the support levels for the long term as the metals are in an upward super cycle, Jay Thakkar said.

Decarbonising the steel industry in India is a challenge because of the costs and technologies involved as well the absence of a proper carbon market, but the country has to move in that direction as it is a signatory to the Paris Agreement, ED & CFO of Tata Steel Koushik Chatterjee.

Will India stand to lose its low-cost advantage in this new era of ‘Sustainable Steel?’ Moneycontrol’s Nisha Poddar caught up with Chatterjee to discuss these issues with the steel industry veteran who is now very active in Tata Steel’s sustainable steel strategy. Edited excerpts:

How is sustainability thrust impacting the manufacturing business?

We in steel or other processing industries or automotive, or oil and gas, do have a carbon footprint, which needs to get abated and it is hard to abate in steel primarily because technology is not available in the scale in which we want. There is a huge amount of work going on in the steel industry as well as in other industries to reduce the impact of carbon, and most companies or industries are looking at developing a decarbonisation pathway. These things don't happen in a month or a quarter, or even years. It takes some time to actually mature and scale in the way in which it can meaningfully mitigate emission levels.

Steel is the very foundation for an economy, therefore the world cannot do without steel, and therefore most manufacturing companies including steel companies are developing their own decarbonisation pathway, either through initiatives which are important for the legacy assets as well as for companies which are growing, especially in countries like India or other developing countries where the growth in steel is required, looking at a hybrid model of choosing alternative technologies, which then becomes one of the ways in which decarbonisation can be achieved.

With the challenges of technology and costs of decarbonisation, do you think India may lose its advantage of being a low-cost producer of steel?

Not really, I think it is in a very good position because of multiple reasons: One, it has the factors of steel, which is what makes it globally competitive as an industry in India. We have the skills, we have the raw materials, we have the customers. So you can’t have a more favorable combination, as we have seen in the past. As far as decarbonisation is concerned, India doesn't yet have a carbon market; there is no allowance market or a trading market. But India is a signatory to the Paris Agreement, and will comply with the undertakings that the country is given, and is well on its course. As India grows bigger and bigger, and puts in a lot more steel per capita of its population, there will be ways in which that pathway will develop … We will have the ability to develop new technologies indigenously as well as from best practices across the world, to ensure that we remain competitive, so I am very optimistic about India's future.

Where does the carbon credit market stand at this point of time and what could be the unit economics for steel produced in the medium term?

The carbon credits market is more widely traded in EU. Companies get free allowances, based on past production as well as expected production, and that is now being kept constant. If there is a company which needs more allowances they have to essentially buy those carbon emission rights, and that has been increasing over the last few years. It used to be very low, but it's now 50-53 euros per tonne. So that's adding to costs. India doesn't have an allowance regime as yet. It has a regime which is the PAT regime, which Perform Achieve and Trade, which is put forward to you and trade, which is in its nascent form. we need more liquidity into it. We need more participants into it. (It) adds to the cost for those who are deficit. I think there is a cost which is the transition cost to a decarbonisation pathway. But fundamentally, if I were to look at it, companies have to first eliminate reduce, avoid, and then they will be also a residual piece of carbon which will be offset through the the offset market , which has also not happened in the past globally but I see there is a significant amount of effort to have one offset carbon offset market, which gives transparency, credibility, and more importantly, use the offset proceeds for me to be solution solutions, right, so I think India will kind of move towards that path in, I hope in the future. But I think at this point of time. We don't have an allowance-based market in India this is not in the offing at this point in time for my knowledge, but there is a PAT scheme which is in effect.

The carbon credit market is more in the EU. India doesn't have an allowance regime as yet. It has a regime which is the VAT regime, which is put forward to you and trade, which is in its nascent form. We need more liquidity in it. We need more participants in it and sure that is the way to go.

I think there is a cost which is the transition cost to a decarbonisation pathway. And, but fundamentally, if I were to look at it, companies have to first eliminate, reduce, avoid, and then there will be also a residual piece of carbon which will be offset through the carbon offset market, which has also not happened in the past usually but I see there is a significant amount of effort to have one carbon offset market ... I think India will kind of move towards that path, I hope in the future. But I think at this point of time, we don't have an allowance-based market in India. This is not in the offing at this point in time, to my knowledge.

India does not generate enough scrap, so that also could be a constraint?

Which is why you see the new scrappage policy is actually a carbon friendly policy as it provides that there will be redundancy of automotive cars; scrap being produced over the next five-seven years. It also depends on the state of the economy because as economies mature, consumption of white goods, cars automobiles etc, increases and then the scrappage turns into a useful circular product, which can be recycled. We see that happening in China now. But even China is just about starting to produce more scrap so scrap-related technology is also improving. Energy consumption needs to be more from green sources, which is the kind of integrated work that needs to happen. India has a very large domestic market in steel, therefore I think compared to other markets, India is in a good position to actually be more circular, as in when the scrappage numbers become more material.

The biggest outcome of COVID-19 situation has been the digital thrust. Tata Steel essentially a B2B company with a small portion of B2C element is now going even more aggressive, especially with the fabricated panels. How do you see this particular space developing?

We are investing significantly to be digitally more agile, within the company all our functional processes, and externally also to reach the market and the customer in a more digitally smart way, and I think that's where we have startup cultures within the businesses … So I think digital is the way to go. Tata Steel is very customer-centric. We will continue to be in very close touch with the customer, both physically as well as from an online and digital platforms, and our distribution and supply chain is very strong and efficient, to ensure that wherever the customer is, there are products, which can reach them in a very efficient manner. So, I think digital is just not a buzzword, it's what we live through and we are investing heavily on these platforms so that we can become bigger and bigger, and access customers and ensure that the customer experiences are to their own expectation and even beyond.",1360,-0.09178276572908674

Steel prices are buoyant across the globe and Tata Steel has been a big beneficiary of the bull run in this commodity. If inorganic opportunities come, Tata Steel will look at them from merit, from what value we can create out of it, and what value we can put into it, says Koushik Chatterjee, ED & CFO of Tata Steel.

What about steel price dynamics? We’ve seen raw material prices going up. Every sector is facing inflationary pressures and supply constraints. What are the factors at play to help you offset the cost pressure?

Chatterjee: So, the raw material is also a commodity which is going through its own upcycle at this point of time, and we see this in raw material prices. I think that has been certainly increasing, and it is a function of supply and demand, and so we have seen an increase in iron ore prices for a long part of the last six months. It’s now going down, so these volatilities happen.

It’s important to understand the spreads. I think we are very firm and focused on ensuring that we manage the spreads in the best possible manner to return efficiencies. It is within the spread that you make your margins.

As far as Europe is concerned, what you saw essentially is a lag effect of these bond spreads and the long-term contract spreads. The European business generally follows a larger proportionality of contracts, which is one year, six months, three months, etc. Therefore, when new contracts are renewed, it comes at a higher specs than what we've seen in the past. That will get corrected.

It's a time-deferred issue, and, therefore, it is going to get corrected in the second quadrant. We’re already seeing that impact and the stretch will increase, but the fact is that because of where the market is, where the broader supply demand is, spreads are certainly at a much higher and comfortable level.

What about prices of steel and Tata Steel’s realisations this quarter?

Chatterjee: I think the spreads in Europe, in particular, is going to expand materially, and, in India, they will hold.

There is already an investigation underway on charges of cartelisation of the steel industry in India. Will that impact Tata Steel’s pricing power?

Chatterjee: The best answer is to say is that the steel industry is a global industry. Therefore, no one or two or a few people can have that. I think it is a benchmark to the rest of the world.

I think it is the way in which we actually work, with our customers and distributors and engineers, to ensure that the price formulation is in a manner which is linked or aligned to the product’s market movements. I think that's how this business works. This is how pricing works. It is not something that any one person or a few can influence. It is the same pattern of supply-demand dynamics. It also depends on how the economy is growing.

What is Tata Steel’s strategy for gaining more iron ore mines in India over the next few years?

Chatterjee: As far as new leases are concerned, you know there is a very transparent way of auctioning now in the country. We participate in the ones which meet our requirements or to the extent it meets our option levels. That’s how it will happen in in the future as well.

The government has stated its position on selling RINL & NINL. How aggressive will Tata Steel be, especially with regards to NINL?

Chatterjee: I think it's important to say that it is seen as a very strong organic pipeline. And we will pursue that pipeline in line with the market growth. As you know, we are very aggressively looking at completing our expansion in Korea. Beyond that, we do have further plans to grow the business in India. If inorganic opportunities come, we will look at them from merit, from what value we can create out of it, and what value we can put into it.

And, finally, on your overall strategy. Will it be a value play or a volume play for Tata Steel, going forward, and second, to be future-ready for an imminent probable downside, because it's a cyclical play, how are you safeguarding your position, especially in reducing debt levels?

Chatterjee: So, it's a value play with volume, so it's not either or. I think we mentioned earlier that we have a very strong pipeline, which we will certainly go through, and, therefore, it will create more value for us. We are very focused on profitability, cash flows and balance sheet.

We are also focused on new businesses like new materials businesses and so on. So, it's not binary as value is involved, that is volume. I think the market is going to become bigger and bigger. So I think there is space for everyone, we will be playing our part in terms of aiding our focus areas, providing value to our customers and also ensuring that our profitability and cash flows are the best as far as the business cycle is concerned. We play the market but I think it's very important to ensure that our own competitiveness and our focus on that never gets diluted.",906,0.691296534878867

Domestic steel giant Tata Steel is interested in acquiring state-owned Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), the company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Managing Director T V Narendran said.

RINL, under the Ministry of Steel, owns and operates a 7.3 million tonnes plant in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. It holds the distinction of being India's first shore-based integrated steel plant.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on January 27, gave its ''in-principle'' approval for 100 per cent disinvestment of government stake in RINL, also called Visakhapatnam Steel Plant or Vizag Steel, along with RINL's stake in its subsidiaries/joint ventures through strategic disinvestment by way of privatisation.

When asked about Tata Steel's interest in acquiring RINL, Narendran replied in affirmative.

""Yes! Also, because for inorganic growth for long product opportunities... There is a great opportunity because it is east as well as it is south, it is a coastal plant so there are many advantages...,"" he told PTI.

RINL has approximately 22,000 acre of land and enjoys access to Gangavaram Port, where raw materials such as coking coal etc arrives.

Since RINL is located on the eastern coast of India, the acquisition will give Tata Steel more access to the South East Asian markets -- where the company already has presence -- besides catering to the domestic needs of special steel through rail and road.

The CEO further said Tata Steel has submitted Expression of Interest (EoI) for Odisha-based steel maker Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL) as well. NINL is a joint venture company, in which four central PSUs -- MMTC, National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) and MECON -- and two Odisha government companies IPICOL and Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC) are shareholders.

In January 2020, the Centre gave an in-principle approval for strategic sale of NINL by allowing the six PSU shareholders to sell their stake in the steel company.

The EOI has been submitted by Tata Steel Long Products Ltd, he said. Narendran said, ""we have done the due diligence, we are participating in the process. I think we have some time to put in our bids etc. So, we will take a call, when we need to decide. We have submitted the EoI but not as Tata steel but as Tata Steel Long Products.

Kolkata-based Tata Steel Long Products is in the business of manufacturing high alloy steel, primarily for the auto sector and wire rope industry. With one million tonne capacity, it is one of the largest specialty steel plants in India in the long product segment.",433,0.9500427842140198

Tata Steel share price touched a 52-week high of Rs 1,498.45, up 2.5 percent in the early trade on August 16 after the company reported its June quarter earnings.

On August 12, the company posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,768.34 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2021.

It had posted net loss of Rs 4,648.13 crore in the year-ago period.

Expenses were at Rs 41,397.23 crore as against Rs 29,116.37 crore earlier.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after the June quarter earnings:

Kotak Institutional Equities | Rating: Buy | Target: Raised to Rs 1,750

The research house maintained buy on the stock as the management commentary suggests India margin to sustain in coming quarters and Europe margin could increase by 1-2x from Q1.

Despite growth capex, net debt/ EBITDA is likely to sustain at <1x over FY22-24, while strong steel prices & management guidance to drive the earnings.

JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 1,810

JPMorgan has kept overweight call on the stock as Europe to improve sharply over FY22 and India ASP/t to be higher in Q2.

There is a large net debt reduction ahead and see upside risks if Chinese steel production cuts continue.

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,565

With captive iron ore availability, Tata’s Indian operations are a play on steel prices. Given the prevailing high prices, we expect margin to remain strong. We estimate 2QFY22 EBITDA at Rs 200b (+23% QoQ), with standalone EBITDA/t of Rs 36,574/t (record high).

While TSE’s EBITDA should be strong in FY22, sustenance would be key to meeting its cash outflow requirements (capex, debt, and interest).

Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,950

Tata Steel reported Q1FY22 EBITDA above our estimates by 3.5% (in line with consensus estimates) on back of better than expected margins in domestic operations, offset by lower margins in Tata Steel Europe (TSE).

Structurally global steel cost curve would increase by ~US100/t due to higher costs associated with reducing carbon footprint. This coupled with improved outlook on global demand and reduced supplies from China would sustain steel prices on elevated levels in medium term.

Management shared capacity allocation policy focusing on 1) expanding upstream steel capacity in India by 15mnt beyond FY25 to 40mnt, 2) augmenting downstream capacity with investment in CR, DI pipes, Tinplate, Tubes and Wires, 3) entering businesses like EAF based steel, niche new materials business with product offerings of composites and Graphene and 4) expand infrastructure and logistics to support the movement of expanded steel capacity. Capex intensity would almost double based on annual capex guidance of Rs100bn-120bn for next five years. However, strong earnings outlook and investment in high payback projects in India allays concerns associated with sharp rise in capex.



Outlook

This is vindicated by company’s guidance on maintain Net debt/EBITDA at 2x across the earning cycle. Underpinned by strong outlook on steel prices, comfortable B/S and impressive growth drivers, we remain positive on stock with Accumulate rating and TP of Rs1,400 (earlier Rs1,330), EV/EBITDA of 5.7x FY23e.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel (TATA)’s FY21 Annual Report highlights the ambition of the company to maintain leadership in volumes, cost, and sustainability. With improved cash flows, the focus is back on growing the India business, wherein it aims to double capacity to 35–40mt by 2030. However, it plans to tread cautiously on this path as debt repayment remains the focal point for the management. On Tata Steel Europe (TSE), the management palpably appears concerned about the tightening emission norms in Europe, rising carbon credit costs, and the resulting lower competitiveness against imports to Europe, which pose a key challenge in the longer term. While we expect deleveraging to continue on the back of higher prices, rising carbon costs and the burden of sustainability capex in TSE are key concerns, in our view. Thus, we assign a Neutral rating, with TP of INR1,210.



Outlook

We arrive at our TP of INR1,210/sh on FY23E EV/EBITDA of 5x for its India operations and 4x for Europe. Our TP implies EV/capacity of USD902/t, a 30% premium to the past five-year average of USD700/t to factor in the benefit from likely deleveraging from the current upcycle. Given limited upside, we however rate it Neutral.

Tata Group chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran is optimistic about the steel industry’s prospects in the post-pandemic era, citing strategic moves the conglomerate has made in recent years to reinforce its structural and financial strengths and tap future opportunities.

“The steel industry is also entering a phase which will see better spreads enabled by robust demand and geo-political factors,” Chandrasekaran said in the annual report of Tata Steel released today.

“The strategic moves your Company has made over the last few years has given it the structural and financial strength to capture the opportunities that arise going forward, while ensuring its resilience in the face of uncertainty and a dynamic operating environment,” the group and company chairman said in a message addressed to shareholders.

Chandrasekaran added: “As we continue to position ourselves to capitalise on the opportunities of the coming decade, we will strive to be a leader in the transition to a greener economy – aiming to create a virtuous cycle of growth and returns for our shareholders”.

Tata Steel posted record consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, or EBITDA, a measure of profitability, in the 2020-21 financial year. The performance was driven by higher steel prices, better product mix and measures to boost efficiency.

EBITDA excludes expenses associated with debt by adding back interest and taxes and serves as a metric of a company’s earnings before accounting and financial deductions.

Chandrasekaran wrote: “In FY 2020-21, your Company achieved its highest ever consolidated EBITDA of Rs 30,892 crore with 71% Y-o-Y growth, translating to an EBITDA per tonne of Rs 10,838 and an EBITDA margin of ~20%.”

In the year, the company also recorded its highest-ever free cash flow of Rs 23,748 crore. Chandrasekaran said the cash flow had been driven by efficient management of working capital and a strong focus on cash.

Tata Steel’s domestic operations are becoming cash-positive. “Tata Steel India was cash positive in Q1FY2021, a significant achievement given the pandemic. Company has reclassified Tata Steel South East Asia operations to 'Continuing Operations' from 'Held for Sale', on the back of a 50% increase in EBITDA to Rs 549 crore. This was enabled by higher prices and a focus on raw material cost reduction,” Chandrasekaran said

Tata Steel India, Tata Steel Netherlands and Tata Steel UK have ventured into the steel recycling business, which he called “a definitive step towards a lower footprint production process across emissions, resource-use and energy consumption.

He noted that during the year, the company sent out its first raw material consignment of ferrous scrap for trials from its scrap processing plant\ in Haryana’s Rohtak

In the post-pandemic era, the world will inevitably be different, the group chairman predicted.

“Recent years have been marked, for example, by elevated geo-political volatility, accelerated technology disruption and greater action to mitigate climate risks, among other important global trends,” he said in the message coinciding with the second wave of Covid-19 infections in India.

“The pandemic has accelerated many of these shifts, while underscoring the pace at which we need to act to remain ahead of the curve”.",522,0.8137209547890557

Tata Steel BSL has set up a 100-bed COVID-19 hospital facility near its plant in Odisha's Dhenkanal district.

Petroleum and Natural Gas and Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan inaugurated the COVID-19 hospital facility virtually on Monday evening.

Situated at the Kharagprasad Regional Higher Secondary School under Odapada block of the district, the hospital has 50 beds with piped oxygen, 40 beds with oxygen concentrators and 10 ventilator supported ICU beds apart from other medical equipment necessary for providing secondary level care to COVID-19 patients.

Commending Tata Steel BSL and district administration for developing the hospital so fast, Pradhan, said, 'this hospital will strengthen health infrastructure of the region, particularly the people of Dhenkanal and Angul.' Odisha's Health and Family Welfare Minister N K Das said this hospital will go a long way in supporting the fight against COVID in the region. With more facility for treatment of COVID patients coming up in interior areas, this will help the patients to get quality healthcare service at the right time, instead of visiting cities.

Thanking the government for constant support during the execution of this project, T V Narendran, Chairman, Tata Steel BSL said Tata Steel and Tata Group have been working with the government both at the Centre and state to fight the COVID-19.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Steel

Led by better than expected performance in domestic operations, TATA steel (TATA) reported 6%/8% beat on our/consensus EBITDA estimates. Consolidated EBITDA grew 48% QoQ at Rs141.8bn (PLe:Rs130.9bn). PAT doubled QoQ to Rs76.4bn (PLe:Rs70.1bn). Beat was largely led by strong show in standalone/TATA steel BSL operations with EBITDA at Rs91.9bn/Rs25.8bn (PLe:Rs86.7bn/Rs22.7bn), up 37% QoQ/58% QoQ. However, TATA Steel Europe (TSE) operations marginally fell short of expectation due to reversal of gain of £47mn recognised on monetisation of carbon credit receipts in Q1FY21.

Outlook

In this backdrop, TATA would be the key beneficiary on back of its integrated operations. TSE would also report better profitability given its high dependence on steel prices. Underpinned by strong steel outlook and comfortable B/S, we maintain Accumulate rating with TP of Rs1,330, EV/EBITDA of 5.7x FY23e.

The Nifty Metal index fell by about 2 percent on Wednesday after Credit Suisse downgraded its rating on the metals pack from overweight to underweight, CNBC-TV18 reported quoting the global investment bank Strategy note.

Credit Suisse reversed its positions made in December 2020, and booked profits in the metal pack as Price-to-book (P/B) value relative to the market is near a 10-year high. It further added that the value can even go higher and remain elevated, but the rise is not structural, cautions the note.

The global investment bank is of the view that the current surge in apparent demand is due to an extreme inventory cycle and not a structural increase.

Reacting to the news, stocks like NMDC, Tata Steel, JSW Steel, SAIL, and JSPL fell 2-4 percent each.

Credit Suisse removed Tata Steel from its 30-stock portfolio and added Hindalco.

The investment bank highlighted that CY21 price performance has been extreme, driven by the surge in iron ore prices. The stock has rallied around 300 percent in the last one year, and over 60 percent so far in the year 2021.

“Slower steel capacity increases due to ESG regulations are not sufficient to justify holding on, particularly given the Tata Steel profit surge is iron-ore driven and should correct,” it said.

“Further, with the aluminum-to-steel price ratio near a two-decade low, an inversion is likely - we remove Tata Steel from our 30-stock portfolio and add Hindalco,” it said.

The investment bank has downgraded Tata Steel to Neutral with a target of Rs 1,250. JSPL has also been downgraded to Neutral (from Outperform) with revised target price of Rs 450, reported CNBC-TV18.

Meanwhile, Credit Suisse downgraded JSW Steel to Underperform (from Neutral) with a target of Rs 550. Of all four steel names, JSW is trading at most expensive valuation (2.8x P/B) and its capex intensity would remain high in the near term, it said.

Tata Steel’s fortunes have turned! After almost two decades of struggle with debt management post the Corus acquisition at the peak of the steel cycle in 2006, it is set to make operational profits of Rs 50,000 crore this year if this steel cycle uptrend persists. Tata Steel’s debt levels which were way above Rs 1 lakh crore last year will be reduced below Rs 50,000 crore by next year as steel prices support the performance with global economies re-starting activity in the post-pandemic phase.

Tata Steel’s biggest strength has been the captive iron ore mines, a key raw material for steel, which made it one of the only profitable steel companies in the world during many steel downturns over the years due to its low cost of production.

TV Narendran, Managing Director of Tata Steel, tells Moneycontrol, “If you really look at Tata Steel’s debt, lot of the debt has come because of what we had to do in Europe over the years.”

For the last three years, Tata Steel’s strategy has been to reduce debt by at least a billion dollars every year and that will continue. “Focus on the balance sheet continues and we do believe that the India business in good times and bad times will generate enough cash flows to deleverage,” Tata Steel MD said.

Narendran highlights that “structurally we are moving to a better place, we are helped by the current steel prices.” Global steel prices have helped the UK business of Tata Steel to become EBITDA positive and the company is confident of this to continue while most experts do question the sustainability of current steel prices. The jury is still out on the steel price movement but Tata Steel is hopeful that the UK business will not saddle the growth of the rest of the profitable steel units of the company.

Not eyeing large global acquisitions

Despite comfortable cash position and steel outlook looking strong given China’s lowering dominance, steel major from Tata Group is not looking at a big bang acquisition across the globe. TV Narendran says, “Certainly not outside India, we are looking at inorganic growth within India.”

The focus will be on enhancing the company’s presence in the long steel vertical. “The government has announced the Neelachal disinvestment, we are part of the process, we have put in our EoI through Tata Steel Long Products.”

There aren’t many acquisition targets available in the private sector, Tata Steel shares and points out that the government will open the bids to sell RINL and they will participate in the sale process.

Narrative change on debt in capital-intensive sectors

Burnt by the past experiences of not being able to take the burden of ballooning debt on books, especially, due to the cyclical nature of the steel business, Tata Steel now takes a more prudent approach to its capital allocation strategy. Narendran adds, “India business makes enough cash to support its own growth and we don’t need to have debt on our balance sheet to grow and as we grow we will generate even more cash to support any other incremental growth we need.”

During the Raghuram Rajan-era at the RBI, the Asset Quality Review led to a long phase of debt management and recovery which led to Essar Steel being sold to ArcelorMittal; add to that the uncertainties of COVID pandemic, large business houses are moving towards a debt-free structure. Many major companies' thrust towards equity fundraising and Tata Group’s focus on consolidating current businesses in all verticals after a series of leveraged buyouts over several years are a clear structural shift in the capital utilisation strategies of Corporate India.",621,0.5279963101659503

(TISCO, now Tata Steel), passed away in Kolkata at the ripe old age of 96. Whether his longevity was a consequence of his famous 16-egg omelettes or his insistence on living life on his own terms isn’t clear. Suffice to say, Mody was undoubtedly a rare Indian corporate hero.

Rustomji Homusji Mody, to give his full name, was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. His father, Sir Homy Mody was the governor of Bombay Presidency and Uttar Pradesh and a member of the Indian Legislative Assembly. Young Russi was sent to Harrow School in London and to Oxford’s Christ Church College for his studies. On his return he joined TISCO as an office assistant on a salary of Rs 50 per month. But soaring ambitions and a fierce will to succeed, took him right to the top of the company’s hierarchy. Indeed, so successful was he in his leadership of the steel major that he, and many others, fancied him as J.R.D. Tata’s successor to head the vast Indian conglomerate. It wasn’t an unwarranted expectation since JRD thought so highly of him that in 1984 he resigned as chairman of TISCO just so that Mody could be anointed to that post.

By then he, along with others like Darbari Seth of Tata Chemicals and Ajit Kerkar at Indian Hotels, had emerged as the powerful satraps of the widely-dispersed Tata empire of the 1970s. Once Ratan Tata took over the group’s reins, these men who enjoyed a free hand under JRD, found their wings clipped. While most of them chose to walk away into the sunset, Mody was among those that resisted fiercely even though with the reforms of 1992 altering the fundamentals of Indian business, TISCO was increasingly being found wanting. It had become a lumbering giant with obsolete processes and gross overstaffing which made it vulnerable to competition.

Mody’s successors, under Tata’s watch, restructured the company, making it the highly competitive global powerhouse it is today. While initially, he opposed the changes, even calling his successors “clowns”, eventually he accepted that they had done a great job.

In truth, they were only building on the structure he had created over the previous two decades as managing director and subsequently as chairman. Until the bitter boardroom battle led to his exit, he moulded the company as per his vision and will. Its best could be seen in the quadrupling of its capacity over the years he was in charge, as well its just and humane industrial relations policies. If the first positioned the firm firmly as the country’s steel industry leader, the latter made TISCO a path setter in the nascent human resource field in corporate India. It also allowed the company to function smoothly without losing a single man day to the kind of strikes and bandhs that led to the hemorrhaging of business and industry in the country’s eastern states of West Bengal and Bihar. In fact, when in 1979, the Janata government under Morarji Desai threatened to nationalize TISCO using the 47% stake it had in the company, thousands of the company’s workers led by Mody took to the streets in protest.

Once he had lost out in the succession battle, it was evident his days at the top were numbered. But he chose to fight on and ended up paying for his belligerence, being sacked from the company’s board while he was away in London. In any case, even if Ratan Tata had wanted to be charitable, Mody made sure there was little scope for a rapprochement with some ill-advised remarks against the new chairman. The two did patch up in later years and Mody was magnanimous enough to accept that Ratan Tata had been the right choice to head the group.

That really summed up the man. He was quick to please and equally quick to take offence. But that last didn’t linger too long. There was always golf and his grand piano waiting. More comfortable in wildly floral Hawain shirts, which he would pick based on his mood of the day, and bermudas than in suits, he was a true epicurean. Birthdays, for instance, were celebrated with one-tonne laddoos and a 400 kg cake.

After his exit from TISCO, Mody served briefly as chairman of Air India and Indian Airlines and dabbled briefly in politics, standing for elections as an independent. He also set up a trading house with Aditya Kashyap, his protégé whom he had backed to head the company after him but who lost out when Ratan Tata installed J.J. Irani as his replacement. Even this venture met with limited success and after Kashyap’s untimely death, it was wound up.

Clearly Mody without Tata Steel was a fish out of water. After his exit from Jamshedpur, he chose to settle in Calcutta, a city he loved because, as he told one journalist, “I can stop at a green light and go when the lights are red.”

In the previous session, the share ended at Rs 1,100.55, up Rs 31.60, or 2.96 percent on the BSE after the company turned profitable in the quarter ended March 2021.

The company on May 5 posted a consolidated profit of Rs 6,644.1 crore for the quarter ended March 2021 compared to a loss of Rs 1,481.3 crore in the year-ago quarter.

Consolidated revenue from operations stood at Rs 49,977.4 crore, up 38.8 percent YoY.

TV Narendran, Managing Director, told Moneycontrol that cement demand has seen a sharp decline during lockdown due to slowing construction activity. Construction activity is impacted by two aspects, migrant workers and bottleneck in fabrication sector due to the restriction of liquid oxygen, he said.

When asked on the overall impact on economic activity, he said, ""Seeing some signs of activity slowing down not very material yet. Demand may be impacted but supply won't. If domestic markets slowdown, the international markets are strong and those options are available for Indian steel producers.""

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after the March earnings:

Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Raised to Rs 1,630 from Rs 1,000

The brokerage sees the current steel cycle remaining higher for longer. The company needs to have disciplined capital allocation & a strong focus on de-leveraging. The structural repair of balancesheet will improve its resilience in any downcycle.

Citi | Rating: Buy | Target: Raised to Rs 1,375 from Rs 1,200

There was a resilient demand in both China & overseas. The steel prices will likely go higher for longer. Citi raised the FY22-23 EBIDTA estimate by 13%/12%.

Jefferies | Rating: Buy | Target: Raised to Rs 1,500 from Rs 1,150

Broking house upgrades FY22-23 EBITDA estimates by 28-48% & EPS by 51-81%. The stock continues to trade at a reasonable valuation.

JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Raised to Rs 1,425 from Rs 1,250

There was a positive commentary on prices, margins, capex & debt. The brokerage increased FY22E/23 adjusted EBITDA by 28%/5%. It is a case for re-rating with net debt by FY23 should be nearly half of FY21.

Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities

The strong uptrend wave after breakout clearly indicates that bulls are in full control and may take Tata Steel to Rs 1230 level.

On the daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed a breakout continuation formation which is grossly positive but, intraday charts, and the momentum indicators indicate the stock is in an overbought zone and high chances of quick a short-term price correction cannot be ruled out if stock trading below Rs 1035.

For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1035 should be the trend decider level for the swing traders. If it sustains above the said levels, we can expect a continuation of the uptrend up to Rs 1200-1230.

At 09:23 hrs, Tata Steel was quoting at Rs 1,131.25, up Rs 30.70, or 2.79 percent on the BSE.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after the March earnings:

Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 1,000

Consolidated EBITDA was in line as India performed better than expectations but Europe missed estimates.

The cash flow was robust and the dividend payout is one of the highest in the last few years.

Investec | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,175

The best is ahead as it’s a preferred ferrous proxy. The operational beat was across regions. The strong CF generation aids balance sheet deleveraging.

Macquarie | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 1,045

It was a solid quarter with a constructive outlook. The earnings outlook particularly for EU contract will be key to watch. While, domestic demand outlook, expansion capex & timelines will be the key.

CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,150

The Q4 consolidated EBITDA was 11% above estimate, while debt reduction remained strong. Most businesses performed better than estimates. It reported the best-ever standalone profitability & Q1 likely to be even stronger.

Europe business was largely in line, while clarity is awaited on several issues. The deleveraging is on track with the focus now shifting to expansion projects.

Jefferies | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,125

The Q4 adjusted EBITDA rose 68% QoQ & 18% above our estimate. The rising steel prices drove sequentially higher EBITDA across businesses.

The recurring net profit rose 95% QoQ & 31% above our estimate. It generated a free cash flow of Rs 8,800 crore in Q4 with net debt fell by Rs 90 per share.

JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 1,250

The company reported a massive beat in Q4 with consolidated EBITDA at Rs 14,180 crore versus the consensus of Rs 12,800 crore.

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Neutral

Tata Steel Europe posted an EBITDA of Rs 11.9 billion (versus estimated Rs 31.3 billion) as against a loss of Rs 7.2 billion in Q3 FY21. EBITDA/t stood at USD 66/t (versus estimated USD170/t).

The miss on EBITDA was led by a miss on realization as only one-fourth of the QoQ increase in EU steel prices was reflected in TSE. This was due to contracts fixed earlier at lower prices

Indian steel major Tata Steel has filed a commercial court claim in the UK against British Indian steel tycoon Sanjeev Gupta led GFG Alliance, which owns Liberty Steel, over alleged missed payments from an acquisition dating back to 2017.

Liberty Steel had stepped in to acquire Tata’s Speciality Steels business employing more than 1,700 people in Yorkshire, Lancashire and the West Midlands in an estimated 100 million pounds deal, which Tata Steel announced as complete in May 2017.

Now, it has emerged that payments have been missed in that transaction resulting in Tata launching proceedings against Liberty Speciality Steels, Liberty House Group PTE and Speciality Steel UK – all parts of GFG Alliance, ‘The Daily Telegraph’ first reported.

“As this is now an active case we are not making any comment,” a Tata Steel spokesperson said on Thursday.

GFG Alliance, already under considerable pressure as it finds a way out of a financial crisis triggered by the collapse of its main backer Greensill Capital, declined to comment on the lawsuit but issued an update on its ongoing refinancing efforts.

“While most of our major businesses are performing well, some of our businesses in the UK have suffered as a result of COVID-19 and the collapse of Greensill Capital has meant there is less working capital support for our UK businesses while we seek new financing to replace Greensill,” a GFG Alliance spokesperson said.

“While that takes place, we are undertaking significant self-help measures with the support of our customers and suppliers to ensure we manage cash carefully and continue to operate. We continue constructive discussions with a range of stakeholders on mechanisms that would provide the short term working capital support our UK businesses need in order to protect jobs and the supply chain while refinancing takes place,” the spokesperson said.

The UK government has said that it continues to engage with the company and trade unions in search of solutions to save thousands of jobs.

In his most recent set of broadcast interviews earlier this month, Gupta had promised there would be no plant closures “under my watch” and addressed the thousands of steelworkers employed by his company to say that they are like his family and he will not give up on them.

The steel tycoon had widely been hailed as a saviour of British steel a few years ago, when Liberty Steel acquired a flurry of struggling UK plants, including parts of Caparo Industries when NRI industrialist Lord Swraj Paul’s UK units went into administration in 2015.

Greensill Capital, mired in controversy since it filed for insolvency last month, was the main funder for this acquisition spree and provided billions of pounds of support using controversial supply chain financing. Credit Suisse, a major investor in Greensill, has also launched winding-up petitions in court against GFG companies as it tries to guard against potential losses.

Liberty had claimed an initial GBP 20-million investment programme to boost output by repairing and upgrading mothballed machinery, adding new equipment and generating a total of 300 new jobs soon after it acquired Tata’s Speciality Steels business four years ago.

“Speciality Steels is an operation of the highest international calibre with highly-skilled people. We’re investing to ensure this business can capitalise on growing opportunities and reclaim its leading position in the market,” Gupta said at the time.",566,-0.29023296965493095

Tata Steel on Wednesday said it has received a ""blockchain-enabled transaction"", a global first for the steel industry, from a UAE-based firm for a steel export order.

However, the steel maker did not disclose the size of the transaction.

""Tata Steel and HSBC successfully executed a blockchain enabled transaction, a global first for the steel industry. This transaction was executed on Contour''s blockchain platform,"" a statement said.

The live trade finance transaction involved the export of steel by Tata Steel, India to Universal Tube & Plastic Industries, UAE, the statement added.

""This unique initiative, executed in collaboration with HSBC, demonstrates our continued efforts to lead technology-led disruptions by challenging the status quo and reimagining the global trade set-up,"" said Peeyush Gupta, Vice President (Steel Marketing & Sales), Tata Steel.

Explaining the concept of a blockchain transaction, Tata Steel said this technology in trade finance enables comprehensive visibility for all involved parties and enhances security in payment. It helps reduce the document negotiation and banking transaction cycle from week(s) to a few days.

It also shortens the transaction time of Letter-of-Credit (LC) transactions by allowing electronic transfer of title documents and connecting all parties allowing instantaneous updates.

""Having pioneered the deployment of blockchain technology in trade finance, we are focused on enhancing its utilisation across a wider spectrum of trade finance transactions.

""This transaction is a significant step towards the mass commercialisation and adoption of this technology and we look forward to its transformative impact on trade finance,"" said Hitendra Dave, Head-Global Banking & Markets, HSBC India.

Tata Steel further said UAE is India''s third largest trade partner. While the physical transfer of goods between India and UAE takes a relatively short time, the administrative paperwork can delay their delivery.

Reduced transaction time will help boost the efficiency of trade in the India-UAE corridor that is characterised by many close-proximity shipping routes, it said.",328,0.687568017414638

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Nearly a year after Tata Steel made a bitter exit from the Indian Steel Association (ISA), and its MD & Global CEO TV Narendran stepped down as the industry body’s president, there has been a reconciliation of sorts.

In an announcement on April 8, the ISA said that Tata Steel and its two units -- Tata Steel BSL Ltd and Tata Steel Long Products – have 're-entered' its fold. Bhushan Power & Steel, which was recently acquired by JSW Steel, has also become a member of the ISA.

The official announcement didn't give any reason to the change in Tata Steel's stance. The present ISA president Dilip Oommen, also the CEO of ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, said that the association is “pleased” that the members are “back with us”.

“This association, over the years, has played a pivotal role in addressing and resolving critical issues that impact our industry, and we are confident of building our collective voice and going from strength to strength,” he said.

It was a critical issue and it was the difference of opinion over it that prompted Narendran to step down last year, just a few months before he completed his tenure. It was probably the first time in the history of the association that a sitting president was stepping down.

It had all boiled down to one question: What should be the association’s response to the government’s plan to advance the termination of captive mine leases to 2025 from 2030?

Tata Steel was against advancing the termination. On the other hand, the rest of the members, including JSW Steel, were for it, sources had told Moneycontrol. Public sector company, SAIL, is also part of the ISA.

So, does it mean that all members, including Tata Steel and JSW Steel, now agree on the mines issue? May not be.

Friends in good times

It is not yet clear who has had a change in mind, Tata Steel, or the rest of its peers in the industry. In fact, all of them coming together may not be about the mines issue at all. “It may even be out of the purview of ISA,” said a senior executive from the industry.

Instead, it is the good times that has brought unity back in the industry.

Nearly all steelmakers have benefited from the increase in demand, and subsequent price hikes. Most of them have also reported better, or record, production and sales numbers in the just concluded fourth quarter of the last financial year. Stocks of JSW Steel, Tata Steel and SAIL have repeatedly hit 52-week highs in the last fortnight.

There is room for more hikes, and this will further help steel companies recover losses from last year's lockdown, and improve margins. Most importantly, all have debts to repay.

But the price hikes, which have continued since June 2020, has also evoked protest and criticism from the user industry. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has been vocal about it and alleged that the industry has created a cartel. Subsequently, the Competition Commission of India began a probe too.

It is, perhaps, to face this probe and criticism that the steel industry has come together now. “Tata Steel joining the ISA will benefit both, as all have to be united. There is pressure from clients and government,” said an official from the industry who has been following the developments.

That is not all. The government, too, another source from the industry said, had wanted everyone to come together, and the Ministry of Steel pushed for Tata Steel to come back. “Dilip Oommen too played a role,” said one of the executives quoted above.

So, does it mean that it’s all peaceful again in the steel industry? “They will stay together as long as there is no deep conflict,” said the executive. The bonhomie will be tested when the mines issue comes up again on the table.

Tata Steel share price gained over 2 percent on April 7 after the company achieved its highest-ever quarterly crude steel production of 4.75 million tonnes.

The steel major achieved its highest-ever quarterly crude steel production of 4.75 million tonnes with a 3 percent QoQ growth in Q4FY21. Full-year FY21 production was lower by 7 percent YoY primarily due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 1HFY21, said the company in its BSE filing.

During the quarter, steel production at Tata Steel Europe increased to 2.65 million tonnes and steel sales volume rose by 18 percent QoQ and 4 percent YoY, it added.

Tata Steel price movement since last 6 months

The stock was trading at Rs 881.95, up Rs 19.10, or 2.21 percent. It has touched a 52-week high of Rs 882.30. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 882.30 and an intraday low of Rs 863.00.

The stock price has surged over 132 percent in the last six months with the company's market capitalisation breaching the Rs 1 lakh crore mark at Rs 1,04,868.95 crore at 09:31 hours.

S&P Global Ratings has upgraded its long-term rating on the company to BB- from B+ and maintained the outlook at stable, according to a Mint report.

It said the rating upgrade was because the company was on track to slash part of its $15 billion debt in the next two years helped by higher realisations and strong cash flows.

Moody’s Investors Service said it has changed its outlook for Tata Steel Ltd to stable from negative. Its profitability has steadily improved to its 10-year high of Rs 18,948 EBITDA/tonne during the third quarter of FY21, from Rs 4,969 in the first quarter, PTI reported.

Moody’s forecasts a long-term sustainable EBITDA/tonne of Rs 13,200 for fiscal 2022 for TSI, constituting a 30 percent gap compared to the December quarter.

Moody’s Investors Service on Thursday said it has changed its outlook for Tata Steel Ltd to stable from negative.

Tata Steel is one of the country’s top steel producers with an installed capacity of 20.6 million tonne per annum (MTPA).

The rating agency said it ""has changed the outlook on Tata Steel Ltd to stable from negative.""

India’s steel consumption declined by 55 percent during the first quarter of fiscal 2020-21 following the nationwide lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, it added.

However, since the opening up of the economy in June 2020, pent-up demand from end-user industries, particularly from sectors like automotive, white goods manufacturing, construction and infrastructure have boosted steel consumption.

A benign industry environment, supportive government policies in the form of large infrastructure investments and markedly better prospects in the automotive industry have supported steel prices in India, the agency said.

These conditions, Moody’s said, have propelled TSI’s record profitability in recent quarters.

Its profitability has steadily improved to its 10-year high of Rs 18,948 EBITDA/tonne during the third quarter of FY21, from Rs 4,969 in the first quarter.

Moody’s forecasts a long-term sustainable EBITDA/tonne of Rs 13,200 for fiscal 2022 for TSI, constituting a 30 percent gap compared to the December quarter.

The company, therefore, has a substantial buffer especially given the benign operating environment.

Moreover, the company’s backward linkages with entire iron ore needs met from captive sources provide resilience to profitability even if steel prices were to severely fall.

For the company’s business in Europe, Moody’s said, shipments at Tata Steel’s European operations (TSE) will decline by about 10 percent during fiscal 2021.

Europe’s economic activity was affected by further lockdowns and a seasonally weak winter quarter, although it has improved since the early months of the pandemic, the agency noted.

Moody’s Vice President and Senior Credit Officer Kaustubh Chaubal said, ""The rating affirmation and outlook change to stable are driven by a solid recovery in Tata Steel’s operations in the third quarter of the fiscal year ending March 2021. We believe the company will sustain the improvement over the next 12-18 months”.

The rating action also reflects the company’s proactive financial management amid the pandemic and its publicly stated target of reducing gross debt by at least $1 billion each year and prioritising deleveraging over capital expenditure, he added.",397,0.26740689002550566

On the day it overtook Tata Steel as the largest steelmaker in India, JSW Steel also took the competition to its nearest rival.

On March 26, the Sajjan Jindal-led company submitted an Expression of Interest (EoI) for Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited, the public sector steelmaker in Odisha's Kalinga Nagar, which is less than 10 minutes drive from Tata Steel's unit.

JSW Steel joins Tata Steel and ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India in the race for Neelachal. A Business Standard report said that the Vedanta-owned ESL Steel is also interested in the facility.

JSW Steel declined to comment for the story.

""JSW Steel is keen on all downstream assets that are on the block. Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd seem to have been just the starting point,"" a senior executive from the industry said.

On March 26, JSW Steel completed the acquisition of Bhushan Power and Steel, adding 2.5 million tons to its capacity and making it the largest steelmaker in the country with the ability to churn 20.5 million tons of steel annually. Its lead over Tata Steel is slim whose capacity is at 20 million tons a year.

With Neelachal, JSW Steel can either consolidate its lead or Tata Steel can again take the crown. Of course, others in the race can play spoilsport.

The last day for submitting EoIs for Neelachal is March 29. Neelachal is co-owned by public sector units of central and state government, including MMTC Ltd and Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation of Orissa limited (IPICOL). Neelachal has an annual capacity to produce 1.1 million tons of long steel, which is used in construction.

In its first avatar, Tata Steel's e-commerce platform Aashiyana ensured customers could buy a steel bar as conveniently as they buy phones online, with the click of a button.

This has helped Aashiyana to already surpass its pre-COVID-19 performance, with orders now coming from customers not just in India, but also from NRIs in South-East Asia, Middle-East and the US.

Now in Aashiyana 2.0, the platform allows customers, who are typically those who are building houses, to buy products from the stables of other Tata Group companies.

""Aashiyana is about home building. Now as you build a house, you need an air conditioner, a DTH connection, insurance, and other household items. These are home making products that are made by other Tata companies, with whom we are collaborating under Aashiyana 2.0,"" Peeyush Gupta, Vice President, Marking & Sales, Tata Steel, told Moneycontrol.

This means that as a customer browses Aashiyana for different steel products, such as bars, wires and doors, he or she will come across Tata Basera, which houses various Tata brands under one umbrella. For loan there is Tata Capital, ACs from Voltas, electronic products from Croma, DTH connection from Tata Sky and insurance from Tata AIG.

These non-steel products will be showcased offline too, in retail shops run by Tata Steel dealers.

This digital synergy between Tata Steel and its peers in the salt to software conglomerate aligns with the vision that Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran had shared earlier in 2021.

“When you look at trends for the future, definitely there are clear signs you can pick up. Anything that is digital, we’re making a big bet on,” Chandrasekaran had said during a Reuters Next conference in January.

The digital push makes sense when one also looks at the government's 'Housing for All' program, under which 3 million houses need to be built every year. Half of this will be in tier 2, 3 and 4 cities and towns where people prefer to build houses on a plot of land.

The execution will bank on the supply chain Tata Steel has created in the last 16 years.

Riding the pandemic

Tata Steel had first ventured into retailing in 2005, with the launch of steeljunction, claimed to be India's first organised steel retail store. ""Aashiyana wouldn't have happened without the foundation that had been laid in 2005,"" says Gupta.

Over the last 16 years, the retail venture has created a network of over 55 distributors and more than 5,000 dealers that now reach 650 of the country's 718 districts, and 20,000 of the over 27,000 pincodes across India. Backing this network is the warehouse infrastructure. Tata Steel itself has 27 warehouses around the country, apart from the ones that its distributors have.

""For instance, in Uttar Pradesh we have a warehouse in Kanpur. Our distributors too have a warehouse in Kanpur, and also in Varanasi, Prayagraj and Agra,"" said Gupta. This network has ensured the company promises delivery within 72 hours. ""Till now we have a 95 percent accuracy,"" added the senior executive.

With Aashiyana, the customer could not only order a steel product by piece and not weight - Gupta claims Tata Steel is the only player in the country who enables this, he or she can use a credit card to make the transaction. Also, the virtual platform has a network of architects, designers and contractors from whom a customer can choose to build the house.

Peeyush Gupta, Vice President, Marketing & Sales, Tata Steel

The model especially came handy during COVID-19, which brought economic activity, including construction, to a standstill. ""We told customers that we will hold back their order and will deliver after lockdown. Price will remain the same. And if they want to cancel, they could,"" said Gupta.

While this ensured that the inventory moved after lockdown was lifted, Tata Steel asked its dealers also to start keeping some stock. This especially helped as some warehouses and dealers came in 'red zones,' but customers could still be serviced from outlets in the 'green zones.'

""Also, as work from home became normal and people started going back to native places, there was a need for that additional room, and we saw more people ordering online. Also, NRI started ordering from our portal for their parents. These are customers who would have never come to our offline stores,"" says Gupta.

The push helped Tata Aashiyana surpass its pre-COVID-19 numbers by February 2021, when it had a monthly turnover of Rs 100 crore. A year earlier, it had done Rs 75 crore in February 2020. ""We had a turnover of Rs 320 crore in FY20, and expect to cross Rs 700 crore in this financial year. We plan to achieve a turnover of over Rs 1, 200 crore in the next financial year, with a monthly run rate of Rs 100 crore,"" added the senior Tata Steel executive.

Gupta and his team have already laid a vision that takes forward Aashiyana 2.0. ""We want to bring in products, even those not produced by any Tata company, that will add value to our customers,"" said Gupta. These products could include cement and tiles that are commonly in demand from customers building a house.",893,0.9726796299219131

With its latest move to acquire Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd (BPSL), the Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel may end fiscal year 2021 as the largest steelmaker in India.

The acquisition is also a fresh assault on Tata Steel's numero uno position. The two steelmakers have been involved in an intense race over the last few years, with both aggressively bidding for bankrupt firms that landed up in insolvency courts.

Last week, BPSL’s lenders voted to accept JSW Steel's offer to deposit Rs 19,350 crore in an escrow account and complete the acquisition by the end of March. Though JSW Steel had received the National Company Law Tribunal’s green light for the BPSL takeover in 2019, an investigation by the Enforcement Directorate had delayed the eventual handover.

The ED is investigating money laundering charges against BPSL's former promoters, and in the process attached company assets worth over Rs 4,000 crore. JSW Steel has sought immunity from the probe. Also, it has said that if the Supreme Court votes against its ongoing petition for immunity, the lenders will have to return the Rs 19,350 crore. The banks have now agreed to the condition.

For JSW Steel, the timing of the acquisition could not be better as commodity prices continue to their upward trek, not to speak of the opportunity to go one up against Tata Steel. But, as industry observers point out, apart from the BPSL acquisition, JSW Steel’s own organic expansion will add to its numbers.

How the numbers stack up

One thing is clear. Tata Steel is by far the biggest Indian steelmaker, with a global capacity of 33 million tonnes a year. About 13 million tonnes of that come from its overseas operations, mostly in Europe. The rest, about 20 million tonnes of capacity in India, is just enough to make it the biggest steel producer in the country.

In the second place is not JSW Steel but state-owned SAIL, with a capacity of 19.63 million tonnes a year. JSW Steel is third, with an annual steel-making capacity of 18 million tonnes.

But that will change, possibly in the remaining days of the current fiscal year, and majorly in the next. “While the BPSL acquisition will add 3 million tonnes of capacity, JSW Steel has other organic expansions that will bring in more numbers,” said a senior executive from the industry.

A majority of that expansion will be at its Dolvi, Maharashtra-based unit, which is doubling capacity to 10 million tonnes. There is also the one million tonnes that will come from Monnet Ispat, another insolvent company that was picked by JSW Steel.

In total, JSW Steel will have a capacity of 27 million tonnes a year in the 2022 financial year.

Now, here is the interesting part; both, Tata Steel and JSW Steel, have ambitious expansion plans. While Tata Steel wants to double its production capacity to 40 million tonnes, JSW Steel has an eye on the 50 million tonne-mark.

If one goes by the number of steel companies that are on the block, the fierce rivals will be sure to continue their acquisition sprees as well.",529,0.43405480682849884

Tata Power Ltd on Wednesday said its arm TP Saurya will provide solar power to Tata Steel Ltd at Jamshedpur, Jharkhand.

Tata Power's wholly-owned subsidiary, TP Saurya Limited, has signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Tata Steel Ltd to develop a 15 MW solar project at Jamshedpur, Jharkhand, a company statement said.

The energy will be supplied to Tata Steel Ltd under a PPA valid for a period of 25 years from scheduled commercial operation date.

The project is required to be commissioned within six months from the date of execution of the PPA, the company said.

The Plant is expected to generate an average of 32 MUs (Million units) of energy per year and will annually offset approximately an average 25.8 Million Kg of CO2.

Tata Power's renewable capacity will increase to 4,047 MW, out of which 2,687 MW is operational and 1,360 MW is under implementation including 15 MW won under this PPA.

After the setback of Sweden's SSAB pulling out of talks to buy the Dutch units, Tata Steel is now focusing on improving cash flows of its European operations.

The Indian steelmaker will continue with the process to separate the Dutch and UK units of its European operations, the company said after announcing financial results for the third quarter ending December 31, 2020.

""Following the termination of the discussions with SSAB on Tata Steel Netherland (TSN), the company will be focusing on performance and cash flows in the immediate term,"" the company said in a statement on February 9.

""Tata Steel is committed to arrive at a strategic and sustainable resolution for its European portfolio. Tata Steel’s IJmuiden plant is among the most environmentally efficient and cost competitive steel producers in Europe. The process to separate Tata Steel Netherlands and Tata Steel UK is currently underway,"" it added.

On January 29, SSAB announced the termination of the talks which were made formal in November. ""We cannot align Tata Steel Ijmuiden with our sustainability strategy in the way desired,” Martin Lindqvist, President and CEO at SSAB, had said.

Subsequently, industry observers had told Moneycontrol that the Indian company will now be forced to look outside of Europe to get a buyer. ""It is a setback for Tata Steel. They have been looking for a solution for their European business. But now with two failed attempts, their scope for a good solution is narrowing,"" said a senior executive from the European steel industry.

The financial burden

That Tata Steel will need to re-focus investments into Tata Steel Europe was evident from the third quarter results.

The Indian operations reported better-than-expected numbers, with the highest ever quarterly EBITDA of Rs 8,811 crore, more than doubling from the same quarter in the corresponding year. On the other hand, Tata Steel Europe posted loss of of Rs 724.27 crore at EBITDA level in Q3FY21 against Rs 956.30 crore in Q3FY20.

Tata Steel Europe reported a 1.8 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 14,069.92 crore, but at EBITDA level, it posted loss of Rs 724.27 crore in Q3FY21 against Rs 956.30 crore in Q3FY20.

At the operating level, its consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) surged 160.7 percent to Rs 9,540 crore and margin expanded by 1,380 bps to 24.1 percent compared to corresponding period, with improved realisation across key entities.

""Consolidated free cash flow was Rs 12,078 crore during Q3FY21 and Rs 20,588 crore in the first nine months of the current financial year driven by strong operating performance, disciplined capital expenditure and working capital management,"" Tata Steel in its BSE filing.

The company continues to prioritise on capital expenditure. Tata Steel spent Rs 1,394 crore on capex during the December quarter.

The company also said it has decided to restart work on pellet plant and cold roll mill complex at Tata Steel Kalinganagar. Both the Pellet plant and Cold Roll Mill complex, once completed, will expand margin, it believes.

As a part of its enterprise deleveraging plan, Tata Steel said it had completed reduction of net debt by Rs 18,609 crore in the first nine months of the current financial year 2020-21.

During the third quarter, the company reduced the leverage by Rs 10,325 crore, it added. ""As part of the continued de-leveraging strategy further deleveraging is being undertaken in Q4FY21.""

As far as India operations are concerned, crude steel production remained strong at 4.60 million tonnes, registering a 3 percent YoY growth in Q3FY21, while domestic deliveries grew 4 percent YoY to 4.16 million tonnes and exports shrank below 11 percent of overall deliveries, said the company, adding sales witnessed strong momentum but was constrained by lower opening inventory.

India operations (which includes Tata Steel Standalone, Tata Steel BSL and Tata Steel Long Products on proforma basis) achieved the highest ever quarterly EBITDA of Rs 8,811 crore with 2.14 times YoY growth, driven by higher prices, better product mix, lower exports and operating efficiency initiatives, said the company. ""This translates into an EBITDA per ton of Rs 18,931 and an EBITDA margin of 34.9 percent.

The company further said Tata Steel standalone achieved the highest ever quarterly EBITDA Rs 6,737 crore, registering a 78 percent YoY growth. This translates into an EBITDA per ton of Rs 20,175 and an EBITDA margin of 37.5 percent, it added.",589,0.8333988239367803

Tata Steel is expected to report strong profit, on February 9, in the range of Rs 3,000-4,000 crore for the quarter ended December 2020 driven by its operating performance. The company had reported loss of Rs 1,166 crore in the corresponding period of last fiscal.

Revenue from operations may grow around 12-13 percent while the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) could see a significant jump on account of higher realisation.

""We estimate steel realization to increase 17 percent YoY due to lower exports and higher prices in the domestic market on improved domestic demand. India EBITDA per tonne may increase by 97 percent YoY due to higher realizations, but we expect volumes to decline by 3 percent YoY at 3.3 million tonnes during Q3FY21 due to lower operational days in the quarter,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees profit at Rs 4,153 crore on revenue growth of 12.3 percent YoY.

Kotak estimates Europe EBITDA per tonne at $34 per tonne as higher steel spreads would be largely offset by higher iron ore prices and EBITDA at Bhushan Steel to increase 572 percent YoY due to higher steel prices. It estimates volumes to decline to 1.25 million tonnes.

Tata Steel may be forced to look outside Europe for a buyer of its Dutch facilities after Sweden's SSAB pulled away from a possible deal. It's going to be a tough task, say, industry observers, with the Indian company's best bet being in the Russian steelmakers.

SSAB on January 29 announced that it was no longer keen to go forward with the deal to buy Tata Steel's Dutch units. The two sides had initiated the talks in November 2020.

""It is a setback for Tata Steel. They have been looking for a solution for their European business. But now with two failed attempts, their scope for a good solution is narrowing,"" said a senior executive from the European steel industry.

Before SSAB, it was in talks with Germany's Thyssenkrupp to form a joint venture. The European Commission had blocked the proposed joint venture, saying it will hurt competition in some of the key segments of the steel sector in Europe. The commission had identified three industry segments - automotive steel, coated steel used for packaging, and electrical steel - where the JV may harm competition.

Hopes of a successful talk were higher with SSAB, especially with no possible hurdle at the Commission. But the Swedish company said the acquisition didn't meet SSAB's overall vision for a fossil-free production. Europe has been pushing steelmakers to reduce their carbon footprint.

“The synergies that we saw in the transaction would not fully justify the costs and investments required for our desired transformation. This means that overall, the transaction would not meet our financial expectations,” Martin Lindqvist, President, and CEO at SSAB said. The group’s goal is to be the first in the world to supply fossil-free steel by 2026 and to be a fossil-free company by 2045.

The dual impact

The twin failures pull back Tata Steel on multiple fronts.

""Engaging with a company is a time-taking, and resource-burning exercise,"" said an industry executive who has held senior-level positions at steel companies in India. ""A lot of due diligence takes place, people are involved. And through these times, clients, vendors, and customers are also on tenterhooks as they also wait for an outcome,"" the executive added.

Tata Steel's talks with Thyssenkrupp had last for over a year before it ended in May 2019. It took another year and a half's search for the Indian company to formally announce its engagement with SSAB. This has now lasted over two months.

Also, the valuation of the Dutch assets will be hit. ""The unit continues to be one of Europe's best run and most profitable units. But given the reservations raised by SSAB, this will hamper future talks, "" said the first executive quoted above.

Carbon emissions have been a much-discussed subject in Europe, with government efforts to reduce pollution getting popular support. Tata Steel would be forced to spend more to reduce the carbon footprint of its units in the UK and the Netherlands. A sale of the Dutch units will not just save it money, but also provide enough funds to clear off the debts, of 1.7 billion Euros, on the books of Tata Steel Europe.

Industry observers reckoned the company would have netted up to $3 billion from the sale of Dutch units.

Tata Steel has tried to downplay the setback. "" Currently, around two-thirds of the business of Tata Steel is based in India with best in class, highly cost-competitive assets, and strong cash flows and Tata Steel remains committed to undertaking significant de-leveraging in FY21 and beyond,"" the company had said.

But the one-third of the business continues to be a thorn in the flesh, and investors will be concerned. The company's stock had dived over three percent after the SSAB announcement.

Who now?

Will ArcelorMittal be interested to buy the Dutch asset? Even if the world's, and Europe's, largest steelmaker is, it's unlikely to pass muster with the Commission. Just like in the case of Thyssenkrupp.

Liberty Steel, owned by Sanjeev Gupta, had been vocal about its interest in Tata Steel's UK units. But Liberty's focus is now on making a deal with Thyssenkrupp.

Who else? Brazil's CSN, which had dueled with Tata Steel for Corus - which was later rechristened Tata Steel Europe - doesn't seem to be any more interested in Europe as a manufacturing base.

That leaves Russian steel companies. There are a few - Severstal and NLMK, to name a few. Severstal, whoever is not interested in participating in the consolidation of the European steel industry, which has struggled against Chinese imports.

Will NLMK, which already has units in France, Italy, and Belgium, play ball with Tata Steel?",787,-0.5481073194079928

In a setback to Tata Steel, its deal to sell Dutch unit to Sweden's SSAB may have come unstuck.

“We have carefully evaluated Tata Steel IJmuiden and have concluded that an acquisition would be difficult for technical reasons. We cannot be sufficiently certain that we could implement our industrial plan with the preferred technical solutions as quickly as we would wish. We cannot align Tata Steel Ijmuiden with our sustainability strategy in the way desired,” says Martin Lindqvist, President and CEO at SSAB, said in a statement on January 29.

It was in November that Tata Steel had confirmed the talks to sell the unit, based in Ijmuiden in the Netherlands. This was a fresh attempt from India's largest steelmaker to find a solution to its troubles in Europe, more than a year after a merger with Germany's thyssenkrupp was blocked by European Commission.

Apart from the Dutch unit, Tata Steel's European operations include the facility in the UK. The company was hoping to sell the Dutch unit, among the most profitable steelmaking sites in Europe, to also turnaround the UK operations.

The company's stock dived by over 3 percent at the Bombay Stock Exchange, as the new trickled in. It was down 3.2 percent at the time of writing.

Investors would be worried about the failure to seal the deal, and what the company now does with the 1.7 billion Euros of debt on Tata Steel Europe's books. Proceeds from the sale will be used to lower the debt on the company's books.

The Netherlands unit has an annual capacity of 7.5 million tonne and has 10,000 employees.

Responding to the development later in the day, Tata Steel said:

""Tata Steel confirms that SSAB has withdrawn its initial interest for Tata Steel Netherland business. However, Tata Steel wishes to confirm that it is committed to arriving at a strategic resolution for its European portfolio.

""Tata Steel’s IJmuiden plant is among the most environmentally efficient and cost competitive steel producers in Europe. Currently, around two third of the business of Tata Steel is based in India with best in class, highly cost competitive assets and strong cash flows and Tata Steel remains committed to undertake significant de-leveraging in FY21 and beyond.""

What SSAB said

""After deeper analysis and discussions, it became clear that there were limited possibilities to integrate IJmuiden into the SSAB strategic framework. Discussions with Tata Steel have therefore concluded,"" the company said.

Lindqvist further noted that the acquisition didn't meet SSAB's overall vision for a fossil-free production. Europe has been pushing steelmakers to reduce their carbon footprint.

“The synergies that we saw in the transaction would not fully justify the costs and investments required for our desired transformation. This means that overall, the transaction would not meet our financial expectations,” he said.

The group’s goal is to be the first in the world, in 2026, to supply fossil-free steel to market and to be a fossil-free company by 2045.

Though India is still in nascent stages as far as Carbon Capture is concerned, some companies are already using this technology in their industrial units.

What is Carbon Capture?

It is the process through which carbon dioxide is captured from large emission sources, thereby recycling it for other purposes and reducing emissions. According to experts, Carbon Capture is not new technology, but it got attention recently owing to the renewed focus on climate change.

What is the use of this process in India?

In India, state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) tied up with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in 2019 to use carbon dioxide captured from Koyali refinery in Gujarat for enhanced oil recovery (EoR) in ONGC fields. Injecting carbon dioxide for EoR is a widely-used technology by oil and gas companies globally. EoR is used in those oil fields which are in their final stages of production and production is difficult through normal means. NALCO too at its Angul facility is doing carbon sequestration through micro-algae cultivation. In September 2020, Tata Steel and Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) had signed a deal to collaborate in the area of Carbon Capture, Utilisation & Storage (CCUS).

""Carbon Capture technology is used for a while in India too. However, the major issue with this is that it is not economically viable. The cost of Carbon Capture runs into $500-600 a tonne, making it less attractive for industrial players,"" said Priyavrat Bhati, Sector Head in Climate, Environment, and Sustainability at the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP).

How renewable sources may kill Carbon Capture

According to experts, another reason why Carbon Capture did not gather momentum is because of the rise in renewable energy.

""The technology was suited for coal-fired power plants and steel plants for a country like India, that is heavily dependent on coal. However, with the country's new renewable ambitions, the idea that it is better to reduce emissions completely by shifting to renewables strengthened, rather than opting for costly Carbon Capture,"" Bhati added.",376,-0.3094206651051839

Several Indian companies are making plans to buy COVID-19 vaccines for their employees, just days after the country's government began one of the world's largest vaccination drives with healthcare and other frontline workers.

Steel producer Jindal Steel and Power Ltd, autos-to technology conglomerate Mahindra Group and consumer goods giant ITC Ltd have begun initial checks on hopes that vaccines will be available for purchase after the government covers priority segments.

""ITC would certainly like to extend the vaccination to employees... We have approached vaccine manufactures and are in exploratory talks,"" Amitav Mukherji, head of corporate human resources, said.

India is currently using Britain's Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being produced in India by the Serum Institute, and a government-backed alternative developed by India's Bharat Biotech.

Tata Steel said it would get employees inoculated as soon as shots are available commercially.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Indian factories are recovering from one of the world's strictest lockdown last year, which led to large-scale job losses and migration of workers back to their villages.

""We are reaching out to vaccine manufacturers for bulk supply of doses and will try to get these doses after completion of all frontline Covid warriors' vaccination,"" Pankaj Lochan, chief human resource officer, JSPL, said.

The company did not give more details on either the number of doses it plans to buy or with whom it was in talks with.

The world's second-most populous country, India trails only the United States in numbers of COVID-19 infections.

Billionaire Anand Mahindra-led Mahindra Group said it was also interested in buying vaccines for employees ""in accordance with the priorities and sequence to be specified by the government"".

Global consumer goods giant Unilever last week said it was strongly encouraging employees to get vaccinated as soon as possible and floated the idea that it could buy shots to share with people in poorer countries.

As governments rush to inoculate the most vulnerable, however, most corporations globally have so far been quiet on whether they would seek to secure early supplies for employees.

Tata Main Hospital in Jamshedpur will kick off the vaccination roll out on January 16, by giving doses to health professionals. Eventually, 3,000 of health professionals will be vaccinated.

Run by Tata Steel, the TMH in Jamshedpur has been the largest COVID care facility in Jharkhand, with over 1,000 beds dedicated for the purpose. As on date, TMH is one of the designated hospitals for conducting COVID vaccine trials.

""We will continue to work with the Govt and as and when further vaccines are made available, we would vaccinate our employees as per the guidelines,"" a Tata Steel spokesperson said on January 15.

Overall, reports add, about 8,000 health professionals will be given the jabs in the first phase of vaccination in the state. About 16,200 doses of the vaccine arrived on January 13.

Companies across sectors are beginning to make plans to vaccinate employees. Manufacturing companies seem to be leading the way, as few of their employees have the comfort of working from home, and thus are more vulnerable to catch the infection.

The JSW Group, for instance, has begun talks with vaccine makers to procure vaccines for its 25,000 employees and their families. Similarly, JSPL has also engaged with vaccine makers for buying doses.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of a new strain, Tata Steel is confident that there will be a rise in demand for steel in India in 2021.

""We believe that the steel demand in the country should grow at least at the rate of GDP growth or higher in FY22,” Narendran said.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel (TATA) has seen strong recovery in profitability, led by higher steel prices. Consolidated EBITDA rose 60% YoY to INR61.1b in 2QFY21 (the highest in the last six quarters), and we estimate 3QFY21 to be even stronger at INR71.6b (+98% YoY). Furthermore, net debt fell INR83b QoQ to INR988b (the lowest in the last six quarters), led by working capital release of INR103b. The potential divestment of the company’s profitable Netherlands operations to SSAB could lead to further deleveraging. However, its continually loss-making UK operations would remain an overhang on the stock. We raise our FY21/FY22E EBITDA estimates by 38%/9%, factoring in higher steel prices and spreads. Maintain Neutral.

Outlook

At CMP, the stock trades at 6.1x FY22E EV/EBITDA. Maintain Neutral, with TP of INR456/sh based on FY22E EV/EBITDA of 6x for Indian operations and 5x for Europe.

The UK unit of Tata Steel's European operations is under focus as the company has now engaged with Sweden's SSAB to sell the Dutch arm. On November 13, Tata Steel made official its talks with SSAB and said that it may take about six months to complete the process.

Both the UK and Dutch operations till now came under Tata Steel Europe. But now the two will be separated and the bigger and more profitable Dutch unit will be taken over by SSAB.

The Netherlands operations contribute about 70 percent of Tata Steel Europe business, and there have been concerns about the UK unit - which has struggled most historically - managing by itself.

The European operations come from Tata Steel's acquisition of Corus in 2006, a $13 billion-deal that the company has struggled to manage since then.

At the same time, the potential deal with SSAB will help the company partly or completely clear the debt of Euros 1.7 billion that Tata Steel Europe has. While the company has till now been mum on the deal value, industry observers put it at multi-billion dollars.

But will a standalone UK operations put a drain on its Indian parent?

Narendran doesn't think so.

""Last six months, Tata Steel Europe has been cash positive and neutral and hasn't got support from India. The UK operations are within sight of meeting the target of being self-sustainable,"" he said.

""The mandate,"" Narendran added, ""is to run without India's support.""

It will give confidence that the European market has recovered well, with demand for steel picking up, especially from the auto industry. Though the company's consolidated net profit in the second quarter fell by over a half year-on-year, it swung to profitability after three quarters of losses.

While the company will bank on improved performance in the coming quarters- despite a re-surge in COVID-19 cases in Europe - it needs a more permanent solution to high production costs in the UK, where power rates are higher than in other countries.",511,0.20391741820744105

Tata Steel Europe and South Korea’s POSCO will collaborate to develop steel tubes needed for high-speed hyperloop transportation systems, the companies said.

Richard Branson’s Virgin Hyperloop on Sunday completed the world’s first passenger ride on their levitating pod system, which it hopes will transform human and cargo transportation while slashing carbon emissions.

Tata Steel Europe, a unit of India’s Tata Steel, said in a joint statement with the world’s fifth biggest steelmaker POSCO that they would develop high-quality steel grades needed for the huge vacuum tubes that allow high-speed transport using very little energy.

“POSCO has been conducting hyperloop related research such as feasibility, design and structural optimisation of various types of steel tubes for more than 10 years,” said Duk-Lak Lee, head of technical research laboratories at POSCO.

The steel tubes not only need to allow a vehicle to travel in a low-pressure environment, where air is removed to cut resistance, but retain straightness over very long distances, the companies said.

They neither gave a time frame nor financial details for their hyperloop project.

In a hyperloop system, which uses magnetic levitation to allow near-silent travel, a trip between New York and Washington would take just 30 minutes. That would be twice as fast as a commercial jet flight and four times faster than a high-speed train.",228,

Derivatives & Quantitative Outlook

Metal stocks have been in a recovery mode and have showed significant resilience in the current market volatility. Stocks like JSW Steel have managed to retest their new 52 week high despite jittery market conditions, indicating the prevailing positive bias in the metal space. We believe stocks like Tata Steel will resume their uptrend on account of short covering. The open interest in the stock declined sharply in June amid short covering. Since September, the stock has witnessed a downtrend with short additions. These positions have begun to be covered. We now expect momentum to be seen along with covering of short positions in the coming sessions.

Tata Steel has recorded its highest-ever quarterly deliveries in the second quarter of FY20, signalling a continued pick-up in demand for steel.

While the numbers include those of its units - Tata Steel BSL and Tata Steel Long Products, the company underlined that it has ""ramped up its steelmaking and downstream operations back to pre-Covid level, with all major sites operating at around full capacity utilization.""

The country's leading steelmaker delivered 5.05 million tons of steel in the quarter, a jump of 72 percent QoQ, and 22 percent YoY.

With demand picking up in the domestic market, Tata Steel reduced its exports to 24 percent of its total deliveries, and sharply ramped up domestic deliveries to 3.86 million tons which translates to an increase of 164 percent QoQ and 10 percent YoY. Its production in second quarter increased by 54 percent QoQ, and 2 percent YoY, to 4.59 million tons.

The company noted that overall, steel consumption in India was down by 7.5 percent YoY, and production was down by 1.9 percent YoY.

Its peer JSW Steel also reported a jump in its crude steel production for the second quarter, and also in its capacity utilization. The company produced 3.85 million tons of steel in the quarter, slightly better than the 3.84 million tons in the same period last year. It was considerably higher, by 30 percent, quarter on quarter.

""With this the company has achieved average capacity utilisation of 86 percent in Q2 ’21 in line with pre Covid-19 level of 85 percent of last year Q2. This is a quantum jump from capacity utilisation of 66 percent for Q1 ’21, which was impacted by the pandemic,"" JSW Steel said in a statement.

Sectoral demand

This is what Tata Steel said about demand from some of the sectors that consume much of the steel produced in the country:

Automotive & special products: segment deliveries grew 10 percent YoY with pick-up in sector demand especially in 2W and PV segment; we also gained Share of Business in the new PV and LCV launches

Branded products & retail segment deliveries grew by 5 percent YoY with deliveries to B2ECA sector growing by 9 percent YoY; Tata Shaktee achieved a delivery volume growth of 22 percent YoY with robust rural demand.

Industrial products & projects segment deliveries grew by 13 percent YoY. We achieved a 31 percent YoY growth in value added product deliveries within the segment as we continued to focus on product mix enrichment by catering to discerning customers in segments such as Oil & Gas, Lifting and Excavation and Precision Tubes.

Extensive selling in the previous week pushed Nifty lower towards 200 DMA standing around 10,790 mark; however it managed to bounce back on Friday & close above crucial psychological levels of 11,000. At the same time, index has closed inside BB lower band after giving a bearish breakdown suggests the possibility of the reversal or pull back towards the middle band which is standing around 11,300.

The index is trading below 20 DMA (11,350) and 50 DMA (11,300) but for a deeper correction to occur 20 DMA needs to cross below 50 DMA. If that happens the downside target would be the 20-week SMA standing around 10,680.

Overall, Nifty can trade in a range of 20 DMA standing around 11,350 mark and 200 DMA placed near 10,800 levels for the coming week whereas strong movement on either side will decide directional action. But for the rally to resume, Nifty needs to close above 11,350 mark, till then sell on a higher level would be the right strategy. Also, in the very near term, rapid fall in the last week has put the majority of the oscillators in an oversold zone, so chances of bounce back to cool off the indicators is likely possible.

Bank Nifty too traded with a negative tone during the last week and closed below the majority of the moving averages indicating bearish bias to continue further. As long as Bank Nifty is trading below 22,500 where it's 20 DMA is placed one can opt for a sell on rise strategy.

Here is the list of three stocks which could return 8-17 percent in short term:

Tata Steel: Buy Around Rs 345 | Target: Rs 405 | Stop Loss: Rs 315 | Upside: 17 percent

The short-term correction seems to be over in the stock and bulls are likely to take the charge again. Formation of Bullish Harami candlestick pattern on daily timeframe suggests that bulls have entered the counter at lower levels. Further, the line of parity on the daily chart is providing good support which gives an additional signal that the short-term rally might not be ruled out in the coming days. Traders can initiate long positions around Rs 345 with a stop loss of Rs 315, and the target of Rs 405.

JSW Steel: Buy Around Rs 265 | Target: Rs 295 | Stop Loss: Rs 245 | Upside: 11 percent

The initial signal of trend reversal buying can be seen in the weekly chart as it found support from 200-week SMA. The momentum indicators have started trading in a bullish zone. On the daily time frame, it has formed Morning Star candlestick pattern suggest buying in the scrip. Positive crossover of medium-term moving averages are also giving cues to take long position in the stock. Traders can initiate buying at the price of Rs 265 for the short term towards Rs 295 with SL of Rs 245 mark.

ICICI Bank: Buy Around Rs 345 | Target: Rs 375 | Stop Loss: Rs 325 | Upside: 8 percent

After a prolonged downtrend, the stock is showing a sign of life. The short-term moving averages ribbon on the weekly time frame providing strong support positive curve and prices are also trading above all medium-term moving averages. The daily RSI is bouncing back from the important support level and other momentum indicators suggesting a short term pullback on upside in the stock in the coming days. Traders can initiate buying around Rs 345 levels for the target of Rs 375 with stop loss of Rs 325 mark.

One version is that siblings of JRD Tata, the late Chairman, had sold their shares in Tata Sons to the Shapoorji family. This happened in the 1960s and 1970s.

The second, and more popular version - perhaps because it's more fascinating - involves more characters and took place much earlier, in the 1920s. It involves an indebted Tata Steel, which decades later, was again a critical factor in the change in the equation between the two prominent business families.

Framroze Edulji Dinshaw was a well-known personality, not just among the Parsi community, but also among the business elite of the Mumbai of the 1920s. It was not thus surprising that the Tatas approached Dinshaw, a wealthy lawyer and landlord when two of their biggest investments - Tata Steel and Tata Hydro - faced a possibly debilitating financial squeeze.

Dinshaw lent a princely sum of Rs 2 crore, which was later converted into equity of 12.5 percent in Tata Sons. After the lawyer passed away, his descendants sold the stake to Shapoorji Pallonji, in 1936. Pallonji was the grandfather of Cyrus Mistry, the former Tata Sons Chairman who was booted out of Bombay House in 2016.

The 12.5 percent stake increased to over 17 percent in the 1970s when JRD Tata's siblings sold their stakes, and then to a little over 18 percent in 1996 when Tata Sons offered a rights issue. The legend goes that JRD was not amused by the increased say of the Pallonji family in the affairs of Bombay House. Later, the two resolved their differences.

At present, the Shapoorji Pallonji family has an 18.37 percent stake in Tata Sons.

More than three-fourths of a century later, when Mistry was forced to vacate his corner office at Tata Sons, one of the reasons was the difference of opinion over Tata Steel, specifically the UK business of its European arm that led to a mountain of debt.

The acquisition that went sore

It was no secret that Ratan Tata, then the Chairman of Tata Sons, had personally overseen the acquisition of Corus, for $13 billion in 2006.

By the time Mistry replaced him in 2013, it was clear that the expensive acquisition was not turning out to be desirable. In fact, the attempt in the ensuing years was to limit the losses. And one of the ways, Mistry found out, was to sell the loss-making businesses, especially those in the UK.

Mistry set in motion the process to sell the business, in parts. While he was keen to completely get out of the UK steel industry, sources earlier told Moneycontrol, Ratan Tata didn't agree. As a result, while some of the units, including those making speciality steel, were divested, other facilities were retained.

This included the Port Talbot facility that entrepreneur Sanjeev Gupta was keen to buy. Recently, in an interview with Moneycontrol, he repeated his offer.

The European business continues to struggle, and it didn't help that a much-hoped merger with German major thyssenkrupp's steel vertical failed. And the Indian arm continues to shoulder the losses in Europe.

The company incurred a consolidated net loss of Rs 4,609 crore in the April-June quarter, even though the Indian arm reported a profit of Rs 1,193.27 crore. The total debt crossed Rs 1 lakh crore in 2019 and stood at Rs 1.04 lakh crore as on March 2020.

The question and the counter

So was Mistry right in his strategy to sell off much of the European business? While the answer is debatable, the Tatas argue, the ousted Chairman doesn't lose an opportunity to highlight the challenges in the steel business. In the SP Group's statement on September 22, Tata Steel found prominent mention:

""It is a matter of public record that several issues identified years earlier, continue to plague the group. Be it the operations of Tata Steel UK, where over the last three years alone the operational losses have increased by an additional 11,000 crore or the Group’s aviation businesses.""

On the other hand, the Tatas reiterated that they have managed to shrink the problem.

Addressing the shareholders in the recent Tata Steel AGM, Chairman N Chandrasekaran pointed out the change in the company's geographical mix.

""While earlier one-third of the business was in India, and was profitable, two-thirds were international and not profitable. We have changed the mix. Now, two-thirds of the business is in India,"" he said.

The debate will continue until the UK business stabilises. The hope now is that the tussle between the two business families - the Tatas and the Shapoorji Pallonji family - may get resolved before that.",802,-0.5458219562258039

The British government has brought in investment bankers to salvage Tata Steel’s UK business to preserve thousands of jobs, after parent company Tata Steel said it would be unable to fund the European unit’s losses.

The country’s biggest steelmaker employs 8,000 people in the UK, including 3,500 at Port Talbot in south Wales.

The British Treasury has appointed Credit Suisse to advise on talks with Tata Steel, Sky News reported, also quoting sources say that McKinsey has been drafted to “draw up a blueprint for the future of the UK's wider steel industry.”

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

The move comes amid speculation that negotiations between the Indian company and the government had ended. Steel sector sources told the channel Tata Steel was “on the verge of presenting a revised proposal” involving substantial funding from the UK government.

Talks with Tata Steel have been ongoing for months and in July the company had put forth a proposal aimed at securing nearly 900 million pounds from the government for its UK operations. The investment would have semi-nationalised the steelmaker, giving taxpayers 50 percent stake.

Talks, however, fell through after officials disagreed on Tata Steel writing off an equivalent debt owed by its UK business, and not committing capital of its own, the report added.

The Treasury did not respond to queries, the report said.

Tata Steel told the channel they are in “active discussions with the UK government on several options for the future of our UK operations”, including “sustainable decarbonised footprint for the future.”

In a recent AGM, N Chandrasekaran said talks with the UK government are on and “we will do what is good for the company.”

""Given prevailing market conditions and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that our UK operations face structural challenges that need to be urgently addressed. Discussions with the government are constructive and ongoing, and at this stage, no decisions have been made,” the company said.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, several steelworkers have been put on paid leaves with companies seeking government aid. Thus, McKinsey’s involvement in charting out a plan for Britain’s broader steel future is being viewed as significant, industry sources said.

A government spokesperson told the channel that they remain “very supportive of the UK steel sector and its valuable contribution to the UK economy” and regularly uses external advise to “better understand how to support businesses.""

""Now each function in the company is being looked through the digital lens. It has a huge advantage, as digitally one can do much more than what was done manually,"" Rao had said.

The company is presently implementing the 'third wave' of its digital transformation. The initiative was first started in 2017, and the third wave gets over in 2022.

JSW Steel has already taken all its procurement activity digital, and also has robots to do 'routine operations'. Rao adds, ""Much of our operations and maintenance work is now digital.""

Apart from JSW Steel, Tata Steel has also set its focus on taking its retail presence online. In 2018, the company had launched Aashiyana, the e-platform that hosts all of its brands.

Focus on brands and retail network, which bring in higher margins, has become particularly important for steel companies post the COVID-19 disruption.

For JSW Steel, sales of value added and special products accounted for 48 percent of total sales volumes, in FY20. Branded products made up for nearly half of the total retail sales.

Push for e-retail

Traditionally, steelmakers focused on their B2B customers, especially those in the auto and construction sector. But that has been changing over the last decade.

At present, JSW Steel has an offline retail presence through JSW Shoppe, a network of stores that was launched in 2007. The network includes 400 stores, with plans to add 200 more. It also has international ambitions with a planned presence in Sri Lanka and Nepal.

The company has 13 brands, under which it sells products that cater to various requirements, including for doors, roofing and other construction needs.",441,0.9449102282524109

Tata Steel continues to be in talks with the UK government on possible financial aid for the company's operations in the country, Chairman N Chandrasekaran said on August 20.

Responding to concerns raised by the company shareholders over a virtual AGM, Chandrasekaran said, ""talks are not over."" He, however, underlined that the UK operations are not profitable and that it ""continues to be a drag.""

The clarification comes days after reports emerged from the UK that the government there has refused to support its operations there. The two sides were in talks for possible financial assistance.

""The government concluded the Indian multinational was sufficiently financed and didn’t qualify for taxpayer support,"" the Financial Times reported.

The talks are critical for the future of the company's operations in the country. Its other major facility in Europe, located in the Netherlands has also faced problems in the form of protest from employees.

Apart from clarifying that the situation was not as described by reports, Chandrasekaran also played down the auditor's note, in the recently announced Q1 results, doubting if the UK operations can continue as a going concern.

The Tata Steel Chairman signalled that the auditor's note was more a regulatory requirement, and said, ""Tata Sons and Tata Steel continue to do what is right.""

Tata Steel on August 13, had reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 4,648.13 crore for the June quarter of FY21. It had reported a loss of 1,615.35 crore in the March quarter and a profit of Rs 714.03 crore in the June quarter of FY20.

Talking about the European operations, Executive Director and CFO Koushik Chatterjee, said: ""Tata Steel Europe's performance was affected by lower deliveries and a sharp decline in European spreads to an unsustainably low level. As a result, our consolidated adjusted EBITDA dropped to Rs 1,038 crore.""

At the AGM, Chandrasekaran said that the company is striving to find a solution in this fiscal year. ""It could be matter of months before we have a decision. If it's not a successful outcome, we will be thinking about alternate options. We are looking for a solution that is lasting,"" he said.

Change in geographical mix

Earlier, while addressing the shareholders, Chandrasekaran pointed out the change in the company's geographical mix.

""While earlier one-third of the business was in India, and was profitable, two-thirds was international and was not profitable. We have changed the mix. Now, two-thirds of the business is in India,"" he said.

Over the years, the company has invested Rs 75,000 crore in the last four years to increase its India business. The investment included the Rs 35,000 crore it has spent on the new facility in Kalinganagar, in Odisha. The rest of the money has been used to acquire Bhushan Steel and Usha Martin.

Responding to shareholders concerns over the company debt, which stood at Rs, 1,04,779 as on March 2020, the Chairman said that the aim is to reduce this to Rs 75,000 crore, ""as fast as possible.""",508,-0.9360492626825968

ICICI Securities research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel has reported adjusted consolidated EBITDA of Rs10.4bn against consensus of Rs12.9bn. While standalone numbers were broadly in-line, Tata Steel Europe (TSE) disappointed with EBITDA loss of US$42/te (expected EBITDA loss of US$6/te). TSE EBITDA has gains on account of sales of emission rights and wage support from European and UK government, while exchange fluctuations impacted. Lower volumes in standalone operations (down 30% YoY) impacted EBITDA. Management did highlight Rs20bn in costs remain unabsorbed due to lower volumes i.e operating leverage impact. FCF generation has been very impressive at Rs7bn for the group broken into Rs16.8bn in India and Rs9.8bn overseas. This has helped maintain net debt QoQ.

Outlook

Tata Steel remains our top pick, as earnings tailwind (domestic price increases + impending price increase in Europe) and elevated net debt to market cap augurs well. Maintain BUY.

Auditors of Tata Steel Europe said they are doubtful about the company's ability to raise sufficient capital in the near term and continue as a going concern.

""Without qualifying our opinion on the special purpose financial information, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosure made in the special purpose financial information concerning Tata Steel Europe’s ability to continue as a going concern,” the auditors said, as quoted by The Economic Times.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

A Tata Steel Europe spokesperson told the paper that it ""remains an ongoing concern and constructive talks are on with the UK government on areas of potential support. As these discussions have not reached a conclusion, it would be premature to comment on any options that may or may not be under consideration.”

In Tata Steel’s Integrated Report and Annual Accounts 2019-20, the auditors cited a letter received by Tata Steel Europe, the report said.

Tata Steel Europe received a letter from TS Global Procurement Company (Tata Steel) undertaking ""to provide working capital up to a specified amount,"" which is higher than the forecast required by Tata Steel Europe over the next 12 months.

But the letter from TS Global stated that ""it represents present policy, is given by way of comfort only and is not to be construed as constituting a promise as its future funding plans.""

Due to this uncertainty, and other information in the ""special purpose financial information"" section of the annual accounts, the auditors raised doubts about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.

""Clearly, Tata Steel is trying to limit support only to the extent they believe the current shortfall may require, but is not giving an open cheque for all future adverse possibilities,"" an official told the publication.",297,-0.8900245825449625

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel’s (TATA) 1QFY21 consolidated EBITDA at INR5b (-91% YoY) was the weakest in the past 10 years. The COVID-19 crisis led to a sharp decline in both volumes and margins across all entities. -Margin outlook in Indian operations, however, is much better with prices bouncing back to near pre-COVID levels. Europe, though, should remain a drag with EBITDA losses expected to continue in the near term. We have raised FY21/FY22E EBITDA estimates by 16%/7% to factor in the improved outlook in Indian operations. However, leverage remains unfavorable at 6.8x FY21 EBITDA. Maintain Neutral.

Outlook

At CMP, the stock trades at 6.3x FY22E EV/EBITDA. Maintain Neutral with TP of INR433/share based on FY22E EV/EBITDA of 6.5x for Indian operations and 5x for Europe.

ICICI Direct's research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel reported subdued Q1FY21 results wherein consolidated topline came in line with our estimate while consolidated EBITDA was notably lower than our estimate. The EBITDA/tonne of both Indian, European operations came in lower than our estimate. Standalone operations reported sales volume of ~2.1 million tonnes (MT). European operations reported steel sales of 2.0 MT, marginally higher than our estimate of 1.9 MT. Tata Steel BSL reported sales volume of 0.7 MT (higher than our estimate of 0.65 MT). Consolidated topline was at Rs 24289 crore (down 32% YoY, 28% QoQ), largely in line with our estimate of Rs 23010 crore. Consolidated reported EBITDA was at Rs 506 crore while adjusted EBITDA was at Rs 1038 crore (notably lower than our estimate of Rs 1634 crore). For the quarter, the company reported exceptional gain (net) of Rs 58 crore. Subsequently, on a consolidated basis, the company reported a net loss of Rs 4609 crore.

Outlook

Tata Steel reported a muted consolidated performance in Q1FY21. At the consolidated level, ~Rs 2000 crore of costs was under absorbed due to lower volumes and have been charged to the P&L, thereby impacting its operating performance during the quarter. However, going forward, we expect Tata Steel standalone operations’ Q2FY21 performance to improve (from Q1FY21 levels), on the back of higher realisations QoQ, lower coking coal costs and QoQ higher domestic sales volume. We value the stock on SoTP basis and arrive at a target price of Rs 450. We maintain our HOLD rating on the stock.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel (TATA) reported Q1FY21 EBITDA below our/consensus estimates by 76%/61% at Rs5.1bn (down 89% QoQ/down 91% YoY), due to lower than expected earnings across operations. Impacted by weak spreads and lower volumes, TATA Steel Europe (TSE) reported EBITDA loss of US$82mn (v/s PLe: Loss of US$45mn and positive EBITDA of US$9mn in Q4FY20). Indian operations earnings missed our/consensus estimates by 32%/18% owing to lower volumes and higher than expected costs. Domestic EBITDA margins fell 53% QoQ/↓55% YoY to Rs5,900/t (PLe:Rs8,420). Stock moved up ~35% over last couple of months in light of strong recovery improvement in Chinese prices (up 25% from bottom) and low coking coal prices. We maintain our bearish outlook on the sector as we see weakness in steel prices Q3CY20 onwards due to ease in China’s pent-up demand and sharp increase in global steel production, led by strong margins.

Outlook

Weak market outlook, over-stretched debt levels (Net debt/EBITDA of 5.0x on normalized FY22e earnings) and weak overseas asset portfolio drives our negative view on the stock. Hence, we maintain Reduce rating with TP of Rs300 (Earlier Rs250), EV/EBITDA of 6.5x FY22e.

Steel demand is expected to decline significantly in 2020-21 in line with a projected contraction in the global economy due to the impact of coronavirus pandemic, Tata Steel has said in its annual report.

Most of the steel producing regions are expected to witness a decline in crude steel output due to production cuts amidst ongoing lockdowns, Tata Steel said.

The global economic growth is expected to see a contraction of over 3 percent in 2020, Tata Steel Chairman N Chandrasekaran said terming the slump as the ""worst contraction"" since the 1930s.

A contraction in the global GDP is not at all a good sign for the global steel sector as steel demand is positively correlated with the economic growth.

""Global GDP growth eased to 2.9 percent in 2019, against an initial growth projection of 3.5 percent... As we look ahead, it is important to gauge COVID-19's unprecedented impact on the global economy. It is expected that global growth will contract by over 3 percent in 2020, the worst contraction since the 1930's,"" Chandrasekaran said in the Annual Report for 2019-20.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Chandrasekaran also said that this is for the first time since the Great Depression, that both advanced and developing economies are in recession together.

The impact of the slowing economy was also felt in the global steel sector. Global crude steel production reached 1,870 million tonne (MT) in 2019, registering a more modest growth of 3.4 percent in 2019 against 4.6 percent in 2018, he said.

In India also, he said, the growth slowed to 4.2 percent in FY 2019-20 against an initial growth projection of 7.5 percent in the beginning of the year.

The domestic steel sector registered a stark easing of growth to 1.8 percent in 2019 compared to 7.7 percent growth in the previous year.

The country was just beginning to show signs of coming out of a protracted slowdown that began in early 2018 when COVID-19 arrived, Chandrasekaran added.

Tata Steel's CEO and MD T V Narendran, and Executive Director and CFO Koushik Chatterjee said FY2020 was undoubtedly a challenging year not just for the company but for most businesses across the globe.

Almost all countries faced a slowdown in economic growth amidst rising trade tensions and policy uncertainties.

This had its bearing on the steel industry as well, in terms of weak demand and falling steel prices.

Making matters worse, the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 brought global economic activities to a near standstill as nationwide lockdowns and social distancing norms were imposed to contain the spread in the affected countries.

""Although the manufacturing sector is expected to stage a relatively quick recovery, supply chain disruptions are likely to continue. The key steel-consuming sectors will continue to be sluggish,"" the report said.

On the outlook of the steel sector, the company report said the COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected economies and industries globally and the steel industry is no exception.

""Outlook for the steel industry includes scenarios regarding the pandemic's speed of propagation, possible recurrence, near-term impact of measures being taken to contain the outbreak, and the effectiveness of the stimulus announced by the governments of various nations. After slower than expected growth in 2019, steel demand is estimated to contract significantly in the FY21,"" it said.

Most of the steel producing regions are expected to witness a decline in crude steel output due to production cuts amidst ongoing lockdowns.

However, it is expected that compared to other countries, China will move faster towards normalisation of economic activity as it was the first country to come out of the COVID-19 crisis. In India, it said, muted demand and oversupply is likely to result in suppressed steel prices and capacity utilization in the near term.

Since India depends largely on migrant labour, restarting construction and infrastructure projects will be a challenge.

The demand from infrastructure, construction, and real estate sectors is likely to be subdued in the first half of the FY21 due to the lockdown during the first quarter followed by the monsoons during the second quarter.

Further, the demand from automobile, white goods, and capital goods sectors is likely to reduce significantly with consumers deferring discretionary spends in the near term. Effective government stimulus and return of consumer confidence is likely to be the key driver for a gradual recovery over the second half of the FY2021, it said.

Better prices and demand for its products will help Tata Steel improve its realisations by Rs 3,000 per ton in the second quarter, as compared to the first, said TV Narendran, CEO and MD.

""That is the minimum that we are expecting,"" Narendran told analysts in a call on August 14.

In the first quarter ending June 30, the company had said, its realisations were hurt because of the COVID-19 disruption. Overall, the steel major had reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 4,648.13 crore for the June quarter of FY21. It had reported a loss of 1,615.35 crore in the March quarter and a profit of Rs 714.03 crore in the June quarter of FY20.

But things will start looking up from the second quarter, the company has hinted, as most of its clients start ramping up production. Tata Steel's capacity utilisation, which had slumped by over 50 percent post the lockdown in March, is back to 95 percent in July.

The recovery has been led by clients in the auto sector, which consumes about 20 percent of the steel produced in India. ""The auto forecast has been improving week after week. Earlier it was only the tractors, and now the two-wheeler segment, helped by demand from the rural markets, is doing well,"" Narendran said.

The top Tata Steel executive said that while passenger vehicles are recovering fast, the same couldn't be said of medium and heavy commercial vehicles. The lighter commercial vehicles are faring better.

The better demand scenario has already helped the company take a price hike of up to Rs 2,500 per ton, since June."" Though current prices are still below their pre-COVID-19 levels, it is unusual to see rates going up during the monsoon,"" Narendran said.

Demand for steel usually falls during the monsoon, when construction activity - the biggest consumer of steel - comes to a standstill. But 2020, has been a different year on all counts.

The improving domestic scenario will also see Tata Steel selling more in its home market, instead of exporting.

While in the first quarter it had shipped half of its production to overseas markets, mainly in China and South-East Asia, exports will come down further in the second quarter. ""In the second quarter, we will export 25 percent of our production,"" said Narendran.

""India's average steel realisations were lower due to the COVID impact during Q1. About Rs 2,000 crore of costs were under absorbed due to the lower volumes and have been charged to the profit and loss account,"" the company said.

Despite the drop in margins, there was a reduction in net debt of Rs 1,677 crore in India, including a reduction of Rs 577 crore and Rs 291 crore at Tata Steel BSL and Tata Steel Long Products, respectively.

The management said that given the uncertain economic environment, it has built up a liquidity buffer of Rs 20,144 crore, including Rs 14,178 crore of cash and cash equivalents.

Commenting on the quarterly performance, TV Narendran, CEO and Managing Director, said: ""We were successful in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 as we pivoted the business towards export markets and successfully generated free cash flows despite adverse market conditions.""

Narendran said he is cautiously optimistic that 'the worst is behind us'.

Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and CFO, said: ""Tata Steel Europe's performance was affected by lower deliveries and a sharp decline in European spreads to an unsustainably low level. As a result, our consolidated adjusted EBITDA dropped to Rs 1,038 crore.""",349,-0.24002599716186523

Tata Steel is expected to post a loss in the range of Rs 1,900-2,900 crore for the quarter ended June 2020, as lockdown in several countries due to COVID-19 crisis impacted steel demand.

According to brokerage houses, revenue from operations could fall more than 35 percent year-on-year as volumes declined sharply while operating performance is expected to be impacted majorly by Europe which is likely to post a loss at the EBITDA level.

""We estimate steel realisation to decline by 9 percent QoQ (down 17 percent YoY) due to higher exports and lower prices in the domestic markets on the resumption of activities,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which expects volumes to decline sharply by 35 percent YoY (down 33 percent QoQ) at 1.96 million tonnes during Q1 FY21, factoring the impact of COVID-19.

India EBITDA per tonne may decline by 36 percent QoQ (down 36 percent YoY) due to lower realisations, Kotak said, adding that Europe EBITDA loss per tonne may come at $35 per tonne due to declining steel spreads and a sharp cut in steel volumes due to the partial shutdowns at plants.

Motilal Oswal expects consolidated loss at Rs 2,928.6 crore for the quarter with 81 percent fall YoY (down 78 percent QoQ) in EBITDA.

The United Kingdom government may invest nearly 900 million pounds for equity stake in Tata Steel UK’s Port Talbot plant, if ongoing talks succeed.

The company has reportedly put forward proposals aimed at securing one billion pounds from the government for its UK operations, The Economic Times reported. The proposal also includes Tata Steel writing off equivalent debt owed by its UK business.

For the government, this investment would semi-nationalise the country’s biggest steelmaker, giving taxpayers 50 percent stake, and is being viewed as a way to sustain the company’s UK operations amid the coronavirus pandemic, it added.

A spokesperson for Tata Steel Europe told the paper that structural challenges due to disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic “needs to be urgently addressed.”

“(We are in) active discussion with the UK government on several options for the future of Port Talbot operations. This includes potential co-operation and participation from the government to create a sustainable decarbonised footprint for the future,” the spokesperson added.

On the ‘de-carbonisation’ front, one option is switching to a greener electric blast furnace instead of the plant’s current traditional one. Talks however are not yet finalised, but are “constructive and ongoing”, the spokesperson said.

Any move in this direction by the UK government would likely be taken under ‘Project Birch’ which provides financial assistance to businesses suffering due to the pandemic, though the specifics are yet unclear.

Tata Steel has laid aside plans to sell its Building Systems unit, which makes cladding and insulation panels, two sources close to the matter said, citing uncertainty in the industry that was aggravated by the coronavirus crisis.

Tata Steel late last year hired French investment bank Credit Agricole to help find a buyer for the business operating in Britain, Norway and Sweden, which banking sources value at less than $500 million.

""Like any company, we continue to review our portfolio of businesses to ensure they are sustainable over the longer term,"" a Tata Steel spokesperson told Reuters when asked about the sales plan.

Credit Agricole did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In 2019, Europe's second largest steel producer Tata Steel Europe announced a major overhaul of its British and Dutch activities, at the cost of around 3,000 jobs, as the steel sector grappled with the effects of overcapacity, cheap Chinese imports and U.S. trade tariffs.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the sources told Reuters Tata Steel put its sales effort on hold in March as the COVID-19 pandemic sapped demand further.

Wide sections of industry, including automakers and construction that are the steel industry's main clients, shut during lockdowns to curb the coronavirus.

With an uncertain outlook in many end markets, companies facing financing pressures and with costly non-core divisions will need to simplify their portfolio to focus on their core activities, said Tristan Nagler, UK managing director of Aurelius, which buys businesses that have been carved out of big corporates.

Tata Steel Ltd (TSL) on Thursday said its consolidated sales fell 22.8 percent to 5.28 million tonnes (MT) during April-June quarter 2020 as compared to consolidated sales of 6.84MT in the year-ago period, as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted operations.

The consolidated production during the quarter also fell 28.49 percent to 5.52MT from 7.72MT in the first quarter of 2019-20, TSL said in a regulatory filing.

In the just concluded quarter, TSL's India sales were at 2.92MT, down from 3.96MT in the year-ago period, while the production volume fell to 2.99MT from 4.5MT.

The company's sales in Europe fell to 1.94MT from 2.26MT in the year-ago period, while production fell to 2.14MT from 2.65MT.

Tata Steel South East Asia registered sales of 0.42MT compared to 0.62MT in first quarter of 2019-20, while the output was at 0.39MT, as against 0.57MT in the same quarter a year ago.

Tata Steel said overall first quarter of 2020-21 production and sales volumes were lower as the outbreak of COVID-19 and ensuing mobility restrictions severally impacted industrial activity and consumer sentiment across all geographies.

""In India, capacity utilisation of our upstream facilities was adjusted to about 50 percent level in April while our downstream units were closed,” the company said.

With the phased opening of the economy, the company stated that the utilisation levels have been ramped up gradually to around 80 percent level by end of June, adding that downstream facilities have also been restarted and are being ramped up progressively.

Tata Steel said to counter the closure of the Indian markets in April and May, export was ramped up significantly by tapping new markets and improving the supply chain capability and will constitute around 50 percent of total sales volume in the first quarter of 2020-21.

""While April and May sales were lower, sales improved significantly in June as economic activity resumed in India. With the continued opening of the economy and the improvement in domestic demand, the proportion of domestic sales will increase from second quarter,"" the company added.

Tata Steel said while urban markets are showing slow recovery, retail sales, especially in rural markets, are seeing an improvement in demand.

Workers at Tata Steel's main plant in the Netherlands ended a three-week strike on Friday after the company said there would be no compulsory layoffs under a planned reorganisation of its Dutch operations.

""We are pleased to announce we have reached an agreement with all unions involved,"" Tata Steel's Dutch division said in a statement.

""The transformation programme will not lead to forced redundancies at Tata Steel Netherlands.""

The company did not say whether there would be a voluntary redundancy programme but said it would now extend its current jobs pact for IJmuiden, which stipulates no forced layoffs, by five years until October 2026.

Workers at the IJmuiden plant went on strike on June 10 after unions said the company had outlined plans to scrap around 1,000 of the 9,000 jobs at the site as part of a reorganisation of its European operations.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Tata Steel Europe last year announced a major overhaul of its British and Dutch activities, at the cost of around 3,000 jobs in total.

Tata Steel Europe has said IJmuiden needs to become more profitable as the steel sector grappled with the effects of overcapacity, cheap Chinese imports and US trade tariffs, even before the global coronavirus recession hit.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Tata Steel

Indian business delivered a strong operating performance, with EBITDA of Rs12,187/t. However, we note that the bigger surprise was Europe delivering positive EBITDA of $4/t. We expect the TSE business to report a loss in H1, due to compressing steel spreads. Leverage remains high and absolute net debt is also above the Rs1tn mark. We expect no deleveraging in FY21 and FY22 as the support to Europe and capex in India will ensure high leverage. Only an uptick in the steel cycle will not support deleveraging. Lower capex in FY21 implies that the Kalinganagar–II project is delayed further. We note that the pellet plant at Kalinganagar will also come up after 12-15 months. The second wave of Covid-19 in Europe, China and other parts of the world will impact steel further.



Outlook

We cut our FY21/22E steel deliveries by 12%/9% and EBITDA by 49%/12%. We expect Tata Steel to report a loss in FY21. We roll over valuation to Mar-22 on a SoTP basis and cut the TP to Rs340 (from Rs485). Downgrade to Hold (from Buy), with UW in Sector EAP.

More than three years after he nearly bought the UK-based Port Talbot plant from Tata Steel, Indian-origin metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta has repeated his offer.

""If we are offered, we are ready to look at it. We have a strong relationship with the Tata Group, and are ready to explore any kind of partnership with them,"" Gupta told Moneycontrol in an interview.

""The question is of Tata's drive. Am always ready,"" the billionaire owner of Liberty Steel Group, added. Liberty Steel is part of the $20 billion GFG Alliance, owned by the Gupta family, and operates across steel, aluminium and energy sectors.

The offer comes at a time when Tata Steel's European unit continues to struggle but could be close to clinching a life-saving deal with the UK government to get financial aid to revive the Port Talbot plant, which is located in Wales. While the company had asked for a 500-million pound aid, it is not clear yet how much the final assistance would be.

Also, a senior executive points out that the UK government will only provide assistance over a business plan that envisions the facility making money. ""Right now that looks difficult,"" says the senior executive. There are reports that the UK government may take equity in the plant, in return for the financial assistance.

Tata Steel Europe is also facing problems in its Netherlands unit, where workers have gone on a strike.

In 2017, Gupta had taken over the speciality steel businesses of Tata Steel UK, in a deal worth about 100 million pounds. These included facilities in Rotherham, Stocksbridge and Brinsworth. The deal had also initially included the Port Talbot facility.

""We were one hair's breadth away from doing it,"" is how Gupta described the moment in an interview with BBC in 2017.

The entrepreneur continues to rue the missed opportunity. ""We were ready to take over all of Tata Steel's operations in the UK. But then changes happened,"" he says.

Though Gupta didn't elaborate on the 'changes,' industry executives point at the developments at Bombay House, the headquarters of the Tata Group. In 2016, the then chairman Cyrus Mistry was ousted in a board room tussle. ""While Mistry was keen to exit the UK steel businesses, the view changed later on,"" is how a senior industry executive explains it.

That Gupta continues to have an eye on Port Talbot is clear in the way he talks about the unit. ""It's just a 20-minute drive from my home, where am presently residing,"" he says over a Microsoft Teams call.

Close to Tata Steel UK's facility is Liberty's Newport unit, which is investing on a new electric arc furnace that will use scrap to make steel, a process that now Gupta champions and calls 'GREENSTEEL.'

The turnaround

From the time he acquired units from Tata Steel, Gupta invested in the facilities, and even turned them around.

""If you look at other sales of Tata Steel UK units, including those in Teeside and Scunthorpe, neither worked out. But we have turned around Rotherham, and all the other facilities were ramped up and were making money before COVID-19 struck,"" says Gupta.

The Rotherham unit was producing 2.25 lakh tons of steel a year, when Gupta bought it. The businessman has already doubled the capacity and now wants to further expand it to over a million tons a year.

While the expansion plan is on, Gupta has streamlined production at all his units across Europe, to adjust to the demand slump post-COVID-19.",593,0.30668304363886517

Tata Steel’s (TATA) 4Q EBITDA rose 28% QoQ to INR46.5b and surprised positively led by improved performance in Europe and Bhushan. Near term earnings outlook is weak due to lower domestic demand necessitating higher exports which adversely impacts EBITDA. Moreover, leverage remains discomforting at 8x of FY21 EBITDA. Given the challenges in Europe, we cut our FY21/22 EBITDA estimates marginally and maintain our Neutral rating on the stock.



Outlook

Despite curtailing growth capex, we expect net-debt/ EBITDA to remain high at 8.1x in FY21 and 4.7x in FY22. Maintain Neutral with a TP of INR328/sh (based on SOTP).

ICICI Direct's research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel reported healthy operational numbers wherein EBITDA came in higher than our estimate while European operations surprised positively by reporting positive EBITDA/tonne. However bottomline was impacted by exceptional expenses that led to a net loss for the quarter. Standalone operations reported sales volume of ~3.0 million tonnes (MT), marginally lower than our estimate of 3.1 MT. European operations reported steel sales of 2.4 MT, higher than our estimate of 2.3 MT. Bhushan Steel reported sales volume of 0.98 MT (lower than our estimate of 1.25 MT). The consolidated topline came in at Rs 33770.0 crore (down 20.4% YoY, 4.9% QoQ), largely in line with our estimate of Rs 34622.3 crore. Consolidated EBITDA came in at Rs 4646.9 crore (down 38.2% YoY, up 28.4% QoQ), higher than our estimate of Rs 3500.8 crore. For the quarter, the company reported exceptional expense (net) to the tune of Rs 3405.9 crore. Exceptional expense was primarily due to impairment at Tata Steel Europe, Tata Steel Mineral Canada, Tata Steel SEZ (cumulatively Rs 3029 crore) and notional loss on fair valuation of preference shares held in TRF (Rs 272 crore). Subsequently, on a consolidated basis, the company reported a net loss of Rs 1236 crore.

Outlook

In April 2020, Tata Steel’s Indian operations operated at ~50% capacity utilisation. With the phased removal of lockdown restrictions in India, Tata Steel’s upstream steelmaking operations have been ramped up and are currently operating at about 80% utilisation levels. Downstream units have reopened and are steadily ramping up. In Europe, Tata Steel Europe continues to operate at about 70% utilisation. After a muted Q1FY21 (on account of Covid-19 related concerns), the management expects to return to normal capacity utilisation levels by Q2FY21. We continue to value the company on an SOTP basis and arrive at a target price of Rs 350. We maintain our HOLD rating on the stock.

Tata Steel, which posted a consolidated net loss at Rs 1,095.7 crore for the quarter ended March 2020, has said that it may cut its capital expenditure by half for the present financial year as it refocuses on conserving cash.

""Last year, we had a capex of Rs 9,500 crore. For this year, the capex will be cut by 50 percent, if not more,"" said Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer, while addressing a media call.

""The COVID-19 outbreak has led to an unprecedented health crisis and has disrupted economic activities and global trade while weighing on consumer sentiment. Consequently, global steel demand is expected to be sharply lower in 2020 before a meaningful recovery in 2021,"" Tata Steel had earlier said in a statement.

The steel major is not alone in trying to conserve cash. Its domestic peer JSW Steel had also cut its capital expenditure for FY 21. The company has reduced its capex to Rs 9,000 crore from the earlier guidance of Rs 16,340 crore.

This was the second consecutive cut on the capex. In FY 2020 too, JSW Steel had reduced the expenditure, to Rs 11,000 crore from Rs 15,700 crore announced. The company ended up spending Rs 10,200 by the end of the 2020 financial year.

Capacity utilisation improves

TV Narendran, Tata Steel's CEO & Managing Director, said that the company has been ramping up its production since April.

While the capacity utilisation in April was 50 percent, that improved to up to 70 percent in May. From July, Narendran added, the company plans to achieve full capacity utilisation.

Steelmaking was listed as one of the essential services by the Government.

Steel maker Tata Steel on June 29 has posted a consolidated net loss at Rs 1,095.7 crore for the quarter-ended March 31, which was less than the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18 at Rs 1,300 crore. It had reported a profit of Rs 2,430.9 crore in the same period last year.

Consolidated revenue from operations, which was largely in line with estimates, declined 20.4 percent year-on-year to Rs 33,770 crore for the quarter impacted by the worldwide lockdown.

""The COVID-19 outbreak has led to an unprecedented health crisis and disrupted economic activities and global trade while weighing on consumer sentiment. Consequently, global steel demand is expected to be sharply lower in 2020 before a meaningful recovery in 2021,"" Tata Steel said in a BSE filing.

Consolidated steel production for the quarter increased by 2.2 percent YoY to 7.37 million tonne, but deliveries were down 13.6 percent to 6.5 MT. India's steel production rose by 5.6 percent YoY to 4.73 MT, but deliveries fell 14.6 percent to 4.03 MT in Q4FY20, it added.

Operating performance declined but was ahead of analysts' estimates. Consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 38.1 percent to Rs 4,646.9 crore and margin dropped 390 bps to 13.8 percent.

As per estimates of a CNBC-TV18 poll, EBITDA was estimated at Rs 3,990 crore with margin at 11.8 percent.

The management said with the phased removal of the lockdown restrictions in India, upstream steel making operations have been ramped up and were currently operating around 80 percent utilisation levels.

""In Europe, Tata Steel Europe continues to operate around 70 percent utilisation levels. Key steel consuming sectors such as automotive and construction continue to be adversely affected, though demand for packaging material has seen a sharp upsurge,"" it added.

In FY20, the company reported a 73.6 percent decline in profit at Rs 2,719.58 crore and 11.3 percent fall in revenue at Rs 1,39,816.65 crore.

India steel production grew 8 percent YoY to 18.20 MT in FY20 with ramp up at Tata Steel BSL and acquisition of Usha Martin's steel business by Tata Steel Long Products, the management said, adding deliveries grew 4 percent YoY to 16.97 MT.

In Europe, liquid steel production marginally declined to 10.26 MT in FY20 and deliveries fell 4 percent to 9.29 MT due to overall weakness in economic activity.

TV Narendran, its CEO and Managing Director, said, ""While there will be a sharp drop in volumes in Q1FY21, we are seeing early signs of recovery and remain poised to leverage our position on normalisation of business conditions.""

The company has announced a dividend payment of Rs 10 per ordinary share and Rs 2.504 per partly paid ordinary share for FY20.",468,-0.40824406743049624

Hundreds of workers of Tata Steel's unit at IJmuiden in the Netherlands have gone on strike, demanding job security, according to labour union Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging (FNV).

The Dutch operations of the company have been facing protests and demonstrations for over a week.

According to the Netherlands-based workers' union, employees of Tata Steel are worried and demanding job security from the management.

""This morning the office staff of Tata Steel are on strike in IJmuiden. FNV estimates that about 400 people attended the strike event,"" FNV said in a statement.

There is enormous anger and concern for their jobs among the workers, FNV Metaal Director Roel Berghuis said adding ""We keep going. We will not let our company be destroyed. Hands off IJmuiden!""

On Tuesday, he said as long as workers don't get anything to hear from the company's management, the strikes will continue.

Since June 10, there have been strikes at several locations in the IJmuiden unit. Due to strikes, work was interrupted in the ore preparation, warehouses, rolling mill, at research and development and other departments.

According to the Dutch labour union, of which thousands of Tata Steel IJmuiden plant workers are members, the ""inevitable move"" was taken when the management of Tata Steel did not respond to the demands of the employees.

Tata Steel had earlier said it recognises the uncertainty in the minds of the employees and respects the rights of the workers in IJmuiden steelworks.

It had also said that in the current environment of global uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has been working with all stakeholders, including the unions in both Netherlands and the UK, to meet the challenges.

It also requested the union in the Netherlands to postpone industrial action so it could continue discussions and find the best way forward to meet everyone's interests.

The industrial action would only put further pressure on the company's results as it continues to deal with the impact of lower steel demand caused by the pandemic, Tata Steel had said.",347,-0.9969030141830444

Dutch Tata Steel employees held further strike actions on Monday to protest against job cuts planned as part of a broader restructuring, the FNV union said.

A strike by workers on the nightshift, which started on Sunday at 2000 GMT, caused the entire production of packaging steel at Tata's IJmuiden plant to come to a standstill, FNV spokesman Roel Berghuis said.

It was the third day of strike actions at IJmuiden since they began on June 10, as employees demand a guarantee that a planned transformation of Tata's European steel activities will not lead to redundancies at Dutch operations.

FNV and other labour unions together represent more than 50% of Tata's 9,000 employees in IJmuiden.

The Dutch unions say Tata is planning to cut 1,000 of 9,000 jobs in the Netherlands as part of a wider restructuring of its British-based European operations. Tata Europe says it does not plan forced redundancies.",161,-0.9886926710605621

Performance of metal sector is a key economic indicator which measures the depth of economy. The sector has been underperforming since last few years due to US-China trade deal, subdued growth and muted demand. But what puts further questions on this sector’s growth is impact of COVID-19. Let us try to understand the factors which might play as X-factor for metals along with its outlook.

Primarily, metal sector is struggling with over-supply, lower demand, thus leading to low prices of metals and continuously rising inventories. Now that the lockdown is being lifted in a phased manner, there is a possibility of revival in coming few quarters. However, prices are expected to remain on the muted side until there is a major surge in demand or sharp off-loading in inventory volume. This has put a heavy toll on the stocks and metal index corrected around 65 percent from 2018 highs and made its bottom in March 2020.

As sector is highly dependent on many other peripheral sectors, demand accounted is sizable and directly impacts consuming sectors, hence, the collapse of demand from various industries have left sector stranded. Amidst this crisis, most consumers and industries have postponed discretionary spending, plus there is a muted demand in all industries, barring essentials such as groceries and FMCGs has put a pressure on the sector.

Sectors that are directly affected include white goods, capital goods, automobiles and all these sectors are major consumers of metals. So in a way there has been significant indirect impact on metal sector.

The government's plan to boost infrastructure investments across the country has also come to a halt and it might again pick-up from June. Metal sectors’ revival is very much dependent on how aggressively government resumes its spending on infrastructure sectors and how fast it also stars executing the new projects.

The Modi government has already emphasized multiple times that infrastructure is the top priority for the government which is a silver lining for the sector. However, in the now changed circumstances, it is important to see how the investments pans out in the infra sector.

To compensate for the low domestic demand, steel players are looking for an opportunity to increase their reach into export markets. Currently, China is one of the major exporters of metals in the world and India looks forward to gaining a piece of pie.

The sector comprises both organized and unorganized players, but majority of public listed players are positioned at favorable risk and return. During the lockdown most of the large steel companies such as JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Jindal steel and power, tried to maintain their production, but other companies failed to keep it up and running. Now the major concerns would be shortage of labor as many have returned back to their native states and companies might face a challenge in bringing them back early.

Softening of US-China tensions could be game changer for sector as due to this, metals have been under-performing in last few years. China, being the largest exporter of metals, any trade war could lead to uncertainty and adverse outlook on the sector.

Since the sector has seen the worst and economy is opening up, there is a fair chance that the sector would perform well in short to medium term. Stocks like Tata Steel, Hindalco and Mishra Dhatu Nigam (MIDHANI) are positioned at attractive valuations and might give good returns over the time.

The country's coal import dropped by 20 percent to 18.93 million tonnes (MT) last month, industry data showed. The government is planning to bring the country's 'avoidable coal imports' to zero by 2023-24.

Demand for coal import is expected to remain subdued in the short-term given the high coal stock levels in pithead and power plants, according to mjunction.

The coal import in May last year stood at 23.57 MT, it said. mjunction -- a joint venture between Tata Steel and SAIL -- is a B2B e-commerce company that also publishes research reports on coal and steel verticals.

However, coal import during last month through the major and non-major ports is estimated to have increased by 10.76 percent over April 2020, according to a provisional compilation by mjunction services limited, based on monitoring of vessels' positions and data received from shipping companies.

""The slight uptick in May imports over the previous month might have resulted from the partial re-start of operations in some sectors as well as the continued softness in coal prices in the international markets.

""However, given the high coal stock levels in pithead and power plants, we expect import demand to remain subdued in the short-term,"" mjunction MD and CEO Vinaya Varma said.

Import of coal in May stood at 18.93 MT (provisional) as compared to 17.09 MT (revised) in April 2020, mjunction said.

Of the total imports last month, the import of non-coking coal was at 13.22 MT, against 12.28 MT in April.

Coking coal imports were at 3.81 MT in May, up from 3.23 MT imported a month ago.

During April-May, total coal import was at 36.02 MT, registering a decline of 27.83 percent from 49.90 MT imported during the same period of the previous year.

During April-May, non-coking coal imports stood at 25.50 MT, from 35.35 MT imported during April-May 2019.

Coking coal imports were at 7.04 MT during April-May, down from 8.77 MT earlier.

Coal India Ltd (CIL), which accounts for over 80 percent of the domestic fuel output, has been mandated by the government to replace at least 100 MT of imports with domestically-produced coal in the ongoing fiscal.

The Centre had earlier asked power generating companies, including NTPC, Tata Power and Reliance Power, to reduce import of the dry fuel for blending purposes and replace it with domestic coal.

The power sector is a key coal consumer.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also given directions to target thermal coal import substitution, particularly when huge coal stock inventory is available in the country this year.

Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi had earlier written to state chief ministers asking them not to import coal and take domestic supply from CIL, which has the fuel in abundance.

India's antitrust body has ruled that units of Sweden's AB SKF, Germany's Schaeffler AG and Tata Steel Ltd, along with local firm National Engineering Industries, are guilty of colluding and fixing prices of vehicle ball bearings.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) began a probe into the matter in 2017 after receiving information that the entities had been colluding on bearings prices from 2009-2014, to pass on higher raw material costs to customers in the auto sector.

In a 36-page order issued on Friday, the CCI said it ""holds NEI, Schaeffler, SKF and Tata Bearing guilty"" of contravening the country's antitrust laws.

However, it added that it had decided not to impose a penalty, saying the ""ends of justice would be met if the parties cease such cartel behaviour and desist from indulging in it.""

The CCI order showed the case was initiated after Schaeffler in 2017 filed a so-called leniency application, in which companies seek lesser penalties and make disclosures about their activities.

Later, National Engineering Industries also filed a similar plea under the leniency programme, the CCI order said.

Tata Steel's bearings division, SKF, Schaeffler and National Engineering Industries did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

Reuters reported last year that CCI's investigations arm concluded that SKF India, Schaeffler India, Tata Steel's bearings unit and National Engineering Industries had contravened antitrust law by discussing and agreeing prices.",243,-0.8796378076076508

Four of the six metals and mining companies listed among the top 100 brands in India, saw their brand value increase last year despite the difficult circumstances.

The four that saw their brand value inching up were - Tata Steel, Vedanta, JSW Steel and SAIL. On the other hand, Hindalco and Coal India saw their brand value diminishing.

The ranking was done by Brand Finance India, in its latest 2020 report.

Coming at the top was Tata Steel, also the largest Indian steelmaker. Its brand value went up by 16 percent to $1.3 billion, from $1.16 billion last year. Vedanta came in second, with its brand value increasing by 10.5 percent to $786 million. JSW Steel was third, with a brand value of $719 million, up 8.6 percent.

Hindalco, part of the Aditya Birla Group, saw its brand value drop by 6.4 percent, to $416 million. Coal India's brand value was down 5.8 percent, at $413 million.

Overall, the Tata Group retained the top rank as India's most valuable brand. Reliance Industries was among the biggest gainers, with its brand value up 25 percent.

Trying times

Despite Tata Steel's top billing in the metals and mining sector, the company has been facing headwinds, both in its domestic and European businesses.

The European arm has been facing a crisis, with workers in the Netherlands plant protesting the exit of a top official. Reports say that the company may be forced to break-up its European operations, and separate the UK business from the Netherlands one.

Vedanta has been in the news recently after it announced plans to de-list from exchanges in India.

JSW Steel, the steelmaker with the highest capacity in India, saw its Q4 profit shrink 87 percent.

While most of these companies have begun ramping up their capacity, after some relaxations during the lockdown, low demand and unavailability of labour continue to create stress. Much of the demand for these companies come from customers in the auto and constructions sectors.

A group of around 100 striking workers blocked the doors at Tata Steel's main IJmuiden plant in the Netherlands on Tuesday morning, in what labour representatives said was a spontaneous move and a prelude to major action in the coming weeks.

Workers at the Dutch subsidiary have been unhappy since the departure last week of their CEO Theo Henrar, which prompted an angry response as he was seen as a strong advocate against Tata's plans to cut around 1,000 jobs in the Netherlands.

Frits van Wieringen, the spokesman of the company's works council, said Tuesday's unplanned strike had not affected production, but that the council expected a ""major action"" in the short term.

""People are so angry, this situation is certain to escalate"", he said.

Tata Steel Netherlands' Central Works Council (CWC) has said it fears that Tata Steel Europe aimed to cut its Dutch operations in order to save its loss-making British business.

A change of guard at an industry association is normally a matter of routine, but not at the Indian Steel Association (ISA).

On May 19, the ISA appointed Dillip Oommen, the CEO of ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, as its president in an extraordinary board meeting. The circumstances were surely extraordinary.

The meeting had to be called after Tata Steel Managing Director & Global CEO TV Narendran had stepped down as the president on May 1, just a couple of months before the due end his tenure. It was probably the first time in the history of the association that a sitting president had stepped down.

Not just that. Tata Steel, the largest Indian steelmaker, also withdrew as a member of the Association, which plays a crucial role as a bridge between the industry and policymakers.

Narendran's resignation and Tata Steel's withdrawal point to a bitter divide among the industry players, say senior executives from the industry. ""It was Tata Steel on one side, and the rest of the members, on the other,"" is how one senior executive explained it.

Responding to a query from Moneycontrol, Tata Steel spokesperson said:

""Tata Steel has withdrawn its membership from the India Steel Association (ISA) owing to various considerations. Accordingly, Mr. T. V. Narendran, CEO & MD, Tata Steel, has stepped down from his position as the incumbent President, ISA.""

What were those considerations that prompted Narendran, and Tata Steel, to take the extreme step?

The all important mines

It all boiled down to one question:

What should be the association's response to the government's plan to advance the termination of captive mine leases to 2025 from 2030?

Tata Steel was against advancing the termination. On the other hand, the rest of the members, including JSW Steel, were for it, said a senior executive from the industry. Public sector company, SAIL and ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel - earlier Essar Steel - are also part of the ISA.

It is a crucial issue for the Indian steel sector. And, it is not difficult to see why Tata Steel was against the move.

The company's very foundation and legacy are tied to the discovery of iron ore in India. It was the discovery of the raw material in the eastern part of India, that led Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Group, to set up India's first steel company.

For over a century, Tata Steel made the most of that first-mover advantage. The company, along with SAIL, were the only steelmakers in the country to have captive iron ore. The rest, including JSW Steel and Essar Steel, had to buy the all important raw material used in steelmaking, from the open market.

But, things changed when the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act (MMDR Act) was amended in 2015. Consequently, by the beginning of 2020, points out a research note by CRISIL, mines with more than 640 million tons of iron ore have been auctioned in three years.

Moreover, earlier in 2020, the government proposed to terminate the captive mine leases by 2025, instead of the original timeline of 2030.

Tata Steel, which meets all its iron ore requirements from captive mines, will be the most hit. Not just that it will have to compete with the likes of JSW Steel - whose founder Sajjan Jindal has aggressively bid till now - and the bids have been extremely high. JSW Steel, for instance, will pay a premium of over Rs 130, for every Rs 100 of ore it produces from the mines in Odisha.

At rates as high as this, Tata Steel will lose its traditional advantage and its profitability will take a dent. For Narendran, whose second term at the helm gets over in 2023, maintaining the company's traditional advantage will be one his biggest priorities.",643,0.1013076560837882

There is also a need to work aggressively to attract foreign investment into India and focus once again on the Make in India programme. This crisis can and should be converted into an opportunity, he said.

When asked whether players also expect some relief in duty cut on raw materials, Narendran said the government can play a vital role in helping the industry as import duties on any raw material particularly metallurgical coal, which is not available in India and has to be imported, just add to the cost of doing business and reduces the competitiveness of the Indian industry.

Speaking on the impact of the lockdown, the CEO further said in the initial days, the challenge was to keep the plants running even at lower utilisation levels. The construction industry, which is a steel consuming sector, was also significantly impacted. The steel industry was dependent on export markets for orders.

""However, over the last few days we are starting to see some pick-up in domestic consumption as some of our customers have got permissions to start work. I can see a revival of some activity as more contracts are being awarded and more sites are getting permission to operate.

""Also, the best thing the government can do to revive the economy is to accelerate the spending on infrastructure. It not only allows money to flow back into the economy, but also creates employment opportunities for semi-skilled workers across the country and also helps bring down the cost of doing business through better infrastructure.

""We are a capital-intensive industry with significant fixed costs and so operating at less than optimal capacity is not ideal for us. I expect the steel demand to pick up post lockdown as construction and industrial activities will pick up. It may take two or three quarters to come back to normal,"" he said.

The industry veteran also cautioned that there will be a need to check imports in post lockdown period as some countries may try to dump in their products into India taking the undue advantage of the situation.

""We need to be watchful on imports so that we don't become a dumping ground for other countries. To be fair to China, so far, we have not had a problem and in fact India is now exporting steel to China. But we are also watchful about Japan and Korea as over the last few years the problem has been of exports from Japan and Korea to India rather than from China to India,"" the CEO said.

To a question related to the impact of COVID-19 on steel companies' expansion plans, he said ""while in the long run India can and should have a large and healthy steel industry because it is blessed with raw materials and a growing market, in the short and medium term the focus should be to restore the financial health of the industry.""

""So, I would assume for the next two to three years the focus will be more on deleveraging over growth and then as the financial health of the industry improves, we can look at growth again,"" he added.

Another steel consuming sector auto has also been impacted due to the lockdown.

He said the auto industry has been significantly impacted and all auto customers of the company were closed till recently. Some of them have now got permission to operate their plants but they are also struggling to get their inbound supply chain and vendor ecosystem to operate.

""They also need to see their dealerships open and liquidate inventories already in the system. On the one hand, they may get impacted by people postponing discretionary purchases but on the other hand we may have people moving from public transport and shared vehicles to own vehicles to reduce the risk of exposure to the pandemic,"" he added.

As the government focuses on construction and infrastructure, a pick-up in demand for commercial vehicles may be seen. ""But I think we are in for a few challenging quarters,"" he said.

Speaking on the company's Europe operations, he said Europe is not under a complete lockdown and hence Tata Steel has been operating at about 70 per cent of the normal levels there.

""We see the activity starting to pick up again after Easter. In South East Asia, till recently we did not have a lockdown in Singapore and so were fairly normal apart from the usual slowdown due to the current context. Thailand plants are still operating but demand conditions are weak due to the pandemic,"" Narendran added.",989,-0.16473238959031947

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Tata Sons declined to comment when approached by The Economic Times.

""European steel demand has sharply reduced compared to normal conditions and many of our customers paused production, including European car manufacturers. We, therefore, reduced production at some of our European mills to match this lower demand. Our European business is focused on preserving cash and liquidity to tide it over during the challenging period,"" a Tata Steel spokesperson told the publication.

The UK government might provide only one-fifth of the cost required, sources told the paper.

Media reports suggest Tata Steel has sought 500 million pounds (Rs 4,750 crore) from the UK government.

On April 13, Tata Steel's board approved a plan to raise as much as Rs 7,000 crore through non-convertible debentures (NCDs).

Tata Steel, which owns the UK's largest steelworks in Port Talbot in Wales, is holding discussions with the Welsh government as well as the UK Treasury as it seeks the GBP 50-million cap set on loans being offered under the UK's Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS) to be lifted.

""We continue to have ongoing discussions with Tata Steel about what support it needs to sustain a strong steel making presence in the UK and in Wales,"" a Welsh government spokesperson said.

The Indian steel major employs 8,385 people in the UK, including about 4,000 people in Port Talbot and 2,800 in other parts of Wales.

""We continue to work with both the UK and Welsh governments to identify what support is available,"" a company statement said.

According to ‘Sky News', the support sought is largely understood to comprise a commercial loan that would be repayable when demand for steel recovers.

The GBP 500-million figure is said to be a ""ballpark"" estimate of the company's funding need.

""The GBP 50 million cap on loans that are now available under the government support scheme is only about 10 per cent of what Tata Steel actually needs,"" said Opposition Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, whose constituents make up much of the steel workforce in Port Talbot.

""Tata Steel estimates that it will take around six months to get back to business as usual, or as close as possible to it and the challenge they have is cashflow over that six month period. And the estimation is in the region of GBP 500 million,"" said Kinnock, who had also raised the issue in the House of Commons earlier this week.

Responding to him, First Secretary of State Dominic Raab, who is standing in for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson while he recuperates, said that UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak is looking “carefully” at the steel sector.

Tata Steel Ltd (TSL) on Wednesday said its consolidated sales fell by over 11 percent to 7 million tonne (MT) during March quarter 2020 as compared to the year-ago period, hit by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.

The consolidated production during the quarter increased by over 1.5 percent to 7.84 MT from 7.72 MT in January-March 2019, TSL said in a statement.

In the just concluded quarter, TSL's India sales were at 4.03 MT, down from 4.72 MT in the year-ago period, while the output increased to 4.74 MT from 4.48 MT.

The company's sales in Europe fell to 2.37 MT from 2.57 MT in the year-ago period, while production also fell to 2.56 MT from 2.73 MT.

Tata Steel South East Asia registered almost flat sales at 0.60 MT compared to 0.59 MT in January-March 2019, while the output was at 0.54 MT, marginally up from 0.51 MT in the same quarter a year ago.

""As per notifications from central and state governments, steel and mining, being essential services and continuous process industries, are exempt from the lockdown measures subject to certain guidelines.

However, the lockdown has led to logistic issues and lower demand driven by the shutdown of customer operations in automotive, construction and other segments since last few days of March 2020.

""While this affected 4QFY20 sales volumes in India, production volume grew. . Tata Steel India also achieved an 8 percent y-o-y production growth for full year FY20, along with the best ever annual sales,"" the company said in a statement.

This was supported by ramp up of Tata Steel BSL and acquisition of Usha Martin Steel business by Tata Steel Long product. Tata Steel BSL also recorded its best ever annual performance, it said.

In Europe also, the company said, it is cooperating with national guidelines of the relevant countries to combat COVID-19.

S&P Global Ratings on Wednesday said it has lowered its ratings outlook on Tata Steel as the agency does not foresee any improvement in the steel maker's earnings and financial profile over the next 12-18 months.

The outlook reflects risks of further weakening in Tata Steel's credit profile if the effect of economic conditions and lower commodity prices are more prolonged than our current expectations, S&P Global Ratings said in a statement.

The agency lowered its long-term foreign-currency issuer credit rating on Tata Steel and subsidiary ABJA Investment Co. Pte. Ltd., and the issue rating on various US-dollar denominated senior unsecured notes ABJA has issued, to 'B+' from 'BB-'.

""The downgrade mainly reflects our expectation that the improvement in Tata Steel's earnings and financial profile, on which the 'BB-' rating was based, is unlikely to materialise in the next 12-18 months.

Even before recent developments, the agency said, Tata Steel's earnings in the first nine months of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, had underperformed its expectations.

However, meaningful price hikes between December 2019 and March 2020, together with a seasonally stronger January-March quarter meant there was still potential for the company's financial profile to improve, but now S&P Global Ratings sees this as unlikely.

""(Instead) We see a more significant impact on Tata Steel's credit profile coming from its higher cost European operations,"" it said.

While both the company's Europe plants (in the UK and the Netherlands) are still running, they are doing so at significantly reduced capacity. ""In our base case, we assume depressed volumes for at least one quarter, followed by a recovery to more normal levels,"" it noted.

The agency further said it could lower the rating on Tata Steel if the company's credit profile remains pressured for longer than current expectations.

The outlook would be revised back to stable only if the impact of the economic slowdown is less than our current expectation, it said.

Facing reduction in demand due to the lockdown in the country, steel makers SAIL and Tata Steel have reduced their output by about 50 per cent, according to sources.

State-owned Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) and private player Tata Steel both contribute about 20 per cent to India's total steel production. As per industry sources, SAIL and Tata Steel have scaled down production by about 50 per cent.

The companies have taken the decision because of the reduced demand in the market after the lockdown, which has impacted logistics movement, the sources said adding that buyers are also reluctant in placing orders.

Most of the staff of the companies are working from home and only important sites like blast furnaces and coke oven batteries etc at the plants, which can not be closed, are running.

Advisory for stakeholders

Importantly, the steelmaker has asked its vendor partners to avoid coming to its premises.

""All visitor gate passes, physical meetings, non-essential plant visits, non-essential visits to Procurement, Finance & Accounts and any other agency need to be minimised and done using digital platforms like Phone, Email, Video Conferencing,"" the company said.

The Nifty Metal index fell about 10 percent during the January 31-March 3 perid, largely impacted by the global volatility due to Coronavirus which has led to the destruction in demand. But there is still a silver lining for Tata Steel and JSW Steel.

“While being conscious of the near-term demand destruction emanating from Coronavirus, we see the supportive environment for metals from 2HCY21 on the back of expected Chinese stimulus, credit impulse, and global liquidity support,” Ambit Capital said in a report.

“We see global and domestic mill utilization scaling up through FY22, supporting spreads. Both Tata Steel (TSL) and JSW Steel (JSW) should generate >20% EBIDTA CAGR through FY22E,” said the report.

As an early cycle, metal, steel stand to benefit the most from Chinese infrastructure spend. Global cyclical recovery and re-stocking should provide added support. On the valuations front, peak earnings in FY22, 10-15% is below expectations.

Ambit has initiated a buy call on Tata Steel with a target of Rs 550 which translates into an upside of over 40 percent from March 3 closing level of Rs 387 on the BSE. It is also Amibit’s top pick on steeper Indian cost curve post

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

JSW Steel is also a buy call with a target of Rs 350 which translates into an upside of another 40 percent from March 3 closing level of Rs 245 on the BSE.

India Entering Sweet Spot:

India entering sweet spot as capacity additions to lag demand growth. Capacity additions in India through FY23E should underwhelm given: a) no material greenfield expansion and b) majors have expanded capacity through stressed asset acquisition.

“Even assuming 4.9 percent CAGR steel demand growth through FY23, compared to 5.7 percent CAGR in the previous 5 years, we expect incremental capacity additions to lag demand growth through FY23, suggesting reduced dependence on exports for volume growth,” said the note.

Ambit forecasts utilization approaching 86 percent on an effective basis by FY23E (vs 82% in FY20E), driving profitability.

Valuations:

Both Tata Steel and JSW Steel provide significant earnings growth through cycle. Ambit’s FY21E estimates for Tata Steel and JSW Steel are 10 percent below consensus on conservatism around demand destruction, but a quick V-shaped recovery could provide upside to our expectations.

“We anticipate stronger growth in FY22, with EBITDA estimates 3-5% above consensus. Both Tata Steel and JSW should generate >20% EBITDA growth through FY22, TSL on operating leverage and JSW on higher Dolvi volumes. Current valuations suggest peak earnings in FY22 10-15% below our expectations,” said the note.

Ambit sees Tata Steel as trading stock, while JSW Steel as a long-term play. Risks to the thesis include greater and longer than expected impact from Coronavirus, shallower than anticipated Chinese stimulus spending, and lower Indian steel demand growth necessitating higher dependence on exports.

Maharashtra police on February 26 raided a retail outlet in the Vasai area of Palghar district of the state for selling counterfeit barbed wire under the brand name 'Tata Wiron'.

Tata Steel, in a press release dated February 28, said its officials conducted the raid with the help of the state police. It added that the counterfeit product was being sold with photocopied Tata Wiron labels attached to it.

Around 26 bundles of the fake barbed wire were seized by the team. These were reportedly being procured by the retailer from manufacturers in a nearby district. The retailer attached the fake labels at his outlet and sold the goods at a considerably lower price as compared to that of the original Tata Wiron barbed wire product.

The company, in the statement, said, ""Tata Steel will continue to actively pursue these efforts in monitoring and acting against any such illegal activities which are impacting its assets and the brand.""

Metals stocks took a beating on February 24, correcting 1-7 percent as the number of infected from China's coronavirus continued to rise spreading to other countries as well.

The Nifty Metal index fell nearly 4 percent, the biggest loser among sectoral indices.

Jindal Steel & Power, Vedanta, JSW Steel, SAIL, Hindalco, Tata Steel, Hindustan Copper, NALCO, MOIL, NMDC, Coal India, Welspun Corp and APL Apollo Tubes were down 1-7 percent.

China, which is the largest consumer and supplier of several commodities including metals, has been fighting with novel coronavirus more than a month now. The virus has already taken lives of over 2,600 with more than 77,000 infected cases in the world's second-largest economy.

The most worrisome part is that the novel coronavirus called COVID-19 has now spread to nearly 25 countries with South Korea witnessing the biggest spike in infected cases. Other countries such as Japan, Philippines, Hong Kong, Australia are also seeing a rise in the number of coronavirus cases.

The worst affected remains China where thousands of factories were shut down putting millions of lives on hold. Even though some of the factories have reopened, analysts remain cautious about the progress at these factories/plants.

The International Monetary Fund's Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the spread of China's coronavirus outbreak to more than 25 countries could put global economic recovery at risk.

""China is not a major trade partner of India with regards to metals but its sheer size and global market share would impact pricing and profitability of various global commodities and indirectly impact Indian metal companies,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities.

China's commodity consumption and export dominance have increased exponentially in the past two decades. In 2003, China accounted for just 20-22 percent of global commodity production. However, over the past 17 years, China's share in world demand and production has increased to around 50 percent.

""Base metal demand has taken a bigger hit than supply in China due to the COVID-19 issue. China is a net exporter of aluminium and a net importer of zinc. This would suggest a greater impact on zinc global market balance than for aluminium. However, the food and beverage industry is impacted significantly and 11 percent of domestic aluminium demand is linked to the F&B industry. Thus, the supply-demand imbalance could worsen in the case of both aluminium and zinc,"" Kotak said.

India is the net exporter of both aluminium and zinc. Domestic and export prices both are directly linked to LME prices and have been under pressure due to potential increase in global surplus led by China (and global) slowdown, it added.

Among the base metal Indian companies, Nalco's earnings have the highest sensitivity to metal prices followed by Vedanta, Hindustan Zinc and Hindalco, the brokerage feels.

China consumes two-thirds of global traded iron ore. Out of total 1.5 billion tons of traded iron ore, 1 billion is consumed by China.

""Thus, lower imports by China have already resulted in surplus outside China and significant pressure on iron ore prices. Weak iron ore prices will impact merchant miners such as NMDC while cost deflation would benefit steel companies,"" Kotak said.

China is a net steel exporter (50 million tons annually or 6 percent of ex-China demand).

""China demand has been impacted more than supply, resulting in higher domestic inventory and pressure on domestic prices. Weak domestic steel prices in China and lower iron ore prices outside China have started impacting steel prices outside China too,"" said Kotak.

""Domestic steel prices in India are driven by import-parity pricing and should come under pressure with a lag of 30-45 days. Lower steel prices directly impact earnings of all steel producers. Margin impact would be partially offset by cost deflation from lower iron ore prices, if any,"" it added.

Kotak feels among the four major steel companies (JSPL, JSTL, SAIL and TATA), earnings of SAIL and Tata Steel are more sensitive to steel prices at they are more integrated in their operations followed by JSPL and JSTL.

Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentous oscillator used to identify trend reversal. It was invented by Welles Wilder Junior.

The default look-back period for RSI is 14, however, this can be lowered to increase sensitivity or raised to decrease sensitivity. RSI calculates the strength of a stock trend and helps to predict their reversals.

Why buy Tata Steel?

There are a lot of trading strategies using RSI; below mentioned is one of the most popular among the trading community. It involves buy after completing retracement for higher movement; however the support of another momentum oscillator stochastic can give additional support.

In past few days, RSI gave a breakout by trading above 50 levels from below and made a high of 75 then after it is trading lower or retracing towards centre line placed at 50 levels, this behaviour is called as 'RSI PBB' setup. RSI PBB is pull back buy setup which indicates, once RSI turns its tail upside after taking support from zone of 45-55 levels, target is previous swing high of RSI which was 75 or previous swing high of prices (Rs 505).

Currently, Tata Steel is going through this setup and we expect higher price movement towards previous high Rs 500-520 levels in coming days.

Figure .1. RSI PBB setup and Buy signal on Tata Steel

Buy Signal





Recent RSI gave a breakout and published swing top around 75 levels.



After marking high of 75, RSI is retracing towards 50 towards mid-line standing around 50 mark.

Decent volume participation while forming a bullish candle will also give additional confirmation.



Whenever price candle will be near previous swing high which is near Rs 500-520 levels.

Stop Loss

Entire bullish view negates on breaching of a swing low and one should exit from a long position. In the case of Tata Steel, it is standing around Rs 384 mark.

Conclusion

We recommend buying Tata Steel around Rs 420-430 levels with a stop loss of Rs 384 for higher targets of Rs 500 and Rs 520 levels as indicated in the above chart.

Tata Steel has cut 800 jobs in its European unit as part of a 'transformation program' that intends to make the operations in the continent cash positive.

The company in 2019 announced its intention to shed 3,000 of its Europe workforce. It had added that about two-thirds of the cuts are expected to be office-based ('white-collar') roles. Tata Steel employs close to 20,000 people in Europe.

""We have, since the beginning of the year, reduced our workforce by 800 already. There are obviously some difficult discussions going on as well because it's never easy to reduce the workforce, and we've done a lot of that in the past as well,"" said Tata Steel Global CEO and Managing Director TV Narendran.

The unions are unhappy about the plans. European Works Council (EWC), had last year said 'employees should not pay the price for Tata's failures' despite the challenges that the company is facing due to the current economic slowdown. They had even threatened to go on strike or approach the European Parliament.

Tata Steel had announced the transformation program in 2019, after its plan to merge European operations to the steel unit of German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp, was blocked by the European Commission.

Reducing workforce was one of four transformation areas, ""to ensure the business can thrive despite severe market headwinds which have led to a sharp decline in profitability,"" the steelmaker had said in November.

The other three, the company had then said, are:





Increasing sales of higher-value steels by improving product mix and customer focus;



Efficiency gains by optimising production processes, supported by the application of big data and advanced analytics;



Reduction of procurement costs through smarter sourcing and strengthening cooperation with companies within the Tata Steel group.

Narendran though talked about ""five workstreams,"" and each will lead to a saving of up to 150 million Euros.

""If it (the transformation program) progresses as it has so far and continues for the next 12 months and the spreads come to around Euros 220-odd levels next year, then I think we will be cash positive for next year,"" Narendran said.

The 'spread' right now is at about Euros 180, a far cry from the Euros 270-280 levels a year ago.

Much of the program's success would hinge on how the company performs in the last quarter of the present financial year, and in the next fiscal. The recent third-quarter results were not a happy read.

Tata Steel on Friday said that its production volume in India registered a marginal 1.8 per cent increase to 4.46 million tonnes (provisional) in the third quarter of the ongoing fiscal. Its production volume was at 4.38 MT (actual) in the year-ago period, the steel major said in a filing to BSE.

Tata Steel India's sales volume in the third quarter of the ongoing fiscal increased by 17 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) with improved market sentiment.

Sales volume to auto segment was maintained during the quarter, it said.

The branded product and retail segment grew 23 per cent QoQ, while industrial products and projects grew 12 per cent QoQ.

""Tata Steel Europe's 3QFY20 production and sales volume was flattish on QoQ basis. Tata Steel South East Asia operations registered lower production volume QoQ due to continued sluggishness in Singapore and Thailand markets,"" it said.

The Indian economy, it said, remained weak with declining private consumption growth and low investment growth.

Domestic steel prices reached a nadir in October 2019 before improving from November onwards.

Steel prices are expected to improve with strong retail demand and ongoing restocking demand at the dealers' ends, it said.

The chairman of the Tata group N Chandrasekaran has said the steel conglomerate cannot have a situation where India keeps funding the mounting losses at its struggling Port Talbot steelworks in the UK. He emphasised that the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales, one of the largest in Europe, needed to be ""self-sustaining"" in an interview with the Sunday Times.

The head of the 84 billion-pound turnover conglomerate that also owns British luxury automaker Jaguar Land Rover, refused to commit to continuing to make UK steel, the report said.

Chandrasekaran, 56, said, ""I need to get to a situation where at least the plant (Port Talbot) is self-sustaining.""

""Whether it is in the Netherlands or here, we can't have a situation where India keeps funding the losses just to keep it going,"" he told the British newspaper.

Tata Steel's pre-tax losses were 371 million pounds last year, up from 222 million pounds in 2017-18. In November, Tata announced plans to cut 3,000 jobs across Europe.

Just under half of Tata's 8,385-strong UK workforce are based in Port Talbot, the BBC reported on Sunday.

Paul Evans, the Unite labour union's regional officer for Wales, said: ""This interview just adds more pressure on the Tata workers at Port Talbot. The site is obviously key to the future of the other Tata plants in Wales.

""The workforce at Port Talbot have for many years proved they are the producers of world class quality steel and Wales and the UK can't afford to lose the expertise and commitment they have shown over the years.""

A spokesman for Tata Steel's European operations said: ""What our chairman said in the interview has already been communicated to colleagues through our transformation programme.

""That programme is about building a stronger and more sustainable European steel business by improving profitability so we can pay for investments necessary to secure our long-term future,"" the BBC report quoted the company spokesman as saying.

""The plans include productivity improvements, reduced bureaucracy and increased sales of higher-value steels, as well as employment cost savings,"" he added.

The chief executive officer and managing director of Tata Steel, T V Narendran has suggested to the government to focus on ""cost of business"" to make industries, particularly the manufacturing sector, more competitive.

""As the government has focused on ease of doing business, it should also focus on 'cost of business' to make industries, particularly the manufacturing sector, more competitive in the prevailing market,"" Narendran told reporters on Wednesday.

""We have been controlling the cost of business inside the work but outside the plant, it is not in our hands but the Central and state governments,"" the Tata Steel CEO said.

He said that such an initiative would certainly improve competitiveness of the domestic industries, particularly the manufacturing units.

Referring to the prevailing scenario in the steel sector, Narendran said that 2019 had been a difficult year for the steel sector and ""the Tata Steel is not an exception as we have our own set of challenges to deal with"".

However, Narendran said, ""We have seen some signs of improvement in the last few months of 2019, which reflected with improved demand of steel shot up a bit and steel prices going up again.""

He said that the steel prices almost shot up to Rs 10,000 per tonne during the last six to eight months.

As far as development of the steel city of Tatanagar is concerned, he said that the Tata Steel has not slowed down investment despite difficult times of the company, demonstrating the companys commitment.

Narendran urged the city to make sacrifices to make the company sustainable, profitable and competitive.

He expressed confidence that the company will improve its performance in the last quarter (January-March) of the current fiscal as 'demand of steel is okay'.

The January to June months would be favourable for the steel sector in view of the activities in construction and infrastructure sectors, he said.

Commenting on the prevailing economic slowdown, he said. April to October had been the worst period for the steel sector, which has started looking up from November.

""We are expecting to perform well in the last quarter of the current fiscal,"" he said, adding the government has also taken various decision such as cut in corporate taxes and the recent announcement of investment in infrastructure sector.",388,0.02996949851512909

The Nifty Auto index gave a breakout from the falling trendline on the daily chart and sustaining well above the same, which is a positive sign for the auto counters, Chandan Taparia, Equity Derivatives & Technical research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Q) Indian market closed on a muted note with slight negative bias snapping two straight weeks of gains. How is the first week of January likely to pan out for investors?

A) The Nifty50 index kick-started the January derivatives series on a positive note as it opened with an upside gap and continued to make higher highs throughout the session.

Eventually, the index concluded the session a tad below 12,250 level and formed a positive candle on the daily chart. However, we witnessed a Doji candle on the weekly chart of Nifty.

It moved within the territory of penultimate week’s range and thus formed an Inside Bar pattern on the weekly chart, indicating indecisiveness among the market participants.

The Nifty breached lower highs and lower lows sequence of the last three sessions and till the time, it sustains above its support of 12,100, we maintain a positive stance on the market for an up move towards 12,350, and then towards 12,400 levels.

Q) What does the rollover data suggest for the January series? Which stocks and sectors saw strong rollovers?

A) The Nifty50 witnessed a rollover of 70.44 percent with a roll cost of 0.50 percent as compared to the previous month roll of 79.64 percent.

The index closed the December series with the marginal losses of (0.20 percent) on expiry to expiry basis. Bank Nifty closed the December series with the marginal losses (0.39 percent) on expiry to expiry basis but witnessed a higher rollover of 78.46 percent compared to the last month of 70.56 percent.

The Nifty started the January series with an open interest of 12.26 million shares compared to 14.70 million shares at the start of December series, OI remained lower on the month on month basis as some position was liquidated.

Rollover data suggest that index has seen lower rolls compared to its quarterly average of 78.66 percent and both the indices are light on positions.

Thus, a fresh build-up in the coming days will decide further trends for the January series. However, overall data setup suggests undertone of the market is bullish and we maintain our buy on dips strategy till Nifty holds above its crucial support of 11,950- 12,000 zones.

On the sectoral indices front, we saw long positions getting formed and healthy rollovers in heavyweights NBFC and metal space; while shorts were seen in the capital goods and cement sectors.

Stocks like Motherson Sumi, Tata Steel, Muthoot Finance, Kotak Bank and Hindalco witnessed a good amount of long rollovers.

While Yes Bank, BHEL, Voltas, LIC Housing Finance, and Sun TV remained under pressure in December series along with decent short formations.

Q) Auto sales numbers will be an important data point which the Street will be watching out for. Do you see a recovery in December sales?

A) The Nifty Auto index gave a breakout from the falling trendline on the daily chart and sustaining well above the same, which is a positive sign for the auto counters.

From the auto and auto ancillary space -- Bajaj Auto, Maruti Suzuki, and Motherson Sumi are our preferred picks for the coming week.

Q) Any 3 stocks which you think are still good buy on dips stocks for 3-4 weeks?

A) Considering the overall chart structure, we advise traders to buy ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, PVR and Manappuram Finance on declines for the coming month.

Shares of Tata Steel climbed over a percent on BSE in early trade on December 26 and looked on course to extend their winning run into the seventh session in a row.

The scrip has been on a gaining spree after reports emerged that the company may announce restructuring of the domestic business to unlock value.

The Tata Group company may look at restructuring listed companies Tata Metaliks and Tata Sponge which both may be named Tata Steel Long Products, sources said, adding the company may look at restructuring Tinplate in future.

On December 17, Citi had upgraded Tata Steel to 'buy' from 'sell', as the global financial firm expects global steel prices to rise.

""We are expecting global steel prices to rise on the greater likelihood of China easing and potential demand upside in the rest of the world and India.

The Bombay House plunged into uncertainty after the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal reinstated Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons. The decision came a year after Mistry challenged in NCLAT a National Company Law Tribunal’s order.

NCLAT has termed Mistry’s removal and N Chandrasekaran’s appointment as the Chairman of Tata Sons in February 2017 - illegal. The reinstatement is supposed to happen within four weeks of the decision. The new year could thus bring in a new chairman.

This year had not been so good for the $110-billion group either. Tata Motors and Tata Steel witnessed a decline following a lack of positive cues on the global as well as the domestic front, though TCS and Tata Global Beverages seemed to be on a much stable path.

A change in the management will mean a change in the manner of operating; making things more complicated. These complexities will most likely mean a slowdown in taking decisions and an increase in the gap between board members in the initial stages of implementation. The result of this boardroom battle will increase pressure on the stock prices.

What one also has to keep in mind is that if Tata Sons decide to move to the Supreme Court, the matter and the seat will be tied up for the next three years at least. This will create a blanket of stress for the stocks, with global operations and prices taking a hit in the days to follow.

However, the precariousness associated should not hold them back from making a positive run in the long term. For a mid to long-term view, we expect that Tata Group’s stocks will see a rise and align themselves with the overall positive outlook for the index.

The reason for this is rooted in the thought that in the long run, the shareholders will appreciate the improvements in transparency, which in turn will reconfirm the values that the Tata Group has always stood for.

A positive outlook is expected as the investors will likely shift their focus to the fundamentals rather than simply attaching sentiment to the NCLAT’s decision.

Share prices of Tata Steel, JSW Steel and SAIL gained 3-4 percent intraday on December 17 after Citi upgraded ratings on these stocks, citing likely increase in global steel prices.

The global brokerage house upgraded Tata Steel and JSW Steel (from sell) to buy, and SAIL to neutral.

""We are expecting global steel prices to rise on the greater likelihood of China easing and potential demand upside in Rest of World and India. Further volatility in margins should ease as China's supply additions would end in 2020, and we don't expect a sharp deceleration in China demand at least until the mid-decade,"" Citi said.

China steel demand has run ahead of expectations in 2019, whereas the Rest of the World has disappointed (-2 percent YTD). Margins had hit a low (since FY16) in Q2FY20, but have rebounded since then on low China inventories and ex-China curtailments.

While China's future demand remains a wildcard (resilient near term), the key takeaways from the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) on December 10-12 (the CEWC expressed monetary policy stance as prudent, but added that the policy should be flexible and appropriate) and the PBoC's recent 5bp cut of the 7-day RRR raise the probability of government easing, Citi said.

With 2020 an election year in the US, the brokerage expects positive policies for global trade/growth.

India's steel demand has likely been flat/down YTD. Steel prices fell below the anti-dumping floor briefly in October 2019. After a trough of Rs 34,500 per tonne (and the end of the destocking cycle), domestic prices have been hiked by around 4 percent through November/December (now at import parity). The import parity price has also increased.

""We think India's demand will rebound from the trough and thus we incorporate further upside to steel prices. Our average hot-rolled coil (HRC) price expectation for FY21 is flat against FY20 at Rs 38,000 per tonne (spot Rs 36,000 per tonne),"" Citi said.

With the Conservative Party winning the UK elections, the odds are in favour of Brexit. This is going to revive the metals and automobile sectors of India, so a Santa Claus rally is on the cards in December, Kaushlendra Singh Sengar, Founder of Advisorymandi.com tells Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.



Q: Indian market closes the week with gains of over 1%, and above 12,000 levels. Do you think the week macro data could spoil the party for bulls?

A: The recent disclosure of Industrial Production and Manufacturing output data from the Indian Ministry of Statistics has spooked investors. But if someone conducts an intra-comparison of the data, we could devise that while negative, compared to previous quarters it does signal strong revival in the consumption story of India.

Moreover, the reduction in corporate tax is going to push the total GDP of the country and its effects will be witnessed from the new year, which will leave corporate houses with more liquidity for disposal.

Q: Do you think we could see a Santa Claus rally probably towards the close of the year 2019?

A: Convincing statements from the United States and China's administrations in regards to the ‘phase one’ trade deal is going to unlock the untapped potential of both economies.

Moreover, with the Conservative Party winning the UK elections, the odds are in favour of Brexit. This is going to revive the metals and automobile sectors of India, so a Santa Clause rally is on the cards in December.

Q: The recent macro indicators cement fears of a slowdown. Do you think investors could say goodbye to a 25 bps rate cut in February?

A: The recent statement from Home Minister Amit Shah on ‘reviving the fears of slowdown whatever it takes’ provides cues of deploying every possible tool to curb the slowdown.

Hence, a decision of 25 basis rate cut in February will remain a backup if it is required. However, the cumulative reduction of repo rate by 140 basis points this year has left little or no room for further deduction in repo rate.

Any further rate cut by RBI in order to leak more stimuli in the economy is going to be the last resort for the administration.

Q: Any big factors which investors should watch out for the coming week or important levels?

A: Headlines on the US-China trade deal is going to capture the sight of the market participants in the coming week. The continuation of complicated statements from the US administration will continue to keep investors on tenterhooks.

However, a ‘fit and proper’ close of a trade deal between the two dragon economies is going to delight the global and Asian markets.

Q: Which stocks according to you are displaying signs of a breakout?

A) Tata Elxsi, Motherson Sumi, and Tata Steel.

Tata Steel on Monday said it has introduced a new human resource policy that enables its employees from the LGBTQ+ community to declare their partners and avail all HR benefits permissible under the law.

With its vision to provide equal opportunity to the employees, it has been an endeavour of the company to create an enabling workforce for all diverse groups, respecting and embracing the differences in the individuals, the steel maker said in a statement.

""Partners mean people of same-sex living like a married couple,"" it said.

LGBTQ+ refers to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning and related communities.

Under the expanded diversity and inclusion (D&I) policy, Tata Steel employees and their partners will be able to avail a host of benefits including health check-up, medical facilities, adoption leave, new-born parent and child care leave, and inclusion in employee assistance programme (EAP).

Employees will also get financial assistance for gender reassignment surgery and 30 days special leave for the same, the steel maker said.

Metals stocks rallied 1-3 percent on November 28 amid likely hike in prices and positive vibes from US-China trade talks.

JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Jindal Steel & Power, SAIL etc gained 1-3 percent with Nifty Metal index itself rising around a percent.

The Metal index has been on buyers' radar this week, up 4.5 percent in the current week and around 8 percent in a month especially after rising hope that trade deal between world's largest economies US and China could be signed next month.

China remains a vital market for steel production and export.

In addition, Indian companies are likely to hike prices for both flat & long products in December by $7-15 per tonne, Credit Suisse said, adding October was the sixth monthly YoY decline of ex-China steel availability.

Tata Steel, JSPL and JSW Steel would benefit from a restocking as prices recover, the brokerage feels.

Domestic hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices, on average, have risen by Rs 265 per tonne this week with all the major markets reporting price hikes of Rs 200–500 per tonne. On the exports front as well, there is a respite as export price to Vietnam rose to $448 per tonne — the highest in past 2.5 months.

Edelweiss said going ahead, it sees further tailwinds as their channel checks indicate that: i) after a salubrious November, steel mills are again contemplating a price hike of Rs 500–1,000 per tonne in December 2019; and ii) some domestic companies have booked export orders for January 2020 at $470 per tonne (5 percent higher than current level).

However, spreads still remain in the lowest decile over the past five years though there is some respite from higher prices on the one hand and decline in coking coal prices on the other, it added.

Current domestic raw materials spread is up to $ 1,500 per tonne from the bottom at Rs 21,615 per tonne.

Post-price hikes, domestic HRC price are still about Rs 1,000 per tonne below the import parity level for South Korea and Japan. However, unlike China, South Korea and Japanese prices have not moved up—remaining static at $415 per tonne for the past six weeks.

""If the contemplated price hike in December materialises, it might lead to an influx of imports. Furthermore, in the absence of a tangible pickup in domestic demand, domestic flats producers such as Tata Steel and JSW Steel are resorting to higher exports,"" Edelweiss said.

In fact, India has been a next exporter for the past three months, and exports as a percentage of production have gone up to 12–13 percent from merely about 5 percent earlier.

Currently, Indian export prices for Vietnam (the largest export destination for India) are competitive; however, this might change if Japanese and South Korean export prices do not increase in tandem with global peers, said the brokerage.

After outperforming global peers in the past one month, the ferrous sector is at an interesting point, it feels. While the much-needed price hike has infused optimism, it believes the revival of domestic demand is critical to sustaining/improving margins.

Edelweiss maintained its buy call on JSPL and hold call on Tata Steel and JSW Steel. It retains reduce rating on SAIL.

Tata Steel Europe said it had begun consultations with the European Works Council (EWC) on Wednesday on restructuring plans for its business, which would include up to 3,000 job losses – 1,000 of which will be in the UK.

The job cuts had been announced by the Indian steel major last week as part of a wider transformation programme as it blamed ongoing losses and continued global headwinds faced by the steel industry.

“As part of the comprehensive set of proposals, Tata Steel Europe intends to lower employment costs,” the company statement said.

“This is expected to lead to an estimated reduction in employee numbers of up to 3,000, about two-thirds of which would be management and office-based roles. Up to 1,600 are expected in the Netherlands, 1,000 in the UK and 350 elsewhere in the world,” it said.

Tata Steel said it aims to build a financially strong and sustainable European business, able to make the investments required to accelerate innovation and the company's journey towards carbon-neutral steelmaking.

Tata Steel in Europe CEO, Henrik Adam, said: “I'm very proud to see the dedication of everyone in this business, determined to succeed even in the face of a very tough market. I also understand and appreciate colleagues' concerns about these proposals.

“Change creates uncertainty, but we cannot afford to stand still as a company – the world around us is changing fast and we have to adapt. Our strategy is to build a strong and stable European business, capable of making significant investments needed for a successful future.”

During the meeting this week, which marked the official start of the employee consultation process with the EWC workers' unions, Tata Steel Europe said it had shared initial proposals about its transformation programme, focused across three other key areas besides lowering employment costs to improve the company's financial performance.

Increasing sales of higher-value steels by improving product mix and customer focus; efficiency gains by optimising production processes, supported by the application of big data and advanced analytics; and reduction of procurement costs through smarter sourcing and strengthening cooperation with companies within the Tata Steel group are among the other key focus areas of the company's plans.

Tata Steel said it agreed with the EWC on a forward process and will meet again in the coming weeks to discuss further details, with employees and other stakeholders kept updated during the process.",408,0.6624199748039246

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) began an investigation in 2017 after receiving allegations of five companies colluding on bearings prices from 2009-2014 to pass higher raw material costs onto customers in the auto sector.

Bearings reduce friction in moving parts, helping smooth the operation of vehicles. India's bearings market is dominated by SKF and Schaeffler and is worth $1.3 billion, showed data from ICRA Research.

CCI's investigations arm, in a report dated May 6 which has not been made public, said it analysed company emails, call records and executive testimonies and concluded that SKF India, Schaeffler India, National Engineering Industries and Tata Steel's bearings division contravened antitrust law by discussing and agreeing prices.

SKF, the world's largest maker of ball-bearings, in a statement said it aided the investigation, and that ""we dispute any claim of wrongdoing on the part of SKF"".

Schaeffler did not respond to a request for comment. Tata Steel and National Engineering Industries - part of Indian conglomerate CK Birla Group - declined to comment beyond saying the CCI proceedings were confidential.

The investigations arm said it found no evidence against the fifth firm, ABC Bearings, part of US firm Timken Co , the report showed. ABC Bearings declined to comment.

The report also showed the investigations arm considered the collusion lasted through the financial year to March 2011 but found no evidence to indicate when it actually ended.

The four firms, ""through personal meetings of key persons, on two occasions shared the strategic information regarding their future efforts to seek price increase from"" auto sector companies, the investigations arm said in its 106-page report.

The CCI did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. A person with direct knowledge of the matter said senior CCI officials are reviewing the report and that the antitrust body is able to dispute the findings of its investigation arm.

The CCI can fine firms up to three times the profit made in each year of wrongdoing or 10% of revenue, whichever is higher.

In 2014, European Union antitrust regulators fined SKF, Schaeffler and three Japanese auto parts makers $1.3 billion for taking part in a bearings cartel from 2004 through 2011.

""INCENTIVE TO COLLUDE""

The investigation report showed the four companies controlled nearly 75 percent of the domestic bearings market in the period 2009-11 - a time when prices of steel, the key raw material in bearings, were fluctuating sharply.

The steep steel price volatility, the CCI's investigation arm said, provided the companies an ""incentive to collude"".

There was consensus among the firms ""to seek price increase of 12% and settle at 6 percent "" with tractor and automotive manufacturers. With motorbike makers, there was a consensus to seek a 10 percent price increase and settle at 4 percent, the report showed.

The investigation arm also said Schaeffler and National Engineering Industries told the CCI that employees had participated in discussions with competitors ""mainly to seek coordinated price increase of bearings"". It did not elaborate on when the companies disclosed discussions to the CCI.

During the probe, ABC Bearings, SKF and Tata Steel's bearings division told the CCI they had no evidence of such discussions, the report showed.

""The conduct of the parties has resulted in appreciable adverse effect on competition,"" the CCI investigation arm said in the report. ""The sharing of price information is particularly sensitive from the competition law perspective.""",596,-0.8642194072405497

Moody's Investors Service on Monday said that the cost rationalisation of Tata Steel's European operations is credit positive as it will support a turnaround in the private steel major's wholly-owned arm TSUKH's less profitable operations.

On November 18, Tata Steel outlined a programme to reduce costs and improve product mix at its European operations, which are held by wholly-owned subsidiary Tata Steel UK Holdings (TSUKH), Moody's Investors Service said in a statement.

""The planned cost rationalisation program is credit positive for both companies because it will support a turnaround in TSUKH's less profitable operations that have dragged on Tata Steel's consolidated credit quality,"" the statement said.

The European operations accounted for 35 per cent of Tata Steel's total shipments in the first half of FY20, but they generated only around 2.4 per cent of its reported consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).

Although the programme is credit positive and a continuation of the company's efforts to turnaround the European operations, a timely and meaningful improvement in performance is key, the credit rating agency said.

Sustained weakness in demand from Europe's steel-consuming sectors, global economic slowdown and increasing trade barriers cast downside risks to the pace of credit profile improvement.

Tata Steel's Indian operations are the cornerstone of the company's strong profitability because these operations are integrated into the production of key raw materials in steel making, which combats the country's slowing steel demand and declining end-product prices.

Sluggish economic growth with weak demand from automobile, manufacturing, property and construction industries have diminished steel demand in India and caused a decline in end-product prices in the first half.",280,0.42761944021497456

More trouble could be brewing for Tata Steel in Europe, where a job cut announcement has riled workers, especially at the Netherlands unit, prompting trade unions to consider approaching the European Parliament, and even an industrial action.

The company had on November 18 announced 3,000 job cuts across its operations in Europe. Half of the losses would be in the Netherlands unit, which has otherwise been the most profitable part of Tata Steel's operations in the continent.

The job cut is part of a 'transformation programme,' which the company said was needed to urgently make the European operations cash positive in what is becoming an increasingly difficult market. Apart from the Netherlands, Tata Steel has units in Wales and other parts of Europe.

But the announcement seems to have taken workers in the Netherlands and Britain by shock. ""The unions fear that the final number of job cuts may go higher,"" said an industry executive.

Union leaders, added another executive, are expected to make a presentation at the European Parliament on November 27. ""They will voice against the job cuts. After this, there would be a voting among workers on whether to opt for an industrial action,"" added the official.

If they do vote for it, the workers could go on an industrial action, another term for strike.

What has also angered the workers is the belief that Tata Steel's management is going against a promise of job guarantee until 2021. The guarantee was made after the planned joint venture with German steelmaker thyssenkrupp had to be dropped after it was blocked by the European Commission.

A Reuters report quoted President of Tata Steel's European works council Frits van Wieringen warning of ""a very serious confrontation in the Netherlands.""

In 2015, members of four unions had voted in favour of going on a strike against the management's decision to stop the British Steel Pension Scheme. The unions eventually suspended the proposed industrial action after the two sides agreed to changes in the pension scheme.

Tough market conditionsIn the second quarter, Tata Steel managed to hold on to profitability thanks to a tax write-back. Its consolidated revenue from operations fell 15.44 percent year-on-year to Rs 34,579.2 crore.

Globally, the industry has been facing a slump in demand and prices, even as raw material costs remain high.

The European operations have also suffered. ""In the first six months of the current fiscal (starting April), Tata Steel Europe reported a 90 percent drop in EBITDA to 31 million pounds,"" the company said in a statement.

It also underlined the challenging market environment: ""Stagnant EU steel demand and global overcapacity have been compounded by trade conflicts which have turned the European market into a dumping ground for the world’s excess steel capacity.""

The proposed transformation plan has Tata Steel Europe targeting a positive cash flow by FY21-end. ""It is also aiming for an EBITDA margin of around 10 percent throughout the market cycle. Based on FY19 revenue, this would equate to an EBITDA of 750 million pounds,"" the company said.

It's not just Tata Steel. ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker, also has been forced to shut plants, cut production and withdraw from acquisitions.

But none of this would calm the nerves of the Tata Steel's workforce in the continent.",555,-0.5468229701121649

Steelworkers in Britain and the Netherlands said they would fight Tata Steel's plans to cut up to 3,000 jobs across its European operations, as the sector wrestles with excess supply, weak demand and high costs.

Indian-owned Tata announced the cuts late on Monday as part of wider efforts to boost profitability in Europe, saying around half of the losses would be in the Netherlands and around two-thirds would be office-based roles.

Tata's announcement confirmed a number previously reported by Reuters.

In addition to its Dutch plant, Tata has a plant in Wales and downstream operations, including finished products, across Europe.

The group's quest to boost European profitability follows a decision by competition regulators in June to block a joint venture with Germany's Thyssenkrupp .

Unions in Britain and the Netherlands said that following the collapse of that deal, they had been given a jobs guarantee until 2021 and they would defend that.

President of Tata Steel's European works council Frits van Wieringen said it would take time to work out detail, but warned of ""a very serious confrontation in the Netherlands"".

""There is no justification whatsoever to cut over 1,500 jobs here, and it will be impossible to find any kind of compromise over that,"" he said.

Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the British steelworkers‘ union Community, said British workers would also be ""robustly defending"" the 2021 jobs agreement.

Tata on Monday said it was urgently seeking to increase sales of higher value products and improve efficiency, as well as reducing employment costs.

It has ruled out plant closures and said the aim was to shield Tata Steel Europe from challenges, such as weak demand, excess capacity and trade issues, and to become cash positive by the end of its financial year ending March 2021.

In the first six months of its financial year starting April 2019, Tata Steel Europe reported a 90% plunge in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).

European steelmakers largely blame China for the extent of a surplus in the market, while China, the world's biggest steel-producing country, says it has made its own deep cuts to capacity.

ArcelorMittal , the world's biggest steelmaker, has idled a series of plants across Europe. It is also in conflict with the Italian government over its attempt to walk away from a 2018 deal to buy Ilva, Europe's largest steel plant.

Britain's biggest steel factory, British Steel, went into compulsory liquidation in May and is subject to a provisional agreement to be sold to Chinese steelmaker Jingye.

The deal will require regulatory and foreign investment clearance from European jurisdictions, including the European Union.

Management solutions provider Stratbeans on Tuesday said it has partnered with Tata Steel to enhance employees' productivity with digital training solutions.

With a view to manage the entire learning and training process of its manufacturing workforce, Stratbeans is onboard to enable on-the-go learning for Tata Steel employees. One of the biggest benefits of Stratbeans learning management solutions (LMS) is that it creates a virtual learning environment that is identical for every learner, the company said in a statement.

""Stratbeans framed a step-by-step digital learning strategy for Tata Steel from Custom Content creation, Interactive Learning Videos to 3D Content Creation. Its state-of-the-art technology has been a key enabler for Tata Steel's workflow in many ways.

""It has provided Tata Steel with unlimited access to e-learning materials, the ability to keep track of learners' progress and ensure that they are meeting their performance milestones. Moreover, its power to completely do away with instructor's traveling costs, online training site rentals, and printed e-learning materials, altogether sets it apart from other players in the market,"" the statement said.

Learning, he said, is important across industries, however, what makes it crucial for a company like Tata Steel is that it involves huge equipment including both electrical and mechanical machines which are comparatively complicated to maintain and operate.

In May this year, the company, which has a gross debt of Rs 1.11 lakh crore as of end September, had announced plans to reduce the debt by another USD 1 billion and a capex plan of Rs 12,000 crore.

""During the September quarter, we repaid around 370 million euros and we will repay a similar amount in the early part of 2020. While we continue to work towards meeting the original target of reducing debt by USD 1 billion, but given the current market scenario we will have to relook at this target,"" chief financial officer Koushik Chatterjee told reporters while announcing the Q2 numbers, wherein it reported a 5.9 percent rise in net income, boosted by massive tax gains, but almost 17 percent dip in revenue.

After the plan to merge its European operations with Thyssenkrupp fell through earlier this year, which could have helped it reduce debt significantly, the company is focusing now on selling non-core assets and maintain free cash flows to service the debt, he said.

""We will not lose any opportunity to reduce gross debt. We are taking lots of steps to generate more internal capital and becoming profitable is one of such step. At the same time, we are also working on recalibrating our capex plans and managing our working capital,"" Chatterjee said.

The company had initially planned Rs 12,000 crore capex this fiscal, but has reduced it to around Rs 8,300 crore now. So far this year, the company has spent nearly Rs 4,900 crore, he added.

""We have a lot of work to do over the next six months. In Europe, we would look at containing debt. In a good year, USD 1 billion reduction looks feasible, but when you are in an unprecedented market with falling demand, arithmetically we may not reach that target, but we will look at all opportunities to reduce gross debt,"" Chatterjee added.

Its liquidity position stood at Rs 11,858 crore, comprising Rs 4,596 crore in cash/cash equivalents, and Rs 7,262 crore in undrawn bank lines. Gross debt stood at Rs 1,11,549 crore and net debt at Rs 1,06,952 crore.

During the quarter, the company has tied up USD 525 million in foreign currency loans which would help lengthen its debt maturity profile.

As a part of its capex recalibration plans, it has prioritised the cold roll mill complex and pellet plant in its Kalinganagar phase II expansion, which will allow for greater value addition and drive cost reduction, managing director TV Narendran said.

""We are also re-organizing our domestic footprint in four verticals to drive scale, synergies and simplification which will create additional value for our stakeholders,"" he said, adding to attain these objectives they are consolidating domestic subsidiaries into four verticals--long products, downstream, mining and infrastructure.

The company's standalone profit increased 17.44 percent YoY to Rs 3,837.81 crore in Q2FY20 due to tax writeback of Rs 1,949 crore during the quarter (against tax expenses of Rs 1,747.70 crore in Q2FY19).

Tata Steel is expected to report more than a 90 percent decline in its Q2 FY20 consolidated profit due to lower steel prices and headwinds in the auto sector, brokerages feel.

The drop in growth is likely to be seen across parameters such as consolidated revenue, which could see a fall of around 20 percent as compared to the year-ago period.

The company's domestic and European operations are expected to be impacted due to lower steel prices and the economic slowdown.

""Standalone EBITDA per tonne to be impacted by weak steel prices and higher share of exports. Volumes at Bhushan likely to improve but at the cost of realisation as the company resorted to higher exports (HRC),"" said Edelweiss which sees 93 percent fall in profit, 22 percent decline in revenue and 56 percent degrowth in EBITDA.

EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.

Kotak expects India's steel realisations to decline sharply (down 6 percent QoQ, down 11 percent YoY) led by weak global prices and higher exports. It expects volumes to decline by 2 percent YoY (up 4 percent QoQ) at 3.1 million tonne due to weak domestic demand.

India EBITDA per tonne will decline by 25 percent QoQ to Rs 9,402 per tonne (down 50 percent YoY) with negative operating leverage and marginal decline in coal costs, said Kotak Institutional Equities, which also sees a similar kind of decline in earnings parameters in Q2 like Edelweiss.

According to Edelweiss, European operations are likely to slip in loss at EBITDA level as high cost iron ore inventory is likely to be consumed in this quarter.

Kotak estimates Europe EBITDA per tonne at $0 per tonne ($4 per tonne in Q1FY20) due to lower steel spreads.",298,-0.7646989673376083

The Nifty Metal index is about to cross its immediate highest level, which is placed at 2,576. Based on broader activity in the metal basket, we could see the index surpassing the previous high of 2,576.

The Metal index witnessed a vertical sell-off since January 2018. Since the last 22 months, there were signs of a reversal in the prevailing downtrend was missing.

The metal index is going to follow the path of the Auto index. The auto index has swallowed 50 percent gains from the top of 2018, similarly, the metal index was at 4,200 and from there it fell to 2,100 levels, which was 50 percent erosion of entire gains.

From the recent lowest level, the auto index is up by 27 percent and the metal index is up by 18 percent. Coincidently, both these indices have also taken some time to correct up to a certain extent.

Fundamentally, also economic cycles of both the indices are interrelated. It is a big positive for the stock market as both the cycles are confirming that they are bottoming up.

Stock specific: For the week we are covering three stocks from the metal index, which are exhibiting bullish strength.

Tata Steel: Buy | Target: Rs 460 | Stop Loss Rs 370

In the month January 2018, it was quoting at 756 and from there it fell to 320 in the month of October 2019, which is approximately 57 percent erosion in terms of the market capitalisation of the company.

On a weekly basis, it reached the oversold level and on a daily basis, the stock has validated the double bottom formation.

Based on the price action, the stock could rally towards Rs 450-460 levels in the near term. It has already closed above the break out level, which was between 380 and 375.

The strategy should be to buy at current levels, and more on declines towards Rs 385, and keep a stop loss placed below Rs 370 for the same.

Vedanta Ltd. Buy | Target: Rs 180 | Stop Loss: Rs 140

Vedanta has a tendency to give a shock to investors. In the year 2018-2019, it fell from Rs 355 to Rs 125 in 20 months.

After erasing nearly 65 percent of the entire gains, it is trying to stabilize. On a weekly basis, it is diverging positively, which is an indication of a shift in the prevailing trend.

We advise investors to buy the stock between Rs 155 and Rs 150 levels for the target Rs 180 and keep a final stop loss placed below at Rs 140.

Hindalco: Buy | Target: Rs 210 | Stop Loss: Rs 182

Hindalco has been one of the more stable stocks in the metal basket. It was trading at Rs 284 when it started correcting towards Rs 177, which is around 38 percent.

On a daily basis, it has formed a higher bottom at Rs 180 that would lift the stock towards Rs 210-215 in the near-term. Buying is advisable with a final stop loss at Rs 182, and on the higher side, it has the potential to move beyond Rs 210.

Less than 18 months after scooping up these distressed assets in the hopes of extracting value and boosting market share, the steelmakers are struggling to meet sales and production targets because of a slowdown in the key construction and auto sectors.

Tata Steel Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd and others are also wrestling with falling revenues amid high debt loads.

""The operating environment has changed from when they bid for these plants,"" said Amit Dixit, senior steel analyst with brokerage firm Edelweiss Financial Services. ""So their payback period obviously gets elongated now.""

Steel prices were high and demand was booming then. Now, confronted with falling prices and slower consumption, steelmakers are facing the risk of credit downgrades, job losses and cuts in capital expenditure.

Arnab Kumar Hazra, assistant secretary general at the Indian Steel Association, an industry group that also represents major steel producers, noted companies would take a longer time to turn their assets around in the current environment.

A deepening credit crunch in India's shadow banking industry following the collapse of a major infrastructure lender in 2018 has sharply dented spending on cars and real estate in India.

Domestic steel consumption in September was at its lowest since the start of the fiscal year 2019/20, according to official data.

India's car sales hit the brakes, hurting steel demand.

A synchronised global economic slowdown amid the U.S.-China trade war has compounded the problem, quashing global steel consumption and intensifying competition among exporters.

JSW Steel Ltd, which bought Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd in September last year, had promised to turn it around within a year but now says it will take another year.

The company will also miss its sales and production target for 2019/20 by 3% and has had to cut its capital expenditure by a third, said Seshagiri Rao, JSW's joint managing director and group chief financial officer.

""There is a credit squeeze, there is prolonged monsoon, a weaker government expenditure and fall in consumer demand,"" Rao said.

Tata Steel, which bought specialty steel firm Usha Martin Ltd in April, told Reuters the turnaround of the company would be delayed.

Tata Steel and JSW are not alone.

The world's biggest steelmaker ArcelorMittal and partner Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp, which committed $6 billion to acquire a 10 million tonne steel plant in India, will face similar issues, analysts have said.

PRESSURE BUILDING

The problems afflicting the steel majors, which together control over half the country's total steel production, have already surfaced among mid-sized firms.

""Inventory is high, debtor days have extended, and most mid-level steel companies are now contemplating job cuts,"" said R.K. Goyal, managing director of Kalyani Steels Ltd which relies heavily on the automotive sector for steel orders.

The credit crunch and slowdown in autos and real estate pushed India's GDP growth to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter, in a troubling sign for the steel sector whose fortunes are closely tied to the broader economy.

India's steel majors feel the sting of a steep slowdown in economic growth.

The extent of the slowdown is prompting companies to revise capital expenditure plans and others to question the ability of companies to achieve debt reduction goals.

Despite Tata Steel's move to partially defer expenditure on expansions, IIFL analyst Anupam Gupta said its plans to cut debt by $1 billion this fiscal year look ambitious, given weakening profitability across India and Europe.

Brokerage firm Edelweiss expects both JSW Steel and Tata Steel to see increases this year in their debt to EBIDTA ratios - a metric that reflects the cash available to companies to pay debts.

India's top steel firms facing rising debt to EBITDA ratios.

And the downward pressure on steelmakers does not look set to reverse soon.

Seven mining and metals companies, including Tata Steel from India, have partnered with the World Economic Forum (WEF) to accelerate responsible sourcing of raw materials with the World Economic Forum (WEF).

Geneva-based WEF, which describes itself as a public-private partnership for international cooperation, said the new 'Mining and Metals Blockchain Initiative' will explore the building of a blockchain platform to address transparency, the track and tracing of materials and the reporting of carbon emissions or increasing efficiency.

Besides Tata Steel, other founding members of the initiative are Antofagasta Minerals, Eurasian Resources Group Sarl, Glencore, Klockner & Co, Minsur SA and Anglo American/De Beers (Tracr).

The initiative will work towards experimenting, designing and deploying blockchain solutions that will accelerate responsible sourcing and sustainability practices.

These companies will pool resources and cost, increase speed-to-market and improve industry-wide trust that cannot be achieved by acting individually. It aims to be a neutral enabler for the industry, addressing the lack of standardization and improving efficiency.

The intention is to send out a signal of inclusivity and collaboration across the industry. The group will look to develop joint proof-of-concepts for an inclusive blockchain platform. Over time, this could help the industry collectively increase transparency, efficiency or improve reporting of carbon emissions.

The WEF has offered its platform and expertise to help industry leaders better understand the impact and potential of blockchain technology. It will provide guidance on governance issues related to the delivery of a neutral industry platform and the expansion of members.

Tata Steel's MD and CEO T V Narendran said, ""As a responsible player in the mining and metals industry, we are committed to building a sustainable future.

""We believe enhanced collaboration across the industry to facilitate collective action, leveraging technology to reduce emissions, and conserving the environment is imperative and critical in our journey towards attaining a carbon-neutral future.""

WEF's Blockchain Project Lead Nadia Hewett said, ""The distributed nature of blockchain technology makes it the ultimate networked technology. Forward-thinking organizations are starting to understand the disruptive potential of blockchain to solve pain points, but are now also recognizing that industry-wide collaboration around blockchain is necessary.""

Competitors within the same industry who research and experiment with blockchain or distributed ledger technology are increasingly exploring consortium formation to accelerate and strengthen blockchain technology knowledge and potential research and development.

This trend is reflected in the Deloitte Global Blockchain survey published in May, where the overwhelming majority (92 per cent) of respondents say they either belong to a consortium or plan to join one in the next 12 months.",434,0.933819568157196

The deepening slowdown in the automotive sector has resulted in Tata Steel's cold rolled steel unit here cutting production by 15 percent since the past six months.

The 3-lakh tonne plant t Tarapur in the Palghar district north of Mumbai, caters to nearly 30 percent of Tata Steel's supplies to the automotive sector.

The prolonged slowdown is also likely to impact sales from the plant this year as capacity utilization has come down to around 85 percent now, a senior company official has said, adding last fiscal, the plant had revenue of Rs 1,200 crore.

""The slowdown in the auto sector has impacted us since the past six months. Our capacity utilisation, which used to be 100 percent till last fiscal has come down to 85 percent,"" Tata Steel's head of cold rolling complex (west) Ujjwal Desai told a select group of visiting reporters.

He said the inventory at the factory has also piled up as dealers have not picked up the finished products.

""We had witnessed a similar slowdown in FY01. However, we are hopeful that there would be a revival soon,"" he said, adding since September there has been a slight improvement in the demand sentiment.

But revenue growth for the current fiscal may be impacted. Last year the company had reported revenue of Rs 1,200 crore, he added.

Tata Steel on Thursday said its crude steel production increased 4.65 per cent at 4.5 million tonne in second quarter ended September 30 as against 4.3 million tonne (MT) in the corresponding quarter last fiscal.

The crude steel production also includes numbers from Tata Steel BSL and Tata Steel Long Products, without eliminating inter-company transactions, the company said in a statement.

Its overseas arm Tata Steel Europe reported liquid steel production of 2.46 million tonne during quarter as against 2.42 million tonne in Q2 FY19.

""Tata Steel Europe's Q2FY20 production volume was lower primarily with adjustments related to weak market conditions, planned summer shutdowns and unplanned outages,"" the company said.

Tata Steel South East Asia reported a saleable steel production stood at 5.7 lakh tonne as compared to 5.4 lakh tonne in Q2 FY19.

The sales, however, declined across the three markets with Tata Steel reporting a sales of 4.14 million tonne in Q2 FY20 from 4.32 million tonne.

Tata Steel Europe and Tata Steel South East Asia reported sales of 2.28 million and 6.1 lakh tonne as against 2.27 million and 6.5 lakh tonne in Q2 FY20.

""During the quarter, lower volumes to automotive segment were compensated by higher exports while deliveries in branded products and retail segment and industrial product and projects segment were maintained,"" it said.

The company further said that the recent rate cuts by the RBI are a welcome step to improve liquidity though transmission of the rate cuts is not evident and hence the credit off-take has not yet picked up.

Domestic giant Tata Steel on Thursday said overall steel demand in the second quarter of 2019-20 was impacted due to factors such as rains and subdued economic activities that also plummeted vehicle sales. Tata Steel India recorded an output of 4.50 million tonne (MT) in the second quarter as against 4.30 MT in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Its sales volumes during the quarter, however, took a hit recording 4.14 MT sales as compared to 4.32 in the year-ago quarter.

""During the quarter, overall economy activities in India further weakened as reflected in low investment sentiment and demand slowdown as is evident in plummeting vehicle sales and weak GST collections. This combined with a seasonally weaker monsoon quarter adversely affected overall demand for steel,"" Tata Steel said in a statement here.

The Indian government has announced various measures to stimulate economic activities and market sentiments, it said and added that, however, the benefits of the same in terms of new private investments and improved domestic consumption will potentially manifest only in the longer term.

It said the recent rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India are a welcome step to improve liquidity though transmission of the rate cuts is not evident and, hence, the credit offtake has not yet picked up.

""However, as the monsoon season comes to an end and the festive season starts, an improvement in sentiment is expected to trigger a pick-up in consumption and, thus, steel demand,"" it said.

Tata Steel India's second quarter sales volume increased by 5 per cent quarter-on-quarter primarily with better volumes at Tata Steel BSL.

During the quarter, lower volumes at the automotive segment were compensated by higher exports, while deliveries in branded products and retail segments and industrial product and projects segments were maintained.

About the global business, it said the ""confidence remained subdued during 2QFY20 as weakening economic activities and prolonged uncertainty over trade conflicts impacted investment decisions and trade flows. The accommodative monetary policy stance by key advanced and emerging market economies is yet to show any noteworthy impact on economic activity levels.""

Consequently, apparent steel demand remained weak, weighing on steel prices across geographies, it said and added though the regional spot steel spreads have begun improving since mid-July 2019 from the lows of first quarter 2019-20 with softening coking coal and iron ore prices, the meaningful benefit will flow through in the next few quarters.

""In Europe, the steel industry continued to face significant headwinds amidst lower demand conditions due to Brexit uncertainty and trade conflicts,"" it said.

Tata Steel Europe's production volume was lower at 2.46 MT in the second quarter of the current financial year primarily with adjustments related to weaker market conditions, planned summer shutdowns and unplanned outages, it said.

The sales volumes during the quarter was almost flat at 2.28 MT.

Tata Steel Group is among the top global steel companies with an annual crude steel capacity of 33 million tonnes per annum (MTPA).

The government delivered just what the doctor ordered paving the way for higher growth in the economy and simultaneously giving investors the confidence that the bull cycle is still intact.

In a historic move, the FM announced bold corporate tax reforms. The reduction in the base rate of corporate tax to 22 percent (effective maximum tax rate 25.17 percent) for Financial Year 2019-20 subject to the condition that such companies will not avail any exemption/incentive is one of the boldest tax reforms.

The current base tax rate (excluding surcharge and cess) is 30 percent (effective maximum tax rate 34.944 percent) for companies having a turnover exceeding Rs 400 crores and 25 percent (effective maximum tax rate 29.12 percent) for companies having a turnover up to Rs 400 crores.

What does the tax rate cut mean for Nifty companies?

""There are only 20 Nifty companies which paid more than 30 percent effective tax rate and accounted for 43 percent of the overall net profit in FY19,” Kotak Securities said in a report.

Companies which are paying more than 30 percent tax include names like ZEE Entertainment, HDFC Bank, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindalco Industries, Axis Bank, ITC, GAIL India, and JSW Steel.

Fall in taxes will lead to a rise in EPS by double digits which is a positive sign especially at a time when earnings have been muted or largely in single digits for the last 12-18 months.

Nilesh Shah, MD & CEO, Envision Capital in an interview with CNBC-TV18 said that investors should look at buying companies with high tax rates. The other sectors which are likely to benefit are the ones in sectors like consumer, financials and technology services.

“Any company paying 33 percent tax rate will see its earnings go up by 12 percent. Overall, we can see Nifty earnings going up by ~5-6 percent in FY20 as the effective tax rate was already lower at 26 percent,” said Oza.

He further added that the sentiment booster angle and the way this will be taken positively by FIIs and local investors we can expect the Nifty to rally by 9-10 percent from today’s low of ~10,700. Hence, 11,500-11,600 is very much possible on the Nifty without considering any other factor.

The government has taken a hit on revenues of approximately Rs 1.45 lakh crore per annum by reducing corporate tax for existing companies to 22 percent (25.17 percent effective tax) from 30 percent.

There is a big boost for companies going for fresh capex and make in India as tax rates will be just 15 percent for companies making fresh investment and incorporated after 1st Oct 2019,” Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities told Moneycontrol.

Despite being a fair distance away from record-high levels, Nifty's slow but steady rise toward 12,000 is good news for the Indian markets especially as more than 50 percent of the stocks in the index are available at attractive valuations.

About 23 companies, or nearly 50%, of the Nifty50 universe is trading at a discount to their 10-year P/E multiple, data from Motilal Oswal and AceEquity showed. These include Tata Steel, ONGC, Coal India, NTPC, JSW Steel, IOC, Gail India, Axis Bank, Power Grid, among others.

Even though the valuations appear mouthwatering, the questions remains– should you buy around these levels or one should stay put or avoid getting into these stocks altogether?

Investors must note that even though these stock appear attractive based on numbers, the fundamentals may present a different story. Most experts we spoke to opined that investors should tread cautiously when it comes to these stocks.

A Price-to-Earnings ratio or PE value the company is a ratio of current market price to its earnings per share. It also referred to as multiple. This measure of valuing the company is used by investors to filter out stocks for investment.

The golden rule of investment is to pour money in stocks that are trading at attractive levels compared to their intrinsic value, thus allowing investors to create wealth over a period of time.

“We would advise not to go by only the price decline from average price as average can shift further below. Key is to look at what are the business ecosystem that can drift the positives turn profitable for the company and how it reflects on share price,” Pritam Deuskar, Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“Today, it looks like as if the pharma sector has bottomed out but when it will start working nobody knows. The kind of infra spending, smart cities, airports, and construction budget till 2030 will come out, for sure some of these companies will benefit,” he said.

Well, markets are built on hope and everything gets priced well in advance. Fundamentally speaking, individual stock fundamentals and business developments matter more than just the price of the stock. Should investors bottom fish in some of these names?

“One has to carry out stock-specific analysis while bottom fishing stocks which are trading at a discount to their historical averages,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“Many of these stocks are cyclical, like Tata Steel, JSW Steel, ONGC and Coal India. These stocks are driven by their commodity-related specifics. Sustainable growth plays an important role while ascertaining a stock’s fundamentals. Sun Pharma and Zee have been in the news for corporate governance reasons, one of them might be out of the woods,” he said.

How relevant are long term averages?

Long term moving averages define the price action of a security. It is a good tool to use while analyzing market movements as valuations are key while analyzing indexes, suggest experts.

The golden rule is that if the index is trading at a significant premium above the moving average then it might be a good time to sell, and vice-versa. But, it should be used with other parameters such as price to book value, as well as moving averages.

“Buying stocks that are trading at deep discounts to long term moving average works better when this happens in cyclical industries. Moving averages like 200 DMA & 30 DMA acts as a general indicator of long term and short term trends,” Romesh Tiwari, Head of Research, CapitalAim told Moneycontrol.

“It must be used with other parameters like PE ratio and Price to book value to make long term buying and selling decisions in quality stocks,” he said.

In the previous week, two sectors— CPSE (central public sector enterprises) index and Nifty Metal Index—outperformed other indices.

The CPSE index added 4.97 percent to the previous week and metal index gained 2.96 percent and closed at 2,358.

For the week, we are choosing a metal index for analysis.

We are considering data for the 2015-19 period because around this time markets faced a number of major events like national and state elections, US polls, Brexit currency fluctuation, exceptional fall and rise in crude prices, the demonetisation of high value Indian currency notes and the ongoing tariff war.

These events were unpredictable and impacted commodity sector heavily. The CPSE index is mainly depends on the news flow from the government, which is highly uncertain and difficult to analyse.

The metal index made a low of 1,450 in the year 2016, when crude prices were at $33 per barrel. From there, it doubled in just 24 months in the year 2018.

During the same period, the number of metal stocks doubled, but few such as Vedanta and JSPL gave five-fold returns.

JSW Steel quadrupled, Hindalco, NALCO and Tata steel tripled. The metal sector is the most sensitive sector to global and domestic developments.

It is also sensitive to market’s liquidity conditions.

In the previous week, China cut credit reserve ratio (CRR) by 50 basis points to infuse liquidity in the market. It has a direct correlation with the metal index that could improve in the coming months.

It essentially means that at the global level, major economies have started taking steps to fight the recessionary phase and we could see more developments and measures from them.

Our government is also addressing the issues that auto and other major industries are facing, which is a positive for the economy as well as the metal sector.

Indirectly, it will support the metal sector, which provides raw material to the industries. That is the reason metals will perform if the government takes steps to support the economy.

Technically, the metal index doubled in two years, gained 2,800 points but in last 21 months, it has lost about 2,100 points, which is nearly 75 percent erosion.

It implies that the sector is about to turn oversold and we could see starting of value buying or contra buying at the current or little lower levels.

When we scanned 13 stocks metals and mining stocks, we found that Hindalco and JSW Steel were outperforming, as they had eroded nearly 50-65 percent of their entire gains.

Underperforming stocks are prominently from mining and PSU space, namely Coal India, NMDC and SAIL. They have lost their entire gains of 2016, and 2018, which is a cause of concern.

Stocks that are parallel to neutral or parallel to the metal index are Vedanta, Tata Steel, Welspun Corp, JSPL, NALCO, and MOIL.

Based on the above observations, findings, and technical patterns, we should focus on JSW Steel and Hindalco from the outperforming space. We need to focus on Tata Steel as it’s a liquid stock and helps to have a positive beta.

JSW Steel: Stock could move towards Rs 250

Technically, JSW Steel is diverging positively and till the stock is above 200, it could move to 250 above which the stock has spent maximum time. It was earlier major support for JSW Steel. A close below 200, it would fall to 180.

Hindalco: Has scope to move towards Rs 205-210

Hindalco has completed corrective pattern at 170 and for the last five weeks, its has sustained well above it, whereas during the same period, the metal index lost nearly 10 percent.

Till the stock is above 170, it has scope to move up to 205/210, which was the earlier highest level for it. Below 170, again it would turn negative and move towards 150.

Tata Steel: Stock likely to head towards Rs 370

Tata Steel has corrected to extreme levels and has formed multiple bottoms at 328 and is showing signs of a strong pullback in the short term. We can expect minimum 370 on the higher side. Below 328, Tata Steel could fall to 300.

The complaint to the General Court of the European Union - seen as a symbolic move - comes after the Commission in June vetoed plans to create Europe’s second-biggest steelmaker, fearing it would overly hurt competition.

The Commission was most concerned about the two companies’ combined position in the area of automotive and packaging steel, resulting in a remedy proposal Thyssenkrupp said would have been sufficient. Brussels disagreed.

“In its competitive assessment of the product groups of packaging steel and hot-dip galvanized steel for the automotive industry, the Commission has for the first time set out a restrictive market definition that unduly extends the scope of the existing competition law,” Thyssenkrupp said in a statement.

It was already clear in early May that Brussels would block the deal, causing a strategic U-turn at the group which includes a planned stock market listing or sale of its elevators division.

Thyssenkrupp’s steel division - Steel Europe - is now expected to remain part of the group in the long-term, Thyssenkrupp has said, though it has not ruled out partnerships or the sale of a minority stake.",212,-0.990376889705658

The Indian steelmaker, which runs the UK's largest steelworks at Port Talbot in south Wales, lost 371 million pounds in Britain in the financial year until March end this year as a result of lower production.

The losses mark a hike from 222 million pounds a year earlier, according to 'The Sunday Times'.

As per the annual report, the company's turnover from its UK plant rose 1 percent to 2.4 million pounds, but the production fell from 3.6 million tons to 3.2 million after one of the two blast furnaces was shut down for maintenance.

Tata Steel spent 56 million pounds during the year to extend the furnace's life by up to seven years.

""The losses for Tata Steel UK, disclosed in its annual report, come as the industry struggles to forge a future,"" the newspaper report said.

""Tata has spent the past few years unwinding its top-of-the-market 6.2 billion pounds takeover of Anglo-Dutch steel giant Corus in 2007,"" it adds.

The Tata Group employs 8,500 staff in its UK steel business. The company's hopes for a turnaround in fortunes for its European arm with a merger with Germany's Thyssenkrupp collapsed in May this year, after it was blocked by the European Commission on competition grounds.

While admitting that the proposed JV was an important strategic initiative for the company to create a sustainable portfolio in Europe, Tata Steel had stressed that it would explore all options to achieve similar outcomes in the future.

""Our strategy is to be the leading and most sustainable flat steel company in Europe with a strong focus on delivering value, especially for our customers, our employees and our shareholders.

""This strategy will continue to guide us and I'm confident we will chart a strong path forward for all our stakeholders,"" Hans Fischer, CEO of Tata Steel's European operations, had said at the time.

Tata Steel is one of Europe's leading steel producers, with steelmaking in the Netherlands and the UK, and manufacturing plants across Europe.

The company says it supplies high-quality steel products to the most demanding markets, including construction and infrastructure, automotive, packaging and engineering.

A few years ago in 2016 amid ongoing strains on the worldwide steel industry, Tata Steel had sold British Steel to Greybull Capital, but the private equity firm's attempt to revive the business failed as it collapsed in May this year. It is now in the process of being sold by administrators.",428,-0.3719190027978685

The steel sector is expected to see a pick up in the second half of the year, a top company official said.

""We have given a guidance that the capex will be 20-25 per cent lower than the original plan between Europe and India (operations)... our original estimate was Rs 12,000 crore for the Tata Steel Group... it will now be around Rs 8,000 crore,"" Tata Steel CEO and MD T V Narendran said.

Of the Rs 12,000 crore, the steel major had initially planned to spend around Rs 8,000 crore on India operations.

""Both sides (India and Europe) will take a cut,"" Narendran told reporters here after the launch of the company's steel retail store -- 'steeljunction'.

He said the capex for India will largely be deployed on its Kalinganagar plant in Odisha.

""We do believe that things should improve in the second half of the year,"" Narendran said.

The top Tata Steel official said in order to insulate the steel industry from its cyclical nature, the company is focusing on strengthening the branded consumer business and downstream product portfolio.

""Today the B2C business is about 15 per cent of our revenue. We have set a target that the B2C, services and solutions business should contribute 30 per cent (in the next five years),"" he said.

On the South-East Asia business, he said the company has signed an MoU with the Synergy Group, which is ""interested in our Thailand assets"".

""We should come to a conclusion in the next two-three months,"" Narendran said.

Following the termination of the definitive agreement with the HBIS Group to divest 70 per cent stake in its South- East Asia business, Tata Steel had executed a Memorandum of Understanding to offload the stake in Tata Steel Thailand to Synergy Metals and Mining Fund.

""We have a lot of subsidiaries in Europe and many of them were created over a period of time. At one point of time, we had 200-300 legal entities and subsidiaries of Tata Steel Europe.

""We have reduced them significantly and are paring another 100-120 this year... In India, it is all about bringing operating subsidiaries together,"" Narendran said.",393,0.9999931653340658

Even as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cuts world economic growth projections for the current year, the US-China trade war has intensified weakening prospects for global steel demand. Steel prices have corrected sharply on account of the fall in steel demand globally.

However, Tata Steel faced little impact of the happenings in the steel sector. Despite these issues hurting sentiment, Tata Steel, during the June quarter, recorded 11 percent year-on-year growth in group revenue. This was largely on account of strong performance from its India operation, which accounts for close to 60 percent of total revenue.

Its India operation reported 19 percent growth in sales volumes largely due to strong demand in the long products category. This provided some cushion from falling volumes in Europe.

Europe, which contributes about 40 percent to consolidated sales, saw a 7.8 percent drop in sales volumes because of low demand and planned production shutdown. Consolidated volume growth was 5.3 percent.

Nevertheless, lower steel prices had an impact and benefits of higher volumes were reduced to that extent. For instance, Chinese HRC export prices, which stood around $625 a tonne last year, have dropped to around $500 in Q1 FY20.

Due to lower realisation, consolidated revenue grew a modest 1.3 percent to Rs 35,947 crore during the quarter under review.

Operating performanceWhile the performance at the revenue level was still reasonable, the impact of higher cost, due to higher iron ore and coking coal prices, impacted the company’s operating performance.

In the standalone business, which has integrated operations, raw material cost as a percent of sales moved up marginally (260 basis points) on a year- on-year basis. At the consolidated level, the impact was 586 bps, largely because of Europe and other entities (recently acquired assets).

For instance, Tata Steel BSL’s (Bhushan) raw material cost, as a percent of sales, jumped to 67 percent in Q1 FY20 from 53 percent in Q1 FY19. This despite an over 100 percent jump in sales turnover to Rs 4,333 crore in Q1 FY20.

Operational parameters

The same was is reflected in the EBITDA-level performance. At the consolidated level, EBITDA dropped 26 percent to Rs 8,725 per tonne. European business saw a steep decline to Rs 277 a tonne in Q1 FY20 from Rs 6,794 per tonne in the same period last year.

Lower realisations, due to falling steel prices and higher cost, led to this poor performance at the operating level. This also impacted net profits. Largely because of a steep drop in European profitability, consolidated net profit dropped 64 percent YoY to Rs 702 crore in Q1.

Valuation and outlookSteel prices are expected to remain subdued in the near term and pressure is increasing on account of higher raw material. These issues and lower demand, particularly during monsoons, would reflect in Q2 FY20.

Moreover, with fresh hiccups in divesting its South Asian business and European operations as well as high debt on its books as a result of the acquisition of Bhushan Steel and Usha Martin, we remain cautious on the counter in the near term.

In an uncertain environment, managing debt and monetising assets could face difficulty, particularly if there is a longer-than-expected slowdown in demand and decline in steel prices.

At the current market price of Rs 382 per share, the stock is trading at 5.4 times its FY20 consensus estimated enterprise value (EV)-to-EBITDA and 5.3 times its estimated FY21 EV/ EBITDA.

Tata Steel slipped over 2 percent intraday on August 8, a day after it reported a steep 64.3 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in June quarter profit at Rs 693 crore amid muted revenue growth and subdued operating income.

The profit in the corresponding quarter last year was Rs 1,940.8 crore. Lower other income (down 29 percent YoY) also impacted the bottom line.

Revenue during the quarter grew 1.27 percent YoY to Rs 35,947.1 crore, dented by lower domestic and Europe growth.

It was supported by Tata Steel BSL (erstwhile Bhushan Steel acquired under NCLT) which grew 105.5 percent YoY to Rs 4,332.73 crore in Q1FY20.

Reacting to the news, CLSA maintained its sell rating on Tata Steel but slashed its target price to Rs 320 from Rs 395 earlier.

Fall in margin took a toll on the financial performance of Tata Steel. The standalone margin held up on a QoQ basis but should fall in the September quarter, said the note.

Global steel prices are under pressure, and hopes for any big rally are fading at this point in time. CLSA slashed FY20 earnings by 22 percent. The FY20-21 EPS is still 31-40 percent below street estimates.

Steel prices in India declined as subdued economic activity, seasonal slowdown and liquidity issues weighed on domestic consumption. Higher net imports further exacerbated the demand-supply balance, the company said.

At the operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation dropped 15.4 percent YoY to Rs 5,376.9 crore and margin contracted 294bps to 14.96 percent in the quarter ended June 2019, partly dented by higher finance and depreciation costs in Q1.",280,-0.5555271373854743

Steel prices in India declined as subdued economic activity, seasonal slowdown and liquidity issues weighed on domestic consumption. Higher net imports further exacerbated the demand-supply balance, the company said.

""In Europe, the steel industry faces significant headwinds in terms of lower economic growth, uncertainty around Brexit and the trade conflict. This coupled with a rising share of imports and elevated raw material prices led to a sharp decline in steel spreads,"" it added.

However, the company has delivered 11 percent YoY volume growth for production and 5 percent YoY for deliveries.

Numbers were lower than analyst expectations. Profit was estimated at Rs 1,350 crore on the revenue at Rs 37,050 crore and EBITDA was estimated at Rs 5,615 crore with margin at 15.2 percent for the quarter, according to a poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18.

Taking note of its Kalinganagar unit, Chandrasekaran said that its capacity will expand to 8 million tons per annum (mtpa), from the present 3 mtpa by 2022. However, he underlined that the deadline is subjective to market conditions and the company’s cash flow position.

The last financial year witnessed a setback after the collapse of the proposed JV between the European businesses of Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp. The JV was blocked by the European Commission, which said that the new entity will hurt competition.

Chandrasekaran continued that that the company was now focusing on “turning around” the European units based in the UK and the Netherlands. “The focus is to turn around these companies and become cash flow positive and work towards self-sustaining capital expenditure and operations,” he noted.

Similar sentiments were shared by Global MD & CEO TV Narendran, who in an interview to Moneycontrol had recently said that the European management has been given two years to focus on becoming cash flow positive.

The AGM approved Narendran’s second term. He was first appointed to head the Indian and South East Asian businesses in 2013. His second term will last until 2023.",289,0.5074517846107482

Global brokerage house Citi maintained sell rating on JSW Steel, SAIL and Tata Steel on China worries. These stocks fell more than 1 percent intraday on July 17.

Recently the government recommended anti-dumping duty on imports of flat-rolled product of steel, and plated/ coated with alloy of aluminium and zinc.

The anti-dumping duty recommended was for imports from China, Vietnam and Korea, but the consumption of product mentioned is 0.5 million, which is less than 1 percent of India's steel consumption, Citi said.

Hence, Steel Authority of India stock was down 0.85 percent at Rs 46.85, Tata Steel down 1.15 percent at Rs 471 and JSW Steel down 1.44 percent at Rs 269.90 on the BSE at 1308 hours IST.

It was not a start that a Managing Director would wish for. But TV Narendran had no choice. The first crisis hit within two weeks of him taking over at the helm of Tata Steel's India and South East Asia businesses, in November 2013.

There was a huge explosion in Jamshedpur, the company's iconic steelmaking facility. It was a heavy dent on a company that prided on its safety record and employee welfare. As Narendran said, ""It was a huge issue, and had never happened.""

The crisis was just one of the many that were to come. A little over a year later, the government passed the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, which temporarily closed down mines of Tata Steel. The company was forced to import iron ore, again a first for the steelmaker.

Just when things were getting back to normal, and Tata Steel got to reopen the mines, China - the world's largest steelmaker and consumer - went into a tailspin in 2015. ""Within six months, steel prices went to the levels of 2003,"" recalls the Tata Steel chief.

If the start was not great, the end of his first five-year tenure was marked by another serious setback. The proposed joint venture with thyssenkrupp, which would have merged the European businesses of the two companies, couldn't clear the regulatory hurdle. It was called off earlier this year.

""Sometimes things work your way, sometimes they don’t. One has to keep chin up and move on,"" Narendran told Moneycontrol in a recent interview in Mumbai. ""We never like to waste a crisis. We want to become stronger coming out of a crisis,"" he added.

Chin up, he did. Over these five years, and despite the many setbacks, Tata Steel has become a leaner company by expanding its India business, and shedding much of the weight of its European operations.

From 18 million tons, the European unit now makes 10 million tons of steel. The UK facility, a bigger part of the challenge, now manufactures 3 million tons a year, down from the earlier 11 million tons. The rest comes from the more profitable, Netherlands-based unit.

""Today we are seen as a very serious player in Europe's auto industry which was not our reputation a few years back. In fact, the JV with thyssenkrupp may have been cleared if we hadn't been such a strong player,"" said Narendran. One of the objections raised by the European Commission, which was investigating the JV, was over the monopolistic position of the venture in Europe's auto sector.

In India, the annual capacity has grown to 18 million tons over the five years, especially thanks to the acquisition of Usha Martin and Bhushan Steel. Equally important was the commissioning of the Kalinganagar facility - which was in the works for over a decade - in 2016.

The achievements were noticed, and Narendran - who Tata Group insiders said has the backing of Chairman N Chandrasekaran - was elevated as Global CEO & Managing Director of Tata Steel in 2017.

His second tenure comes up for shareholders' approval in the upcoming AGM on July 19.

The unlikely candidate

Narendran's appointment as the Tata Steel MD was a surprise for many in the industry.

Not because he lacked the qualifications. After completing his engineering from National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli and MBA from IIM Calcutta, Narendran joined Tata Steel in 1988, as a trainee.

But while his predecessors were ""operations guys"", Narendran was seen as a marketing veteran, who had spent considerable years outside India. Just before taking the top job, he was heading the South East Asia business.

The choice though has helped refocus the company to produce more of what can be sold profitably. In some of the segments, it now operates like a consumer durables company, bringing in higher margins.

Personally too, Narendran has eased into the role. Even as he shuttles between Jamshedpur, Mumbai and Europe, the 54-year-old manages to keep aside time for himself. A 5am-riser, Narendran goes for 10k runs - 'am not Chandra (the Chairman, who is a known marathoner),' he clarified with a chuckle.

In Jamshedpur, the wicketkeeper-turned all rounder-turned batsman ('my arms don't let me bowl anymore') manages to squeeze in an innings or two.

What he misses most is his Labrador Zoey, whom he prefers to keep in Jamshedpur. ""A flat in Mumbai would be too constraining for her.""

Irrespective of the location though, Narendran has managed to continue some of his most passionate initiatives, including the informal meetings with company's young executives.

It was a practice he started in Singapore, where he was heading the South East Asia business. ""As you become more senior you get disconnected from people on the ground. And these are not people you would see regularly in meetings,"" said Narendran.

It helped in several ways. One he was able to engage young professionals below 30 years, who have been most prone to leave the company. ""Our attrition rates are highest with people who have spent less than five years in the company,"" said the global MD & CEO.

Second, these conversations sparked new ideas. While the company's LGBT policy was developed and framed after one such meeting, another gathering highlighted the need for a further and wider cultural change.

""Once, I had a group breakfast meeting with the youngsters and one of them asked me, ""Pioneering is one of our values but all the pioneering stuff you are talking about was done 100 years ago. What is the pioneering stuff that you are doing now?' It was a very valid question,"" recounted Narendran.

The next five

And that is what Narendran wants to do in the next five years of his tenure as Tata Steel's Global MD & CEO.

""To me the last five years have been about dealing with the challenges and also dealing with the structural strength of Tata Steel. That ball is rolling and will continue to roll. The next five years is more about cultural issues and new businesses,"" he said.

Among the new business, Tata Steel has ventured into scrap recycling, a first for a major steelmaker in India. ""These are to me seeds that we are planting for the future,"" says Narendran, about the project that he accepts is close to his heart. The new vertical, called new materials business, will also manufacture fibre reinforced polymer that are used in auto and infrastructure sectors.

Another big initiative is to make Tata Steel among the top 5 in the world in R&D. ""We have a team working on that,"" he said of the transformation project that will take at least five years. ""If you see South Korean steelmaker POSCO, they were nobody in technology, but today they are one of the leaders.""

Overall, he wants Tata Steel to be agile, a difficult task otherwise for an organisation that is as colossal as the steel company.

""Tata Steel is a battleship, you can’t drive it like a power boat. But at the same time the world is becoming more volatile, so you need to be agile... So, to me these are the changes that we want to drive in Tata Steel over the next few years.""

That will very well underline his legacy.",1218,-0.06926913931965828

At an event hosted by Dutch firm Hardt Hyperloop in the Netherlands on Thursday, the Indian steel major showcased how it has helped to develop the tube technology required to allow passengers in the hyperloop to be carried at speeds of up to 1,200 km/hr, while reducing weight and construction costs by more than 50 per cent.

""We are committed to having a positive impact in the world we live in. We believe that hyperloop technology can help to achieve this by contributing to new, fast and sustainable mobility,"" said Hans van den Berg, Director of Tata Steel's IJmuiden steelmaking site in the Netherlands.

Steel is a vital component for hyperloop. We are pleased to be able to share our high-tech innovation skills and materials expertise to contribute to its future success,"" he said.

Among some of Tata Steel's other focus in the transport sector, it also unveiled lane-switching technology, which allows hyperloop vehicles to change from one lane to another at high speed. Tata Steel supplied the tracks and the motor components, which are both made of steel, the company said.

The development of the hyperloop lane switch marks the end of the first test phase at the low-speed test facility at Delft in the Netherlands, which assessed fundamental hyperloop technologies including magnetic levitation, a low-pressure environment, a propulsion system, and cargo/passenger weight simulations.

The steel components, which have now been successfully tested and proven to be functional, serve as the basis for future projects planned by Hardt Hyperloop, Tata Steel and other partners, Tata said.

Hardt Hyperloop also revealed the next stage in development, which includes a 3 km track which will allow for the high-speed testing of vehicles and will provide the basis for the standardisation in European hyperloop infrastructure and technology.

Tata Steel June 27 said its European business chief executive Hans Fischer will step down, effective July 1. However, Fischer will continue to serve on the board of Tata Steel Europe (TSE) as non-executive director and advise T V Narendran, CEO and MD of Tata Steel Limited till September 30, according to a regulatory filing.

Henrik Adam, currently Chief Commercial Officer Tata Steel Europe, has been appointed to succeed Hans as the CEO from July 1, 2019. He will also join the board of TSE and report to Narendran.

The development comes nearly a fortnight after the European Commission on June 11, 2019 blocked Tata Steel's proposed merger of its European business with German giant ThyssenKrupp over monopoly situation.

""Hans Fischer, Chief Executive Officer of TSE, has decided to retire from the position of CEO with effect from July 1, 2019. He will continue to serve on the Board of TSE as a Non-Executive Director and Adviser to T V Narendran, CEO and MD of Tata Steel Limited till September 30, 2019 to ensure smooth transition of leadership,"" Tata Steel said.

A mechanical engineering graduate from Eindhoven University, Hans embarked on his professional career as a project manager in the engineering department of the former Tata Steel Netherlands in 1985.

In March 2016, Hans became CEO of Tata Steel Europe as well as a board member.

N K Misra, Executive Director (Finance) of TSE, will retire from his position on December 31, 2019 and Sandip Biswas, Group Executive Vice President (Finance) of Tata Steel Limited, has been appointed as the Executive Director of TSE with effect from July 1, 2019, responsible to drive the company's transformation programme.

However, Biswas, Tata Steel said, will work closely with Misra for a smooth transition and take over as the CFO of TSE.

In Europe, India-headquartered Tata Steel could not pursue its plan of merging its business with ThyssenKrupp as the European Commission said that the merger would have led to a spike in the metal's prices.

ThyssenKrupp had also on its own had withdrew from the joint venture plans in anticipation of the EU ruling.

The Commission concluded that under the EU Merger Regulation, a merger between Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp - to create the second-largest European steel entity behind Lakshmi N Mittal's ArcelorMittal - would have reduced competition and increased prices.

The EU's powerful anti-trust authority had blocked the merger saying, ""We prohibited the merger to avoid serious harm to European industrial customers and consumers.",423,-0.35733290513356525

Tata Steel is setting up India's first scrap recycling plant, which will be based in Rohtak, Haryana. The move will give the company an early lead among peers as scrap generation increases in the Indian economy, which is also the fastest growing steel market in the world.

Being set up on BOO (built, own and operate) model, the unit will have a capacity of five lakh tonne a year. To implement and run the plant, Tata Steel has entered into a long-term BOO agreement with Aarti Green Tech, a unit of the Ludiana-based Aarti Steels.

""In preparing for the future, Tata Steel has set up a steel recycling business to meet the growing demand for steel in a sustainable manner in the long run,"" said TV Narendran, CEO & MD, Tata Steel.

""The steel recycling business will help formalise the scrap market in India and help the country transition to a scrap-based steel making route in the long-term,"" he added.

The company is investing Rs 150 crore in the venture and expects to commercially start producing in the second half of the present fiscal.

There are further plans to set up similar units across the country.

Nascent stageDespite the domestic market's growing stature in the world steel market, it still lags -- like it does in the per capita consumption parameter -- in generation of steel scrap and its usage.

At present, the annual demand for steel scrap in India is 30 million tonne, with five million tonne imported every year. Automobile, construction and ship-breaking industries are the largest generators of steel scrap.

On the other hand, the world's largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal alone recycles 30 million tonne of steel a year. It is sure to bring this capability to India, if it succeeds in its pursuit for Essar Steel, which is facing insolvency proceeding.

That is why the initiative of Tata Steel, now the second largest steelmaker in India after JSW Steel, will help.

The Indian scrap industry is highly fragmented and unorganised, and availability of clean scrap is low. Most operations are manual and lack of safety and environment standards, make the operations risky to life and health.

Tata Steel plans to use digital platforms and channel networks to collect scrap from various segments such as households, and end of life vehicles. This scrap will be processed through mechanised equipment and used as an input raw material for downstream steel making through the Electric Arc Furnace route.

This route of steel making uses scrap as a key input and reduces carbon emissions by up to 60 percent. That is an important detail for an industry that has been under the spot for being one of the largest emitter of carbon in the world.

""Steel is 100 percent recyclable material and can be used repeatedly to create new steel products, without losing the inherent properties of steel. This helps reduce the use of natural resources as well as leads to low CO2 emissions,"" said Narendran.",505,0.5602867305278778

SAIL is already in talks with a few global companies which are into auto-grade steel making, Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) Chairman Anil Kumar Chaudhary said.

The country's largest steel maker and Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal had entered into an MoU in May 2015 to explore the possibility of setting up an auto-grade steel manufacturing facility under a joint venture in India.

About two and a half years later in December 2017, the SAIL board approved the proposal to enter into a joint venture with the world's largest steel maker ArcelorMittal for manufacturing high-end automotive steel.

However, definitive agreements in this regard were to be finalised in due course, subject to financial viability.

""Of course, the talks with ArcelorMittal have got delayed but that is not the end, there are many other companies in the world in the auto-grade steel making. So, we are already in touch with some of the Korean companies POSCO and Hyundai Steel,"" the chairman told PTI while replying to question related to delay in decision.

There are some Japanese firms as well - like Nippon Steel, Kobe Steel and JFE - with whom SAIL is in talks with, he said, adding that the JV with ArcelorMittal is still on.

""It (JV) is not closed. It is still on. May be they are too busy with Essar Steel Acquisition, they want to wait for some more time. When we talk to them verbally, they say we are open to discuss many more things but let first the fate of Essar Steel get decided,"" Chaudhary said.

Essar Steel is undergoing insolvency proceedings.

The chairman further made it clear that there is no delay from SAIL's side.

Even ArcelorMittal has not responded to a letter written by SAIL in February asking the former to expedite the process for signing a definitive agreement to set up a joint venture for high-end automotive steel plant, he said.

PTI had earlier reported that steel companies from South Korea and Japan have shown interest to invest in India for manufacturing value-added products.

The companies had also visited SAIL and RINL plants.

The steel ministry has also held several rounds of discussions to facilitate manufacturing of high-grade steel in India with the help of foreign companies especially from South Korea and Japan.

Tata Steel on June 1 announced that it has completed the acquisition of debt-ridden Bhushan Energy Ltd.

The announcement came after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the resolution plan of Tata Steel to acquire Bhushan Energy for around Rs 800 crore.

""We wish to inform you that Tata Steel BSL Ltd has successfully completed the acquisition of Bhushan Energy Limited (BEL) in accordance with the Approved Resolution Plan under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016,"" Tata Steel said in a BSE filing.

Pursuant to the acquisition, the company holds 99.99 per cent of the total equity share capital of BEL.

""This disclosure is made in compliance with Regulation 30 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015,"" the filing said.

The principal bench of NCLT Delhi on Thursday also rejected objections from Bhushan Energy's former promoter Neeraj Singal opposing Tata Steels' bid.

Bhushan Energy was a subsidiary of Bhushan Steel Ltd, which was also taken over by Tata Steel last year in May and later renamed as Tata Steel BSL Ltd.

Tata Steel had offered Rs 35,200 crore in cash to acquire Bhushan Steel besides Rs 1,200 crore to creditors and convert the remaining debt owed to banks to equity.

Incorporated in 2005, Bhushan Energy is based in Dhenkanal, Odisha.

In FY 2015-16, Bhushan Energy had reported a gross debt of Rs 2,336 crore.

Earlier in June last year, in this matter, the NCLT had extended the insolvency resolution period for 90 days after the creditors failed to find a suitable buyer within the initial period of 180 days as mandated under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC).",280,0.9953089356422424

ICICI Direct's research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel has announced that in all likelihood, the European Commission (EC) does not intend to clear the proposed joint venture (JV) between Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp. The EC had recently discussed the proposed joint venture between both parties. Based on the feedback received from the commission, Tata Steel believes it is being increasingly clear that EC does not intend to clear the proposed JV as it (EC) expects substantial remedies in the form of sale of assets of the proposed venture. Both parties (i.e. Tata Steel, ThyssenKrupp) are unable to offer further remedies to the commission to meet its requirement. Tata Steel had indicated the required divestments to address the EC’s concerns would considerably dilute the intended synergies of the proposed merger. Hence, both parties have assumed that the EC will not approve the potential JV. Hence, the potential JV is off the table as of now. The official communication from the EC is expected before June 17, 2019 deadline.

Outlook

While Tata Steel is further evaluating other options for the European entity, we await further developments in this regard. We value the stock on an SoTP basis and arrive at a target price of Rs 475. We downgrade the stock to HOLD recommendation.

There is unease at the UK units of Tata Steel with unions demanding assurance that the operations will not be split and sold off after the proposed joint venture with thyssenkrupp collapsed last week.

The unions had been unhappy about the remedies proposed by Tata Steel to get a nod from the European Commission for the JV. But the Commission, which was probing if the JV would hurt competition, blocked the deal.

""The Tatas offered three units totaling nearly a million tons of annual capacity. And thyssenkrupp offered only one small unit. Tata's European unions felt it was no longer a JV, but a takeover,"" a senior London-based official told Moneycontrol.

""If Thyssenkrupp had put forward a remedy then the JV would have been accepted by the Commission... It’s disappointing and frustrating from Unions view, but we did not agree with the remedies they put forward,"" the official added.

Though the joint venture is no longer on the horizon, the workers now fear Tata Steel will look for options to sell the units and that will lead to job losses.

""They want assurances that the European operations are not broken up and units are not sold off individually,"" said another executive.

""The Tatas now have to commit to the investment programme for Europe and with the right leadership the European businesses will be successful,"" said the first official quoted above.

Tata Steel's European operations include units in the UK and Netherlands, and employ about 20,000 people. The Netherlands-based unit are said to among the most profitable ones in Europe. But the UK operations have been constrained under high energy costs in the country, and legacy issues.

Tata Steel didn't respond to queries from Moneycontrol.

Looking at options

Addressing the media on a conference call on May 10, after the JV was called off, Tata Steel CEO & MD TV Narendran reiterated that the company has a few options, and is exploring them.

He also added that the UK operations should improve upon their performance this year, after a blast furnace shutdown dented numbers in 2018.

At the same time, he underlined that the units in Europe need to be cash positive.

While Executive Director & CFO Koushik Chatterjee said that the volumes in Europe should increase by 5 percent this year, the demand outlook in the continent is dim.

The management was hoping to bring some stability to the units under the JV, which would have also taken over about 15 percent of Tata Steel debt of nearly Rs 1 lakh crore.

But the circumstances have now turned.

The union leaders may again seek an appointment with Tata Steel Chairman N Chandrasekaran, whom they had met in April.

Chandrasekaran had mandated the Tata Steel leadership to get a solution for the European units. But with the JV now a failure, the management has to come up with viable options.",489,-0.3266794681549072

The collapse of Tata Steel's proposed joint venture with German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp is ""marginally credit negative"" for the Indian steel major, a global rating agency has said.

The steel major's Indian operation will largely be able to offset the impact of the collapse, it said. ""Tata Steel Ltd and Thyssenkrupp AG's decision to cease efforts on their proposed Europe joint venture is marginally credit negative for Tata Steel,"" S&P Rating said in a bulletin in the wake of the development.

This is likely to depress the ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt by about 100 basis points across our forecast horizon, it said. Tata Steel and the German conglomerate decided to call off their proposed steel joint venture (JV), expecting the deal to be rejected by the European Commission over ""continuing concerns"".

""The cancellation of the joint venture will also leave Tata Steel exposed to the weaker and more volatile performance of the European operations until the company identifies an alternative strategy to deconsolidate the European operations,"" the global rating agency said.

""However, sustained high steel prices and continued robust profitability of Tata Steel's India business remain the more important factors for our positive rating outlook on the company (BB-/positive),"" it said.

""We expect supportive steel prices and continued high utilisation in the India business to drive Tata Steel's FFO-to-debt sustainably above 15 per cent over the next six to 12 months. This is notwithstanding the drag from the retention of the Europe business and the lower-than-expected fourth- quarter profitability in 2019,"" S&P said.

The breakup of the proposed JV may also restrict the steel major to go for further acquisition in India.

""Any outsized spending by Tata Steel on new acquisitions would be a risk to our estimates, though we view this risk to be low-given that there are no large steel mills left to be auctioned in Indian bankruptcy courts,"" the bulletin said.

Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp had signed definitive agreements in June 2018 to combine their steel businesses in Europe to create a 50-50 pan European joint venture company which could have formed the continent's second-largest steel company after Lakshmi Mittal's ArcelorMittal.",367,-0.7122908575194222

Share price of steel major Tata Steel was down 7 percent intraday on Friday after sources told Reuters that Thyssenkrupp is expecting the joint venture with Tata Steel to fail.

Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel in 2018 unveiled plans to combine their steel activities in Germany, the Netherlands and Britain to become the continent’s second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal. But the landmark deal has not yet been approved due to concerns about its impact on competition.

EU antitrust regulators are concerned that the deal would lead to less choice and higher prices for steel and were increasingly likely to block it unless the companies offered greater concessions.

ThyssenKrupp said that it still saw scope for agreement with European antitrust regulators on a planned joint venture with Tata Steel despite a Financial Times report that Brussels was likely to block the deal.

A ThyssenKrupp spokesman said: “The Competition Commission has taken the reworked commitments proposed by ThyssenKrupp and Tata Steel as an opportunity to conduct another market test.” “There are still a number of ways to adjust our commitments without compromising the commercial logic of the joint venture.”

The joint venture, announced in June last year, is the biggest shake-up in Europe’s steel industry in more than a decade. To be named Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, the entity will have around 48,000 workers and about 17 billion euros (USD 19.2 billion) in sales.

Tata Steel (TATA) reported Q4FY19 earnings in line with our estimates. Adjusted for forex loss, domestic operations reported EBITDA/t in line with our estimate at Rs13,620/t (PLe:Rs13,255/t). Adjusted for one time gain related to sale of land and income from carbon credit sale, TSE delivered EBITDA/t of US$67/t (PLe:US$55). TATA Steel BSL (BSL-formerly Bhushan Steel) performance was impacted due to higher exports with EBITDA/t of Rs6,870/t (PLe:Rs8,955) however, management is optimistic to reach EBITDA/t at normal targeted level of Rs10,000.

Outlook

Exit from loss making European (TSE) and South East Asian (SEAN) operations would significantly improve the quality of earnings and Balance sheet (would reduce debt by 23% or ~Rs24bn). Merger with BSL will further strengthen domestic operations with larger focus to improve operational efficiencies and synergies. We reiterate BUY with TP of Rs685, EV/EBITDA 6x FY21e.

Since January, steel prices softened a bit on account of concerns over growth and global demand. Despite pressure on realisations, Tata Steel during Q4 FY19 reported close to 26 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in group revenue on strong volume growth.

On a consolidated basis, the company reported overall volume growth of 28.5 percent to 7.52 million tonne, largely on account of the recently acquired company: Bhushan Steel.

Tata Steel India now contributes 63 percent of its volumes and registered a domestic sales growth of 12 percent on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis. While domestic business saw lower realisations, the group's operating performance was good.

It earned an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) per tonne Rs 10,394 in Q4FY19 as against Rs 10,012 per tonne in the corresponding quarter last year. This was partly on account of Bhushan Steel, which sold 1.14 million tonne of steel during Q4 but reported a sharp reduction in EBIDTA per tonne to Rs 6,911 largely because of lower realisations (due to increase in exports and change in product mix).

The European business, however, reported robust earnings, with higher volumes. It clocked an EBIDTA per tonne of close to Rs 6,591 in the March quarter as against Rs 4,466 year-on-year.

Firm outlook on the back of volume and priceSteel prices are expected to remain firm after the elections and may even rise towards the end of FY20 as a result of higher demand. The industry expects over seven percent demand growth for steel in India.

If price environment remains conducive, Tata Steel has many levers to play. Integration of the recently acquired Bhushan Steel will help achieve higher volumes and improve overall India profitability.

The management is hoping that with the help of recent acquisition, like Bhushan Steel, which is producing around 4.1 million tonne and can rise to about 5 million tonne, and about 0.6 million tonne from the newly acquired Usha Martin assets, it can target additional one million tonne of production this fiscal.

Last year, its European operation was hit because of the shutdown of blast furnace, which is now operating at normal rate and can add to overall volumes.

Moreover, the focus is more on profitability and reduction of debt. In Bhushan Steel, there is further scope for improving profitability and the company is targeting an EBITDA per tonne between Rs 10,000 and Rs 11,000. With the divestment of South Asian Business and easing worries over its European business, its debt too should come down. It has already reduced a good amount of its debt through internal accruals. At the end of FY19, its net debt stood at Rs 94,879 core.

Valuation

This is also reflected in its valuations. At its April 25 closing price of Rs 510 per share, its stock is trading at seven times its FY20 estimated price-to-earnings, which is quite reasonable.

Tata Steel posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 2,295.2 crore for the quarter ended March 2019, down from Rs 14,688 crore posted in the same quarter last year.

Consolidated revenue for the quarter grew 25.9 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 42,423 crore in Q4FY19 from Rs 33,705 crore last year.

""Higher revenue growth reflects the increase in consolidated steel production and deliveries which rose 27 percent and 29 percent, respectively, year-on-year. Also, domestic production and deliveries, which include the numbers of Tata Steel standalone and Tata Steel BSL (Bhushan Steel) jumped 46 percent and 55 percent, respectively,"" Group Chief Financial Officer Koushik Chatterjee told reporters in a post result conference.

The consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for Q4FY19 grew 17.4 percent YoY to Rs 7,513.3 crore. However, EBITDA margin declined to 17.7 percent from 19 percent in Q4 last year.

Gross debt decreased by Rs 8,781 crore during Q4FY19. The company aims to reduce this further by $1 billion by the end of FY20.

Standalone domestic EBITDA per tonne was at Rs 13,619, down from Rs 14,835 last year.

Meanwhile, the company also announced the merger of Bamnipal Steel and Tata Steel BSL with Tata Steel, managing director and chief executive TV Narendran said, adding the shareholder of the merging companies will get one share of Tata Steel for every 15 shares they own.

With the merger, the shares held by Bamnipal Steel and the preference shares held by Tata Steel in Tata Steel BSL shall stand cancelled and so will be the shares held by the parent in Bamnipal Steel.Production outlook

The company expects its production to increase by about 1.5 million tons next year, on a consolidated basis. This will include a million tons in the India operations.

After the acquisition of Bhushan Steel, which has been renamed Tata Steel BSL, the company has three production facilities - in Jamshedpur, Kalinganagar and Angul.

The Angul facility comes under Tata Steel BSL. “It has a capacity of 5 million tons a year but was doing about 3.5 million tons when we acquired. We have increased the capacity utilisation to 4.2 million tons and this should increase further,” said CEO & Managing Director TV Narendran.

In its European operations, the production was impacted by a blast furnace shutdown. This, added Narendran, will normalise this financial year and help increase production by up to 0.7 million tons.

Giving an outlook for the year, Narendran said that the demand should recover after the General Elections get over.

“We expect prices to increase by up to Rs 1,500 a ton in this quarter,” he said.

While the auto sector saw a slowdown in demand, due to high inventories, demand remained strong construction industry. “But the residential segment within the construction sector, is weak,” said Narendran.",479,0.3028949499130249

­A lack of volume growth in its core sponge business and weak domestic sponge prices continued to weigh on Tata Sponge.

In January this year, Raipur-based sponge iron prices corrected 8 percent to about Rs 21,000 a tonne.

Tata Sponge, which operates at about 115 percent capacity utilisation is striving for volume growth. The company reported a 4.3 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in sales in Q4FY19, but sequentially, sales dropped 2.65 percent to Rs 254 crore, reflecting the correction in sponge iron prices.

Key positive

Sales in FY19 grew 21.5 percent Rs 992 crore. However, this was mostly because of the low base of last year when sponge prices were relatively low. Besides, debottlenecking of existing capacity helped increase volumes in the last year in turn leading to better YoY performance.

Key negatives

Unlike sales growth, profitability has been falling both YoY and sequentially. Despite better utilisation, the company reported a 15.2 percent YoY decline in operating profits (EBITDA) to Rs 39.3 crore in March FY19 quarter. Margins, in fact, dropped by a whopping 360 basis points to 15.5 percent.

The decline in profitability was primarily a result of higher costs. Because of the tight supply of iron ore in the domestic market and an increase in coal prices, the company which partly depends on the spot market for its raw material requirements faced cost pressures. This is also the reason that the cost of material consumed as percentage of sales spiked to 73.9 percent in March quarter from 59.13 percent in the corresponding quarter last year.

Since January this year, Chinese iron ore prices spiked 24 percent in the international market to $88 a tonne. Besides, because of capacity constraints and logistics issues, the domestic iron ore premium is weighing on the domestic manufacturers. This is also a reason for the net profits falling 48 percent YoY to Rs 24.39 crore during the quarter. For the full year too, profits dropped 11.7 percent to Rs 124 crore.

Other observations

The key development that investors are watching out is the integration of recently-acquired company Usha Martin. Tata Sponge has decided to shift its corporate office to Kolkata and change its name to Tata Steel Long Products.

This also affirms our view that Tata Sponge with the help of Usha Martin will now focus on long products and partly value-added products where Tata Steel does not have much presence.

Outlook

While on the one hand, the cost pressure is increasing, on the other, customers are seeking discount on the final products. In this situation, the company has limited ability to exercise pricing power. Since the volume game is not at play because of the peak capacity utilisation, the key would be the integration of stressed Usha Martin assets and deployment of the surplus cash in the books.

Over the next six months, this should start making a positive impact and if the market stabilises here, profitability too should be better in FY20. At Rs 747 a share or nine times its FY19 earnings, the stock is valued reasonably.",517,-0.2719147304693858

Industry experts claimed that the news, coinciding with the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, will be a feather on the cap of the Mamata Banerjee government, which has been trying to showcase Bengal as an ideal investment destination over the last few years.

In a regulatory filing, Tata Sponge Iron said its board has ""approved the shifting of the registered office of the company to West Bengal, subject to the approval of the members of the company and other regulatory authorities"".

The company, which is scheduled to hold its 36th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on July 15 in Keonjhar, has an installed sponge-iron-making capacity of 390,000 tonne a year and a 26 megawatt waste heat recovery power plant.

In the stock exchange filing, the firm also said that its board has approved a proposal to change the name of 'Tata Sponge Iron' to 'Tata Steel Long Products Limited'.

Notably, Tata Sponge has recently acquired Kolkata- based Usha Martin's steel business, which includes its Jamshedpur unit and an operative iron-ore mine, a developing coalmine, a captive power plant and certain land parcels, at a cost of Rs 4,090 crore.

The company, which reported revenues of Rs 1,049.70 crore in the financial year ending March 31, 2018, was established in 1982 as a joint venture between Tata Steel and Industrial Promotion & Investment Corporation of Orissa Ltd (Ipicol).

Ever since Tata Steel acquired Bhushan Steel through the insolvency process, investors have been eagerly waiting for the turnaround of its operation. The company, now named as Tata Steel BSL, reported its first annual results after the acquisition. The marked improvement in its sales and profitability is worth noting particularly in the light of its impact on Tata Steel’s consolidated performance.

First and foremost, the company has been putting a lot of efforts in ramping up the production and increasing utilisations. A 20 percent year-on-year increase in sales during the quarter ended in March 2019 and a 19 percent YoY growth in annual sales are clear indications of higher production.

This certainly indicates that volumes have increased as a result of higher production. This is good news for Tata Steel and reflects in its overall growth in domestic volumes. During FY19, Tata Steel has reported 34.5 percent growth in its annual steel production to 16.79 million tonne. This is after accounting for the production of close to 4.2 million tonnes of Bhushan Steel. Tata Steel has helped Bhushan to swiftly gain its lost production.

Operating gains

During the financial year 2019, Tata Steel BSL produced 4.2 million tonne of steel, which is a growth of 9.37 percent as against an annual production of 3.8 million tonnes in the financial year 2018.

What is interesting is the improvement in the profitability. During the year ended in FY19, the company’s EBIDTA worked out to close to Rs 9,044 per tonne as against Rs 5,742 per tonne in the fiscal 2018. This is a huge improvement and reflects benefits of scale and cost-saving measures undertaken by Tata Steel.

This is also critical for the profitability of Tata Steel and a positive contribution to the group profitability. During the quarter, Tata Steel BSL reported a net loss of Rs 212.4 crore, significantly lower compared to the Rs 21,252-crore loss in the similar quarter last year and the Rs 240-crore loss in the December quarter.

Outlook

Tata Steel’s domestic business earned an EBIDTA of Rs 16,240 per tonne in Q3FY19. Since the product profile of Bhushan is far superior, the expectations is that, going forward, the profitability should improve further to about Rs 11,000 a tonne in the near term.

This, along with the further scope for volumes growth, will make sure that the company should be profitable possibly by the end of the first half of the current financial year. In terms of the stock, however, we believe that it would be better to own Tata Steel than Tata Steel BSL as, considering the structure of the deal, any turnaround in the business would largely benefit Tata Steel.",459,0.995049774646759

But many of these bargains could be traps. In a two part series (Part-2), we dig into the pitfalls of investing in stocks considered cheap based on the price-to-book value metric.

Checklist when price to book value becomes a trap:- When the stated value of assets in the books is higher than their realisable value

- When a company’s balance sheet contains too many intangibles

- When the company has huge contingent liabilities

- When a large part of the liability is shifted to the future

During times of stress in the market, investors hunt for bargains and one valuation yardstick used by most of them is price-to-book value. However, there are many pitfalls of using this measure, often ignored by investors.

We detail seven such ways in which P/B value as a tool of valuation can turn out to be a trap for bargain hunters. The first four are listed below, the rest will be discussed in Part 2.

Case 1: When the stated value of assets in the books is higher than their realisable valueIn the last few years, many companies including Tata Steel, GMR Infrastructure and others took huge write-offs, knocking down the value of assets sitting in their books.

For example, in the September quarter of FY19, Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) reported a net loss of Rs 1,525 crore as against a profit of Rs 11 crore in the year ago quarter as the company wrote off its entire investments in Lavasa -- a subsidiary of HCC, which has been referred to the bankruptcy court. While HCC has a negative net worth and book value, had it happened to any healthy company the book value per share would have dropped significantly.

Tata Steel has written off its investment in Europe and took a hit because of the difference in realisable value compared to its stated value. Companies often indulge in a waiting game, postponing such value erosion till a day when it becomes unbearable. What’s more, not just fixed assets but the value of inventories and receivables too could be inflated in the books.

Case 2: Does the company’s balance sheet show a very large amount of intangibles?In March 2013, a well-known education company, Core Education, saw a big crash in its share price from about Rs 300 to Rs 60 a share, trading at 0.35 times its book value of about Rs 170 per share. Investors who thought it was a bargain relying on its book value lost out, as most of its assets were deployed in intangibles such as goodwill, which amounted to 72 percent of its FY14 net worth. Trading in the stock has currently been suspended and it last traded at Rs 1.77 a share in 2016.

In the Indian context there are many cases where the share of intangibles as a part of capital is high. And since earnings-based valuations are assigned to these companies, share prices drift far from reality.

Sanjay Bakshi, Professor at MDI Gurgaon said, “Ben Graham cites an example in his book. He wrote about a person who owns five trucks and the business is doing well because there is a shortage of trucks and freight rates are high. Now imagine that he wants to sell his business. If the business was a listed company, then it might sell for, say, 15 times earnings in the stock market. But when you multiply earnings by 15, you get a valuation which is three times the replacement cost of the five trucks.”

Bakshi added, “By using this example, Graham showed the dangers of relying on price-to-earnings multiple for valuation in cyclical businesses with low-entry barriers. He wrote that in a private business no one will pay more than the depreciated value of the five trucks because that’s what the businesses is really worth. There might be a small premium for goodwill in the business, but not much. And so Graham recommended the use of asset values as a sanity check over valuations models that only used earnings.”

A book value which is supported by hard assets compared to intangible assets such as goodwill, trademark, patents and others needs to be factored in. In bad times, like in the case of Kingfisher Airlines, its brand had no real value. In such a case, the book value, which includes intangibles, would be misleading for investors. Hence, it is important to look for hard assets. Book values need to be supported by something tangible such as replacement value.

Citing another instance, Bakshi pointed out, “There are some investors who look at low price-to-replacement cost of assets. Take the example of Bruce Flatt of Brookfield, which follows this philosophy of investing in hard assets. Brookfield is investing in many hard assets in India (pipelines, hotels, etc) today, where the replacement cost is much higher than the price paid even though the current earnings are low.""

Case 3: When the company has huge contingent liabilitiesJet Airways, which has negative net worth of Rs 7,139 crore, is sitting on contingent liabilities of over Rs 7,000 crore including several tax demands. Outside the balance sheet, there could be huge contingent liabilities, often overlooked by investors, sitting on its books in the form of corporate guarantees, possible future damages arising out of lawsuits or any other dispute that might result in a financial loss. In view of such liabilities and possible losses, the book value would be inflated, although the stock may be perceived to be cheap based on the stated net worth of the company.

“Companies which do aggressive accounting may resort to such practices of postponing their liabilities. In this case, investors needs to adjust for the potential impact of contingent liabilities to get the actual value,” Amit Mantri, a value investor and Fund Manager with 2point2 Capital PMS, said.

Case 4: When a large part of the liability is shifted to the futureWhile accounting should ensure that the books reveal a true picture of the company’s current affairs, financial engineers are often seen shifting their immediate liabilities to the future to shore up profits. Practices such as wrongly capitalising interest cost or showing it as debt in the Balance Sheet instead of deducting it from the Profit & Loss Account are not uncommon.

For instance, banks in the past used to restructure their stressed loans or provide fresh loans against stressed loans to a group company to regularise the account so that they can avoid immediate provisioning. When the banking norms changed, these hitherto hidden provisioning requirements made a sudden appearance, which led to severe erosion in the book value of banks.

“Relying on stated book value can be risky because of improper accounting. For example, many state-run banks are today selling at low multiples of stated book value, but the correct book value is much lower,"" Bakshi added. Such stocks are traps for the unwary investor.

Deepak ShenoyCapitalmind

The Bhushan Steel resolution gave the company to Tata Steel, which renamed it to Tata Steel BSL, which continues to be listed. The latest price, Rs 34 per share.

This is interesting. Because, till now, the shareholding was like this:

-Tata Steel (through Bamnipal Steel): 79 crore shares (72 percent)

-Banks: 11 crore shares (10 percent)

-Others: 19 crore shares (18 percent)

-Total: 109 crore shares.

That’s a market cap of around Rs 3,500 crore so far.

Tata Steel Will Invest Rs 9,000 crore at Rs 30.43 per share

Tata Steel will now buy more shares. This is an indirect route: Bhushan Steel will issue Rs 9,000 crore worth Optionally Convertible Preference Shares. These can be converted to Bhushan Steel (TATASTLBSL) shares at Rs 30.43 per share.

The shareholding will eventually take them to 92.6 percent ownership. From their PR release:

So, if they convert all the shares:

-Tata Steel will own 92.6 percent of Tata Steel BSL (old Bhushan Steel) with about 375.2 crore shares.

-Banks will be diluted down to 2.7 percent

-And others to 4.7 percent

Totally there will be 404 crore equity shares.

Is this Good, Bad or Ugly?

It’s actually much much better than we earlier thought. Our view was that the first tranche of shares (79 crore odd) was issued to Tata Steel at Rs 2 per share. So they would convert the rest at Rs 2 also and therefore, see a massive dilution.

This is still massive, but not quite as much.

Also importantly, the Convertible shares carry an interest of 8.89 percent a year. That means about Rs 800 crore of interest will have to be paid on them till the conversion. We’ll come to this.

The Tata Steel management didn’t do that – possibly because of regulation itself. The SEBI rules will not allow such a deal if it wasn’t part of the bankruptcy resolution itself. In the Bhushan Steel resolution, they didn’t mention specifically how much they would convert the optionally convertible shares at, even later. So they might have had to abide by the regulations that SEBI provided, and Rs 30 was a reasonable deal given the circumstances (the share traded at Rs 40 in January, but slid back to Rs 26 in February).

How do you now value a Bhushan Steel (TATASTLBSL)?

If you look at the interest component on what they have to pay – they will have about 26,000 crore of debt remaining. (Tata Steel put in Rs 35,000 crore and this Rs 9,000 crore is now going to be converted to shares). Tata Steel has issued themselves that debt at about 11 percent, meaning that interest costs will be about 2,900 crore. There is about Rs 1,200 crore of depreciation per year.

EBIDTA per tonne could be pushed up to Rs 10,000 per tonne, which for Bhushan Steel at 50 lakh tonnes means an EBIDTA of Rs 5,000 crore.

Subtract the depreciation and interest, and you have about Rs 900 crore in profit. Assuming you pay 30 percent tax, that’s a net profit of Rs 650 crore.

A P/E multiple of 10 would provide an equity value of Rs 6,500.

Spread across 404 crore shares, this is about a price of Rs. 16 per share.

That would mean the current price of Rs 34 is a little high.

(Note that if there is no conversion, an additional Rs 800 crore is paid as interest, that brings net profit to zero. That’s not fun.)

How about EV-EBIDTA?

Steel companies could be valued another way: EV to EBIDTA. EV = Enterprise Value = Equity Plus Debt.

Debt is about Rs 26,000 crore (after Rs 9,000 crore is converted to equity).

For an EBIDTA of Rs 5,000 crore, let’s also crosscheck what EV-EBIDTA we are paying for Tata Steel itself. The answer is about six times. JSW Steel is seven times.

Let’s give Bhushan a 6.5x and say that the EV is 5000 x 6.5 = Rs 33,000 crore.

At that point, debt is Rs 26,000 crore so the equity is valued at Rs 7,000 crore.

Again, for 404 crore shares this is a price of Rs 17.5 per share.

To justify a price of Rs 32 per share, you need an EV-EBIDTA of 7.5+. This is possible in a good market (however, most steel companies are trading below those valuations today).

The Verdict: Much Better Outcome Than Earlier

This is an interesting outcome, because Tata Steel chose to convert at Rs 30 per share. At some level, this provides a valuation base to the company. Of course, at current relative valuations, the price is still way too high (we estimate that if it were valued as per its peers, the share should be below Rs 20 per share).

But still, there are questions – all these valuation estimates assume conversion. If Tata Steel does convert they could quickly force a delisting of the company, since they will have more than 90 percent. And then, shareholders may not be able to exit in any meaningful way.

We expect that the Tata’s will play nice here – and either merge the company with Tata Steel, at a possible conversion price closer to Rs 30 per share (effectively) after conversion. Eventually, of course, the future will depend on the performance of Tata Steel. That performance hasn’t been all that great, even with a steel upcycle. A return of capex planning in the economy would do it a lot of good, so the real verdict will have to be after the budget later this year.

For Bhushan Steel (Now Tata Steel BSL) shareholders, this conversion must be a sigh of relief, because it provides clarity on exactly what the minority shareholders will own in this business.

Tata Steel said it is targeting to double the proportion of women working on its shopfloor to 10 percent of the total workforce by 2025.

The Tata group company has 5 percent of its overall 35,000 employees or about 1,750 women working on the shopfloor at present, a company official said.

In a statement, the company further said it will create more avenues for women to grow in the technical/ manufacturing domain.

In a fillip for the 2025 goal, the company has begun to include women working on the shopfloor in two additional shifts at the flagship Jamshedpur plant, which has helped the fairer sex be present in the factory between 6 am and 10 pm.

A company official explained that women have been on the shopfloor for many years, but used to work only in the general 9 am-5 pm shift.

Tata Steel had to make a slew of changes in the workplace in adherence of local rules in Jharkhand to help make it possible for women to work in shifts, he added.

These include conducting sensitisation sessions for the employees, set-up security systems, creating women role models as ambassadors and meeting families of women, the statement said.

After the efforts, 52 women are working on the shopfloor across different shifts at the coke plant and electrical repair shopfloor at its over a century old plant, it added.

""Going forward, we hope to expand this further to include more departments that will open-up for women,"" its vice president human resource management Suresh Dutt Tripathi was quoted as saying.

The Jharkhand plant has 20,000 workers, of which 1,300 are women. The women employees include 500 officers who are not on the shopfloor and 800 non-officers, including the 52, who man the shopfloor, the official explained.",305,0.9999120235443115

Tata Steel's European unit may have to put its UK facilities on the block as it works with partner thyssenkrupp to get their proposed joint venture cleared by the European Union Commission.

The Commission, which is probing if the JV harms competition, on April 1 said that the two companies have offered 'concessions' to address its concerns. The agency though didn't give details, and has extended the deadline to give its decision on the deal from May 13 to June 5.

""Much of the concession may happen in the UK operations of Tata Steel, which could end up having minimal presence there,"" said a senior executive from the industry.

The joint venture will be the second largest steelmaker in Europe, behind ArcelorMittal. It will have annual revenues of 17 billion euros and will produce 21 million tons of steel a year.

The Commission had identified three industry segments - automotive steel, coated steel used for packaging and electrical steel - where the JV may harm competition.

In packaging, the Welsh business of Tata Steel UK could be on the block. A similar unit in Netherlands, where Tata Steel Europe has a major presence, is profitable, and so is thyssenkrupp's unit. So it will be the Welsh unit that will look out for new owners.

In electrical steel segment, Tata Steel has already put its Cogent unit, again in Wales, on the block. thyssenkrupp's electric steel unit is highly profitable and may be retained under the JV.

""For automotive steel, Tata Steel could shift or sell some of its product line, which will be again from Wales. This would mean that Tata Steel UK will have nominal presence post this,"" said an official.

Reports from European media have said that thyssenkrupp may also offer some of its glavanising units to clear the EU probe.

The JV, which will be called thysenkrupp Tata Steel BV, will be led by Andreas Goss, who is currently CEO of the German company's steel division.

The prospect of these units coming on block has already evoked interest. Germany's steelmaker Salzgitter AG has said that it will look at assets that will be divested by the Tata Steel UK-thyssenkrupp JV.

The two steelmakers on March 20 agreed to an eight-day extension to a deadline for submitting remedies to the European Commission, which has been concerned that the combined entity could hurt competition in some areas.

The people said no final decisions have been made and remedy proposals could still change or be amended before the new April 1 deadline. The Commission aims to wrap up its antitrust investigation into Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp's tie-up by May 13.

Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel last year agreed to combine their European steel activities in a 50-50 joint venture to cut overcapacity and create a more powerful challenger to market leader ArcelorMittal.

Offering some packaging steel assets would address one of the areas that have been singled out by the Commission in its antitrust review. Under their deal, both companies would own about half of the European packaging steel market, industry sources have said.

Thyssenkrupp declined to comment. A spokesman for Tata Steel said it was not appropriate to comment or speculate on the process. ""Both companies are committed to working closely with all relevant regulators to ensure the success of this transaction,"" he said.

In the financial year 2017/2018, Tata Steel Europe made 1.03 billion euros ($1.2 billion) of sales from packaging steel for food, paint and aerosol cans, among others, accounting for about 13 percent of total revenues.

This is only slightly less than the 1.16 billion euros generated by Thyssenkrupp's packaging steel unit Rasselstein in 2015/2016, according to the latest available company data. This business will not be part of the remedy offer, the people said.

In packaging, Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel are both active in the production of tinplate and blackplate.

Another area of concern for the Commission is electrical steel, where Tata Steel last year put its Cogent business on the block. The companies hope that the disposal plans will be sufficient to avoid further remedies, the people said.

German steel giant ThyssenKrupp on Wednesday said that it has applied for an eight-day extension to complete ongoing negotiations with the European Commission over its planned merger with Tata Steel.

The Commission had opened an ""in-depth"" investigation into the proposed merger in October last year and noted its concerns that the deal between the two steel majors may reduce competition in the supply of various high-end steels.

""We have agreed to apply for an extension by 8 working days as part of the constructive dialogue with the Commission,"" a ThyssenKrupp spokesperson told PTI.

As part of the transaction announced in June last year, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp plan to combine their European carbon steel and electrical steel businesses in a joint venture.

The European Commission, the executive arm of the 28-member economic bloc, said its initial market investigation raised several issues, relating in particular to combining both companies' offer of certain specialty flat carbon steel and electrical steel products.

The Commission said it is concerned that, following the transaction, customers would face a reduced choice in suppliers, as well as higher prices.

""These customers include various European companies, ranging from major corporations to numerous small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). Many compete with imported products in the EEA, or export their products outside Europe and compete globally,"" the Commission said in a statement.

The Tata-ThyssenKrupp transaction was notified to the European Commission in September 2018 and had 90 working days to take a decision, a period which ended this Tuesday.

For a trade union that owes its origin to a strike, Tata Steel's Tata Workers' Union has come a long way, 99 years to be precise. It is the only union in the country to have lasted so long.

Ironically, the secret of its longevity - and again in contrast to its origin - would be its relative peacefulness when it comes to labour relations. The TWU, as the union is called, has not had a strike since 1928.

Based in Tata Steel's Jamshedpur facility, TWU was founded in March 1920.

""The secret to our longevity is our working style. We work together with the management and there is a trust factor. Sure, we have issues and demands, and sometimes it takes time to come to a decision, but the bottomline is trust,"" TWU President R Ravi Prasad told Moneycontrol.

A political history

The TWU has a rich history, and stalwarts of the time, including Mahatma Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose, have had some association with it.

Then known as Labour Association, the union was de-recognised by the management in 1922, in response to a strike for better service conditions. It was only after the intervention of Gandhi, who visited Jamshedpur in 1925, that the recognition was restored, and Bose was made the President.

Its 1956 agreement with the management is known as the 'magna carta' of the working class, bringing better benefits, and also enabling workers' representation across the organisational structure.

There has been some violence too. Two of its presidents - Abdul Bari in 1947 and VG Gopal in 1993 - were gunned down.

Some of the most trying circumstances also included the massive restructuring that the company underwent under the helm of then managing director JJ Irani. From 78,000 in 1991, the workforce was brought down to about 40,000 over the next 10 years. There were differences, but no strikes despite the massive initiative.

""The change is the secret of the company's health,"" said Prasad, who has spent 22 years in the company. He is equally unperturbed about talks of automation taking away jobs.

""We have to train people and we have to adjust. Otherwise, it is not possible to survive. We want the company to be strong,"" said the union leader. Interestingly, TWU has had only 11 presidents in its near 100 years.

Keeping politics out

Another secret behind TWU's century-long run would be its arm's length distance from anything politics. This, despite the union being affiliated to Indian National Trade Union Congress, the trade union wing of Indian National Congress.

""We are not political. We keep good relations with all political parties, but we keep a distance,"" says Prasad.

On centenary celebrations, the union plans to release a book, hold a 'big event' that will have a leading political figure as the chief guest, and the annual lecture will be addressed by Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran.",492,0.3433159689108531

Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday upgraded Tata Steel's corporate family rating, reflecting the sustained improvement in the company's credit profile.

The corporate family ratings (CFRs) are opinions of a corporate group's ability to honour all of its financial obligations, according to Moody's. ""Moody's Investors Service has upgraded Tata Steel's CFR to Ba2 from Ba3.

The outlook has been changed to stable from positive,"" Moody's said in a statement.

The CFR upgrade reflects the sustained improvement in the company's credit profile, stemming mainly from strong operating efficiencies and vertical integration, as well as stable demand and price conditions in its major market, Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody's VP, said.

Tata Steel's CFR is supported by its significant, diversified and growing operating base and its globally cost competitive steel operations in India, Moody's said.

These factors, alongside favourable industry dynamics in key operating market in India have translated into the company's sustained track record of improving credit metrics, it said.

""Tata Steel's key market is still India, which accounts for 57 per cent of its global steel volumes sold, 54 per cent of consolidated revenues, and 85 per cent of consolidated EBITDA, a result of the strong operating environment and the company's backward integration into producing its key own raw materials of iron ore and coking coal,"" Moody's said.

During April-December 2018-19, Tata Steel's Indian operations generated EBITDA/ a tonne of Rs 17,270, more than three times the profitability of its European operations, it added.

Consequently, strong growth prospects in India augur well for Tata Steel. Also, the successful integration of Bhushan Steel in 2018 and the proposed acquisition of the steel business of Usha Martin have further cemented the steel major's business profile.

The stable outlook reflects Moody's expectation that Tata Steel's strong operating performance will translate into a sustained improvement in credit metrics.

""The stable outlook also incorporates Moody's expectation that Tata Steel will remain selective in its acquisitions, funding them with a prudent mix of debt and equity and allowing only a temporary spike in adjusted debt/EBITDA leverage,"" it said.

Tata Steel is the world's 10th largest steel company by production capacity, achieving 25.1 million tonne of crude steel production in 2017.

""At March 31, 2018, its nameplate capacity totalled 27.5 MTPA, of which, 12.7 MT was in India, 12.4 MT in Europe and 2.4 MT in Southeast Asia,"" Moody's said.",401,0.9586033821105957

Unlike Monnet Ispat, whose assets were acquired at dirt cheap valuation, JSW Steel’s bid of Rs 19,700 crore for Bhushan Power & Steel is less attractive. This is far higher than its own initial bid of Rs 11,000 crore, largely because of competing bids from rivals such as Tata Steel.

While the details are not yet available, the deal would also be looked from the perspective of immediate scalability, working capital, synergy benefits and adjoining land bank. After adjusting for the capital work in progress of about Rs 6,000-7,000 crore, Bhushan Power & Steel’s operational capacity of about 2.5 million tonne (total capacity of 3.5 million tonne) is valued at about Rs 6,000 crore per million tonne, which is closer to its replacement value.

Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel are planning to combine their European steel activities to create the continent's No. 2 steelmaker after ArcelorMittal, raising concerns that far-reaching remedies are required to secure antitrust approval.

The European Commission is expected to outline its competitive concerns about the merger this week, calling on the two firms to offer compromises to avert a potential veto.

""We won't support a merger at any price,"" Markus Grolms, vice chairman of Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board and secretary at IG Metall, Germany's biggest labour union, told Reuters on Wednesday.

""We have always defined a red line with regard to the merger control proceedings. If this line is crossed we won't give our support,"" Grolms said, without saying where the line would be drawn.

Shares in the group traded 3.2 percent lower at 1124 GMT, dropping to a fresh three-year low.

Several brokerages cut their price targets following weak first-quarter results on February 12.

Grolms said Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board, where labour representatives hold 10 of the 20 seats, would have to vote on the outcome of remedy negotiations between the company and the Commission.

They could be outvoted by Chairwoman Martina Merz, who has a casting vote in case of a draw, but this would be unprecedented and would go against Thyssenkrupp's long-standing tradition of making large restructuring moves with labour support.

Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff a day earlier said the Commission's statement of objections, expected at the end of the week, was not unusual given the transaction's size. He said it gave no reason for fresh concerns.

The steel-to-submarines group is still confident it can complete the deal in early 2019. The European Commission will rule on the transaction by April 29.

""We've always been straight about this and have already confronted (former CEO Heinrich) Hiesinger with our concern that the risks from merger control proceedings are either underestimated or deliberately downplayed by management,"" Grolms said.

The steel joint venture is a key part of Thyssenkrupp's transformation plan, which also includes a planned spin-off of its elevator, car parts and plant engineering units to form a separately listed entity.",384,-0.6136469046274821

There are about 250 subsidiaries with 29 jointly-controlled companies and 32 associates that get consolidated every time Tata Steel reports its results. What creates an element of surprise and curiosity every time is the nature of transactions and adjustments.

Analysts often tend to fumble at the company's earnings conference call despite having consumed a lot of time in understanding the adjustments including one-offs in the reported numbers.

On its part, the company has been making efforts to disclose several of these adjustments and simplify them separately in the presentations like showing performa results and actual results to help gauge the actual picture.

Despite this, the management could not answer some queries raised in the December quarter analyst call on the difference in pro forma and actual numbers, considering the several layers related to intergroup adjustments. The management suggested analysts seek clarity on some issues such as on the operation of subsidiaries like Tata Blue Scope, separately after the call.

Signs of volatility

In the first nine months of the current fiscal, the company reported other expenses of close to Rs 37,871 crore, an extraordinarily high amount on a sales turnover of Rs 122,597 crore. The nature of these expenses vary and are not well understood, raising curiosity in the minds of investors and analysts.

Analysts questioned the sudden spurt of about Rs 1,100 crore in the other expenses in the quarter. The result presentation noted Rs 300 crore was on account of forex adjustments but there were no details on the balance. While the management generally has these details handy, they said each of these expense runs into several accounting heads. The absence of such finer details, particularly the inclusion of many one-off expenses, requires investors to base their estimates on a lot of assumptions causing earnings uncertainty.

We analysed the sales and net profits of the company for the past 13 quarters or roughly three fiscals. During this period, the median sales growth fluctuation on a quarter-on-quarter basis was about 5 percent, whereas net profit growth fluctuation ranged from -682 percent to 696 percent. While steel cycle is partly responsible, a lot of this is because of the adjustments that are largely unpredictable and unknown in nature.

Divergence a new normal

Constant inconsistency often leads to estimates not matching reported numbers, sending analysts scrambling to find the missing link. Take the case of the last two quarters. In Q3FY19, the company's net profit was Rs 1,753 crore, a tad lower than the street expectations of Rs 2,200-2,300 crore. But, in Q2FY19, the net profit was Rs 3,013 crore as against the expectations of Rs 1,563 crore. Another factor that points to the inconsistency is the fact that Tata Steel was second in the list of companies that saw the highest earnings upgrades (FY19 earnings) after the Q2FY19 results.

One big cause for this variation is adjustments in the expenditures and incomes. During the quarter ended December 2018, it reported consolidated EBITDA of close to Rs 6,734 crore, whereas the adjusted EBITDA was Rs 7,225 crore, higher by about Rs 490 crore. The notes explain this variation to be on account of “adjusted for fair value changes on account of exchange rate movement on investments in Tata Steel Holdings and revaluation of gain or loss on external or internal company debts or receivables at Tata Steel Global Holdings”

The light at the end of the tunnel

The good news is, on its part, Tata Steel is making efforts to simplify the structure and it has already entered into various agreements to exit south East Asian business as well as transfer its most troubled European business under a JV without any recourse of liability to its standalone operations. While there may be scope for more, this will simplify the structure and the adjustments that are visible today.

Such accounting complexities bring to mind what Charlie Munger, the partner of Warren Buffett once said: “Double-entry bookkeeping was a hell of an invention. And it’s not that hard to understand. But you have to know enough about it to understand its limitations because although accounting is the starting place, it’s only a crude approximation. And it’s not very hard to understand its limitations. For example, everyone can see that you have to more or less just guess at the useful life of a jet airplane or anything like that. Just because you express the depreciation rate in neat numbers doesn’t make it anything you really know.”

Tata Steel UK's Chief Executive Officer Bimlendra Jha has put in his papers, at a time when the European operations of the steel major enter a crucial phase in its proposed joint venture with thyssenkrupp.

A unit of Tata Steel Europe, Tata Steel UK has operations in the UK, Sweden and Canada.

Jha, a Tata Steel lifer, was the chief executive of the operations since 2016. He was also an Executive Director on the Board of Tata Steel Europe, and a member of the Executive Committee.

He will be partly replaced by Ashish Anupam, who was Chief Executive Officer and President at NatSteel Holdings, the Singapore unit of Tata Steel.

The Indian company recently divested its stake in NatSteel, and other assets in South East Asia. It had signed an agreement with China's HBIS Group for the same.

Anupam, added sources, will take over some of the Long Products units that Jha was expected to take over.

A Tata Steel spokesperson confirmed the development. ""Yes, Jha has resigned and Ashish Anupam, presently with NatSteel Singapore, will step in to oversee some of the businesses,"" he said.

Jha, who is currently in London, recalled his stint at the steel major.

""Tata Steel is a great institution. In nearly three decades with the group, I have had much to learn and to give back to society,"" he told Moneycontrol.

At the same time, he noted the challenges too.

""In UK, I am proud to see the steel industry stabilising and protecting tens of thousands of jobs under a distributed ownership. The situation of intensive care, however, persists as the global headwinds grow. We may be safe for now but not yet secure.""

""As I leave with fond memories and great friendships, I wish my colleagues and societal stakeholders the very best for the future,"" added Jha, who joined Tata Steel has a graduate trainee in 1990, after completing his engineering from Banaras Hindu University.

In 2010, he was appointed Vice President, Long products, and later moved to the European operations. He was initially Executive Director, Group Strategy & Supply Chain, and was later appointed Executive Chairman, Long Steel, UK. In 2016, he was elevated to the post of CEO.

Jha said that he is returning to India, and has accepted a new role. ""I'm constrained to speak about my next role. Suffice to say that it is not in a competing space,"" he said.

While the exit of Jha, a seasoned professional rated highly by his peers, will not hamper the joint venture with thyssenkrupp, ""Tata Steel will miss his experience, which was across segments and geographies,"" said a senior executive from the industry.

The partnership has come under intense scrutiny of European Union's antitrust regulators.

Reuters reported on Monday that the regulator could veto the proposed joint venture, unless the two partners agreed to offer concessions.

The joint venture will be called thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, and will have a combined capacity of 27.5 million tons a year.",498,0.015807817379633587

Tata Steel gains but most global brokerage firms slashed their 12-month target price post December quarter results as the margins are likely to remain under pressure, and any price increase in India is challenging given high inventory at the country level and rising production at SAIL and JSPL, suggest experts.

Tata Steel reported a surge of 53 percent (year-on-year) in its net profit for the December quarter at Rs 1,751 crore. The company had reported a profit of Rs 1,144 crore during the same quarter of last year.

The revenue has risen 23 percent at Rs 41,219 crore versus Rs 33,446.6 crore that was posted by the company last year. At an operating level, consolidated EBITDA declined 25 percent QoQ to Rs 6,700 crore in 3QFY19, led by lower volumes globally and the shrinkage in spreads in standalone (S/A), Europe (TSE) and South East Asia (SEA).

Analysts at top brokerage firms remain watchful of Tata Steel as most of them have slashed their 12-month target price post December quarter results.

JP Morgan maintained its overweight call on Tata Steel post Q3 results but reduced its target to Rs 880 from Rs 980 earlier. The December quarter results were largely in-line with estimates.

There are twin tailwinds in terms of higher iron ore and European JV which is not yet priced in. The global investment bank raised EPS estimates by 4 percent for FY19 but warns of an upside risk to estimates if current iron ore price strength sustains. It slashed valuation multiple from 6.5x to 6x.

Another global brokerage firm, Credit Suisse maintained its outperform rating but slashed its target price to Rs 628 from 860 earlier.

Tata Steel reported weak India business performance in Q3. It slashed EBITDA estimates for both India & Europe going ahead. It slashed FY19/20e EPS to 24%/26%, and remain watchful on events around the JV with ThyssenKrupp.

Motilal Oswal maintained sell rating on Tata Steel with a target price of Rs 370. The company has highly profitable operations in India, but its capital allocation and the track record of turning around acquired assets have been poor.

Both Bhushan Steel and Usha Martin’s steel business acquisitions have been expensive, which will drag earnings for years, warns the domestic brokerage firm.

The recent loss of iron ore production at Vale post breach of a tailing dam has pushed up iron ore and scrap by 15-20%, which will eventually move steel prices higher on the slightest recovery in steel demand and can drive up the stock for some time, but it is unlikely to be sustainable.

“Price increase in India is challenging, given high inventory at the country level and rising production at SAIL and JSPL. Our sum-of-parts valuations suggest equity valuation of Rs 370/share. Maintain Sell,” it said.",472,-0.6199819048245748

Tata Steel reported a surge of 53 percent (year on year) in its net profit for the December quarter at Rs 1,751 crore. The company had reported a profit of Rs 1,144 crore during the same quarter of last year.

The revenue has risen 23 percent at Rs 41,219 crore versus Rs 33,446.6 crore that was posted by the company last year.

At an operating level, the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 18 percent to Rs 6,723.9 crore against Rs 5,697 crore reported last year.

The operating margin came in marginally lower at 16.3 percent against 17 percent last year.

“The market environment for the industry was challenging during the quarter with softening of steel prices,"" said Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and CFO. ""Our consolidated gross debt has declined by Rs 9,083 crores during the quarter including de-leveraging of over Rs.6,000 crore,"" he added.

Sale of its 70 percent stake in units in South East Asia, will further help the company bring down its debt.

By region

On geographies, India business revenue rose 10 percent at Rs 17,173.9 crore against Rs 15,595.8 crore last year.

The Europe business revenue rose 8 percent at Rs 15,850.5 crore against Rs 14,692.7 crore in the corresponding quarter of last year.

Meanwhile, rest of the world business revenues grew 39.6% at Rs 202.1 crore against Rs 144.7 crore last year.

Outlook

While the industry saw steel demand and prices softening, the company expects both to pick up in the fourth quarter.

The company expects domestic demand to recover, aided by an improving liquidity position in the economy.

""Regional steel prices have seen a marginal up-tick and are expected to improve further driven by expected demand pick-up in China post Chinese new year holidays; recently announced demand stimulating measures should also aid recovery,"" said the company in a presentation.",320,0.5422426828971276

Fitch Ratings on Thursday said Tata Steel's plan to sell majority stake in South-east Asia business will improve its leverage profile.

As part of its strategic plan to exit non-core markets and focus more on the fast-growing home market, the domestic steel giant Monday signed an agreement to sell 70 per cent stake each in its two Southeast Asian arms to the HBIS Group of China for around USD 480 million.

Tata Steel's wholly owned subsidiary T S Global Holdings signed definitive agreements with HBIS Group to divest majority stake in its South-East Asia business.

""Tata Steel Ltd's (TSL's) agreement to sell a majority stake in its south-east Asian steel-making operations will improve its leverage profile and allow it to focus on growing its highly profitable Indian business. However, we estimate the reduction in leverage to be limited due to the relatively minor nature of the assets,"" Fitch Ratings said in a statement.

The transaction will also allow TSL to increase its focus on growth in ndia, where it benefits from relatively fast demand growth and high rofitability due to captive iron-ore and coal production, it added.

The agency also said that further acquisitions and weak steel prices may also hurt TSL's financial profile.

TSL recently acquired Bhushan Steel Ltd and acquisition of Usha Martin Ltd's steel business is likely to be completed by March 2019, it said, adding the company is open to further acquisitions for the additional 5 MTPA of capacity to achieve its 30 MTPA goal.",261,0.49999919533729553

Tata Steel on Tuesday marked a new start at one of the UK's largest steelworks at Port Talbot in Wales with the relaunch of a blast furnace at a cost of ""tens of millions of pounds"".

The life extension project of Blast Furnace 5, described by the Indian steel giant as the ""biggest single investment"" in its European operations in over five years, is seen as a critical part of its long-term strategy to strengthen its operations in the UK.

""This project demonstrates our commitment to building a stronger and more sustainable steelmaking business in the UK, now and in the future,"" said Hans Fischer, Chief Wxecutive of Tata Steel's European operations.

In reference to the impact of Brexit on the company's operations, he said that Tata Steel would hope for a last-minute deal that does not result in a hard Brexit.

Fischer noted, ""When you look to our production, more than 70 per cent stays in the UK. So directly the impact of Brexit is maybe not that big. But if our customers are impacted very heavily then that immediately leads to a disturbance in the supply chain and that immediately leads to disturbances in our productions as well. In the short term that's what I'm really worried about"".

Tuesday's furnace restart, attended by Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, is expected to extend the operational life of one of two blast furnaces at the plant.

Tata Steel said engineers drained the giant furnace last year in order to carry out vital engineering work, extending its life by five to seven years. Following the relighting of the furnace, the first iron has now been produced and turned into a finished steel product before being delivered to a manufacturing business in the UK.

Once the heart of the furnace, which is normally more than 1,200 degrees Celsius, cooled in 2018, skilled engineers replaced part of the heat resistant interior and vital structural parts.

""The waste gas and dust extraction system was also replaced. The final part of the process involved the hot blast main being opened, injecting air at 1,100 degrees Celsius, bringing the furnace roaring back to life,"" said Tata Steel in a statement.

This project had been announced in June 2018, alongside the announcement of definitive agreements being signed by Germany's Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel to form a joint venture of their European steel businesses.

Tata Steel is one of Europe's leading steel producers, with steelmaking in the Netherlands and the UK and manufacturing plants across Europe. The company claims to supply ""high-quality"" steel products across different markets such as construction and infrastructure, automotive, packaging and engineering.",450,0.4982181787490845

Sustained trades above 11,000 may induce a rally towards 11,200. On the other hand, breakdown below 10,800 may trigger short-term bearishness in the market.

Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 7-10% return in next 1 month:

Dishman Carbogen: Buy| LTP: Rs.219.25 | Target: Rs 240| Stop loss: Rs 212| Return 9.50%

On the daily chart, the stock has given a downwards consolidation breakout which suggests a reversal of the previous downtrend. The rise in price was backed by increased volume.

On the daily chart, a positive divergence in the RSI (14) is seen which is likely to initiate a positive breadth in the stock. Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 1390-1400 for the target of Rs 1470-1500 and a stop loss below Rs 1349.

A weak day of trade for D-Street as benchmark indices slipped below their crucial support levels in the last 1 hour of trading session weighed down by muted results from ITC for December quarter, global growth and trade war concerns.

Let’s look at the final tally – the S&P BSE Sensex plunged 336 points while the Nifty50 closed below 10900 levels at 10,831. The index took support near 200-DMA placed around 10830.

FMCG sector remained the worst performer today with ITC losing more than 4% in trade after the company reported a decline in margins in Q3 FY19 numbers.

Nifty is consolidating in a narrow range since the past week. The immediate range for the market is seen at 10775-11000. A breakout above 11000 is expected to infuse further positivity.

Markets likely to remain volatile in short-term over increasing concerns w.r.t. global economic slowdown. Volatility in crude oil price & INR (vs USD) would keep the market participants on edge, along with December quarter earnings.

The Indian rupee on Wednesday snapped its three-day losing streak and settled higher by 11 paise at 71.33 against the US dollar on increased selling of the American currency by exporters and banks.

On the institutional front, FPI were net sellers in Indian markets of Rs 775 crore while the DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 583 crore, according to provisional data.

Big News:

On the earnings front, 69 companies will report results for the quarter ended December later today which include names like Biocon, Yes Bank, UltraTech Cements, Colgate Palmolive, PNB Housing Finance etc. among others.

Yes Bank: PAT likely to grow by 15% YoY to Rs 1245 crore

Biocon: PAT likely to grow by 75% YoY to Rs 161 crore

UltraTech Cement: PAT likely to grow by 66% YoY to Rs 530 crore

(All estimates are from Motilal Oswal)

Technical View:

Nifty formed a bearish candle on the daily charts

Overall index has got stuck in a broader trading range of 10,700 to 10,985 zones and requires a decisive range breakout for next leg of rally, experts said.

Three levels to watch: 10811, 10944, 11000

Max Call OI: 11000, 10900

Max Put OI: 10500, 10800

Technical Recommendations:

We spoke to Bonanza Portfolio and here’s what they have to recommend:

Dishman Carbogen: Buy| LTP: Rs.219.25 | Target: Rs 240| Stop Loss: Rs.212| Return 9.50%

Tata Steel has announced its revolutionary vision for the UK housing market to meet the needs of the occupants with changing times by adopting a ""cradle-to-grave"" approach to design.

A white paper published on Monday in partnership with the Agile Ageing Alliance recommends a fundamental shift in the way housing development is considered in the UK.

Rather than a series of rungs the consumer must climb, from starter home upwards, and then back down again in later life, buildings would be capable of adaptation – of morphing to support a growing family, and then adjusting to accommodate an ageing one.

This vision of a home for life can only be achieved by looking at the needs of the occupant and how they change over time.

The report comes as the UK finds itself in a housing crisis.

According to the findings of a recent year-long cross-party housing commission launched following the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, England needs 3.1 million new social homes by 2040.

Henrik Adam, Chief Commercial Officer of Tata Steel Europe, said: ""In construction, housing is seen as a very challenging area. We believe there is an urgent need for a new approach to home owning throughout our lives. The basis of this starts in designing a home where a person can live, work and play throughout their lives.

""Well-designed spaces coupled with tailored systems are the starting point of a cradle-to-grave approach to housing design.

In a possible tweak to its strategy, Tata Steel may retain up to 30 percent of its shareholding in its South East Asian units, which had been put on the block.

Sources told Moneycontrol that the slight tweak means that Tata Steel is now looking for a partner and not a downright buyer.

The units include the Singapore-based NatSteel Holdings and Tata Steel (Thailand).

Earlier this week, media reports said the steel major was in talks with China's Hesteel Group. The Chinese company is the second largest steelmaker in the country.

In response to a query on the development, Tata Steel said: “In pursuit of its long-term strategy to create sustainable value for its shareholders, Tata Steel periodically undertakes strategic assessment and review of its portfolio including overseas business.

""Tata Steel will continue to consider all strategic decisions including portfolio restructuring options in a responsible manner taking into account the interests of stakeholders including employees. However, as there is no firm proposal for consideration currently, the company has no further comment to make in this matter.”

The stake sale is part of Tata Steel's strategy under CEO and Managing Director TV Narendran to refocus its energy and resources into India. Even as it looks to dilute stake in its South East Asian units, Tata Steel has forged a joint venture with thyssenkrupp for its European operations.

Now it wants to possibly follow the JV model in South East Asia too.

SuitorsThe acquisition of the two units had marked Tata Steel's first steps in going global.

It acquired NatSteel in 2004 for about 480 million Singapore dollars. A year later, the Indian major picked up Millennium Steel for $400 million, which included debts of $225 million.

The two units, which will be sold together, have seen interest from multiple players, including private equity companies.

Sources had earlier told Moneycontrol that the two units could be valued at $500 million. ""Couple of private equity players have shown interest,"" an executive had said.

But here too, Tata Steel now prefers a steelmaker to come over and pick up its stake in NatSteel and Tata Steel (Thailand). The two units have a combined steel capacity to make two million tonne a year.",380,

Tata Steel is in talks to exit its South East Asia (SEA) operations, which if successful could prove to be a huge step in correcting its faulty capital allocation, leading to several notable benefits.

Among several subsidiaries and businesses that Tata Steel operates globally, the SEA operation is the weakest. During the last reported quarter, it had earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) per tonne of Rs 1,736 as against Rs 4,886 in the case of European operation and much lower than the Indian operation’s EBIDTA per tonne of Rs 19,244.

While lower profitability and growth have been matters of concern, in terms of size too, it has little significance. In the current fiscal till December, the SEA operation, which includes several facilities in Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, produced mere 1.58 million tonne of steel as against total group steel production of 22 million tonne. Even the recently-acquired Bhushan Steel is twice the size in terms of the production and earns EBITDA per tonne of Rs 10,291, about six times higher compared to the SEA operation. This certainly suggests the exit would be earnings-accretive and rationalise the group’s focus.

The other important aspect of this exit would be unlocking of capital. The funds and assets, which are deployed in the South East Asia operation, can be used for more productive assets. In FY18, it generated an EBITDA of Rs 437 crore. Even at about 5-6 times enterprise value to EBITDA, SEA would be worth about Rs 2,200-2,600 crore. SEA contributes close to 8 percent to group sales and makes less than 2 percent contribution to group EBITDA. Exit as higher valuations would essentially mean better returns for the remaining operation.

Nifty Metal and auto index were the underperforming sectors, down close to 3 percent dragged by Hindalco Industries, JSPL, JSW Steel, Tata Steel, NALCO and Vedanta.

Nifty Metal was down almost 3 percent in this afternoon session dragged by JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Vedanta which dipped over 3 percent. The other losers included NALCO, Jindal Steel & Power and Hindalco Industries that shed 1-2 percent.

The S&P BSE Metal index was down 2.4 percent with losses from Vedanta, JSW Steel and Tata Steel being the top losers followed by Hindalco, JPSL, NALCO, SAIL, Hindustan Zinc and Coal India.

China’s factory activity contracted for the first time in 19 months in December as domestic and export orders continued to weaken, a private survey showed, pointing to a rocky start for the world’s second-largest economy in 2019.

The gloomy readings largely dovetailed with an official survey on December 31 that showed growing strains on China’s manufacturing sector, a key source of jobs. The findings reinforce views that the economy is losing more steam.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for December, released on January 2, fell to 49.7 from 50.2 in November, marking the first contraction since May 2017.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast only a marginal dip from November to 50.1, just above the neutral 50-mark dividing expansion from contraction on a monthly basis. China’s official PMI showed factory activity contracted for the first time in over two years, also pressured by weak demand at home and abroad.

Research firm CLSA is of the view that deteriorating Chinese demand outlook is likely to weigh on commodity prices. The house has cut FY20-21 EPS estimates by 9-38 percent factoring in lower commodity prices and a stronger rupee.

It has downgraded Tata Steel to ‘Sell’ from ‘Buy’ and has cut the price target to Rs 460 from Rs 855 and has also downgraded JSW Steel to ‘Sell’ from ‘Underperform’ and has cut the price target to Rs 260 from Rs 375.

From Hindalco, the research firm has downgraded the stock to ‘Sell’ from ‘Underperform’ and has cut the price target to Rs 210 from Rs 255 while it has maintained ‘Buy’ on Vedanta and has cut the price target to Rs 250 from Rs 300.",404,-0.9995546460151672

It is the second session of the new year and the benchmark indices are in a downtrend. The S&P BSE Sensex has slipped below its crucial support placed at 36,000 in intraday trade and ended below it.

The Nifty50 is not far behind. It has broken below Tuesday’s intraday low of 10,807 to hit a fresh low of 10,781 before regaining some strength on Wednesday. The index managed to close with losses of over a percent and below 10,800.

The S&P BSE Sensex saw a steep drop of over 500 points in intraday trade while Nifty50 saw a cut of 1 percent to trade below 10,800.

Technically, a close below 10,800 could put further pressure on the index, suggest experts.

“On the downside, index has support at 10,800-10,777 zones. Till it holds above 10,777 zones, overall bias could remain positive to range bound while a decisive move above 10,985 could start the fresh up move towards 11,176 levels,” Chandan Taparia, Associate Vice President, Analyst-Derivatives, Motilal Oswal Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

Here is a list of top five factors which could be weighing on D-Street:

Weak Asian Cues:

Overnight, US markets were closed while most of the Asian markets resumed trading on Wednesday after the New Year holiday. The cues were not supportive from the beginning of the session as most of the Asian markets were trading with a negative bias.

The Shanghai blue-chip index quickly shed 1.2 percent and South Korea fell 1.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei was closed for a holiday.

China Slowdown weigh on metal stocks:

The S&P BSE Metal index slipped more than 2 percent in the second half of the trading session weighed down by losses in Vedanta, JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Hindalco on concerns of a slowdown in China.

China’s factory activity contracted for the first time in 19 months in December as domestic and export orders continued to weaken, a private survey showed, pointing to a rocky start for the world’s second-largest economy in 2019, Reuters reported.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for December, released on Wednesday, fell to 49.7 from 50.2 in November, marking the first contraction since May 2017.

""Aluminium demand growth in 2019 is pegged at 2.5-3.5% YoY. However, weak Chinese demand in H2CY18 and further uncertainties expected in CY19 remain a cause of concern,"" Edelweiss Securities said in a report.

""Driven by an expected deficit of ~2mt (~3% of overall demand), we see limited downside for LME Al prices. If costs dip post Alunorte resuming full production and/or thermal coal prices receding, LME Al prices could come under pressure,"" it said.

CLSA has downgraded the metal sector which is also acting as an overhang for the sector. Deteriorating Chinese demand outlook is likely to weigh on commodity prices, it said.

The global investment bank slashed FY20-21 EPS estimates by 9-38 percent factoring in lower commodity prices and a stronger rupee.

Tata Steel: Downgraded to ‘Sell’ from ‘Buy’; cut price target to Rs 460 from Rs 855.

JSW Steel: Downgraded to ‘Sell’ from ‘Underperform’; cut the price target to Rs 260 from Rs 375.

Hindalco: Downgraded to ‘Sell’ from ‘Underperform’; cut price target to Rs 210 from Rs 255.

Vedanta: Maintained ‘Buy’; cut the price target to Rs 250 from Rs 300.Coal India: Maintained ‘Buy’; cut the price target to Rs 310 from Rs 360.

Auto stocks under pressure:

The S&P BSE Auto index slipped over 2 percent weighed down by losses in Eicher Motors, M&M, TVS Motor, Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp, as well as Ashok Leyland.

For Eicher Motors, December 2018 dispatches decline steeply by 13 percent on a YoY basis to 58,278 units. The numbers are below our estimates of 65,000 units and also sharply below market expectations.

Ashok Leyland December 2018 sales at 15,493 units have declined 20 percent YoY and are broadly in-line with our estimates of 15,950 units.

Hero MotoCorp December 2018 sales stood at 453,985 units, down 4 percent YoY and marginally below our estimates of 465,000 units. Increased competitive pressures and high channel inventory due to a weak festive season sales lead to the decline.

Indian manufacturing growth slows:

Indian manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace in December as growth in new orders and output waned, despite factories cutting their prices, a private survey showed on Wednesday.

The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, compiled by IHS Markit, declined to 53.2 in December, below November’s 54.0 reading and a Reuter's poll median of 53.6.

December saw the weakest increase in input costs for nearly three years, giving factories room to cut their prices for the first time since July 2017, Reuters reported.

GST collections drop for December:

Revenue collection from Goods and Services Tax (GST) fell to Rs 94,726 crore in December from Rs 97,637 crore a month ago, as per data released by the Finance Ministry on January 1.

Out of the total collection, Central GST (CGST) was Rs 16,442 crore, with states garnering Rs 22,459 crore State GST (SGST). At least Rs 7,888 crore was received as cess, with Rs 47,936 crore collected as Integrated GST (IGST), which is levied on the inter-state supply of goods and services and is divided between states and the Centre.

The government has set a target of over Rs 12 lakh crore for the financial year 2018-19, which can be achieved if the average monthly mop up is around Rs 1 lakh crore, as compared with Rs 89,885 crore in 2017-18.",916,-0.7636968553066253

The metals and mining sector this year was underlined by the consolidation wave brought in by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. And the wave, as we write, is not over yet with two of the biggest insolvency cases - ArcelorMittal and Bhushan Power and Steel - still being fought out in courts.

Here are some of the major events witnessed in the sector:

ArcelorMittal's so-near, yet-so-far situation

The world's largest steelmaker finally seemed to have cracked the fastest growing steel market. Well, nearly. ArcelorMittal's pursuit of Essar Steel has had twists and turns galore. It started with the company selling stake in Uttam Galva Steel to clear the Clause 29A hurdle. But that was not enough, and the company shelled out Rs 8,000 crore just to be eligible to bid. It could yet lose the race to... no, not Numetal, the consortium led by Russian bank VTB, but to the Ruias themselves, who have now offered to pay more than ArcelorMittal. However, banks are not buying the move as yet. The story may eventually find its end in 2019. And we are just saying 'may'.

Tata Steel Europe - Thyssenkrupp JV

It is no secret that the acquisition of Corus hasn't turned out as expected for Tata Steel. The steelmaker has been struggling to turn it around, or find a more definitive solution to the woes plaguing operations in Europe. It may have finally found one in the JV with Thyssenkrupp, the German behemoth. The JV will free up TV Narendran's hands and resources as he focuses on the company's India story.

Hindalco buys Aleris

Hindalco Industries' experience with inorganic expansion with Novelis couldn't be more different from that of Tata Steel's with Corus. And now to cement Novelis' dominant position in the value added space, the Aditya Birla Group acquired Aleris, a US-based company that dominates the building and construction space.

JSW Steel or Tata Steel, who is number one?

For much of 2018, JSW Steel and Tata Steel played the cat and mouse game to emerge on top of the Indian steel sector. As of now, JSW is slightly ahead following the Monnet Ispat acquisition that took the Jindal company's capacity to 19.6 million tons, a million ton more than that of Tata. But the race for Bhushan Power and Steel can change all that.

Vedanta enters the steel sector

Although Anil Agarwal has talked about Vedanta Resources' entry in the steel industry, the group's presence was limited to its iron ore interests. That changed with the acquisition of Electrosteel Steels, and Agarwal made an entry into the sector. But not everyone is convinced that the billionaire businessman would be a long term investor in steel. The answer may be in what he does with Electrosteel.

Events to look forward to in 2019

Steel cycle and the China factor

After enjoying high prices for over a year, the steel cycle may have turned in the last two months of 2018 as prices declined by 20 percent. While most of the industry executives expect prices to recover, given that the liquidity condition in the domestic market has improved, the critical factor will be China. Steel demand in China, the world's largest steel maker, has contracted, although production hasn't matched the trend as yet. The last quarter of the financial year would be crucial to see where the prices are headed.

Insolvency cases of Essar Steel and Bhushan Power & Steel

Both the races, especially that of Essar Steel, have been marked by lengthy court battles. Hopefully, we are now in the home stretch. The court orders will come in the New Year, and that would end the two auctions. Right now ArcelorMittal has its nose ahead in Essar Steel, and JSW Steel in Bhushan Power & Steel.

Mining bans

In March 2018, mining came to a halt in Goa, the country's largest exporter of low grade iron ore. In Karnataka, an issue over premium charges by the state government, saw NMDC suspending mining in the Donimalai mine, crucial for supplying ore to steelmakers in the region. In both the cases, industry players - miners and steelmakers - will be hoping that the bans are lifted in 2019.

Trade wars

With the Trump administration in the US imposing import duties, the risk of dumping has spooked the Indian metals sector. The softening of steel prices and a possible oversupply in China, has made steel players in India wary of dumping products in the domestic market.",755,-0.8704489171504974

The proposed joint venture between Tata Steel and thyssenkrupp will be led by Andreas Goss, who is currently CEO of the latter's steel division.

He will become the future Chief Executive Officer of the planned joint venture, which will be called thyssenkrupp Tata Steel BV, and chair the Management Board.

Tata Steel and thyssenkrupp AG had signed definitive agreements in June this year, to combine their European steel businesses in a 50/50 joint venture. The venture will be headquartered in Amsterdam.

Hans Fischer, the current CEO of Tata Steel Europe, will be the Deputy CEO & Chief Technology Officer of the new company. Sandip Biswas, who is currently the Group Executive Vice President, Finance, Tata Steel Limited, is the designated Chief Financial Officer, the Indian steelmaker said in a statement.

Premal Desai currently the Chief Financial Officer of thyssenkrupp Steel Europe will be the Chief Strategy Officer of the JV.

The JV is being currently probed by the European Commission, which wants to check if the proposed venture will hurt competition in the industry.

""The Management Board and the future top leadership team will be responsible for the planning and execution of the post-merger integration and the long-term business strategy once the planned Joint Venture has received the necessary regulatory approvals and after closing,"" said Tata Steel.

Despite Urjit Patel’s exit and setback for BJP in election results of three Hindi heartland states, Nifty5o closed in the green at 10,549.15 on Tuesday. But, the index has wiped out almost all the gains it made through the year. On December 29, 2017, the index had closed at 10,530.

During the same period, many NSE stocks fell 20-60% from their 52-week highs. As many as 22 Nifty stocks are a part of that list, which includes Tata Motors, Yes Bank, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Vedanta, Sun Pharma, IOC, Tata Steel and JSW Steel.

The loss of power in three states — Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chattisgarh — by BJP is a major event for investors to take note. Most experts feel that the journey from here on could turn volatile and the upside is likely to remain capped at 11,000 for Nifty.

Apart from political setback which could impact markets in the short term, the bigger worry will come from the global factors. In the US markets, more than half of S&P components are in a bear phase and most global investment banking firms are penciling a slower growth which could trigger a risk-off sentiment.

Foreign investors turned net sellers in December after pumping more than Rs 10,000 crore in Indian markets in November. A slow global growth environment will hurt growth for India Inc. as well which might not auger well for D-Street.

“Given, the present scenario where global economic growth is tapering, concerns on geo-political issues are on the rise, uncertain US trade policies, currency and crude oil volatility, inclusive corporate earnings growth trajectory yet to pick up; we expect 2019 to be no different from 2018, where markets may gyrate to extreme ends,” Dharmesh Kant, Head – Retail Research, IndiaNivesh Securities told Moneycontrol.

“Empirical evidence advocates bottom up approach for stock picking, which is the need of the hour. Companies that are driven by solid business models, asset-light balance sheet, high return ratios, and consistent earnings are the ones that would ride the storm,” he said.

Where investors should bet their money?

Investors will be better off not to touch high beta names until some clarity emerges with respect to General Elections 2019. But, till that time capital goods, IT, banking, agro are certain sectors which could hog the limelight.

""The Corporate banking space looks interesting, going ahead. The NPA cycle seems to have peaked out, the asset resolution bodes well, capex-cycle is slowly gathering pace, and the base for next year is very favourable. Apart from this, Pharmaceuticals and certain consumer-related stocks should do well,"" Prasanna Pathak, Fund Manager-Equity at Taurus Asset Management Co. Ltd. told Moneycontrol.

Kant feels that consumption space will outperform others, specifically FMCG, white goods, electrical & electronics, agro-chemicals, and select financials.

Sahil Kapoor, Chief Market Strategist, Edelweiss Investment Research, is of the view that pharma stocks could make a comeback in 2019 as current factors have led to extensive price damage.

Now that the state election results are pretty much clear, the focus has now shifted to the General Elections 2019. As per the trends, BJP's failure to get a clear majority in all three Hindi heartland states — Chattisgarh, MP, and Rajasthan — will bring the government back to the drawing board.

So what should investors do now? For market, the ride till general elections in April-May 2019 is likely to remain volatile. Most experts feel that gains are likely to remain capped at 11,000 on the Nifty, on the higher side, but the dips will give investors a good buying opportunity.

Largecap and quality midcaps are a better bet at current levels. In terms of sectors, investors can look at banking, insurance, AMC companies, IT and retail-oriented stocks.

“This now indeed makes central elections more speculative. Mostly, BJP will have to ally with other parties to form govt at the Centre,” Pritam Deuskar, Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio told Moneycontrol.

“If we look at history, the Vajpayee government didn’t come to power in 2004. The market for one-two days reacted negatively but post that we saw biggest bull run till 2008 and when the government came back again in 2009, markets reacted positively for two days, but post that markets remained flat for a long period,” he said.

Deuskar further added that we should simply ignore reactions for some days or short period and focus on what's coming and current good quality companies whose growth is most viable.

In the very short term, the market has largely discounted the outcome. Hence, further carnage is ruled out. The broader range for the market could be 9,700-11,000.

“A corollary would be that there would be stock-specific movements which one needs to catch. For investors, we feel, levels around 9,700-9,500 would be the levels to accumulate fundamental stories (not just fundamental figures &/or ratios) that, too, in a staggered manner. Sometimes, looking at the screen & doing nothing, is an art,” Pushkaraj Sham Kanitkar, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital told Moneycontrol.

Here is a list of top 10 stocks to buy now which could give 18-50% return in the next 1 year:

HCL Technologies: Buy | Target: Rs 1,330| Return 38%

Elara Capital maintains a buy rating on HCL Technologies with a target price of Rs 1,330. The company's acquisition of seven products from the US-based IBM has been met with such skepticism that market cap erosion was about 56 percent of the USD 1.8 billion that HCL has agreed to pay towards the deal.

The brokerage firm reiterates IP acquisitions would improve differentiation in large outsourcing deals and management commentary concurred in 1QFY19. Elara Capital believes that the market has ignored HCL’s potential to broaden its client base significantly.

Zydus Wellness: Buy| Target: Rs 1,472| Return 18%

Sharekhan maintains a buy rating on Zydus Wellness with a target price of Rs 1,472. Prudent fundraising plans, through a mix of debt and equity, reduce the risk of significant earnings dilution in the coming years.

The acquisition will enhance the overall product portfolio of Zydus and will make it a formidable player in the health and wellness space.

Further, the stock price of Zydus has corrected by about 10 percent since the announcement of acquisition due to non-availability of funding details of the acquisition.

Hence, the domestic brokerage firm upgraded its rating on the stock from hold to buy with a revised price target of Rs 1,472 (rolling it over to FY2021 earnings, valuing at 28x).

Apollo Tyre: Buy| Target: Rs 285| Return 26%

SMC Global Securities maintains a buy rating on Apollo Tyres with a target price of Rs 285. Apollo Tyres is one of the leading tyre manufacturing companies in India with products exported to over 100 countries.

The consistent focus on manufacturing excellence and quality has helped Apollo bag new OEM contracts and carve a niche for itself in the aftermarket.

The robust volume growth from OEMs, continued decline in Chinese imports & increased brand investments across categories and mediums augurs well for the company’s growth prospects.

It is expected that the stock will see a price target of Rs 285 in 8 to a 10-month time frame on a target P/E of 13.6 and FY20 EPS of Rs. 20.98.

Automotive Axles: Buy| Target: Rs 1,791| Return 35%

SMC Global Securities marinated buy rating on the company with a target of Rs 1,791. Automotive Axles is a joint venture between the Kalyani group and Meritor.

Sale of higher tonnage commercial vehicles is expected to increase on the back of healthy ramp-up in infrastructure projects. Further, the implementation of BS-VI norms is also expected to trigger a significant pre-buying of commercial vehicles.

These are expected to support the business prospects of the company going forward. The management is confident of a sustainable future for the organization owing to a strong team and robust processes.

It is expected that the stock will see a price target of Rs 1,791 in 8 to a 10-month time frame on a target P/E of 22 and FY20 EPS of Rs. 81.42.

Tata Steel: Buy| Target: Rs 720| Return 40%

Edelweiss Securities maintained its buy rating on Tata Steel with a target price of Rs 720. The European Commission (EC) has “stopped the clock” in its in-depth investigation (Phase-II) on the proposed joint venture (JV) between Tata Steel’s (TSL) European operations and ThyssenKrupp’s (TK) Steel Europe division pending certain details from both parties.

We believe this is not a cause for concern as: 1) such procedures are commonplace in big transactions like the one in question, and 2) both parties are expected to provide the required documents in “a few days”.

While we do not rule out additional pressure on the TSL stock until the investigation resumes, at this stage we do not believe the deal deadline would be missed materially. Maintain ‘BUY’ on TSL with an unchanged target of Rs 720.

Dishman Carbogen Amcis: Buy| Target: Rs 355| Return 50%

HDFC Securities maintained its buy rating on Dishman Carbogen Amcis (DCAL) with a target of Rs 355. With an increasing pressure on innovators to cut costs, the global CRAMS market is growing at a healthy double-digit rate.

The domestic brokerage firm believes that DCAL is steadily carving out a reputation as a reliable partner for innovators. With 17-18 products in phase III, the flow of lucrative commercial launches is likely to continue.

HDFC Securities expect this to not only drive further growth and profitability but also reduce dependence on single blockbusters (like Niraparib), leading to lower earnings risk.

La Opala RG: Buy| Target: Rs 299| Return 34%

Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities initiated coverage on La Opala with a buy rating and a target of Rs 299. La Opala RG (LORL) ventured into the opalware segment in the late 1980s, while its competitors entered this space only a few quarters ago.

Just by sheer experience, the brokerage firm feels that it can be reasonably sure that LORL has a far better understanding of product manufacturing, channel-partners’ demands and consumers’ expectations. In fact, it views the entry of new players as a positive signal for the industry and its future growth prospects.

With the buoyant and favourable consumer sentiment, Nirmal Bang expects LORL to increase its revenues and EBITDA at 13.2% and 14.2% CAGR over FY18-FY21E. Our growth rate estimate is lower than the Bloomberg consensus estimate and presents our base case scenario.

LORL’s stock is already down 40% from its recent highs and offers a good entry point for medium/long-term investors.

Dewan Housing Finance: Buy| Target: Rs 300| Return 49%

Angel Broking maintained its buy rating on Dewan Housing Finance post Q2 results with a target price of Rs 300. Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL) posted steady operating performance yet again in 2QFY18, however, liquidity issues began at the end of the quarter.

DHFL’s business grew in the quarter with a 35 percent YoY rise in loan book to Rs 1,10,100 crore. The current liquidity issue would completely reset midterm growth path and return ratios.

The brokerage firm expects the loan book to slow down significantly over FY18‐20, driven by the rising cost of funds. Considering, the above parameters, we have moderated our loan growth expectations for the company from 30 percent to 5 percent for FY2019E.

Zee Entertainment: Buy| Target: Rs 627| Return 31%

Nomura maintained its buy rating on Zee Entertainment with a target price of Rs 627. The management on the sidelines of the India Corporate Day held in Hong Kong indicated there are considerable opportunities in digital in the Indian market and that this can be capitalised with the right partner, hence its stake sale intent announcement to attract a strategic buyer.

The management maintains its target of 30 percent of revenues from the digital segment in five years. In traditional business, advertisement and subscription growth remain healthy. There were also queries on high pledging (60% of promoter shareholding).

They also mentioned that Essel Group is in various stages of discussion on the liquidation of the power transmission and solar assets, and it is working on the liquidation of the road assets. If these materialise, it should bring down most of the pledging.

Motherson Sumi Systems: Buy| Target: Rs 197| Return 28%

Nomura maintained its buy rating on Motherson with a target price of Rs 197. The management on the sidelines of the India Corporate Day held in Hong Kong indicated that organic growth will depend on car industry growth and there could be some fluctuations in the short term.

However, the focus of the company will remain on improving the bottom line across its businesses. On inorganic opportunities, valuations of recent transactions are still unreasonable and are reminiscent of the 2004-06 period, when customers were paying prices that were too high. Management will do acquisitions if it sees 40 percent ROCE being generated.

After hitting the peak of Rs 610, Tata Steel slipped lower till Rs 500. From this price, chances of developing of demand is higher and has been trading in a range bound zone of Rs 500 and Rs 520.

Currently, the stock is trading near its multi-support horizontal line and point of polarity on weekly chart is giving cues to accumulate this stock at lower levels.

Positive divergence in RSI on daily chart and declining histogram in MACD suggest upside momentum. As long as it sustains above Rs 480, possibility of moving on upside is higher and it can hit our first target of Rs 570. We recommend buying Tata Steel at Rs 509 with stop loss of Rs 479 for target of Rs 570.

After opening higher near 100-DMA (10,950) last week, Nifty slipped lower and traded below 200-DMA (10,750); however, state election results due on Tuesday will be important for charting market direction in the near term.

Although Nifty has been making lower highs and lower lows on the daily chart from last five days signaling bears having an upper hand, the benchmark index is still trading above crucial support levels.

Nifty is trading in a broadening rising wedge pattern on daily time frame; lower trend line of the wedge comes around 10,578 and upper trend line is near 11,055. It remains near-term trading range for the market.

Weekly RSI oscillator is also trading around 50 marks almost from last two weeks and flat Bollinger Bands suggest consolidations in this range too. Derivative open interest data also suggests a similar range.

However as the market is awaiting series of events to unfold like state election results, US Fed policy and UK parliament vote on modalities of Brexit would remain susceptible to major swings based on the news.

Bank Nifty

Banking index is trading above all short-term moving averages, 200-DMA (26,034), 50-DMA (25,600) and 20-DMA (26,300) indicate bullish bias. The short-term and mid-term trend is positive and immediate resistance is around 27,200 and support around 26,100.

Bank Nifty has a clearer long bias on the chart than Nifty, so trader looking for a long opportunity should prefer Bank Nifty.

Here are the top stock trading ideas which can give good returns:

Tata Steel: Buy around: Rs 509 | Target: Rs 570 | Stop loss: Rs 479 | Upside: 12 percent

Positive divergence in RSI on daily chart and declining histogram in MACD suggest upside momentum. As long as it sustains above Rs 480, possibility of moving on upside is higher and it can hit our first target of Rs 570. We recommend buying Tata Steel at Rs 509 with stop loss of Rs 479 for target of Rs 570.

Vedanta: Buy above Rs 198 | Target: Rs 221 | Stop loss: Rs 189 | Upside: 12 percent

Daily chart of Vedanta reveals that demand is increasing and supply is diminishing. Rising trend line from lower levels is displaying trend reversal and creates buying opportunity at current juncture.

Positive crossover in MACD signals optimism, suggest upside move in the counter in coming sessions. We suggest buying Vedanta above Rs 198 with stop loss of Rs 189 for target of Rs 221.

Wipro: Buy around: Rs 325 | Target: Rs 355 | Stop loss: Rs 309 | Upside: 9 percent

Wipro has been moving in a strong bull trend since long. It has given trend line breakout on daily chart which suggests a strong momentum on up side. Currently, it is moving above all its important moving averages.

Buy Infosys around Rs 689 with the stop loss of Rs 655 for the target of Rs 725.

MRF : Buy around Rs 65,575 | Target: Rs 69,000 | Stop loss: Rs 64,444 | Upside: 5 percent

MRF after giving a decent fall, seems to be trading above channel resistance line. Consistent formation of bull candle near its support line givies a hope to bulls for making long position in the scrip.

Currently, the stock is retesting its double bottom neckline which is giving opportunity to create long position in the scrip. Weekly chart is showing parity with its historical levels. Bullish crossover in MACD is also lending support its price action. One can go long around Rs 65,575 with the stop loss of Rs 64,444 for target of Rs 69,000.

Germany's Thyssenkrupp and India's Tata Steel are close to deciding who will lead their planned European steel joint venture, four people familiar with the matter said on December 7.

Settling on the venture's leadership has been delayed by a strategy crisis and change of CEO at the German industrial conglomerate, which has said it would split into two companies.

The holdup has riled the Thyssenkrupp workforce. A labour leader on December 5 said there would be ""trouble"" if the matter was not resolved soon.

Andreas Goss, head of Thyssenkrupp's steel unit, is the front runner to become chief executive of the combined entity, which will be Europe's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal, the people said.

The new company will have around 48,000 workers and about 17 billion euros ($19.4 billion) in sales, with production facilities in Germany, the Netherlands and Britain.

Goss, seen as well connected in the industry, has led Thyssenkrupp's steel division since 2014. The unit's adjusted operating profit rose by 26 percent to 687 million euros over the past financial year.

His appointment would further strengthen Thyssenkrupp's position in the 50-50 venture, which already includes a greater share of proceeds should the entity be listed on the stock exchange, which is widely expected.

Signed in June, the planned entity still needs European antitrust approval, which is expected towards the end of the first quarter of 2019. The groups might have to divest assets to secure approval, sources have previously said.

Hans Fischer, chief executive of Tata Steel's European subsidiary, is also likely to join the venture's management board, the people said, adding it was unclear how many seats the board would have.

Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel in June said the joint venture's management board would consist of six members, shared equally between both groups.

That number could be reduced to four to give a more focused structure to the entity, which will be called Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, the people said.

A decision will be announced very soon, the people said. Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff said last month a decision on the joint venture's leadership would be made before Christmas.

""The joint venture would have a two-tier management structure comprising a management board and a supervisory board,"" a Tata Steel spokesman said.

""Both boards would have equal representation from Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel,"" he said, adding further announcements will be made ""in due course"".

SAIL, Tata Steel and JSW Steel corrected 1-5 percent on Friday after global investment firm Citi downgraded these stocks and cut price target.

The research firm said steel prices should normalise in 2019 as demand in world's second largest economy China will slow down to negative 0.4 percent next year against 3 percent growth in current calendar year.

Effective supply will likely increase & hot-rolled coil steel margin could be under pressure, Citi feels.

It said falling steel prices, rising leverage and valuations made Indian steel companies unattractive.

Hence, the brokerage house decided to downgrade Tata Steel & SAIL to sell from neutral & JSW Steel to sell from buy.

It also slashed price target sharply for JSW Steel cut to Rs 290 from Rs 410 earlier, Tata Steel to Rs 440 from Rs 620 and SAIL to Rs 40 from Rs 72.

Thyssenkrupp needs to quickly settle who will lead a planned European joint venture with Tata Steel, a labour leader said on December 5.

Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff said last month that a decision on the leadership of the joint venture would be made before Christmas.

""If not then we'll make trouble,"" Tekin Nasikkol, who heads the works council of Thyssenkrupp's steel unit, told reporters.

""There is a lot to talk about, but we don't have anyone to talk to,"" Nasikkol said. ""I have to strongly condemn this.""

With worst of the asset quality concerns behind us in the banking space, pick up in industrial activity as well as robust consumer sentiment, we expect Nifty earnings to stage an impressive CAGR of 18.5 percent over FY18-20E to arrive at a target of 12,100, Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICIDirect.com, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Q. What is the sense you are getting from markets?

A. The underlying macroeconomic growth coupled with corporate earnings growth momentum is likely to be a key catalyst for the market movement.

We note pick-up in industrial activity coupled with robust consumer demand both at the urban as well as the rural front remains the silver lining.

The resilient corporate earnings growth across most of the pockets is another positive. However, it is likely to be a volatile ride wherein we need to keep an eye on global tariff war news flows, crude volatility coupled with domestic macroeconomic factors, and election outcome.

Q. How did India Inc. perform in September quarter?

A. The Q2FY19 results were encouraging with nearly 20+ percent growth in the topline while margin compression amidst high commodity price led to muted bottomline growth.

Therefore, while the earnings have certainly picked up after near flat spell over FY14-18, the pace of growth is not too exciting. The earnings downgrade in Q2FY19 was largely contributed by the banking and auto space.

We, however, are of the opinion that we are nearing the end of earnings downward cycle. We expect Nifty earnings to stage an impressive CAGR of 18.5 percent over FY18-20E.

Q. Do you feel that FIIs are back in Indian markets?

A. With the sharp decline in crude prices (almost 30 percent in seven weeks), a key macro headwind for India has been addressed and the same is reflected in Indian rupee (appreciating over 4.6 percent in November, which is the strongest recovery in Asian FX).

With crude price outlook fading on excess supply concerns and the US Fed adopting a slightly dovish tone, strong EM stories have started to make comeback.

India is stacked well in the current set up and FIIs are likely to renew their focus on Indian Capital markets.

India continues to offer one of the highest positive real rates (accretive bond inflows) and equity markets have also cooled off over 10 percent from its record high in Jan 2018 and looking more compelling based on the forward growth projections.

Q. What are your views on the recently concluded board meeting of RBI and the government?

A. RBI and government in the board meeting finally concluded that an expert committee is needed to arrive at a consistent framework for RBI reserves requirement and thereby the transfer possible.

It indicates RBI is not rigid on transfer but needs the same to be decided by experts. Considering that the talks about the resignation of governor did not materialize, markets took it positively.

CCB buffer extension by one year was a marginal relaxation versus the demand to cut Basel III to align with international standards. Hence, it was largely a non-event.

Q. What are your expectations from the upcoming RBI policy meet in December?

A. RBI, in its policy meet in December is not expected to touch repo rate and a status-quo can be expected. The two most important variables after inflation are crude and currency that have now corrected from their peaks which provides the breather.

Therefore, unless core inflation sees a material upsurge, the upcoming monetary policy can be seen as a non-event.

Q. Given sudden appreciation in rupee, do you it is time to re-look at IT and pharma?

A. In the IT Space, as the demand remains healthy, it is mixed with caution due to talent supply crunch (leading to increase in localisation and subcontracting cost), rising employee costs in wake of high attrition and rupee appreciation.

Hence, we remain cautiously optimistic about the IT Sector. We believe companies that have adopted higher localisation have a strong deal pipeline and valuation comfort will do well.

Similarly, on the pharma space, we remain positive on pockets which have posted upbeat Q2 earnings and are still below their fair valuations after the earnings upgrade.

Q. Do you think largecaps offer still a better bet compared to mid & small-caps?

A. We continue to like broader market over the largecaps. We also note the market is witnessing a strong divide in valuations across quality and ordinary businesses notwithstanding market capitalisation which warrants that investors should be stock specific now.

Emphasis should always be on buying a business that are run in a capital efficient way and possess sustainable growth prospects.

Q) What are the sectors according to you are recommending to your clients and why?

A. Among the sectors, we are positive on pharma (stabilised US, strong growth in India, improved margins), corporate banks (peaked out NPA cycle, asset resolution), IT (strong deal pipeline and valuation comfort) and capital goods (strong order inflows, improved working capital cycle).

Corporate banks remains one of the preferred sector to look forward to as the NPA cycle has peaked, while asset resolution also bodes well. We expect sharp earnings recovery, next year, on a benign base.

Q. What is your target for Nifty for the FY19?

A. Going forward, with worst of the asset quality concerns behind us in the banking space, surge in industrial activity as well as robust consumer sentiment, we expect Nifty earnings to stage an impressive CAGR of 18.5 percent over FY18-20E. We assign a P/E multiple of 19.0x to FY20E Nifty EPS of Rs 636 to arrive at a Nifty target of 12,100.

Q. Any top five stocks which you consider are a good buy at current levels after the recent fall from highs for a holding period of 1-2 years?

A. Our stock picks after Q2FY19 earnings are:

Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail Ltd:

ABFRL has delivered a superior performance in profitability terms for H1FY19, with EBITDA margins expanding 200 bps YoY and PAT coming in at Rs 48.3 crore versus net loss of Rs 30 crore in H1FY18.

We anticipate H2FY19 will perform better, particularly Q3FY19 on account of a shift in major festivals. We expect revenue, EBITDA to grow at a CAGR of 14 percent, 24 percent, respectively, in FY18-20E.

Tata Steel:

We like Tata Steel for its integrated operations (100 percent iron ore and ~30-35 percent coking coal), which aids in clocking higher EBITDA/tonne vis-à-vis its domestic peers even in increased input cost scenario.

State Bank of India:

Given improving industry credit growth and a possible shift of business from NBFCs, SBI is best placed to ride the opportunity. We expect credit offtake to surge to 11 percent CAGR in FY19-20E.

The bank is also poised to benefit from the faster resolution of NCLT accounts. Pick-up in growth and focus on maintaining credit cost will result in sharp improvement in its earnings trajectory.

Indian Hotels:

The company plans to add 20 new hotels through management contracts that will further boost the topline, going forward. In addition, cost rationalisation and RevPAR growth are expected to drive margins in FY18-20E. Hence, we have a positive view on the stock.

L&T:

Given strong backlog, front-loading of order inflows, improving balance sheet quality (CFO generation), the company is well placed to deliver a 14.2 percent and 20 percent revenue and PAT CAGR in FY18-FY20E, respectively.

While S&P BSE Sensex is down about 10 percent from the highs it hit in August, many small, mid and large-cap stocks have corrected way more than that in just a matter of months.

There are local and global triggers that led to the sudden fall in markets. On the macro front, the rise in crude oil prices as well as fall in rupee weighed on investor sentiment.

However, investors can use the opportunity to build their portfolio by buying into quality stocks with an investment horizon of 1-2 years, suggest experts.

The September quarter results were a mixed bag failed to lift investor sentiment. The upcoming results of state elections in December and general elections in 2019 will give enough entry points for investors as markets are likely to remain volatile, suggest experts.

“We have a preference for largecaps post the correction in valuations, with continued volatility and with important events (state elections) ahead, we see opportunities emerging in the mid-cap space also,” Gaurav Dua, Head of Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas told Moneycontrol.

“Improvement in the macro environment does have a positive impact on equities. Easing of crude oil prices, stability in rupee and its possible fallout on monetary policy has aided sentiment. Along with domestic macro factors, the sentiment in the Indian equity market has also been aided by the recent rally across emerging markets due to signs of peaking out of the continuous strengthening of the US Dollar,” he said.

On the sectoral front, Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICIdirect.com told Moneycontrol that he is positive on pharma (stabilised US, strong growth in India, improved margins), corporate banks (peaked out NPA cycle, asset resolution), IT (strong deal pipeline & valuation comfort) and capital goods (strong order inflows, improved working capital cycle).

Here is a list of top 10 stocks from different experts which are worth a buy for a holding period of 1-2 years:

Analyst: Vipin Khare, Director- Research, William O'Neil India

ICICI Lombard:

ICICI Lombard General Insurance is the country's leading private sector general insurance company with a market share of 16.8 percent in that space. Overall, it is the fourth-largest player and held a market share of 8.2 percent as of March.

Few regulatory factors such as increasing FDI limit to 49 percent from 26 percent and mandatory cover of third-party motor insurance to three years for four-wheelers and to five years for two-wheelers bodes well for the industry.

In addition, the Company is investing heavily in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation, and machine learning to remove human intervention in the distribution of products and service claims, which helped the Company increase its market share in travel insurance to 24.9 percent in FY 2018 from 20.8 percent in FY 2017.

In the engineering segment, it went up to 11.2 percent from 9.8 percent, while fire insurance rose to 8.5 percent from 7.5 percent. The marine insurance increased to 12.7 percent from 11.7 percent.

Divi’s Laboratories:

Divis Laboratories is a global manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates for generic drugs. The Company operates through four manufacturing facilities at two sites and earns nearly 87 percent of its revenue from exports.

The Company reported a strong set of numbers in Q2. Revenue from operations grew 44 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 12,850 crore, beating consensus.

The net profit (PAT) was at Rs 3,970 crore (+92% YoY), comfortably ahead of expectations. The strong results were driven by normalization of operations at the manufacturing sites after obtaining U.S. FDA clearance.

With increasing opportunities in its generic business following the supply disruption in China, the Company announced capex of Rs 1,200 crore for two Brownfield projects at its two manufacturing units.

Both the units will get an investment of Rs 600 crore each. An additional Rs 300 crore will be allotted to debottlenecking programs for capacity expansions of existing projects. The projects are expected to be completed by the end of 2019.

Vinati Organics:

Vinati Organics Ltd. is engaged in the manufacturing of organic and inorganic chemical compounds and speciality organic intermediaries such as isobutyl benzene (IBB), ATBS, and isobutyl benzene, among others.

In its Q2, earnings jumped 124 percent and revenues were up 57 percent on a YoY basis. The performance was aided by production expansion and improved EBITDA margins.

EBITDA margins were 37.7 percent for the quarter, as against 28.6 percent for the corresponding quarter in the previous year.

After the only other credible ATBS manufacturer announced its exit, the Company is at set to enjoy higher margins with the weaker bargaining power of buyers and almost no threat of new entrants.

This has translated into an elevated EBITDA margin of 37.7 percent compared with 28.6 percent in the same quarter the previous year and five-year average margin of 27.7 percent.

VIP Industries:

VIP Industries manufactures a wide range of hard and soft-sided luggage under brands such as VIP, Skybags, Alfa, Aristocrat, Carlton, and Caprese. In India's organized luggage market, the Company enjoys more than 50 percent share.

Growth in the aviation industry is an important factor that drives the luggage industry's performance. Domestic passenger traffic expanded at a CAGR of 13 percent during FY 2013-2017.

In June, India's domestic passenger traffic grew 18.4 percent YoY, while it rose 17.3 percent in 2017.

In addition, the introduction of GST and its reduction to 18 percent from 28 percent augurs well for organized luggage makers as it reduces the price gap between the organized and unorganized segments.

With a market share of more than 50 percent, VIP Industries is well-positioned to benefit from a level-playing field post-GST.

Havells India:

Havells India is involved in the manufacture of electrical and electronics durables in the consumer as well as industrial segments.

The top-line grew more than 20 percent for the seventh quarter in a row as a result of market share gains in fans, water heaters, and other small appliances, and first-mover advantage in the Internet of things (IoT) enabled devices.

In addition, strong innovation and continuous launches in different categories are expected to continue expanding its market share in fans, grooming appliances, and brown goods (iron, toasters, mixers, and grinders, etc.).

Analyst: Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICIdirect.com

Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail Ltd (ABFRL):

ABFRL has delivered a superior performance in profitability terms for H1FY19, with EBITDA margins expanding 200 bps YoY and PAT coming in at Rs. 48.3 crores compared to a net loss of Rs. 30 crores in H1FY18.

We anticipate H2FY19 will perform better, particularly Q3FY19 on account of a shift in major festivals. We expect revenue, EBITDA to grow at a CAGR of 14 percent, 24 percent, respectively, in FY18-20E.

Tata Steel:

We like Tata Steel for its integrated operations (100% iron ore and ~30-35% coking coal), which aids in clocking higher EBITDA/tonne vis-à-vis its domestic peers even in increased input cost scenario.

State Bank of India (SBI):

Given improving industry credit growth and a possible shift of business from NBFCs, SBI is best placed to ride the opportunity. We expect credit offtake to pick up to 11 percent CAGR in FY19-20E.

The bank is also poised to benefit from the faster resolution of NCLT accounts. The pick up in growth and focus on maintaining credit cost will result in sharp improvement in its earnings trajectory.

Indian Hotels:

The company plans to add 20 new hotels through management contracts that will further boost the topline, going forward. In addition, cost rationalisation and RevPAR growth are expected to drive margins in FY18-20E. Hence, we have a positive view on the stock.

Jitendra Kumar GuptaMoneycontrol Research

In a firm pricing environment, companies like Tata Steel, that have been building capacities through the organic and inorganic route have been big beneficiaries. This is precisely the reason that Tata Steel reported a very good set of numbers backed by strong performance delivered across businesses.

On a consolidated basis, during Q2FY19, the company reported a strong 34 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in sales to Rs 43,544 crore. This was largely on account of higher contribution from the subsidiaries. The domestic standalone business saw a marginal 2 percent growth in volumes to 3.2 million tonnes. However, on account of the better pricing environment, it benefitted because of the higher realisations.

During the quarter, India business realisations grew by 22.4 percent to Rs 55,282 per tonne. Moreover, the recently-acquired Bhushan Steel more than doubled its sales turnover to Rs 5862 crore during Q2FY19 as against Rs 2108 crore in Q1FY19. Bhushan Steel is ramping up its business with the focus on rationalising operations and inventories. Similarly, the South East Asian operations reported a strong 22 percent growth in sales.

Operating performance

Thanks to the operating efficiencies kicking in because of the high scale, the company gained in terms of operating margins. During the quarter, operating margins expanded by 600 basis points to 20.5 percent largely on account of lower cost and higher realisations.

To put in perspective, because of its captive resources during Q2FY19, the standalone business made an EBITDA per tonne of Rs 19,244 per tonne as against Rs 11,078 per tonne in the corresponding quarter last year. Besides, Bhushan delivered an EBITDA of close to Rs 1,175 crore as against an EBITDA of Rs 66 crore in Q1FY19.

While European business grew very marginally in terms of revenues, its contribution was higher at the operating levels led by higher contribution from the value-added products and cost savings. During the quarter, Europe made an EBITDA of Rs 4,886 a tonne as against Rs 2,816 a tonne in Q2FY18. The overall better operating performance also lifted profitability. During the quarter, the company reported an almost three-fold jump in net profit to Rs 3116 crore.

Valuation and outlook

The management expects prices to remain stable and more benefits coming because of the integration of Bhushan Steel. That apart, as the capex reaches its maturity, the company is now looking to use internal cash for deleveraging the balance sheet. However, it would be worth monitoring progress on the acquisition of Usha Martin and Bhushan Power. In terms of valuations, at 6.5 times FY20 estimated earnings stock is reasonably valued.

While we are positive on steel demand outlook especially in India, the risk of trade wars and increasing imports remains a concern,"" T V Narendran, CEO & Managing Director said in a statement.

Takeaways from the post-result media briefing

On EU commission investigation into Tata Steel Europe and thyssenkrupp JV, Narendran said they are in discussions with the European Commission for the phase two review which typically takes 90 days.

The Commission has identified three areas, including packaging steel and electrical steel, in which the JV could have a dominant position.

The company is already looking to divest its electrical steel portfolio, including assets in Canada and UK, said Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director, Tata Steel.

""This has been one of the best ever quarter for Tata Steel India on the back of strong operating and market performance with the EBITDA margin of 34 percent and in excess of Rs.19,000 per ton,” said Chatterjee.

It was the best ever EBITDA margin for the India operations, and the highest quarterly EBITDA in six years, he added.

On ArcelorMittal’s possible entry in India, Narendran said Indian industry will benefit from world-class players. From Tata Steel’s perspective, we will up the ante and compete.

""Couple of private equity players have shown interest,"" an executive said, but added the talks were at an early stage.

While NatSteel Holdings is based in Singapore, Tata Steel Thailand - which was earlier called Millennium Steel - is the largest steelmaker in the country.

""In pursuit of its long-term strategy to create sustainable value for its shareholders, Tata Steel periodically undertakes assessment and review of its portfolio including overseas business,"" a Tata Steel spokesperson said.

""Tata Steel will continue to consider all strategic decisions including portfolio restructuring options in a responsible manner taking into account the interests of stakeholders, including employees. However, as there is no firm proposal for consideration current, the company has no further comment to make in the matter,"" added the spokesperson.

View from the top

The country's largest steelmaker had first given a peek to its strategy in July, when during its AGM, Chairman N Chandrasekaran said that Tata Steel is looking to simplify its structure and may sell assets that have not scaled.

Interestingly, Tata Steel's global ambitions took first steps with the acquisition of NatSteel, in 2004 for about 480 million Singapore Dollars. A year later, the Indian major picked up Millennium Steel for $400 million, which included debts of $225 million.

Two years later, the global expansion would end with the record buy of Corus for $12 billion.

But the overseas expansion hasn't gone according to the plan. The Corus business, now Tata Steel Europe, is being merged with the steel business of thyssenKrupp, in an attempt to bring stability.

NatSteel and Tata Steel Thailand too haven't scaled up to expectation. While the operations in the region turned profitable in the last financial year, margins remained low. While net profit of Tata Steel Thailand doubled, that of NatSteel dived by more than half. EBITDA, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, of both the firms fell.

""The two companies haven't scaled despite attempts. The view is that resources should be concentrated in India, which is among the fast growing steel markets in the world,"" said a senior executive from the industry.

Push from Narendran

The plan to sell the two units have got a strong push from Tata Steel CEO and Managing Director TV Narendran.

The Tata Steel veteran was involved in the acquisition of NatSteel Singapore and took over as its President & CEO in 2008. From 2013, he was Managing Director of the operations, both in India and South East Asia. At present, he is the Chairman of the two units.

Narendran has been vocal about refocussing Tata Steel's resources to grow in India, where the company has aggressively bid for distressed assets. It has already bagged Bhushan Steel, and continues to be in the reckoning for Bhushan Power & Steel. It has also acquired Usha Martin.",541,0.568577359120051

The mjunction services limited, a B2B e-commerce company, has launched in association with the Tata Steel a working capital finance programme for the MSME sector for buying steel.

The programme christened 'URJA' will provide unsecured finance to buyers purchasing material from Tata Steels distributors, mjunction CEO Vinaya Varma told PTI. ""We'll be serving a category of MSMEs buying primary steel which accounts for Rs 1200 crore market.

The platform will allow an MSME to buy steel from a distributor without cash which was not possible in the traditional method,"" Varma said. ""The financing will not be done by the Tata Steel.

The platform has financers which will finance for the Tata Steel product bought,"" he said. The Tata Capital, the Hero FinCorp and Axis Bank are already on the platform and talks are on to bring the Aditya Birla Finance, mjunction officials said.

""This digitally enabled platform solution will connect emerging corporate accounts to potential lenders. I believe the initiative has the potential to set a new norm for steel consuming segments. We expect to touch over 600 customers through this initiative within a years time,"" Tata Steel chief of marketing & sales Sanjay Sahni said.

The mjunction officials said financing would be done to pre-approved consumers and distributors. The need surfaced after it was found MSMEs were seeking products in credit while the steel distributors were unable to meet their demand.

Tata Steel will adopt a unified branding strategy for all newly-acquired companies, a top official of the steel major said on November 5 .

The company has recently taken over stressed steel plants of Bhushan Steel and the steel business of Usha Martin. It is also vying for more assets referred to the NCLT.

""We will have unified branding of Tata Steel for all the companies, so as to not confuse consumers. However, it would be done only after they are upgraded to meet standards of Tata's quality,"" Tata Steel (India) President-Steel Business, Anand Sen told PTI.

Bhushan Steel's own brand will continue to be in place for now, he said.

Sources in Tata Steel had earlier said there are several areas that require upgrades in Bhushan Steel plants to meet the standards of the steel giant.

Tata Steel Ltd is eyeing an installed capacity of around 30 million tonne per annum by 2025 in India from the existing 18.5 million tonne, a senior company official said on Monday.

The steel major has recently taken over Bhushan Steel and Usha Martin plants, which has a combined rated capacity of 7 million tonne per annum.

""With expansion and new capacities, we expect that by 2025, we can have 30 million tonne capacity in India,"" Tata Steel (India) President-Steel Business, Anand Sen said here.

He was speaking about Tata Steel in context to the steel sector's performance and outlook, on the sidelines of a curtain raiser event for an upcoming Indian Institute of Metals' programme.

Sen said the planned 30-million-tonne capacity was based on the projected capacity of the Kalinganagar plant to 8 million tonne after its second phase of expansion, the Jamshedpur plant (13.5 million tonne) and the two recently-acquired steel companies.

The total capacity of the steel giant stands at 27 million tonne, taking into account its European operations.

Speaking about Bhushan Steel, Sen said in the current fiscal, it will achieve 4-4.2 million tonne production.

""We are still evaluating capex in the plant (Bhushan Steel), but estimate it may require about Rs 500-1,000 crore,"" he added.",222,

India Inc earnings for the September quarter have managed to just about meet Street expectations so far. Until October 29, most of the 28 Nifty companies that released their Q2FY19 results reported net profit and EBITDA either in-line or just above estimates.

The earnings season has been uneventful so far with headline numbers broadly meeting estimates and a few disappointments. Of the 28 companies, 18/23 have either met or exceeded our estimates on the PAT/EBITDA front, Motilal Oswal said in a note.

The broader narrative around earnings has not changed much with continued earnings downgrades, it said. For the MOSL Universe, sales, EBITDA and PAT grew 25.8%, 13.9% and 6.3% YoY, respectively, as against expectations of 23.6%, 14.1% and 9%, respectively.

Among the Nifty constituents, Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank, Ultratech Cement, BPCL, Bharti Airtel, HCL Tech and Reliance Industries have missed our PAT estimates, while ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance and Dr. Reddy’s have exceeded estimates, said MOSL.

The domestic brokerage firm slashed Nifty EPS estimates for FY19 by 2.1 percent to Rs 528 from Rs 539, primarily driven by Reliance Industries and Bharti Airtel. For FY20, Nifty EPS has been cut by 1.4 percent to Rs 665 from Rs 674.

“We are building in Nifty EPS growth of 16%/26% for FY19/20,” said the note.

Motilal Oswal highlights 10 sectoral highlights post Q2 results:

Information Technology

The seasonal strength of Q2 manifested across top-tier IT. The revenue performance was patchy across tier-II with Hexaware, Mindtree, and Persistent Systems missing expectations. An overall commentary, on-demand environment remains positive and is substantiated by another quarter of healthy deal wins.

Banks

Private Banks continued reporting steady trends in loan growth, though the margin performance has been mixed – ICICI Bank and RBL Bank reported an improvement, while Kotak Mahindra Bank and IndusInd Bank exhibited a modest decline.

Asset quality has been stable for retail banks, though worries remain on the exposure towards IL&FS Group (sizeable exposure with IndusInd Bank and YES Bank). ICICI Bank has reported surprisingly benign slippages, despite management change.

NBFC

Most NBFCs continue reporting strong numbers on the business front. All vehicle financiers have reported strong growth and stable-to-improving margins. HFCs have reported in-line numbers, but yields for smaller HFCs continue to be under pressure. Management commentary on liquidity has been divergent.

Autos

Results so far have been in line with expectations. Continued raw material cost pressure and currency volatility (MSIL) in 2QFY19 have been managed by price hikes and cost-control initiatives.

Even though OEMs see the impact of raw material inflation easing in 2HFY19 (except steel), the risk on margin remains due to currency volatility and higher discounting because of heightened competitive intensity.

Consumer

Results of consumer companies have been good so far with sector heavyweights HUL and ITC reporting in-line numbers and indicating an improving trend. Nestle reported an impressive set of numbers on all fronts.

While Asian Paints disappointed on margins, its volume growth was robust and ahead of expectations. Colgate’s results were also in line with low expectations. Given that these five stocks contribute nearly 70% of sectoral EBITDA and PAT, the results season on a weighted average basis is likely to be in line with expectations.

Oil & Gas

Only RIL and BPCL have reported numbers so far. Both have reported a sequential contraction in the refining margins. We expect pressure on the refining margin to continue in the third quarter as well.

Petrochemical margins have also contracted sequentially for RIL. We expect margins pressure to continue due to the impact of higher prices on demand, and also the start-up of two new ethane crackers in the US.

Telecom

Bharti witnessed a sluggish quarter, while Vodafone-Idea is also expected to deliver a muted performance. ARPU down trading (mainly in the postpaid category) and the burgeoning debt have been the key concerns.

We believe that (a) the shift of competition among top three players (v/s smaller players earlier) for higher subscriber market share and (b) Jio Phone’s healthy offtake would continue exerting pressure on incumbents’ performance.

Metals

Although steel prices dipped in July due to seasonal volatility in demand, average realization remained stable QoQ for JSW Steel. Margins, too, remained close to historical high as cost inflation was benign.

A similar stable margin trend is expected for Tata Steel and SAIL. Margins for steel companies have clearly peaked on the recent increase in coking coal prices and the INR depreciation.

Capital Goods

Results have been mixed so far, with BHEL’s operating performance coming in much below expectations (adverse revenue mix impacted the company’s margins profile), while Bharat Electronics delivering extremely strong results.

Pharma

Performance in the Pharma space has been mixed. US business continues witnessing pricing pressure (albeit the intensity is now lower). Domestic formulations business grew at a subdued rate due to a high base of the past year. Favorable currency movements led gains to some extent.

Disruption in China on account of pollution concerns is providing a window of opportunity to backward-integrated Indian companies. In particular, DIVI and ALPM have delivered a strong beat on earnings. DRRD and JLS’ results were largely in line. GLXO’s performance was below expectations.

Tata Steel Ltd said on Wednesday it will continue talks with the European Commission after the body raised concerns over its planned steel joint venture with Thyssenkrupp.

The European Commission (EC) on Tuesday opened a deeper investigation into the proposed steel joint venture over concerns that it could raise prices and harm competition.

Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel earlier this year unveiled plans to combine their steel activities in Germany, the Netherlands and Britain to become the continent's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal.

""Tata Steel has noted the EC's concerns and will continue its discussions with the EC including providing further information and analysis, especially in relation to sectors they have identified, to secure approval for the proposed joint venture,"" the company said in a statement.

The Commission on Tuesday pointed out three areas where the combination of both companies' specialty flat carbon steel and electrical steel products could give them a dominant position: steel for the automotive sector, metallic coated steel for packaging and grain-oriented electrical steel.

The European Commission has opened a deeper investigation into ThyssenKrupp's planned steel joint venture with Tata Steel over concerns that it could raise prices and harm competition.

The so-called Phase II investigation was widely expected and follows a similar probe into ArcelorMittal's takeover of Italy's Ilva, which was cleared only after the group pledged to sell assets.

ThyssenKrupp and Tata Steel earlier this year unveiled plans to combine their steel activities in Germany, the Netherlands and Britain to become the continent's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal.

""The Commission is concerned that, following the transaction, customers would face a reduced choice in suppliers, as well as higher prices,"" the EU executive said in a statement.

""These customers include various European companies, ranging from major corporations to numerous small and medium-sized enterprises,"" it added.

The Commission identified three areas where the combination of both companies' speciality flat carbon steel and electrical steel products could give them a dominant position: steel for the automotive sector, metallic coated steel for packaging and grain-oriented electrical steel.

Tata Steel's European unit has already put a number of assets on the block, including Cogent, a manufacturer and processor of electrical steels, and it is unclear whether these divestments would satisfy EU concerns.

The Commission now has 90 working days, until March 19, 2019, to investigate the matter and take a decision.

A spokeswoman for ThyssenKrupp said that the group would continue to work closely with the Commission, adding that the deepened probe was expected and standard for a transaction of this size.

The move is nonetheless fuelling expectations that the deal will require asset disposals to win approval.

Analysts expect few problems regarding crude steel production, where rating agency Moody's reckons the venture will control just 14 percent of the European market, a distant second to ArcelorMittal's 29 percent, which includes Ilva.

But the new company, to be named ThyssenKrupp Tata Steel, would have a share of about 50 percent of the European packaging steel, or tinplate, market, a person familiar with the industry told Reuters.

Rasselstein, Thyssenkrupp's packaging steel unit, posted sales of 1.16 billion euros ($1.32 billion) in the 2015/2016 fiscal year and employed about 2,400 workers.",373,-0.33317166566848755

Jitendra Kumar GuptaMoneycontrol Research

Tata Sponge, a Tata group company and the subsidiary of Tata Steel, is currently operating at over 110 percent capacity utilisation even though the company has cash and cash equivalent of close to Rs 670 crore, or about 68 percent of its net worth, to set up a new facility.

The company did plan to deploy this cash and last year expressed an intent for a forward integration by way of making steel. But the market did not take it enthusiastically as it came in a little late considering at least 3-4 years are needed to commission such plans, particularly during volatile commodity cycles.

While it partly missed capitalising on the up cycle in the steel industry, the move now to acquire Usha Martin’s value-added long products steel business could prove to be shot in the arm.

Value accretive

Usha Martin has an integrated operation for making 1 million tonne of specialised alloy-based long products supported by captive iron ore, coal and power plants. These assets will be acquired on a slump basis, which will cost around Rs 4,300-4,700 crore. This division of Usha Martin currently generates earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) of about Rs 350 crore. Based on this, the valuations of these assets works out to around 12-13 times EV/EBITDA.

However, a large part of the value lies in turning around its operation to its fullest capacity. For instance, this facility is generating an operating profit of Rs 5,500 per tonne, which is far lower than peers' at Rs 10,000-11,000 a tonne. Post-acquisition, the strategy would be to bridge this gap.

Currently, the division is operating at a capacity utilisation of about 71 percent. Conservatively assuming a capacity utilisation of about 90 percent with a corresponding 50 percent improvement in operating profits to about Rs 8,200 a tonne, it has the potential to generate EBITDA of close to Rs 750 crore. Taking that into account and the acquisition price, valuations works out to 5.7 to 6.2 times which is reasonable. Based on this, the pre-tax return on capital comes to about 16-17 percent.

Near-term dilution risk

The acquisition has its own cost considering the limitation of resources with Tata Sponge. Cash in the balance sheet (Rs 670 crore) can partly help but there will still be a need for capital. The company plans to take board approval for a rights issue up to Rs 1,800 crore, external borrowings up to Rs 2,500 crore and issue of non-convertible redeemable preference share up to Rs 1,000 crore.

After the acquisition, the balance sheet size of the company will be about Rs 5,000 crore (net of cash). Even at a debt-to-equity ratio of 1:1, the company will require to raise additional equity. A rights issue of Rs 1,500 crore (rest through preference shares), would dilute equity by 55 percent. However, that should not be a cause for worry as the combined entity would have an enterprise value of about Rs 5,200 crore, which is about 5 times their expected EBITDA over the next two years. Moreover, over the next two years, this would ensure growth and improve return ratios of Tata Sponge, which is struggling to deploy its excess cash.

Prashant Jhawar, former chairman of Usha Martin, who had earlier disapproved the sale of steel business to Tata Steel, will back the resolution in the upcoming shareholders' meeting slated for the next month. Basant Kumar Jhawar and his son Prashant own 25.5 per cent stake in steel wire maker Usha Martin.

""We had earlier welcomed the possible involvement of the Tatas in the management of Usha Martin's steel division resulting in value for all stakeholders.

""In order to facilitate this, we have instructed our lawyers to support the resolution for the sale of the steel division of Usha Martin to the Tata Sponge Iron Ltd (TSIL), at the forthcoming shareholders meeting,"" Prashant Jhawar said in a statement.

The shareholders' meeting is scheduled for November 10.

According to sources: ""This does not indicate any settlement within the family. The support to the deal is only an acknowledgement of TSIL's ability to run the steel business"".

Concerns on the current management of the Usha Martin remain, the sources added.

According to them, the Basant-Prashant Jhawar promoter faction of Usha Martin had not given their approval to Tata Steel's offer for acquiring the company's steel business at the meeting of board of directors held last month and had sought details on the utilisation of funds.

""We have also conveyed our decision to the lead banker, the State Bank of India. We are doing this even though our concerns over specific utilisation of sales proceeds towards repayment of term loan, working capital, unsecured /operating creditors and more particularly the contingent liabilities in the residual business as listed on page 65 of the annual report of UML for year ending 31 st March 2018, remain unaddressed,"" Jhawar further said in the statement.

The total contingent liabilities listed stand around Rs 860 crore, including claims from the Jharkhand government pertaining to irregularities in the mining operations, allegedly carried out by the present management, he said.

""We believe, should such claims require settlement it may result in additional debt being loaded on to the residual business. It would be in the best interest of all stakeholders, if the management and the board come out with specific plans to find a resolution.

""Our concern on the above as well as possible diversion of funds remains unaddressed. As stated earlier, we are pleased to extend a warm welcome to the reputed house of Tatas to run the steel division founded by my father, Basant Kumar Jhawar,"" he said.

Jhawar also exuded confidence that TSIL will run the assets in the way they deserve to be administered and enhance the legacy.

""Basant Kumar Jhawar has always worked in the interest of all stakeholders and this event is not an exception, thereby supporting the resolution and acquisition of assets,"" he added.

Tata Steel Thursday indicated that it was unlikely to raise its Rs 17,000-crore bid for debt-ridden Bhushan Power and Steel.

Around 90 percent of lenders of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL) has voted in favour of JSW Steel's bid of more than Rs 19,000 crore, sources told PTI last week.

When asked if Tata Steel was still keen on Bhushan Power and Steel, company MD T V Narendran said, ""At the price we have bid.""

Tata Steel reportedly has objected to lenders of BPSL finalising a bid of its rival JSW Steel.

""What we have said is that process has been compromised. It is not about who bid. Because earlier when we went to NCLAT we felt that Liberty Steel had bid after the last date which we felt was a compromise of the process. JSW has also bid after the last date so that's our only point that the process has been compromised. There is nothing against any of our peers,"" Narendran explained.

""So, our agony is that the process has been compromised and court will decide based on it immediately,"" he added.

Tata Steel last month submitted before the NCLAT that lenders of BPSL permitted rival JSW Steel to change basic parameters of bids after submission.

JSW Steel had revised its offer from Rs 11,000 crore to little over Rs 19,000 crore.

Bhushan Power and Steel was among the 12 non-performing accounts referred by the RBI for NCLT proceedings.

When asked will there be any competition threat with the world's largest steel maker ArcelorMittal planning to enter Indian steel market, ""That's fine. I think we encourage good competition. We compete ArcelorMittal in Europe, so we can compete with them in India as well. I think we are confident in our own equity with our customers.""

Narendran further said that the company expects to complete the Usha Martin deal within next six months.

Tata Steel said its subsidiary Tata Sponge Iron will acquire the steel business of Usha Martin Ltd (UML) for Rs 4,300-4,700 crore.

With the acquisition, Tata Sponge Iron Limited (TSIL) will enter the steel business.

Meanwhile, TSIL in a regulatory filing said it has been evaluating various strategic options beyond the manufacturing of sponge iron, to enhance its product portfolio and ""has identified an entry into steel manufacturing in long products as a route to ensure sustainable long-term value creation for all its stakeholders"".

Last month, the Tata Group company had announced the execution of definitive agreements for the acquisition of the steel business of UML through a slump sale on a going concern basis.

On the cost of acquisition, TSIL said: ""It is proposed that the steel business of UML will be acquired subject to transaction closing, for a cash consideration of between Rs 4,300-4,700 crore (subject to various transaction adjustments)"".

Earlier in May, Bamnipal Steel Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Steel, had acquired a controlling stake of 72.65 percent in Bhushan Steel Ltd (BSL). Tata Steel had won the bid to acquire debt-laden BSL in an insolvency auction.

""...we hereby inform you that, Tata Sponge Iron...will now carry out the Acquisition. Consequently, definitive agreements signed between Tata Steel and UML in relation to the Acquisition shall be adapted accordingly,"" Tata Steel said in a regulatory filing.

The closing of the acquisition remains subject to execution of definitive agreements between Tata Sponge and UML and fulfilment of various conditions, including regulatory approvals required for the transfer of the steel business.

Earlier, UML had said the sale of steel business to Tata Steel will help the company in ""significant reduction"" of its debt. The deal is expected to be completed in 6-9 months, it added.

UML's steel business comprises the specialised 1 mtpa alloy based manufacturing capacity in long products segment based in Jamshedpur, a producing iron-ore mine, a coal mine under development and captive power plants.

Tata Steel Group is among the top global steel companies with an annual crude steel capacity of 27.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) as on March 31, 2018.

Usha Martin is amongst the largest wire rope manufacturers in the world and a leading speciality steel producer in India.

Tata Steel further said that long products comprise an important part of the overall market for steel and demand for them in India, is expected to grow significantly in the future, especially in value-added customer segments like construction, automotive and engineering.

Tata Sponge has a debt-free capital structure and free cash reserves of around Rs 670 crore and it is therefore ideally placed to enter steel manufacturing with a focus on the attractive speciality long products portfolio, the company said.

""Considering the alignment in the views of Tata Steel and Tata Sponge with regard to the latter's strategy of focusing on long products, Tata Steel as the promoter shareholder of Tata Sponge, has agreed to support Tata Sponge's strategy and has identified it as the strategic vehicle to undertake the acquisition of the steel business of UML,"" said Tata Steel.

The Board of TSIL has adopted a financing plan for the acquisition where along with its internal cash and cash equivalent resources it would raise financing by way of a combination or part of rights issuance (up to Rs 1,800 crore), external borrowings (up to Rs 2,500 crore), and issuance of non-convertible redeemable preference shares (up to Rs 1,000 crore)

Tata Steel further said it has noted the financing plan and confirmed its support, in-principle to the overall financing structure.

Once Tata Sponge finalises the specifics of the above plan and approaches Tata Steel for investment support as may be necessary, the same will be considered by the Board of Tata Steel at the appropriate time, the release added.",645,0.9114589393138885

JSW Steel may have emerged as the favourite to bag Bhushan Power & Steel, but the script may change yet again, as it has often happened in this race for the Delhi-based stressed company.

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) is slated to hear Tata Steel's petition on October 22. The Tata company had challenged National Company Law Tribunal's (NCLT) April order that had allowed Liberty House to submit its bid, post the deadline.

JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Liberty House are the three contenders for Bhushan Power & Steel. The stressed company's lenders had over two days - Monday and Tuesday - voted on JSW Steel's offer, which eventually received over 90 percent of the votes.

The hearingHearing at the Appellate Tribunal could again bring a new twist to the auction if it uphelds Tata Steel's argument. This will also have a bearing on JSW Steel's bid.

The Sajjan Jindal-company had revised its bid in August, just before the lenders were to vote on Tata Steel's bid. JSW Steel bid Rs 19,700 crore, trumping the Rs 17,000-crore bid of Tata Steel. The revised bid was much higher than JSW Steel's first offer of Rs 11,000 crore.

While Liberty House has bid Rs 17,500 crore, lenders had asked for details on its financing, raising doubts on the offer from the London-based Group.

VotingJSW Steel's bid may have received 90 percent of the lenders' vote, but it doesn't stop Tata Steel and Liberty House revising their bids.

But that too will depend on the outcome of the October 22 hearing.

""They would first want to wait for what the Tribunal says before taking the next step,"" an executive from the industry said.

At the same time, legal experts said the Committee of Creditors (CoC), consisting of the lenders, will have the last say on the matter. ""After the Essar Steel case, it is clear that all the power now lies in the hands of CoC,"" a senior counsel said.

The Supreme Court had asked Numetal and ArcelorMittal to clear dues to become eligible to bid for Essar Steel. This was against the order of the NCLAT, which had deemed Numetal's bid as eligible.

The CoC will now have to see to it that Numetal and ArcelorMittal clear the dues within the stipulated time of two weeks, and go ahead with the process.

If the NCLAT toes the line taken by Supreme Court - and thus reaffirming CoC's power to take decisions - it will clear the way for JSW Steel to bag Bhushan Power & Steel.",443,

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Steel

In our recent interaction with TATA Steel ’s (TATA) Investor Relations Team , they reemphasized on their plans to expand market share in India with 1) B rownfield expansion of Kalinganagar operations, 2) acquisition of Usha Martin’s (UML) steel operations in Jamshedpur and 3) increase in utilization of recently acquired Bhushan Ste el (BSL). Management is confident of significant improvement in margins of acquired assets with the rationalization of input prices and increase in realizations to bring them on par with TATA . Firm outlook on steel prices, reduction of exposure to Europe an markets (through JV with ThyssenKrupp) and sweating of acquired assets increases our conviction (TP of Rs780). Newsflow on Bhushan Power and Steel (BPSL) acquisition can remain an overhang in the near term.

Outlook

However, we believe that recently concluded acquisition of UML would reduce TATA’s aggressiveness for BPSL’s acquisition. Maintain BUY.

The buyout of distressed steel assets in India could significantly raise the leverage of the acquiring firms, Fitch Ratings said Thursday.

""The acquisitions of distressed Indian steel assets could significantly increase the leverage of the acquiring companies, which also face the risk of domestic output being displaced by a substantial increase in imports from the escalation of trade barriers,"" Fitch Ratings said in a new report.

Steel firms Tata Steel Ltd (TSL) and JSW Steel Ltd acquired steel assets that were under insolvency proceedings, seeing them as an opportunity to gain capacity cheaply and quickly in a fast-expanding market compared with executing green-field projects, it said.

""We believe acquisitions could increase TSL's leverage and that even though JSW has taken a more conservative approach in terms of transaction structure, a shift from its focus on maintaining investment discipline may also weaken its credit profile,"" it said.

Fitch also believes that solid domestic demand has created space to accommodate some increase in imports, but domestic output could be displaced if imports pick up substantially, possibly due to escalation of trade barriers, it said.",229,-0.19990042448043824

Centrum's research report on Tata Steel

We see Usha Martin (UML) steel business acquisition as a smart move given the attractive discount of 30% to greenfield cost for a well-integrated asset providing product diversification and synergy benefits. We see that Net Debt/EBITDA for consolidated operations including both Bhushan (BSL) and UML (excl. European business which is getting shifted to JV) is likely to remain in a comfortable zone of 3.1x in FY20E (vs 2.9x at FY18 end) led by strong cash flows of domestic business given the favorable steel cycle and low cost metrics. We expect TSL to abandon any further inorganic acquisition efforts in medium term given its five year goal of doubling capacity in India is well within reach now.

Outlook

Upgrade to Buy with a SOTP based TP of Rs 800 as we expect both Bhushan steel and Usha Martin acquisitions to be value accretive in medium term.

After acquiring debt-laden Bhushan Steel through the insolvency and bankruptcy process, Tata Steel is now aiming to raise its production to 4 million tonne (MT) by the end of the current fiscal, an official said.

Bhushan Steel's Odisha plant is presently operating at 3.5 MT against a capacity of 5 MT, the official said.

""The Bhushan plant in Odisha has a capacity of 5 MT but is currently operating at 3.5 MT. We are working to raise the production at least to a level of 4 MT a year by March 2019 as demand remains robust,"" the official, who is part of the new team installed by Tata Steel in the company, told PTI.

The Bhushan Steel plant is located close to Tata Steel's Kalinganagar facility where it has a 3 MT capacity.

The official said the Kalinganagar plant expansion is on track despite Bhushan's takeover at Rs 36,000 crore.

""Safety and environment aspects need to be strengthened in Bhushan Steel as they are not up to our (Tata Steel's) internal standards,"" he said.

The new plant will follow Tata Steel's strategy of not just being a steel producer but a service company with extensive use of technology.

Though Bhushan Steel will continue to be operated as a standalone outfit for the time being, a change of name is imminent to make it resemble a Tata company. The new management will be leveraging and complementing marketing strengths of Tata Steel, the official said.

Tata Steel had earlier said there was a lot of synergies in taking over Bhushan Steel.

Tata Steel took almost a decade to build 3 MT plant at Kalinganagar while the takeover of Bhushan Steel offered the steel major a readily available 5 MT plant, boosting its flat products.",309,0.8637847900390625

The pressing need to resolve stressed assets in the steel industry has opened up an opportunity for bigger players with balance sheet strength.

Tata Steel, which recently concluded the acquisition of Bhushan Steel, is acquiring Usha Martin’s steel assets. While it is a relatively smaller-sized buy -- one million tonne capacity compared to 5 million tonnes in the case of Bhushan Steel, it could be value accretive given the valuation and synergies that Tata Steel will enjoy with this acquisition.

Moreover, given the size of the acquisition, its impact on the financial leverage of Tata Steel would be negligible. Rather we would await the result of the ongoing acquisition process of Bhushan Power, which if acquired would have a much larger impact on financial leverage of Tata Steel.

Synergies of the deal

Usha Martin’s steel assets which are valued at around Rs 4,300-4,700 crore has an integrated operation with the rolling mills and captive iron ore mines.

Usha Martin’s problems started with its expansion and diversification, which led to pressure on the balance sheet as cash flow from these new businesses was not enough to service its debt.

While the overall industry slowdown was responsible, it also impacted its core profit-making steel business which enjoyed unique advantages such as the manufacturing of value-added products.

Interestingly, Usha Martin’s steel division earned earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation (EBITDA) of Rs 5,500 per tonne in FY18, far lower than the EBITDA commanded by peers in the region of about Rs 10,000-11,000 a tonne.

During the peak of the cycle, these assets reported EBITDA of about Rs 500 crore against a current run rate of about Rs 340 crore. Thus, it is quite obvious that with the acquisition, Tata Steel would use its brand (Tata Tiscon in long products) and drive other operating efficiencies possibly through higher capacity utilisation, at about 71 percent currently, to increase profitability.

An attractive asset

Even at 90 percent capacity utilisation and assuming a 50 percent improvement in current EBITDA per tonne to about Rs 8,250 per tonne over the next two years, it can potentially generate operating profits of about Rs 740 crore. Based on the potential operating profits, valuations work out to about 5.8-6.3 times on the basis of enterprise value to operating profits, which is quite reasonable. Pre-tax return on capital works out to close to 16-17 percent on a constant basis. Moreover, valuation should also be looked at from the fact that these are operational assets. Creating similar assets would have definitely cost more today and could possibly take 3-4 years to build.

Tata Steel is likely to put in Rs 300-400 crore in FY20 into Usha Martin's specialty steel division that it has agreed to acquire, to further improve the operating margins, a report said.

In one of the largest debt resolution case outside the NCLT, the Usha Martin (USL) board had on September 22 signed an agreement with Tata Steel (TSL) to sell the Kolkata-based firm's steel and wire rope business for a cash consideration of up to Rs 4,300-4,700 crore in a slump sale.

USL's Jamshedpur-based steel division has one million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of alloy-based manufacturing capacity in the long products segment.

""TSL will help in improving the blended EBITDA/tonne (operating margins per tonne) of the acquired business to Rs 8,000 per tonne by FY21, from the current Rs 6,800 per tonne on the back of captive coal supplies, optimisation of sales mix and other operational synergies,"" India Ratings said in a report.

It expects the acquired division to contribute a modest 3.5 percent to TSL's absolute EBITDA in FY20 for domestic business.

The rating agency also assumes TSL to incur an additional Rs 300-400 crore of capex in FY20 to further improve the division's EBITDA/tonne.

The agency expects total cash outflows on account of capital expenditure and acquisitions to remain below Rs 9,000 crore in FY19, with a large portion of the acquisition outflows to occur only in FY20.

India Ratings said that the acquisition is credit neutral for TSL, adding that proposed acquisition will lead to a modest increase in TSL's net leverage to about 4.0x in FY20, against 3.3x in FY18.

It can be noted that global rating agencies S&P and Moody's on September 25 had said the purchase is credit positive for TSL as it widens its product portfolio to the high margin long products segments, where the Tatas are not strong now, without impacting the company's financial profile or leverage as the deal will be an all-cash one.

India Ratings also said the proposed acquisition appears to be a good strategic fit to TSL, aligning well with its existing location and vicinity of captive iron ore mines. The iron ore and coal mines are adjacent to TSL's existing projects, located primarily in eastern India.

It will increase TSL's India capacity to 19.3 mtpa, from 18.3 mtpa, making it the largest steel company by domestic production.

It expects revenue contribution from TSL's long product division to increase to about 22 percent by FY20, compared with 18 percent in FY18, of the domestic sales in the near-to-medium term.",435,0.9997811402593341

""The board and management of Usha Martin (UML) are fully committed to the objective of selling its steel business to repay its debts. The board has stipulated that the sale proceeds from transaction will be first used towards discharging the liabilities to lenders.

""The concerns highlighted by Basant Jhawar and Prashant Jhawar regarding any diversion of funds received from Tata Steel towards purchase consideration for acquisition of steel division of UML are refuted as such concerns are unfounded,"" Usha Martin said in a statement.

The company also said that it is clarified that UML will use the entire consideration (net of transaction costs and taxes, if any received from this sale to discharge liabilities to lenders.

The proposed acquisition of Usha Martin's steel business by Tata Steel is credit positive, Moody's Investors Service said.

The domestic steel giant had announced on September 22 that it has executed definitive agreements to acquire steel business of Usha Martin.

""The proposed acquisition is credit positive for Tata Steel because it will help the company to strengthen its overall business and expand its presence in eastern India. The deal will have no immediate ratings effect,"" Moody's Investors Service said in a statement.

Usha Martin's steel business comprises a one million tonne per annum (MTPA) steel manufacturing capacity at Jamshedpur, an operating iron ore mine, a coal mine under development and captive power plants.

The transaction remains subject to various regulatory approvals and is likely to close over the next six to nine months.

The acquisition of Usha Martin's steel business, once completed, will strengthen Tata Steel's business profile because it will help Tata Steel to further solidify its geographical footprint in eastern India with its current manufacturing plants located in the same region as Usha Martin's facility, the statement said.

In addition, the acquisition will also help Tata Steel to further widen its long products offering and increase the proportion of value-added goods in its product mix.

Moreover, the captive raw material sourcing at Usha Martin's steel operations will supplement Tata Steel's existing business, which is also vertically integrated, thus alleviating any concerns about the sourcing as it continues to expand its production capacity both organically and inorganically.

Moody's further said that it ""expects strong demand fundamentals in India and lack of incremental new capacity to result in market share gains for Tata Steel. Tata Steel's announcement to acquire Usha Martin's steel business, which will subsequently be rebranded under the Tata Group, will help the company to increase its domestic shipments, thereby enabling it to capture a larger share of the domestic demand and increase its domestic market share"".

Steel demand in India is likely to remain robust and continue to grow in mid-single digit supported by strong consumption in the infrastructure, automobile and capital goods segment, it added.",359,0.9538867218153817

Tata Steel's acquisition of Usha Martin's speciality steel business will improve the share of long steel products in its business at no additional leverage, says a report.

Tata Steel, which has a capacity of 27.5 million tonne, has a disproportionate skew towards flat steel products now while Usha Martin has an integrated steel-making business with predominantly long steel products which get better margins.

In one of the largest debt resolution plans outside the NCLT process, the Usha Martin board had signed an agreement with Tata Steel on September 22 to sell the Kolkata-based company's steel and wire rope business for a cash consideration of up to Rs 4,300-4,700 crore in a slump sale.

Usha Martin, which had a debt of over Rs 3,700 crore and a revenue of Rs 3,441 crore in the last fiscal year, had informed the exchanges that the sale would bring down the debt significantly. SBI is the lead banker for the group's debt.

""At the proposed transaction value of Rs 4,300-4,700 crore, we do not expect the acquisition to have a material negative impact on Tata Steel's financial profile or leverage. We expect the company to pay in cash for the acquisition, which is through a slump sale. The acquisition will also improve its product portfolio,"" S&P said in a note Tuesday.

Given the robust prices and strong volume outlook for the domestic steel market, S&P expects ""Tata Steel to continue with its strategy of bidding for bankrupt steel assets as it strives to maintain leadership in a high growth market.""

Last Saturday, Tata Steel had said it had agreed to snap up the Usha Martin said they fund use from slump sale But Monday, the promoters Basant and Prashant Jhawar, sought transparency on fund utilisation from the board of the company saying as of now there is no clarity on who'll get how much from the sale proceeds.

""Though we are encouraged by the Tatas signing an agreement with the current management of Usha Martin, the end use of the funds is opaque,"" Usha Martin founder Basant Jhawar and his son Prashant, who together own 25 per cent stake in the company, said in a statement Monday.

The deal is expected to be completed over the next two-three quarters.

Usha Martin's steel business comprises the specialised one-million tonne alloy-based manufacturing capacity in long products segment in Jamshedpur, a producing iron-ore mine, a coal mine under development and captive power plants.

Within days of selling their speciality steel business to the Tatas, the promoters of Usha Martin, Basant and Prashant Jhawar, sought transparency from the Tatas on fund utilisation saying as of now there is no clarity on who'll get how much from the sale proceeds.

In one of the largest debt resolution plans outside the NCLT process, the Usha Martin board had signed an agreement with Tata Steel to acquire the Kolkata-based steel and wire rope-maker for a cash consideration up to Rs 4,300- 4,700 crore.

Usha Martin, which had a debt of over Rs 3,700 crore and a revenue of Rs 3,441 crore in the last fiscal year, had informed the exchanges that the sale would bring down the debt significantly. SBI is the lead banker for the group's debt.

The slump sale is a milestone in the six-decade history of the Kolkata-based company and one of the few instances of promoters deleveraging through asset sale.

""Though we are encouraged by the Tatas signing an agreement with the current management of Usha Martin, the end use of the funds is opaque,"" Usha Martin founder Basant Jhawar and his son Prashant, who together own 25 percent stake in the company, said in a statement Monday.

But the Jhawars were quick to add that the Tatas' involvement in their steel business will add value to the stakeholders and that the transaction with Tata Steel is overall a positive development.

The company is fighting a takeover and management control battle at the NCLT now.

""As 25 percent shareholders, we are concerned about the liabilities which will fall on the residual business and its capacity to service the same. No details are available.

""How much of the term loans, working capital, liabilities to unsecured creditors and other liabilities will be cleared and how much will be carried forward with the burden falling on residual business is very opaque.

""This has created doubts over the transparency and the management accountability. Since no details are on the table, our concern over diversion of funds continues,"" they said and sought ""complete transparency in fund utilisation"" and have sought further details from the board.

The deal is expected to be completed over the next two-three quarters.

""It is proposed that the steel business of Usha Martin will be acquired subject to transaction closing, for a cash consideration of Rs 4,300-4,700 crore subject to various transaction adjustments,"" Tata Steel had said in a statement.

Usha Martin's steel business comprises the specialised one-million tonne alloy-based manufacturing capacity in long products segment in Jamshedpur, a producing iron-ore mine, a coal mine under development and captive power plants.

Tata Steel is among the top global steel companies with an annual crude steel capacity of 27.5 million tonne as of March.

Usha Martin is amongst the top five wire rope manufacturers in the world and a leading speciality steel producer in the country.

In May, Bamnipal Steel, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Steel, completed the acquisition of controlling stake of 72.65 percent in Bhushan Steel, for a consideration of Rs 35,200 crore, though the insolvency auction process.

India Ratings and Research said it has affirmed Tata Steel's long-term issuer rating at 'IND AA' with stable outlook.

Instruments with 'IND AA' rating are considered to have high degree of safety regarding timely servicing of financial obligations and such instruments carry very low credit risk, according to the India Ratings and Research.

""India Ratings and Research has affirmed Tata Steel Ltd's long-term issuer rating at IND AA, while resolving the Rating Watch Evolving (RWE). The Outlook is Stable. Ind-Ra had placed the ratings on RWE on April 11, 2016,"" it said in a statement.

The RWE resolution follows clarity on the overall impact on TSL's credit profile post-acquisition of Bhushan Steel Ltd (BSL) and carving out of its European operations, it said.

In June, Tata Steel had agreed to the terms of a 50-50 joint venture with Germany's Thyssenkrupp to create Europe's second-largest steel company after Lakshmi Mittal's ArcelorMittal.

IND-Ra said the integration of BSL operations and carving out of the European operations will substantially improve the company's business profile with a stronger per tonne EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).

Besides, the agency expects acquisition of BSL will aid TSL in further expanding its footprint in eastern India, strengthening customer segments across automotive, appliance, tubes, general engineering and fabrication; and maintaining steady proportion of downstream products.",232,0.9997954368591309

Indian markets consolidated in a range of 300 points last week. It hit a low of 11,393 on September 5, but managed to recoup losses and closed 0.78 percent lower at 11,589.10 for the week ended September 7.

Rising crude oil prices, fall in rupee, escalating concerns over trade wars as well as rising India bond yields weighed on sentiment. The rupee touched a fresh record low of Rs 72.​10​/USD in the week gone by.

It looked like most traders made peace with the rupee at 71, but the moment this level was crossed and the currency touched Rs 72/USD, it caused some panic in the traders’ fraternity. Weakness in the rupee and global cues will lead to some bit of volatility in the coming week as well.

“For coming weeks, we expect markets to be volatile and remain sideways with Sensex moving in range of 37,700-38,950 and with respect to Nifty, the range could be 11,300-11,750,” Prateek Jain, Director, Hem Securities told Moneycontrol.

“In terms of currency, we expect the rupee to weaken further with USD/INR touching the level of Rs 72.75/USD in the coming days,” he said.

Technically speaking, Nifty made a ‘Bullish Hammer’ pattern in the midst of the last week and it has shown some significance because we saw a similar pattern getting formed for two more sessions.

But, the first half of the forthcoming week would be quite crucial in order to draw the immediate route map for the market. The index will have to convincingly traverse the strong resistance zone of 11640 – 11700, if it has to gain some real strength in the near term, suggest experts.

“The index has to cross and hold above 11640 – 11700 levels if it has to gain some real strength in the near term. It looks possible considering the broader market participation; but as a trader, one needs to be closely tracking how index behaves around those important levels,” Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst, Technicals, and Derivatives at Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.

“On the lower side, 11484 followed by 11436 would now be seen as immediate and crucial supports. At this juncture, a strategy would be to focus on individual pockets that are providing better trading opportunities,” he said.

Here is a list of top 10 money making ideas from different experts which could give 4-11% return in the next one month:

Analyst: Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst, Technicals, and Derivatives at Angel Broking

RBL Bank Ltd: Buy| LTP: Rs 609.30| Target: Rs 642| Stop Loss: Rs 587| Return 5%

This has been clearly one of the top outperforming stocks within the midcap private banking space. Recently, this stock managed to clock new highs despite some of its peers lying around their 52-week low.

The higher degree time frame charts are extremely strong and hence, recent correction in the stock can be interpreted as a profit booking move.

In the course of action, the stock prices managed to find support around its previous breakout points and eventually attracted a strong buying interest which hints towards a possibility of resuming its larger degree uptrend.

Hence, traders can look to go long on the stock for a target of Rs.642 in coming days while a stop loss can be fixed at Rs.587.

Tata Motors Ltd: Buy| LTP: Rs 277.50| Target: Rs 394| Stop Loss: Rs 269| Return 42%

The stock outperformed the broader index during the last week and it is likely to continue to do so in the coming trading sessions as well.

The stock is trading above its 21/200-DEMA on the daily charts, indicating a positive momentum in the counter in the short-term. The 14-day RSI line has already given a positive crossover with the 9-day signal line and is pointing northwards, reaffirming our bullish stance in the stock in the near-term.

Hence, we recommend Smart Traders to initiate a Long position around the current levels with a stop loss placed below 946 for the target of 1014 levels.

Tata Steel submitted before the NCLAT that the lenders of the debt ridden firm Bhushan Power & Steel permitted rival JSW Steel to change the basic parameters of its bids after submission.

Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing on behalf of Tata Steel, submitted before the appellate tribunal that it was against the interim order passed by NCLAT on August 6.

While, Tata Steel following NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal) order of the appellate tribunal August 6 order, has filed one additional plan.

Passing an order on August 6 order, the NCLAT had allowed all three contenders -- Tata Steel, Liberty House and JSW - to file additional unconditional 'resolution plans' by August 13, 2018, improving their financial offer without compromising the basic parameters of the 'resolution plans' already submitted by them.

However, the Committee of Creditors allowed JSW to change basic parameters of its resolution plans.

A two-member NCLAT bench headed by Chairperson Justice S J Mukhopadhaya has listed the matter on September 24 for next hearing.

In July, NCLAT had vacated its stay and asked the CoC to consider resolution plans submitted by three firms -- Tata Steel, Liberty House and JSW Steel. The tribunal on July 20 gave a go-ahead to the CoC meeting, directing it to finalise a bid for the company.

However, JSW Steel revised its offer from Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 18,000 crore ahead of the CoC meeting.

Tata Steel put in a bid of Rs 17,000 crore.

Bhushan Power and Steel owes about Rs 45,000 crore to its lenders.

Earlier on July 17, the NCLAT had stayed the meeting of CoC when they were going to vote for finalisation of the highest bidder (H1) for BPSL.

Tata Steel on Thursday announced a ""ground-breaking"" new sustainable technology which could save half the amount of carbon dioxide released during steelmaking following tests at its Ijmuiden site in the Netherlands.

Its HIsarna technology for producing iron consists of a reactor in which iron ore is injected at the top. The ore is liquefied in a high-temperature cyclone and drips to the bottom of the reactor where powder coal is injected.

This significantly reduces the number of energy-intensive steps required for the traditional steelmaking process, the Indian steel major said.

""HIsarna's results show we can make a significant contribution to improving the sustainability of steel production with this Tata Steel technology,” said Hans Fischer, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Tata Steel's European operations.

""The development of this technology forges our ambition to become a steel company which is sustainable in all respects,"" he said.

The company said that testing has shown this technology can lead to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions from the steel production process. During the final test campaign, experiments were done with the use of steel scrap and biomass. This revealed it was possible to achieve a CO2 reduction of more than 50 percent.

Tata Steel's HIsarna plant has now become a permanent part of the production chain at the IJmuiden site, with molten iron joining that from the blast furnaces in the steelmaking process.

Meanwhile, the design of an industrial scale HIsarna plant capable of making up to 20 times more liquid iron has started. It could be put into operation in seven years, Tata said.

The HIsarna technology reduces CO2 emissions and energy consumption through a number of ways, including by using iron ore and pulverised coal without having to pre-process the raw materials in separate coke, sinter or pellet factories. In the past six months, tests have been done with the use of steel scrap in the HIsarna reactor.

This showed that up to 53 percent of material added to the process could be made of scrap steel, reducing the requirement for raw materials compared to the blast furnace process.

The next steps in testing the HIsarna installation include identifying the ideal raw material mix, investigating the options to recycle steel slag, testing the use of CO2 to inject raw materials, investigating the recovery of zinc and studying the possibilities for capturing and storing CO2 expected to have the potential of reducing traditional steelmaking CO2emissions by around 80 per cent.

Around EUROS 75 million have reportedly been invested in developing HIsarna, the name being an amalgam of the ancient Celtic word for iron (Isarna) and the name of the melting vessel (Hismelt).",454,0.9975550323724747

Tata Steel said today that the existing power purchase pact between Bhushan Steel, the debt-laden company which it acquired, and Bhushan Energy is in under discussion.

The statement comes amid reports that Tata Steel has started the process of cancelling PPAs between Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Energy in a bid to cut costs.

""Bhushan Steel has a contract (power purchase agreement) with another company BEL (Bhushan Energy Ltd). There are some discussions going on at this stage so nothing has happened as yet. There is discussion regarding the contract,"" Tata Steel President Steel business and Total Quality Management (TQM) Anand Sen told reporters here.

He was speaking on the sidelines of International Conference on Minerals and mental sector organised by ITEI.

Sen further said, ""Yes, the company feels that it could be little bit more economical so they are examining the contract and discussing with the owners of BEL to have more beneficial contract on both parties.""

BEL is a subsidiary of Bhushan Steel Ltd.

When asked it the company has begun the process of cancelling PPA, Sen said that ""I don't know whether power purchase agreement is being cancelled or not but we have a power agreement with a company Bhushan Power that contract is under discussion.""

Bamnipal Steel Ltd (BNPL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Steel, had earlier successfully completed the acquisition of controlling stake of 72.65 per cent in Bhushan Steel Ltd.

Substantial debt on the balance sheet is likely to have an adverse impact on Tata Steel's ability to raise finance at competitive rates, the steel major said in its report.

This comes against the backdrop of Tata Steel earlier stating that it will raise Rs 16,500 crore through debt instruments to fund Rs 32,500 crore acquisition of Bhushan Steel Ltd (BSL).

""Substantial amount of debt on the balance sheet may have an adverse impact on the company's ability to raise finance at competitive rates,"" Tata Steel said in its Annual Report 2017-18.

Changes in assumptions underlying the carrying value of certain assets may result in the impairment of such assets, the company said.

On the financial risks facing Tata Steel, it said, fluctuation in foreign exchange rates due to volatility in financial markets is likely to impact the company's debt servicing and create uncertainties in accessing the financial markets.

It further said mitigation strategies for the financial risks would be ""maximising operational cashflow"", ""terming out debt and refinancing debt with favourable covenants,"" and ""appropriate foreign exchange hedging policies"", among others.

On the operational risks facing the company, Tata Steel said the steel industry was prone to high proportion of fixed costs and volatility in the prices of raw materials and energy and added that the limitations or disruptions in the supply of raw materials could adversely affect the company's profitability.

The report further said any labour dispute or social unrest in regions where the company operates may adversely affect its operations and financial condition.

Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp had earlier signed a definitive agreement to combine European steel business. The merger would create an entity that would be the continent's second largest steel company after ArcelorMittal.

Tata Steel had earlier won the bid to acquire debt-laden BSL in an insolvency auction. The bankrupt firm was among the 12 stressed assets the RBI had referred for NCLT proceedings last year.

JM Financial's research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel reported consolidated EBITDA of INR 64.7bn, in-line with JMfe. Indian operations delivered a multi quarter high EBITDA per ton of INR 17k driven by higher realisations. Corus performance improved significantly, driven by higher realisation and better operational efficiency. Strong performance in standalone and European operations were significantly offset by an adverse forex movement of c.INR 11bn at financing entities. Bhushan Steel reported an EBITDA of 46bn in 1QFY19 implying an EBITDA/t of INR 9.7k/ton. We continue to remain positive on the steel cycle and factor in normalized spreads for Indian and European businesses for FY19/20E.

Outlook

Management’s firm commitment to a sustainable net debt/EBITDA in light of further inorganic opportunities is likely to be the key determinant of stock performance going forward. Maintain BUY.

TSE delivered EBITDA/t of US$100/t (PLe:US$70) due to better availability of Hot strip mill and expansion in spreads.

Outlook

However, the structural restructuring of Chinese mill’s operating model (with profitability being the top priority), strong fundamentals of domestic market and ample growth options would drive steady return and payback on these acquired assets. We reiterate BUY with TP of Rs770, EV/EBITDA 6x FY20E.

Bhushan Steel, and its erstwhile promoters, have been previously accused of “siphoning off over Rs 2,000 crore” from loans availed by it “by using more than 80 companies”, according the Finance Ministry.

But a source close to the investigation said the SFIO has discovered a lot more illegal transactions than was previously thought. It has discovered instances where money taken from banks was used to put down as promoter equity for further loans, fund purchases such as property and expensive cars, or outright take them out through more than hundred shell companies. The SFIO is also probing certain cash payments the company had made, the source said.

The SFIO has arrested Neeraj Singhal, the erstwhile Promoter and Vice-Chairman of Bhushan Steel. This was the first arrest by the SFIO since it was given the power last year in fraud investigations. The SFIO was in August 2017, granted the powers to arrest people for violations of companies law, with the government notifying relevant provisions amid the crackdown on illicit fund flows.

Bhushan Steel is one of the 12 big cases that had been referred for insolvency resolution by banks. The company was referred to the NCLT last year after accumulating over Rs 50,000 crore debt.

Revenue during the quarter grew by 27.6 percent to Rs 37,832.8 crore from Rs 29,657.3 crore in year-ago, led by growth in all subsidiaries on strong steel demand.

""Tata Steel delivered strong performance across all geographies on the back of strong steel demand and buoyant spreads,"" T V Narendran, CEO & Managing Director said.

""All verticals saw strong growth, with automotive and branded products segments now contributing to 19 percent and 33 percent of total volumes, respectively,"" Narendran said.

Tata Steel's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased 30 percent year-on-year to Rs 6,467.6 crore and margin expanded by 30 basis points to 17.1 percent in Q1.

Better realisations and improved operational efficiencies in India business, and higher selling price and better operational performance in Europe boosted consolidated EBITDA. India EBITDA per tonne stood at Rs 17,252.

Narendran said company expects underlying steel demand to be strong, particularly in India. ""However, the rising trade tensions and the impact on the global economic momentum is a cause of concern.""

Tata Steel Europe's revenue increased 17 percent year-on-year to Rs 16,429.31 crore with EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) rising 33 percent to Rs 1,666.21 crore for the quarter ended June 2018.

Tata Steel Europe (TSE) also saw stronger profitability with an improvement in spreads and operational performance, Narendran said.

TSE deliveries improved by 1.9 percent YoY to 2.45 million tonnes in Q1FY19, however, declined by 3.8 percent QoQ in seasonally weaker quarter.

Company's standalone profit shot up 358 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,318 crore and revenue increased 26 percent to Rs 16,405.5 crore in Q1FY19. EBITDA surged 75 percent to Rs 5,118 crore and margin expanded 883 basis points to 31.2 percent compared to year-ago.

Tata Steel India's total deliveries grew by 7.9 percent YoY to 2.97 million tonnes in Q1FY19; domestic deliveries grew by 13.7 percent YoY, much stronger than 9.2 percent YoY overall steel demand growth in India, the company said.

India's crude steel output grew six percent to 8.73 million tonne (MT) during July 2018, according to an official data. The country had produced 8.22 MT crude steel during the same month a year ago, Joint Plant Committee (JPC) said in its latest report.

JPC, under Ministry of Steel, is the only institution in the country that collects and maintains data on the domestic iron and steel sector.

State-run SAIL, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL), Tata Steel, Essar Steel, JSW Steel and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) together produced 5.23 MT during July. This was 9.48 percent more compared to 4.78 MT the six players had produced in July 2017.

The contribution of other producers also grew 1.4 percent to 3.49 MT during the month, it added.

The output of hot metal was at 5.94 MT as compared to 5.44 MT in the year-ago month. While 4.98 MT was produced by the six companies, the rest 0.96 MT came from other producers.

Output of pig iron rose 9 percent to 0.49 MT from 0.45 MT in July 2017.

According to World Steel Organisation (worldsteel), India outstripped Japan to become the second largest steel producer as its steel output grew 3.43 percent to 8.43 MT in February against 8.29 MT of the latter.

Bhushan Steel Ltd today reported a standalone net profit of Rs 2,104.3 crore for the June 2018 quarter as against a net loss of Rs 1,486.13 crore in the year-ago period.

The company reported total revenue from operations at Rs 4,623.6 crore in the June 2018 quarter as compared to Rs 4,176.12 crore in the April-June 2017 quarter, it said in a BSE filing.

In May this year, Bhushan Steel -- which has been acquired by Tata Steel under the insolvency process -- had sought 90 days extension to file its audited financial results for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2018.

The profit was driven by redemption of 10 percent redeemable cumulative preference shares of Rs 100 each amounting to Rs 2,425.57 crores for a total sum of Rs. 4,700 only. The gain arising out of redemption is recorded as exceptional item, the company told exchanges in earnings release.

The filing submitted today showed the company had registered a standalone net loss of Rs 21,252.91 crore in the March 2018 quarter as against a net loss of Rs 1,607.06 crore in the year-ago period.

Its revenue from operations was at Rs 4,495.98 crore in the March 2018 quarter as against Rs 4,558.93 crore in the year-ago period.

The filing said the Board has ""approved change in name of the company from Bhushan Steel Limited to Tata Steel BL Limited or such other name, as may be approved by the Registrar of Companies, Central Registration Centre, subject to the approval of the members of the Company and the Central Government"".

Tata Steel acquired 72.65 percent in the debt-laden firm for Rs 158.89 crore and provided additional funds to the tune of Rs 35,073.69 crore to Bhushan Steel by way of debt/convertible debt.

The remaining 27.35 percent of Bhushan Steel's share capital will be held by Bhushan Steel's existing shareholders and the financial creditors who received shares in exchange for the debt owed to them, the filing said.

""The funds received by Bhushan Steel as debt and equity have been used to settle the sustainable debts owed to the existing financial creditors of Bhushan Steel, CIRP costs and employee dues by payment of Rs 35232.58 crore,"" it added.",390,-0.9669644236564636

JSW Steel recorded a 3x jump in its profits during Q1FY19 helped by higher steel prices, but the next few quarters would be critical. In the current fiscal, volume growth is expected to be in the region of 4 percent to about 16 million tonne (capacity of 18 million tonne).

Thankfully, the Supreme Court has lifted curb on iron ore mining from 30 million tonne earlier to 35 million tonne. Additionally, new mines are now getting operational and would reduce JSW's dependence in iron ore imports and local procurements helping in reduced cost and better margins. While cost per tonne should remain under control, movement of global steel prices from hereon would have a huge bearing on its growth. China's slowdown and tensions over trade war may cause volatility.

JSW’s realisations have moved up swiftly from about Rs 38000 per tonne in September 2017 quarter to about Rs 49000 a tonne in June 2018 quarter on the back of higher steel prices. That apart, integration of its recent acquisition of Italy’s Aferpi, US-based Acero and Monnet Ispat in India along with their resultant debt would weigh on its performance. Monnet Ispat would be merged into JSW Steel and management is hoping to turnaround its operations in a year.

Quarterly results

JSW Steel, whose earnings are highly sensitive to steel prices, reported 3 times jump in its net profit for the quarter ended June 2018. A combination of 11 percent year on year increase in saleable steel volumes to 3.76 million tonne and about 25 percent growth in realisation helped company to post strong 38 percent year on year growth in sales boosting its operating profits by 119 percent to Rs 5105 crore.

While the cost per tonne of steel went up marginally, the company was able to absorb the cost pressure as a result of strong growth in operating margins. During the quarter, the company made an EBIDTA of close to Rs 12,590 per tonne, which is up by almost 100 percent compared with the corresponding quarter last year. Its international businesses including the US business made a higher contribution thus helping in better profitability. Its US-based pipe and plate mill saw 2x growth in EBITDA to USD 10.7 million.

Outlook and valuations

Domestic steel demand is strong and picking up particularly in the light of consolidation in the sector. Companies like Tata Steel and JSW Steel have been biggest beneficiaries. In the current fiscal, JSW Steel should be reporting a net profit in the region of about Rs 7500-8000 crore. Taking that into account, at current market price of Rs 311 a share, the stock is trading at 9.4-10 times, which is reasonable.

The world’s most astute investor and businessman Warren Buffett once admitted to losing a huge sum of money letting sunk cost fallacy (infusing more and more capital to salvage an original investment) play out by keeping alive the loss-making textile business of Berkshire Hathaway. He eventually rectified the mistake and gradually moved capital to more profitable and viable businesses.

The lost opportunityA similar story is brewing at Tata Steel which is significantly curtailing its European exposure after Corus acquisition in 2007 led to a lot of cash burn and loss of opportunity cost.

JSW Steel, which last year generated a revenue of about Rs 70,000 crore, commands a market capitalisation of close to Rs 74,000 crore. Contrary to this, Tata Steel, with annual sales of Rs 1,31,000 crore, has a mcap of less than Rs 60,000 crore.

The restructuringThe company recently signed a 50:50 JV with Thyssenkrupp to combine its troubled European business with the later along with a transfer of debt. This is an important evolution in Tata Steel’s history as it will result in the hiving of its European business and deleverage the balance sheet, which has been the biggest drag on growth and market performance.

Tata Steel has a consolidated debt of about Rs 94,000 crore. Of this, the European business accounts for about $8 billion. Under the deal, a debt of Rs 20,000 crore would be transferred to the JV. This would lead to substantial reduction in the group’s financial leverage.

Focus returns to domestic operationsIt would be a huge rectification of its capital misallocation. During FY18, non-India sales turnover was Rs 73,000 crore, contributing a meagre profit before tax and exceptional items of Rs 1,500 crore. In contrast, Indian operations had less sales (Rs 60,519 crore in FY18) but profit before tax and exceptional items of Rs 10,000 crore. Not just Europe, its southeast Asian operations posted an earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation (EBIDTA) per tonne of Rs 1,740 in FY18, which hardly justifies investment and management focus when one compares it with the average India EBIDTA/t of Rs 13,003.

Better late than neverThe management seems to be realising the huge opportunity it is missing in India. As per media reports, it is looking to exit its southeast Asian businesses spread in markets like Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam at valuations of about Rs 3,500 crore. Its southeast Asian operation delivered around Rs 10,000 crore in sales, with a mere Rs 437 crore in EBIDTA. This geography contributes close to 8 percent to group sales and less than 2 percent of group EBIDTA.

It could be a positive move as it will help reduce group leverage. In FY18, group debt-to-equity stood at 1.5 times and net debt-to-EBITDA stood at 3.3 times. While this is comfortable, it can turn risky in light of the Rs 35,000 crore acquisition of Bhushan Steel and about Rs 23,500 crore capex for Kalinganagar expansion (5 million tonne).

As against the current annual production of about 12 million tonne, it aspires to touch 24 million tonne by FY22. This would require additional capital and would lead to higher leverage, thus making it even more imperative to divest or completely exit these assets. These moves (Europe and South East Asia) could unlock additional capital, which can be ploughed back into its profitable businesses.

Tata Steel may raise around USD 3.1 billion through overseas loans to repay existing debt, ahead of the merger of its European operations with Thyssenkrupp, according to a report by The Economic Times.

The raised amount will replace part of the existing debt held by its European businesses, the pricing for which would be done sometime in August.

Tata Steel has started negotiations with multiple banks, including Barclays, JPMorgan, Mitsubishi UFJ Group, DBS Bank and Citigroup, the report suggests.

“The aim is to replace them before September quarter. This will substantially reduce debt burden on Tata Steel’s consolidated operations. The new debt will be cheaper by 30-40 basis points from the current level,” a source told the newspaper.

The steel manufacturer may raise the loan for a period of two to five years, adding a markup over LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), the report adds.

Tata Steel has agreed to transfer two-third of its USD 18-billion debt to the new joint venture with Thyssenkrupp. The company will service the remaining debt with this loan.

In June, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp signed definitive agreements to combine their European steel businesses in a 50/50 joint venture in a new company.",210,0.9187446236610413

Tata Steel is planning to sell some of its South-East Asian businesses in order to focus on the Indian market, The Economic Times reported.

The company has appointed a banker in Singapore to look for buyers for its subsidiaries NatSteel Holdings Pte Ltd (Singapore) and Tata Steel Thailand, the report said.

The Tata Group company has valued these businesses at around $500 million. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the news.

Both units have reported negative growth in operational profit, despite improved selling prices, primarily because of the negative sentiment in the construction sector in both Singapore and Thailand and elevated scrap prices, the company said in its annual report for 2017-2018.

Tata Steel acquired NatSteel in 2004 and Millennium Steel in 2006. Millennium Steel's name was later changed to Tata Steel (Thailand).

The turnover from the South-East Asian businesses was Rs 9,542 crore in FY18, or almost 16 percent of the company's total revenue of Rs 60,519 crore.

But with a profit of Rs 437 crore, the businesses contributed only roughly 2 percent of its total EBITDA of Rs 22,045 crore.

International rating agency Fitch today said Tata Steel Europe's agreement with German industrial major ThyssenKrupp to create a joint venture will improve its credit and business profiles as it will reduce its exposure to structural weaknesses in the region.

However, the gain will probably be offset by a relatively high level of leverage over the next two to three years due to acquisitions back home to expand market share, the agency warned in a report.

It also hinted at resolving the rating watch on the ratings of both the companies after the completion of the JV transaction by 2018-end.

Loss-making Tata Steel Europe and Thyssenkrupp had on June 30 singed an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture, which will be the second-largest European flat-steel producer with annual shipments of about 21 million tonnes.

Tata Steel will transfer around 2.5 billion euros of term debt to the JV, while Thyssenkrupp will transfer pension liabilities of 3.6 billion euros.

The JV will make cost synergies of 400-500 million euors annually to be realised within two-three years.

""Leverage remains a concern for Tata Steel. We estimate the ratio of total adjusted debt to pre-tax profit will remain above four times over the next three years, little changed from the 4.4 times leverage in the year to March 2018. This is significantly higher than the level of around 2.5 times for a 'BB' category rating in general, as per our rating,"" Fitch said.

Tata Steel is on an acquisition spree back home with snapping up Bhushan Steel for over Rs 35,000 crore and Bhushan Power & Steel for Rs 24,200 crore, apart from an over Rs 23,00 crore expansion of its Kalinganagar plant. This will increase its debt by around Rs 80,000 crore.

""We have assumed Ebitda of around Rs 45,000 crore from Bhushan Steel in FY20, based on an output of five million tonne and an Ebitda per tonne of around Rs 9,000 for the plant, which does not benefit from the use of captive raw materials,"" the agency said, adding the company will have around Rs 10,000 crore annual capex over the next three years.

The agency sees an operating margin of per tonne for its domestic operations (ex-acquisitions) of around Rs 13,000 in FY19, similar to the FY18 level, dropping slightly to around Rs 12,500 annually thereafter.",399,0.4500027894973755

The Supervisory Board of German steel major Thyssenkrupp today accepted the resignation of its CEO Heinrich Hiesinger in ""mutual agreement"" and reiterated its backing for a merger with Tata Steel.

Hiesinger made the shock announcement about his exit as Chief Executive Officer of the company yesterday.

It came just days after he joined Tata Steel Chairman N Chandrasekaran at a joint press conference in Brussels to welcome a ""new steel champion in Europe"" following an agreement on a joint venture with the Indian steel major.

In a statement after a board meeting today, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Thyssenkrupp Ulrich Lehner said the company remained committed to the Indian joint venture, which is set to create Europe's second-largest steel-maker after Lakshmi N Mittal's Arcelor Mittal.

""In this tough situation for the company it is now initially about staying on course... This includes the realisation of the steel joint venture. For this we reached an important milestone with the signing,"" said Lehner, in reference to the definitive agreement signed with Tata last week.

He also praised Hiesinger's leadership of the German steel giant over the last seven years.

""He kept the company from its demise and changed it sustainably. During his time, he created the basis for Thyssenkrupp to exist as a strong industrial company in accordance with the principles of the foundation,"" Lehner said, adding that his decision to step down at this point ""deserves our highest esteem and respect"".

The company's Supervisory Board has asked the Board – comprising Guido Kerkhoff, Oliver Burkhard and Donatus Kaufmann – to lead without a Chief Executive Officer for the time being as the successor for Hiesinger will be appointed following a ""structured process"".

Hiesinger is seen as instrumental in achieving the 50-50 JV agreement with Tata Steel, which is set to create a mega steel company made up of 48,000 employees and sales worth 17 billion euros after all regulatory clearances.

In the event of a stock market flotation of the business in future, Thyssenkrupp would receive 55 percent of the proceeds and would get to dictate the timing of any flotation.

However, according to reports, this deal did not satisfy all of the German firm's shareholders, some of whom believed Thyssenkrupp had got the poor end of the deal.

The merger has been widely welcomed by workers' unions in Britain as the best solution to ensure the long-term future of Tata Steel's UK operations.

The CEO of German industrial giant Thyssenkrupp yesterday announced his resignation, just days after he hailed the ""historic"" merger of the company's steelmaking business with Tata Steel.

In a move that came as a surprise, the company announced that Heinrich Hiesinger has asked the Supervisory Board of the company to end his mandate as Chief Executive Officer of Thyssenkrupp AG ""in mutual agreement"".

Hiesinger said: ""Today I informed the Supervisory Board that I would like to step down from my position as CEO of Thyssenkrupp. I take this step very consciously to enable a fundamental discussion in the Supervisory Board on the future of Thyssenkrupp.”

A joint understanding of Board and Supervisory Board on the strategic direction of a company is a key pre-requisite for successfully leading a company, he said.

He added: ""The joint venture of our steel activities with Tata is the next significant step to turn Thyssenkrupp into a strong industrial company. We can be proud of what we achieved until now.

“For this I would like to thank all employees. They are the most valuable capital of Thyssenkrupp.”

Tata Steel's 50-50 joint venture with Germany's Thyssenkrupp has created Europe's second-largest steel company after Lakshmi Mittal's ArcelorMittal. The JV combines the European steel businesses of the Indian steel major with the German firm to create Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel BV. The new steel company will have a total workforce of 48,000 employees spread across 34 sites.

Prof Ulrich Lehner, chairman of the supervisory board, praised the outgoing CEO and said that the Board, under the leadership of Hiesinger, has freed Thyssenkrupp from an “existential crisis” and made the company ready for the future by implementing the strategy which was agreed by the Supervisory Board.

“Without Heinrich Hiesinger there would be no Thyssenkrupp today.

Tata Steel Chairman N Chandrasekaran today welcomed the definitive agreement with German steel major Thyssenkrupp to create a new joint venture company as a ""historic"" development that would strengthen the steel industry across Europe and India.

Chandrasekaran was addressing a joint press conference with Thyssenkrupp CEO Heinrich Hiesinger in Brussels after the creation of Europe's second-largest steel giant after Lakshmi Mittal's ArcelorMittal in the form of the new JV company was announced over the weekend.

""For Tata, this marks a significant milestone in the history of Tata Steel and the Tata Group. It strengthens and provides scale to our European operations, creates a strong steel enterprise and also helps the Indian operations to grow and address the needs of the Indian market,"" he told reporters.

Addressing a question on what the new company, named Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel BV, would mean for Tata Steel employees in India, he described it as a ""great development"" for all employees.

""We are structurally strong in India, which offers tremendous opportunities as a growing market. This JV creates an opportunity for us to create a good, strong and sustainable footprint in both geographies,"" he said.

Chandrasekaran also asserted Tata Steel's plans to ""double down"" in India, where the company plans to increase its presence from 13 million tonnes to 25 million tonnes a year capacity.

In reference to the company's recent acquisition of Bhushan Steel in India, he indicated that Tata Steel was negotiating another acquisition in India as part of its focus on creating a ""strong Indian platform"" through Brownfield and Greenfield opportunities.

Tata Steel's new 50-50 joint venture with Thyssenkrupp involves a total workforce of 48,000 employees, spread across 34 sites, producing about 21 million tonnes of steel a year with revenues of around EUROS 15 billion.

As the second-largest European steel company, after Lakshmi N. Mittal's ArcelorMittal, the company has forecast cost savings of between 350 million pounds to 440 million pounds a year as it becomes a ""one balance sheet"" entity.

""There is industrial logic and strategic rationale behind this merger, which creates a new steel champion in Europe…We are forming something great, which expresses our trust in the successful future for the steel business in Europe,"" said Thyssenkrupp CEO Hiesinger.

The JV will now undergo routine clearance process, with the new company board set to be announced within a few weeks. Both entities expressed confidence in being able to navigate the upheavals in store as a result of ongoing Brexit negotiations and US tariff wars, with Hiesinger expressing hope that a free market context will be maintained for the steel industry.

""Having integrated plants across Europe, gives us some flexibility… but we will hope for free flow,"" he said.

""We need to wait and see what the outcome of Brexit is,"" added Chandrasekaran.

The definitive agreement signed between the two companies includes a ""proper compensation"" for a valuation gap between the companies, which means that in case of an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of the JV, Thyssenkrupp will receive a higher share of the proceeds, reflecting an economic ratio of 55/45. Both companies stressed that the timing of the IPO is some way off, as the initial focus would be on kick-starting JV operations following the required regulatory approvals and ""building credibility"" of the new company.

The merger has been widely welcomed by workers' unions in Britain as the best solution to ensure the long-term future of Tata Steel's UK operations. The Indian company owns the UK's largest steelworks in Port Talbot, South Wales, employing thousands of staff.

""All sides of the JV will have appropriate support to prosper and progress under the new enterprise,"" said Koushik Chatterjee, Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer of Tata Steel.

The new company's complete production network is to be reviewed starting in 2020, with the aim of integrating and optimising the production strategy for the entire joint venture.

Until the JV gets all its clearances, Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe and Tata Steel in Europe still operate as separate companies and as competitors.",678,0.9904928803443909

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Steel

After a gap of nine months of signing MoU, Tata Steel (TATA) and ThyssenKrupp AG finally entered into a definitive agreement to form a 50:50 Joint Venture (JV) for merger of their European steel operations. The conditions of agreement remained unchanged except increase in ThyssenKrupp’s economic interest to 55% in case of IPO. The decision on timing of JV’s IPO would also rest exclusively with ThyssenKrupp. The JV would make combined entity the 2nd largest Flat steel producer in Europe with deliveries/revenue/EBITDA of 21mn tonnes/€17bn/€1.7bn (based on last four trailing quarters). It will have debt of €6.5bn that includes a) senior debt of €2.5bn carved out of Tata steel Europe (TSE) and b) €4bn of unfunded pension and other legacy liabilities of ThyssenKrupp. JV expects synergies of €400‐500mn/year, realisable in full from third year of JV formation. Management expects to close the transaction by Q4FY19.

Outlook

We reiterate that JV is structurally positive for TATA given the strong asset base with margins upwards of US$90/t (at par with ArcelorMittal), effective reduction in Net debt/EBITDA of European operations by ~40% to 5.8x and improved gearing. Led by strong outlook on Indian operations and attractive JV, we maintain BUY with a TP of Rs815.

Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp AG on Saturday signed definitive agreements to combine their European steel businesses in a 50/50 joint venture in a new company.

This follows the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2017.

The new company will be called ThyssenKrupp Tata Steel BV, and will be based in Netherlands. The merged entity will have capacity to produce 21 million tons of steel a year, making it the second largest steelmaker in Europe after ArcelorMittal.

ThyssenKrupp Tata Steel BV will have 48,000 employees across 34 sites. The company will have a revenue of about Euros 15 billion.

The combined entity is expected to make an annual savings of up to Euros 500 million.

The transaction is subject to merger control clearance in several jurisdictions, including the European Union.

“The joint venture will create a strong pan European steel company that is structurally robust and competitive. This is a significant milestone for Tata Steel and we remain fully committed to the long-term interest of the joint venture company,"" said Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Steel.

Dr. Heinrich Hiesinger, CEO of ThyssenKrupp AG, added, ""We will secure jobs and contribute to maintaining value chains in European core industries.”

A statement from Tata Steel said that the two European entities will continue to function as separate companies until the completion of the JV process.

While the JV gives equal shareholding to the two companies, ThyssenKrupp will get a bigger share from the proceedings out of an expected IPO of the JV.

This comes after demands from workers union and shareholders of the Germany company that Tata Steel needs to compensate for the differing performance of the two companies since September last year. While Tata Steel's EBITDA has declined by a fifth, that of its German partner has increased by a third since the announcement of the deal last year.

Reports said that the deal would include a compensation for ThyssenKrupp, but the details are awaited.

The two sides also declined to give a timeline for the completion of the JV process, but it is widely expected to get over by December.",367,0.48163802921772003

Talks to hammer out the final details are progressing well and a compromise has been reached for how to close a valuation gap that has emerged between both businesses, three of the people said, without elaborating.

Sources told Reuters this month that options included a cash payment to Thyssenkrupp, changing the 50-50 ownership structure of the venture, lowering the debt to be transferred to it, or limiting dividend payments to Tata Steel for a number of years.

Bhushan Steel today said stock exchanges have approved reclassification of its erstwhile promoters, who collectively hold around 3.47 per cent of stake in the company, as public shareholders following its takeover by Tata Steel.

Bamnipal Steel Limited, a wholly-owned arm of Tata Steel Ltd, is the sole promoter of Bhushan Steel, holding 72.65 per cent of the paid-up share capital of the company, the steel maker said in a filing to BSE.

Bamnipal Steel had completed the acquisition of a controlling stake in Bhushan Steel Ltd (BSL) last month.

""National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE) and BSE Ltd (BSE)....has approved the re-classification of erstwhile promoters of the company i.e. Neeraj Singal; Brij Bhushan Singal; Ritu Singal; Aishwarya Singal; Brij Bhushan Singal; and Bhushan Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, collectively holding in aggregate 3.47 per cent of paid-up share capital of the company as the public category shareholders,"" Bhushan Steel said.

Tata Steel, which emerged as the biggest bidder for Bhushan Steel with a Rs 32,500-crore deal in the insolvency process, completed the acquisition of controlling stake of 72.65 per cent in the debt-laden firm on May 18.

Post takeover, Tata Steel had said that it will raise Rs 16,500 crore through debt instruments to fund Rs 32,500 crore acquisition of Bhushan Steel Ltd.

The remaining amount will be raised through internal resources, it had said.

Thyssenkrupp workers on Thursday urged management to solve outstanding issues in talks with Tata Steel to create a European joint venture, signalling they would not be opposed to a further delay of the transaction if necessary.

The remarks come as Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger finds himself under pressure from all sides to present a deal that will satisfy employees and investors, which have grown increasingly frustrated with the lengthy negotiations.

""There are still a number of unresolved issues until a possible signing,"" Tekin Nasikkol, chairman of Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe's works council and a member of Thyssenkrupp AG's supervisory board, said in a statement.

""We expect all parties to focus on diligence rather than speed in fixing the problems.""

Talks to create a European steel joint venture have dragged on for more than two years and have hit a snag after the diverging performance of the two businesses prompted Thyssenkrupp's activist shareholders Elliott and Cevian to ask for better terms.

Hiesinger has several options to address the valuation gap and is seeking approval for the venture from Thyssenkrupp's 20-member supervisory board, where half of the seats are held by labour representatives, by the end of next week.

""If Mr Hiesinger needs more time he can have it as far as I'm concerned,"" Nasikkol said.

Hiesinger's options range from changing the 50-50 ownership structure, possibly to 55-45 or 60-40 in favour of Thyssenkrupp, transferring more Thyssenkrupp debt onto the venture, excluding Tata Steel from dividend payments or securing a cash payment from the Indian firm to settle the difference.

Nasikkol confirmed labour leaders would not support the venture taking on more debt. So far, Thyssenkrupp plans to transfer 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion) in liabilities, compared with Tata Steel's 2.5 billion.",302,-0.9999964237213135

Tata Steel Europe’s proposed merger with Thyssenkrupp’s steel business in the continent is crucial for the two companies’ future.

While Tata Steel wants to channel its resources and regain dominance in the domestic market, for Thyseenkrupp, the merger is crucial for its long-term strategy to become an engineering conglomerate.

Much of the responsibility for the merger’s success lies on the shoulders of two men – TV Narendran, Tata Steel’s Global CEO and Managing Director, and his German counterpart Heinrich Hiesinger, CEO, Thyssenkrupp.

India focus

Narendran, who in 2013 took over as the Managing Director for India and South Asia, was promoted last year. He became Tata Steel’s first ever Global CEO and Managing Director.

Also, Group Executive Director and CFO Koushik Chatterjee was redesignated as Executive Director and CFO. Chatterjee had earlier led many of the negotiations at Tata Steel Europe and now had his sight on the Indian side of operations.

The change in designations reflected Tata Steel’s changing priority – to get back the numero uno position in the Indian market, which is among the fastest growing in the world. Meanwhile, the European market, especially the UK, is still to get back to its pre-2008 levels.

Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran had already set the target for India market, which was to double the domestic capacity from 13 million tonnes a year. The company has already added 5 million tons to it, with the acquisition of Bhushan Steel. The deal has taken Tata Steel past JSW Steel as India's largest steelmaker. The Tata company is also among the favourites to bag Bhushan Power & Steel and Usha Martin.

These acquisitions add to Tata Steel’s capacity expansion plans at Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar.

Tata Steel Europe, on the other hand, continues to reel under adverse economic conditions and bloated costs. The parent has bore the brunt, burning up to USD 1 billion a year because of the European operations.

The deal

Terms of the merger, which was signed in September last year, are still being worked out and the two companies may come up with an initial agreement by the end of this month. But even as the deadline looks like a tough one now, a report by rating agency Moody’s reiterated the positives of the merger.

The agency said that the merger will lead to initial savings of up to 600 million euros. The new entity, in which both Tata Steel and Thyssenkurpp will hold equal equity, will become the second-largest steelmaker in Europe after ArcelorMittal.

Future strategy

But the last couple of weeks have seen pressure mounting on Hiesinger to rework the merger terms. Some of the prominent shareholders, and labour union representatives, have pointed out the differing financial performance of Tata Steel Europe and Thyssenkrupp.

While Tata Steel Europe’s EBITDA has declined by a fifth since the merger was announced, that of Thyssenkrupp has risen by a third.

Despite the fresh challenges, Hiesinger is keen that the merger goes ahead. The veteran, who joined the company in 2011, sees the merger as an important part of his plan to revive the company and make it into an engineering giant.

Apart from the steel business, Thyssenkrupp has varied interests, ranging from submarines to elevators.

But Hiesinger hasn’t delivered yet, at least in the eyes of investors. Thyssenkrupp’s shares have lost 30 percent since he took over in 2011.

The merger will not just save his plan for Thyssenkrupp, but also perhaps cement his place in the conglomerate.",591,0.31962360739707946

The proposed merger between Tata Steel Europe and Thyssenkrupp of Germany, forming an equal joint venture, is likely to consolidate the European steel sector and may lead to lower costs over time, a report said.

Last September, Thyssenkrupp AG and Tata Steel UK had said they would combine their steel making capacities in Europe into an equal joint venture. This would make their combined operations the second largest in the continent, after ArcelorMittal.

""Market concentration in carbon steel will increase following the planned merger of Tata Steel with Thyssenkrupp and ArcelorMittal's buyout of Italy's largest steelmaker Ilva.

""Assuming these large deals are completed, further consolidation will likely come in from smaller steelmakers seeking to scale up their operations to better compete with these two larger groups,"" Moody's said in its report today.

The agency also sees scope for M&As in the specialty steel sector.

While Tata- Thyssenkrupp deal is potentially capable of delivering the largest synergies to the tune of 400-600 million euros initially, ArcelorMittal is aiming to make over 300 million euros from the Ilva deal, it said.

However the report said the merger will not reduce current overcapacity in Europe as the curbs placed by trade unions and local authorities limit capacity reductions.

The ongoing excess capacity may become a source of vulnerability in the next cyclical downturn or if significant imports designated for the US get redirected to Europe as a result of the US tariffs on steel.

""We believe that larger groups like ArcelorMittal and Tata-Thyssenkrupp would be better positioned given their economies of scale. The increased consolidation should benefit the industry by bringing higher economies of scale and making the largest European groups more competitive in terms of cost.

""This should make them more resilient in the next downturn, which could exacerbate the problem of overcapacity in Europe,"" Moody's said.

The agency believes that ArcelorMittal's acquisition of Ilva will also increase price discipline between the Northern and Southern European markets, which has been disrupted by Ilva's very aggressive pricing in the past.",347,0.15100031239645823

Based on the reconstitution of Sensex from June 18, 2018, the earnings per share (EPS) of Sensex is set to get an upgrade of 1.7/1.8 percent, Motilal Oswal has said in a report. The brokerage house has attributed this to the increase in free flat PAT (+2.3 percent/2.4 percent for FY19/FY20) than in free float market cap (0.5 percent).

Going forward, it expects the Sensex EPS to be Rs 1,870 for FY19 and Rs 2,241 for FY20, an increase of 36 and 20 percent, respectively. “Excluding corporate banks such as SBI, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, the profits of Sensex are expected to be posted around 24 percent for FY19,” the report added.

Speaking on the rejig, the brokerage observed that weight of metals is set to increase by 130 basis points to 2.6 percent, while healthcare counterpart is set to hit an eight-year low.

“Vedanta will be included in the benchmark, with weight of 1.3 percent, taking Metals’ weight to 2.6 percent (+130bp). With this inclusion, the metals sector will have two stocks in the benchmark (Tata Steel having 1.3 percent weight),” analysts at the firm wrote in the report.

Meanwhile, with the exit of Dr Reddy’s Labs (weight: 0.8 percent), healthcare stands to lose the most in terms of weight (-70bp to 1.7 percent). Earlier, in December 2017, Cipla and Lupin were excluded from the benchmark, Motilal Oswal further observed.

“Healthcare’s weight will now be at an eight-year low, with the exclusion and also due to the significant underperformance of the sector over the last two years. Sun Pharma (weight: 1.7 percent) will be the only healthcare stock in the benchmark index.”

Having said that, the least impacted sectors would be oil & gas, NBFCs, capital goods, utilities, PSU banks, telecom and infrastructure. Of the top-10 stocks to be most impacted, four are from financials.

Stocks to be hit

According to the report, the top 10 stocks to be impacted the most by the reshuffle are HDFC Bank (-6bp), Reliance Inds (-5bp), HDFC (-5bp), Infosys (-4bp), ITC (-4bp), ICICI Bank (-3bp), TCS (-3bp), L&T (-3bp), Kotak Bank (-2bp), and Maruti (-2bp).

“Top-10 stocks currently constitute 66.1 percent of the Sensex. Post reshuffle, this is likely to come down to 65.7 percent (-40bp). 58 percent of Sensex constituents have been unchanged over 10 years,” the report added.",398,0.11360303560892741

Tata Steel may be under pressure to rework the deal to merge its European operations with that of Thyssenkrupp after the Germany company's prominent shareholders demanded a compensation to fill a 'valuation gap' in the merger.

Two of Thyssenkrupp's shareholders, Elliott Management Corp and Cevian Capital, have asked the company to renegotiate the terms of the merger, which was signed by the two sides in September last year.

Under the deal terms, both sides would have an equal equity in the merged entity. The merged entity would become the second largest steelmaker in Europe, after ArcelorMittal.

But in the months following the deal, performance of the two entities has differed. A Reuters report said that since the deal was announced, Tata Steel Europe's EBITDA has declined by a fifth on an annual basis. On the other hand, EBIDTA of Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe has risen by a third.

This has prompted several stakeholders to voice their concerns. Elliott in a letter to Thyssenkrupp management said that the deal terms are now unfavourable for the German company. ""If the initial terms of the deal are maintained, it represents a shift of about 1.9 billion euros less for Thyssenkrupp,"" the fund was reported as saying.

The opposition will now add pressure on Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp as they work to save the merger, which is already delayed.

The merger was initially expected to be completed by the end of June, but the deadline was extended to December. The biggest sticking points are said to over labour agreements on job guarantees.

Unions protest

Separately, labour unions of both companies have also spoken against the merger.

Tata Steel Europe's European Works Council said that it remained unconvinced that the partnership would be of the best interests for employees.

On the other hand, Thyssenkrupp's labour representatives have aired concerns over the viability of Tata Steel Europe's operations.

Tata Steel's European labour representatives said they remain unconvinced by a planned joint venture with Thyssenkrupp, adding there were still numerous details that needed to be hammered out before they could endorse a deal.

The remarks by Tata Steel Europe's European Works Council (EWC) threatens a further delay to a deal to combine Thyssenkrupp's steel operations with Tata's European steel business, a pact which has not been signed because of resistance from Dutch workers.

""The EWC acknowledges there is an industrial rationale for pursuing this JV, but with the matters outstanding the EWC remains unconvinced that this partnership with Thyssenkrupp would be in the best interests of the Tata Steel Europe's operations and the employees we represent,"" it said in a statement.

Thyssenkrupp said in May it expected to be able to sign the deal with Tata Steel, agreed in principle last September, in the first half of 2018. Tata Steel confirmed that timeline at the time.

The planned transaction would combine Thyssenkrupp's and Tata Steel's European steel operations to create the continent's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal with sales of 15 billion euros ($17.7 billion).

The EWC said Thyssenkrupp had been unwilling to engage and help its advisers understand the German firm's aspirations and plans with regards to the join venture, adding the financial structure of the deal remains a ""work in progress"".

A Tata Steel spokesman told Reuters: ""We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with our employee representatives throughout the process of creating the proposed joint venture.""

He added that Tata Steel is committed to delivering the joint venture without the need for compulsory redundancies.

Tata's Dutch works council said in April it still had ""major reservations"" over the joint venture, even though Tata promised limited job losses and an independent position for the Dutch operations within the new company.

The EWC, which oversees all the Tata Steel Europe trade unions, said its advisers had recommended it oppose the current business plan because it prioritises shareholder dividends over the long-term development of the joint venture.

Thyssenkrupp was not immediately available to comment.

Tata Steel Netherlands reached a preliminary agreement with Dutch unions in March, after promising job losses would be limited to between 300 and 400 supporting functions while excluding any forced redundancies until 2026.",390,-0.7989089091618856

Usha Martin announced on Monday that its board has decided to explore the sale of its steel business and has constituted a committee consisting of its independent directors to oversee the same.

""The board at its meeting held today has decided to explore the sale of its steel business in order to achieve the objective of deleveraging the company,"" Usha Martin said in a statement.

""The Board inter alia reconstituted the Committee of Independent Directors to appoint investment bankers, consultants and advisors to help evaluate proposals and oversee the process..."" added the company.

As reported by Moneycontrol, Tata Steel has joined the race for Usha Martin's steel business, located in Jamshedpur. Others in the fray include JSW Steel.

Both JSW Steel and Tata Steel are believed to have signed memorandums of understanding with Usha Martin, which allows them to evaluate the asset.

Usha Martin's integrated steel plant near Jamshedpur has a capacity to manufactures one million tonne a year.

The company has a debt of around Rs 3,700 crore, most of which is long term.

In the last financial year, it brought down its losses to Rs 282 crore from Rs 354 crore a year earlier. Its revenues in FY18 stood at Rs 4,038 crore as against Rs 3,246 a year ago.

The company law appellate tribunal today asked Tata Steel if it will clear the statutory dues like income tax and GST of Bhushan Steel, a company it had acquired in the insolvency proceedings earlier this month.

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), hearing appeals against the acquisition filed by Bhushan Steel's founding Singal family and the firm's operational creditor Larsen and Toubro, asked Tata Steel to submit a statement of statutory dues of the company.

The two member bench headed by NCLAT Chairman, Justice S J Mukhopadhaya also asked the Resolution Professional, which oversaw the auction of Bhushan Steel, to state how much would L&T get from Rs 532 crore offered to all the operational creditors.

Bhushan Steel owed its lenders about Rs 56,000 crore and was among the 12 big loan defaulters identified by the Reserve Bank of India last year to undergo insolvency under the new bankruptcy law.

Tata Steel offered Rs 35,200 crore in cash to acquire Bhushan Steel. It would pay another Rs 1,200 crore over next 12 months to creditors and convert the remaining debt owed to banks to equity.

After the entire exercise, Tata would hold 75 per cent stake and banks would get 12.27 per cent. Singal family would be left with 2.5 per cent and the remaining 10 per cent would be public holding.

While L&T wants to recover its Rs 956 crore dues, Singal family has made a Rs 28,592 crore counter-offer.

During the proceedings, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi opposed the Rs 28,592 crore offer by Neeraj Singal. ""This Rs 28,592 crore offer in 14 years is a spoiler,"" he said.

Meanwhile, senior advocate S Ganesh appearing for Singal submitted that Tata Steel was ineligible to bid for Bhushan Steel under section 29 A of IBC.

The section mandates that a person convicted for any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more is ineligible for submitting a resolution plan. Tata Steel UK, a foreign subsidiary of Tata Steel, was fined by an English Court in February 2018, he added.

The appellate tribunal has listed the matter on July 3 for next hearing.

Neeraj Singal and L&T had filed appeals challenging May 15 order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that had approved Tata Steel's bid for Bhushan Steel.",394,-0.759878933429718

Rating agency Fitch on Wednesday said Tata Steel's acquisition of controlling stake in Bhushan Steel is likely to raise its leverage over the next two to three years.

Tata Steel Ltd (TSL), which won the bid for Bhushan Steel Ltd (BSL) under the insolvency process, completed the acquisition of controlling stake of 72.65 percent in the debt-laden firm last week.

""Tata Steel Ltd's acquisition of a controlling stake in Bhushan Steel is likely to raise TSL's leverage over the next two to three years..."" Fitch Ratings said in a statement.

It has now cleared all the regulatory hurdles needed to proceed with the acquisition after India's National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved TSL's debt resolution plan for BSL on May 15, 2018, it said.

BSL, which has steelmaking capacity of around 5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), was one of five key distressed steel assets put up for bidding under insolvency proceedings in India.

""Under the resolution plan, Bhushan's financial creditors will receive Rs 352 billion for settlement of existing financial debt. This amount will be financed with new secured debt of Rs 165 billion and cash on TSL's balance sheet. TSL will subsequently acquire a 72.65 percent equity stake in Bhushan (Steel),"" Fitch said.

TSL's projected steelmaking capacity will increase to 23mtpa with the Bhushan acquisition and including TSL's own 5mtpa capacity expansion scheduled to be completed in 2022, it said.

This is in line with management's intention of doubling capacity in India from 13 MTPA in the next five years. Bhushan's main plant is relatively close, about 150 km away from TSL's Kalinganagar plant in Odisha in eastern India. Bhushan's plant is underutilised, producing around 3.5mtpa currently.

TSL believes its turnaround plan will enable the plant to reach close to 100 percent utilisation in two years, it added.

Bhushan's plant, unlike TSL's, does not benefit from use of captive raw materials currently. However, TSL envisages gains from improvement in operating metrics and from unified marketing and procurement.

Bhushan's product mix is enhanced by downstream facilities like its cold-rolling mill and galvanizing units. TSL also has the option to increase capacity at Bhushan's site in the future, which is useful given the significant time required to set up a green field plant in India.

The BSL acquisition will enable TSL to improve its domestic market share, but Fitch estimates it will raise TSL's leverage, in terms of net debt to EBITDA, to 4x over the next two to three years from around 3x at end-March 2018.

It said TSL's net debt will increase by around Rs 35,000 crore due to the acquisition, excluding additional working capital debt at Bhushan.

""We assume additional EBITDA of around INR45 billion in the second year following the acquisition, based on an output of 5 million tonnes and an EBITDA per tonne of around Rs 9,000, based on TSL successfully improving operations at Bhushan to near-optimum levels within two years,"" the Fitch statement said.

TSL has also shown interest in acquiring a controlling stake in another steel asset - Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd. The result of that bidding process is likely to be known within the next few months. A successful bid is likely to further increase TSL's leverage over the medium term, Fitch added.",552,0.976524463721684

Yes Bank said with this recovery, it now has an exposure to only one account, aggregating to only Rs 23.4 crore (with 50 per cent provision) as on March 31, 2018, from borrowers referenced in the first list of the RBI IBC NCLT process.

Earlier, it had recovered Rs 32 crore through sale of pledged shares. Total recoveries (against claims of Rs 325 crore) is Rs 216 crore (66 per cent), it said.

The NCLAT has asked Tata Steel, the resolution professional and Committee of Creditors to respond within seven days, on allegations by Neeraj Singhal that the Tata company's takeover of Bhushan Steel is against the Insolvency and Bankrupcty Code (IBC).

Neeraj Singhal is the promoter of Bhushan Steel, which has been undergoing insolvency proceedings.

On May 15, the National Company Law Tribunal had approved Tata Steel's resolution plan. Two days later, the NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal) had accepted Singhal's plea against the takeover.

The Appellate Tribunal, which refused to stay Tata Steel's takeover of Bhushan Steel, will again hear the case on May 30.

Singhal has argued that Tata Steel's bid for Bhushan Steel is ineligible under Clause 29 of the IBC.

Meanwhile, the NCLAT will hear L&T's petition on Tuesday. The engineering giant has argued that it has an outstanding due of Rs 900 crore from Bhushan Steel. But as it has been bracketed as an ""operational creditor"", there has been no provision to clear its due under the resolution plan provided by Tata Steel.

After forming multiple bullish divergences on the daily chart, Tata Steel has seen a decent pullback. It rose to Rs 637 levels recently which coincides with the daily 200-SMA.

In line with our expectations, the stock took a sharp turn and corrected towards Rs 602. The daily RSI (14) is struggling to cross 60 levels. Also, the daily chart resembles a false breakout from triangle pattern which is a bearish sign.

Hence, we recommend traders to go short in a range of Rs 610 to Rs 616 with a price target of Rs 555. A stop loss should be placed at Rs 634 on a daily closing basis.

Delay in approving final resolutions in several of the large insolvency cases is raising governance concerns among some of the participants in the bidding process.

This comes at a time when promoters, employees and other stakeholders are challenging and moving higher courts against some of the insolvency cases, including big ones such as Monnet Ispat and Bhushan Steel, which are approaching final resolutions after being cleared by the lenders under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

Koushik Chatterjee, executive director and chief financial officer at Tata Steel said, ""In the short term, the delay in the process is a concern…The fact is that what is happening on the ground, the health of the assets, the way it is being maintained, the commercial transactions happening on the ground, whether there are appropriate checks and controls on purchases and sales..""

He added, ""These things worry us as we have valued it on the basis of it being a going concern. We don’t even get to go into the plant…it is already 270 days and any further delay is a concern.""

Tata Steel has won the bid to buy Bhushan Steel, which is one of the 12 non-performing loan accounts (NPA) and among the early ones facing insolvency proceedings on the Reserve Bank of India’s directions.

The NCLT gave a go-ahead after the committee of creditor (CoC) approved Rs 32,500-crore deal with 12.27 percent equity to lenders as financial creditors and Tata Steel owning 72.65 percent equity in Bhushan Steel. It will also pay Rs 1,200 crore to operational creditors and will also absorb about 5,000 employees of Bhushan Steel as part of the process.

A day after the NCLT approval, Neeraj Singal, the aggrieved promoter of Bhushan Steel owing 22 percent stake in the company, moved the appellate tribunal challenging the NCLT order. Moreover, Bhushan Steel’s employees and operational creditor Larsen and Toubro had also opposed Tata Steel’s bid fearing non-payment of dues but was dismissed by the NCLT.

Like Tata Steel, JSW Steel is also facing hurdles at the NCLT approval stage in buying Monnet Ispat, which has been approved by the CoC and cleared by Competition Commission of India (CCI). JSW along with Aion Investments has bid for Monnet Ispat for about Rs 3,750 crore.

JSW Steel joint managing director and chief financial officer Seshagiri Rao also expressed similar views saying, “Eventually every case is going to the Supreme Court so IBC will take a long process. We will wait for the hearings on the Monnet case…But we are not moving court against anything as of now.”

Of the top 12 cases under insolvency process, except Electrosteel Steels, most cases are stuck before various courts for final approval of bidders or a resolution plan despite most of the 270-day deadlines having ended in April.

Similar delays have been seen in other accounts too.

In the case of Jaiprakash Associates has about 30,000 homebuyers petitioning in the Supreme Court against the insolvency. In Binani Cement’s case, Birla group-owned UltraTech Cement and Dalmia Bharat have also approached the apex court challenging the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) order approval to select Dalmia Bharat as the final winner.

Meanwhile, employees like in the case of Alok Industries have filed an interlocutory application at the NCLT challenging the liquidation order.

According to Chatterjee, all situations cannot be plugged into the legislation. “There is something called what is the spirit of the legislation and what is written in the legislation. We have seen participants or stakeholders who have attempted to delay interfere and postpone…We worry about the governance issues (in Bhushan Steel), the resolution professional is doing his best but after all, he is not an industry professional. That’s a genuine concern. We want to see that the physical assets are in place.”

Besides Bhushan Steel, Tata Steel is fighting a legal battle with UK’s Liberty House over the bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel. The company had earlier shown interest in the debt-ridden Electrosteel Steels, but failed to win.

“We did not create more trouble when we lost out on Electrosteel...Value maximization can go on for years…From a longer term perspective, I don’t think there are concerns if it comes in the right form as we have seen it, Chatterjee added.

Among other cases, Essar Steel’s two bidders - ArcelorMittal and Numetal - are fighting eligibility cases at the NCLT bench, for lenders to approve any offer.",742,-0.9500087764528062

Strong volume growth in both the international and domestic business and an improvement in international steel prices helped Tata Steel close FY18 with a strong sales growth of 13.3 percent year-on-year (YoY) at Rs 133,016 crore.

Thanks to cost saving and internal efficiencies, the company’s overall earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 29.5 percent YoY at Rs 22,045 crore. With the Kalinganagar plant and international operations contributing to volumes, the management is upbeat about FY19.

Realisations and steel prices are much better compared to last year’s average, which makes the management even more confident of delivering better numbers. Stabilisation of Kalinganagar plant and cost savings in international operations would only add to its profitability.

In FY18, the biggest contribution was made by the domestic business which reported a 10.8 percent YoY growth in delivery volumes to 12.15 million tonne (MT), as against a 0.6 percent YoY growth reported by the European business, which accounts for 45 percent of the group’s turnover.

Due to higher realisation and cost optimisation at Kalinganagar plant, EBITDA per tonne for its domestic operation saw a 19.4 percent YoY growth at Rs 13,000 in FY18. Benefits were actually higher in the second half. For instance, domestic EBIDTA per tonne was around Rs 16,000 in Q4 FY18 indicating that FY19 should see the benefit of cost efficiency and better pricing.

In Europe, volume growth has been marginal because of slow demand growth and high contribution of imports. However, its European operation was able to deliver Q4 and FY18 sales growth of 6.3 percent YoY and 15.2 percent YoY, respectively.

The management is making all efforts to improve the product mix and rationalise cost. It launched 23 new products in Europe, part of which was caters to electric vehicles. With UK pension restructuring complete, operation issues will ease further.

Valuations

In FY18, its domestic operation fared well and will continue to drive overall growth because of higher volumes and better pricing environment in the domestic market. The management indicated that current realisations are better than H2 FY18 and benefits of the same will be seen in coming quarters.

In FY19, the company expects domestic volumes of about 12.5 MT as against 12.1 MT YoY. With the earnings momentum continuing and benefits of restructuring of the European business kicking in, the company appears well placed.

In terms of valuations, the stock at Rs 622 per share is trading at eight and six times its FY19e and FY20e earnings, respectively, is quite reasonable.

It would be worth tracking the progress of Tata Steel’s strategy with respect to the integration of Bhushan Steel for which it has recently received National Company Law Tribunal and Competition Commission of India’s approval. Bhushan Steel has 5.5 MT capacity and is currently operating at 3.5 MT.

Tata Steel Wednesday reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 14,688 crore for the March quarter, as against a loss of Rs 1,168 crore in the same quarter last year, benefiting from a one-time gain of Rs 11,376.14 crore from the restructuring of its UK business' pension scheme.

The Jamshedpur-based company's consolidated revenue from operations for the reporting quarter grew to Rs 36,132 crore, up from the Rs 35,304.89 crore reported last year.

The company's total expenses rose to Rs 32,626.42 crore, around 5 percent higher than in the corresponding quarter last year. Cost of raw material, which accounts for the lion's share of overall expenses, rose only 4 percent on year to Rs 10,369.77 crore.

Operating profit margin for the quarter was 14.53 percent, 215 basis points lower than the 16.68 percent reported last year. This was because expenses, despite having grown at a muted pace, rose faster than the company's operating income.

A Reuters poll estimated the consolidated net profit of the domestic steel-making behemoth at Rs 2,552 crore.

The steel maker's deliveries in the domestic market declined to 3.03 million tons for the quarter, as production was impacted due to an unforeseen blast furnace outage at its Kalinganagar plant. However, the issue has been resolved now and the plant is fully operational.

""Tata Steel performance has been robust in FY18 driven by our strong execution strategy and supported by favourable global demand-supply balance. During the year, our Indian operations delivered volume growth better than the market on the back of the ramp-up at our Kalinganagar plant and the strength of our marketing network and brand equity. Growth was broad-based across our marketing segments,"" said TV Narendran, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Tata Steel.

The bench comprising NCLT President Justice M M Kumar and S K Mohapatra also dismissed the plea of engineering and construction major L&T seeking higher priority in recovery of loan and imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh.

L&T, which is an operational creditor of Bhushan Steel, had sought higher priority in recovery of debt in the resolution process at par with the financial creditors.

The tribunal also rejected Bhushan Energy's plea to continue its power purchase agreement with Bhushan Steel. The order was pronounced in court today and detailed judgement is awaited.

Tata Steel is expected to swing back to profit in the fourth quarter ending March 2018, aided by better price realisation.

A Reuters poll of 10 analysts estimated the steelmaker to report a consolidated net profit of Rs 2,552 crore in the period ending March 31, 2018, as against a loss of Rs 1,168 crore a year earlier.

The company will announce its results on May 16.

The poll expects company’s consolidated revenue at Rs 34,869 crore as against Rs 33,896 crore a year earlier.

The company will be helped by a hike in steel prices, and also a correction in the rates of raw materials like iron ore coking coal.

These market conditions compensated for the trying conditions the company faced in its facilities.

Tata Steel’s production in India for the quarter was impacted by a breakdown in the blast furnace of its facility in Kalinganagar. Its domestic sales declined by 6.23 percent to 3.01 million tons, while production was down 4.06 percent at 3.07 million tons.

The performance was similar in its European unit, where sales dropped to 2.48 million tons, from 2.85 million tons a year earlier. Production was flat at 2.62 million tons.

The street will look out for the company’s outlook for the year, given its participation in the insolvency proceedings. While it has been declared the preferred resolution bidder in the case of Bhushan Steel, Tata Steel is up against a late bid by Liberty House in the auction of Bhushan Power & Steel.

In its European unit, the company had announced that it has begun to look for buyers for five of its non-core assets.

The company could provide guidance on the proposed merger of its European business with that of Thyssenkrupp. The merger has been delayed as of now.",299,0.06997218728065491

A day after it emerged that Tata Steel is facing resistance from employees of Bhushan Steel, a source close to the Singhal family has hit back at the Tata company.

Bhushan Steel is owned by the Delhi-based Singhal family.

The Tata company had out bid JSW Steel to emerge as the winner in the auction of Bhushan Steel. On March 22, it was declared as the successful resolution applicant by lenders of Bhushan Steel. But the final order from the National Company Law Tribunal is awaited.

Alleging that Tata Steel is trying to ""have proxy operations,"" the senior executive said, ""The Tata company has no role to play as of now. A wrong picture has been painted.""

The Economic Times had reported that Tata Steel was facing resistance in its efforts to get control over Bhushan's plant in Dhenkanal, Odisha. The report claimed that Tata Steel employees have been intimidated by those close the Singhal family.

""The transfer of power hasn't happened yet, and the process will start only once the NCLT order comes in... the present management has all the rights to visit the plant,"" said the senior executive.

He also took exception to claims that Bhushan Steel employees were given ""out-of-turn"" promotions. ""This is the appraisal season. In every company, employees have been given raises and hikes. This is normal,"" said the executive.

He reiterated that the resolution professional overseeing the auction continues to have control of the company. ""The senior management hasn't signed a single paper as of now,"" he claimed.

Tata Steel didn't respond to emails.

Protocol issues

The feud has brought forth the issue of who will control operations in the interim between the announcement of the winner, and the transfer of power.



""Technically speaking, the insolvency resolution professional’s time is up on the acceptance of the resolution plan,"" said Ran Chakrabarti, Partner at law firm IndusLaw.

""We are yet to see how quickly existing share capital can be recalled, cancelled and re-issued to the winner of the bid to put him firmly at the helm of the ship and practically reconstitute the board of directors.

In the interim, there’s always a risk of asset stripping and all kinds of other re-organisations, and we have to wait and see how quickly Tata Steel can exert practical control,"" added Chakrabarti.

Some experts have said that the transfer can take at least six months, and until then lenders and the resolution professional will run operations of the company.",413,-0.9746677160263062

Tata Steel is facing a twin-Bhushan problem.

One, it has moved the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) against National Company Law Tribunal's order asking lenders of Bhushan Power & Steel to consider a bid by Liberty House.

Even in the case of Bhushan Steel, which it has all but bagged under the insolvency process, Tata Steel is facing tough times. It is facing resistance from the employees of its acquired company. A story by Economic Times says that Bhushan Steel employees in the Odisha plant have resisted moves by Tata Steel to take over the facility.

Both the Bhushan companies belonged to the Delhi-based Singhal family.

Bhushan Power & Steel

Tata Steel had emerged as the clear leader in the race for Bhushan Power & Steel, after its bid emerged higher than that of JSW Steel, the only other company to take part in the auction.

But Liberty House joined the race as a late entrant and offered Rs 1,500 crore more to Bhushan Power & Steel's lenders, over Tata Steel's 17,000 crore.

The Tata company is clearly unhappy that a bid has been allowed past the deadline. The race is far from over, much to its charging.

When contacted by Moneycontrol, a Tata Steel representative said: ""No comments as the matter is sub-judice.""

Bhushan Power owes banks over Rs 48,000 crore.

Bhushan Steel

On March 22, Tata Steel was declared as the successful resolution applicant by lenders of Bhushan Steel.

The Tata company had out bid JSW Steel to emerge the winner in the auction of Bhushan Steel.

Experts say that transfer of control of the asset could take at least six months, and it is unclear who is responsible for running the company in the interim.

The interim period thus can be tricky for the buyer - here Tata Steel - as it takes steps to take over the assets.

The report indicated that officials of Tata Steel are being prevented from entering the Bhushan Steel plant located in Dhenkanal, in Odisha.

It hasn't helped that rumours bound of a possible job cut, making the plant employees jittery.

A lawyer, talking on conditions of anonymity, told Moneycontrol that it is the responsibility of the lenders and resolution applicant, who was overseeing the auction, to ensure a smooth handover of the asset.",394,-0.009115234017372131

Tata Steel has moved the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) challenging the order of NCLT, which had last month directed the CoC of debt ridden Bhushan Power & Steel to consider the bid of UK-based Liberty House.

Tata Steel petition is scheduled to be heard tomorrow before a NCLAT bench headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya.

It has challenged the April 23, 2018 order passed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which asked the lenders of Bhushan Power & Steel led by PNB, to consider the bid submitted by Liberty House.

Tata Steel was believed to be the highest bidder for BPSL. The committee of creditors (CoC) had not accepted the bid of Liberty House on account of late submission.

This was challenged by Liberty House before NCLT, which had allowed the plea and directed the committee of creditors to complete its resolution proceedings by June 23.

A two-member NCLT bench, headed by President Justice M M Kumar had said that Liberty House bid cannot be disqualified only on the ground of being submitted after the deadline of the resolution professional (RP).

""We hope that CoC takes an appropriate commercial decision as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC),"" NCLT had said.

The CoC had in February rejected Liberty House's bid to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel, leaving Tata Steel and JSW Steel in the race for taking over the assets of the bankrupt firm.

Liberty House had submitted before the NCLT that RP rejected its bid to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel without even opening the seal of its offer.

Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd was among the 12 non-performing assets the Reserve Bank had referred for insolvency proceedings in June last year.

Should it bid for Essar Steel, or Bhushan Steel? Or both?

Late last year, ArcelorMittal had submitted expression of interests for both the companies, which had been referred to the National Company Law Tribunal for insolvency proceedings after accumulating thousands of crores of rupees in debts.

But it wasn't until Aditya Mittal, President & CFO, ArcelorMittal, visited the Essar Steel facility in Hazira, Gujarat, in late 2017, that the company finally made up its mind. It was to be Essar Steel.

""Before I visited we were not sure whether we would bid for Essar or Bhushan, but on visiting it (Essar Steel) was clear to me that this was the most complementary asset for ArcelorMittal’s ambitions in India,"" Mittal told Moneycontrol.

""I was impressed when I visited Essar... It is a large, modern and well situated asset which we see great potential.

""I think we can add a lot of value to the asset which would benefit from our large international R&D budget, our extensive international experience across multiple steel products and our industry leading technology,"" said Mittal, whose father Lakshmi Mittal is the Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal.

The steel company is now locked in a battle with Numetal in the race for Essar Steel. On the other hand, Tata Steel is leading the race for Bhushan Steel, even as bankers are also considering a bid by Liberty House.

Later this week, both Numetal and ArcelorMittal are expected to get back to Essar Steel lenders, who had given the two bidders seven days to rework their resolution proposals.

Greenfield hurdles

In an earlier interview with Moneycontrol, Lakshmi Mittal had said that ArcelorMittal is focusing on Essar Steel to make its maiden manufacturing presence in India.

The company's planned greenfield projects in Jharkhand, Odisha and Karnataka have been non-starters.

""There are a number of well documented issues which have meant greenfield expansion in India is not straightforward even for domestic producers,"" said Aditya Mittal.

At the same time, he said the government wants to expand India's manufacturing presence.

""We have already seen the government introduce a number of important reforms, of which one is the IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code), and I would expect to see this continue and that will include delivering reform that supports much swifter execution of greenfield projects,"" said Aditya.

Similarities with Arcelor battle

Though the race for Essar Steel is far from over, many have already started making comparisons with Mittal Steel's battle with Arcelor in 2006. The battle had eventually led to the merger of the two companies, and creating the world's largest steelmaker.

""It’s difficult to compare any transaction. Our offer for Arcelor was an offer to shareholders of a stock-market listed company and we had to convince shareholders that ultimately there was more value in these two companies being together than continuing separately,"" recounted Aditya.

But wasn't it long and intense like that battle for Essar Steel is turning out to be?

""It was long and intense but ultimately everyone recognized that it was the right combination for the two companies and I believe that has been borne out over time,"" he added.

At the same time, Essar is different, added the 42-year-old.

""This is very different in that it is a process to acquire an asset that is bankrupt. Let’s do a compare and contrast when this process is over,"" said Aditya.",571,0.20278323888778688

UK-based Liberty House has offered over Rs 26,000 crore for acquiring the stressed assets of Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd (BPSL), leading Tata Steel and JSW in the race.

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has asked BPSL lenders, led by PNB, to consider the bid submitted by Liberty House for the debt-ridden company. It owes about Rs 45,000 crore to the lenders.

""In the meeting of Committee of Creditors (CoC) held today, the bid of Liberty House was opened. The consolidated bid amount offered by the UK-based firm for the stressed assets of BPSL was over Rs 26,000 crore,"" said a source privy to the development.

Tata Steel had earlier offered Rs 17,000 crore to the lenders as upfront amount and Rs 7,200 crore for operations of Bhushan.

JSW Steel made an offer of Rs 11,000 crore to the lenders and Rs 2,000 crore for the operations of the beleaguered power firm.

The CoC will meet again next week and take a call on the rebidding.

Allowing the plea of Liberty House, NCLT had earlier directed the CoC to complete its resolution proceedings by June 23.

The tribunal's order came over a petition filed by Liberty House, challenging the rejection of its bid by the BPSL's resolution professional (RP) on account of late submission. Liberty House had moved the NCLT on February 26 against the rejection.

The CoC had in February rejected Liberty House's bid to acquire BPSL, leaving Tata Steel and JSW Steel in the race.

Liberty House had submitted before the NCLT that RP rejected its bid to acquire BPSL without even opening the seal of its offer.

Bhushan Steel and Power was among the 12 non-performing accounts referred by the Reserve Bank for NCLT proceedings. The insolvency process was filed by SBI, the lead bank of the consortium of lenders, in the case of Bhushan Steel. A similar plea was filed by Punjab National Bank against Bhushan Power and Steel.",334,-0.6275061964988708

The Nifty ended Thursday 0.47 percent higher at 10,619. Session long consolidation around 10,550 levels followed by a sharp recovery in the last hour led to a Hammer candle on the daily chart. The candle pattern suggests Nifty may once again retest critical resistance placed around 10,640 levels.

The next leg of the upmove towards 10,670 levels is likely if and only if 10,640 gets taken out decisively. Downside supports are placed around 10,560 and 10,530 levels.

On the hourly chart, Nifty ended with a Flag pattern breakout, which implies its critical resistance placed around 10,640 levels may again be challenged. Downside supports are placed around 10,560 and 10,530 levels.

Nifty patterns on multiple timeframes show it ended the session with a Hammer candle on the daily chart, a positive. However, critical resistance of 10,640 has to be taken out on the upside for the next leg of the upmove to 10,670.

The Bank Nifty on Thursday ended 0.79 percent up at 25,010.90. Upside resistances are placed around 25,100 and 25,250 levels. Downside pivotal support is placed around 24,700 levels.

Based on thorough technical study, the research firm recommends Tata Steel which can deliver up to five percent return in the short-term:

Tata Steel: Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 600 | Stop loss: Rs 555 | Return: 5%

After reacting down from its recent high of Rs 624 per share, the stock is again approaching the long-term upward trendline support placed around Rs 570 levels. Based on above mentioned observations, we recommend a buy on Tata Steel for the short-term upside target of Rs 600 per share.

The Nifty50 which reclaimed its crucial psychological resistance level of 10,600 made a bullish candle on the daily charts on Thursday. The index took support at its 5-days exponential moving average (DEMA) for the third day in a row.

However, Nifty witnessed selling pressure around its crucial resistance level of 10630-10640. Hence, for bulls to regain control of D-Street, a close above 10640 is required which would open fresh target towards 10900 in May series, suggest experts.

Option data suggests an immediate trading range in between 10500 to 10700 and traders are advised to remain on the long side. Level of 10500 will act as crucial support for the index. Investors should keep a trailing stop loss below 10,530 for long positions.

On the option front, for the May series option data scattered at various strike prices since it’s the beginning of new series. Maximum Put OI is at 10500 followed by 10400 strikes while maximum Call OI is at 11000 followed by 10800 strikes.

Fresh Put writing was seen at 10500 and 10600 strikes while significant Call writing was seen at 11000 and 10700 strikes.

According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 10,575.54, followed by 10,533. If the index starts moving upward, key resistance levels to watch out are 10,644 and 10,670.

The Nifty Bank index closed at 25,010, up 196 points. The important Pivot level, which will act as crucial support for the index, is placed at 24,821, followed by 24,632. On the upside, key resistance levels are placed at 25,132, followed by 25,252.

The Nifty witnessed selling pressure post opening but managed to retrace about 50 percent of its intraday losses which made a ‘Hanging Man’ kind of pattern on the daily charts.

The market witnesses a significant selloff in the trading session just like we saw in Wednesday’s trading session but still manages to recoup some of the losses and closes below the opening level.

The index opened at 10612.40 which was similar to its intraday high of 10612.60. Bears pushed the index below 10600 to hit an intraday low of 10536 before closing at 10,570, down. The index closed below its 5-days exponential moving average (DEMA) placed at 10572.

Traders are advised to remain cautious ahead of F&O expiry on Thursday as there could be wild movements on either side. But, as long as 10500 holds, bulls have nothing to fear, for now.

India VIX moved up by 5.14 per cent at 12.50. On the options front, maximum Put OI is seen at 10500 followed by 10400 strikes while maximum Call OI is seen at 10700 then 10600 strikes.

According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 10,533.8, followed by 10,497.1. If the index starts moving upwards, key resistance levels to watch out are 10,609.9 and 10,649.3.

The Nifty Bank index closed at 24,814.4. The important Pivot level, which will act as crucial support for the index, is placed at 24,701.53, followed by 24588.67.

On the upside, key resistance levels are placed at 24,960.33, followed by 25,106.27.

German steel giant Thyssenkrupp expects its proposed joint venture with Tata Steel Europe to be finalised by the end of this calendar year, a senior company official said here today.

Both the companies in September last year had announced plans to combine their European operations and form an equal joint venture, creating Europe's second largest steel maker, after ArcelorMittal.

""The JV is an ongoing process. The talks with UK labour union are on and we expect closure by end of current calendar year,"" Jens Overrath, chairman of the executive board, Thyssenkrupp Electrical Steel told reporters here.

He was speaking on the sidelines of an event to inaugurate the expanded cold rolled grain oriented (CRGO) electrical steel unit at Nashik in Maharashtra.

The company plans to produce 35,000 million tonnes (mt) per annum of CRGO electrical steel used in transformers for power sector from the expanded factory, against the current capacity of 10,000 mt.

""India is a very important market for us and we are the only manufacturers of CRGO steel in the country. The expansion will enable us to enhance the innovative approach that we take towards all our products, thereby providing cutting edge technology to all our offerings,"" he said.

The country's demand for this specialised steel is estimated at 400,000 mt, which is being met by imports at present.

Overrath said the new product line set-up will help in meeting the continuously increasing demand of cold rolled grain oriented in the Indian market.

The company also hopes to shift its exports to Asia from European plants to the Nashik unit.

""We are also hopeful of commencing exports to Thailand, Indonesia and Sri Lanka from the Nashik facility,"" he added.",283,0.8388615449269613

With 12.48 million tonne (MT) production, Tata Steel India has recorded highest ever output for the fiscal 2017-18, mainly on the back of robust performance at Kalinganagar plant, according to a company official.

This represents nearly 7 per cent higher output compared to 11.68 MT the company had produced in the preceding financial year.

For the first time, Tata Steel achieved the landmark of 1 million tonnes of annual exports. It also registered the best automotive sales of 1.86 million tonne, the spokesperson added.

The entire value chain played a role in achieving these numbers but ramping up of its Kalinganagar plant was the most crucial factor to enable the company to achieve these milestones, according to the official.

At 25.39 million tonnes, the company's combined steel production from three geographies –India, Europe and South East Asia was up by 3.5 per cent in FY 2018 as compared to 24.52 MT in the previous fiscal, due to an improved performance in India and Europe operations.

After confirming its breakout from ‘downward sloping’ trend line channel, Nifty has seen a decent traction and precisely retested its previous swing high of 10,479.

Now, the daily RSI (14) is approaching towards 60 levels whereas the hourly chart signals multiple bearish divergences. On the weekly line chart, the previous bottom of 10,455 (weekly closing of February 9, 2018) may act as an immediate hurdle.

Any sustainable move above 10,500 will drive the index higher towards its crucial resistance of 10,630. On the flip side, 10,355 and 10,290 are near-term support for Nifty50.

The options data is indicating a rangebound move for Nifty in the short-term. The maximum call concentration is placed at 10,500 which indicates a stiff resistance whereas on the lower side, put writing was seen at 10,300 which will act a strong support zone for indices.

Overall, we expect Nifty50 will continue to consolidate in a broad range of 10,300-10,500 for the next few trading sessions before giving any fresh breakout on either side.

Here is a list of top three stocks which could give up to 9% return in the short term:

NIIT Technologies Ltd: Buy around Rs 912 – 903 | Target: Rs 1000 | Stop loss: Rs 860 | Timeframe: 15 to 21 sessions | Return 9%

Looking at the daily chart, the stock formed a strong base near Rs 860 and a Descending Triangle pattern. Recently, the stock confirmed its breakout from the said pattern and resumed its primary trend.

The daily ‘higher top higher bottom’ formation is intact and indicates that the primary trend is on the upside. Therefore, we recommend traders to accumulate this stock in the range of Rs 912 to Rs 903 with a price target of Rs 1000 and a stop loss placed below Rs 860.

Hero MotoCorp Ltd: Buy around Rs 3725 – 3700 | Target: Rs 4030 | Stop loss: Rs 3600| Timeframe: 15 to 21 trading sessions| Return: 7.6%

Looking at the daily chart, the stock consolidated in a range and has formed a triangle pattern. During the last week, the stock confirmed its breakout from said pattern.

Recently, it saw a pullback and retested the trend line of the triangle pattern. The daily RSI (14) precisely took support near 60 levels which is a bullish indication.

Thus, we advocate traders to buy this stock in the range of Rs 3725 – 3700 with a price target of Rs 4000. A stop loss should be placed below Rs 3600.

Tata Steel Ltd: Sell around Rs 603 – 608 | Target: Rs 550 | Stop loss: Rs 630 | Timeframe: 15 to 21 trading session | Return 8%

Tata Steel has seen a decent correction from its 52-week high and hit a low of Rs 553. Subsequently, it saw a decent pullback in the past few weeks and rebounded towards Rs 611.

Looking at the daily chart, Thursday’s high coincided with the downward sloping trend line drawn from the top of Rs 748. Another big factor which supports bearish bias is that the previous bottom of Rs 607 had reversed its role post-breakdown and is likely to act as a strong hurdle.

Hence, we advise traders to go short in a range of Rs 603 to Rs 608 with a price target of Rs 550. A stop loss should be placed above Rs 630.

India's Tata Steel would consider taking a majority stake in its planned European steel joint venture with Germany's Thyssenkrupp after the business has publicly listed, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

Tata's willingness to increase its holding is a sign of its commitment to expanding its steel empire globally, said the sources. This had been questioned by investors and analysts in recent years after the company, under former group boss Cyrus Mistry, put its British steel assets up for sale following years of losses.

Such a development in the planned joint venture - which would create Europe's second-largest steel group after ArcelorMittal - would also fit with Thyssenkrupp's strategy of reducing exposure to steelmaking to concentrate on manufacturing high-margin industrial and technology goods.

""They have different visions. Thyssenkrupp is looking to exit the steel sector while Tata is looking to stay and grow,"" said one of the sources.

Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp declined to comment.

The two companies struck a preliminary deal last year to merge their European steel assets into the 50:50 joint venture. Investors widely expect a flotation of the business, something that both companies have said could happen.

Tata Steel would ""down the road be open to taking over a larger piece of the pie"" in the Thyssenkrupp tie-up once the merged entity is publicly listed, the second source said.

The source added that this would depend on market conditions at the time of a listing and how well the company's operations were in doing in India.

Thyssenkrupp and Tata must retain a joint stake of at least 50.1 percent in the venture for at least six years following the deal's closing in the event of an IPO, according to a labour agreement between Thyssenkrupp and its workers seen by Reuters.

The deal does not specify how that stake should be split up, however, meaning Thyssenkrupp could in theory reduce its stake to, for example, 1 percent if Tata Steel agreed to take on the other 49.1 percent.

""We haven't addressed at all the question of an end, of a minimum (stake),"" Thyssenkrupp Chief Financial Officer Guido Kerkhoff told journalists in February when asked about whether both groups would equally divide the 50.1 percent stake.

Global steel equity values have more than doubled since hitting 12-year lows in early 2016 at the depth of the steel sector crisis.

Tata's push to expand reflects a broader global trend towards consolidation of a fragmented steelmaking industry. The biggest players, including industry leader ArcelorMittal, China's Hebei Iron and Steel Group (Hesteel) and India's JSW Steel are looking to snap up assets across the world as the market rebounds.

PATRIARCH POWER

Thyssenkrupp, an industrial firm as opposed to a pure steel player like the others, has long been open about its desire to sell out of steel. Both the Tata tie-up and last year's sale of its Brazilian steel mill CSA were done with a view to drastically lower Thyssenkrupp's exposure to steel and transform the group into a technology and industrials powerhouse.

Many investors have welcomed this strategy to slim down the sprawling industrial group to remove some of the conglomerate discount that they say weighs on the stock.

For Tata Steel, by contrast, the joint venture is a move to save its ailing European steel business, which has been burning through about $1 billion of cash a year, by getting better economies of scale.

Another major contrast between the two companies centres on ownership structure and corporate philosophy.

Tata Steel's holding company is Tata Sons, a $100 billion salt-to-software conglomerate which is 65 percent owned by Tata Trusts - public charities that have a major say in group decisions and have historically favoured the good of all stakeholders over shareholder returns.

In 2016, former Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry was ousted by family patriarch and Tata Trusts chairman Ratan Tata, in a dispute that involved competing corporate ethics and vision.

The octogenarian Tata was acquisitive, legacy driven and an exponent of the traditional Tata Trusts view that companies exist to provide value and service to a community, making profits as a by-product of that process.

Mistry, by contrast, was more focused on increasing shareholder returns, being nimble and cutting debt. He put Tata Steel's British assets up for sale in 2016 and even considered closing down the business.

Ratan Tata took issue with the move, even though the UK operation was losing 1 million pounds ($1.4 million) a day at the time.

The Indian equity market opened on a strong note on Thursday morning taking cues from global markets which ended on a robust note last evening. The Nifty jumped 127 points at 10,256 mark while the Sensex was up 373 points or 1.13 percent.

Nifty metal index out shined the other indices and was trading up by 2.34 percent led by Hindalco Industries which jumped 4 percent while Welspun Corp was up 3 percent followed by Tata Steel, SAIL, Jindal Steel & Power and JSW Steel.

Ahead of the MPC meet, Bank Nifty was trading higher by 1.12 percent led by Bank of Baroda, Bank of India and Canara Bank, each adding over 2 percent. These were followed by State Bank of India, Yes Bank and ICICI Bank.

According to Lakshmi Iyer, CIO- Debt & Head of Products at Kotak Mutual Fund, ""The upcoming MPC meeting holds significance in terms of the guidance the RBI has to offer. General market view is that of an extended pause. Market would also want to see the MPCs reaction to the recent axe in government borrowing program and its view on the fisc thereoff.

""Though our view is that of status quo, it would be interesting to see the MPCs accompanying stance in the light of moderation in CPI domestically and its reaction to the recent global developments.""

The top Nifty gainers included Hindalco Industries which jumped 4 percent followed by Indiabulls Housing Finance which added 3 percent while Vedanta, UPL and Tata Motors were the other gainers.

The most active Nifty stocks included Tata Steel and Tata Motors which gained 2.7 percent while Graphite India, Bandhan Bank and ICICI Bank were the other active stocks.

The top BSE gainers included Indiabulls Ventures which jumped close to 12 percent while Future Lifestyle was up close to 5 percent. Sterlite Tech, Jindal Steel & Power and Deepak Fertilizer were the other gainers.

Apollo Tyres, Interglobe Aviation, MRF, NELCO and Nestle India were some of the Nifty stocks which hit fresh 52-week high in today's trade while Gitanjali Gems hit new 52-week low.

The market breadth was in favour of the advances with 1435 stocks advancing while 184 declined and 401 remained unchanged. On the other hand, in the BSE, 1695 stocks advanced and 293 declined and 50 remained unchanged.

Global research firm, Morgan Stanley is of the view that with growth tracking in line and inflation tracking slightly below the RBI’s projections, it does not expect any changes to policy rates and stance at the upcoming meeting. Confidence on the growth outlook (and its impact on inflation) will be key to assess how the MPC’s stance will evolve thereafter.

Considering that the growth and inflation backdrop relative to the MPC’sassessment, the house expects the MPC to remain on hold and maintain its neutral stance. The vote for status quo would also likely be maintained at 5-1, with Dr Patra likely to reiterate his case for a 25bps rate hike, it added.

With no fresh new concerns over the inflation dynamic and with the recovery remaining in a nascent stage, we believe that the MPC will find merit in not takingup rate hikes at the upcoming meeting.

As regards the inflation outlook, the incoming data and our current assessment is that there are limited new upside risks arising from supply side drivers (relative to the last MPC meeting) while at the same time, demand pull pressures have not emerged in a meaningful manner considering the early stages of recovery. In this context, we believe that there is still time for the MPC to pause and assess more incoming data.",632,0.3334560924106174

Benchmarks traded on a volatile note and ended in red with cut of more than one percent taking cues from their key global counterparts that slipped on the back of increased fears of a full-scale global trade war. Selling during the second half pulled the markets lower with Nifty slipping by 125 points, while Sensex managed to hold 33,000 mark. The market breadth was in favour of declines with 3 stocks advancing against four declining ones.

Investors are also awaiting decision on monetary policy by Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The central bank is expected to keep monetary policy steady at its April meeting but shift to a hawkish stance by the end of this year and raise interest rates early in 2019 as inflation pressures build.

Technical Outlook

Nifty

Nifty snapped two day winning streak amid US-China trade worries. It opened higher but failed to hold gains and closed lower at 10128.40 Down 1.14 percent. It has formed 'Bearish Engulfing' pattern around supply zone indicating continuation of previous down move. Nifty failed to cross 'Upper Band' of Falling Channel i.e. 10260 levels decisively and reverted back to the channel. Now it has to close above 10260 levels for fresh up-move. We are expecting the Index to consolidate within a range.

Bank Nifty

Nifty Bank closed lower at 24129.50 down 381 points ahead of RBI policy due later today around 2.30 pm. It opened with positive note but failed to close above its short term moving average of 20 EMA i.e. 24465 marks which is suggesting downfall to continue in near term. Any significant breach below 24000 marks might drag Nifty Bank further lower.

Furthermore, on hourly scale, Index took hurdle around 50 percent Retracement level. We are expecting Index to consolidate within a range in near term.

Below are the top 5 stocks which can give up to 9% return in the near term:

Rural Electrification Corporation | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 134, stop loss: Rs 124 | Return: 5%

Balrampur Chini Mills | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 85, stop loss: Rs 74 | Return: 9%

Tata Steel | Rating: Sell | Target: Rs 542, stop loss: Rs 575 | Return: 3%

Dewan Housing Finance Corporation | Rating: Sell | Target: Rs 512, stop loss: Rs 528 | Return: 1%

The Nifty previous session ended 0.69 percent down at 10,113.70. Gap down opening amid overnight negative global cues followed by tiny range bound movement led to a bearish spinning top candle. Spinning top on daily chart implies indecision among traders ahead of long weekend.

However, prolonged critical support placed around 10,000 levels is intact. Hence, we do not recommend short selling at this juncture keeping in mind the Nifty prolonged support around 10,000 levels.

Also, RSI triple bottom formation on daily chart while Nifty downtrend being intact is pointing towards positive divergence. Downside pivotal supports are placed around 10,080 and 10,050.

On the Nifty hourly chart; huge positive divergence is seen in RSI and that may again take the index higher towards 10,210 and 10,250. Hence, buy on dips around critical supports is the strategy to be followed.

Nifty patterns on multiple time frames show, it rebounded from the prolonged upward trending channel support and ended with a bullish body candle on the weekly chart. Hence, Nifty is likely to see buying on dips around critical supports. Nifty challenging critical resistance placed around 10,250 is a bright possibility.

The Bank Nifty previous session ended 0.7 percent down at 24,263.35.15. It may once again challenge 200 daily EMA placed around 24,470 and likely to breakout.

Based on thorough technical study, we recommend following stocks which can give up to 5% return in the near short term:

Tata Steel | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 600, stop loss: Rs 555 | Return: 5%

After its recent correction from Rs 750 levels the stock is oscillating in the price band of Rs 555 to Rs 600. Midterm upward trend line support is placed around Rs 555 levels. On daily chart, the stock is trading in oversold zone. However, 600 may now act as the immediate pivotal resistance.

Based on the above mentioned observations, the research firm has recommended Tata Steel as a strong buy at current market price for the near-term upside target of Rs 600.

The Nifty previous Friday ended 1.15 percent down at 9998.05. Gap-down opening amid overnight negative global cues took the Benchmark Index down towards long-term upward trending channel support placed around 10,000 levels, day’s low was 9952.

However, recovery from day’s low led the Index towards ending the session with a bullish Doji candle. Hence, we certainly do not recommend short selling at this juncture keeping in mind the Nifty on daily chart continues making lower lows while RSI made double bottom and approaching towards oversold zone. Downside pivotal supports are placed around 9950, 9890, and 9860.

On the Nifty hourly chart; it already has reached extremely oversold zone while RSI shows huge positive divergence. Hence, we do not rule out the possibility of intraday buying on dips around 9890 and 9860.

Nifty patterns on multiple time frames show, bearish marubozu candle formation on the weekly chart may restrict the pullback around 10,020 and 10,050 even if intraday pullback comes in play on dips around 9890 and 9860 levels. Nifty getting stuck in the price range of 9860 to 10,050 is quite likely.

The Bank Nifty previous Friday ended 1.95 percent down at 23,670.40. It is approaching towards long-term pivotal support placed around 23,400.

The Ahmedabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal will on March 27 take up Numetal's plea to declare its bid for Essar Steel, eligible.

The VTB Capital-led consortium had on March 20 moved the Ahmedabad bench seeking a declaration that its bid for the stressed steel company is eligible.

It was an preemptive move.

A day later, on March 22, bids by Numetal, and ArcelorMittal - the other bidder in the Essar Steel auction - were rejected by the lenders after failing to clear the eligibility test. The lenders have further called for a second round of bidding, with April 2 as the deadline for submission of bids.

Despite the setback, Numetal would be hoping that the NCLT gives it a patient hearing. ""If the bench does take a decision in favour of Numetal, then the company could contest the eligibility decision by the lenders. Also, the decision to go for a second round of bidding will also be under scrutiny,"" said an executive from the industry.

Meanwhile, ArcelorMittal has got approval from exchanges to change its 'promoter' status in Uttam Galva Steels, giving it a boost ahead of the second round bidding for Essar Steel.

Exchanges have declassified ArcelorMittal as promoter of Uttam Galva.

According to a report earlier report in Moneycontrol, ArcelorMittal wrote to the exchanges and SEBI on March 9 to be declassified as a promoter in Uttam Galva. The NSE has approved the change on March 22 while BSE approved it a day later.

Second round

Second round of bidding may include five buyers who had expressed interest in the first round of bidding, including both Numetal and ArcelorMittal. All of them will be allowed to bid in the second round as well.

These include Tata Steel, Vedanta Group, SSG Capital, AION and Nippon Steel.

""A voting will be done among the lenders later this week to decide on allowing bids from companies who hadn't shows interest earlier,"" said a source.

Moneycontrol learned that JSW Steel will also be interested in putting in a bid in the second round. ""If the lenders decide against letting new companies joining the fray, then JSW Steel may join a consortium,"" said sources.

The test

Ever since the bids by ArcelorMittal and Numetal were first submitted, there have been doubts about their eligibility. This was because of an amendment in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), which prevented a promoter of a defaulting company from bidding for stressed assets.

ArcelorMittal had invested in Uttam Galva, which had defaulted on loan repayments. Though the Lakshmi Mittal later exited from the company, doubts persisted.

Similarly, Numetal's minority shareholder Rewant Ruia was termed a ""connected person,"" as his father Ravi Ruia is one of the co-founders of Essar Steel. Numetal is headed by Russia's VTB Capital, and TPE, an engineering major. Indo International Trading is a minority shareholder in Numetal.

Metals and mining giant Vedanta Ltd is unlikely to participate in the second round of bidding for debt-laden Essar Steel, according to a source.

Vedanta had submitted an Expression of Interest (EoI) for Essar Steel but did not bid for the bankrupt steel maker which owes over Rs 45,000 crore to its lenders.

The bids closed on February 12, 2018, with only ArcelorMittal and Numetal submitting resolution plans for the troubled Essar Steel.

There is a second chance for companies who had submitted EoIs as the SBI-led consortium of creditors this week rejected the bids submitted by ArcelorMittal and Numetal finding them ineligible under the IBC (Insolvency Bankruptcy Code) laws that debar related parties from bidding.

The CoC has, however, voted to allow a second round of bidding for the Essar Steel's nearly crippled 10-million tonne-asset at Hazira in Gujarat. The lenders have set April 2 as deadline for the second round.

""Vedanta is focussed on Electrosteel Steels. Had it been keen for Essar Steel, it would have submitted bid in the first round only,"" a source in the know of the matter said.

When contacted, a company spokesperson refused to comment on the matter.

Electrosteel Steel is another steel producer which is undergoing insolvency proceedings and has a loan exposure of over Rs 11,000 crore. Numetal and ArcelorMittal were the only two bidders for Essar Steel.

These companies had put in their bids but have been battling each other amidst questions about their very eligibility to bid.

Even though the Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal has teamed up with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp to bid for Essar Steel, it has been found ineligible for its joint venture with Uttam Galva, which is at the NCLT awaiting resolution.

As for Numetal's bid, one of the promoters of the special purpose vehicle SPV is Rewant Ruia, the son of an Essar Group promoter Ravi Ruia, one of the original promoters of Essar Steel.

Bankers, however, have said that if these companies delink their connections from the promoters or standardise their loans they can bid again in the second round.

Tata Steel announced Friday morning that it has been declared as the successful resolution applicant by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Bhushan Steel Limited (BSL), the stressed asset that was put for auction under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

The announcement could finally pull the curtains on a contentious auction, which saw employees of Bhushan Steel challenging a March 6 decision that had picked Tata Steel as the preferred buyer.

Tata Steel said it was informed by the CoC on March 22.

The latest announcement is subject to the Tata company obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, including approval from the NCLT and the Competition Commission of India.

""Tata Steel has accepted the Letter of Intent for BSL under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC),"" said the company.

First ok

On March 7, Tata Steel had announced that it had received a formal confirmation from the RP and that the company has been identified as the highest evaluated resolution applicant for Bhushan Steel.

But even as the company began talks with the RP and CoC on finalising the resolution plans, employees of Bhushan Steel approached the NCLT, which asked the lenders to consider their plea.

The CoC later met on March 20 to discuss the same.

The bears had an upper hand in Thursday’s trading session as they were successful in pushing the Nifty50 below its key short-term moving averages. The index closed 50 points lower at 10,360.

After defending the 200-DMA last week, the bulls showed some resilience and rebounded sharply during the initial part of the week.

However, the up move got restricted near its daily 45-EMA and we saw quick profit booking during the mid-part.

The daily 9, as well as 45 days exponential moving averages on price, is negative; hence, the immediate trend looks negative.

However, on a medium-term basis as long as the index is trading above 10033 which coincides with the weekly swing low and the weekly 45-EMA the overall trend is still up.

Going forward, Nifty has an immediate support near 10285 and if it sustains below this level will lead to a further correction towards 10210 and 10141 levels respectively.

On the other side, 10478 will act an immediate hurdle above which the index likely to rally towards 10630.

Here is a list of top buy or sell trading ideas which could give up to 18 percent return in the short term:

Analyst: Aditya Agarwal, Head Technical Research, Way2Wealth Brokers Pvt. Ltd.

Tata Steel: Sell around 615 – 620| Target 560| Stop Loss 648| Time frame 15 to 21 sessions| Return 8 percent

Looking at the daily chart, the stock has formed a Bearish Head & shoulder pattern and during last Friday, the stock confirmed its breakdown as it broke the neckline of the said pattern.

The daily RSI (14) convincingly broke the 40 levels. Recently, the stock had seen a pullback from its oversold zone, but the up move resisted near the neckline of said pattern.

Considering the above evidence, traders can go short in the range of 615 to 620 with a price target of 560 and a stop loss placed above 648.

Motherson Sumi: Sell around 315 – 318| Target 295| Stop loss 330| Time frame 15 to 21 trading sessions| Return 6 percent

Looking at the daily chart, the stock has been under tremendous pressure and nosedived sharply from its all-time high of 395.60. Subsequently, the stock found support near 301 and rebound from its oversold zone.

Traders are advised to go short in a range of 315 – 318 with a price target of 295 and Stop loss placed at 330 on a closing basis.

Divi’s Laboratories Ltd: Buy around 1075 – 1060| Target 1260| Stop loss 978| Timeframe 15 to 21 trading session| Return 16 percent

On the weekly chart, the stock has been consolidating a range of 1140 to 980 and the lower band of the range coincided with the multiple supports.

Recently, Davis lab saw strong buying interest and as a result, stock surpassed its weekly swing high. Looking at the weekly chart, the Bollinger band has compressed significantly indicating shift in volatility.

Traders are advised to buy this stock in a range of 1075 to 1060 with a price target of 1260. A stop loss should be placed below 978.

MAJESCO: Buy around 475- 470| Target 565| Stop loss 440| Time frame 15 to 21 trading session| Return 18 percent

After posting a fresh 52-weeks high of 604, the stock corrected gradually in past few weeks. However, the fall got arrested near 440, as this level coincided with its previous resistance zone.

In line with the expectation, stock saw a decent bounce from its support zone. The weekly RSI (14) has signaled an oversold position. Traders can accumulate this stock in a range of 475 to 470 with a price target of 565. A stop loss should be placed below 440.

Analyst: Hadrien Mendonca, Senior Technical Analyst, IIFL

Quick Heal Technologies Ltd: BUY| Target Rs 335| Stop Loss 320| Returns 9 percent

The stock has been under pressure for the past nine weeks and has finally broken out from a declining channel pattern on the daily chart.

The decline was arrested as it found support around its long-term 200-DMA. The price breakout has also been accompanied with a smart uptick in traded volumes.

In addition, Quick Heal has convincingly managed to hold above its short-term averages too. We expect the stock to make a dash towards its potential target of 335 levels in the medium term.

Future Retail: BUY| Target Rs 610| Stop Loss 538| Returns 11 percent

The stock has gone through constant selling pressure since hitting its all-time high of Rs 656 in November end 2017. The stock has been consolidating between a range of Rs 470-530 creating a Rectangular channel pattern.

The recent strong upmove has finally aided Future Retail to breakout from this channel. Volumes have also been accompanied the strong upmove. We expect the stock to move higher towards its potential target of Rs 610 in the medium term.

Eveready Industries Ltd: BUY| Target Rs 443| Stop Loss 395| Returns 8 percent

Six weeks of consolidation finally seems to be coming to an end as the stock has formed a Double Bottom formation and has staged a strong come back. The stock has witnessed a constant rise in traded volumes.

The recent move has also aided Eveready to move above the short-term moving averages. The stock has also witnessed a bullish Thee White Soldiers candlestick pattern on the daily chart further accentuating our bullish stance on the stock.

By Jaydeb DeyStewart & Mackertich Wealth Management Ltd.

The Nifty yesterday ended 0.15 percent down at 10,410.90. Recovery from day’s low towards ending the session above 10,370 led to end the session with a hammer candle on the daily chart. Our second support 10,330 acted as the spring board, day’s low was 10336.30. Ending the session with a hammer implies strength.

However, buying spree does not look strong enough to break through the critical resistance of Nifty 30 daily EMA placed around 10,480. Needless to say 10,330 may continue to serve as the major support on the downside. Critical resistance of 10,480 may play the spoilsport and may lead to a pause in the current bullish momentum. On the flip side, breaking out 10,480 may unfold fresh leg of up move.

On the Nifty hourly chart; session end recovery above 100 hourly EMA may once again take the Benchmark index towards 200 hourly EMA placed around 10,480. Midway resistance is placed around 10,440.

Nifty patterns on multiple time frames show, Nifty may face difficulty breaking out the resistance placed around 10,480. Position of critical moving averages coupled with leading technical oscillators suggests, Nifty range bound movement is likely to continue in the price band of 10,480 to 10,330.

The Bank Nifty previous day ended 0.46 percent up at 24,851.65. It reacted up sharply from the 200 daily EMA placed around 24,480, day’s low was 24,487.00. Upside critical resistance of 25,000 is still intact.

Based on thorough technical study, Stewart & Mackertich Wealth Management Ltd. recommends Tata Steel which can give up to 5% return in the short term:

Tata Steel | Rating: Sell | Target: Rs 598, stop loss: Rs 645 | Return: 5%

The stock is currently trading below the previous multi rebound zone placed around Rs 630. Since last few sessions, being oversold on the hourly chart, it continues osculation around 200 daily EMA placed around Rs 620 levels. Broader chart pattern suggests, weakness may persist long as it trades below the recent breakdown zone of Rs 630.

Trend following indicator MACD has already entered the bear zone coupled with –DI +DI bearish crossover on the daily chart, which suggests the stock is in a strong bear grip and may again face selling pressure on rise around Rs 630 levels.

Based on the above mentioned observations, the research firm has recommended Tata Steel as a strong sell on rise for the near-term downside target of 598.

Two of the high profile auctions under National Company Law Tribunal took a definite step towards culmination on Wednesday. While Tata Steel’s bid was formally identified as the “highest evaluated compliant resolution” for Bhushan Steel, Liberty House was chosen as the preferred H1 bidder for Amtek Auto.

In an announcement to BSE, Tata Steel said it has “received a formal communication from the resolution professional of Bhushan Steel that it has been identified as the highest evaluated compliant resolution applicant to acquire stake of BSL under the corporate insolvency resolution process, or CIRP, of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).”

This followed a meeting of Bhushan Steel’s Committee of Creditors (CoC) who took the decision in favour of the Tata group company, on March 6.

The company is now in talks with the resolution professional and the CoC on the final resolution plan for Bhushan Steel, which owes banks Rs 45,000 crore.

Tata Steel had emerged as the highest bidder for Bhushan Steel, with a bid of Rs 35,000 crore, with JSW Steel finishing second with a bid of Rs 29,700 crore.

Bhushan Steel has an annual production capacity of 5.6 million tons, and will add significantly to Tata Steel’s 13 million tons. This will make Tata Steel the largest steel maker in India, overtaking JSW Steel, at least for the time being.

The Sajjan Jindal-led company has a capacity of 18 million tons a year. It has emerged as the highest bidder for Monnet Ispat, which has a capacity of 1.5 million tons.

Both Tata Steel and JSW Steel are also in the race for Bhushan Power & Steel, which has a capacity of 3 million tons a year. Although Tata Steel’s bid has emerged as the highest, it faces competition from Liberty House, which has appealed to the NCLT that its bid, which was rejected, should be considered.

Liberty House’s maiden presence

With today’s development, Liberty House is poised to make its maiden manufacturing presence in India. The company is part of the USD 10 billion GFG Alliance and is owned by Sanjeev Gupta, a British industrialist of Indian origin.

“Liberty House, part of Sanjeev Gupta's global industrial group GFG Alliance, is set to make a dramatic entry into India after being chosen as preferred H1 bidder for Amtek Auto Pvt Ltd assets which include 35 automotive component plants across India, Japan, Thailand and Spain, employing some 6,000 people,” the company said in a statement.

The announcement of Liberty as the successful preferred bidder was made in the committee of creditors meeting held on March 6 and was confirmed by the resolution professional on March 7.

“This is a very proud moment for GFG and for my family. We are very excited about this opportunity to restore a great Indian business to its rightful position and add a major new asset portfolio to our international network,” said Gupta, Executive Chairman of GFG.

“This business will be the cornerstone of our strategy to bring GREENMETAL to India and expand our footprint in the automotive sector worldwide. We look forward to working closely with the high calibre customer base Amtek Auto enjoys. We are very pleased to be able to secure the jobs of 6000 workers and welcome them to the global GFG family,” he added.

Amtek Auto had accumulated loans of Rs 12,500 crore. Apart from Liberty House, American hedge fund Deccan Value had also bid for the company.

""Liberty team will now aim to meet with all the key customers and employees to thank them for their support to the business in these difficult times and ask them to partner in Liberty’s vision of achieving transformational turnaround,"" said Dr Douglas Dawson, Chief Executive of Liberty Industries Group.",631,0.9791462165968758

Though US President Donald Trump’s proposal to hike duties on steel imports may have little impact on the Indian steel industry immediately, there could be larger repercussions later on.

Some of the biggest exporters to the US could look for alternate markets, thus increasing the competition for Indian exports, which has been gaining volume.

In 2017, India turned a net exporter of steel after imports had dominated the trade balance since the middle of 2014. But that could come under pressure now as Indian exports find increasing competition if a trade war ensues.

Moreover, if exports come down, supply of steel in the domestic market may increase, putting pressure on prices.

On March 1, Trump said he plans to impose a 25 percent import duty on steel in a move to protect the American industry.

Indian steel doesn’t have much of a presence in the US. According to reports, anything between 2 to 5 per cent of Indian steel exports land up in the US market. Overall, India exported 4.9 million tons of steel in 2017, up from 1.8 million tons in 2016.

The growth in exports have continued in the present financial year. The outflow of steel products has increased by 53 per cent in the nine months till December 2017.

Much of India’s exports to the US consists of pipes and tubes. In fact, the US is the biggest market for these products from India. But these amount to less than 2 lakh tons a year.

According to an official from an industry body, Maharashtra Seamless and Jindal Saw are the major exporters.

“Already there is an anti-dumping duty on Indian steel products in the US. So the additional hike in duty wouldn’t have much of an impact,” said the official cited above.

Increasing competition

A bigger headache though would be the increasing competition in the overseas markets.

Three of the European countries – Italy, Belgium and Spain – are among the top 10 markets for Indian steel. Italy is the second largest market, after Vietnam.

Tata Steel, JSW Steel and Essar Steel are among the top exporters from India. JSW Steel had achieved its highest ever exports figures in the 2017 financial year. Tata Steel’s exports grew by 60 per cent in the second quarter of the present financial year.

At the same time, the US is a big export market for the European countries. According to reports, about 21 per cent of imports in the US origin from European countries. If Trump does hike the import duty, European exporters will come under pressure and may look for other markets, including those within the European Union. This will increase the competition for Indian exporters, and possible lead to price reduction.

Similarly, South Korea and Taiwan are significant exporters to the US. Again, they may look to divert some of their exports to the Asian market if the duty is hiked in the US.

“There will be increased supply in the Asian market, and prices could soften,” said an official from a private steel company in India.

This will be bad news for Indian companies who have been enjoying a pick-up in price and demand for steel in the domestic market. Steel demand growth had improved to 5.2 percent in the first nine months of the financial year. Also, there have been two upward revisions in prices this year.

But the trend may reverse in the coming months if Trump does prove that his threats are for real.",590,-0.2042960047721863

The race for Bhushan Power & Steel has just got longer, and possibly more competitive.

In a surprise for its competitors, Liberty House’s bid for Bhushan Power & Steel has got a fresh lease of life after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) today accepted an appeal against the rejection of its proposal.

The resolution professional (RP) and Committee of Creditors had last week rejected Liberty House’s bid for Bhushan Power as it was submitted after the deadline had passed, on February 8.

But the UK-based company had approached the NCLT on February 23, asking that its bid should be considered.

According to sources, Liberty House on Monday backed its appeal with a proposal to turnaround the operations of Bhushan Power & Steel. It also contended that its bid was higher than that of Tata Steel.

Till now, Tata Steel had been leading the race, with a bid of Rs 17,000 crore against JSW Steel’s Rs 13,500 crore.

Not surprisingly, Tata Steel’s counsel told the NCLT’s Principal Bench in Delhi – hearing the appeal – that Liberty House’s case should be dismissed prima facie. But the judge ruled that the Bench would like to hear in detail what each respondent has to say.

The Bench will now hear the three stakeholders – resolution professional, Liberty House and Tata Steel - on March 5, after asking them to file submissions through an affidavit.

“The matter is sub-judice,” a spokesperson of Liberty House told Moneycontrol.

“The Tribunal has heard us and heard the RP's counsel as well as Tata's counsel, who intervened. The Tribunal has deemed it fit that the respondents put their submissions on affidavit explaining conduct of the insolvency process. The parties will now be heard on the 5th. We are hopeful that our bona fide will stand out,” added the spokesperson.

Industry executives said the development was unprecedented and would have bearing on rest of the auctions. “This is surprising. Almost everyone expected Liberty’s appeal to be dismissed,” said an official from a steel company.

Bhushan Power & Steel had accumulated nearly Rs 50,000 crore in debts and was referred to the NCLT last year.

Apart from the Bhushan company, Liberty House is also in contention in the auction of Amtek Auto and ABG Shipyard.

Interestingly, the company – owned by billionaire businessman Sanjeev Gupta – had been a savior for Tata Steel in the UK. It had bought some of the facilities of the erstwhile Corus in the UK, reducing the debt burden of Tata Steel. The Indian company had acquired Corus in 2007.",436,-0.5540636777877808

The fate of Liberty House's bid for Bhushan Power and Steel may be decided on Monday morning, when its appeal to the National Company Law Tribunal will be heard.

The UK-based company had moved the NCLT after its bid for Bhushan Power and Steel was rejected by Committee of Creditors last week. The Committee, consisting of lenders, had refused to consider the bid as it was submitted after the deadline had passed on February 8.

The case will be heard by the NCLT's Principal Bench in New Delhi, and is listed sixth on the list of cases.

Tata Steel and JSW Steel had put in their bids on February 8, and the Tata company - with a bid of Rs 17,000 crore - is said to be the frontrunner. Bhushan Power and Steel has accumulated debts of nearly Rs 50,000 crore and was referred to the NCLT last year.

Unprecedented

The appeal by Liberty House, the USD 6.8 billion company owned by Sanjeev Gupta, is an unprecedented one. In none of the auctions till now has a bid been accepted after the deadline.

If the company's bid is accepted by the NCLT, it will open up a much contentious issue. Sources say that JSW Steel and Tata Steel may consider contesting it.

Last week, Liberty House had reacted sharply to its being rejected.

""Our bid was submitted before (other) bids were opened, so nothing unfair has happened,"" a spokesperson for Liberty House had told Moneycontrol.

""We will go to the NCLT and ask them to direct the RP (resolution professional) and CoC to open our bid. The process is not supposed to deny creditors to recover more money on these bad debts, that would not be fair as this is public money,"" said the spokesperson.

Apart from Bhushan Power, Liberty House has also submitted bids for Amtek Auto and ABG Shipyard.

In a conversation with Moneycontrol, Gupta had said that the sale of stressed assets in an opportunity to ""leapfrog"" Liberty House's presence in India.

Gupta, a British citizen of Indian origin, has transformed the company, which earlier was engaged in commodity trading, into a manufacturing major. The company has steel, energy and recycling facilities in the UK and Australia.",387,-0.3943714499473572

Tata Steel is seeking UK government backing for a 60-million-pound project at its Port Talbot steelworks in Wales, according to a media report today.

The project is aimed at overhauling a production line at Port Talbot to be able to make lighter steel for car-making, which is expected to secure the future of Britain's largest steel operation.

The Indian steel giant is believed to have informally requested financial support from the government to upgrade its Continuous Annealing Process Line (CAPL) to make lighter, thinner and stronger galvanised steels, the Sunday Times reported.

The move is aimed at meeting demands from the automotive sector, which is trying to slash the weight of cars to cut emissions.

Industry sources told the newspaper that UK taxpayer support for the CAPL upgrade was integral to Tata committing to reline an ageing blast furnace.

Without the extra investment, one of the two towering furnaces that convert iron ore into molten iron is due to finish operations by the end of next year.

Tata Steel is understood to be working on a plan to extend the furnace's life until about 2026. However, this plan falls short of a full relining, which would cost about 150 million pounds.

Maintaining Port Talbot's two furnaces is seen by workers' unions and the UK government as crucial to the survival of the plant, which has about 4,000 workers.

In September 2017, UK business secretary Greg Clark wrote to Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, asking for a ""specific commitment"" to the relining.

Chandrasekaran said overhauling the site would help ""develop the business viability"" for the reline — but fell short of a commitment.",295,
2018-02-23 14:13:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sanjeev-gupta-the-man-who-turned-headwinds-into-tailwinds-2514355.html,"In four days, Sanjeev Gupta has traveled from London to Sydney, and then to Mumbai. After spending a day in Mumbai, the billionaire entrepreneur will be again heading to London.

But Gupta insists he is traveling less compared to when he was running Liberty House’s commodity business. “I was taking 300 flights a year, most of them at nights. So I used to spend more nights in the air than on the ground,” says Gupta with a smile.

Those were the years after he had founded Liberty House in 1992 while studying at Trinity College in Cambridge. He was 13 when his industrialist father, based in Punjab, enrolled Gupta at a boarding school in Kent.

Now a British citizen, Gupta’s first big step from trading to manufacturing came in 2013, when he bought a loss-making steel facility in Wales. He turned around the operations and saved almost 200 jobs. It was a model he would master, successfully re-launching 25 businesses, including some of Tata Steel’s facilities in the UK. The British media hailed him as the ‘white knight.’

Gupta and his reputation travelled to Australia, where he has made multi-billion dollar investments. And now the 47-year-old is back home.

His Liberty House, now a $6.8 billion empire, wants to buy stressed assets in India in sectors such as steel, auto and recycling. Moneycontrol met him before his company's bid for Bhushan Power & Steel was disallowed. In a free-wheeling conversation, Gupta – who in between attended to messages on his Apple watch - talks about his business philosophy, plans for India and his management style.

Excerpts from the interview:

Your turnaround strategy is underlined by the focus on low-carbon technology. Can you please explain your business philosophy?

Our industries - metals and energy - have been and will continue to be critical for the evolution of mankind. The distress in these sectors is an opportunity for us. We are turning headwinds into tailwinds. We have turned from primary to green steel (using renewable energy to melt scrap into steel).

In the UK for example, we have started an arc furnace that Tata Steel had closed. It was restarted by Prince Charles. Two years ago he had asked, ‘What are you going to do differently? Can you do it when Tatas couldn’t do it?

Now, it is a great endorsement for us that we have reopened the facility. It was a very tough journey. Nobody believed in the model.

You also invested in downstream facilities.

We are the largest components maker in the UK, and we supply to clients in automotive and aerospace industries. In Australia, we plan to launch an electric vehicle.

And last year you set up a Foundation.

I’m excited about it. We will basically take kids, put them in industry and train them for the job market. Our intention is to get involved in secondary education. We are trying something similar in Australia also.

While you are keen to invest in India, the circumstances – including the economy - is at a different stage when compared to the UK and Australia. How do you adjust your strategy to this reality?

Actually, the shift is the same. In India too, we are dependent on fossil fuels for energy and the balance comes from renewables. And India is already leaps and bounds ahead of the world in solar pricing. India is very good in doing entrepreneurial stuff in small to medium size projects. Not mega projects.

We are not looking at solar. But what is exciting is waste energy. We have a new project in the UK, where we are using waste in environment friendly way. Once it succeeds, we will replicate in other markets. India has a growing waste problem.

How important an opportunity is the sale of stressed assets?

Stressed asset sales is important for us because it gives a quick entry. We could do organically, but the asset sale leap frogs our entry into India.

There are three-four sectors that we are focused on - recycling, steel, auto and then other sectors like real estate, construction, financial services. Here we are interested but not in any particular asset.

Are you concerned about the valuations?

If they go beyond a certain level, we will sit back. Everyone has to build their own model and see what works best for them. Some assets may be more synergetic for some companies. It's perfectly logical.

We won’t pursue everything at any price. There is a number at which we will sit back.

Would you say Tata Steel has overbid for Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Power & Steel?

I would not say that. You have to show them some respect. They are among the longest and the most successful business groups. So they know what they are doing. We shouldn’t second guess a company like that. It’s one of the greatest success stories of our time.

While you are interested in Bhushan Power & Steel, Amtek and ABG Shipyard, there is also a second list of defaulting companies that has been put out.

We have a plenty of targets in the second list.

Like Uttam Galva?

I won’t speculate. But some are obvious ones.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is new for India. There have been some issues. How do you see its impact till now?

It can be frustrating but I have some sympathy for it as it is the first time. It’s changing history, something which is a great transformation.

Given the dynamics of the Indian market, would you look for a partner?

We are Indian. I would never underestimate India, but it’s not like we are going to Russia or China. India is family. We don’t feel uncomfortable.

Do you have a war chest for investments in India?

Concept of war chest is an old one. Today there is no constraint on capital. We never had to take on any debt. We don’t have external shareholder at the moment. If we do end up doing something bigger, and we need capital, we have access to it.

Have all the stressed companies you bought turned around?

All of them are profitable. All of them are above water.

Now you have businesses across continents. You travel a lot. On what time clock is your body right now?

Somewhere in the air… I don’t know (Laughs).

I do travel. But less than I used to, to be fair. When I was running the commodities business, I was doing 300 flights, most of them at nights. So I spent more nights in the air, than ground. It's less now.

Earlier I was literally living out of my suitcase.

How much do you involve yourself in each of the businesses?

I don’t get involved in day to day management of business. I have a great team. They run the business. I have regular review meeting. What keeps me running is M&A. That needs more travel, its more hand-down.

How much time do you spend with family?

Family…less than I should and less than I want to.

One last question. Will you bid for Air India?

(Laughs). The short answer is no. But who knows. Aviation is a tough business. And you need some expertise in it. But you never know. We have got into sectors which I would have instinctively said no. But once you get into it and have a look, you realise you can make a difference. Something should happen to that business (Air India), that much I should say.",1249,0.23186254501342773

The benchmark indices extended the ongoing pessimism and the bears tried to break the recent swing low of 10,276 in early part of the week. However, bulls managed to defend this level and thereafter index eventually slipped into a consolidation.

Looking at the daily chart, we are taking slightly contra view on index and expect Nifty index to see a short-term pullback from current level. Till the time Nifty is trading above 10,033.35, the Higher Top Higher Bottom formation on weekly chart remains intact. On weekly charts, RSI (14), has signaled an oversold condition post the formation of a bearish divergence.

Also, on a weekly line chart, in the last two weeks Nifty precisely closed near its previous resistance zone of November 3, 2017. Hence, we are meticulously tracking Friday’s closing as any close near or above 10,450 indicates that the index is poised for a sharp bounce. In that case, we may see Nifty to rally towards 10,575 and 10,640 levels respectively.

On the flip side, the above hypothesis will be negated if Nifty breaks and closes below 10,276 in that case possibility of testing the swing low of 10,033.35 can’t be ruled out.

However, the expected pullback will be short term in nature and we don’t advise traders to go aggressive long in Nifty. Rollovers figure suggest that heavy short positions have got rolled in March series and the way March series future premium have reduced in yesterdays session clearly indicates that at higher levels markets will remain under selling pressure.

Here are the lists of 3 stocks which can return up to 12%

Coal India: Rating: Buy around Rs 310-307 | Target: Rs 338 | Stop loss: Rs 297 | Time frame | 15-21 sessions | Return: 8%

After sharp run-up from the bottom of around Rs 262, the stock rallied till Rs 311. Subsequently, it slipped into consolidation which led to a formation of triangle pattern. Recently, stock confirmed its breakout from the said triangle pattern.

The stock saw acceleration in volume activity that support our hypothesis. The weekly Higher Top Higher Bottom formation indicates the primary trend is up. Hence, we recommend traders to buy this stock in a range of Rs 310–307 with price target of Rs 338 and stop loss placed below Rs 297.

Hexaware Technologies: Buy around Rs 350-345 | Target: Rs 394 | Stop loss: Rs 323 | Time frame: 15-21 trading sessions | Return: 12%

Recently, the stock has seen sharp profit booking and corrected till Rs 323. Subsequently, it saw decent consolidation and post that stock resumed its trend. On a weekly chart, the RSI (14) has indicated oversold condition. The Higher Top Higher Bottom formation is still intact. Hence, we advocate traders to buy this stock in a range of Rs 350-345 with a price target of Rs 394. Stop loss should be kept below Rs 323.

Tata Steel: Sell around Rs 640-644 | Target: Rs 590 | Stop loss: Rs 665 | Time frame: 15-21 trading sessions

Looking at the daily chart, stock failed to surpass its previous swing high of Rs 748 and took sharp turn from Rs 720. In the process, the daily chart formed a bearish head & shoulder pattern on daily chart. Currently, the stock is trading near the neckline of the pattern however the hourly chart indicates the possibility of further correction. Hence, we advice traders to go short in this stock with a price target of Rs 590. Stop loss should be placed at Rs 665.

Reacting sharply to the rejection of its bid for Bhushan Steel & Power on Wednesday, Liberty House said it will approach the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) so that its proposal is considered.

""Our bid was submitted before (other) bids were opened, so nothing unfair has happened,"" a spokesperson for Liberty House told Moneycontrol.

The last date for submission for bids for the troubled steelmaker was February 8. Tata Steel and JSW Steel had submitted their bids, and the Tata company is said to be the front-runner.

Liberty House's bid came after the deadline, and is the reason why the Committee of Creditors - consisting of the lenders - rejected it.

The company spokesperson though said that while the 'creditors wanted to open our bid,' they were advised against it by the lawyers.

""We will go to the NCLT and ask them to direct the RP (resolution professional) and CoC to open our bid. The process is not supposed to deny creditors to recover more money on these bad debts, that would not be fair as this is public money,"" said the spokesperson.

Mahendra Khandelwal, the RP responsible for the auction, refused to comment.

""We are hopeful that the NCLT would clarify and our bid would be opened,"" said the Liberty House executive.

The technicalities

It is, however, not clear if the NCLT will directly consider a bid. According to lawyers Moneycontrol spoke to, the resolution professional is the one who admits bids, examines them and then forwards the proposals to the Committee of Creditors (CoC).

The CoC then engages directly with the bidders and aims to get the best possible deal. The final decision is taken by the NCLT, which also announces the result of the auction.

To invest $10 billion in India

For Liberty House and its Chairman Sanjeev Gupta, the auction of the stressed asset is an opportunity to leapfrog into the Indian market. Talking to Moneycontrol earlier, Gupta had mentioned that the company is keen to invest USD 6.8 billion in steel, auto and recycling sectors.

The spokesperson added that ""these assets are among the best in the world, they fit perfectly in our strategy for steel and for auto. If we are successful on BPSL and our other bids, we will set up the best steel and auto business in the world. This will include production of EV cars... the same model as we are doing it in Australia, UK and US.""

Apart from Bhushan Power & Steel, Liberty House is also interested in Amtek Auto and ABG Shipyard. Both the companies are being auctioned by the NCLT.

Since 2013, Gupta has bought and turned around 25 facilities in the UK and Australia.

""India should encourage entrepreneurs like us to invest in India. If we are successful in our bids we will invest $10 billion in India over the next five years,"" said the spokesperson.",497,0.4739219546318054

Tata Steel’s aggressive bid for Anglo-Dutch steel maker Corus Steel, over a decade ago, had surprised industry watchers at the time. Just when Tata Steel thought it had Corus in the bag, Brazil’s CSN Steel gatecrashed the party, and a fierce bidding ensued. Tata Steel eventually won what in hindsight turned out to be a pyrrhic victory.

Investment bankers associated with the negotiations said that the deal had almost become a prestige issue for Ratan Tata, then the Chairman of Tata Sons.

As Tata Steel now bids for distressed steel companies, buzz is that N Chandrasekaran, who completes completes a year as the Chairman of Tata Sons on Wednesday, is the architect of the strategy. The major difference this time around is that the aggression is far more measured, say analysts.

Maintaining a buy on Tata Steel's stock even after it emerged the front runner for Bhushan Steel (with bid of Rs 35,000 crore) and Bhushan Power & Steel (with a bid of about Rs 24,000 crore), Amit Dixit of Edelweiss Research said that the company is unlikely to suffer from the winner's curse.

""We believe, potential acquisition of these stressed assets makes strategic sense for TSL, despite the seemingly expensive valuation,"" Dixit said in a note. His belief rested on Tata Steel's access to raw materials and possible leadership in the high-margin auto steel segment (Bhushan Steel specialises in the product).

If Tata Steel does manage to bag both the Bhushan companies, its capacity will go up by about 8 million tons to 21 million tons a year. That will reinforce the company as the country's biggest steel maker, a crown that JSW Steel had recently wrested from it.

There is reason to believe that Chandrasekaran is deeply involved in Tata Steel's acquisition strategy. Last year, he had restructured the top deck of the company. TV Narendran, who was appointed the Managing Director for India and South East Asia markets in 2013, was elevated to CEO and MD globally. Narendran now reports directly to Chandrasekaran.

Corus puzzle

Under Chandrasekaran, Tata Steel has also taken definitive steps to reduce the burden of its European assets.

In September last year, Tata Steel and Germany's Thyssenkrupp agreed to merge their European businesses to create the continent's second largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal.

Recent reports quoted the German steelmaker as saying that the joint venture will be finalised by early 2018.

As much as Chandrasekaran will be keeping an eye on the developments in Europe, the Tata Sons Chairman would also keep a tab on Indian operations. The Kalinganagar facility, which at present manufactures 3 million tons of steel a year, will flag off the expansion of the next phase in April.

Once done, the company will manufacture 8 million tons of steel in Odisha. The new facility is said to be more cost effective than the one in Jamsedhpur, and the ramp up will help improve margins of the company.

Chandrasekaran would want to make sure that the timelines of the expansion are met, given the legacy of the project. The plant in Odisha was first planned in 2005, but work started only in 2010.",534,0.6733341117699941

Global research firm Credit Suisse has maintained an outperform rating on Tata Steel with a target of Rs 860. The house is of the view that the Bhushan Steel bid implies EV at 6x adjusted EBITDA adding that the valuation is not cheap, but with steel cycle picking up, the deal can be EPS accretive. The firm also said that minor working capital plus capex would be needed for the asset.

Macquarie has also maintained an outperform rating on Tata Steel with target of Rs 800. The house feels that the Bhushan Steel bid appears 10–15 percent higher than expectations and sees Bhushan assets as an attractive strategic fit.

The firm is of the view that assets offer growth optionality and attractive strategic fit while valuations need to evaluate factors beyond headline capacity.

""The stock correction on headline bid provides a buying opportunity,"" it added.

Tata Steel’s capital structure is set to change, which should help ease the burden of this transaction. A rights issue is under way to raise Rs12,800 crore and once the European steel business moves to a joint venture with Thyssenkrupp, the debt related to this business will also be lower. That should give Tata Steel breathing room for the increase in debt because of these acquisitions, a media report said.

At 10:23 hrs Tata Steel was quoting at Rs 645.00, down Rs 5.75, or 0.88 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 655.40 and an intraday low of Rs 642.50.",259,0.9999366283416748

Tata Steel MD and CEO TV Narendran on Monday emphasised the need to focus on harnessing emerging technologies by human resource professionals to drive a transformation within organisations.

In view of increasing volatility across markets, he said, the companies require nimbleness in tackling the storm of changes coming their way on a daily basis.

For the overall development of the Indian economy, it is very important that new businesses come in, he said at the 'CII National HR Excellence Award Recognises Exemplary HR Leaders'.

Narendran, however, said that new companies are also prone to the everyday changing atmosphere. The businesses are impacted by the multitude of changes, influencing the way a company operates, he said in his address.

""The human resource function must drive change and transformation within organisations by harnessing emerging technologies. With increasing volatility across markets and ever changing customer needs coupled with continuous technology-led disruptions to business models, an organisation's nimbleness and agility are what help it weather the storm of changes that hit it every day.

""This is where the HR function is expected to step in and seamlessly align the levers, leading to sustained industry leadership,"" Narendran told senior functionaries, representing the industry and the HR fraternity.

He also highlighted the critical role played by HR leaders in managing change and fostering sustainment.

The complexity and disruptions in the business environment today continuously decrease the visibility of businesses beyond a quarter, impeding organisations' ability to build long-term plans and requiring them to continually reinvent themselves.

Tata Steel has emerged as the highest bidder for Bhushan Steel with a surprise bid of Rs 35,000 crore. JSW Steel, which was the favourite till the end of the race, was second placed with a bid of Rs 29,700 crore.

A senior bank executive aware of the development confirmed the allotment to Tata Steel and the bid amount.

Bhushan Steel is one of the 12 large corporate accounts identified by the Reserve Bank of India that accounted for almost 25 percent of exposure to bad loans for the entire banking sector.

The Neeraj Singal-led company had accumulated debt of over Rs 50,000 crore, of which bank dues amounted to around Rs 44,000 crore.

“We are happy with bid offer and this is a good sign. We have provided over 50 percent. The haircut is about 35 percent,” the banker said.

An announcement may be made later tonight, or tomorrow, another source from the industry added.

The development follows a meeting between the lenders of Bhushan Steel and the resolution professional earlier in the day today. According to reports, the liquidation value of Bhushan Steel stood at Rs 15,000 crore.

Tata Steel and JSW Steel had submitted their bids on February 3. Initially, Tata Steel's bid was said to close to Rs 24,000 crore.

State Bank of India has one of the largest exposures to the debt-laden company at around Rs 6,000 crore, including external commercial borrowings. Other lenders include Canara Bank, Bank of India and Dena Bank.

In a consortium of 51 lenders, PNB is the lead banker for term loans to Bhushan Steel. SBI heads the consortium for working capital loans.

The company tried restructuring its debt under the RBI’s 5/25 refinancing scheme and S4A (Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets). However, after failure to make any headway, the central bank referred the case to be resolved under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

While a source in the industry confirmed the development, officials from Tata Steel were couldn't be reached. Calls to its corporate communication executive went unanswered.",353,0.3339069088300069

Bids for Essar Steel were to be submitted by 5pm on Monday.

Founded by Shashi and Ravi Ruia, Essar Steel was referred to the National Company Law Tribunal last year after accumulating nearly Rs 50,000 crore in debts.

“Essar provides a compelling opportunity for ArcelorMittal to enter the high growth Indian steel market,"" said Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO.

""The offer submitted today by AMIPL includes a detailed investment plan to address operational issues in Essar’s existing asset base. With our industry expertise and renowned operating prowess, we believe we are uniquely equipped to implement a successful turnaround which would be beneficial to Essar’s stakeholders,"" Mittal said in a statement.

His son and Group CFO and CEO, Aditya Mittal, added that “This opportunity aligns with the group’s strategy of selectively investing in attractive projects to maximize long-term shareholder value. India is expected to be the world’s fastest growing economy over the next decade and as the economy grows its steel intensity will also increase.""

Essar is the first company that ArcelorMittal has bid for, even though it had shown interest in others such as Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Power & Steel, which are also being auctioned.

Apart from ArcelorMittal, Tata Steel and Numetal Mauritius are also expected to put in their bids. Numetal is a special purpose vehicle in which the Ruias and Russian bank VTB are shareholders.

With Essar Steel being the last of the prized assets that are being put under the hammer, industry watchers expect the bids to be aggressive. While the liquidation value of Essar Steel has been pegged at Rs 20,000 crore, reports say that bids might be has high as Rs 40,000 crore.",299,0.999995231628418

The battle to gain control of the Essar Steel has boiled down to two contenders Lakshmi Mittal-led ArcelorMittal and Numetal Mauritius as the deadline to submit bid ends on Monday, according to a report in the Economic Times.

The other bidders in the fray so far include Tata Steel which is not likely to bid very aggressively, while Vedanta and JSW Steel are unlikely to submit binding offers leaving it a two-way fight between the two, the report said.

Rewant Ruia-led Numetal Mauritius is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) which has Russian Bank VTB as the largest shareholder with 40 percent stake and Ruias holding around 26 percent stake. The other partner in the SPV is Tyazprom Export (TPE) of Russia, a construction engineering and management consulting company which specialises in steelworks.

The report said that being a minority partner in the SPV will not violate the related party clauses of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Numetal is likely to have bid in the region of Rs 35,000-40,000 crore be more aggressive

Numetal is likely to offer an all-cash offer that could garner more attention from the lenders as they will get less cash component and need to take a haircut from other bidders.

The Russian government owns 60.9 percent in VTB Bank that arranged a facility agreement to provide up to USD 3.9 billion for refinancing debt at Essar Global Fund Ltd in preparation for the sale of Essar Oil.

Essar Steel was one of the 12 stressed account identified by the Reserve Bank of India last year to go for Insolvency and bankruptcy proceeding.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel (TATA) reported stronger than expected earnings on the back of higher margins in domestic operations. Margins in domestic operations rose to Rs14,000/t (PLe:Rs12,040) on the back of surprisingly lower RM cost. We increase our FY18e/FY19e EBITDA estimates by 6%/9% due to 8%/12% increase in EBITDA/t estimates of Indian operations. We remain extremely positive on the sector given the structural supply controls imposed by Chinese authorities and firm global demand. Positive restructuring of TATA Steel Europe (TSE) and increased focus on Indian operations with a goal to double the capacity (through organic and inorganic route) in next five years makes TATA one of the best candidate to play the strength in steel sector.

Outlook

We reiterate BUY with TP of Rs835, EV/EBITDA 7x FY20E.

Bids for troubled steelmaker Bhushan Steel will open today, marking the next round in the race that includes JSW Steel and Tata Steel. Employees of Bhushan Steel have also put in a bid and are reportedly backed by a private fund.

The bids, which were submitted on February 3, will be opened in Deloitte's Gurgaon office. Deloitte's Vijaykumar V Iyer is the IRP (insolvency resolution professional) for Bhushan Steel.

""The bids will be opened in front of the representatives of the bidders. And then the bids will be sent to the Committee of Creditors (CoC). We don't expect an official statement today,"" said an executive from one of the bidding companies.

Once the CoC admits the bids, the Committee will consider the resolution plans of the interested parties.

Tight race

Sources told Moneycontrol the bids range from Rs 28,000 crore to Rs 30,000 crore, twice Bhushan Steel's liquidation value of Rs 15,000 crore.

The company, which makes auto-grade steel and has facilities in Odisha, had accumulated debts of over Rs 50,000 crore, and was referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

The race is now said to be a tight one between JSW Steel and Tata Steel, after companies such as ArcelorMittal, Liberty House and SAIL - who had expressed their interest -didn't put in a bid. Anil Agarwal's Vedanta was also said to be interested in buying Bhushan Steel but was not clear if it has put in a bid or not.

The much-tracked auction of Bhushan Steel saw a flurry of activity as the bid deadline got over at 6pm on Saturday, February 3.

JSW Steel, Tata Steel and a consortium of Bhushan Steel's employees, possibly backed by a Singapore-based fund, have put in bids for the troubled steel maker.

The company, which had accumulated debt of over Rs 50,000 crore, had been put up for auction by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The bids were submitted on Saturday at the Gurgaon office of Deloitte, whose Vijaykumar V Iyer is the IRP (insolvency resolution professional) for Bhushan Steel.

It is learnt that other companies such as ArcelorMittal, UK-based Liberty House and Steel Authority of India, who had earlier submitted expressions of interest, did not submit bids for the company. ""The company hasn't submitted a bid,"" said a source close to Liberty House, owned by NRI billionaire Sanjeev Gupta.

The bids will now be opened on Tuesday.

While the exact bid amounts couldn't be ascertained, it is believed to be around the Rs 28,000-30,000 crore mark. That is nearly twice the liquidation value of Rs 15,000 crore. The race, say executives, is a close one, and JSW Steel might just have its nose ahead in the race.

The bid by Bhushan Steel’s staff is backed by 400 of the company's employees. ""This includes employees from across the organization, including the plants, and also from across hierarchy,"" a senior official from the company told Moneycontrol. The identity of the fund, which is backing the employees, couldn't be ascertained.

Bhushan Steel, which has a steel facility and mining lease in Odisha, had accumulated debt of nearly Rs 50,000 crore.

Controversy

Although the bidding process generated a lot of interest, it wasn’t without its share of controversy. Some of the bidders alleged that ArcelorMittal placed its bid after the 6pm deadline on Saturday.

""According to the rules, this is not possible,"" said a senior executive from a company that's in the race. One bidder even planned to lodge a protest with Deloitte on Monday.

But by late evening on Sunday, ArcelorMittal said it had not bid for Bhushan Steel.

""ArcelorMittal can confirm it has not bid for Bhushan steel, but we remain interested at looking at future opportunities in India,"" a company representative told Moneycontrol in an emailed statement.

Tata Steel today said it has commissioned a Solid Liquid Separation (SLS) plant for Gas Cleaning Plant (GCP) slurry at its Ferro Alloys Plant (FAP) at Joda in Keonjhar district of Odisha.

This is the first such plant in the country in the ferro-alloys sector, the company said.

The SLS plant, besides conserving water, would prevent water from sludge pits percolating into the ground and contaminating ground water, Rajeev Singhal, Vice President, (Raw Materials) of Tata Steel said in a statement.

As a responsible corporate, Tata Steel had been undertaking several such initiatives that contributed towards sustainability of the environment, said Singhal, who inaugurated the SLS plant yesterday.

Installed at a cost of nearly Rs 8 crore at FAP, Joda the SLS plant is an environment-friendly initiative, set to recover manganese-rich solid from the wet gas cleaning plant slurry.

Water recovered by the processing of GCP slurry will be fully recycled, leading to water conservation to the tune of 15 cubic metre per hour, the company statement said.

Also, the recovery of manganese-rich solids makes it possible to recycle the same, for production of Ferro Manganese.

Manganese-rich solid cakes from the new SLS plant will be used for production of Ferro Manganese after suitable agglomeration, it said.

FAP-Joda, set up in 1958 with an installed capacity 36 KMT, presently produces 50 KMT of High Carbon Ferro Manganese per annum.",241,

Narendran also hoped that in the forthcoming Union budget the government would spend more on infrastructure.

""If you invest in infrastructure, the demand for steel goes up. You cannot build infrastructure without steel,"" he said.

He was speaking during an informal chat on the sidelines of Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet 2018 here yesterday.

""If government invests more and more in infrastructure or intends to do so, it is good for the industry,"" he said when asked about the forthcoming budget.

In an industry, where most players are operating at about 50-55 percent capacity utilisations, companies like Tata Sponge stand out with almost 110 percent capacity utilisation. While addressing analysts conference call, management highlighted the industry is going through difficulties as a result of low availability of the iron ore and higher coal prices leading to overall very low level of production. This comes at a time when sponge iron, used in making steel, is in higher demand as a result of robust prospects of the steel industry.

Tata Sponge has been able to capitalise on this trend thanks to the support from Tata Steel, parent company, for the supply of iron ore and its proximity to iron ore belt and ports.

Strong quarter

Higher demand and better pricing environment is helping the company to report good sales growth. During the quarter ended December 2017, company reported realisations of close to Rs 17,300 per tonne leading to strong 50.3 percent increase in sales to Rs 215 crore.

The benefits of operating leverage and the fact that the company was able to pass on the hike in raw material prices led to strong growth in earnings. During the quarter ended December 2017, the company reported strong 22 percent operating margins as against 8 percent in the year-ago quarter.

In fact, there was a three-fold increase in profit to Rs 36 crore as against 11 crore last year despite hike in raw material prices. During the quarter the company’s coal cost increased to Rs 8,198 per tonne as against Rs 6,757 per tonne in the year ago period. Similarly, iron ore prices also moved up marginally from Rs 2,196 per tonne to Rs 2,257 per tonne.

Sting on huge cash

Currently sponge iron prices are trading at about Rs 20,000 per tonne and management believes it will remain firm given the demand-supply situation. This is also a reason for earnings growth to remain strong over the next two quarters with good cash flow generation.

Beyond that, considering the company is operating at full capacity, there is not much leeway to improve profits other than improvement in realisations, till the time new capacities are added.

As of now, the company is still evaluating its 1.5 million tonne steel capacity addition plans, as a part of forward integration. The management said it will take about 2.5 years from the time the company gets environment clearances. Meanwhile, the company is also contemplating participation in government’s upcoming auction of iron ore mines, which could be positive and help in utilising the cash in the books.

Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha today urged Tata Steel and associated companies to make use of drones to solve urban problems.

Addressing a gathering as the chief guest in the 'City Data For India Conclave 2018 - Smart City Initiatives' organized jointly by Tata Steel, Tata Trust, Jusco and CII at JRD Tata sports complex here, Sinha said drones are the next big thing as its applications are extraordinary.

Drones have varied applications in delivery, transportation, security/surveillance, he said and added that Tata Steel should work on it and develop it as a future industry like it did while setting up the steel plant here.

""Drone technology can be utilized to solve many problems and Tata Steel should work on it and start implementing it from their hometown here before following it up in other parts of the state and country,"" Sinha said.

Referring to the steep fall in airfare, which was as low as the fare of an autorickshaw per kilometre, Sinha said the cost of air ticket from Ranchi to Delhi, or Delhi to Mumbai is almost equal to the fare of an autorickshaw at Rs 4-5 per km.

Sinha said Tata Steel and Tata Motors have an efficient management structure and efficient engineers and asked them to figure out whether E-rickshaw with drone technology can be operated in an urban environment.

Sinha assured that the government was ready to partner with the Tatas in this regard.

Later, addressing a press conference, he said the government was preparing a draft on drone regulation.

Goldman Sachs has initiated Neutral call on Tata Steel as it feels positives have been fairly priced in.

The global research house has set a target price of Rs 780 for the stock, implying a 7 percent potential upside from Tuesday's closing price.

According to the research house, Tata Steel's Phase 1 of Kalinganagar plant is expected to drive near-term volume growth.

Its India profitability is expected to be impacted by narrowing spreads, but European profitability is expected to remain stable over medium term, Goldman feels.

""We don’t take view on European JV deal materializing and estimates don't incorporate European JV,"" it said.

The research house expects volume/EBITDA/net profit to grow at a CAGR of 6/10/21 percent over FY17-20, and Return on equity/return on capital employed to expand to 17/8 percent by FY20 versus 10/5.7 percent in FY17.

Tata Steel today expressed hope that the new year is expected to be slightly better compared to the last two years as stability has returned to the steel sector globally.

Addressing a gathering on the new year, TV Narendran, CEO and Managing Director of Tata Steel said 2017 was somewhat better compared to the preceding two years despite challenges.

In 2014, he said, Tata Steel had dealt with some of the challenges relating to the closure of its mines because of change in regulations, while in 2015 China had increased its export volumes globally, including India, which created a challenging atmosphere.

However, Tata Steel continued to perform and grew during this period despite the odds, he said.

""Despite these challenges in the last two years, Tata Steel has continued to invest and has grown not only in the works but also in the township of Jamshedpur to improve facilities during this period,"" Narendran said.

Recently, he said, the Tata Group Chairman and Board members had visited Jamshedpur and they were ""quite happy"" with what they saw.

Emphasizing on the need for competitiveness, he said that going forward, the competitiveness of Jamshedpur plant will get challenged after 2030 when the mines it has at its disposal today would be put up for auction.

Later, talking to reporters, Narendran said there is a stability in the steel sector globally and import of steel from China has come down to five million tonnes from 10 million tonnes because of anti-dumping duty and other temporary measures taken by the government.

Referring to the Kalinganagar project in Odisha, Narendran said the board has given green signal to start the second phase of work there, which has achieved 100 percent production level within a year of commission.

Describing the government’s action as positive in view of demand, he said the consumption of steel would increase with infrastructure development in the country and also the logistics cost, which was currently on the higher side compared to other countries, would come down with improvement in infrastructure.

On completion of three years by the Raghubar Das-led government in Jharkhand, Narendran said the government was successful in creating a name for the mineral-rich state during the period.",369,0.4115028142929077

The successful roll out of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) also had positive implications across the company's value chain in India, T V Narendran, CEO and Managing Director of Tata Steel, said in a message to employees on the last day of the year.

“2017 saw a recovery in global steel demand, prices and trade leading to better-than-expected performance by India’s steel sector. The year not only saw India becoming the third largest steel producer in the world, it managed to successfully reverse the trend of increasing imports as it became a net exporter,"" he said.

He added that the Centre's National Steel Policy 2017 has drawn the long-term road map for steel vision in India.

""In Tata Steel, we are committed to further growing our business in India and we look forward to working closely with the government contributing positively to India’s economic growth,"" Narendran said.

Tata Steel is ramping up production at its Khondbond iron ore mine in Odisha to fuel expansion of the Kalinganagar plant, a company official said.

However, the requirement for coking coal will be met through imports and the company will keep looking for opportunities to bid for fresh leases of coking coal, the official who requested not to be quoted, said.

Last week, Tata Steel Board decided to expand the capacity of Kalinganagar plant in Odisha by 5 million tonne per annum (MTPA) to 8 MTPA with an investment of Rs 23,500 crore.

When asked how the company will manage the increased supply of raw materials to boost production, the official said: ""Tata Steel has been self sufficient as far as iron ore is concerned.""

He further said investment of Rs 2,000-2,500 crore is being done in the Khondbond mine that will supply iron ore to Kalinganagar steel unit.

Iron ore and coking coal are the two key raw materials for crude steel production.

On supply of the other raw material, he said the requirement of coking coal will be met through imports.

Workers on Thursday struck a deal with German industrial company Thyssenkrupp to secure steel plants and jobs, a big step towards a planned merger of the group's European steel business with that of India's Tata Steel.

The deal removes a major obstacle to the merger, planned for next year, which will create Europe's second-largest steel group after ArcelorMittal and continue Thyssenkrupp's efforts to transform itself into a more technology-focused company.

The workers' approval for the deal, first announced in September, is seen as key to getting the deal done and shows Thyssenkrupp's commitment to seek workers' consent for far-reaching structural changes.

""The outcome achieved today represents a key prerequisite for meeting our strategic objectives and at the same time satisfying the interests of our employees,"" Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger said in a statement.

The agreement, which still needs to be approved by the members of IG Metall, Germany's most powerful union, foresees no forced layoffs or major site closures until Sept. 30, 2026, labour representatives and the group said.

This comes close to the union's demands for 10 years, which were made in response to concerns that Thyssenkrupp might be shirking responsibility for its volatile steel unit, whose roots go back more than 200 years, by merging it with a rival.

Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel in September reached a preliminary agreement to merge their European steel units to create the continent's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal, with 15 billion euros ($17.81 billion) of sales.

They said the deal will help them to tackle overcapacity in Europe's steel market, which faces cheap imports, subdued construction demand and inefficient legacy plants. The companies have already announced 4,000 job cuts as part of the tie-up.

Under Thursday's labour deal, Thyssenkrupp said it would keep a stake in the joint venture for at least six years. It said a change in the entity's shareholder structure during that time, possibly as the result of a stock market listing, could not be ruled out.

""That means that Thyssenkrupp management will share responsibility for either the success or the failure of a possible joint venture,"" Detlef Wetzel, deputy supervisory board chairman of Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe, told Reuters.

Thyssenkrupp, which also said it would invest at least 400 million euros a year at its German steel sites, still needs to get the joint venture deal through its supervisory board before a final contract can be signed in 2018.",412,-0.0818948894739151

The board also reviewed the financial strategy of the company in the light of organic and inorganic growth strategy of the company and approved financial plan to raise capital for the plan.

""The Board approved issuance of equity and equity linked instruments including ordinary shares of the company by way of a rights issue to existing shareholders on record date for an amount not exceeding Rs 12,800 crore...,"" the statement said.

Tata Steel said that following the successful implementation of the phase 1 of the Kalinganagar Project in Odisha, ""the board approved the next phase of expansion of capacity in Kalinganagar by 5 MTPA from 3 MTPA to 8 MTPA (million tonne per annum)"".

Thyssenkrupp is prepared to offer workers commitments on jobs and investments to get union backing for its deal with Tata Steel to merge their European steel operations, German weekly Bild am Sonntag reported, citing an internal memo.

""We are prepared to make wide-ranging commitments on the topics that are most important to our employees,"" the paper quoted Thyssenkrupp personnel chief Oliver Burkhard as telling managers in the memo.

""That concerns for instance securing sites, future investments and job security. With our proposal, we want to secure jobs at the future joint venture into the next decade,"" he said.

German labour union IG Metall had given Thyssenkrupp until Dec. 22 to agree guarantees on jobs, plants and investments, putting further pressure on Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger, who has said he wants the approval of shop stewards for the merger plan.

Hiesinger hopes to reach a final deal with Tata Steel in early 2018 but that depends on whether he can get it passed by Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board, where workers' representatives have called for jobs and plants to be secure for 10 years.

JM Financial's research report on Tata Steel

Tata Steel reported consolidated EBITDA of INR47.2bn in-line with JMfe. While Indian operations reported an EBITDA in line with estimates, European operations delivered an EBITDA of USD45/ton vs. JMFe of USD73/ton, driven by higher RM costs and lower spreads. Tata’s Indian operations have now fully ramped up, with its 3mt green-field steel plant at Kalinganagar operating at close to full utilisation levels. A barrage of duties put in place by the Government has ensured a floor price for imports, limiting any downside to Indian operations profitability. We expect continued focus on the EU turnaround plans for much of the current fiscal year. We factor in Indian operations EBITDA/ton of INR11.3/11.5k for FY18/19E and an EBITDA/ton of USD75 for European business.

Outlook

We escribe a multiple of 7x FY19 EV/EBITDA to Indian business to arrive at SOTP fair value of INR750/sh. Maintain BUY.
