HDFC Bank's stock will remain in focus on October 4 as the bank restructures its top management post a merger with HDFC Ltd in July. This is the second reorganization since Sashidhar Jagdishan took over as managing director and chief executive officer in October 2020, succeeding Aditya Puri.

The bank communicated the changes in a memo to employees on October 1, as per reports. Information technology and digital functions, led by Ramesh Lakshminarayanan, now report directly to CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan as the bank emphasizes on technology for expanded services. Ashish Parthasarthy, a veteran of the bank, will oversee the crucial retail branch business, including deposits and product distribution.

Parthasarthy is restructuring the retail branch business geographically for better expansion and product management. Smita Bhagat and Sampath Kumar will co-lead this effort. Bhagat, a senior leader at the bank, handled government, institutional, ecosystem, inclusive banking, and start-ups. Kumar managed liability products, third-party products, and non-resident business, CNBCTV18 reported.

""This may aim to enhance execution to (1) drive growth in mortgages, where Mr. Arvind Kapil will get exclusive charge and (2) optimise branch ramp-up where responsibilities will be split geographically. IT & Digital also get a needed direct reporting to CEO. Ramp-up of deposits & housing book will be key to growth & investor comfort"", said Jefferies India in its latest note. The brokerage house stayed its buy rating on the stock and increased its target price to Rs 2030 a share, up 33 percent from current market price.

HDFC Bank's stock has declined by over 9 percent in the past three weeks following the takeover of HDFC Ltd. However, analysts consider it to be trading at attractive valuations (2.1x Mar’25E ABV and ~13x EPS) and believe it offers a favorable risk-reward for long-term investors. They anticipate that as growth and earnings gradually recover, the stock's performance will improve.

The stock closed at Rs 1508.05 on the NSE on October 3.

Meanwhile, post merger, analysts expects HDFC Bank to experience a near-term decline in net interest margin (NIM), net worth, and asset quality after merging with parent company HDFC. HDFC Bank's CFO Srinivasan Vaidyanathan noted a potential 25 basis point NIM contraction due to increased CRR and excess liquidity post-merger.

This could result in lower earnings for the bank in the second quarter, with the merged entity's margin estimated at 3.7-3.8 percent in June, down from the bank's previous standalone margin of 4.1 percent. Analysts, including Macquarie, suggest this may affect the bank's near-term return on assets (RoA).

""HDFC Bank is not going to rally in a hurry and there will be more of a selling pressure. Some of the technical indicators are in the oversold territory.. the stock is very close to its support zone of Rs 1470-1500. This is the zone where it could see some respite. But sustaining these levels will be difficult. If it does bounce back, it will meet with immediate resistance of Rs 1560-1600 levels"", said Aamar Deo Singh, AngelOne.",560,-0.1423151237624032

HDFC Bank Ltd. is revamping some parts of top management as the Indian bank seeks to propel its mortgages business, three months after it acquired another lender.

The bank detailed the changes in a memo to employees late Sunday, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.

It has brought information technology and digital functions, led by Ramesh Lakshminarayanan directly under Chief Executive Officer Sashidhar Jagdishan as the bank leans on technology to offer more products and services across its branches, the people said. Ashish Parthasarthy a bank veteran who has led treasury since 2009, will get responsibility for the key retail branch business, which handles deposits and product distribution, they added.

The lender’s shares have come under pressure since the takeover of Housing Development Finance Corp. in July, which made HDFC one of the world’s largest banks. It also faced a rare downgrade last month from Nomura Holdings Inc., which cited concerns on HDFC’s return on assets and pressures on loan growth.

HDFC Bank Shares Have Trailed Private Lenders in India.

HDFC agreed last April to acquire the country’s largest mortgage lender in a deal valued at about $60 billion to ride a boom in home loans and consumer spending in the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The deal to merge the two companies with a combined market value of almost $190 billion at that time followed a proposal by the banking regulator for large non-banking finance companies to convert into banks to avoid a repetition of the nation’s massive shadow lending crisis in 2018.

Under Parthasarthy, the lender is splitting the geographical management of the retail branch business to handle its expansion and product plans in a more structured way, the people said. It will be co-led by Smita Bhagat and Sampath Kumar.

Bhagat, one of the senior women leaders at the bank, was previously the group head for government and institutional business, ecosystem banking, inclusive banking and start-ups. Kumar was group head of liability products, third party products and non-resident business at the bank.

Banks’ lending to non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) rose by 35.1 per cent to Rs 14.2 lakh crore in June, a report said.

Credit exposure of banks to NBFCs rose by a robust 35.1 per cent on-year to Rs 14.2 lakh crore in June, indicating non-banking finance firms’ decreased reliance on international borrowings. This also pushed up NBFCs’ share in overall credit from 8.5 per cent in June 2022 to 9.9 per cent in the reporting month, according to Sanjay Agarwal, a senior director with Care Ratings.

However, the report noted that the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank, effective July 1, will lead to a reduction in the share and also the exposure of banks to NBFCs, as HDFC’s bank borrowings will undergo a temporary reclassification, resulting in a shift of exposure to HDFC Bank. Meanwhile, mutual funds’ debt exposure to NBFCs, including through commercial papers (CPs) and corporate debt, also increased 14.5 per cent to Rs 1.62 lakh crore in June, it said.

According to the report, MF exposure to NBFCs as a share of debt assets under management has remained broadly constant hovering at around 10 per cent. On the other hand, the share of banks’ advances to NBFCs as a share of aggregate advances has doubled from around 4.5 per cent in February 2018 to nearly 10 per cent in June, indicating the reliance of NBFCs on bank lending.

The report also said that bank credit to NBFCs has been consistently moving up since the second half of FY22, coinciding with the phased reopening of the economy since the Covid pandemic. This growth momentum further accelerated in FY23 and in the first quarter of FY24, which can primarily be ascribed to NBFCs’ asset base.

Food delivery firm Swiggy has partnered with the country's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank to launch a co-branded credit card. The card will offer a hefty 10 percent cashback on food delivery grocery delivery under Instamart and its dining out platform Dineout. The card will be hosted on the Mastercard network.

The cashback offered is much higher than the usual five percent offered by brands for shopping on their own platform. For instance, Amazon, Flipkart, Paytm and Tata Neu only offer around five percent as cashback even though occasionally there could be a few extra offers. The Paytm and Tata Neu co-branded credit cards are also in partnership with HDFC Bank.

The Swiggy-HDFC card will also offer five percent cashback on shopping across other e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Nykaa, Ola, Uber, PharmEasy, NetMeds, BookmyShow, and several others, the statement said. In fact, with an Amazon-ICICI credit card, a customer cannot get five percent cashback on Flipkart and vice versa. Hence the Swiggy card makes more sense for anyone who shops across these platforms.

ALSO READ: Visa says co-branding offers opportunities for new categories to emerge

In one fell swoop, the card could make Amazon-ICICI and Flipkart-Axis credit cards irrelevant for most users as the cashback remains the same whether a customer uses the Amazon card, Flipkart card or the Swiggy card. However, there is a catch. The benefits of such high rewards can be reaped only if the customer uses Swiggy a lot every month. Because the cardholders will get cashback in the form of Swiggy Money, which can be used only on Swiggy.

However, the only catch being that the cashback will be deposited as Swiggy Money and can be used only on Swiggy. If a customer's monthly grocery purchases are more than Rs 4,000-5,000, it must not be difficult to use/exhaust the Swiggy Money buying grocery on Instamart.

For reference, even the Amazon ICICI credit card offers the cashbacks as Amazon Pay Balance and can be used only on Amazon and its partner merchants. However, the use cases of exhausting the Amazon Pay Balance is much wider with the platform offering insurance, flight tickets and hotel bookings.

The credit card launch and the aggressive cashback offers is happening at a time when Swiggy is gradually losing market share to Zomato and its grocery delivery platform Blinkit. The credit card could help cultivate loyalty and drive up its usage.

The co-branded credit card success story

HDFC is the country's largest credit card issuer. The bank has issued close to two crore credit cards in the country whereas the overall number of credit cards in the country stands around 10 crore as of June 30, according to RBI data.

Earlier this year, Swiggy's Gurugram-based rival Zomato had ended its co-branded card partnership with RBL Bank, which also offered 10 percent cashback on its premium Black edition, while the Classic edition offered only five percent cashbacks. It is not clear why the partnership has not worked out.

Some of the co-branded credit cards have been a runaway success among customers over the last four-five years with both Amazon and Flipkart adding 40 lakh users each. These cards see fully digital onboarding of the majority of the users apart from high usage and activation rates. Paytm has around seven lakhs customers for its cards.

Today, Amazon ICICI credit card is almost 30 percent of the ICICI credit card portfolio and the Flipkart Axis credit card is almost 40 percent of Axis Bank's credit card portfolio, indicating the importance of a successful cobranded partnership for banks. HDFC does not have such a huge success as of now. Today, one in three credit cards are cobranded credit cards whereas it was just 10 percent a decade ago. This has been driven by the new-age consumer internet brands.

While airlines, offline retail brands and oil marketing companies cards' used to be popular a decade ago, digital brands have taken their place as customer spending has also shifted towards the platform and has often demonstrated loyalty and stickiness.

For instance, the overall credit card spending on digital platforms were close to Rs 90,000 crore during the month of June, whereas the credit card spending at Point of Sale terminals (or offline channels) stood at Rs 50,000 crore, that is almost 80 percent higher on online platforms.

Who is the card for

While there are around 10 crore credit cards in the country, the unique number of credit card users is only around four crore. Most power users will have multiple cards and uses the cards to maximise value or cashbacks. Adding a Swiggy credit card will not hurt such users.

The cashback benefit of five percent is also applicable on branded websites like Nike, H&M, Adidas and Zara among others. Similar to Amazon and Flipkart credit cards, this card also offers one percent cashback on all other spending.

“We recognise that modern-day consumers actively seek rewards, offers, and cashback programs that add value to their spending,” said Rahul Bothra, Chief Financial Officer of Swiggy.

As a welcome benefit, the card is also offering a three-month Swiggy One membership that offers free delivery and additional discounts. The credit card will be rolled-out in a phased manner on the Swiggy app over the next 7-10 days, post which all the eligible customers will be able to apply for it on Swiggy app and HDFC website.

HDFC Bank’s managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan on July 19 warned managerial level employees of transgression from good working culture saying he is aware of such instances and has the resolve to ‘nip this in the bud.’

“I am fully conscious of the fact that there may be instances where some people managers might transgress our defined way of working,” Jagdishan said in his message to shareholders on July 19. “We have the resolve to nip this in the bud, both by way of training/counselling and appropriate action, to ensure that the same is not attempted by anyone else,” Jagdishan said.

Jagdishan, however, added that the bank has ‘some distance to traverse on this front.’ “We are taking concrete steps towards building an inclusive organisation, which will go a long way in reining in attrition in the coming years,” he added.

Why the comment is important

The comment from the CEO assumes significance in the backdrop of an incident recently circulated on social media with respect to the alleged unruly behaviour of one of the senior executives of the bank towards junior staff.

HDFC Bank on June 5 suspended the concerned officer in Kolkata for allegedly engaging in unruly behaviour with colleagues during an internal meeting. In a video circulating on Twitter, the officer was heard shouting at his junior colleagues for not selling enough banking and insurance products.

In a statement made available to Moneycontrol, HDFC Bank said that on the basis of a preliminary enquiry into the matter, the concerned employee has been suspended and a detailed investigation has been initiated which will be undertaken as per the Conduct guidelines of the bank.

The banking major further added that they have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of misconduct at the workplace and firmly believe in treating all our employees with dignity and respect.

In the video, the manager was asking his junior employee said, ""I don't understand, today you're going to do 25 smart ones, 25 sure covers, and 25 health covers.""

Misselling complaints

Incidents of product misselling have been reported across the banking industry. In the past, there have been instances where life insurance policies were sold to customers aged above 75 years in Tier II-III cities. Usually, branches of the banks push products of their subsidiary insurers.

Bank executives face immense pressure from top management to sell third-party products like insurance. Failure to meet targets invites informal penal actions while meeting targets brings perks such as parties in five-star resorts.

Banks typically cross-sell insurance products of their subsidiaries, and sometimes of other companies, along with loan products. Many a time, banks insist purchase of policies along with loan products. Early this year, the RBI had conducted a meeting with the board of directors of all public sector banks and private banks to discuss issues related to governance and ethics.

Emphasis on culture

In his message, Jagdishan stressed the importance of good working culture saying that it defines the experience of each employee.

“Managers are uniquely positioned to represent the culture the Bank stands for. Talent, Potential and Capabilities can best be harnessed through an enabling culture,” Jagdishan said.

Towards this aim, the bank has adopted the managerial behaviour architecture based on the principles of 'Nurture, Care and Collaborate', said Jagdishan, adding that this should translate into simple behaviours that managers can demonstrate in their interactions with their teams. The Nurture, Care, Collaborate initiative that covered over 12,000+ managers in the previous year was extended to the senior leadership levels and over 6,000 new managers in FY 2022-23, the CEO added.

“The intent is to have all managers at the Bank equipped to fully live the cultural ethos of the Bank,” Jagdishan said.

Increase in attrition

Jagdishan said the bank has experienced an increase in attrition over the last financial year, a significant part of which was in the ‘non-supervisory staff’ levels, including sales officers. Jagdishan attributed Covid as one of the reasons for high attrition that may have prompted the younger workforce to recalibrate what they ‘want from their lives’, the CEO said.

“This has led to increased attrition across all sectors. It is a reality that all major employers are grappling with, especially in the BFSI sector,” Jagdishan added.

Earlier, in an interaction with the media, the bank’s chief financial officer, Srinivasan Vaidyanathan had said that the lender witnessed a 30 percent employee attrition in the fiscal year 2022-23.

“On average, we saw the attrition rate at around 30 percent. Highest attrition was seen at the entry-level positions, which stood at around 40 percent to 50 percent,” Vaidyanathan said at a post-results media call.

A few levels above the entry-level, Vaidyanathan said that the attrition rate is around mid-20 percent to 30 percent, the CFO added.

HDFC and HDFC Bank got merged effective July 1, marking a major event in India’s banking sector. Post-merger, the loan book or advances of the merged entity jumped by 38.77 percent to Rs 22.21 lakh crore as against 16 lakh crore as on March 31, as per investor presentation of the bank.

The merger gave HDFC Bank entry to India's booming housing loan market while for HDFC, the decision made sense on account of vanishing regulatory arbitrage earlier available for non-banking finance companies.",884,-0.2966814257881858
2023-07-17 16:22:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/nbfcs-are-among-top-mutual-fund-buys-heres-why-10973611.html,"Between May and June, asset management companies upped their stake in HDFC, Shriram Finance, Creditaccess Grameen and Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services among several other names.

Financials remain the darlings of Dalal Street with non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) now grabbing the spotlight within this sector. In June, mutual funds heavily invested in NBFC stocks while booking profits from private banking stocks.

The current market sentiment suggests that the peak of the interest cycle is approaching its end, according to analysts and fund managers. As central banks in developed markets begin to cut interest rates, India is expected to follow suit. Resultantly, the liability costs for NBFCs are likely to decrease, leading to higher profit margins and increased profitability.

Mutual funds in June raised their holdings across various NBFC segments, be it housing finance, consumer finance, or microfinance. Loan demand remains strong across product categories like vehicle, SME/consumer segments, and gold finance. The Street expects assets under management (AUM) growth above 20 percent year on year for most NBFCs in Q1 FY24.

“Credit growth is now well-entrenched and can continue for the medium term. The credit cycle also looks good and predictable. The probability of any big NPL (non-performing loans) shocks coming over the next few quarters is very low,” Vinay Sharma, Fund Manager - Equity Investments, Nippon India Mutual Fund, said.

In June, asset management companies upped their stake in HDFC, Shriram Finance, Creditaccess Grameen and Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services among several other names. While HDFC can be looked at as MFs jumping on an arbitrage opportunity ahead of merger with HDFC Bank, inflows for other NBFCs were largely on the back of improving outlook on their asset quality and margins.

Why the optimism?

NBFCs borrow from banks or raise money from non-convertible debentures. In both cases, they are borrowing at high rates but at the same time, they are lending at even higher rates. “For instance, select NBFCs are raising funds while offering yields up to 10 percent per annum, but lending rates are also north of 14 percent. In that sense, the gross margin picture for NBFCs looks better than that of many banks that accept deposits at 7.5 percent and lend at around the 9 percent range,” explained Nirav Karkera of Fisdom.

While some NBFCs could see their NIMs (net interest margins) contract by 5-15 basis points, given the increase in the cost of funds, analysts at Systematix Institutional Equities believe other NBFCs will likely maintain or see a marginal increase in NIMs, aided by a change in their portfolio mix and upward revision in lending rates.

Moreover, when it comes to high-yield segments like SME (small and medium enterprise) loans, loans against property and unsecured personal B2C (business-to-consumer) loans, NBFCs are more willing to extend credit compared to several regulatory checks by banks. This is why NBFCs will be able to serve the increasing trend of financialisation better as they are playing the credit-risk game better, said analysts.

According to Krishna Sanghavi - CIO Equity, Mahindra Manulife Mutual Fund, NBFCs will continue to re-rate as the focus shifts from margin pressures. “FY23 saw some de-rating for NBFCs on concerns over margins while banks saw profit gains as well as re-rating. Q1FY24 saw a re-rating for NBFCs as post the policy pause by RBI, market expectations shifted away from margin pressure,” he said.

Bargain buys

Moreover, mutual funds also jumped at the opportunity to buy NBFC stocks at a bargain. For instance, CreditAccess Grameen and Shriram Finance both saw big block deals in June at a slight discount to the then market price. Canara Robeco, Axis Mutual Fund and HDFC AMC upped their stake in CreditAccess Grameen while Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC and Kotak Mahindra AMC, among others, bought into Shriram Finance.

“Meanwhile, cash flows have held up well and contributed to better collection efficiencies which will translate into benign credit costs across most of the NBFCs,” Ritesh Bhagwati - Head of Research - Rockstud Capital. In Q1 FY24, analysts expect the credit cost of most NBFCs likely to be maintained at Q4 levels, except for a few like Mahindra Finance and Cholamandalam Finance, which could see a normalised credit cost.

And finally, the space is also heating up with the entry of Jio Financial Services soon. While it is expected that JFS will disrupt the sector and heat up the competition, fund managers do not seem to mind loading up on the already listed names to capitalise on India's growth story.

Shares of Housing Development and Finance Corporation (HDFC) stopped trading on July 12, marking the end of an over four-decade-long journey for India’s oldest and biggest mortgage lender.

HDFC now lives on as part of HDFC Bank, but many market veterans view the company as a role model for corporate India and synonymous with the country’s socio-economic progress.

Here are some key highlights of HDFC’s market journey –

Founded by H T Parekh, uncle of Deepak Parekh. Incorporated on October 17, 1977

Deepak Parekh joined the company in 1978, leaving his Chase Manhattan Bank job where he was earning twice the salary offered by HDFC.

Deepak Parekh approached UTI seeking investment in HDFC’s IPO. UTI -- the only mutual fund in India that time -- refused, saying retail lending for home loans was too risky.

HDFC IPO launched in 1978. Issue size – Rs 10 crore (10 lakh shares of Rs 100 each). Shares issued to public at par (no premium).

126 equity shares of Rs 100 taken up by the subscribers to the Memorandum of Association, including 100 shares held by H T Parekh.

50,000 Equity shares of Rs 100 each subscribed by ICICI, the IFC (W) and HH the Aga Khan IV respectively.

4,50,000 equity shares of Rs 100 issued for private subscription.

3,99,874 equity shares of Rs 100 offered to the public. The Corporation received 10,697 applications for 4,73,976 equity shares. The Corporation allotted the shares to 10,543 applicants.

The stock has posted a stellar CAGR of around 19 percent over the last three decades. However, the CAGR for HDFC Bank is higher at 24 percent.

Rs 1,00,000 invested in HDFC in May 1995 would have grown to Rs 1,26,39,000 today (without dividends). However, Rs 1,00,000 invested in HDFC Bank would have increased to Rs 4,14,00,000 (without dividends).

HDFC received approval for setting up HDFC Bank in 1994. The bank was inaugurated in February 1995 by the then Finance Minister Dr Manmohan Singh.

HDFC took 33 years to hit the Rs 1-lakh crore m-cap mark. HDFC Bank reached the milestone in 15 years.

HDFC's market capitalisation reached Rs 2 lakh crore in February 2015, Rs 3 lakh crore in February 2018, Rs 4 lakh crore in July 2019, and Rs 5 lakh crore in February 2021.

In FY2000, HDFC’s net profit at Rs 400 crore was almost four times that of HDFC Bank at Rs 120 crore.

HDFC maintained its lead for the next decade. In FY2010, HDFC Bank overtook its parent in terms of net profit at Rs 2,949 crore vs Rs 2,826 crore for HDFC. The lead only widened over time.

For the financial year ended March 2023, HDFC reported a net profit of Rs 16,239 crore, compared to Rs 44,109 crore for HDFC Bank.

Even in terms of topline growth, HDFC Bank has usually outperformed its parent.

The HDFC IPO was a tepid affair, with shares listing below the issue price. Even at its last trading session on July 12, 2023, the share closed in the red, down nearly 1 percent at Rs 2,724.30 on the NSE.",523,0.20053911209106445

On July 12, the shares of Housing Development and Finance Corporation, or HDFC, stopped trading on bourses post the merger with HDFC Bank that came into effect on July 1. That marks the end of a four-decade-long journey for India’s oldest mortgage lender.

Founded by H T Parekh, uncle of Deepak Parekh, HDFC was incorporated on October 17, 1977, and disbursed its first home loan in 1978 to D. B. Remedios in Mumbai. To start with, the founding team had an unenviable job. Home loans were not a popular product back then and no one knew HDFC as a brand.

But the team worked hard and steadily expanded the business. By 1984, HDFC had crossed annual loan approvals of Rs 100 crore, a big milestone for the company. The company was listed in 1978 with a face value of Rs 100 each. The issue did not get a great response, in fact, it was undersubscribed.

Yet, that was the start of a remarkable journey to become a financial behemoth. On July 12, when the shares closed, HDFC had a market capitalisation of over Rs 5 lakh crore.

End of an era

Deepak Parekh, the man who played a key role in building India’s oldest mortgage lender from scratch, hung up his boots after four decades with the company. With Parekh stepping down from all roles, an era has ended.

In his last letter to shareholders of HDFC on June 30, Chairman Deepak Parekh announced his retirement ahead of the mega merger with HDFC Bank saying it is time for him to hang up his boots.

Parekh, 78, will not take up any role in the bank while HDFC Chief Executive Officer Keki Mistry is likely to join the bank's Board subject to clearance from the Reserve Bank of India.

""It is my time to hang my boots with both anticipation and hope for the future,"" Parekh told shareholders.

""While this will be my last communication to shareholders of HDFC, rest assured we now stride tall into a very exciting future of growth and prosperity,"" Parekh added. In a rather emotional letter, Parekh said the HDFC experience is invaluable. ""Our history cannot be erased and our legacy will be taken forward,"" said the veteran banker.

Questions on HDFC culture

In the letter, Parekh re-emphasised the importance of HDFC culture which helped the institution become a household name in India.

""An oft-repeated question is what happens to the culture of HDFC? My answer to this is that mergers are inherently about change. The work culture will be an amalgamation of the best of both organisations,"" Parekh wrote.

Explaining further, Parekh said the culture at the workplace is always a shared responsibility that needs daily reinforcement through the demonstration effect with the tone set at the top.

""As HDFC hands the baton, my wish is that our core founding values of kindness, fairness, efficiency and effectiveness get woven deeper into the fabric of the HDFC group,"" Parekh added.

In the letter, Parekh said HDFC Bank managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan and his team at the bank will take the HDFC legacy ahead.

""With the proven execution capabilities of HDFC Bank, we are confident that Sashi, together with the leadership team will forge an era of new opportunities for the combined entity,"" Parekh wrote in the letter.

Message to the bank?

In what appeared like a message or guidance to the bank with respect to home loan business, Parekh said that every home loan customer has their own story and it is the empathy factor that is the key differentiator between housing finance providers.

""Dealing with home loan customers requires immense patience. It is about understanding the needs and feelings of a home loan customer, assuaging their anxiety during this complex transaction, customising solutions, explaining financial implications of a mortgage product and lending responsibly to ensure a customer is not over-stretched,"" the veteran banker said.

Only home loan provider in the 80s

For CEO Keki Mistry too, this is the end of a long journey as HDFC CEO. In an interview with Moneycontrol in March this year, Mistry, who is associated with the HDFC brand for nearly 42 years, also highlighted that there will be structural opportunities in housing finance as the sector has seen tremendous change.

“In the early 1980s, we were the only housing loan provider. Convincing people in the 80s that housing finance and loan would work was a major challenge. But now the sustained demand for housing loans has been strong,” Mistry said.

Though the merger was discussed a few years ago, the plan entered a fast track in May 2021 with the bank deliberating the proposal at the top level and later approaching the parent with a proposal. HDFC Bank insiders say that compared with the previous boss of the bank, Aditya Puri, his successor Sashidhar Jagdishan was more amenable to the idea of a merger. Puri exited the bank in October 2020 and Jagdishan took charge as the new chief.

A good match for both parties

While the merger gave the much-need big entry to the bank into the lucrative home loan business, for the parent too, the decision made immense sense for one key reason. For NBFCs, life was getting tougher in India.

In his first-ever exclusive media interview post the merger announcement, Deepak Parekh told Moneycontrol that the NBFC business was getting tougher due to the tightening of the RBI regulations. “The constraint is that the RBI, over the last few years, removed the arbitrage between a bank and an NBFC,” he said.

Over the years, the RBI had brought in bank-like regulations for India’s big non-banks. Under the new multi-tiered structure for NBFCs (based on their asset size and systemic importance), bigger NBFCs were treated at par with banks on capital, regulatory scrutiny, and treatment of assets, which made operations even more expensive for this class of companies.

HDFC, with an over Rs 5-lakh-crore loan book, logically fell in the upper layer which meant it will be now monitored, inspected and regulated akin to a bank, whereas the incentives in NBFC business were less. However, when HDFC knocked on the doors of the regulator for a merger, it got a key relief.

The RBI gave critical relaxations on certain aspects such as priority sector lending norms and treatment of ownership of subsidiaries in April 21, 2023. Also, the RBI gave six months to HDFC customers to switch to new benchmarks.

Post-merger, the loan book of the merged entity will jump to Rs 22.21 lakh crore as on March 31, 2023, while deposits are at Rs 18.84 lakh crore. Further, HDFC Bank's market capitalisation will rise to Rs 14.6 lakh crore, from Rs 9.45 lakh crore prior to the merger. For the HDFC group, a great story ends and a new journey begins today.

HDFC Bank declined around 3 percent in morning trade on July 5, after the company announced its first quarter business update for FY24.

At 10.57 am, the stock was trading at Rs 1,671.80 on the National Stock Exchange, down 3.26 percent from the previous close.

HDFC Bank informed the exchanges on July 5 that its advances aggregated to approximately Rs 16.15 lakh crore for the quarter ended June 30, up nearly 15.8 percent year on year (YoY) from Rs 13.95 lakh crore a year ago. The bank's advances grew around 0.9 percent on quarter over quarter (QoQ) basis against Rs 16 lakh crore in Q4FY23.

The banks’s deposits jumped 19.2 percent YoY for the said quarter to Rs 19.13 lakh crore, as compared to Rs 16.04 lakh crore in Q1FY23. They were up 1.6 percent QoQ from Rs 18.83 lakh crore in the quarter ended March 31, 2023.

During the quarter under review, the retail deposits were increased by Rs 38,000 crore, growing by 21.5 percent YoY and 2.5 percent QoQ. The wholesale deposits improved by approximately 9 percent YoY and declined by around 2.5 percent QoQ.

In Q1FY24, the bank purchased loans aggregated to Rs 11,632 crore through the direct assignment route under the home loan arrangement with HDFC Ltd.

As on June 30, 2023, HDFC Bank's CASA deposits aggregated to Rs 8.13 lakh crore, an improvement of 10.7 percent over Rs 7.34 lakh crore as on June 30, 2022. CASA deposits were down 2.7 percent over Rs 8.36 lakh crore at March end. The retail CASA grew by 11 percent in Q1FY24 against Q1FY23, but fell by 2 percent QoQ. The Bank’s CASA ratio stood at around 42.5 percent in the said quarter, compared to 45.8 percent in Q1FY23 and 44.4 percent in Q4FY23.

Commenting on the update, analysts at brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher stated, “Loan growth numbers are lower, probably due to focus on the merger. While loan offtake seems to be lower for the system, retail growth was strong at 4 percent QoQ, which is a positive, and the share of retail is expected to improve this quarter.” They further added that deposit accretion has been in-line with credit offtake, although the 2.7 percent QoQ decline in CASA seemed seasonal in nature. The brokerage firm has given a “Buy” rating on the stock at a target price of Rs 1925.

Merged Entity Q1 Update

Some key takeaways about HDFC Bank and HDFC’s merged balance sheet:

-Gross advances were up 13.1 YoY and 0.7 percent QoQ basis, reaching Rs 22.45 lakh crore.

- Deposits aggregated to approximately Rs 20.63 lakh crore in Q1FY24, up 16.2 percent YoY and 1.2 percent QoQ.

- The merged entity's average liquidity coverage ratio for the Q1 stood at around 120 percent on a proforma basis.

The merger of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), India's oldest and largest mortgage lending firm, with HDFC Bank came into effect on July 1. And it is an emotional moment for many old HDFC employees who spent a lifetime with the company.

Some HDFC employees Moneycontrol spoke to recall their early days, including the struggles of selling home loans when the product wasn't popular. ""I still remember the first day I joined HDFC. Now I've worked for more than two decades with the company, and it feels like home to me,"" said Nitin Walia, Assistant Manager of a branch in Delhi.

Another employee, who did not wish to be named, said after working 34 years at HDFC, the culture of the company is what he will miss the most. ""The spirit of working and the culture is the most important thing I experienced in my career at HDFC,"" said the employee.

""HDFC is an iconic brand. No one can take HDFC from us,"" said another senior employee.

""My 17 years in HDFC were full of a roller-coaster ride. Now to see that HDFC merged with HDFC Bank is a happy moment,"" said Shalabh Sharma, Deputy Manager at an HDFC branch in Mumbai.

Old days

HDFC opened in 1977 and was the sole mortgage lender in India at that time. Keki Mistry, CEO and Vice Chairman, HDFC, in an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol in March 2023, said that initially it was the only mortgage lender in India, and, with time, “we created our competition.""

""We trained some individuals and banks to start mortgage lending. During the early years of the company, home loans were not popular in India,"" Mistry said.

Echoing this, Sharma said that his role in the initial years involved developing leads and contacts. ""In the early years, people did not know about home loans. Before selling, there was a need for informing,"" said Sharma.

Mahesh Shah, former Corporate Communications Head at HDFC, said that the first word that comes to his mind when he recalls his journey with HDFC is commitment. Shah recalled that in May 1987, Deepak Parekh, Chairman, HDFC, came to Cross Maidan to motivate the HDFC Cricket team during the finals of the Corporate Cricket tournament ‘The Times Shield.’

""He took me for a stroll on the ground as it was a lunch break to discuss the status of the match which he responded HDFC will win. He wanted to know if we needed to strengthen the team to meet the challenges of a higher level and he stuck to his commitment of a spinner being recruited,"" said Shah.

The evolution

HDFC Bank was incorporated in 1994 as a banking subsidiary of HDFC in Mumbai. With time, HDFC and HDFC Bank became mammoths in their respective sectors. The bank’s loan book, over the years, grew tremendously from Rs 2.3 lakh crore in 2013 to Rs 16 lakh crore in 2023. As of March 2023, the market capitalisation of HDFC Bank is Rs 9.5 lakh crore and that of HDFC is Rs 5.2 lakh crore.

The struggle of selling a home loan was something that HDFC faced in the years of its evolution. Parekh, in a press conference in Mumbai, on June 27, said that he still remembers the first loan the company gave. ""Our first home loan was of Rs 30,000. We took photographs of the customer with his house and made it the cover picture of our first annual report,"" said Parekh.

Shah recalled that during his time in HDFC, he remembered the growth of the company and summed it up in one word — commitment. ""The management of the company created an environment of subtleness and friendliness from the earliest days,"" said Shah.

Culture of HDFC

Parekh said HDFC and HDFC Bank have different cultures due to the nature of their business. However, though there is some difference, the company aims to have the same culture in the bank, he added. ""We want to have the culture of HDFC in HDFC Bank. Culture is the essential part of our organisation. A bank which does not do housing will have a different culture,"" said Parekh.

Mistry also said that there is not much cultural difference in HDFC and HDFC Bank and that every single employee from the mortgage lender will get absorbed into the bank. ""We don't see too many cultural differences between the two entities and all our staff. We have reassured that every single employee of HDFC will be taken into the bank,"" said Mistry.

The employee, who did not wish to be named, highlighted that the culture at HDFC is one thing he takes pride in. ""Culture is the essence of a workplace. I felt a home-like culture at HDFC,"" said the employee.

The merger

HDFC and HDFC Bank announced the decision to merge on April 4, 2022. As per the plan, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the merger.

In fact, Parekh had said, back in 2015 itself, that his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank, if circumstances were favourable. But the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense, provided there is no loss for shareholders.

Sashidhar Jagdishan, Managing Director, HDFC Bank, on an analyst call on May 24, said that the merger is only about a month away.

Once the deal comes into force, HDFC Bank will be 100 percent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 percent of the bank. With the parent finally joining with the bank, the combined entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry.",1041,0.8886545300483704

Having successfully executed the merger with parent HDFC, HDFC Bank's managing director and chief executive Sashidhar Jagdishan on Saturday said the country's largest lender aims to double every four years.

In a letter to the over 4,000 employees from HDFC who joined the bank's rolls on Saturday, Jagdishan said the future is bright, and the work on realising the potential of the merger starts now.

""The runway for financial services and mortgage, which are so underserved and under penetrated, is going to be very large. HDFC Bank - the combined entity - with a large and growing distribution and customer franchise, more than adequate capital, healthy asset quality and profitability, will be best positioned to capture growth. The pace at which we aim to grow - we could be creating a new HDFC Bank every 4 years,"" he said.

HDFC Bank began the day one after the merger with a rebranding exercise, wherein it is putting up its colours at all the over 500 branches and offices of HDFC Ltd.

The erstwhile HDFC's corporate headquarters at Ramon House already sports the HDFC Bank branding, and officials estimated that the entire exercise will be over in the next 24 hours.

It can be noted that dedicated teams have been put in place to make the merger as seamless as possible, right since its announcement on April 4 last year. As part of the USD 40 billion all-share deal, the biggest in Indian corporate history, HDFC Bank had committed to absorb all the over 4,000 employees of its parent.

""Our work starts from today, in realising the potential of what this merger holds for us,"" Jagdishan wrote.

To realise its growth aims, Jagdishan said the bank will be adding about 1,500 branches every year for some years to better serve the middle class and upper segment of the country.

It will continue investments on the digital front as well which, Jagdishan said, will make HDFC Bank into a 'technology company into banking"", and added that the same will get unveiled over the next three years.

The bank will be assessing its people on the basis of how they conduct governance and compliance, teamwork and their ability to delight customers, he said.

The canvas being offered to the HDFC Ltd employees is large -- both professionally and personally, the email said, adding that an external expert was appointed to arrive at the right formula for inducting people into the bank and deciding their role in the hierarchy.

Jagdishan said the cost-to-revenue ratio of HDFC at 0.04 per cent was the lowest for any mortgage company in the world, and thanked its leadership, including Deepak Parekh, Keki Mistry and Renu Karnad, for creating such an institution.

He said from a customer perspective, the home loan is a very emotional product which establishes a great bond between the financier and borrower and added that HDFC Bank would like to harness the same bond.

""The penetration levels of the home loan product in its (HDFC Bank's) customer base and the extent the distribution has been leveraged, is quite low. This is an opportunity! The runway for growth is going to be large and for a long time to come,"" Jagdishan said.

HDFC Bank will move from sales management to a relationship management model because of the opportunity to cross-sell that exists within the franchise after the addition of mortgage finance, insurance and asset management subsidiaries, Jagdishan said.

""The velocity of product sales and the reduced touch points to serve the customer will be a game changer with this 'power of bundling',"" he added.

HDFC Ltd, the parent of the country's largest private sector lender, merged into HDFC Bank on Saturday, with boards of both entities clearing the plan first presented on April 4 last year. HDFC Ltd, the largest pure-play home financier, ceases to exist 44 years after it was founded.

The USD 40-billion merger, the largest such deal in Indian corporate history, is driven by a changing regulatory landscape, which limited the advantages for HDFC continuing as a non-bank lending entity.

Post-merger, HDFC Bank will become the fourth most valued lender in the world, and narrow the gap by asset size with state-owned SBI to be the second largest Indian bank.

The total business of the merged entity stood at Rs 41 lakh crore at the end of March 2023. With the merger, the networth of the entity would be over Rs 4.14 lakh crore.

The combined profit of both entities was to the tune of about Rs 60,000 crore at the end of March 2023.

With the deal getting effective, HDFC Bank will be 100 per cent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 per cent of the bank. Every HDFC shareholder will get 42 shares of HDFC Bank for every 25 shares they hold.

The board of directors of HDFC Bank in consultation with the board of directors of HDFC Limited has fixed July 13, 2023, for determining the shareholders of HDFC Ltd who would be issued and allotted the shares of HDFC Bank, it added.

Besides, July 13 has been fixed for the continuation of warrants of HDFC Limited in the name of HDFC Bank.

The board has fixed July 12, 2023, for the transfer of non-convertible debentures while July 7 for the transfer of commercial papers of HDFC Ltd in the name of HDFC Bank.

The merged entity brings together significant complementarities that exist between both entities and is poised to create meaningful value for various stakeholders, including respective customers, employees and shareholders of both entities from increased scale, comprehensive product offering, balance sheet resiliency and ability to drive synergies across revenue opportunities, operating efficiencies and underwriting efficiencies, a statement said.",986,0.7657781481742859
