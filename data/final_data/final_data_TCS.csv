Tata Consultancy Services stock was trading flat on November 22 afternoon after the company said it would make a provision of $125 million as an exceptional item in the third quarter as the US Supreme Court rejected its challenge to a penalty in a dispute with Epic Systems.

At 1.32 pm, TCS was trading at Rs 3,512 on the NSE, up 0.053 percent from the previous close.

India's largest IT services company was in a trade secret dispute with US-based Epic Systems. The US Supreme Court rejected TCS' appeal against a verdict passed by the District Court of Wisconsin, upholding $140 million punitive damages, the company said.

Epic Systems had filed a trade secret lawsuit against TCS and Tata America International Corp in 2014. The company accused the Tata Group companies of stealing its intellectual properties to develop its own, though it was contracted to implement Epic's healthcare software.

TCS was found guilty by a jury in 2016 and asked to pay damages of $940 million initially to Epic Systems. A year later, the fine was reduced to $420 million, which included $280 million in punitive damages and $140 in compensatory damages.

The punitive damages were later held to be excessive after TCS appealed to the US Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit, Chicago, and the trial court was told to reassess it. This punitive damage was then reduced by the US District Court for Western District of Wisconsin to $140 million in July 2022.

The ouster of Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO and the face of the AI boom, is unlikely to have a long-term impact on the company’s existing business partnerships with Indian IT services companies and the pace of generative AI innovations, said industry experts.

Over the past year, even as demand continued to slow down in a tough business environment, IT companies banked on customers’ generative AI curiosity to win deals, leading to billions of dollars being invested to develop industry-specific use cases of the technology and upskilling employees.

Altman’s abrupt firing on November 17, shook the technology world as it comes at a time when competition from big tech rivals Google, IBM and NVIDIA is intensifying.

In the short run, said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of management consulting firm Everest Group, Altman’s exit is unlikely to affect OpenAI’s partnerships and commercial agreements. But in the long run, it may affect the company’s ability to raise capital, which could make it a less attractive partner, he told Moneycontrol.

OpenAI, which started as a ‘non-profit’ organisation, later transitioned to a hybrid ‘capped-profit’ company, letting it raise funds externally, while ensuring that the original non-profit operation would still benefit. It has so far raised $10 billion from Microsoft at a valuation of almost $30 billion, as it invests in building computing capacity.

This structure, however, led to a lot of confusion reports suggest. OpenAI is structured in a way that the non-profit owns and controls a subsidiary that received funds from Microsoft, causing Altman to not have a say in the AI unicorn’s boardroom workings.

According to the company’s charter, its principal beneficiary is “humanity”, not investors.

Phil Fersht, CEO, HFS Research, a global business research consultancy, expects confusion and some chaos in the short term. The whole episode, he said, smells like a “coup d'état, with Altman becoming too powerful and not pandering to the OpenAI board”.

“However, the AI revolution has so much momentum, with many enterprise clients seeking so much support and advice from leading services firms when it comes to AI, that services firms will work even harder with Altman’s successor to ensure continuity and progressive value as these technologies evolve and mature,” he told Moneycontrol.

IT services companies such as Accenture, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra have in recent times been in overdrive to build their AI capabilities and offerings.

Billions at stake

While not pertaining to OpenAI’s ChatGPT alone, generative AI’s current boom has seen billions being invested by IT companies to develop the tech with ChatGPT and other partners like Google. IT companies have already charted their next few years of business growth around AI’s rapid evolution.

As of Q2FY24, TCS already has more than 250 generative AI opportunities in the pipeline and it has completed training over 100,000 employees in this field.

Infosys had over 50 active generative AI projects in the pipeline. In fact, it announced three large deals in Q2: a $2-billion contract with an existing customer to provide AI and automation-led development and maintenance services over five years; a $1.5-billion deal with Liberty Global over five years; and an MoU that was signed for $1.5 billion, where the spend is over 15 years.

HCLTech, too, had earlier said that it has over 140 external and internal generative AI projects at various stages of maturity—from PoCs to implementation. The company will be training around 20,000 associates in generative AI skills and has set up three global labs.

Meanwhile, Wipro is investing $1 billion to strengthen its AI capabilities over the next three years. It will train 250,000 associates in required skills. Accenture is investing $3 billion to enhance data and AI capabilities in the next three years.

Internally, too, these companies have started seeing an increase of up to 30 percent in productivity by using generative AI for coding and several other functions.

But now, as OpenAI’s future remains uncertain, it’s going to be up to the partners or the IT services companies to “determine the level of risk / reward they want to be in with OpenAI or go with Sam’s new company,” said Ray Wang, CEO of Constellation Research, a technology advisory firm.

Queries sent to TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Capgemini and LTIMindtree didn’t elicit any responses at the time of publishing. Any comments from the companies will be updated in this article later.

Beyond OpenAI

Also, analysts unanimously believed that while ChatGPT got the ball rolling for generative AI in November 2022, giving investor Microsoft a head start, the quick catchup by Google and other rivals have made the technology and its future prospects too big to fail or to be controlled by one company.

As Bendor-Samuel put it, “The cat is out of the bag, and the Gen AI race is on, without regard to what happens at open AI. There is so much investment in this area that even if Open AI stumbles the overall pace of innovation will continue unabated.”

Fersht added, “If OpenAI derails as a result of this, it will hinder innovation in the short term, but nothing is slowing the pace of innovation in AI, and we’ll see other entities emerging at the forefront of this rapidly evolving industry,” he added.

Security and governance concerns

Moreover, the biggest takeaway for enterprise customers right now from Altman’s exit will be to focus on improving and fixing security and governance loopholes amidst fast-paced innovation. This was one of the primary concerns of OpenAI’s board amid Altman’s aggressive push on releasing new features and innovations, as security may have taken a backseat.

“The balance between too much governance and not enough innovation was the challenge the board faced,” said Wang. “The big worries were ownership of training data, impact of untested models, unwanted bias detection. Google has been the most careful and the most innovative. Microsoft has been very careful and the most adaptive. OpenAI was the least careful and the fastest innovator.”

Sanchit Vir Gogia, founder and CEO of market intelligence firm Greyhound Research concurred, adding that the company had faced flak for issues around ethical use of data to train the model and, more importantly, the intellectual property and compliance issues that customers can face.

""This is because Microsoft, as a key investor, is already significantly using the technology in their products, and this commercialisation is not the agenda with which the company was founded,” he told Moneycontrol.

Fersht added that concerns surrounding trust, security and compliance are massive for enterprises when it comes to AI and are only just starting to exacerbate.

Manish Maheshwari, former Twitter India head and co-founder of Fanory.ai, a platform that leverages AI for creators, believes OpenAI's recent move to part ways with Altman signals a significant shift towards prioritising ethical AI development over immediate commercial benefits.

“At the heart of Silicon Valley's evolving ethos is a deep-seated tension between commercial success and ethical technology development…This decision, while bold, has left many in the tech industry both surprised and contemplative about the future direction of AI,"" he said.",1178,-0.1607093328521365

The government is likely to announce exemption from tax collected at source (TCS) on overseas credit and debit card spending by an individual of up to Rs 7 lakh per financial year in the interim budget, a senior official said.

An amendment to the Income-Tax Act will be a part of the Finance Bill next year, the official said.

“TCS exemption for the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) on any payments by an individual using their international debit or credit cards up to Rs 7 lakh, announced during the year, has to be legislated. It’s not in the Income Tax Act currently, it has to be brought under it. Some legislation will be required,” the official told Moneycontrol. “This will be an amendment in the Finance Bill. It has to come into the Income Tax Act as an amendment. It will be part of the Union Budget.”

The government earlier this year brought credit cards within the ambit of LRS to implement 20 percent TCS on this mode of spending. After a widespread backlash, the finance ministry decided to exempt international spending of up to Rs 7 lakh from TCS of 20 percent.

“To avoid any procedural ambiguity, it has been decided that any payments by an individual using their international debit or credit cards up to Rs 7 lakh per financial year will be excluded from the LRS limits and hence, will not attract any TCS. Existing beneficial TCS treatment for education and health payments will also continue,"" the finance ministry said in a statement on May 19.

No other announcements

The exemption announcement is likely to be part of the upcoming vote on account, ahead of the general elections in 2024.

“Since the upcoming budget is a vote-on-account, no other major tax-related announcements are likely,” the official added.

A vote on account enables a government that’s completing its term to fund its expenses for a short period until a full budget is passed.

The government proposed in the Union Budget 2023 to hike TCS for overseas packages to 20 percent from 5 percent. Credit cards had till then been left out of LRS, while debit cards were covered because they were linked to bank accounts. Bank account transactions can be easily monitored and covered by LRS. But this distinction was done away with by a notification from the Ministry of Finance earlier in 2023, bringing credit cards on par for LRS purposes.

The 20 percent TCS on overseas packages was supposed to be applicable from July 1 but was implemented from October 1.

In March 2023, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said during the Budget session of Parliament that the Reserve Bank of India had been asked to bring credit card payments for foreign tours under the purview of the LRS as such payments escaped TCS.",497,

Australian bourse operator ASX Ltd said on November 20 it entered a deal with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to design and replace its trading, clearing, and settlement system, after months of backlash since pulling a blockchain-based overhaul of the system last year.

ASX said it would implement the new product-based platform in two main releases, with the clearing service to be delivered in a first release, and the settlement and sub-register services in a second release.

The estimated cost for the first release of the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) project is between A$105 million ($68.33 million) and A$125 million, to be incurred over multiple years, ASX said.

""ASX considers that the chosen product will allow it to provide a reliable, supportable and scalable platform that meets the needs of the Australian market now and into the future,"" it said in a statement.

ASX’s initial attempt to overhaul CHESS earned rebuke from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and Reserve Bank of Australia, with the regulators demanding more thorough reporting on plans to update the 30-year-old software.

ASIC had also opened an investigation into ASX’s public disclosures about the previous project before it was shelved.

ASX had been looking to replace its aging all-in-one legacy CHESS software using blockchain-based technology, but abandoned the overhaul in November last year citing dysfunctional management, concerns about the product’s complexity and scalability, and difficulty finding experts to support it.

In other major financial markets, clearing and settlement, or confirming the transfer of stock ownership and updating share registries, are managed by separate entities to the market operator, and the initial failed CHESS overhaul prompted Australia to pass laws to encourage competition to break up ASX’s monopoly over clearing and settlement.

""It will be critical for ASX to now focus on engaging with the market on the detailed design of the CHESS Replacement program with a realistic and achievable timeline for implementation,"" ASIC Chair Joe Longo said in a separate statement.

""ASX will also need to ensure existing CHESS continues to be maintained to meet ongoing resilience, reliability, integrity, and security requirements,"" ASIC added.

The estimated time frame for implementation of the first release is 2026, and for the second release is 2028 or 2029, ASX said on November 20, adding that further stakeholder consultation for the next phase of the CHESS replacement project is set to start in the first quarter of 2024.

ASX also entered a deal with Accenture to provide additional capability and capacity in the project delivery.

""This next phase of the project will be a multi-year undertaking and ASX will maintain our investment in the current CHESS platform to ensure it continues to operate efficiently and reliably until the replacement is implemented,"" ASX CEO Helen Lofthouse said.

A former TCS employee was arrested from her home in Belagavi, Karnataka on Wednesday for making a hoax bomb call to the company’s Bengaluru office.

According to an Indian Express report, a team from Bengaluru Police reached Belagavi on November 15 to arrest B Shruthi Shetty from her home. Shetty, 26, had called the transport help desk of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) office in Bengaluru a day earlier, claiming there was a bomb inside the building.

Her call triggered an evacuation of the TCS office in Bengaluru. After realising it was a hoax call, TCS assistant security officer Raju Chetry informed the police and an investigation was launched.

A team of Bengaluru Police arrested Shetty from her Belagavi home on November 15. Upon questioning the 26-year-old woman, police learned that she was upset that TCS would not rehire her. A BBM graduate, Shetty had quit her TCS job to pursue an MBA in 2017.

She was not rehired when she tried to join the organisation again. In fact, she applied to several organisations but could not get employment anywhere.

During her time at TCS, Shetty had gotten to know a bus driver who worked for the company. On the evening of November 14, under the influence of alcohol and upset at not being rehired, she dialled the driver and claimed that she had placed a bomb in Block B of the TCS Bengaluru office.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has sent out transfer notices to over 2,000 employees across locations, asking them to join the assigned location within 15 days, according to IT employee union Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES). This comes a month after TCS made it mandatory for employees to work from office five days a week.

According to a few emails seen by Moneycontrol, employees were given a notice of around two weeks to move to the assigned locations. Based on the company policies applicable, employees will be able to reimburse travel and accommodation costs. Employees started receiving these emails from the end of August.

Failing to adhere to this will lead to the employees facing “initiation of disciplinary actions.”

At least 180 outraged employees have sent complaints to NITES, alleging TCS of forcing them to shift “without proper notice or consultation, causing immense hardship for them and their families.” The IT union has now filed a formal complaint with the Ministry of Labour and Employment against TCS for unethical transfer practices.

Harpreet Singh Saluja, President, NITES said, “The company is ignoring all the financial hardship, family disruption, stress and anxiety that these forced transfers cause to employees… TCS is putting its employees through unnecessary hardship and is violating their rights. We have urged the Ministry of Labour and Employment to investigate TCS's actions and take appropriate measures to protect IT workers from such unethical practices.”

A TCS executive seeking anonymity told Moneycontrol that this is a routine movement done on a case-to-case basis, as the company tends to ask required employees to move to certain locations depending on the projects assigned.

“This is especially applicable for the freshers who may have been trained at different locations, but are now getting deployed on actual projects,” the executive added.

The company, however, declined to comment on Moneycontrol’s emailed queries.

Saluja told Moneycontrol that while some employees have agreed and already moved to the locations assigned, around 150-200 employees were still hesitant and in conversation with HR officers of the company regarding their concerns. But once their two-week timeline ended, without any further notices their email access was revoked for not shifting.

“These employees were not able to communicate with the HRs over email anymore. HRs then asked them to report to the assigned locations immediately, else they would stand to lose their salaries and jobs,” he said.

Saluja added, ""In fact, the employees who shifted to Mumbai location on 'urgent business' nearly a month ago, are still on bench. They haven't been assigned work yet.""

Five days of work from office

This comes over a month after TCS sent out emails asking certain teams to work from office at least five days a week, starting from October 1, 2023.

While the hybrid work transition mandate expecting three days work from office will still be the norm, Moneycontrol’s sources have shared that managers in various divisions have been nudging employees to come in to office five times a week.

TCS has almost 20,000 employees in the Nordic countries and also one of its biggest customers, Telenor, as per UnearthInsight’s data. TCS’ headcount has doubled from about 9,000 in 2018.

Infosys has over 2,500 employees in the region. It opened a centre in Sweden in December last year. Wipro has over 2,000 employees and HCLTech has about 1,600 employees in the region.

After sustained growth in Finland, Tech Mahindra announced a new local innovation centre in Espoo in September.

Experts and analysts called this demand uptick from Nordic customers a reflection of the price competitiveness, ability to become long-term strategic digital transformation partners, and the quality hi-tech services provided by Indian IT services companies.

Pricing opportunities

“If you look at a differential between a local tech services or global tech services firm versus Indian tech services firm, it's easily 10 percent to 15 percent, or in some cases, up to 18 percent,” said Gaurav Vasu, founder of market intelligence firm UnearthInsight. “Infosys’ Danske Bank deal is a good example of the growing popularity of Indian IT services firms.”

Infosys bagged a five-year digital transformation deal worth $454 million from Danske Bank in June 2023.

Vasu said that inflationary pressures are expected to continue in the Nordics too, but instead of curtailing overall tech spending, they are opting for vendor partners with strategic capabilities.

“They are open to choosing more optimal partners who can help them sustain at 4-5 percent of revenue, as technology spend reduces from about 6 percent over the next three to five years. European clients believe Indian pure plays will actually help them with around 1.5 to 2 percent cut and partner with them to sustainably deliver the outcomes,” he added.

How deal wins trended for the Indian IT companies in Nordics

Pareekh Jain, founder of EIIRTrend, said a lot of the business from regional service providers are now going to Indian IT companies in the Nordics.

“Indian IT firms are seeing more market share in these regions as compared to global counterparts. As technology is improving, these IT firms are able to invest in new technologies at a scale that regional service providers might not be able to… Only MNCs can invest,” Jain told Moneycontrol.

He added, “Nordics is the first preference for the Indian IT companies outside their other core geographies because it’s easier to access. There aren't many language constraints as most people speak English. Also, unlike countries like Germany and France, Nordics are more open to outsourcing and do a lot of business in other countries.”

Vasu said Europe-specific tech partners have not been able to manage the cost inflation situation and the pricing situation as well as Indian players.

Spending recovery

According to data from technology research and advisory firm ISG, Nordic expenditure on managed-services outsourcing is now close to pre-pandemic levels. The managed-services business recorded a 9 percent increase in annual contract value in the first half of 2023.

Chris Owen, principal consultant, Nordics, ISG, said this growth in tech spending across the Nordics was driven by the manufacturing and financial services sectors. Even the recent fall of the region’s currencies, especially against the dollar and the euro, played a role.

“This has increased the pressure on companies with local revenue bases to optimise costs via technology-driven transformation, alongside partners with accelerators to help. The primary driver, however, continues to be access to talent, partnering with experts to help organisations on their digital journey, and the maturity of the Nordic enterprise buyers is high (some even 4th generation outsourcers now). So we see this being procured from a truly global mix of providers, albeit ones who offer at least some local delivery resource,” Owen told Moneycontrol.

While the Indian IT companies have had customers in the Nordics, the market has accelerated in recent years and they are looking at it more strategically because the US and European markets remain uncertain, EIIRTrend’s Jain said.

Nordic companies are also more open to selling their captive centres as not many of them were big and scaled-up, he added.",816,0.44768221269954334

(Photo via Wikimedia Commons)

In October 2012, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) won a contract from the UK government to design, build and operate an IT system for the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS). It was an eight-year contract worth £350 million for DBS, which operates a safeguarding service by providing criminal record checks and a ""barring"" service list to prevent people deemed unsuitable from working with children or vulnerable adults. A decade later, both parties are locked in a bitter dispute in the high court in London, in what has been described as the biggest IT trials in recent years.

TCS has made a claim for £125 million, while DBS has issued a counterclaim for £150 million. By UK standards, the amounts may not be really eye-watering, but the eight-week trial involving over 30 witnesses and a dispute that centres around a failed modernization project involving a UK public service body, raises the profile of the case.

The dispute

TCS claims its attempts to progress and go live with the modernized systems were frustrated by DBS at every stage. The court was told that DBS through mismanagement of its IT hosting provider and by its decision to abandon part of the modernization hindered the project. The agreement expired in March 2020, and TCS’s main claim is for the increased costs it had to incur due to delays to the project.

DBS denies these claims and instead puts the blame for the delay on TCS, saying that the IT major was unable to deliver on time or “in relation to part of the system, at all within the term of the agreement.” It also characterized part of the system that was delivered by TCS in September 2017 as suffering from “serious defects.” DBS says it is entitled to substantial sums from TCS due to the delay, and non-compliance of the delivered system with contractual standards.

However, TCS claims that DBS’s criticisms of the software are “difficult to reconcile with the fact that the bulk of it is still in daily use by DBS.” In court filing, the company maintains: “It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the primary function of DBS’s counterclaim is to match and then over-top TCS’s claim.” On the other hand, DBS counters TCS’s delay claim by saying that the latter relies on conduct of a third-party supplier which does not amount to breaches of agreement by DBS. They say that the critical delay was caused as the software was “not ready to be deployed due to problems with development and testing.”

Broadly speaking, the court will hear expert evidence in three disciplines of IT, delay and forensic accountancy. Simon Croall, Andrew Carruth and Will Mitchell instructed by Bristows partner Anna Cook appear from DBS, while Stephen Kogley, Matthew Lavy and Ian Munro instructed by Joby Davies and Rachel Ziegler from BCLP represent TCS.

As both the sides continue their arguments, Justice Adam Constable’s court at any given time is packed by over 20 members comprising legal teams representing both the parties.

The contract

In 2012, when TCS got this contract, it became the first exception to the UK government policy of not awarding any public sector contract greater than £100 million to one single party unless in exceptional circumstances. TCS beat UK-based Capita which had managed the Criminal Records Bureau disclosure service, DBS’s predecessor, for 10 years.

In 2018, the UK National Audit Office came out with a report which stated that the updated service has not delivered the savings the Home Office originally intended. The report stated: “Modernisation of DBS is currently running over three and a half years late. The first stage was originally due by March 2014 but was only delivered in September 2017.”

The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) criticized the Home Office for failing to effectively manage the DBS modernization program terming it a “masterclass in incompetence” in May 2018. The influential PAC also noted: “The DBS modernisation programme is another example of a Home Office project marred by poor planning and contracting delays, spiralling costs, and a failure to understand what service users want.”

The PAC spoke to various stakeholders and its report mentioned that both the Home Office and TCS accepted that the contract for modernization was signed in 2012 without “anyone having a clear understanding of what it would take to make the programme successful.”

The contract thus came under intense media glare and public scrutiny and gives the background for the keenly fought legal battle.

What the parties want

The thrust of TCS’s argument is that DBS is completely responsible for the delay for which it must be compensated. TCS is pleading that DBS is seeking extravagant sums, whereas the latter’s counterclaim should in reality fail. DBS has invited the court to dismiss TCS’s claim and instead award them damages and various other payments which they say are rightly due to them.

The trial continues and a judgment by Justice Adam Constable is most likely expected in 2024.",868,-0.9342562437057496

One of the most crucial campaigns of Alexander the Great was the Battle of Hydaspes in 326 BC, when he went up against King Porus of Punjab. Porus’s mighty army relied heavily on its contingent of war elephants, which struck fear into the hearts of his enemies. However, on the day of the battle, the Macedonian phalanx managed to repulse the giant beasts, which turned around in panic and trampled many of their own soldiers to death.

The episode has played out multiple times in Indian history, and not just in warfare. Size might be a critical advantage in many situations, but it also risks being the biggest drag when the winds turn unfavourable.

Take the current Q2 earnings season, for example.

The country’s biggest IT firm TCS, biggest private sector lender HDFC Bank and largest NBFC Bajaj Finance have for long been benchmarks for Corporate India.

But as their Q2 report card shows, a larger surface area has not only amplified the impact of global and domestic headwinds, but also added to the biggest burden facing any company - the weight of expectations.

Tech Turbulence

TCS kicked off the Q2 results season with a contraction in USD revenues for the first time since the pandemic-hit June 2020 quarter as well as the highest-ever quarterly decline in headcount.

The IT major bore the brunt of the growth pangs in the US and EU, which account for around 68 percent of its topline.

Elevated interest rates and weak consumer sentiment in Western economies have led to a continued slowdown in discretionary spends, leading to delays in decision-making as well as deal conversions.

TCS, Infy, Wipro stocks in red since Q2 results; should you buy IT shares?

“Management highlighted that while the company is able to sign large deals and the new projects are ramping up on time, revenue leakage from existing projects due to deferrals or ramp downs is impacting revenue growth. Furthermore, management highlighted that the demand sentiment has not changed and clients remain cautious,” analysts at Jefferies said.

The silver lining was that deal wins remained strong at $11.2 billion, its second-highest-ever deal total contract value (TCV) and also the third consecutive quarter of deal wins staying above $10 billion - a milestone for India’s $245-billion Indian IT industry.

However, Q2 deal wins were driven by two mega deals with TCV of around $1 billion each from BSNL and JLR. Worryingly, order wins across the key market of North America slumped 13.5 percent QoQ to $4.5 billion.

Needless to say, the Street has taken note of this slowing juggernaut. TCS is the worst performer among the top 3 IT firms for the past month.

Growth Pangs

Probably the most vivid demonstration of ‘big is not always better’ philosophy right now is HDFC Bank, which reported its first quarterly results after it merged with the parent Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC).

While the Q2 numbers are not comparable to the pre-merger period, HDFC Bank’s management had provided proforma numbers for the first quarter to give a sense of how the merged entity would look.

As per an analysis by Jefferies, adjusted for the merger, HDFC Bank’s net profit declined by 2 percent sequentially against the reported 33 percent jump.

The biggest impact was on the net interest margin (NIM), which tumbled by a whopping 70 basis points sequentially to 3.4 percent, as against the 4 percent-level HDFC Bank has traditionally maintained.

HDFC Bank Q2 earnings growth: Is it 50, 10 or 6%? Here is the correct version

NIM - the difference between what banks offer depositors and what they charge for loans – is a key profitability metric for lenders.

One of the major reasons for the deteriorating margins was an increase in liquidity post the merger. When HDFC Bank absorbed HDFC’s loans, it had to increase its liquidity position to meet various regulatory guidelines like cash reserve ratio.

The bank said there was a “debt-funded cost for the additional liquidity and merger management” which was a drag on the NIMs during Q2.

“While we expect NIMs to see sequential improvement going ahead, as the impact of excess liquidity wanes out, it will be difficult to see pre-merger levels as lower-margin home loans of HDFC Ltd gets added to the loan portfolio,” domestic brokerage firm JM Financial said.

Another fallout of the merger was an uptick in its gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio to 1.34 percent from 1.17 percent in Q1 as about Rs 5,000 crore worth of HDFC’s loans were restructured and had to be labelled non-performing on the bank’s balance sheet.

The HDFC Bank stock has been a conspicuous underperformer ever since the merger was announced in April last year, dropping around 7 percent.

Investors, however, can still take heart from the fact that despite its merger-related pain, the analyst view on the company remains overwhelmingly positive.

Hamara Bajaj

Shrinking margins has claimed another high-profile victim this earnings season – Bajaj Finance.

Its net interest income growth of 30 percent lagged AUM expansion of 33 percent due to an 11 bps QoQ compression in NIMs to 10.5 percent.

“Moreover, management guided that margins may see another 25-30 bps compression as funding costs will rise and Bajaj Finance may not like to pass that on to clients. While this will be a drag on top line, Bajaj Finance has levers to slow opex growth… to mitigate impact on profit / ROA,” Jefferies added.

Bajaj Finance: Strong earnings growth, but sustainability is debatable

Other analysts pointed out that its NPA profile will be keenly tracked as it is already one of the most aggressive lenders in the NBFC space today and will have to maintain its scorching pace of growth to sustain its leadership position in the market.

However, as most finance sector professionals know only too well, lending is the easiest part for banks and NBFCs in India. The real challenge is to recover those loans.

Shareholders would be hoping this mad rush for growth does not result in laxity in the company’s credit appraisal process and subsequent deterioration in its asset quality.

Some parts of its book have started throwing up signs of stress.

Bajaj Finance’s gross stage-3 assets (or loans which have been overdue for more than 90 days) increased 5 bps QoQ to 0.9 percent, while the net stage- 3 was largely stable at 0.3 percent.

“Rural B2C exhibited minor stress, and the management has cut incremental business volumes in this segment to mitigate risk. It expects Rural B2C to remain muted until Feb’24 and recover subsequently,” Motilal Oswal said in a note.

Weighed by these lingering concerns, the Bajaj Finance counter closed in the red for two straight sessions after its results announcement.

In a report earlier this year, Elara Securities had described Bajaj Finance as an “elephant that continues to dance”. Investors would be praying it remains that way, because as we have seen, wounded elephants do not paint a pretty picture.

The future of IT companies will be heavily influenced by the commentary from the Federal Reserve

The results of major IT companies for the quarter ended September 2023 are out, and the report card is not looking good. India’s five largest IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Wipro and LTIMindtree — saw a muted quarter due to demand slowdown, macroeconomic headwinds and weak discretionary spending. Analysts don't see tailwinds for these companies in the near term, either.

While the management talk across companies has stressed how deal wins have been good and that they executed well in a tough environment, brokerages are of the view that most IT majors have not been able to convert deal wins into growth.

All five companies reported better-than-expected margins on account of cost-control measures, rationalising employee pyramid and efficiency improvements. However, this might not be a sign of sharp margin expansion in the near term. Additionally, the weak revenue guidance by Infosys, Wipro, HCL Tech does not inspire much confidence.

IT stocks fall after Q2 results disappoint

Following the subdued quarterly earnings, major IT stocks have seen a fall. While TCS share price has tanked over 5 percent since October 11, Infosys shares have declined around 4 percent since its results on October 12. HCL Technologies share price has remained largely unchanged. Wipro shares tumbled more than 4 percent on October 19, a day after the Bengaluru-based company reported its Q2 earnings.

LTIMindtree, however, gained more than 4 percent on October 19 as the company reported a better-than-expected margin. The EBIT margin was a “positive surprise”, according to brokerages. Despite weak discretionary spending, prevailing uncertainty and anticipated higher-than-usual furloughs in Q3, the management is confident of delivering a better performance in the second half of this fiscal.

""IT companies are expected to face ongoing challenges. The future of IT companies will be heavily influenced by the commentary from the Federal Reserve,"" said Shrikant Chouhan - Head - Equity Research, Kotak Securities. If someone is interested in taking a contrarian position in the IT sector, Infosys appears to be a more favourable option, he added.

Which IT stocks to buy?

After the release of the September quarter results for IT companies, brokerages' opinions remained varied. Infosys received predominantly positive ratings such as ‘Outperform’, ‘Overweight’, or ‘Buy’. However, target prices were cut due to concerns about margin pressures and a less robust revenue outlook.

In the case of TCS, HCL Technologies, and Wipro, brokerages have largely assigned ratings like ‘Hold’, ‘Reduce’, or ‘Equal Weight’ owing to a somewhat pessimistic outlook. In fact, some analysts even issued ‘Sell’ recommendations for Wipro and TCS. LTIMindtree, on the other hand, primarily received favourable recommendations, with ‘Buy’ or ‘Add’ calls from analysts.

The way ahead

The major theme emerging from the IT majors’ Q2 report card is that the macroeconomic conditions remain shaky. Elevated interest rates along with weak consumer sentiment in Western economies have led to a persistent slowdown in discretionary spends, leading to delays in decision-making as well as deal conversions.

Further, the AI theme that every IT major's management has talked about is unlikely to be a short-term game-changer. The positive effects of these efforts are anticipated to significantly influence outcomes in the medium to long term.

The Indian IT services Big Four, comprising Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech and Wipro, reported a decline in workforce by 21, 213 in the second quarter, mainly driven by a slowdown in hiring, focus on better utilisation, and use of the existing pool of trained freshers on projects, amid rising uncertainty on the demand front.

With the exception of HCLTech, which saw a plunge of 2,299 employees, the other three recorded the steepest decline in headcount in the range of over 5,000 in the September quarter.

As of the first half of FY24, all four companies cumulatively lost around 39,000 employees. This is a significant drop in headcount, compared to the first half of last fiscal, when these companies together added 81,650 people.

Among the other top Indian IT companies, LTIMindtree was an exception this quarter with the addition of around 794 employees in Q2 and the onboarding of 1,400 freshers.

Attrition rates meanwhile declined sequentially across the board, coming in the range of 14-16 percent. IT companies are trying to avoid backfilling this attrition immediately, as improving utilisation of the existing workforce continues to be a key lever to improve operating margins in the current business environment.

What do these companies say?

According to TCS Chief Human Resource Officer Milind Lakkad, the IT major has been heavily investing in getting fresh talent for nearly 18 months, and right now that is paying off. As the company is recalibrating hiring while the attrition rates have continued to drop, there appears to be a net reduction, he explained during the company’s Q2 earnings conference with analysts.

He expects the headcount shrinkage to continue in the coming quarters, though the numbers won’t be this high.

Wipro’s Chief Operating Officer Amit Choudhary said that his company is focusing on operational efficiency as its utilisation went up by almost 470 basis points in the last four quarters, touching 84.5 percent in Q2.

“We have taken several actions here from sustained bench reduction efforts, and pyramid optimisation to onshore-offshore rationalisation and rigour around subcontracting costs. We are also keeping a very close eye on discretionary spending with increased rigor on cost and efficiency management,” he said.

Infosys Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy said that the company hired ahead of demand, and with this theme of improving utilisation playing out, there’s more headroom to work on.

Infosys still has a significant fresher bench waiting to be onboarded. Consequently, the company will not be hitting the campuses this year. “At the moment, we are not going to the campuses. We will monitor this every quarter, looking at our future predictions and then finally decide when we do go back,” Roy said.

HCLTech, too, is shying away from 1fresh hiring for now, though it is on track in terms of its fresher addition targets, which is helping improve profitability, Chief Executive Officer C Vijayakumar said. “Our investments over the last few years on freshers have really started showing results, and that's visible in this quarter's profitability numbers.”

He added that a lot of freshers they hired over the last 18 months are now trained and deployed on projects in the last quarter. Hence, much of the attrition backfilling is happening by internally deploying these trained freshers, which will not reflect in net headcount numbers.

Fresher hiring targets

While Infosys and Wipro are skipping campus hiring this fiscal year, TCS and HCLTech continue to onboard freshers.

TCS plans to hire 40,000 freshers in FY24 and HCLTech will be adding 10,000 freshers. HCLTech, as of the first half of FY24, has hired about 5,200 freshers. TCS, however, has not shared these numbers on a quarterly basis this year.",616,-0.14716331826315987

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has ended work from home for most of its employees, making it mandatory for them to show up in office five days a week. For many who started working during the pandemic, working from office is in itself a new experience, and the IT giant is keen to facilitate their assimilation into the workforce. To that end, TCS has asked all employees to follow its dress code while working from office, Financial Express has reported.

In a recent mail to employees, Milind Lakkad, chief human resource officer at TCS, reminded associates to follow the dress code policy.

“This is key to creating the right impact with stakeholders globally. The dress code policy gives clear guidance on the right attire while carrying out official responsibilities and duties,” the email read.

“A large number of our associates have joined us in the last two years and have been working in a virtual or hybrid mode, and it is our responsibility to ensure they are well integrated – working from the office is key to internalise the TCS values and the TCS way,” it said. A copy of the email was seen by Gadgets Now.

Here is the dress code policy that all TCS associates are expected to follow as per the email:

Business casuals (Monday to Thursday)

Formal full-sleeved shirts tucked into formal trousers (solid colours, checked, striped shirts, etc)

Formal skirts or business dresses in neutral/solid colours

Saree or knee-length kurtas

Formal shoes, moccasins, flats, heels, pumps, dress sandals

Smart casuals (Friday)

Casual, half sleeved shirts, collared t-shirts, golf/polo shirts and turtlenecks

India’s largest IT services company, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has taken action against 19 employees and banned six staffing firms in relation to the bribe-for-job scandal after completing the investigation, a case which opened a can of worms on recruitment malpractices happening at an industry level in the IT sector.

TCS’ case first came into light on June 23, 2023, through media reports claiming that the IT services major had blacklisted three staffing firms that were involved in bribing senior executives overseeing recruitment processes in the Resource Management Group (RMG) of the company to get business. While the investigation was underway, there were speculations that four employees too were immediately sacked.

A few internal names that came up include ES Chakravarthy, the global head of RMG who was sent on leave. Arun GK, who had headed one of the functions in the team, was one of the four other employees sacked.

On the same day, TCS clarified through exchange filings that recruitment activities in TCS were not directly handled by the RMG. Instead, RMG was only responsible for allocating available resources on various projects in case of talent shortfall, and it would fill in such positions through contractors.

Here’s a primer on all you need to know about this case:

What TCS chairman N Chandrasekaran has said

On June 29, during the company’s annual general meeting, TCS chairman N Chandrasekaran detailed how the issue unfolded for the senior management at the company.

At that time, the investigation was still on and Chandrasekaran had said that around six employees were then found to be not following ethical conduct. He added that the company couldn’t “quantify what favours they got but they certainly behaved in a way that they were favouring certain firms.”

TCS had also started examining its entire business associates (BA) supply management process to determine weaknesses and clean up the hiring process.

What transpired behind the scenes and TCS’ findings?

According to Chandrasekaran, the senior management was first alerted about the wrongdoings by two whistleblowers in February and March 2023.

“The complaints were about certain favouritism done and favours received in the recruitment of business associates,” he had said.

The whistleblowers informed the company’s CEO K Krithivasan and COO Natarajan Ganapathy Subramaniam. TCS immediately started running an internal investigation into these charges.

Based on the initial findings, TCS had earlier said that the issue relates to ""breach of Company’s Code of Conduct by certain employees and vendors providing contractors; and no key managerial person of the Company has been found to be involved.""

The company ultimately found two similar cases, one in India and the other in the US. The India cased was investigated by a senior executive within the company while the US one was conducted by an external official.

How does TCS work with staffing firms?

TCS uses two departments to acquire and deploy talent. The HR and talent acquisition team is the main department hiring employees and then there is a resource allocation group that deploys available resources on projects or sources talent from staffing firms. In the case of talent shortage or a particular skill requirement at a given location, the company would use a set of staffing firms to get contract employees.

But Chandrasekaran explained that at any given point, employees hired on a contractual basis from such staffing firms would account for only 2-3 percent of the overall deployment of resources.

There’s in fact a large pool of staffing firms which TCS works with. These firms had to go through a rigorous process and checks to qualify to work with TCS.

“There are about a little over 1,000 such firms globally because we need resources in 55 such countries. And each one of them does a certain amount of business depending on their skill availability,” Chandrasekaran said.",649,-0.9895241657892863

Sixteen employees were sacked and six firms were disbarred by Tata Consultancy Services after the IT major's investigation into the bribes-for-jobs scandal, the company said in an exchange filing on October 15.

The investigation closure report comes months after the company looked into practices where staffing firms were allegedly involved in bribing senior executives overseeing recruitment processes in the company to get business.

It took action against 19 employees in total -- 16 of whom were sacked and three removed from the function.

""Our investigation found 19 employees to be involved and action has been taken against all as detailed here - 16 employees have been separated from the Company for code of conduct violations, and 3 employees have been removed from the Resource Management function,"" TCS said in an exchange filing.

It added that six vendor entities, their owners and affiliates have been debarred from doing any business with the company.

The company further said it would continue to enhance its governance measures by regular rotation of personnel performing key roles in the Resource Management function, enhanced analytics on supplier management, periodic declarations by vendors on compliance to the Tata Code of Conduct and know-your-supplier process to cover additional declarations, and vendor management process audits.

The company maintained that it does not involve fraud against the company and there is no financial impact, and that no key managerial person was involved.

In the press conference held after the company announced its second quarter results, Chief Executive Officer K Krithivasan said that the firm had take ""appropriate action"".

“We have completed our investigation. We have taken appropriate action against whosoever we believe violated our code of conduct. Actions differ based on the kind of violation but all actions have been taken and it's closed,” the CEO said.

When asked about what steps the company was taking to ensure this doesn't happen again during the company's Q2 earnings conference on October 11, Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said the company was looking into organisational, people, process and technological aspects but did not comment on specifics.

Tata Sons N Chandrasekaran had told shareholders at the annual general meeting that he could not quantify what favours they got, but the employees in question ""certainly behaved in a way that they were favouring certain firms.""

How it unfolded?

The case first came into light on June 23, 2023, when TCS in its stock exchange filings, following a whistleblower complaint, said that the RMG (Resource Management Group) didn’t handle any recruitment activities for TCS and that it was only responsible for allocation of available resources to various projects and incase of any shortfall, fill such requirements through contractors.

Later during the company’s AGM on June 29, TCS’ chairman N Chandrasekaran had said that the company had already started investigating, sacking six employees and staffing firms.

How TCS works with staffing firms?

Chandrasekaran had detailed that TCS uses two departments for acquiring talent: the HR and talent acquisition, which hires people and the resource allocation group which deploys available resources into projects. In the case of talent shortage or a need for a particular skill that is not available in a location, the company has a set of BA firms (business associate firms or staffing firms) to get contract employees.

“At any point in time in the overall deployment of resources, about 2-3 percent of them are such BAs or contractors. The complaint was related to certain individuals in the company working with certain BA firms to be recruiting in their favour,” Chandrasekaran explained.

He added, “There are a large number of BA firms that TCS works with. There is a rigorous process in the company to recruit or qualify a firm to be called a BA firm. There are about a little over 1,000 such firms globally because we need resources in 55 such countries.

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCS

TCS reported revenue of USD7.2b (-0.2% QoQ) in 2QFY24, up 0.1% QoQ in constant currency (CC) and below our estimate of 1.1% CC QoQ. Revenue growth was affected by continued slowdown across key verticals (BFSI/Retail) and geographies (US/Europe). The weakness in revenue growth was majorly led by continued slowdown in discretionary spends and clients reprioritizing cost optimization projects. However, the deal momentum remained strong as TCS recorded the second-highest ever deal TCV of USD11.2b in 2Q, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.6x. 2Q EBIT margin improved by 110bp to 24.3% due to the recalibration of gross hiring, which led to a sharp drop in headcount by ~6.3k, coupled with incremental measures to rationalize the pyramid and optimize subcon expenses in 2Q. The management has suggested that it has further scope for improvement in utilization and productivity as freshers are deployed and repurposed into projects.

Outlook

We have trimmed our FY24/FY25 EPS estimates by 0.7%/1.8%. Our TP of INR4,060 implies 28x FY25E EPS (12% upside). Reiterate BUY on the stock.

India’s largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has said it has more than 250 generative AI opportunities in the pipeline and completed training over 100,000 employees in the field, which has emerged as the new tech frontier with global giants racing to grab the biggest share of the pie.

Speaking at TCS’ Q2 earnings conference on October 11, CEO and MD K Krithivasan said generative AI had caught everyone’s attention. ""At our customer summit, everyone was talking generative AI as a key theme and how they are trying to leverage it for new product and services. Given that there is an overhang of economic uncertainties, there are discussions around how do you optimise projects, is there an opportunity to consolidate operating model transformation?”

COO N Ganapathy Subramaniam said the company was making investments in people and new technologies. ""We now have a 100,000-strong pool of Gen-AI Ready consultants and prompt-engineers who are engaged in hundreds of Gen-AI projects for our clients across segments,” he said.

The Mumbai-headquartered tech major launched its AI.Cloud unit in the July-September quarter, bringing together TCS’ three hyperscale-dedicated cloud units and specialists in data sciences and AI/machine learning.

“Cloud migration, composite data foundation, application modernization, workplace transformation and edge to cloud, coupled with AI adoption frameworks continued to drive growth in Q2,” the company said in a statement.

TCS reported a net profit of Rs 11,342 crore for the September quarter, growing 8.7 percent YoY, driven by a strong order book, especially in the BFSI segment.

Information technology major Tata Consultancy Services' lower-than-expected revenue for the July-September quarter turned out to be a sour pill for brokerages, more so because deal wins still remained strong. Most brokerage firms now await to see the strong deal wins translate into revenue growth, however a few expect it to be pushed on to FY25, dragged by the weak macro environment.

""The second half of FY24 is unlikely to see a V-shaped recovery for TCS as bulk of the benefit of ramp-up of large deals will only be visible in FY25,"" brokerage firm HSBC stated in its report.

Bernstein also agrees as it feels the strong deal wins for TCS set the platform for growth in FY25. Nomura also shares similar views and believes that the near-term visibility for TCS remains low despite its orderbook holding up.

Adding to the list, Motilal Oswal Financial Services also pegged its growth expectations from TCS from FY25. ""We continue to expect TCS to deliver superior growth in FY25 driven by its leadership in cost efficiency, which has led to strong deal inflows in recent quarters,"" the firm stated.

Regardless, TCS' sequential rise in margins came as a positive surprise for most brokerages. MOFSL feels TCS should benefit from its scale and ability to optimise talent to control costs in the near-to-medium term, with a sharp recovery in its EBIT margin performance.

On the other hand, Morgan Stanley forecasted limited EPS cuts for TCS, thanks to its margin beat in Q2.

However, Nomura still doesn't feel optimistic about the company managing to deliver a 25-percent EBIT margin in FY24. TCS reported an EBIT margin of 24.3 percent in the September quarter, up from 23.2 percent in the previous one.

Moreover, the IT major also announced a buyback plan worth Rs 17,000 crore at Rs 4,150 a piece, reflecting a 15 premium to the Wednesday closing price. Bernstein also expects this buyback to provide near-term support to the stock.

In conclusion, despite another quarter of sluggish revenue growth for TCS, most brokerages - Goldman Sachs, Nuvama Institutional Equities, Bernstein, and MOFSL - have retained their bullish ratings on the stock. Others such as HSBC, Nomura, and Citi have maintained some caution.

Target price for the stock, as assigned by eight brokerages, varies in the range of Rs 3,030-4,120, reflecting a 15 percent downside to a 16 percent upside potential.

In effect, 70 percent of the company’s workforce will receive the full variable payout. The variable payout for the remaining employees is based on business unit performance.

“We are going to have 100% variable pay for 70% of our workforce. The rest of the workforce will get paid based on the business unit performance,” Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said.

The company had paid out 100 percent of the variable pay in Q1FY24 as well. TCS’ peers Infosys and Wipro rolled out 80 percent variable pay in Q1. The company also completed its wage hike in Q1, while it has been delayed for companies such as Infosys, Wipro, and HCLTech.

TCS saw a decline in headcount of over 6,000 personnel in Q2FY24, which it attributed to the investments in talent it has made previously, and is now looking at improving utilisation and productivity.

Attrition on the wane

Lakkad told the press that there is reduced attrition and that the company has recalibrated its hiring numbers leading to the decline in headcount from the end of last quarter.

Attrition has been on a downward trajectory, coming in at 14.9 percent on the last-twelve-months basis, down from last quarter’s 17.8 percent.

“Our strategy of proactively hiring bright freshers and investing in training them with the right skills is paying off.

The brokerage has a hold call on the stock with a target price of Rs 3,450.

The company saw revenue decline in five of the seven verticals, the brokerage report, post the earnings announcement stated. While Communication (+2.3% QoQcc) and Regional Markets (+3.8% QoQcc) drove growth, tech (-1.6% QoQcc), Lifesciences (-0.9% QoQcc) and Manufacturing vertical (-0.7% QoQcc) impacted growth. Revenue decline in North America (-0.7 percent QoQcc) for a third straight quarter also impacted growth, according to them.

A strong decline in the headcount—falling by 6,400 QoQ—which was the highest quarterly decline in a decade “raises doubts on near-term demand and 2H recovery”.

Analysts noted the drag on growth from revenue leakage, calling attention to the management commentary.

“Management highlighted that while the company is able to sign large deals and the new projects are ramping up on time, revenue leakage from existing projects due to deferrals or ramp downs is impacting revenue growth. Furthermore, Management highlighted that the demand sentiment has not changed and clients remain cautious. However, management highlighted that clients' willingness for longer term deals and their appetite to experiment with GenAI and other new technologies provides confidence on longer term growth,” they stated.

The company’s margin expansion was driven by 35bps savings in employee costs and 50bps improvement in subcontracting costs. “Management highlighted that focus on productivity improvements has driven margin improvement despite flattish revenues.

This marked a shift in work-from-home policies for the IT sector, signalling a return to pre-pandemic style of work.

The reason for this, according to the CHRO, is that a large number of people who have joined the company in the last three years have either worked virtually or in a hybrid manner.

“We strongly believe that they need to come to work so that the new workforce gets integrated with the larger workforce of TCS. That is the only way they will learn, understand, and internalize TCS values and the TCS way,” Lakkad said.

Employees were asked to return to work 5 days a week starting October, and Moneycontrol previously reported that emails were sent out to various units.

This is also a change in policy for the company, which, since September 2022, had asked employees to come into the office three days a week and mandated that they adhere to a roster. Lakkad has also previously said that while working from home was more convenient for everybody, there were drawbacks to the system.

Chief Operating Officer NG Subramaniam said on October 11 that the company has been advising its employees to work from the office, and are realising its advantages.

“People feel that it is better to be in the office. About 70 percent of our employees have started to come to office at this stage which is a very good thing. Given the large-scale hiring that we did and the kind of attrition that we experienced…we believe that it is advisable to get everybody back to the office at this stage, which is the need of the hour for TCS,” NGS said.

“The TCS way of working, the membership that they experience and the kind of interactions that one typically has in a collective with customers, these things are not taught anywhere. These things are observed and learned and it's better in a collective workplace,” he added.

This is at odds with the company’s previously announced 25x25 plan. In 2020, under former chief executive officer Rajesh Gopinathan, the company had announced its plan where, by 2025, only 25 percent of its associates will need to work out of its facilities at any point of time. Also, it believes employees will not need to spend more than 25 percent of their time at work.

In response, the COO said that it can be said that for now, this plan is defocused and it’s not necessary that the company will adhere to this plan.

“The important thing is do we have the right systems processes and procedures to adapt ourselves to the needs of things? Our focus is to get everybody back to office, and for that the people who have joined us in the last two years or three years get the full feel of TCS. I think that's more important,” he said.

According to CHRO Lakkad, the company will assess its future work models as they go forward but did not commit to anything. “We will adopt based on what works for our employees and our customers,” he said.",583,0.519460117816925

Tata Consultancy Services’ (TCS) performance during the second quarter of the fiscal year 2024 was lauded by analysts, who expect the company’s outlook to be positive. However, they believe it is not enough to attract new investors to stocks.

TCS reported a 9 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended September 2023 to Rs 11,342 crore. Consolidated revenue grew nearly 8 percent YoY to Rs 59,692 crore.

“TCS reported Q2 earnings that met street expectations while the buyback price was below expectations and even below the last buyback price,” said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities. “US Dollar revenue declined for the first time in many quarters while Q2 EBIT Margin was better than expectations.”

Tapse believes that reacting to Q2 numbers and the buyback announcement, there is a high probability of a neutral to negative opening for the TCS stock tomorrow morning.

Its EBIT margin for the quarter increased to 24.3 percent compared to 23.2 percent (QoQ). The dollar revenue for the IT major stood at $7,210 million. The company’s numbers were driven by a strong order book, especially in the BFSI segment, despite a tough business environment.

Sequentially, PAT beat estimates but rupee revenue growth came in below estimates. In dollar terms, the revenue declined by 0.2 percent from the previous quarter to $7.2 billion.

“TCS’ Q2FY24 result demonstrates a promising outlook for the company's sustained growth. Notably, TCS has secured a substantial order book, registering its second-highest TCV in a quarter. Efforts to boost employee utilisation, enhance productivity and improve cost efficiency have led to an impressive QoQ growth in operating margin,” said Dhruv Mudaraddi, Research Analyst, StoxBox.

The company’s order book at the end of Q2FY24 stood at $11.2 billion, in line with analyst estimates of $11-13 billion and the book-to-bill ratio stood at 1.6. The order book is higher than the $10.2 billion TCV it had in the previous quarter. The EBIT margin or the operating margin was up to 24.3 percent, an expansion from 23.2 percent in the previous quarter as the company recovered from the wage hike cycle in the April-June period.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported a strong order book of $11.2 billion for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. The IT services major won some of the largest deals in the sector this quarter, beating macroeconomic challenges and surpassing its own quarterly deal win guidance of $7-9 billion.

This is the third consecutive quarter that TCS reported over $10 billion in order book. TCS also updated and increased its quarterly order book guidance to $9-10 billion.

The total contract value (TCV) for Q2 was up by 38.27 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis as compared to $8.1 billion reported in Q2FY23. Last quarter, TCV stood at $10.2 billion.

The growth was driven by the UK market which grew at about 10.7 percent YoY in constant currency (CC) terms. Among major markets, North America grew 0.1 percent and Continental Europe grew 1.3 percent. In emerging markets, Middle East & Africa grew 15.9 percent, India grew 3.9 percent, Latin America grew 13.1 percent, and Asia Pacific grew 4.1 percent.

Key segments like banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) saw a slowdown in YoY growth in constant currency terms, declining 0.5 percent YoY, Communications & Media declined 2.1 percent, Technology & Services declined 2.2 percent, manufacturing grew 5.8 percent QoQ, Life Sciences and Healthcare which grew 5 percent and – showing signs of continued pressure in these segments especially BFSI and communication.

TCS also saw several multi-year deal renewals and extensions happening this quarter, including a deal with the BBC, Georgia’s Unemployment insurance system, GE HealthCare Technologies and a $1 billion five-year deal from Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), to name a few.

The company is also seeing strong demand coming from generative AI offerings, reporting a pipeline of over 250 generative AI opportunities. TCS has also completed training for over 100,000 employees in generative AI capabilities.

K Krithivasan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, said: “Our clients continue to entrust us with critical new technology initiatives, and large programs to digitally transform their IT and business operating models. Strong deal momentum delivered us a very large order book in Q2 – our second highest TCV ever in a quarter, and a good pipeline.”

“The resilience of demand for our services, our clients’ willingness to commit to long tenure programs and their continued appetite for experimentation with Gen AI and other new technologies give us confidence in our longer-term growth prospects.”

TCS gets over $1 billion from BSNL deal

TCS confirmed that it will be clocking in over $1 billion in total contract value from the BSNL 4G roll out deal, which it bagged in a consortium with other companies including telecom gear maker Tejas Networks.

This deal was also included in the Q2 TCV of $11.2 billion.

""BSNL is little over a billion dollars plus for us, there will be other which will come eventually. We don’t give break ups on what is for us and what is for others. But it is important to recognise that it’s a very large and complex deal,"" TCS COO N Ganapathy Subramaniam said.

According to the company's statement, BSNL had selected TCS to roll out a modern 4G and 5G mobile communication infrastructure across India covering 100K telecom sites. The project involves supply, planning, design, installation and commissioning, and optimization of this mobile network, satisfying a detailed set of requirements conforming to 3GPP standards.

""TCS and its partners have integrated the EPC Core, RAN and NMS and have started the roll-out of the network which is expected to be completed in stages over the next 18 months,"" the company said in the release.",615,0.7499990463256836

India’s largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) saw its headcount decline by 6,333 employees on a net basis in the second quarter of FY24, the company said while announcing its results for the quarter.

Last quarter, the firm added 523 employees. In a release, the company said the decline in headcount reflects “the company’s focus on improving workforce utilization and productivity.”

In a statement, Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said the company’s strategy to hire freshers and train them is paying off.

“Our strategy of proactively hiring bright freshers and investing in training them with the right skills is paying off. With that talent coming on stream and with reduced attrition, we were able to recalibrate our gross additions, keeping it below the departures during the quarter, driving up productivity and enhancing project outcomes,” he said.

Speaking to mediapersons, Lakkad said they have been investing heavily in talent in the last few quarters, which has been paying off.

""There is reduced attrition. We have recalibrated our hiring numbers, and as a result, our total hiring is less than our attrition this quarter, and hence the negative number,"" he said.

He added that the company will continue to onboard trainees as it did in the quarter gone by, and will honour all offers. ""The number of how many we get them every quarter depends on the business situation,"" he said.

In Q1FY24, TCS was the only one among the IT majors to add to its headcount, while all others saw a decline as they looked to increase utilisation in an uncertain and tough macroeconomic climate. There were few green shoots in the past quarter, and it is expected that IT majors will report a decline in headcount. Wage bills are some of the biggest expenditures for IT services companies, and they are now looking to utilise the talent they have.

With the headcount decline, the company’s headcount stood at 608,985 as of September 30, 2023.

Attrition numbers also continued their downward trend, coming in at 14.9 percent on the last-twelve-months basis, down from last quarter’s 17.8 percent.

Net addition and hiring has slowed to a crawl across the industry, and is not an isolated phenomenon at TCS.

In the same quarter last year, TCS had added 9,840 employees.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has announced a share buyback for Rs 17,000 crore at a price of Rs 4,150 a share on October 11. The buyback price is at a premium of about 15 percent to the prevailing price.

The stock ended 0.44 percent down at Rs 3,613 on October 11, ahead of the company’s earnings release.

The company will be buying up to 4,09,63,855 shares representing 1.12 percent of the total equity. The buyback size does not include transaction costs, applicable taxes and other incidental and related expenses.

This is the fifth share buyback by India’s largest information technology services company in the last six years. The company bought Rs 66,000 crore worth of shares in four such exercises.

TCS bought back its shares for the first time in February 2017. It bought shares worth Rs 16,000 crore at an 18 percent premium to the prevailing price. This was followed by two buybacks of Rs 16,000-crore each in June 2018 and October 2020, at an 18 and 10 percent premium, respectively.

The last time the IT major bought back shares from holders was in January 2022 at a premium of 17 percent a piece, buying shares worth Rs 18,000 crore.

TCS' 2023 buyback price is lower than the previous buyback price of Rs 4,500.

""The buyback is subject to approval of the shareholders by means of a special resolution through a postal ballot,"" TCS said in an exchange filing.

Analysts expect that the softness observed in the past two quarters will continue, even as the company secured significant orders in recent months, as profit realisation will require time.

TCS is expected to post a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 11,420 crore, a marginal 3.2 percent increase quarter-on-quarter, according to average estimates of five brokers. As for revenue, it is slated to increase by 1.5 percent to Rs 60,270 crore in the second quarter.

Elara Capital, a domestic brokerage firm, suggests that tepid spending in North America and the impact on old managed services deals may dampen momentum. North America is a major customer for the IT giant.

""The large deal win rate around vendor consolidation may determine TCS' position in growth leadership, with the key risk being any revenue leakage or project cancellations related to discretionary projects"" added the brokerage firm.

Along with its second quarter earnings on October 11, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is set to announce its fifth share buyback in six years, rewarding investors with the increasing cash in its reserves.

Before this, TCS has bought back its shares in 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2022. The IT behemoth, valued at over Rs 13 lakh crore, has bought back shares worth Rs 66,000 crore in the last six years.

In a share buyback, a company buys back shares from its shareholders, usually at a premium to prevailing prices, giving shareholders the option to fully or partly exit a stock at a profit. A buyback signals the management’s confidence in its business.

Earlier buybacks

TCS bought back its shares for the first time in 2017. The company announced a buyback worth Rs 16,000 crore in February 2017 at an 18 percent premium to prevailing prices. This was followed by two buybacks of Rs 16,000 crore each in June 2018 and October 2020, at an 18 and 10 percent premium, respectively. The last buyback was announced in January 2022. The company decided to buy shares worth Rs 18,000 crore at a premium of 17 percent.

A buyback also indicates how a company sees its fair value (the buyback price). More often than not, the stock price eventually moves in that direction. However, such movements have been slower than expected in case of TCS.

It took 228 sessions, or nearly a year, for TCS’s stock price to top the buyback price announced in 2017. Following the 2018 buyback, it took 69 sessions for the same, and after the 2020 buyback, it took 61 sessions. But TCS’s stock is yet to breach the 2022 buyback price of Rs 4,500. The scrip hit an all-time high of Rs 4,019.10 on January 17, 2023, just five days after the buyback announcement, but has moved downhill since.

Thus, it can be seen that a buyback announcement is no guarantee that the stock will outperform in the following period. Morgan Stanley in its note on the buyback announcement shares this analysis.

The 2023 buyback

As of June 30, 2023, TCS had cash and cash equivalent of Rs 7,123 crore on its balance sheet. This is likely to go higher given its track record of generating more than Rs 10,000 crore in cash from its operations during a quarter.

Extrapolating from trends and market expectations, the 2023 buyback is likely to be around Rs 18,000 crore. It will be interesting to see the premium it offers as the previous buyback price (Rs 4,500) is 24 percent higher than its current price.

JP Morgan said it expects a buyback size of Rs 18,000 crore, while Morgan Stanley pegs it between Rs 18,000 and 22,500 crore. IIFL sees it being between Rs 18,000 and 20,000 crore.

Other buybacks and taxability

In the past, buybacks by TCS have usually been followed by similar announcements by other major IT firms, especially Infosys and Wipro. For instance, in the last seven years, Wipro has bought back shares worth Rs 45,499 crore from shareholders in five tranches. Similarly, Infosys has bought Rs 39,760 crore worth of shares in the last six years over four instances. Understandably, investors will be hoping for these companies to follow suit and announce their buybacks.

A buyback is one of the most tax efficient ways to reward shareholders, as profits on tendering shares during a buyback are tax-free unlike when it's sold in open market. This is the reason even promoter groups participate extensively in buybacks. Dividends, on the other hand, are taxed in the hands of investors at their respective slab rate, which can be as high as 37 percent for high earners.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is set to kick-start the IT sector earnings season for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 on October 11.

This was a crucial quarter for the IT services bellwether, given the internal restructuring of its verticals and new vertical head appointments -– the first major leadership rejig under new CEO K Krithivasan.

While there were strong deal wins, especially among the top three IT companies --- TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech -- analysts expect the quarter that ended in September 30, 2023, to remain muted amidst the uncertainty in demand and continued caution on discretionary spending.

Analysts expect EBIT margins for most IT companies, including TCS, to improve this quarter as its wage hike cycle impact was taken in Q1. TCS is likely to see an improvement of 50-60 bps, touching an estimated 23.6 percent, according to CNBC-TV18’s poll.

Here are the five themes to watch out for in TCS’ Q2 performance:

Revenue growth

According to CNBC-TV18’s estimate poll, rupee revenue growth on a QoQ basis is expected to come in at 1.3 percent at Rs 60,160 crore, compared to Rs 59,381 crore in Q1.

Profit after tax (PAT) is estimated to be up by 0.8 percent QoQ at Rs 11,162 crore. Like the previous couple of quarters, this quarter, too, will remain subdued. All eyes will be on the management commentary on whether the worst is behind.

“We forecast marginal revenue growth due to persisting weakness in discretionary spends across several verticals,” said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities.

Demand outlook

TCS reported some of the largest new deals in 2023 as well as multi-year renewals with existing clients. Some of the major deals from the last quarter include the $1 billion deal from Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and a $1.1 billion deal from the UK’s workplace pension scheme NEST. Driven by these numbers, analysts estimate TCS’ order book for Q2 to come in the range of $11-13 billion, up from the company’s guidance of $7-9 billion.

According to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities, the management’s commentary on the revival of discretionary spending, outlook on macroeconomic challenges, cost takeout and vendor consolidation deal pipeline, geographic trends, especially in North America, and the impact of GCC ramp-ups will be looked into.

Sectoral trends

According to analysts at ICICI Securities, TCS gets nearly 53 percent of its overall revenue from sectors like BFSI, retail and telecom, which “continue to see macro pressures and have consequently slashed their discretionary spends while putting older projects under greater scrutiny.”

While deal flows have steadied, analysts believe growth will not be very democratic and will depend on a mix of verticals, services and the company’s ability to win large deals amidst exposure to affected customers.

A lot of the deals this quarter have also seen customers increasingly looking for embedded artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI elements into it. Hence, IT companies, too, are aggressively betting on these features to win deals. For instance, TCS started a unit called TCS AI Cloud, combining all its public cloud units and Al initiatives.

Return to offices

Last month, TCS sparked off an industry-wide debate after it decided to end work from home, making it compulsory for certain teams to be in offices for five days a week. The IT sector major employs over 600,000 people, signalling an end to the work-from-home era for the IT industry in India.

This could lead to an increase in overhead costs on the campuses, and a fear of near-term increase in attrition as angry employees may consider resigning. The management’s views on this and how it is assessing the situation will be important.

Earlier, under former CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, TCS had announced its 25X25 vision. As per the model, by 2025, only 25 percent of its associates will need to work out of facilities at any point of time. Also, employees will not need to spend more than 25 percent of their time at work.

Hiring slowdown

A direct reflection of slowing demand in the sector was the significant reduction in quarterly net headcount addition. In Q1, TCS was the only company to have a positive net addition of 523 people. Four out of the five IT majors in India, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and LTIMindtree, reported a fall in headcount in Q1FY24, with the total numbers plunging by over 20,000 as compared to the same quarter last fiscal year.

TCS was also the only IT company to share its fresher hiring target of 40,000 for FY24. Any change or update in these plans will be closely monitored. TCS, however, had delayed onboarding of lateral hires by three months due to project commencement delays. CHRO Milind Lakkad had said last quarter that all of these offers will be honoured.",808,-0.35718586353155285

The Indian stock markets remained resilient in the wake of the Israel-Hamas conflict on Monday, without witnessing any panic sell-offs. However, the intensifying dispute in the Middle East has shifted attention toward various Indian companies that have operations in Israel or are otherwise exposed to the war-hit country.

Shares of Sun Pharma are likely to be weighed down as its subsidiary Taro Pharmaceuticals is an Israel-based company. Taro Pharma has stated that terrorist acts could result in disruptions to its business. Other Pharma majors like Dr Reddy’s, Lupin, and Torrent Pharma also have an exposure to Israel on account of exports.

Adani Ports, which operates the Haifa port in Israel is also under pressure, with the stock falling nearly 5 percent on October 9. The Gautam Adani-led group firm said it is closely monitoring the action on ground and is prepared with a business continuity plan. The overall contribution of Haifa in APSEZ’s numbers is relatively small at 3 percent of the total cargo volume.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has several big-ticket projects, including government ones, in Israel. The IT major has over 1,000 employees in the country, and is closely monitoring the safety of its employees currently stranded in Israel, it said.

Oil marketing companies (OMC) including Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited remain in the spotlight as escalated geopolitical tension can lead to crude oil supply disruption from the Middle East.

Price impact

The Israel-Palestine crisis may lead to a sharp rebound in crude prices and related stocks including ONGC, Oil India, Mahanagar Gas, Reliance Industries. Castrol India, which manufactures and markets automotive and industrial lubricants, may see some movement.

When crude oil prices go up, the paints sector gets badly hit as crude oil derivatives are the main ingredients used in making paints. These companies have no control over these input prices. The Israel-Hamas war has the potential to keep crude oil prices higher for longer, and this would be unfavourable for companies like Asian Paints, Berger Paints, IndiGo Paints, Kansai Nerolac Paints.

Companies like NMDC, Kalyan Jewellers, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, and Wipro, with operations in Israel, could also see impacts on their market performance.

As companies gear up with their second quarter results in FY24 which is about to start with TCS on October 11, Kunal Shah, Senior Research Analyst at Carnelian Capital talked about large IT companies should benefit from the amount of deal wins they have announced in the last couple of months. In a conversation with Moneycontrol, Shah also shares his views about FMCG, new-age companies and banks.

Shah said the deal wins have come back, which was reflected in TCS and other large companies announcing big deal wins in the last few months. He added that TCV (Total Contract Value) growth along with revenue growth in Constant Currency (CC) is a key metric for these companies. He said the midcap IT companies have reported robust growth with most of them near their 52-week highs. “It’s time for large-cap IT companies to start joining the midcap companies,"" he said.

FMCG companies have been facing some muteness as rural sales are not picking up for them, Shah said. He added that the muteness will continue for a while and said to watch how the rural economy picks up.

Shah said they have been watchful of the new-age companies due to their expensive valuations. “ So far, we have avoided them because of the valuations and the cash flow that these companies have been generating, not to say that these companies are probably not going to do good in the medium term to long term,” he added.

Regarding Banks, Shah said the high interest rates would force most people to shift their money from CASA (Current account and Savings account) towards term deposits. He added that this will result in a couple of quarters, the pre-provisioning operating profit (PPoP) coming in line with the loan growth of most banks which has been robust.

“Not to say that the operating expenses are not going to be growing because everybody is in an expansion mode, but still the PPoP growth, probably one quarter down the line should be in lines with the loan growth and the pressure should kind of settle down in a quarter or so”, he added. Shah also said the Net Interest Margin (NIM) for mid sized banks will normalize in the coming quarter as their asset side has been repriced.

Tata Consultancy Services will consider buyback of equity shares. TCS board will meet on October 11, 2023 to consider the decision, the company said in a statement. Ahead of the buyback announcement, TCS shares ended nearly 1 percent higher at Rs 3,621.25 on NSE.

As of June 2023, TCS had a cash balance of Rs 15,622 crore, and the IT major is debt free.

TCS launched its last share buyback in the year 2022 when the IT major bought back shares worth Rs 18,000 crore. The issue size comprised of 4 crore shares priced at Rs 4,500 apiece with face value of Re 1 per share.

Analysts expect TCS to deliver sequential growth in profit after tax (PAT), revenue. In terms of margin performance, it is expected to outperform other tier-1 peers. Since the company has announced multiple large cost take-out deals, it is likely to result in robust total contract value (TCV) bookings for TCS.

In the previous quarter, TCS reported a nearly 17 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 11,074 crore. Its consolidated revenue increased nearly 13 percent YoY to Rs 59,381 crore.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has been selected by the labour department of the American state of Georgia to transform its 1980s-era legacy platform with cloud-based unemployment insurance system, India’s biggest IT services player said on October 5.

The company didn’t disclose the tenure and size of the deal, which, it said, would ensure eligible individuals receive prompt financial assistance and the claims process is streamlined.

“Digitised processes with automated workflows will enable faster processing of claims with reduced errors,” the company said. Advanced security features embedded in the new platform would help prevent fraud, save taxpayer dollars and ensure that benefits reach those in genuine need.

TCS bagged the deal on its track record of having helped several American states manage the exponential increase in unemployment claims during the coronavirus pandemic, including the integration of the Federal Government’s Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.

So far, the Indian company has transformed legacy unemployment insurance systems of Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New York and Wyoming.

In its partnership with Georgia, TCS will build a human-centric design of the new web-based platform making it convenient for Georgians to apply for unemployment insurance benefits, securely upload documents, check the status of their claims, and receive important updates.

There was an unprecedented surge in unemployment claims in Georgia during the pandemic – the third highest in the nation – straining the state's aging 40-year-old unemployment system and underscoring the urgent need for change.

Bruce Thompson, Commissioner, Georgia Department of Labor said a modern and responsive unemployment system minimizes claims processing times, enhances the customer experience, prevents fraud, and positions GDOL to become the most transparent and responsive agency in state government.

“In state after state, TCS has demonstrated how to leverage cutting-edge technology to improve accessibility, resilience, scalability, and transparency, significantly strengthening the critical safety net that unemployment insurance represents,” Robert Kane, Chief Commercial Officer, US Public Services, TCS added.

IT services major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is likely to end hybrid work from October 1, 2023. In an internal email, the company asked its workforce to attend office for five days a week, signalling a ongoing shift in work-from-home policies for the IT sector which employs over five million Indians.

To be sure, this transition mandate still continues to remain three days a week, but according to Moneycontrol’s sources, managers in various divisions have been nudging employees to come in to office five times a week. The company will however retain flexibility/hybrid policies and make exceptions wherever necessary.

An internal email accessed by CNBC-TV18, however, said, ""As communicated by CEO and chief human resources officer (CHRO) in various townhalls, it is mandatory for all associates to attend office on all the working days (5 days per week if there are no holidays) starting 1 October 2023.""

This is a marked shift from TCS' previous stance, which, since September 2022, has required employees to adhere to a roster and be in office three days a week. It had also warned employees of consequences if they did not adhere to this roster.

The email has not gone out to all teams, and is being staggered, according to sources.

TCS declined to comment on Moneycontrol's queries stating that the company is in the ""silent period at the moment.""

The company has previously also received flak, after Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said in a Q&A in the company’s annual report that attrition of women was higher when compared to men in FY23.

“Historically, women’s attrition at TCS has been similar or lower than men’s attrition, so this is unusual. There might be other reasons but intuitively, I would think working from home during the pandemic reset the domestic arrangements for some women, keeping them from returning to office even after everything normalised,” Lakkad said.

As of quarter ended June 30, TCS had around 615,318 employees. In the company's FY23 annual report, Lakkad said, over half the workforce today was hired after March 2020.

""Work from home is definitely more convenient for everybody, but there were drawbacks. Tenured employees who are well networked within the organization can work effectively and even collaborate virtually using the social capital built up over the years. That isn’t the case with more junior employees,"" Lakkad said.

He added, ""New employees get acculturated through physical interactions with senior colleagues and leaders, by observing and following their behaviors and ways of thinking. Without those interactions, employee engagement as well as acculturation got badly impacted. All these factors led us to gradually bring back people to our offices during the year.""

Gopinathan's 25 x 25 rule

This seems to contradict former TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan's 25 X 25 vision, which he announced in 2020. As per the model, by 2025, only 25 percent of its associates will need to work out of facilities at any point of time.

Accenture’s mixed set of earnings numbers and its subdued guidance for the next year sent the American Depository Receipts of Infosys and Wipro tumbling by as much as 3 percent in overnight US trading. The results of the Dublin-based IT company, which has a large percentage of its workforce in India, may indicate how Indian rivals such as Infosys and Tata Consultancy Service are likely to shape up.

As analysts expected, the results don’t offer much cause for cheer for the Indian IT sector, and the gloom is expected to continue in Q2 as well — discretionary spending is yet to return, there is broad-based weakness in the communications, media and technology (CMT) vertical, and clients are signing fewer smaller deals as they prioritise larger programmes and focus on cost optimisation.

Accenture estimated revenue growth of 2 to 5 percent in FY24, and CEO Julie Sweet said the company is not assuming an improvement in the discretionary spending environment or the macro. According to a note by Kotak Institutional Equities, this is the “second-lowest among the beginning of year guidance in the past 16 years.”

Everest Group CEO Peter Bendor-Samuel told Moneycontrol there is a heavy component of weak market sentiment playing in Accenture's forward-looking commentary.

“Accenture is seeing clients being worried about global macro while considering spending decisions… Indian firms are experiencing the same market pressures of significantly diminished discretionary spend and reluctance to commit to new significant initiatives,” he said. “This will affect all of the IT Indian industry. Those firms with strong cost-cutting offerings such as TCS, HCL, Cognizant and Infosys will have aspects to their business which will partially offset these negative headwinds, but even these firms cannot fully escape the negative macro environment.”

Near-term concerns

Accenture’s bookings declined 10 percent and its revenue growth of 4 percent in its last quarter was driven by managed services, while consulting declined 2 percent year-on-year.

Analysts at Kotak said in their note that Accenture’s results and guidance reiterated “continued weakness in discretionary spending even as enterprises are willing to invest in core modernisation and cloud migration.”

Due to the weakness in the CMT vertical and the decline in consulting, it expects Tech Mahindra and Wipro to be impacted more.

“Caution on the macro is leading to clients looking for cost savings to fund transformation programmes. Cost take-out programmes are the dominant source of demand for Indian IT. The opportunity is not democratic and better addressed by select companies,” Kotak said.

Motilal Oswal said Accenture’s performance last quarter and the outlook for the next one add to concerns over the near-term demand environment.

“Additionally, 4Q deal booking declined 3% QoQ vs. company guidance of flat growth, implying lower visibility on demand in the current environment… In our view, ACN’s commentary implies near-term weakness for Indian IT companies,” it said in a note.

Jefferies said in a note that the sharp moderation in deal booking in consulting and managed services suggests rising scrutiny on IT spends. The limited growth in consulting bookings/revenue could be seen negatively for Wipro and a muted outlook for North America and the CMT vertical offers negative read-throughs for Tech Mahindra and LTIMindtree.

Pickup in 2HFY24?

While expectations initially were that Indian IT would pick up in the second half of the financial year, there is concern now that growth will be subdued. Jefferies said the tepid growth guidance and a sharp decline in the managed services bookings of Accenture in Q4 suggest that demand recovery is likely to be more gradual than expected.

JM Financial said Accenture’s guidance “pushes out hopes of a second-half recovery (Y/E March) for India IT Services players.”

“Besides, a modest implied growth rate through 2HFY24 for ACN risks India IT Services players’ FY25 revenue growth estimates as well. This, we believe, is an incremental negative… Continued weakness in North America’s BFSI and Hi-tech, though not surprising, indicates demand has not bottomed yet. ACN's commentary that weaker macro is taking its toll on the pace of spending of even the larger programmes could mean that large deal ramp-ups could take even longer, further impacting revenue growth,” it said.

In its note, Kotak said that a macro improvement is difficult to predict.

“We expect the current scenario to continue in 2HFY24 and some uptick in discretionary spending in FY2025 especially in BFSI and hi-tech verticals,” it said.

For Indian IT, while there have been many large-deal announcements in the past quarter, Everest’s Bendor-Samuel said there is significant indecision, creating delays and difficulties in getting them across the line.

“Contributing to this indecision is the prospect of recession next year. As the direction of the US and EU economies becomes clearer, we expect the pace of deal closing to accelerate. This increase in deal velocity is likely to occur regardless of the direction the economy takes,” he said.

Thanks to this, he said deal velocity is likely to increase in the fourth quarter and accelerate further next year.

“However, the nature of these large deals will shift, depending on the strength of the economy. With a recession, we expect to see an increase in large deals driven by portfolio consolidation and other cost-saving strategies. With an improving economy, we expect to see more large transformational and modernisation deals. The lower comparables this year will also make market acceleration easier in 24. Hence, we expect a somewhat better 24 followed by a stronger 25,” he added.",933,-0.6299446565764291

The report by TCS stated that digital and data-driven operations are top priority for a future-ready organisation. The report uncovered the top focus areas for large enterprises and essential enablers for futuristic business operations.

According to the study, respondents identified new business models, profitability and cashflow, and employee experience as the top three strategic focus areas for their organisations.

Key factor for 'pacesetters'

Companies are recognising the value of connected business operations to gain a competitive advantage, the report said, adding that 89 percent of respondents identify data-driven operations as the most important factor for their organisations to execute their top business priorities and drive profitability.

The other three top enablers for a future-ready organisation identified by the survey are harmonisation of technologies (88 percent), business outcome focus (86 percent), and integrated operations (83 percent).

The survey identified 'Pacesetters' as the organisations with higher-than-average growth and revenue performance in 2018-2022. Pacesetters showed more affinity towards many of the key enablers of future-ready operations compared to all other respondents, particularly leveraging ecosystem partnerships; simplifying and modernising their technology landscape; blending process, domain and technology; and harmonising multiple technologies.

""The survey affirms our belief that to stay competitive enterprises should first look at making their operations future-ready. Embracing the four key enablers - a digital and data-driven foundation, technology harmonization, business outcome focus, and integrated operations can allow companies to derive superior business outcomes, be more agile, innovative, and achieve competitive advantage,"" said Ashok Pai, Global Head, Enterprise Cognitive Business Operations, TCS.

AI strategy

As interest in artificial intelligence intensifies, the survey also polled respondents on what factors led to successful AI deployments. 89% cited quality data and governance, while 87% cited clear business charter. Interestingly, 81% said that removal of action bias - eliminating fear of missing out (FOMO)- is moderately or significantly important for successful AI technology deployments.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has expanded its long-standing partnership with Athora Netherlands (formerly VIVAT) to help the Dutch life insurance and pension provider with a better IT operating model to enhance customer experience, operational resilience and business agility, the Indian company said on August 31.

This will be a multi-year deal for the Indian IT services major, giving it an edge over its peers amid an uncertain demand environment. The company didn't disclose the size or the tenure of the deal.

“ …Our deep domain, application and insurance operations expertise combined with the next-gen hybrid cloud architecture powered by TCS Enterprise Cloud will enable them to deliver unmatched customer experience and build resilience,” Hemakiran Gupta, Head of Banking, Insurance and Financial Services, Europe, TCS, said.

TCS first started working with Athora Netherlands, which was then VIVAT, in 2015. With the latest extension, the IT player will contribute to Athora Netherlands’ “Ambition 2025” program to become a leading focused pensions and life insurance company.

As part of the contract, TCS will set up a hybrid cloud architecture for the company and automate and manage the firm's end-to-end business and IT operations across policy servicing, claims handling, and customer service for Athora’s closed book of life insurance policies under the Reaal brand.

TCS will also induct several Athora Netherlands employees from its life service business and set up a near-shore delivery centre in Alkmaar, close to the Dutch firm’s business centre in the Netherlands.

""The inducted employees will continue to perform the day-to-day management of the life service business in order to facilitate a smooth continuation of the services to Athora's customers,"" the company said.

TCS’ extensive insurance operations and IT expertise would help the company to secure business continuity as the portfolio gradually runs-off. It would help the company to improve customer service levels, while making the cost base more flexible, Bart Remie, Chief Technology & Operations Officer, Athora Netherlands, said.

LTIMindtree has given several of its employees zero percent increments for the fiscal year 2024 (FY24), amid a tough business environment. Some employees have also received hikes of 1-2 percent, according to employees at the company who spoke to Moneycontrol.

This comes at a time when the IT sector has been grappling with several macroeconomic challenges. Factors such as inflation, an impending recession, and events like the US banking crisis have led customers to become more cautious, resulting in a reduction of discretionary tech spending.

The company's wage hike cycle, which typically begins in April, was also delayed to August. This is a trend that has been seen with most IT services majors this year, including Infosys, HCLTech, and Tech Mahindra.

Sources told Moneycontrol that the significant reduction in increments was also due to LTIMindtree's recent changes to its internal pay structures. The variable pay component was converted into fixed pay in employees' annual packages. Variable pay could be around 8.5 percent of the overall package, one of the employees said.

Another employee cited above said that there were few projects, which meant that people were spending longer on the bench. As a result, they were unable to improve their ratings, which are used to assess their performance.

Employees who belonged to erstwhile Mindtree said that the policies in the new combined entity are mostly those of L&T Infotech, and they are different.

For instance, a source close to the company, seeking anonymity, explained that LTI used to follow an April-March wage hike cycle while Mindtree used to follow July-June. The merged entity decided to go with the June to July cycle from FY24 onwards, the source said.

Larsen and Toubro Infotech (LTI) and Mindtree started operating as a merged entity in November 2022.

Moneycontrol has learned that those who received 0 percent hikes or low single-digit hikes also took to complaining on public forums.

Responding to Moneycontrol’s queries, an LTIMindtree spokesperson explained, “At LTIMindtree, we've conducted performance appraisals for our employees at every level, aligned with industry norms. The percentage of salary increments for each employee is determined by their individual performance, length of service with the company, and market competitiveness.”

In Q1FY24, LTIMindtree missed street estimates and reported a net profit of Rs 1,152 crore, a 3.4 percent jump quarter-on-quarter. Its revenue for the quarter was at Rs 8,702 crore, up 0.1 percent in constant currency sequentially.

Onboarding delays

In April, LTIMindtree was in the eye of the storm for delaying onboarding of freshers it had given out offers to in 2022. Around 600-700 freshers awaited their joining dates.

Reacting to this later in May LTIMindtree CEO and MD Debashis Chatterjee had told Moneycontrol, ""People are probably not trying to understand the nitty-gritty but just make some noise. As people go through these programmes, we will have freshers joining in Q1, Q2, and Q3.”

Industry-wide delays in wage hike

Tech Mahindra, like LTIMindtree, has delayed wage hikes for a certain portion of its senior employees to the next quarter, after reporting a significant decline in profits and EBIT margins for the first quarter of FY24.

Wipro, which used to pay out its salary hikes in late Q2, has pushed the payouts to Q3. Infosys, which used to pay out salary hikes to employees below the management level in April and to the management level in July, has not yet made any announcement on the deferral or the quantum this year. During the company's earnings call for the last quarter, Infosys CFO Nilanjan Roy said that the matter is under consideration.

Meanwhile, HCLTech is completely doing away with wage hikes for senior management staff for FY24, who constitute a significant portion of the wage bill. As for junior employees, the IT major has deferred their hikes by a quarter.

The only exception to this situation was Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which gave about a 12-15% hike to ‘exceptional performers’ and kickstarted its promotion cycle on April 1.",673,-0.810917155309157

Attrition is down, subcontracting costs are being lowered and utilisation is improving but information technology (IT) firms’ employee costs are likely to remain elevated over FY24-25, which is likely to weigh on their margins, global brokerage firm Jefferies has said.

Indian IT services firms’ employee pyramids, the share of employees below 30 years of age, have deteriorated meaningfully in FY23 after a strong improvement in the previous year.

“Demand uncertainty in 2H FY23 already led to a slowdown in hiring and worsening pyramids as IT firms had slowed the back-filing of attrition particularly at junior levels. Within demand slowdown intensifying in FY24, IT pyramids will likely worsen further,” Jefferies analysts said in a report.

The percentage of employees below 30 for TCS, Tech Mahindra and LTIMindtree has fallen even below FY21 levels, more than offsetting the improvement seen in FY22.

For TCS, the share has fallen from 56 percent in FY21 to 53 percent in FY23. For Tech Mahindra, it declined from 50 percent in FY21 to 48 percent in FY23, and LTIMindtree slipped from 45 percent to 44 percent.

Even though overall attrition levels have declined, they remain high at the mid-level (30-50 years aged employees).

Follow our live blog for more updates

“This is evident from Infosys' 15 percent attrition in FY23 for mid-level employees which is 4-7x times that of the levels seen pre-Covid. This is also evident from mid-level attrition levels being higher/similar to junior-level attrition levels for TechM and LTIM,” it noted.

Usually attrition is significantly lower among mid-level employees compared to junior-level staffers.

Cost pressures

The higher attrition among mid-level employees resulted in higher remuneration linked pressures in FY23.

“TCS has seen an 11-14 percent YoY wage hike for mid-level employees compared to a 5 percent YoY increase in overall median remuneration in FY23. FY23 annual reports reveal similar trends for Infosys and TechM as well,” Jefferies said.

Top IT companies by employee cost

With mid-level attrition still significantly above normal and mid-level wages being 3-4x of junior-level wages, average wage cost is unlikely to subside meaningfully in FY24.

“We believe that employee/delivery costs are unlikely to support margins in FY24/25 even as IT firms look to shore up utilization…We thus expect aggregate employee related costs (employee + subcontracting) to remain at elevated levels of 67 percent of sales and continue to limit margin expansion for our coverage universe,” it added.

Jefferies has a “hold” rating for TCS, HCL Tech and Coforge. However, it has a “buy” recommendation for Infosys with a target price of Rs 1,550, which represents a potential upside of 9 percent from its current level of Rs 1,418.

Eight months after a lawsuit was slapped on IT major Tata Consultancy Services- (TCS) for discrimination and violation of visa norms, a court in New Jersey has trimmed the lawsuit by tossing one of the three claims made by the complainant. The other two claims will move forward.

In December 2022, the country’s largest software exporter was accused of having a systematic pattern of discriminating against non-South Asian and non-Indian applicants and employees, by a former employee. Shawn Katz, the complainant, alleged that the discrimination was with respect to hiring, staffing, benching, termination and promotion decisions, and that this policy is implemented top-down at the company.

Katz worked for the company for nine years before being let go after he was on the bench and could not find other projects.

“TCS’s discrimination is systemic and ongoing, and impacts non-South Asians and non-Indians across the company, as well as applicants, who are disfavored in TCS’s hiring, staffing, promotion, and termination/retention decisions,” the complaint read. His complaint said that the company was looking to maximise its benching, hiring and termination policies to maximise visa holders or those on an H-1B work visa in the US, which is sponsored by the employer. He also alleged that TCS prioritised visa holders for TCS positions.

Katz had filed a class action lawsuit, referring to a group of people who have suffered the same or similar injury.

Also read: TCS faces lawsuit in the US alleging discriminatory hiring practices, violation of visa norms

Katz alleged that he was facing disparate treatment on the basis of race, and unlawful employment practices on the basis of race and national origin. He sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages. In response, TCS file a motion to dismiss, which Katz opposed.

As per the order by Justice Brian R Martinotti in the New Jersey District Court this month, TCS had said that one of Katz’s disparate impact claims, as well as claims for injunctive relief, should be dismissed. “Additionally, TCS asserts all of Katz’s claims should be dismissed to the extent they are based on an alleged failure to hire or place,” as per the order.

Disparate impact requires that an employer cannot use a facially neutral policy — one where the policy does not discriminate on its face — but nevertheless causes a significant discriminatory hiring pattern.

The court did not move forward with Katz’s disparate impact claim under Title VII (equality before law) because he was unable to establish a ‘prima facie’ case for it.

However, the court said the allegations sound like disparate treatment, rather than disparate impact. Disparate impact refers to discrimination that is unintentional, and disparate treatment refers to intentional discrimination.

“TCS’s benching, hiring, and termination policies to maximise visa-holders, who Katz alleges are “almost exclusively South Asian,” followed by TCS prioritizing those visa-holders for TCS positions, are not facially neutral policies because Katz …alleges TCS implements these policies to further a preference for South Asians and Indians,” the order states.

Katz had also asked for injunctive relief. TCS in its motion said that Katz is not seeking reinstatement or being harmed by any action of TCS, but Katz, in an amended complement, sought reinstatement and sought injunctive relief on behalf of the class. The judge allowed this motion to move forward.

For the third charge, the IT major’s motion to dismiss all claims based on discriminatory hiring or placement was denied.

In response to queries, TCS said, “As the matter is sub judice, we will not be able to comment.”",607,-0.8628276983896891

(Image credit: Riti Kumari/Moneycontrol)

When Riti Kumari was 21, she received job offers from 13 companies including TCS, Infosys, and Wipro with one of the companies offering her a salary of Rs 17 lakh per annum. But, Kumari decided to follow her heart and instead took up an internship with Walmart. It's been a little over a year since and now Kumari earns more than Rs 20 lakh per annum.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, the software engineer from Bengaluru said that even though other offers were lucrative and her family was keen on her accepting one of them, Kumari was inspired by her sister to follow her instincts which is why she eventually chose Walmart. The internship period was of six months and she was promised a stipend of Rs 85,000.

""I was happy when I received Walmart internship offer, I was firm on joining it,"" she told the publication, adding that her parents were not very happy with her decision especially because not only was she opting for a role that would pay her much less than regular jobs, the internship would also get over in six months.

""It was a tough decision to choose between stability or risk,"" Kumari said. ""But at that time when no one was supporting my risk my sister advised me to follow my heart.""

Her sister, Preeti Kumari -- currently a Ph.D. student at IIT Dhanbad -- had rejected job offers to take Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) instead, against her family's wishes.

""That time also not everyone was in her favour but she took the decision and proved everyone wrong. So, I listened to my heart took the internship offer at Walmart, worked really hard, gave my pre-placement offer interviews, and ultimately got a job offer from Walmart,"" Kumari told Moneycontrol. According to reports published after she landed the job, Kumari was offered a salary of about Rs 20 lakh.

When asked about her parents' reaction to her career choices now, Kumari said, ""Right now they are extremely happy with my success. Being one of the highest-placed students in my school and college history makes them proud. My father used to teach in the same school where I studied so he feels extremely proud as all the teachers praise me and keep congratulating him.""

The panic surrounding banking contagion in the US affecting IT companies in the recent past may have subsided but a souring environment is adding to the latter’s woes.

On August 8, Moody’s lowered its ratings for 10 small and midsize lenders, and said it may downgrade six other major banks. This comes at a time when banks are continuing to focus on efficiency gains, and discretionary spending has been reduced significantly.

According to Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and CEO of global research firm Everest Group, this bad news for the US banks will only add to the headwinds that the IT sector has been facing amid significantly reduced discretionary spending in the sector. He added that Moody’s downgrade is indicative of the pressure that banks are under, smaller banks in particular.

But it may not be all bad news.

“We believe that this souring environment will only modestly reduce the level of discretionary spend,” he told Moneycontrol.

This is because spends are already below industry norms, and Everest believes it's either at or close to the bottom. Additionally, smaller US banks have been impacted more, which do not contribute to the Indian IT sector significantly.

“The small banks which this most affects or is indicative of, do not contribute significantly to the marketplace for the large Indian tech services firms. On the bright side we believe that this will add more impetus to the banking consolidation that the US Federal Reserve is attempting to drive, and as this plays out the larger banks will reach out to the Indian tech services firms for post-merger integration which will provide attractive opportunities in the sector,” Bendor-Samuel said.

IT companies’ BFSI challenge

The softness in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) vertical was a common theme across Indian IT companies in the recently concluded earnings season, despite some deal wins coming in from this vertical. While Wipro had said that BFSI was impacted due to softer discretionary spends, Infosys said clients were typically not choosing to spend at this time.

“Large and super regional banking clients in the US have been resilient during this quarter. Large banking clients are focusing on vendor consolidation, cost takeout and self-funding transformation programmes,” Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy told analysts. Infosys said it was seeing different patterns with different clients in the sector. Pressure was visible in asset management, investment banking, payments, and mortgages.

But IT companies have also maintained that the overall BFSI impact has been sporadic depending on the sub-segments like lending, insurance, capital markets, etc.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the country’s largest IT services firm, generates over 31 percent of its revenue from the BFSI vertical but has seen some moderation in growth in Q1FY24.

In a recent interview with Moneycontrol, K Krithivasan, CEO and MD of TCS, said, “When we say banking, financial services and insurance, large banks are a component of it. We have capital markets, we have insurance firms, we have mortgage firms – not every sector of the industry is doing well, right like we are doing quite well in banking. But all of them must fire for us to show you growth. If only one segment grows, you don't get that benefit.”

Large US banks reducing tech spends

According to a note from ICICI Securities, some of the largest US banks have started to reduce technology spending on a quarter-on-quarter basis, with the exception of Citi Bank. Banks are also increasingly highlighting efficiency targets from tech spends.

For instance, JP Morgan mentioned on its investor day that it has delivered $0.5 billion in productivity-led savings versus its 3-year productivity target of $1.5 billion set in May 2022, the note said.

In terms of tech spend reduction, major US banks including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley lowered spending in Q2CY23 versus Q1CY23, “yet grew at a rate in line with, or better than, their respective revenue growth”, ICICI Securities said.

While Bank of America and JP Morgan have retained their full-year tech spending outlook, across banks there will be a higher focus on realising efficiency gains through past and ongoing technology investments.

Commentary from banks has largely shown that there is a higher focus on realising efficiency gains through investments they have made previously as well as those that are ongoing.

However, according to ICICI Securities, mid-sized banks are continuing with their transformation programs, going by their commentary.

While it has slowed down on a QoQ basis, a note by Kotak Institutional Equities said that US regional banks have not yet announced any significant cuts to tech expenses or budgets, and some have even indicated a continuous pace of investment into technology. Key drivers, the note said, are the necessity to invest in tech to improve operations, keep pace with competitors and also for compliance. In addition, it's also laggards catching up.

“Fifth Third Bancorp, for example, indicated low double-digit growth in tech spends in CY2023. Keycorp is cutting costs in operations and investing in tech. First Horizon is ramping up tech spends to catch up after a period of underinvestment due to a merger plan with TD, which failed. Regions Financial indicated the possibility of tech spends as a percentage of revenue to go up from the current 9-11 percent,” the note read.

Analysts, however, do not expect an immediate revival in the BFS sector for Indian IT. Bendor-Samuel from Everest said that he believes things are either near or at the bottom of the current negative cycle.

“However, we don’t foresee significant improvement this year. Provided the economy does not turn bad next year, we expect growth to return next year and perhaps as early as the fourth quarter of this year,” he said.

ICICI Securities also said that a revival in BFSI is contingent on a revival in discretionary demand, something that is currently weak.

“Weak performance by Indian IT in the banking vertical is a paradox, partly explained by likely resilient spending on insourcing and cloud/SaaS consumption. Focus on expense reduction and tech modernisation at the same time can lead to large cost take-outs while discretionary spends can return post near-term headwinds,” the note read.

Insourcing in vogue

In some cases, even the resilient tech spending by the BFSI sector is not showing up in the IT companies’ revenues. This is largely because the banks are choosing to build out their own talent through captive centre investments and insourcing technology requirements from them.

According to Bendor-Samuel, as BFSI firms move into a mature digital run phase, there is a growing trend where they are looking to control the tech stack.

Kotak said in its note that in a weak environment, it is natural for companies to prioritise their own workforce and reduce consumption of third-party services.

“Demand for outsourced services can normalise once the demand environment brightens. The greater threat is a permanent shift towards insourcing, which banks such as DB have embarked on,” Kotak said.

But this isn’t expected to have a significant long-term impact on Indian IT.

“Although the GICs (global in-house centres) take work that otherwise could go to the tech services firms we do not see this trend as materially affecting the growth prospects for the Indian tech services firms. Simply put, the demand for services is too great and the need from tech services partners is accelerating as more and more of the economy is powered by digital IT,” Bendor-Samuel said.",1251,-0.564403555393219

Customers of top IT services firms are seeking pre-inflationary rates and pricing concessions for both new agreements and contract renewals, amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment and cuts in discretionary technology budgets.

Even as firms such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCLTech have denied that customers were seeking any significant pricing discounts in deal negotiations during their April-June quarter earnings conferences, industry observers said it is one of the key factors for the ongoing uncertainties in demand and delays in deal closures, making it a double whammy for the IT companies.

According to market intelligence firm UnearthInsight, there was a price increase of at least 20-30 percent on transformation deals during the pandemic, a hike that clients are seeking to pare to some extent, due to uncertainty about their growth prospects.

UnearthInsight estimates that discount asks have climbed to 50 percent of new deals but companies are agreeing in 30 percent of the instances, citing cost pressures.

Phil Fersht, founder and CEO of HFS Research told Moneycontrol, “Many renewals are being delayed with clients demanding pre-inflationary prices and some even discounts. Providers have to decide if they can afford to drop their prices to keep fully utilised or stand firm and grind out the current slump.”

At the same time, Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and CEO of Everest Group, a research and management consulting firm said that despite the increasing pushback from the customers, IT services firms aren't willing to budge.

“There is an increasing pushback against the post-pandemic price increases, this can cause protracted negotiations and along with the economic uncertainty contribute to the slowdown in pipeline closing and the increase of deal delays,” he said.

“At this time we have not seen a significant rollback of the price increases pushed through in the last two years but there is a growing push to claw back some of these increases and no appetite to allow further increases,” he added.

Impact on margins

While it is hard to determine if this has started impacting margins, a look at the first-quarter earnings across the top five Indian IT firms shows a decline in operating margins except for Wipro, whose margin expanded by 112 basis points (bps) quarter on quarter (QoQ). In terms of margins and the usual commentary, Q1 is seasonally a weak quarter for IT firms, as they roll out wage hikes during this period.

Additionally, this time companies saw weakness in several key sectors including BFSI, communications, media and entertainment (CME) and telecom. Tech Mahindra, which gets nearly 40 percent of its revenue from the CME vertical, saw its margins drop by 440 bps QoQ.

UnearthInsight's founder Gaurav Vasu said discounting demands are more pronounced in new deals and with newer clients compared to existing ones.

“In 2020, when the pandemic hit, the services companies already had to do discounting. So the same discounted price continued for some time, then suddenly when the war for talent happened, the services companies went back to the clients asking for some increase in pricing. Now that the inflation pressure too is coming down, this kind of price discounting is happening in three out of 10 deals, especially with new clients,"" Vasu told Moneycontrol.

But company managements denied seeing any significant ask for pricing discounts so far, analysts said.

“In terms of pricing reductions, there have been some sporadic requirements from different clients but largely the pricing environment remained stable,” C Vijayakumar, CEO and MD, HCLTech, said during the company's recent earnings conference with the media.

TCS CFO Samir Seksaria maintained that the overall pricing environment remained stable for the country’s largest IT services firm, instead, there was a “year-on-year increase in realisation,” wherein prices increased to some extent.

Overall, all the companies guided for slower revenue growth and delays in deal pipeline conversion in the upcoming quarters.

Delays in deal renewals

According to UnearthInsight’s estimates, in FY24, the top five Indian IT companies including TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra will cumulatively bag between $70 billion and $85 billion worth of order book/total contract value wins. Of this, renewals will account for around 30-35 percent of the total deals.

The ongoing delays in deal closures are happening across sectors and deal sizes with the exception of artificial intelligence, which continues to remain a bright spot given the Generative AI hype, analysts said. But they also expect revival to happen soon as Fed rate hikes and inflation starts to cool down over the next two quarters.

“Deals are pushed out by 45 to 60 days right now. This is due to two factors – a lot of folks decided to take summer vacation in North America which is a rare thing and the markets had not been sure of a recession in North America. Now, they know that the recession is more than unlikely to happen,” said Ray Wang, Principal Analyst and CEO, Constellation Research.

Vasu said $100 million-plus deals have slowed down, and he expects revival to come in largely from public sector and government deals across countries. Hi-Tech and SaaS should also bounce back from Q3 FY24. Manufacturing, BFSI and healthcare are taking comparatively longer to make decisions and even deals which are won have projects getting paused/taking longer to materialise. This trend will continue for the next 4 to 5 months in FY24.

“Long-term tech transformation deals which have a 3-to-5-year execution cycle and completely new-age technologies like Metaverse or experimental tech investment from clients are either on hold or taking 5 to 8 months to close,” Vasu said.

There are a number of complications this year with deal renewals, said Bendor-Samuel. One of them is vendor consolidation, which is underway with large accounts. Vendor consolidation deals in the initial stages are usually resource-demanding and do not really leave good margins; revenue starts rolling in only after certain maturity. Thus, they are complicated to execute, taking more time, and creating a lag in revenue recognition as workloads take time to transition.

Another factor is the increased focus on cost savings which results in more Request for Proposals (RFPs) but longer procurement cycles.

“For the first half of the year, there has been a lot of indecision as firms increasingly prepared themselves for a recession. This made decision-making more difficult and more drawn out resulting in a significant slowing in pipeline closing,” he explained.

Finally and potentially most importantly new deal signings are paired with a significant reduction in discretionary spending often pre-committed in existing contracts, Bendor-Samuel said, adding, “Hence, book-to-bill ratios which are strong stand in stark contrast to revenue recognition which has slowed significantly.”

The book-to-bill ratio for IT companies is a metric used to explain the value of orders received to the value of orders completed.

Tempering inflation

Analysts have started seeing green shoots in most major geographies like North America, expecting the recovery to kick in the next few quarters.

HFS Research has predicted that with the news on inflation running at only 3 percent in the US, a recovery for IT spends could be in Q4 2023.

However, US banks still seem to be weathering a crisis, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the Signature Bank earlier this year. Global credit rating firm Moody’s on August 7 downgraded ratings of 10 small to mid-sized US banks, adding that it may further downgrade some of the US’ biggest lenders, as the sector reported pressure in profitability in its recent company earnings. BFSI is one of the largest sectors to give business to IT services companies. TCS generates nearly 35-40 percent of its revenue from this sector.

Ashutosh Sharma, head of research at Forrester Research India, highlighted that the equity markets in North America and India have started to pick up.

“Equity markets have started to pick up in India and North America. Experts are seeing some green shoots appearing, expecting economies to recover and inflation to slow down. It might get delayed by a quarter or two, but there will be a recovery. For the time being, deals are getting pushed out and clients are not opening their purses easily,” he said.

Wang concurred, “Given the recent tech rallies and stock market growth, there is confidence that economic conditions are improving.”",1399,-0.37609240721011983

Paycheques of CEOs in India’s largest information technology (IT) companies have continued to remain high amid a challenging demand landscape for the sector, as it weathers macro headwinds in key markets such as North America.

Among the top six IT companies in India by revenue — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, and LTIMindtree—Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte draws the highest pay by far, all things considered. However, his income saw a 5 percent decline year-on-year in dollar terms.

Delaporte earned Rs 82.4 crore ($10 million) in FY22-23, a minor reduction from $10.5 million the year prior.

Of the Rs 82.4 crore, Rs 9.6 crore was his base salary, Rs 3.57 crore was by way of allowances, Rs 10.7 crore was variable pay, Rs 34.3 crore was retirals, and Rs 24.2 crore was ‘other annual compensation,’ per Wipro’s annual report. The compensation includes Delaporte’s restricted stock units (RSU).

The steepest fall in compensation among the six may be that of HCLTech CEO C Vijayakumar, who also took home the least among the top five.

He earned Rs 28.4 crore in FY22-FY23, down 79 percent from the preceding year. This includes Rs 16.44 crore as base salary, Rs 11.8 crore as performance-linked bonus, and Rs 24 lakh in benefits, perquisites, and allowances.

Vijayakumar's salary, however, may rebound the next year as HCLTech pays out the long-term incentive (LTI) at the end of two years. He will receive the LTI for FY21-22 and FY22-23 at the end of FY23-24.

How the others fared

CEO of Infosys, India’s second-largest IT company, Salil Parekh earned Rs 56.44 crore ($6.8 million) in FY22-23. Parekh earned Rs 6.67 crore in base pay, Rs 45 lakh in retiral benefits, Rs 18.73 crore in variable pay or bonus, and Rs 30.6 crore by exercising his RSUs. His pay fell 21 percent, primarily on account of exercising fewer RSUs.

At India’s largest IT company Tata Consultancy Services, former CEO Rajesh Gopinathan earned Rs 29.16 crore ($3.5 million) — of which Rs 1.73 crore was the salary, Rs 2.43 crore was by way of benefits, perquisites and allowances, and Rs 25 crore were commissions.

LTIMindtree CEO Debashis Chatterjee, who was appointed to the post in November 2022 post the merger of L&T and Mindtree, drew Rs 17.5 crore ($2.1 million) in salary in FY22-23, a decline of 0.36 percent. Of this, Rs 8.5 crore was the fixed component, Rs 8.8 crore was variable pay, and Rs 16 lakh was by way of perquisites.

Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani, who used to be among the highest paid CEOs in the industry, saw his pay halve in FY22-23 due to the fewer stock options exercised. Gurnani earned Rs 32 crore during this year. Of this, Rs 25 crore on account of ESOPs, Rs 2.7 crore as salary, and Rs 1.8 crore in commissions.

Median remuneration

There is also a yawning gap when it comes to CEO pay compared to the median remuneration at these companies.

Delaporte makes 916.12 times the median remuneration at his firm, Parekh 627 times, Gurnani 466.99 times, and Gopinathan 427.1 times. Vijayakumar makes 253.35 times the median remuneration at HCLTech, and Chatterjee 139.92 times.

IT CEO pay v/s median employee remuneration

Apart from median remuneration, the gap has also been widening when it comes to the pay of CEOs and freshers. In FY22, Moneycontrol reported that while the median annual pay of CEOs jumped 835 percent from Rs 3.37 crore in FY12 to Rs 31.5 crore in FY22, the median fresher package grew just 45 percent, from Rs 2.45 lakh to Rs 3.55 lakh, in the same time period.

The new guard in Indian IT

However, it’s been a year of change, with three new CEOs taking charge in 2023. Krithi Krithivasan took charge at TCS in June, and Mohit Joshi, Managing Director and CEO designate of Tech Mahindra, will take charge in December.

Krithivasan will be paid a basic salary of Rs 10 lakh per month, which can go up to a maximum of Rs 16 lakh per month, per the company’s annual report. However, his commission, which will make up a bigger chunk of his remuneration, is subject to company performance.

Joshi will receive an annual fixed compensation of Rs 6.5 crore (GBP 622,600), and an equal amount in annual variable pay. His variable pay in the first year is guaranteed. Additionally, he can get an annual overperformance bonus of up to 70 percent of his variable compensation.

He is also entitled to a joining bonus of $848,951 (Rs 6.96 crore). In addition, he will get one-time stock options worth $2.5 million (Rs 20.6 crore), 60 percent of which will vest once he finishes a year with the company, and the remaining when he finishes two years.

Further, he has stock options worth $3.5 million (Rs 28.8 crore) vesting in equal instalments over three consecutive years of employment, the first instalment vesting after the first year.

Cumulatively, Joshi stands to make a little over Rs 46 crore in his first year as CEO.

How this stacks up globally

Among the other leadership changes this year is the appointment of Ravi Kumar as Cognizant CEO in January. Cognizant was once the barometer of growth for the industry, and the gap in performance between Kumar’s former employer Infosys and Cognizant has been closing.

According to an exchange filing, Ravi Kumar will make an annual base salary of $1 million, annual cash incentive of $2 million, $4.6 million in RSUs vesting over a three-year period, and $6.9 million in performance-based stock units.

Apart from this, he received a sign-on bonus of $7,50,000, RSUs of a total of $5 million vesting in quarterly instalments from when he started, as well as performance units of up to $7.5 million measured over a four-year performance cycle.

In his first year, Kumar stands to make roughly $7 million (~Rs 57 crore) at the least from his annual base salary, RSUs as part of the new role, and his sign-on bonus.

The highest-paid executive is Accenture’s Julie Sweet, who took home $33 million in FY21-22, according to the company’s filings in December 2022 (Accenture’s fiscal year runs from September 1 to August 31). Of this, $25 million was in stock awards. With a cost of living adjustment for median remuneration, Sweet made 653 times the median income of an Accenture employee. Without the adjustment, it stands at 1,506.

IBM’s Arvind Krishna earned $16.58 million in 2022 — $1.5 million in base salary, $8.9 million in stock options, $8.93 million in RSUs and PSUs and $2.03 million in option awards. His annual incentives grew by more than $5,00,000 to $3.48 million. Krishna made 271 times the median remuneration at IBM.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on August 8 announced that it has been chosen as a strategic partner to transform the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) by bringing in more transparency and efficiency into the public procurement process.

This is the second government project the software exporter has bagged since winning the BSNL contract earlier this year. The second deal win makes TCS one of the preferred IT services firms for public scale work.

The company plans to redesign the platform for interoperability and cloud neutrality, making it technology-agnostic and vendor-independent. It will be built in an open-API-based architecture to make it highly scalable and sufficiently flexible to accommodate the anticipated six-fold growth in GMV over the next six years.

The design also aims to ease onboarding of new sellers, to get more diverse vendor base, especially SMEs /MSMEs, resulting in greater inclusivity and a more democratised access to the public sector market, the company said. The platform will have data analytics capabilities too to forecast demand and improve supply chain management along with better overall security.

The GeM platform in its current form, despite the architectural and scalability issues, is an end-to-end online marketplace for central and state government bodies, including public sector undertakings, for procurement of common use goods and services in a transparent and efficient manner.

TCS handles a Gross Merchandize Value (GMV) of over Rs 2 trillion purchased by 70,000-plus buyer groups from over 6.5 million sellers and service providers, including over 800,000 medium and small enterprises.

“In its next avatar, the GeM is envisioned to be an all-inclusive platform for government procurement, offering improved ease of doing business and transparency. With TCS as our SI partner, we are assured of architecting the new GeM with unmatched experience, rigor, and passion to develop a world class solution with resilient design, enriched user experience and innovative services,"" GeM chief executive PK Singh said.

""We also look forward to TCS’ expertise in managing mission mode programs. We have a strong aspiration to scale up GeM to transcend geographies,” he added.

“We are proud to partner with the Government of India for the GeM platform’s digital transformation, adding to our long list of contributions to Digital India,” Tej Paul Bhatla, Business Head, Public Services – India at TCS, said.

This project will be undertaken under TCS’ Public Services India business unit which provides services to the central and state governments, building innovative technology-led solutions that enhance transparency and efficiency, and contributing to the development of Digital India.

Government partnerships

In May 2023, TCS-led a consortium which bagged a $1.8-billion deal from the government-owned telco Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) to deploy 4G network across the country.

According to CEO and MD K Krithivasan, the company views such deals as an opportunity for 'nation building' and not for mere financial gains and profitability.

Unlike other IT services companies, TCS has had better track record of executing government projects.

Large Indian IT and software services exporters are not betting on fresh recruitments as it is likely to fall by approximately 40 percent on-year in the current financial year, highlighting the subdued demand and slump in technology services that is making tough for the $245-billion industry, a report has said.

IT services majors are likely to roll out offers between 50,000 and 100,000 employees during fiscal 2024, the Economic Times reported, citing data from Bengaluru-based staffing firm Xpheno. This will mark a steep drop from the net hiring of over 250,000 by these companies in the previous year.

Moneycontrol couldn't verify the report independently.

Top IT exporters — Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra — seem to be facing hiring challenges as they reported a cumulative decline of 21,838 in net headcount in the first quarter of FY24, the report said.

India's No.1 software services exporter TCS just added around 500 employees, and the remaining four reported a sharp fall.\

Further, global tech giants such as Accenture, Capgemini and Cognizant, which have a huge base of staff in India, reported a decline in headcount of more than 5,000 each during the most recent quarter.

“It looks like a washout year for IT services hiring. The dismal sentiment is expected to continue, with little or no indication of green shoots in the sector. This, coupled with a lack of visibility on rollout of new projects, is leading to companies withholding fresh mandates for hiring,” Sunil C, chief executive at TeamLease Digital, told the financial daily.

He went on to add that there will be a further 40 percent decline in net recruitment by the sector in the current fiscal because entities are concentrating on increasing employee utilisation metrics.

At present, the requirement for fresh hires is down by nearly 50 percent, as of August, compared to the previous year.

The government should consider lowering TCS on overseas tour packages and allow foreign cruise vessels to operate on Indian waters besides other steps to increase outbound tourism, a report said on Sunday.

The report titled ""Unlock the Potential: A Look into Outbound Tourism"", drafted by Nangia Andersen LLP in collaboration with FICCI said that India's outbound tourism market is projected to rise by 11.4 per cent CAGR between 2023 and 2032.

The growth in the Indian travel and tourism industry is driven by a combination of rising income levels and changing lifestyles, development of diverse tourism offerings and policy and regulatory support by the government authorities, it added.

The report suggested a few measures that the government may implement to support this expanding sector, including rolling back TCS (Tax Collected at Source), enhancing opportunities for partnership with foreign countries, collaboration with airlines, and allowing foreign cruise vessels to operate on Indian waters.

It said although the government has withdrawn the increase of TCS on overseas tour packages from 5 per cent to 20 per cent on amounts up to Rs 7 lakh per annum and for above Rs 7 lakh the tax increase has been deferred till October.

However, the long-standing demand of industry bodies for reducing the TCS percentage to 2.5 per cent remains unmet.

""It is believed that reducing the TCS will attract more people to book through Indian tour operators and enhance competitiveness,"" the report said.

Suraj Nangia, Managing Partner and Head – Government and Public Sector Advisory at Nangia Andersen LLP, said India's resurgent outbound tourism reflects the bold and adventurous spirit of today's travellers, driven by their expanding global aspirations.

""We envision a promising future for India's outbound travel, contributing significantly to the country's growth and cultural exchange on the global stage,"" Nangia said.

Poonam Kaura, Partner – Government and Public Sector Advisory at Nangia Andersen LLP, said, ""As India's outbound tourism market continues to thrive with an impressive year-on-year growth of 190 per cent, we are witnessing a remarkable surge in global exploration driven by rising incomes and a desire for diverse travel experiences.""",364,0.9354600012302399

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest software company, has rolled out a new operating structure, the first significant move by CEO K Krithivasan after he took charge on June 1.

TCS also rejigged its senior leadership, adding several new senior executives, global heads and veterans who have spent over 18-30 years with the company.

On July 29, the company said that based on the discussions with customers and associates over the last couple of months, TCS will be able to deliver the best value to the customers by synergising its domain and contextual knowledge across units.

""In this context, we have announced the new operating structure, which regroups our existing Industry Solutions Unit (ISUs) along industry segments into key business groups. The above changes will help in deepening customer centricity, which is pivotal to our growth,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement.

The move appears to be a grudging reversal of the reorg that TCS unveiled earlier; while clients will still be grouped into four buckets based on their account size, they will ultimately be housed within industry verticals.

According to an internal memo sent by Krithivasan that Moneycontrol has accessed, the new operating structure will have the following business groups- BSFI Americas led by Susheel Vasudevan; BFSI UK, Europe and Australia led by Shankar NS; Communication, Media and Information Services led by Akhilesh Tiwari; Life Sciences, Healthcare, Energy, Resources and Utilities led by Debashis Ghosh; Manufacturing led by Anupam Singhal, Retail, CPG, Travel, Transportation and Hospitality led by Krishnan Ramanujam; and Technology, Software and Services under V Rajanna.

All the ISU Heads will report to the respective business group heads with no other change in the ISU structure. All the RIG (relationship incubation group) accounts will also be moved under the appropriate ISUs.

TCS has also created an Enterprise CBO (cognitive business practices) unit focussed on enterprise functions such as F & A (Finance & Accounting), HR procurement etc. This unit will also own TCS Cognix platform and will be led by Ashok Pai.

Further, another unit called TCS AI Cloud has been created combining all its public cloud units and Al initiatives. This unit will be led by Siva Ganesan with Krishna Mohan as the Deputy Head. In terms of functions, while Harrick Vin takes charge as CTO, Abhinav Kumar will take charge as CMO.

All of these roles are effective August 1 and will report directly to Krithivasan, who believes that the above changes will help in deepening customer centricity, crucial to the company’s growth amid a uncertain demand environment.

The previous restructuring plan was unveiled in April 2022 by former CEO and MD Rajesh Gopinathan. As per the structure, the company divided clients into four distinctive business groups depending on a client’s journey with it instead of verticals and geographies. This had become a major bone of contention for senior leaders and vertical heads.

These structures were the acquisition group, relationship incubation group, enterprise group and finally business transformation group. Each of these groups had a different head too.

People familiar with the development said that the concept of grouping clients based on the relationship maturity is being retained in the new plan, but under the umbrella of the verticalised business group. Beyond that, it's a reshuffle of responsibilities at the senior-most level. The Industry Solutions Unit (ISU) structure and customer-facing layer have not been touched.

As Moneycontrol had earlier reported, the previous group-wise restructuring had left many TCS' senior executives loath to take ownership of an account because of the likelihood of it going out of their hands once it becomes big. This caused unrest among senior executives, especially vertical heads who had no power over their P&L (profit and loss).

Krithivasan himself had kept his banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) vertical out of the previous structure. BFSI accounts for nearly 35-40 percent of the company's overall revenue.

Analysts Moneycontrol spoke to welcomed the move, since this is closer to TCS' previous operating structure and empowers industry heads who were unhappy with the reorg.

New appointments

TCS also made several leadership appointments and changes. The company's chief marketing officer, Rajashree R, will be stepping down from her senior management personnel (SMP) position on July 31. According to her LinkedIn profile, she has transitioned to become a Vice-President.

Sources told Moneycontrol that Abhinav Kumar, a TCS veteran who has been with the company for over 21 years, will be taking over the role as the new chief marketing and communications officer for its global markets. Prior to this, he was in the same role but focussed only on the Europe market.

Company's chief technology officer (CTO) K Ananth Krishnan is retiring on July 31.

Apart from this, Harrick Vin, Shankar Narayanan, V Rajanna, Siva Ganesan, Ashok Pai and Reguraman (Regu) Ayyaswamy will be appointed as SMPs effective from August 1. All of them have been with TCS for over 18-32 years.

Vin takes over as the CTO post Ananth Krishnan's retirement from August 1.

Challenging business environment

All of these changes come at a time when the company is already weathering multiple challenges including macroeconomic uncertainties and dealing with a recruitment bribe case.

In a post earnings interview with Moneycontrol a few weeks back, Krithivasan said that achieving double-digit growth this year could be challenging as clients remain cautious in an uncertain demand environment.

Last month, TCS had sacked six employees and banned six major staffing firms after the employees were found to be taking bribes by giving preferential treatment to certain staffing for recruiting subcontracted employees. The company is also investigating its entire supply management following this incident.

TCS was again in the eye of storm when it was found to be deferring onboarding of over 200 lateral hires by more than three months.

On the deal win front, despite a challenging environment, TCS bagged back-to-back mega deals of over $700 million plus in the United Kingdom, including both through renewals and new clients.",1003,-0.05549102479761297

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's largest software company, announced senior leadership changes effective from August 1, 2023. These changes follow the recent appointment of TCS' former global head for banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), K Krithivasan as the company's CEO and MD.

According to a BSE filing, Rajashree R, Chief Marketing Officer will be stepping down from her senior management personnel (SMP) position on July 31. According to her LinkedIn profile, she has transitioned to become a Vice-President. As per sources in the know, Abhinav Kumar, a TCS veteran who has been with the company for over 21 years, will be taking over the role as the new chief marketing and communications officer for its global markets. Prior to this, he was in the same role but focussed only on the Europe market.

K Ananth Krishnan, the company's Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice-President is set to retire on July 31.

Harrick Vin, Shankar Narayanan, V Rajanna, Siva Ganesan, Ashok Pai and Reguraman (Regu) Ayyaswamy will be appointed as SMPs effective from August 1. All of them have been with TCS for over 18-32 years.

A TCS spokesperson said, ""Based on the discussions with customers and associates over the last couple of months, we believe, TCS can deliver the best value to the customers by synergising it’s domain and contextual knowledge across units.""

""In this context, we have announced the new operating structure, which regroups our existing Industry Solutions Unit (ISUs) along industry segments into key Business groups. The above changes will help in deepening customer centricity, which is pivotal to our growth,"" the spokesperson added.

Vin is Chief Services Innovation Officer at TCS. He has been in academia and industry for over 30 years and has been with TCS for 18 years. He headed the TCS Digitate division.

Narayanan is a Senior Vice-President and has been with the company for over three decades. He has held various important roles, including the Global Head of the Retail, CPG, Travel & Hospitality businesses at TCS and Business Excellence & Transformation of large accounts. Previously, he has also been the head of TCS's UK and Ireland markets.

Rajanna too is an SVP with 29 years at TCS. He headed the TCS's communications, media and technology businesses. Ganesan, SVP and global head Ganesan of the Microsoft Business Unit comes with 32 years of experience with TCS alone. He brings in across-the-board experience in sales, solutioning, operations, program management, delivery and global account management.

Pai is an SVP and the global head of TCS’ Cognitive Business Operations (CBO), and played a pivotal role in helping enterprises transform

for the digital economy. Ayyaswamy, who comes with 38 years of experience in the IT industry with 29 years in TCS alone, is an SVP and the global head of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Digital Engineering Units.

These senior leadership appointments are happening as Krithivasan and the company is set to navigate a challenging macro environment and increasing uncertainty around deal conversion timelines. During a recent interview with Moneycontrol, Krithivasan said that double-digit growth in FY24 could be challenging.

Meanwhile, TCS was also in the eye of the storm after some of its senior employees were found to be accepting bribes against giving business and preferential treatment to certain staffing firms involved in recruiting subcontracting staff.

TCS ended up firing six employees and banning six staffing firms. Three more employees are under investigation for this, while TCS is also looking at its entire supply management and rejigging some of its senior staff in the Resource Management Group (RMG) division.

TCS, on July 12, reported a 16.8 percent increase in net profit on a year-on-year (YoY) basis in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, driven by strong growth in total contract value (TCV) deal wins despite a tough business environment.

Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at Rs 59,381 crore, marking an on-year surge of 13 percent. In constant currency terms, the revenue grew by 7 percent YoY.",674,0.3333367506663005

Indian IT majors kicked off a sombre earnings season, where their comments highlighted an uncertain demand environment, cuts in discretionary spending, project delays and a decline in people addition.

The IT industry is bearing the brunt of global macroeconomic challenges, as customers are coming out of a banking crisis, grappling with an impending recession in the US and a slowing economy in Europe.

The top five Indian IT companies (by market capitalisation) have seen their sequential revenue growth on a constant currency basis at anywhere between -2.8 percent and 1 percent, a far cry from the high single-digit and double-digit growth seen last year. The biggest shocker, however, was Infosys’ sharp guidance cut for the year from 4-7 percent to 1-3.5 percent.

The green shoots this quarter may have been companies talking about possibilities around generative AI with regard to client demands and efficiency within the organisation, but it may have to do more with bluster than substance at the moment.

Revenue guidance updates

Revenue growth for the quarter was hit after a period of frenzied activity last year. Wipro reported the biggest fall at -2.8 percent in constant currency terms, HCLTech at -1.3 percent, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) at 0 percent and LTIMindtree at 0.1 percent, with Infosys leading the pack at 1 percent.

In a note, Kotak Institutional Equities said that the slowdown is industrywide, and that TCV or total contract value wins are not translating into revenues “due to tardy pace of decision making, discretionary spending cuts and delay in ramp-ups. Infosys has taken the upfront hit in its guidance.”

It also expects revenue growth downgrades from other IT majors.

“HCLT has maintained revenue growth guidance of 6-8%, which in our view is difficult to achieve, noting high hurdle rate for growth in the next three quarters. TCS does not guide but had indicated caution. Wipro has guided for a weak quarter. We do expect revenue growth downgrades for other Tier 1 IT,” it read.

HCLTech’s CEO and MD C Vijayakumar told Moneycontrol that his confidence in maintaining the company’s revenue guidance stems from a “very strong pipeline” which is at an “all-time high” in the ongoing quarter. Meanwhile, LTIMindtree’s CEO and MD Debashis Chatterjee said that given the uncertainty and delays in deal closures despite a strong demand, the company’s aspiration to achieve double-digit growth in FY24 will be challenging.

TCS’ quarterly growth this quarter was the slowest in a decade excluding the Covid period, and CEO K Krithivasan told Moneycontrol that achieving double-digit growth in the current business environment won’t be an easy task.

Operating margins

TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCLTech reported a decline in quarterly operating margins, while LTIMindtree reported an increase of 30 basis points (bps). LTIMindtree expects further expansion in margins, to reach the 17-18 percent range.

Infosys’ margins decreased 20 bps sequentially and came in at 20.8 percent. “70 bps benefit from cost optimisation including increase in utilisation and automation efforts was offset by 90 bps QoQ (quarter-on-quarter) headwinds from higher variable pays and promotions. Company retained its EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin guidance of 20-22% for FY24,” analysts at ICICI Securities said in a note.

Wipro’s margins dropped from 16.3 percent in the previous quarter to 16 percent in Q1, and the management expects it to remain in the same range in the near future, according to an HDFC Securities note. Analysts at Axis Direct said rising subcontracting costs and cross-currency headwinds may impact the company’s operating margins negatively.

TCS and HCLTech became the biggest losers in terms of operating margins. TCS’ margins were down 130 bps to 23.2 percent in Q1, mainly due to wage hikes and promotion cycles kicking off in April. HCLTech’s margins fell to 17 percent, down by 120 bps on-quarter.

Deal pipeline

With the exception of HCLTech, all the companies mentioned here have reported strong deal wins this quarter. While customers re-evaluate discretionary spending, cost takeout, efficiency deals, digital transformation deals and excitement around exploring generative AI continue to drive demand.

Several large deals and deal renewals were reported in Q1 across companies. For cost take-out deals, however, margins are lower, especially in the initial transition phases. Like LTIMindtree’s Chatterjee points out, the revenue acceleration starts only after the transition is completed. “Because of the delayed decision-making, the transitions are also getting delayed. And that's why the revenue realisation is also getting delayed,” he said.

LTIMindtree’s order book for Q1 stood at $1.41 billion, up from $1.35 billion last quarter.

In the second quarter of the calendar year 2023, too, customer sentiment shifted decisively to a more-for-less orientation with discretionary spend taking a significant step backwards and firms looking to adopt strategies to save money, said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and CEO of global research firm Everest Group.

He added, “The increase in cost saving-oriented transactions was not sufficient to offset the reduction on discretionary spend with existing transformation projects being cancelled, trimmed back, and new ones postponed or eliminated.”

TCS at $10.2 billion has actually crossed its quarterly guidance band of $7-9 billion TCV, for the second consecutive quarter. The company reported at least five to six mega deals of $700 million-plus in the UK in 2023, apart from a $1.8-billion deal from the government-owned telco Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) won through a consortium.

Wipro reported large deals to the tune of $1.2 billion. According to CEO and MD Thiery Delaporte, this was a 9 percent year-on-year growth and the highest bookings for the company in eight quarters.

Infosys’ shocking revenue growth guidance cut came despite the company reporting healthy large deal wins for the quarter coming in at $2.3 billion, which was up both on a quarterly and annualised basis.

HCLTech’s quarterly order book for Q1 dropped to $1.56 billion, following seven consecutive quarters of holding at $2 billion-plus in deal wins.

Dip in hiring and attrition

After frenetic hiring, it's now the time for the numbers to trend downward. Of the companies that have reported their numbers thus far—TCS, Wipro, HCLTech, Infosys and LTIMindtree—TCS is the only one to add employees on a net basis, 523 on its employee base of 6.15 lakh.

The other four have seen their headcount reduce cumulatively by over 20,000. Wipro makes up the biggest chunk of this pie, with its headcount on a net basis reducing by 8,812. This is concerning as hiring has for long been a lead indicator of demand in the people-dependent sector.

Attrition, while having dropped, continues to be at a band higher than companies are comfortable with. Most companies have seen attrition reduce to the 17-18 percent range on a trailing 12-month basis.

Over the headcount decline, companies say that they hired ahead of time in previous years, and are currently looking to make their fresh hires productive, utilise the bench strength and upskill existing talent than go out to the market to recruit.

Staffing industry experts had expected negative headcount movement this quarter, and given the lack of visibility on the road ahead in the commentary of IT companies, they do not expect things to get much better in the next two quarters.

Ray Wang, CEO and principal analyst at Constellation Research, told Moneycontrol that attrition not being backfilled has led to headcount being adjusted, but the same is a short-term fix. “Readjustment of skills was needed but we won’t know that until we see the hiring and retention of younger workers with newer skills. That second part is critical in the mid to long term,” he said.

Everest’s Bendor-Samuel said every tech and tech services company over-hired last year, and now that demand has moderated significantly and attrition is down, tech services have large benches. This, he said, is an excellent time for companies to improve quality of talent in organisations and move out lower-performing talent.

“This also comes at a time when the skills that are needed to serve the new digital marketplace are significantly different and hence these firms are also taking the opportunity to rebalance their skills inventory. All that said, we expect growth to continue but at a significantly reduced rate and likely accelerate next year unless we enter a significant recession,” he added.

Promises in generative AI

Amid caution in demand and tepid numbers, generative AI was probably the most used and bankable term during the IT earnings season in Q1. From TCS and Infosys to HCLTech and LTIMindtree, all the companies shared major updates.

Everest Group’s Bendor-Samuel said, “The AI wave which is building is expected to accelerate tech services growth next year and we will likely see growth ranging between 5 and 9 percent provided we do not enter a significant recession. It is too early in the AI wave maturity to expect this to affect revenues in the next two quarters to a significant degree.”

TCS, the country’s largest IT services firm, is working on 50 proof of concepts (PoCs) and has over 100 generative AI deals in its pipeline. It plans to train a talent pool of over 100,000 associates in generative AI. Infosys announced that it has 80 active generative AI projects in the pipeline and has trained 40,000 associates in AI/machine learning skills so far. Some of its recently signed mega-deals and extensions involved deploying generative AI capabilities.

HCLTech has over 140 external and internal generative AI projects at various stages of maturity, from PoCs to implementation. Vijayakumar also told Moneycontrol, that the company will be training around 20,000 associates in generative AI skills over the next 18 months and has set up three global labs.

Wipro is investing $1 billion over the next three years to strengthen its AI capabilities, and is training all its employees.

Despite all the hype and announcements, industry analysts and experts believe that it is still too early for IT companies to start seeing actual significant revenue conversion from generative AI, as most of the projects are still in PoC stages.

The way forward

According to Bendor-Samuel, the sector is growing but at a significantly reduced rate. He estimated that industry growth has fallen from a high of 13 percent last year to 4 percent this year.

“As we look forward to the rest of the year, we are observing a slight uptick in customer sentiment. At this time it does not appear that this uptick is sufficient to reverse the sentiment away from more for less. However, it does appear that there is a little more available. Hence, we believe that the industry has likely achieved a new normal with growth ranging from 4-6 percent for the rest of the year,” he said.

Bendor-Samuel also highlighted that the new normal of slowing growth in the industry will cause most firms to downgrade guidance like Infosys. Though some firms are better positioned and will have a less dramatic reset, in the case of Infosys they are also dealing with the lumpiness of the mega deal cycle and have also had to do some adjustments for mega deals already signed.

CFOs are in general being cautious as they should be, but they seem to be slightly optimistic for a better fiscal year Q2 and Q3 in general, said Wang.

He said, “As mentioned, the scenario will get better in Q2 (of FY24) as we are close to the end of calendar year contracts. The summer has been slow in general for all the majors. However, there were interesting pockets of growth from companies like Persistent Systems.”",1958,-0.12083417177200317

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on July 19 announced that US-based medtech giant GE HealthCare Technologies has expanded its long-standing partnership with the IT services major to drive the digital transformation of its global IT function.

This deal renewal will be a shot in the arm for TCS in North America, which is currently witnessing uncertainties due to macroeconomic headwinds. While the company did not disclose any financials of the deal, according to sources, this is going to be a large deal for TCS coming in the range of $100 million -500 million.

Under this collaboration, TCS will take charge of the development, maintenance, rationalization, and standardization of GE HealthCare's enterprise IT applications. In a press statement, TCS added that the objective is to leverage advanced software engineering practices, artificial intelligence, and digital technologies to achieve faster value realization, operational resilience, and enhanced productivity.

Further, by collaborating with TCS, GE HealthCare aims to address evolving patient needs, support medical technology research, and invest in distinct care solutions.

As per the statement, the expanded partnership will help deliver intelligent care solutions to over one billion patients across more than 160 countries.

Anupam Singhal, Business Head, Corporate Accounts, TCS, said, ""The goal is to help GE HealthCare develop innovative healthcare products and services that enhance patient outcomes while modernizing and supporting their existing application estate.""

In 2023, TCS reported some of its very large deals of $700 million plus in the United Kingdom region. So far, it has bagged a $723-million deal from insurer Phoenix Group, the Marks & Spencer deal, a 10-year contract with the Teacher’s Pension Scheme in England and Wales and a $1.1 billion deal from UK's National Employment Savings Trust. TCS also won another deal from Phoenix Group's subsidiary last month.",315,0.5608965754508972

Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque predicts that most of the outsourced programmers in India will lose their jobs in the next year or two as a result of artificial intelligence (AI) playing a larger role in software development and reducing significantly the need for human involvement.

“I think that it affects different types of jobs in different ways,” Mostaque was quoted as saying on a call with UBS analysts at the Swiss investment bank last week, CNBC reported on July 18.

According to Mostaque, as reported by the business news website, the influence of this AI trend will vary, and not everyone will experience the same level of impact.

The website quoted Mostaque as saying on India, “Outsourced coders up to level three programmers will be gone in the next year or two...""

Quoting Mostaque, who was speaking about coders in a general context, the report said, ""Why would you have to write code where the computer can write code better? When you deconstruct the programming thing from bug testing to unit testing to ideation, an AI can do that, just better.”

“But it won’t be doing it automatically, it will be AI ‘co-pilots,’” Mostaque said. “That means less people are needed for classical programming, but then are they needed for other things? This is the question and this is the balance that we have to understand, because different areas are also affected differently.”

According to a Bloomberg report, India is home to more than 5 million software programmers.

In India, IT services and consulting firms such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, HCL Tech, and Tech Mahindra are among the largest outsourcing providers.

But, India's top IT firms say they are 'adapting to AI capabilities'

IT companies in India are already partnering with Google, Microsoft, and Microsoft-backed OpenAI (which developed ChatGPT), as the battle to gain market share for deploying generative AI solutions globally intensifies.

TCS says shifting gears to be more AI-centric

Last month, TCS Chairman N Chandrasekaran in his letter to shareholders said global transitions in the areas of energy, supply chains and artificial intelligence will require significant investments in technology and innovation, and that the impact of AI and machine learning “will be very profound”.

Earlier this month, it announced its plan to get 25,000 employees trained in Microsoft's Azure Open AI to help clients accelerate their adoption of this new technology.

Wipro has already established the Generative AI Centre of Excellence (CoE) to work with technology partners and academic institutions driving research in advanced areas of AI. Mukund Kalmanker, VP & Global Head, AI Solutions, Wipro, told Moneycontrol in May that the company has a robust enterprise-wide AI talent management plan in place, which includes both hiring talent as well as a well-developed AI curriculum to train employees at the Wipro AI Academy.

Two of India’s top five Information Technology companies saw their headcount shrink by over 11,000 people during the quarter ended June, a definitive indicator of the struggle IT companies in the country face after the rapid growth of the Covid pandemic years.

While Tata Consultancy Services with its 6.15 lakh-strong workforce added just 523 employees on a net basis, its peers Wipro and HCLTech both saw huge declines in headcount on a sequential basis. Wipro ended the quarter with 8,812 fewer employees from last quarter, while HCLTech saw its headcount fall by 2,506.

Cumulatively, the net addition by the three IT giants, which have all reported their results, stands at -10,795, a far cry from the 31,671 people the three companies added on a net basis in the same quarter last year.

Tata Consultancy Services

TCS was the only one to see a positive net addition among the companies under consideration. However, it has delayed onboarding scores of lateral recruits having wide experience levels, with Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad stating this was due to project budgets.

“While we are committed to honouring all the job offers we have made, our focus currently is on leveraging the capacity we had built earlier,” Lakkad told analysts.

The muted net addition also reflects limited demand visibility, implying there is continued uncertainty on the timing of deal ramp-ups, analysts said.

Chief Executive Officer K Krithivasan did emphasise the near-term uncertainty, and said clients are taking a re-look at programmes and pausing them wherever they think the ROI is not strong.

The company’s attrition has continued to trend downwards, coming in at 17.8 percent — a figure the company expects to drop further.

HCL Technologies

HCLTech, which saw a weaker-than-expected quarter, saw its headcount dip for the first quarter since Q1FY21, ending with 2,506 fewer employees than at the end of the previous quarter. The company’s management attributed this to not backfilling all attrition, and prior fresher additions.

“If you look at the number of freshers we’ve added in the last couple of years, the last two years we’ve been making those investments to add freshers. They go through a cycle of training before they get productive, so that’s also flowing through into our productive capacity. That’s one of the reasons we didn’t go for replacement hires this quarter,” said Chief People Officer Ramachandran Sundararajan.

HCLTech’s attrition has trended downward to 16.3 percent, to pre-pandemic numbers.

Wipro

Wipro, which has seen a sequential decline for three quarters, has maintained that while some headcount reduction can be attributed to automation related to AI, it is primarily due to the wide bench. In an interview with Moneycontrol, Chief Human Resources Officer Saurabh Govil said that given there are enough people in the organisation, Wipro can use the bench and deploy those it hired last year — and utilisation can be better as well.

Wipro’s onboarding delays for those it hired in 2022 continue, with the company not onboarding any freshers in Q1.

Low demand persists

The hiring delays are in line with a precipitous drop in hiring in April and May, with some moderate uptick in June.

According to Xpheno’s active jobs report, the IT sector’s current active open jobs level is the second lowest talent demand level since March 2020. As per the report, active hiring is in a tailspin, as seen during the last three quarters, with minor signs of a sequential recovery last month. On a year-on-year basis, the IT sector’s active demand was 61 percent lower this June as compared to June 2022.

For a sector that is a significant employer, the contribution to overall job openings has been declining as well. As per the Xpheno report, that contribution is at a record low of 34 percent.

A note by ICICI Securities said that based on the commentary and results of Accenture, TCS, HCL, and Wipro, “it is evident that the companies aren’t seeing any immediate demand revival in Q2FY24 and that visibility of recovery in H2FY24 too is limited at this stage.”

This, the note said, could largely be due to multiple low-RoI discretionary projects over the past two years now getting cancelled or seeing rampdowns amid adverse macro conditions. “Lack of visibility around the revival of these projects is dissuading company managements from guiding for strong recovery in H2FY24 in our view, despite decent orderbooking momentum,” it added.",748,-0.7467087739043765

The Nifty IT index hit a 52-week high on July 17, with most constituents trading at multi-month highs despite lacklustre earnings from the IT majors for the first quarter of this fiscal.

The index was trading 0.29 percent up at 31,036.75 at 1.50 pm, after touching its 52-week high of 31,658.10 earlier in the session.

Since touching its 52-week low of 26,184 on April 17, the index has climbed nearly 5,500 points.

Wipro was the top gainer in the index, jumping around 3 percent, despite the IT major last week posting a lower-than-expected bottomline for the April-June period.

The IT services company reported a net profit of Rs 2,870 crore in the first quarter after market hours on July 13. Though the bottomline was up around 12 percent on year, it fell 6.6 percent on a sequential basis, largely due to a decline across all major financial metrics. Moreover, the net profit for the quarter under review also lagged the Street's estimate of Rs 2,976 crore.

On a year-to-date basis, the Nifty IT index is now trading with gains of over 10 percent, led by midcap IT names like Persistent Systems and Coforge, which have surged by nearly 30 percent each, while shares of Tech Mahindra, and LTIMindtree have gained over 20 percent each. Infosys is the only stock on the index now which is trading with losses on a year-to-date basis, although even that stock has recovered most of its losses.

Siddharth Bhamre, Research Head, Religare Broking, said he is bullish on the information technology (IT) sector, which is not finding too many takers right now because of the cautious view on the United States economy. And the latest quarterly numbers seem to bear that out. HCL Tech’s and Wipro’s June quarter earnings were short of market expectations and while TCS numbers just about met analyst estimates, there were signs of growth slowing down.

“The talk of the US slipping into recession has been on for more than a year now, and a large part of that fear is already reflecting in the prices.

HCLTech is skipping compensation review entirely for salary hikes of senior management level employees for the fiscal year 2024, which forms a significant part of the company’s wage bill. This development comes as the country’s third largest IT services firm is facing a tough business environment and reported weak June quarter performance this week.

Speaking to analysts during the company’s earnings conference, CEO and MD, C Vijayakumar said, “This year, we have made a decision to skip the compensation review, starting with the management layer, which is E4+, and also defer for junior to mid-level people by a quarter, which is E3 and below levels.""

According to CFO Prateek Aggarwal, the E4+ layer which includes the senior most staff, also forms a significant portion of the company’s wage bill.

Regarding junior to mid-level staff, Chief People Officer Ramachandran Sundararajan said, “Typically, this time of the year, we make our announcements on pay reviews. Last couple of years the hiring that we have done and the compensation reviews that we have done, we have taken that into consideration and have taken a decision to defer our annual reviews by a quarter.”

HCLTech reported big misses on several counts in Q1FY24, against analyst estimates. One of the key metric missed was the EBIT margin which fell to 16.9 percent in Q1, down from 18.2 percent in the previous quarter. Aggarwal added that nearly 36 bps of fall in the margins were driven by lower utilisation rates in Q1.

The company also reported a decline of 2,506 employees in its total headcount in Q1, while choosing not to back fill attrition.

Improving utilisation rates will be a key component to ensure improvement in operating margins which will eventually help the company achieve its guidance of exiting FY24 with an 18-19 percent margin, Vijayakumar told Moneycontrol during an interview.

Not just HCLTech, peers Infosys and Wipro too are delaying pay hikes. As of now Wipro is holding up its wage hike cycle until the third quarter or the December quarter, unlike last fiscal when hikes were rolled out in the September quarter.

Wipro will also be paying out only 80 percent of the variable pay to its junior level employees in Q1, which is linked to the company’s overall performance.

Infosys too has deferred pay hikes, which is generally rolled out to employee levels below the senior management in April and to the senior management in July. Employees of both of these segments didn't received any communication from the company on these delays.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) turned out be an outlier this time as it has already kick started its promotion cycle, having offered 12-15 percent hikes to its exceptional performers effective from April 1. TCS, however, has deferred onboarding of over 200 lateral hires with two to 15 years of experience until October citing uncertainty and delays in project commencement.",480,-0.6247015297412872

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCS

TCS reported in-line revenue of USD7.2b in 1QFY24, flat QoQ in constant currency (CC) and a tad below our estimate of 0.3% CC. Revenue growth was affected by broad-based demand weakness across key verticals (BFSI) and geographies (US). The management indicated that a demand slowdown due to macro concerns is leading to reprioritization of deals, which is resulting in pauses and deferrals in non-critical projects. While the deal pipeline and deal wins (Q1 deal TCV of USD10.2b, book-to-bill at 1.4x) are good, smaller discretionary projects are getting impacted. 1Q EBIT margin declined by 130bp (to 23.2%) due to seasonal wage hikes and was in line with our estimate. The management expects margins to improve gradually over the next three quarters, in line with past trends.



Outlook

We have largely maintained our FY24/FY25 EPS estimates. Our TP of INR3,790 implies 25x FY25E EPS (16% upside). Reiterate BUY on the stock.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) CEO K Krithivasan remains unconcerned about the financial gains from the recent major deal with the government-owned telecom company, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL). Instead, the company's objective is focused on ""nation building,"" aligning with TCS's strategic approach to government projects, which emphasises more than just profit margins.

During an interview with Moneycontrol, Krithivasan stated, ""When considering the aspect of making money from the BSNL deal, there are two dimensions to consider. In the case of India, our perspective goes beyond mere financial gains. We consider ourselves an integral part of the nation-building process. We embrace this responsibility wholeheartedly, with our primary focus being on contributing to the development of our nation.""

“And so we believe that if TCS cannot do it who else can. For certain programs which nobody else can do, we cannot be asking whether we are making money, as long as we are not losing money,” he added.

A consortium led by TCS recently bagged an Advance Purchase Order (APO) valued at over Rs 15,000 crore (around $1.8 billion) from BSNL to deploy 4G networks across India. The consortium also includes Tata Group's telecom gear-making company Tejas Networks, which will be responsible for supplying and servicing the Radio Access Networks (RAN) equipment.

TCS’ approach towards government projects has always been a bit different compared to its other IT companies. The company has shown a better track record and success rate too in the industry for running public-facing government services portals.

TCS uses these projects as training grounds to learn from the complexity and replicate this in projects for various countries. The IT services firm doesn’t focus on profit margins alone for such deals, the key takeaway remains the understanding of scale that comes from working on these projects.

It already successfully runs the Indian Railways’ IRCTC site, and India Post’s digital project. TCS' contract for running the Passport Seva Programme was renewed last year in a deal worth Rs. 8,000 crores, according to industry sources.

While for the overall IT services sector where the US and Europe are the key markets, India contributes less than 5 percent of the top IT firms’ revenue. Among them, TCS reported the highest contribution of revenue coming from India at 5 percent in FY23.

In comparison, Infosys earned 3.2 percent and Wipro reported 4 percent revenue from India respectively in FY23.

TCS reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 on July 12. The company’s performance remained muted on several counts amid increasing pressure in key segments such as financial services, hi-tech and telecom. The EBIT margins too were 130 bps to 23.2% on a QoQ basis, far from its aspirational 26-28% range.

The company’s revenue in dollar terms stood at $7.22 billion, in line with analyst estimates. Overall revenue growth for Q1 came in at 0.4 percent, its slowest in a decade excluding the Covid period, but the subdued earnings were on expected lines.",494,0.32711611191431683

Revenue in US Dollar terms stood at $7.22 billion, which was in-line with the $7.23 billion figure expected from a CNBC-TV18 poll. On a sequential basis, growth in US Dollar terms stood at 0.4 percent on a sequential basis, compared to expectations of 0.5 percent.

While TCS' revenue growth for the first quarter, at 0.4%, was the slowest in a decade excluding the Covid period, the subdued earnings were on expected lines.

""Double digit growth could become difficult. It’s pure maths. If you start off at zero, you’ll have to do something extraordinary in the back end. It doesn’t make it very easy to achieve double digit growth…but it’s aspirational. We will continue to translate every opportunity into growth. We will galvanise our team towards it,"" Krithivasan said during the interview.

He further said that he has been meeting clients in the Europe, UK and the US in the last 6-8 weeks. ""We are happy with the strength of the relationship they share with TCS. There will be certain areas where they will pause spending and certain areas where they will spend. Programs with well-defined return on investment will continue. Clients also look at cost optimization projects. Customers would want to consolidate more with us because we give better value.""

He expects growth momentum to return once uncertainty ends in major markets such as the US and added that they will have better visibility in the second half of the year in a quarter or two. He however said that no clients are asking for discounts at this point and also said the company continues to aspire for a margin band of 26-28%, though it is currently in the 23% range.

""We are very confident that a 26-28 percent margin is still achievable. There are always reasons why we are not doing it. We are well poised to be in the 26-28 range. There are one off challenges that come once in a while"", he said.

TCS' order book for the quarter stood at $10.2 billion, which is the highest in five quarters. Krithivasan said he confident about having a strong order book going ahead.",475,0.24616026133298874

In response to a question at the company's Q1FY24 earnings conference on July 12, Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said that it will continue to honour all offers it has made.

""There are certain delays because of the environment we are in because of the project delays...things are not getting progressed [in some cases]. As a result of that, the onboarding of those associates also gets delayed. In certain cases that is getting delayed, yes, but that is purely based on the project's budget situation. I commit today that we are going to honour all offers,"" Lakkad said.

Moneycontrol first reported on the delays in onboarding lateral hires by TCS on July 10. Joinees with experience anywhere from less than two years to up to 15 years were told that their date of joining will be postponed by a quarter or three months amidst project commencement delays, those impacted told Moneycontrol.

Over 200 lateral recruits across cities such as Bangalore, Pune, Kochi, Bhubaneswar, Delhi NCR, and Indore, to name a few, are getting impacted by these deferments.

The majority of these joinees got their offer letters between January and April and their onboarding was already delayed by a month initially. Further, many of them got two to three subsequent new joining dates before receiving a fresh email on July 10, informing them that their joining has been pushed to the fourth week of October.

These recruits who left their previous organisations will now be without a job for the next few months.

This comes less than a month after the IT services behemoth grappled with a hiring scam wherein it had to sack six employees from its Resource Management Group (RMG) for allegedly accepting bribes from partnering staffing firms in exchange of giving them preferential treatment and business while hiring and deploying temporary associates on projects. Three other employees of the RMG are still under investigation. The six staffing firms found to be involved were also banned.",377,-0.8404978036880493

In a move that brings cheer in an otherwise muted quarter, software firm TCS said it has given pay hikes to the tune of 12-15 for 'exceptional performers' and has kicked off its promotions cycle. The hikes were effective from April 1.

“We have given a 12-15 percent raise for exceptional performers in our latest annual compensation review, and also commenced the promotions cycle,” Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said in a statement.

In fact, the company’s margins saw an impact of 200bps due to the impact of wage hikes. In a statement, Chief Financial Officer Samir Seksaria said the company has rolled out hikes from April 1, and that the company’s operating margin of 23.2 percent reflects the 200bps impact of the hike. TCS saw its operating margin fall by 120 bps overall, from 24.5 percent last quarter to 23.2 percent this quarter.

In FY23, TCS employees in FY23 saw a median remuneration increase of 5.11 percent as per the company’s annual report.

The news of the hike comes at an interesting time when Infosys has deferred the hikes that it gives to non-senior employees in the first quarter of the year, as employees are yet to receive any information on the same.

Lakkad said in a statement that the IT major is focussing on bringing employees back to work — and 53 percent of the company’s workforce currently works out of the office for three days a week.

“We remain focused on developing, retaining and rewarding the best talent in the industry, and enhancing their effectiveness by bringing them back to office to foster our culture,” he said.

In addition, those in the company logged 12.7 million learning hours on upskilling in skills such as generative AI, cloud, data and analytics.

For the quarter, Infosys added 523 employees on a net basis quarter, when it has been deferring the onboarding on lateral recruits even as fresher onboarding delays continue.

Tata Consulting Services (TCS) Chief HR Officer Milind Lakkad on Wednesday said that the company's ""return to office' initiative has picked up pace, with 53 percent of the workforce already coming to work at the office thrice a week.

""We remain focused on developing, retaining, and rewarding the best talent in the industry, and enhancing their effectiveness by bringing them back to the office to foster our culture,"" Lakkad said. ""Our 'return to office' initiative is picking pace, with 55 percent of the workforce already in the office thrice a week.""

The HR head added that the company has given a 12-15 percent raise for exceptional performers in its latest annual compensation review and have begun to consider candidates for promotions.

""TCSers logged 12.7 million learning hours in upskilling themselves during the quarter in market-relevant skills like generative AI, cloud, data, and analytics. Our attrition continues to trend down and we expect it to be back in our industry-leading, long-term range in the second half of the year,"" Lakkad added.

The country's largest IT firm had last September asked employees to work in the office for at least three days a week, according to an internal mail shared with employees.

“Senior leaders of TCS have been working from TCS offices for a while now and our customers are also visiting TCS offices… Your respective managers will now roster you to work from the TCS office for at least 3 days in a week,” the company said in the mail. “Adherence to rostering is mandatory and will be tracked… any noncompliance will be taken seriously, and administrative measures may be applied.”

HR head Milind Lakkad's comment also comes amid speculations that the company has been witnessing a mass resignation of its women staff after it discontinued its work-from-home (WFH) policy.

Speaking to Moneycontrol in June, Lakkad did not specify the exact number of women who have resigned in the past year, but termed the trend as “unusual”. He suggested that the return-to-office policy could have been a factor for the higher number of resignations by women in the last financial year.

“Historically, women’s attrition at TCS has been similar or lower than men’s attrition, so this is unusual. There might be other reasons but intuitively, I would think working from home during the pandemic reset the domestic arrangements for some women, keeping them from returning to office even after everything normalised,” Lakkad said.

The total contract value (TCV) for Q1 was up by 24.39 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis as compared to $8.2 billion reported in Q1FY23. Last quarter, TCV stood at $10 billion.

The growth was driven by the UK market which grew at about 16.1 percent YoY in constant currency (CC) terms. Among major markets, North America grew 4.6 percent and Continental Europe grew 3.4 percent. In emerging markets, Middle East & Africa grew 15.2 percent, India grew 14 percent, Latin America grew 13.5 percent, and Asia Pacific grew 4.7 percent.

K Krithivasan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, said: “It is very satisfying to start the new fiscal year with a string of marquee deal wins. We remain confident in the longer-term demand for our services, driven by the emergence of newer technologies. We are investing early in building capabilities at scale on these new technologies, and in research and innovation, so we can maximize our participation in these opportunities.”

N Ganapathy Subramaniam, Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director, said: “Our products and platforms achieved major milestones during the quarter with several transformational engagements going live. In the UK Life and Pensions administration space, we signed three new deals on our digital insurance platform, making TCS the undisputed leader in this market on any metric.”

Subramaniam added, “We are proactively building differentiating capabilities in generative AI and actively working on such projects with our clients, delivering impact on technology, operations and client experience dimensions.”

Major deal wins this quarter include several billion dollar plus deals in the UK such as the $1.1 billion deal from UK’s National Employment Savings Trust, a $1 billion plus deal with Marks & Spencer, a 10-year contract with UK’s Teacher’s Pension Scheme and another deal with the Phoenix Group to name a few.

Closer home, a consortium led by TCS won a deal from government owned telco BSNL with an advance purchase order of $1.8 billion.

Amidst all of these deals, TCS also lost a $2 billion deal and a 10-year contract from US-based Transamerica Life Insurance, which it got in 2018.

During the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) last month, chairman N Chandrasekaran said that while TCS is well-positioned to benefit from the demand in the medium to long-term thanks to the company’s investment into technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, 5G etc.

“I believe that the growth for the medium to long term is going to be strong. But in the nearby quarters there will be volatility in different markets on customer spending, especially in discretionary projects. It will go across sectors—some places it will be BFSI, others it will be manufacturing or retail,” he said.",611,0.6351243636824868

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the first of the IT majors to report its earnings for the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, added 523 employees on a net basis during this quarter, a slight decline from last quarter’s net addition of 821 employees.

With this, the company’s headcount stood at 6,15,318 as of June 30, 2023. The slowdown in hiring is expected as the industry faces mounting macroeconomic headwinds leading to a demand environment.

The attrition levels of India’s largest IT services company dipped to 17.8 percent on the last-twelve-months basis, down from last quarter’s 20.1 percent.

The company has been slowing down its net addition significantly in the last few quarters, after it added a record number of employees in FY22. It added 22,600 employees on a net basis in all of FY23, as opposed to 1.03 lakh in FY22.

In the same quarter last year, TCS had added 14,136 employees to its rolls on a net basis.

The results seasons in IT services sector begins this week with large cap tech companies such as TCS, HCL Tech, Wipro and Infosys announcing their results. IT stocks have underperformed in the recent rally as analysts expect revenues to be under pressure because of a likely recession in the United States.

Derivatives outlook for IT sector

The IT index has been volatile in the July series, with open interest additions mostly on the bullish side. Some short covering occurred at the start of the series, followed by long additions in recent sessions.

""The major trend for Nifty IT remains consolidative and could only see deviation if the recent base at 28,300 gets breached. On the upside, its immediate resistance zone still holds at 31,200,"" stated Sacchitanand Uttekar, Vice President-Research & Data Analysis at Tradebulls Securities. He believes that TCS, Infosys, and Wipro, have been oscillating lower and have yet to experience a major reversal on the upside.

Arun Kumar Mantri, Founder of Mantri FinMart, believes that among the stocks in the benchmark index, Infosys and Tech Mahindra are expected to outperform, followed by mid-cap IT counters such as Coforge and Mphasis. He further stated that most of the negatives are already priced in, and the downside seems to be capped in the near term unless any major negative developments occur on the earnings front. HCL Tech has witnessed massive short additions, and any positive surprise may trigger short covering in the stock.

According to Santosh Pasi, derivatives trader and analyst, ""Considering CNX IT, it is looking sideways to a bullish outlook based on the weekly timeframe.""

Expected positions, target support and resistance levels ahead of earnings results

Tata Consultancy Services

“Based on the chart analysis, TCS is showing a sideways trend and is most likely to continue. For TCS, we are expecting it sideways between 3.200 and 3.400. We will prefer to go for non-directional strategies like Short Iron Condo,"" according to Santosh Pasi

As per Arun Mantri, “TCS is exactly placed in the mid of the trading band with very lighter positions in the July series. The counter may undergo range expansion in the near term after the recent consolidation and muted price action. The key support is placed around 3,190 and 3,150 while resistance is around 3,320 and 3,380 levels.”

HCL Tech

HCL Tech is currently around the cluster of major short-term moving averages and has witnessed significant short additions in the last few sessions, with heavy call writing in the at-the-money call options. The counter has support around the 1,070-1,080 area, while resistance is in the 1,160-1,200 range. Any positive development may trigger a short squeeze in the counter, and traders should maintain a clear focus, according to the founder of Mantri FinMart.

Meanwhile, Santosh Pasi expects sideways to bullish momentum for HCL Tech, with support at 1,100 and resistance around 1,200 levels

Wipro

According to analysts, Wipro is an under-owned counter in the derivative space and may witness some sparks if the stock decisively crosses the 400 mark. Historically, in the last two quarters, the stock has provided positive returns in the range of 2-3 percent post-earnings. The support for the stock is around 380, while resistance is at 415-425 levels. Analysts expect the stock to remain between 370 and 410.

Infosys

For Infosys, analysts expect a bullish trend and anticipate it to reach a target price of Rs 1,400. The results for the counter are due in the middle of the next week, and its support levels are placed at 1,320 and 1,295, while resistance is around 1,370 and 1,420 marks.

Option Trading Strategy Recommendation

A short iron condor spread is a four leg strategy wherein, the investor sells one call while buying another call with a higher strike and sells one put while buying another put with a lower strike. Typically, the call strikes are above and the put strikes below the current level of underlying stock, and the distance between the call strikes equals the distance between the put strikes. All the options must be of the same expiration.

The Broken Wing Condor Spread is simply a condor Spread which has risk inclined to one side.

The protective put strategy is a hedging strategy used to protect an existing long position in the market. In a protective put the holder of a security buys a put option to protect himself against a drop in price.

The market’s upward momentum has primarily been driven by P/E expansion and significant foreign institutional investor (FII) buying, rather than robust earnings growth. Consequently, the question arises as to when the underlying fundamentals will align with the market’s exuberance. Investing at these levels may not offer an optimal risk-adjusted return, given the inflated valuations and uncertainty surrounding future earnings. As a result, some experts say it would be advisable to approach the current market conditions with caution, preserve resources, and await a more favourable opportunity to enter the market.

Ajay Srivastava of Dimensions Corporate Finance swears by legendary investor Warren Buffett’s ’Never lose money rule’, and says one must avoid losses more than go for returns.

Edited excerpts from an interview:

The Nifty has hit a new high of 19,500. How should investors approach the market now — wait for another 400-500 point fall on the Nifty to get in? Or would you say this is the time to actually go all in?

This rally has been all about P/E expansion. It’s not been about earnings. Nobody is expecting earnings to go up in this country. It’s all about P/E expansion, it’s all about FII buying. The question is, when you buy at these prices, would you get an adequate risk adjusted return on your capital? The answer, perhaps, may be ’no’ at this point of time, in terms of the fundamentals.

I would say if you are a risk adjusted return basis investor, why would you want to put your money at risk at these levels? Yes, there is momentum, yes there is FII buying, but would you be the lucky one to buy into a P/E expansion of this magnitude? Some Indian stocks have got P/Es of 100, 80, 70... you just name it, it’s all over the place. I would simply say, wait and keep your powder dry, there will be time to buy. And that would really be a good time to buy and make returns. Would you make a 20 percent return in the market at these levels? I have my doubts. So, don’t do what you would do today in a hurry. Relax, if you’re already invested, enjoy the ride and see where you can book your profit. But at this point of time I would certainly not recommend a big commitment.

IT heavyweights kick off the earnings season this week. There are no great expectations from largecap IT companies amid the slowdown in discretionary spending by clients. Do you think much of it is already priced in? Would you say this is the right time to actually buy IT stocks and wait for things to pick up?

See, I don’t know if the second half will be good or bad, because that’s not the news we’re getting from any of the IT companies at this point. They’re saying the deal flow is even, if not great. There is no customer loss, there is no attrition thus far. But I think adding customers is a bit of a problem today. So, growth is a problem.

Yes, customer losses are being stemmed and projects are being extended. It is one sector where every time there’s a big correction, we recommend our investors keep buying into it. You never know what’s a market bottom — these companies are good companies. These companies are strong cash-flow driven companies.

They have got global monopolies. There are very few Indian companies who are number three or number four globally. You can’t run away from the fact that IT is required. Yes, AI will come in, yes there’ll be a lot of dislocation, but the key factor is the biggest raw material for these big companies is people cost. I think that is where the control has come in.

You may find that the volume expansion may be restricted in this company for the next one year, but EBIT margin expansion is going to come through for this company. Unlike the rest of the Indian basket, where we are going to see a margin contraction in all consumer companies, you might even see de-growth (contraction) in India. But in IT companies, you might see the reverse.. that volume may be a little bit sluggish, but margins are higher because now they have got real control over the people cost.

So, people costs, which were going haywire over two years, have now come under control. Attrition is down, people are moving less in IT companies. So, one would tend to believe a wager on … EBIT expansion (being) faster than a volume expansion.

Tata Motors has turned the corner given the fact that the recent JLR sales data were pretty encouraging. Analysts believe that good times are ahead for the automaker. In fact, it may be on track to turn net zero debt this fiscal year itself. What’s your view? How does it stack up versus the likes of Maruti or M&M?

Tata Motors should never be viewed as a domestic stock at the end of the day. It’s a global stock. So, one would not tend to make them as a peer to Maruti or a Mahindra, etc. To an extent, their domestic sales are pretty good and they have been around in the market. But let’s examine what’s happening globally. Globally, the product line, more than anything, is very strong at this point. Their cars are strong, Land Rover is doing well, the Defender is also very strong. I think that’s where the traction is because there’s a premium on their products in the market.

The SUVs and the upper-end SUVs have a very good run for the time being, because the products are doing well in the market. I would not equate them with the domestic Indian market, which is sluggish, to say the least. Certain models are flying off. (Mahindra) Thar had a booking of two-three lakh and then it disappeared and then discounts appeared on some models. So, I am not too sanguine on what’s happening inside the Indian domestic market, because a lot is said about long waiting queues. But six months down the line, you see the queues have disappeared.

Tata Motors is a global story of a global brand. And that is where the traction would come from. Indian stories, I think, would see muted demand. Stocks are expensive at this point. Whether you talk to the biggest one with tractors or with autos, I think they are overcooked as a story for the time being. Sure, you can buy, sure the prices can go up… nobody argues with the market. But I doubt whether the fundamentals would go with it, given what’s happened to the economy today. The flood situation, the demand, the dislocation, the inflation, all put together, I don’t see demand in the market.

I’ve travelled a lot in the last 30 days globally. Domestically, there is no demand in the system for consumer products. I would be keeping out of these companies in domestic stories for the time being because demand is poor. Tata Motors is a global story. So, evaluate it from a global perspective of a top-quality brand. I think those SUVs are really doing wonders in the global markets.

Would you say that manufacturing is one pocket that would emerge as the next big thing, given the fact that there is a capex push by the government as we enter into an election year. Some big-ticket deals have been inked in the defence space as well. So, would you look at some of these manufacturing names now emerging as a big theme?

You just saw the IPOs recently and you saw the valuation of the companies post the IPO. I think in a state of inebriated exuberance, one would not even buy at that price. But people are buying and people are investing at those prices, one can’t argue with that.

If you look at the valuation of defence companies, which are primarily PSU firms ... it’s incredible. You can keep buying it, you can keep holding it. But is this valuation justified? So, I don’t think there is a story out there in manufacturing, because what are the valuations at which you are investing in these companies.

If you look at speciality companies, chemical companies, valuations were astronomical, and you saw the correction that happened there. You’ve also seen how the multiplex story has unfolded. The valuation became incredibly crazy. And today, if you had bought PVR, Inox at 1,800, 1,900 or 2,000, you’d be ruing the fact that the market is at a new high and how this particular story is playing out.

So, the question is not about whether the sector will do well or not; the question is are you buying at the right price in this market? Is this pricing fundamentally good vis-a-vis what is expected out of these industries? Certainly manufacturing cannot do much better than it is doing today. Because India is going to grow 6.5–7 percent at best.

The infrastructure story is good, no doubt. But the fact is that money is being spent on things like roads in places where the traffic density is almost zero. The infrastructure multiplier will come only if it is spent in the right place. In our view, yes, it’s a good story but the constraint is in urban infrastructure.

So, my personal view is at 6.5% economic growth, and at this valuation of manufacturing companies, I do not see a connect to buy at this juncture. If they are much cheaper, then perhaps yes, but not at this juncture. I would wait it out. Yes, there could be an increase in share price. But as Warren Buffett says, avoid losses more than go for returns.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is holding up onboarding of lateral hires with 1.8 to up to 15 years of experience by three months amidst project commencement delays, multiple sources in the know told Moneycontrol. This is coming at a time when the Indian IT sector has already taken a hit by macroeconomic headwinds and is facing project deferrals and ramp-downs as their clients cut down on tech budgets.

Over 200 lateral recruits across cities including Bangalore, Pune, Kochi, Bhubaneswar, Delhi NCR, and Indore to name a few are impacted by the delays.

These joinees were hired between January and April and were initially facing onboarding delays by a month. Many of them got two to three subsequent new joining dates. On July 10, however, many received emails stating that their joining dates are getting pushed to October.

The information about a deferral in onboarding date hasn’t even been communicated proactively to those waiting to join the company, according to multiple people Moneycontrol spoke to.

One of the impacted employees who has over 10 years of experience, was recruited for a particular project. In fact, he tells Moneycontrol that the company repeatedly followed up with him during his notice period to ensure that he was joining, but come last week, there was no word on his onboarding formalities.

“It’s when I started following up with them that I got to know that my onboarding date has been deferred. When I asked them what the reason was, they said they were informed by the management last week that onboarding will be done in phases. But they aren’t confirming any date,” he says.

Having worked with several IT majors, he adds that he has never seen these kinds of issues in other companies.

“I’m jobless now and I’m looking out again. In the current market, getting a job at my level of experience is also very tough. There’s a family to take care of, kids, loans on my head. It’s a very tough situation. I can hardly manage for a month,” he says.

Another impacted joinees was hired at a 65 percent pay hike from a rival top IT firm. This person’s last date at the previous organisation was in the fourth week of May.

“They were hiring aggressively in January and February. They offered good hikes too. My last day of work was in the fourth week of May in the previous organisation. And I was to join TCS in the second week of June. Suddenly in mid-May, I received an email from HR that my new joining date will be in the second week of July because of project commencement issues,” the person told Moneycontrol seeking anonymity.

“My family and colleagues advised me to wait given TCS’ good reputation. The company also started re-onboarding people after June 20. Until today, July 10, onboarding happened. But I got a call later in the day saying that my joining has been deferred to the next quarter, to the first week of October. I have a family to feed, how will I manage? I have started looking out for jobs now,” the person added.

According to TCS’ LinkedIn page, the company has around 5,296 open jobs to be filled in. Queries sent to TCS didn’t elicit any response at the time of publishing and will be updated if the company chooses to respond.

A third employee with less than two years of experience has seen his onboarding date changed for the fourth time, after being laid off by his previous company earlier this year. When he asked the reason behind the same, he was informed that this was a decision taken by the top management.

Upon reaching out over a possible onboarding delay, those waiting have received emails stating that as discussed, their date of joining is rescheduled and that the new date will be reflected on TCS’ portal later.

Grappling with hiring scam

This development is happening while TCS is already grappling with another major hiring scam that came to light less than a month ago. Several staffing firms were found to be bribing senior TCS executives in the company’s Resource Management Group (RMG) which outsources and deploys temporary associates on a project basis, to get preferential business opportunities.

In relation to this, TCS sacked six employees and banned six staffing firms. Another three employees are being investigated.

TCS chairman N Chandrasekaran also said that the company is now looking into the entire supply management process to examine “what the weaknesses are, and will completely tidy the process to ensure that they do not have such incidents.”

Volatility in demand

Even as TCS bagged a few major deals and renewals with its existing UK clients, Chandrasekaran had alluded to difficulties and volatility in demand from customers in the near term.

“When there is uncertainty in the global economic situation and higher inflation or slowing growth, companies will calibrate their spending. Whether it will happen in this quarter or after two quarters, it will happen. So certain discretionary spending companies will make a choice. It also depends on the amount of capital they want to spend at this point in time,” he had said.",867,-0.9932670990626017
2023-07-10 12:41:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-q1fy24-earnings-five-things-to-watch-out-for-10931861.html,"Tata Consultancy Services is set to announce its Q1FY24 earnings on July 12.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is set to kickstart the IT sector earnings season on July 12. This will be the first quarter its new CEO K Krithivasan directly addressing the earnings conference. All eyes will be on Krithivasan’s commentary on his vision for the company and any likely strategy changes.

Analysts expect the first quarter ended June 30, 2023 will be subdued for all IT companies, with slowing demand and several macroeconomic challenges leading to client companies rethinking tech budgets. Cost take out deals and vendor consolidation deals will still continue to drive demand.

EBIT margins or operating margins for most companies are expected to remain flat while, TCS will see a decline due to its recent wage hikes.

Here are the five themes to watch out for in TCS Q1 earnings performance:

Revenue Growth

According to analyst estimates, TCS will report flat to 0.2 percent revenue growth QoQ in constant currency terms, hit by weak discretionary spending, projects being put on hold and other macroeconomic challenges in geographies like North America and Continental Europe.

The company also missed its EBIT margin guidance of 25 percent in Q4 touching 24.5 percent, this might slip further by 80-90 bps in Q1FY24, driven by wage hikes announced in April. Whether the company will now update its margin guidance or stick to the previous benchmark and the available levers that would propel the company’s margins in the future.

Demand Outlook

During its recent AGM, Chairman N Chandrasekaran already cautioned shareholders of the uncertainties in the global economic situation, higher inflation etc. He said that client companies will calibrate their spending in the near-term, depending on the sizes of their allocated tech budgets.

While he is bullish in the mid- to long-term, there is a slowdown expected in discretionary spending in the near term. Commentary on sectors like BFSI, retail and telecom which have already showed decline in revenue growth in the past four quarters, will be watched out for.

Having said that, TCS bagged several billion dollar plus and long-term deals in the United Kingdom this quarter. This include a $1.1 billion deal from UK’s NEST, a $1 billion plus deal with Marks & Spencer, a 10-year contract with UK’s Teacher’s Pension Scheme and another deal with the Phoenix Group to name a few. Closer home, a consortium led by TCS won a deal from government owned telco BSNL with an advance purchase order of $1.8 billion.

Amidst all of these deals, TCS also lost a $2 billion deal and a 10-year contract from US-based Transamerica Life Insurance, which it got in 2018.

“Demand uncertainty seen in month of March has continued in Jun’23 quarter. TCS is seeing some project cancellations and postponements. Some right-shifted projects have started ramping up in June. Europe and UK are growing well while there is more weakness in North America,” analysts at ICICI Securities.

TCS so far maintained its quarterly total contract value of deals in its guidance of $7-9 billion.

Push for AI offerings

TCS is largely focusing on its newer technology offerings like artificial intelligence for next phase of growth.

Krithivasan in the company’s annual report said, “As part of their continuing digital transformation journey, we see sustained focus on cloud adoption, data architecture, customer experience and business model transformation.”

“On top of these current focus areas, technologies like 5G, IoT, generative AI, virtual reality / metaverse, digital twin and others are also gaining attention and are likely to attract investments in the short to medium term,” he added.

TCS recently partnered with Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure Open AI to develop industry-specific use cases. TCS even launched its own generative AI offering, and plans to train 25,000 employees in AI technology apart from the 50,000 existing associates.

Sectorial pressures

Sectors like banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), tech and communications, retail and manufacturing have shown a steady decline in quarterly revenue growth over the past four quarters.

BFSI, which contributes around 35-40 percent of TCS’ revenue, was also hit by the global banking crisis earlier this year when Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and the First Republic Bank in the US. Though there were no direct impact on TCS’ business, clients in the BFSI sector are slowing down tech spending.

As clients increasingly cut down on discretionary spending, telecom, tech and communications are taking a hit.

Hiring trends

TCS added 22,600 employees in FY23, a significant decrease from the 1.03 lakh net employee addition in FY22. Indian IT companies have been stating that the co-relation between revenue growth and hiring have started to become non-linear, as these companies increase focus on improving utilisation of the existing talent.

During TCS’ earnings conference last quarter, CHRO Milind Lakkad had shared that the company has already rolled out offers to 46,000 freshers for the FY24. In the past couple of quarters, TCS had steadily decreased its attrition rates. Lakkad expects TCS will reach its pre-pandemic attrition rate of 12-13 percent by the second half of FY24.

Unlike delays and variable pay cuts seen with certain peers, TCS has been consistent in paying out timely variable pay, at least for the junior staff. Last quarter, the company paid out 100 percent of the variable pay and said that the upcoming hikes for high performers will be at 12-15 percent, as is standard. Other hike bands are 8 percent, 5 percent and 1.5 percent.

While last fiscal year was the time for bettering utilisation rates, this year could be about ramping up and training talent to meet demand for AI projects. As the first quarter of the fiscal year, hiring targets will be of utmost focus.

Indian IT services companies are expected to log a muted show in June quarter with wage hikes keeping margins under pressure amid weak macro overhang, cuts in discretionary spends, and project delays, say analysts.

Some brokerages, in fact, have cautioned that pain will continue for the tech pack up ahead, as recovery is likely to be more gradual, only around the fourth quarter of financial year 2024 or in financial year 2025.

As tech companies head into Q1 earnings season this week, experts will also be keeping a close watch on any management commentary on the revision of the growth outlook for FY24, the spread of demand deterioration beyond BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance), hi-tech, telecom and retail verticals, net hiring, project ramp downs and pricing pressures, as key monitorables.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Tech are scheduled to declare their results on July 12, followed by Wipro’s report card a day later.

Infosys will announce its Q1 numbers on July 20, while LTIMindtree is slated to do so on July 17.

""Overall the weakness in demand should continue in Q1FY24 with a significant hit on discretionary spends. Clients continue to focus on cost and efficiency-driven projects, while keeping the non-critical projects on hold,"" Motilal Oswal said in its note.

While the deal pipeline remains healthy, weak macro will continue to impact revenue conversions, creating near-term pressure on revenues. BFSI, retail, hi-tech, and manufacturing continue to exhibit sluggish performance. The demand in the US has deteriorated due to increasing inflation and declining consumer spending, it said, noting that on the other hand, demand in Europe is relatively stable, similar to the levels in 4QFY23, and deal closures are progressing at a faster pace than in the US.

""Our IT services coverage universe is expected to deliver a weak median revenue growth of 0.4 percent QoQ and 5.3 per cent YoY in 1QFY24,” the brokerage said.

The demand remains intact for selective verticals and service lines, but there is a near-term weakness due to approval delays and heightened deal scrutiny.

""These factors may result in project deferrals and temporary pauses in project execution. Given the further deterioration in demand environment in 1QFY24, we do not anticipate a recovery in 2HFY24,"" it said, adding, recovery is expected to be more gradual in nature and should occur only in FY25.

Analysts are of the view that margins will see an impact from wage hikes growth moderation, though easing attrition, and better utilisation may partially offset the impact.

Sharekhan (by BNP Paribas) expects a tepid Q1 owing to the spillover of a soft demand environment given the continuity of weak macros. ""We expect quarter-on-quarter constant currency (CC) revenue growth of -1.9 percent to 1.2 percent for Tier-1 companies and 0.7 -3 percent (ex LTTS) for Tier-2 companies,"" it noted.

The brokerage too believes recovery would be gradual and is likely to get pushed further into Q4FY24, given the uncertain macro environment and no signs of pick-up in tech spends in the near term.

The depreciation of the dollar against the Euro and pound is expected to provide cross-currency tailwinds and assist in marginally elevating the dollar reported revenues of the IT service companies.

Emkay Global too sees softer revenue growth in Q1 on account of weaker discretionary spending, delay in decision-making and slower ramp-ups, pockets of weakness (BFS, retail, hi-tech, telcos) and increased caution by clients amid macro headwinds.

""Any revision of FY24 revenue growth/margin guidance, demand trends in key verticals, deal intake in Q1 and pipeline, smaller deal flow and discretionary spends, pricing environment and deal mix shift towards cost takeouts and consolidation, will be key monitorables,"" it stated.

The market will also await management take on demand trends cutting across geographies, as well as update on project delay, deferral, or cancellation due to macro uncertainties, hiring plan amid slowing growth and uncertain demand outlook.",646,-0.7367974434580121
2023-07-07 14:14:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/cant-rule-out-1000-point-correction-in-nifty-see-opportunity-in-it-ambareesh-baliga-10921371.html,"Indian markets on a record-setting spree

Indian equity markets have been consistently hitting record highs, with the Nifty recently surpassing the psychological 19,500 level. A combination of factors is driving this stellar run on Dalal Street. Strong foreign institutional investor (FII) inflows, controlled inflation, and consistent growth in corporate earnings have significantly boosted confidence in the Indian equities market. International investors have shown increasing interest, leading to inflows totalling more than $3.5 billion. These positive macroeconomic fundamentals reflect India's attractiveness as an investment destination.

Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market expert, believes that valuations may be turning frothy as the Nifty continues to break milestones and make its way towards the 20,000 mark. In an interview with Moneycontrol, he says that after the rip-roaring rally a correction of over 1,000 points could be on the cards for Nifty. And that, he believes, would present an opportunity to buy into the market. Edited excerpts:

Indian markets have been on a tear with no signs of cooling off. What is your take on the markets now?

At this point of time, I'm finding the markets are getting a bit too frothy, especially on the mid and small-cap side. Clearly, liquidity has been driving the markets as there are speculators who are getting into investing mode and that seems to be revving up the markets. So it is getting a bit expensive but at some point of time we'll see a correction.

And that correction also can be quite deep, because the market was decently valued when the Nifty was at about 18,500-18,600. But at these levels, if you see a correction, it could be possibly a bit deeper, and it could be in excess of 1,000 points. I see the markets possibly correcting to levels of 18,200 -18,400. So that will not be a small dip. I think it'll be a decent correction.

Earnings season is kicking off next week with IT majors slated to report Q1 numbers. Interestingly, this time even before the Q1 numbers have come out, brokerages have further downgraded EPS for some of the IT names. In the last quarter it was the impact of the SVB crisis, but what could be the reason for downgrades this time around?

I don't think it's another crisis. We've seen a crisis earlier. But now, the effect of the crisis is playing out with lower-order flows. There have been a couple of large orders which have been cancelled, especially in the case of TCS. So I think because of this, we are seeing those downgrades, and possibly we can see that effect, at least for the next one or two quarters.

I think the pressure will still be on for a while. But possibly over the next one or two quarters, there could be those pockets of opportunity in IT because of the underperformance seen in the last about 12 to 18 months, I think there'll be some opportunity in the IT space over the next two quarters.

Let's talk about the premium bike segment. An intense price war has broken out in this segment. Of course, Royal Enfield has been the undisputed leader but now we have entrants like Hero Motocorp and Bajaj Auto. How much of a threat is it for Eicher?

Eicher’s dominance will continue for a while longer but clearly, there will be margin pressure. Because today a buyer has a decent amount of choice, because of which we could see the numbers being hit. So I won’t be surprised if you see a further cut in Eicher’s share price. In fact, I'm looking at a price which is possibly below Rs 3,000. So even at these levels, I would suggest that if one is holding Eicher, possibly it is time to book out.

What are your thoughts on the spirit makers? In the fourth quarter these companies saw margin erosion on the back of higher raw material prices. But analysts expect the first quarter to be extremely high-spirited.

One should look at a stock like United Spirits, which I think will continue to do well because they are more on the high margin sort of business with premium brands. So I think that's one stock which should continue to do well.

We have seen stocks like DLF hitting fresh 52-week highs. How would you view the current realty rally?

The real estate rally should continue, at least in the foreseeable future because there's real demand at the ground level, especially in the affordable housing space. In fact, I see a decent amount of demand coming in. Interest rates should start coming down possibly by January 2024, at least in India.

That would be the next big trigger for the real estate space, especially affordable housing. So other than DLF and Godrej Properties, one should look at pure-play affordable housing names as well. One stock which comes to my mind is Arihant Superstructures, which is purely into this space. This is one stock which can possibly give decent returns, at least in the foreseeable future of the next two to three years.

What do you think about tyre companies? We have seen the likes of Ceat, Apollo Tyres and JK Tyre perk up quite a bit.

I liked all these three stocks sometime back but with the sort of rally we've seen in the past couple of days, I think they are more than fully priced. So at this point of time, I'm not really going for a fresh pick in the tyre space. But I suppose in the battery space, there's still some more upside left. So one should look at stocks like Exide and Amara Raja. Possibly, we can have another 15-18 percent rally in this space over the next two to three months.

Weak demand resulting out of recession fears in the US and the recent wage hikes are expected to pressure first-quarter earnings of Indian information technology companies, analysts tracking the IT sector have observed.

In their first quarter preview for the sector, brokerages noted that the orders from the banking and financial services sector, which contributes nearly 30 percent to the IT companies' earnings, are yet to rebound. In addition to the prevaling scenario, declining consumer spending and weak demand from the North American region have only made things tougher for tech companies.

Like was the trend during the March quarter, analysts again see Tier 2 IT companies faring better than Tier 1 players.

Tier-1 vs Tier-2

According to Motilal Oswal, Tier-2 IT companies are expected to outperform their bigger peers by registering a 2.8 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) revenue growth compared to Tier-1 companies, which are expected grow merely by 0.2 percent.

Among Tier-2 IT companies, L&T Technology Services (LTTS) is expected to register an impressive growth of 12.2 percent QoQ on account of its recent acquisition of Smart World and Communications (SWC), its sister business from L&T. Apart from LTTS, Persistent Systems and Coforge are expected to grow by 3.3 percent and 3.2 percent QoQ .

Among the Tier-1 majors, revenue figures for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) are expected to be flat due to weak discretionary spending and wage hikes.

Most analysts also see Tech Mahindra and Wipro seeing a decline in revenues. Kotak Institutional Equities sees a sharp QoQ decline in Tech Mahindra revenues to 1.8 percent owing to a sluggish deal pipeline for its communications vertical, while Wipro IT is expected to slide to 1.9 percent.

In terms of the PAT (profit after taxes) too, the bottomline figures for Tier-1 IT majors are expected to decline by 2.3 percent QoQ contrary to the expectations for Tier-2 which is expected to see an aggregate rise of 6.8 percent QoQ, Motilal Oswal noted.

Margin pressure

A weak topline and wage hikes are expected to hurt the profit margins of IT companies. Foreign broking firm Jefferies in its preview for the sector observed, “Barring LTI Mindtree (LTIM), all companies should witness flat to declining margins in Q1FY24.” Coforge, TCS and Tech Mahindra will see highest margin contraction on account of wage hikes, it further noted.

According to Motilal Oswal, while services and consultancy giant TCS is expected to see a 140 basis points margin decline QoQ, LTIM on the other hand is expected to expand its margin by 30 basis points.

Bias for Tier-1

Although Tier-2 IT companies are expected to fare better, many brokerages prefer to place their bets on Tier-1 companies. Analysts point out that although the revenue numbers may disappoint, profit margins of these companies are expected to be better than those of Tier-2 companies.

EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) or operating profit for Tier-1 IT is expected to improve from 17.3 percent in Q4FY23 to 17.5 percent in Q1FY24. On the other hand, the Tier-2 IT margins are expected to slide to 14.9 percent in Q1FY24 as against 15.3 percent in Q1FY23.

Kotak Institutional Equities has placed Infosys and HCL Technologies (HCL Tech) at the top among its preferences. The domestic brokerage firm expects HCL Tech to retain its revenue growth guidance of 6-8 percent and 18-19 percent EBIT margin guidance for FY2024.

Motilal Oswal has recommended TCS as its top pick, considering a strong order book and expects the company to benefit in the long term. Analysts expect TCS to register strong TCV (total contract value) numbers, backed by the recent BSNL 5G deal win worth $1.83 billion and UK NEST deal worth $1 billion.

Long-drawn recovery

The market is divided on how soon the IT sector will recover. While analysts at BNP Paribas think it could be as soon as the second half of this fiscal, Motilal Oswal expects the recovery to be more gradual and to be complete only in FY25.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) announced plans to scale up its Azure Open AI expertise and plans to get 25,000 associates trained in Azure Open AI to help clients accelerate their adoption of this technology.

The IT behemoth will also launch its new Generative AI Enterprise Adoption offering on Microsoft Cloud.

This move is being made in order to help customers jumpstart their generative AI journey.

TCS has been helping clients strengthen their AI experience using its data analytics and AI services on the Microsoft cloud. A member of Microsoft’s AI Council and a Partner Designation in Data and AI, the company has obtained Microsoft specialisations in AI and machine learning and analytics on Azure.

The company has also launched its Generative AI Enterprise Adoption offering, which uses a proprietary transformation framework to bring together TCS’ knowledge and Azure Open AI service to help clients with customer service, new business models and more.

Siva Ganesan, Head of Microsoft Business Unit, TCS said, “Generative AI upends how enterprises can grow revenue, create new innovations, and get more work done — it’s a game-changer that has the potential to do all of this faster, better, and more cost-effectively.”

“With TCS Generative AI Enterprise Adoption, our joint customers can unlock new growth opportunities and embark on an exciting journey of innovation — guided by our AI expertise and in-depth knowledge of Microsoft Cloud,” he added.

Kelly Rogan, CVP, Global System Integrators and Advisory Partners, Microsoft, said, “TCS’ Generative AI Enterprise Adoption on Azure Offering provides customers with the information and resources they need to harness the power of generative AI to accelerate innovation and business growth.”",289,0.9295848846435547

The onus of deducting TCS should be banks, in case a person makes an overseas hotel booking using the e-commerce portal of tour operators, said a senior official of MakeMyTrip, a leading online travel service provider.

MakeMyTrip Group Vice President-Taxation Tajinder Singh said, in case a tour package is booked from the e-commerce portal, the company will take an undertaking from its customers, on whether the total amount remitted abroad so far has exceeded the threshold of Rs 7 lakh in the fiscal year.

The government has said that from October 1, a 5 per cent Tax Collected at Source (TCS) will be levied on tour packages up to Rs 7 lakh in a fiscal. The rate will go up to 20 per cent for spending beyond the threshold.

Currently, 5 per cent TCS is levied on overseas tour packages irrespective of spending.

Singh said TCS collection on overseas tour spendings has two aspects -- one where a tour package is booked using the e-commerce portal and secondly, when the customer uses the portal to make a standalone hotel booking.

He said in case of tour packages booked from an e-commerce website, the company will seek a declaration from customers about the total money remitted so far in a fiscal year.

In case of standalone hotel booking, he said it will fall in the category where authorised dealer banks would be responsible for taking this declaration from customers.

""We have been talking to banks that for these declarations, banks will have to come up with their own facility and infrastructure where they would be able to directly use the KYC data available of their customers to collect the information directly from customers. That is where we are pushing it to the banks to do the compliances at their end.

""It is the compliance of the banks. Banks are liable to collect the TCS from customers who are remitting outside India. The compliance is on banks, but because we are intermediaries we will have to pitch-in somewhere and facilitate this,"" Singh said.

The government's decision on levying higher TCS on overseas tour packages beyond Rs 7 lakh would impact outbound tourism.

""A lot of customers would be looking at the higher TCS rate as a cost... The higher cash outflow at the time of booking might pinch a lot of customers and they might curtail their expenditure,"" Singh added.",412,-0.7878532707691193

With the finance ministry delaying the implementation of higher Tax Collected at Source (TCS) on overseas spending to October 1, the tour operators have welcomed the decision saying it will give time to banks to develop the system. However, they added by stating that they do not have the bandwidth or resources to implement it.

“We welcome this as this benefits all the stakeholders, the financial system shall have the time to work out the system for implementation of the tax. Individuals, tour operators and even the government would benefit by the exemption of Rs 7 lakh being offered to all categories. For tour operators this is a major relief as TCS at the rate of 20 percent would have been ruinous for them. They would have gone out of business. Hopefully the banking system will be able to develop the system by October 1,” Rajiv Mehra, President, Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO), told Moneycontrol.

The government has clarified that international credit and debit card spends on foreign travel up to Rs 7 lakh will be excluded from the Liberated Remittance Scheme (LRS) limits and therefore won't attract TCS.

Burden of collection

However, it has also decided to increase TCS on international holiday packages to 20% for expenses beyond Rs 7 lakh, a significant increase from the current 5%. The basic purpose of the government was to bring more people into the tax net. The government is also looking to curb the excess spending people are engaging in while travelling abroad.

“The new taxation regime would put the onus of collection of tax on the tour operators for which tour operators neither have the bandwidth nor the resources required for implementing it. This would make things onerous and complex for tour operators,” he said.

In fact, IATO’s long standing demand is to bring TCS down to 2.5 percent, which Mehra said the association would continue to push for.

“The extension of the implementation of the new rule mandating a 20% TCS on overseas tours is viewed positively by travel industry bodies and companies. They see it as a relief, as the proper mechanisms for implementing these rules aren't yet in place. Banks and credit card companies are currently struggling to calculate the TCS component because the reporting systems are unprepared. We believe that the government needs to establish best practices and procedures, and not leave loose ends hanging. The extension has been requested to allow for these improvements and for the industry to prepare for the changes,” Jyoti Mayal , Vice Chairperson, Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism & Hospitality (FAITH), told Moneycontrol.



The finance ministry statement said that the industry, including banks and travel agents, need time to understand the implications of these changes and to modify existing agreements and employee policies accordingly. The aim is to go for a seamless transition to ensure that all parties are prepared for the upcoming changes.

“We have strongly expressed concern about implementing the new TCS rules without a proper mechanism in place. Industry representatives want the Rs 7 lakh TCS threshold limit to apply to all travel services and payment modes to ensure parity between domestic and overseas travel agents,” Mayal said.

Despite the extension of TCS implementation date, there are ongoing concerns and demands. Industry bodies and companies are seeking further clarification on the new rules and their implementation. They're seeking that the Rs 7 lakh TCS threshold limit apply to all travel services and payment modes.

“We have stated the need for the government to organise the systems and bring parity. The burden this places on travel agents, tour operators, and banks, who are deemed ill-prepared for this change, is also a significant concern. Therefore, while the extension is a step in the right direction, there are further demands and changes that industry representatives hope to see,” she said.

Banks and card companies would get time to build IT solutions required to implement this tax. However this should be fully withdrawn as the cost of compliance would far outweigh the tax collected, according to Ajay Prakash, Board Member, FAITH.

“Banks and card companies may get ready by this time but I doubt whether the tour operators can build a system to collect this tax. This is simply beyond their capacity and simply not their work. There needs to be reconsideration on this aspect,” he told Moneycontrol.

As per the latest clarification from the finance ministry, if a person is overseas and spends through the credit card, it would not count under LRS and therefore would not attract TCS even after October 1. Further, if a person uses credit card while in India for permissible overseas transactions, then that would count under LRS and attract TCS if it exceeds Rs 7 lakh in a year.

“There are too many lacunas as it means you can spend from international credit card without being subjected to TCS. This gap needs to be plugged. Extension is just a small relief. The burden of compliance remains on tour operators and it would be a very complex and costly exercise for the tour operators to act as tax collectors. This needs to be reconsidered,” he said.",879,-0.5488710641860962

Artificial intelligence (AI), the new tech frontier, has emerged as the key theme for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and rival Infosys as well and is expected to drive growth for India’s top two IT consultancy services as demand concerns weigh.

At their annual general meetings (AGMs), held a day apart, TCS and Infosys also agreed that the overall demand environment is expected to remain volatile amid macro-economic challenges.

Chairman N Chandrasekaran said that TCS was shifting gears to be more AI-centric.

“Over the past decade, there has been a rapid evolution of digital technologies, bringing about a transformation across every industry. Now, the advancements in AI have made AI transition a central focus…There is a transition already underway from predictive AI to generative AI,” he said on June 29.

Despite a volatile demand environment, at least in the short term, Chandrasekaran was bullish in the long term on growing adoption of predictive AI, generative AI, cloud and IoT by its client companies -- all the areas he believes TCS is strong in.

A day earlier, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh told shareholders that the company had already bagged 50 generative AI projects.

“We have today 50 active client projects where we are using generative AI and this is becoming an increasing part of the new world which is going to be defined on an AI-first basis,” he said.

Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani did flag practical, ethical and intellectual property-related concerns surrounding generative AI.

Chandrasekaran had a similar response when asked about the challenges of generative AI. He concurred that every technology has to be used responsibly, adding, “Countries across the globe will regulate generative AI to be used responsibly.”

In May, TCS and Infosys launched their generative AI offerings TCS Generative AI and Infosys Topaz.

Volatile demand environment

Infosys has already pegged its constant currency revenue growth guidance for FY24 in single digits at 4-7 percent.

Responding to shareholders, Nilekani said though the receding coronavirus pandemic ended one set of challenges, its aftermath created new ones.

“The cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency to resilience and security, all morphing quickly and without warning is upon us,” he said, adding they must be flexible.

TCS doesn’t give forward guidance but Chandrasekaran said he was bullish in the mid-to long-term as the company was well-positioned to capture the opportunities and growth coming from trends like artificial intelligence, energy transition, supply-chain shift and the need for new skills.

“I believe that the growth for medium to long term is going to be strong. But in the nearby quarters there will be volatility in different markets on customer spending, especially in discretionary projects. It will go across sectors—some places it will be BFSI, others it will be manufacturing or retail,” he said.

In times of uncertain global economic situation, higher inflation or slowing growth, companies would calibrate their spending, he said. “Whether it will happen in this quarter or after two quarters, it will happen. So certain discretionary spending companies will make a choice. It also depends on the amount of capital they want to spend at this point in time,” Chandrasekaran said.",537,-0.008497722446918488

An agreement with technology vendor Tata Consultancy Services will not help Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) recover the additional expenses it has paid 63 Moons Technologies till now for extending the contract, and also the future payments to it. This was told to analysts in separate calls over the last one month.

Between October 2022 and June 2023, MCX has paid around Rs 242 crore to 63 Moons for the extension of the contract, first for one quarter and then for two quarters. The contract has been extended for another couple of quarters till December 2023 for a charge of Rs 125 crore per quarter. All together, MCX will fork out around Rs 470 crore as additional expenses.

“There are penalty clauses. They will kick in obviously, but then, again, every penalty has a cap, you know. Obviously, they will not let go the complete development fee. It is that way. There are penalties, of course, not doubt,” the management said in a call with Franklin India Mutual Fund on June 1, according to the transcript of the call.

The company has not given details of the penalty clause. A questionnaire to MCX on this issue has not been answered so far.

63 Moons has been a long-term technology services provider to MCX – since 2003. However, MCX chose not to continue with its services and floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) in October 2020 for developing the Exchange’s Commodity Derivatives Platform (CDP) – about two years before the contract was supposed to expire.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) was selected eventually as the vendor for development of the CDP and issued a letter of intent for the same in February 2021. TCS, in September 2021, informed that it would help MCX to “transform the exchange’s core systems”.

MCX and TCS have been working on developing a new platform in which the trading software-T7-is from Deutsche Deutsche Börse Group, which operates Frankfurt Stock Exchange and the settlement software customised by TCS.

The platform was initially expected to go live by July 2022. Since then delays and “complexity in platform development and integration” have marred the deployment of software.

“When we gave the contract to TCS, there was hard bargaining. We won't be able to recover these additional expenses that are there, but there are penalty clauses,” the management said in a call with ICICI Prudential MF.

“It would be linked to the contract value. It is obviously not up to the contract value. There is a percentage that we can kick in, but it won't be substantial to recover the additional amount that we have paid,” the management said.",438,-0.9942975640296936

Even as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) remains resilient, the IT services major will see volatility in demand in the near term across different markets and customer spending, said chairman N Chandrasekaran, at a time when macroeconomic challenges are making the business environment tougher for IT services companies globally.

“I believe that the growth for medium to long term is going to be strong. But in the nearby quarters there will be volatility in different markets on customer spending, especially in discretionary projects. It will go across sectors—some places it will be BFSI, others it will be manufacturing or retail,” he told shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) on June 29.

According to Chandrasekaran, despite the near-term challenges the company is well-positioned to capture the opportunities and growth coming from trends like artificial intelligence, energy transition and supply chain shift and need for new skills and talent of the future. All of this will help the company grow eventually.

“Overall, whether it is cloud, IoT, predictive AI, generative AI etc., these are trends that augur extremely well for the company,” he said.

“Having said that, when there is uncertainty in the global economic situation and higher inflation or slowing growth, companies will calibrate their spending. Whether it will happen in this quarter or after two quarters, it will happen. So certain discretionary spending companies will make a choice. It also depends on the amount of capital they want to spend at this point in time,” Chandrasekaran observed.

FY23 performance

TCS remained resilient in terms of orders despite the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and geo-political tensions that have disrupted the smooth functioning of global supply chains.

“There has been a surge in inflation, especially in the developed markets. In this environment, the demand for your company’s services has shown remarkable resilience,” he said.

CEO K Krithivasan said, “Despite the macroeconomic overhang throughout the year, we recorded a strong order book throughout the year with a total TCV of $34.1 billion. It is important to note that we exited the year with an order book of $10 billion, the strongest in the four quarters, despite the banking crisis in the US and the resultant uncertainty.”

The company’s strong revenue growth came with industry-leading profitability, he said.

Key growth drivers in FY23 were M&A integration or divestitures, product or business model innovation, customer experience transformation, and data and analytics for improved decision-making. Cloud transformation too continues to aid growth with an emphasis on execution.

Bullish on AI

Chandrasekaran remained bullish on AI and said that TCS is now becoming more AI-centric.

“Over the past decade, there has been a rapid evolution of digital technologies, bringing about a transformation across every industry. Now, the advancements in AI have made AI transition a central focus…There is a transition already underway from predictive AI to generative AI,” he said.

The majority of businesses are still adopting predictive AI and are on the journey of capturing large volume of data, harnessing the power of cloud and IoT, Chandrasekaran said. There are varying levels of adoption in companies across sectors.

2023 so far

In the first six months of 2023, the company has managed to grab five large deals in the United Kingdom, where the company is the largest IT and software services provider.

These deals include a $1.1 billion contract with UK’s Nest, the $723-million deal from insurer Phoenix Group, the Marks & Spencer deal and the 10-year contract with the Teacher’s Pension Scheme in England and Wales, amidst a challenging macro environment in the region.

Meanwhile, in the US, a $2-billion deal and a 10-year contract with Transamerica Life Insurance were terminated, citing macro environment challenges and changing business priorities. TCS got the deal in 2018 and the pending work will be wrapped up in the next two and a half years.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) banned around six employees and six business associate (BA) firms or staffing firms in relation to the recruitment bribe case, said chairman N Chandrasekaran, addressing several reports and shareholder queries on the issue that came up during the IT services major’s annual general meeting (AGM) on June 29.

This was the first time that the senior-most executive from the company openly spoke about the entire investigation process in the case and the way forward, coming after nearly a week of discussions and speculations on the case.

Speaking to the shareholders, Chandrasekaran said, “We found six employees who did not follow ethical conduct. While we cannot quantify what favours they got but they certainly behaved in a way that they were favouring certain firms. We have banned all those six employees and six such BA companies. There are investigations pending on three more employees.”

The company is also looking at the whole BA supply management process to examine what the weaknesses are, and will completely tidy the process to ensure that we do not have such incidents, he said.

“For a Tata Group company, the most important thing expected of every employee is ethical conduct and integrity in operations. That comes ahead of any financial performance. So whenever there is a violation of ethical conduct by any employee, it pains me and all the leaders very deeply. We take it extremely seriously and will take very strong actions,” Chandrasekaran added.

What transpired?

According to Chandrasekaran, the wrongdoings were first pointed out by two whistle blowers in February and March.

“The complaints were about certain favouritism done and favours received in recruitment of business associates,” he said.

TCS has two departments for acquiring talent: the HR and talent acquisition which hires people and resource allocation group which deploys available resources into projects. Whenever there is a talent shortage or a particular skill is not available in a location, the company has a set of BA firms to get contract employees.

“At any point in time in the overall deployment of resources, about 2-3 percent of them are such BAs or contractors. The complaint was related to certain individuals in the company working with certain BA firms to be recruiting in their favour,” Chandrasekaran said.

He added, “There are a large number of BA firms that TCS works with. There is a rigorous process in the company to recruit or qualify a firm to be called a BA firm. There are about a little over 1,000 such firms globally because we need resources in 55 such countries. And each one of them does a certain amount of business depending on their skill availability.”

TCS ultimately found two such cases: one in India and the other one in the US. The India one was investigated by a senior executive in the company and the US one by an external official.

No key managerial person involved

Over the past few days, TCS had reportedly blacklisted several partnering staffing firms and sacked employees from its Resource Management Group (RMG) division in relation to allegedly charging commissions from the staffing firms in return of preferential treatment by giving them business.

Sources had earlier told Moneycontrol that the RMG division brought less than 1 percent of the company’s overall workforce and the financial impact arising out of these violations is likely to be minimal.

TCS later denied the allegations in a statement. ""The recruitment activities in TCS are not handled by the Resource Management Group (RMG) as alleged, therefore the reference to alleged scam in recruitment process is incorrect,"" it said.

The company had run an internal investigation on these charges after a whistle blower alerted CEO K Krithivasan and COO Natarajan Ganapathy Subramaniam. Sharing the findings of the same, TCS said that the issue relates to ""breach of Company’s Code of Conduct by certain employees and vendors providing contractors; and no key managerial person of the Company has been found to be involved.""

It does not involve ""any fraud by or against the Company and (has) no financial impact,"" it added.",680,-0.47699855268001556

Domestic tour operators on Thursday welcomed the government’s move to defer hike in tax collection at source on overseas tour packages till September 30 calling but reiterated that it should be brought down to 2.5 per cent.

In a statement, Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO) — the apex body of tour operators in the country with more than 1,700 members — thanked the government for ”giving partial relief of deferring Tax Collection at Source (TCS) on the overseas tour packages till September 30, 2023, and also for withdrawing increase of TCS percentage from 5 per cent to 20 per cent on amount up to Rs 7 lakh per annum”.

”Though we are happy with this rollback, our long-standing demand is that the TCS should be reduced to 2.5 per cent as the main objective of the government is to bring more people into the tax net…,” IATO President Rajiv Mehra said. He further said, ”…if the government reduces the TCS percentage on overseas tour packages, a higher number of people will book through the Indian tour operators who are registered in India, instead of booking tours directly with the foreign tour operators or booking online tour operators who are not registered in India and are not liable to collect tax at source.”

Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism and Hospitality (FAITH) Vice Chairperson Jyoti Mayal said as understood from the government circular, TCS will continue to be 5 per cent up to Rs 7 lakh per individual on outbound tours even after October 1, post which 20 per cent will be levied on Rs 7 lakh-plus spend.

”If this is so, then even if not a full relief this is partial relief for our travel agents on retaining their competitiveness somewhat against global players,” she said in a statement. However, Mayal added, ”I think the government needs to consider the compliance deliverables on the agents. The transaction needs to be under the purview of the traveller and the bank. The agents do not have so much back office support.”

The government on Wednesday dropped plans to levy tax collected at source (TCS) on overseas payments made through international credit cards and said such expenses will be included in the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the RBI. The Finance Ministry has also deferred by three months the implementation of a higher Tax Collected at Source (TCS) rate of 20 per cent on expenditures made under LRS and overseas tour packages till September 30. The new rates will come into effect from October 1.

Thomas Cook (India) Ltd Executive Director & CEO Mahesh Iyer said the government’s decision to defer increase in the tax collected at source to 20 per cent on expenditures made under the liberalised remittance scheme will help create a level playing field through discussion and inputs from relevant stakeholders.

”On behalf of the travel services industry, we welcome the government’s announcement to defer the proposed increase in the TCS rate for remittances under LRS to October 1, 2023,” Iyer said in a statement. Further, Iyer said, ”We appreciate the government’s initiative that will help create a level playing field – taking on board inputs from relevant stakeholders, including travel and authorised foreign exchange players.”

On the clarification regarding the threshold of Rs 7 lakh per individual per financial year across all modes of payment regardless of purpose, he said it ”will go a long way in aiding the buoyancy being witnessed in the travel industry, which is still recovering from two consecutive years of the impact of the global pandemic.”

Iyer said as India’s leading foreign exchange provider, Thomas Cook (India) believes that ”this positive announcement also brings in much-needed clarity with Prepaid Forex cards (the preferred mode of transactions for overseas travellers) now being treated on par with credit/debit cards.”

Earlier, domestic travel agents had pointed out that they were disadvantaged against overseas service providers even after the government’s clarification that it did not intend to levy TCS on small transactions and that payments made by individuals using their international debit or credit cards up to Rs 7 lakh for foreign travel per financial year will be excluded from LRS limits.",705,0.8738390803337097

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Standard Life International DAC (SLIDAC), a subsidiary of the Phoenix Group, on June 26 announced that they will collaborate on the latter's operating model and enhance the customer experience for policyholders in Europe.

To achieve this, TCS will leverage its Digital Platform for Life and Pensions, which is powered by TCS BaNCS, as per the filing to the exchanges.

TCS already has a strong partnership with the Phoenix Group in the UK, where its subsidiary, Diligenta, has successfully transformed operations and manages millions of policies. Building on this success, TCS and the Phoenix Group seek to extend the improved digital experience to policyholders in Germany, Austria, and other European markets, it added.

As part of the partnership, TCS plans to establish a customer operations centre in Germany and develop a Life and Pensions Digital Platform tailored for Germany and Austria, with potential expansion into additional European markets.

The initial phase involves migrating over 4,00,000 policies from SLIDAC's German and Austrian life and pension books to the TCS platform, with the aim of creating comprehensive digital experiences across multiple channels for policyholders and advisors.

TCS's platform provides flexibility and robust functionality, enabling SLIDAC to launch innovative products more efficiently, enhance risk management and controls, and ensure compliance with regulations.

This business transformation initiative will empower SLIDAC and the Phoenix Group to adapt swiftly to market changes and seize new growth opportunities within the European markets.

Nigel Dunne, CEO, Standard Life International DAC, said, “We continually review our operating model to ensure it is meeting the evolving needs of our customers on their journey to and through retirement. Leveraging the advantages of our strategic relationship with TCS will support our growth strategy in Europe and bring benefits to both our customers and advisers. This is a real opportunity to help us accelerate our ability to innovate and efficiently evolve our customer proposition in the future.”

“We are delighted to expand our long-standing partnership with the Phoenix Group to include SLIDAC’s policyholders in Europe and extend to them, the same digital omnichannel experiences that have made us a market leader in the UK. With TCS’ Digital Platform for Life and Pensions SLIDAC will have a future-ready digital core that enhances its agility and will support its growth aspirations in Europe,” said R Vivekanand, President, BFSI Products and Platforms at TCS.

The Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO) has written to the prime minister, seeking a rollback of the 20 percent tax collection at source (TCS) on the foreign travel packages, scheduled to kick in from July 1.

The IATO said that such a levy would hit the tourism sector’s revival from the pandemic blues as people would bypass domestic travel agents. It has also urged the government to restore the SEIS (Service Export Incentive Scheme) or an alternative scheme to boost the industry.

“The inbound tourism sector is still suffering and needs hand-holding... These steps (such as TCS) would place the tourism industry at par with foreign tour operators and help them compete with the neighbouring countries,” IATO said in the letter.

The Union Budget for FY24 proposed to raise the TCS on foreign tour packages to 20 percent from 5 percent from July 1.

""The TCS hike is causing loss to outbound tour operators based in India. A traveller would simply bypass the Indian operator and book outside, it will be a lose-lose situation both for the government and for tour operators,"" IATO President Rajiv Mehra said.

“The inbound tourism industry was the worst affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Post revival of international flight operations and tourist visa, only 30-40 percent of Inbound tourism to India has been revived. So, either SEIS should be restored or an alternative scheme benefiting the tourism sector should be announced,” the letter said.

The sector is undergoing stress with the SEIS scheme coming to an end and no alternative benefit given to the sector, Mehra said.

“GST is as high as 20-23 percent without any input tax credit, whereas neighbouring countries are charging 6-8 percent. To attract tourists, we need to holistically look at all these issues. As regards the argument of revenue loss, it would be made up more than 100 times as it has a positive multiplier impact on the overall economy,” he said.",336,-0.8095653553803762

Standard Life International DAC (SLIDAC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the UK-based insurer Phoenix Group, has signed up Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for transforming its operating model and enhancing the customer experience focussed on Germany and Austria.

The new project comes four months after the IT services major won a $723-million deal from the Phoenix Group, which is the UK's largest long-term savings and retirements provider.

While TCS did not disclose the deal size, sources said, this will be a big-ticket contract for the company and also marks its entry in the insurance space in Continental Europe.

TCS had earlier digitally transformed the operating model of another Phoenix Group UK subsidiary, Diligenta, in which it administers more than 10 million policies.

""The two organisations are keen to replicate this successful model, extending the same enhanced digital experience to policyholders in Germany and Austria, and thereafter in other European markets,"" TCS said.

With this partnership with SLIDAC, TCS will set up a customer operations centre in Germany, and ""a future-ready life and pensions digital platform for Germany and Austria, with capabilities to extend into other European markets"".

TCS will initially transform and migrate more than 400,000 policies comprising SLIDAC’s German and Austrian life and pension books to its platform, and create comprehensive, omnichannel, journey-based digital experiences for policyholders and advisors.

The IT firm will enable SLIDAC to launch innovative products more quickly, improve risk management and controls, and strengthen regulatory compliance, the company said.

The initiative is also aimed at helping SLIDAC and Phoenix Group to quickly respond to changes in its European markets and seize new opportunities for growth.

IT major Tata Consultancy Service (TCS) has refuted any “fraud” in its recruitment process and said that after intervisitation, “no key managerial person has been found involved”, though the company admitted there indeed has been a complaint regarding a scam in the recruitment process of contract resources.

A report by Mint said that a “whistleblower has alleged that ES Chakravarthy, the global head of TCS’s resource management group (RMG), the company’s recruitment division, had been accepting commissions from staffing firms for years” and subsequently sent Chakravarthy to leave and fired four executives the division, and also blacklisted three staffing firms. Citing an executive of the company, the report also said the “scandal” may have involved Rs 100 crore.

However, TCS in a statement said that its recruitment activities are not handled by the RMG.

“RMG is responsible for allocation of available resources to various projects and in case of any shortfall, fill such requirements through contractors. The complaint referred to in the article relates to the hiring of such contract resources employed by the contractors,” it said.

After the 6 lakh employee-strong company received a complaint, it said it launched a review to examine the allegations and found that this “does not involve any fraud by or against the company and no financial impact; the issue relates to breach of Company’s Code of Conduct by certain employees and vendors providing contractors, and no key managerial person of the Company has been found to be involved”.

IT services major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has blacklisted three staffing firms who were allegedly involved in bribing senior executives overseeing recruitment processes in the company to get business, sources in the know told Moneycontrol.

The sources cited above said the financial impact arising out of these violations is likely to be minimal, adding that this happened in the resource management group (RMG), which is different from its main talent acquisition group, that oversees the hiring function. People familiar with the company's inner workings say the RMG division brings in less than 1 percent of its workforce.

TCS confirmed the same in its exchange filings later saying, ""The recruitment activities in TCS are not handled by the Resource Management Group (RMG) as alleged, therefore the reference to alleged scam in recruitment process is incorrect.""

The company added, ""RMG is responsible for allocation of available resources to various projects and incase of any shortfall, fill such requirements through contractors.""

TCS' statements were in reference to an article published earlier in Mint, sharing details of senior executives in the RMG getting sacked for taking bribes.

According to the report, TCS sacked four senior executives from the RMG division following an internal investigation after a whistle blower alerted CEO K Krithivasan and COO Natarajan Ganapathy Subramaniam.

While E.S. Chakravarthy, the global head of RMG was sent on leave, one of the four other employees sacked included Arun GK who was heading one of the functions in the team, for taking commission from these HR firms, Mint said.

Sharing the findings of the internal investigation, TCS said that the issue relates to ""breach of Company’s Code of Conduct by certain employees and vendors providing contractors; and no key managerial person of the Company has been found to be involved.""

On those grounds the allegations does not involve ""any fraud by or against the Company and (has) no financial impact,"" it added.

Sources told Moneycontrol, that these irregularities cited were US-centric, wherein TCS invested nearly a billion dollars to hire employees. All the three hiring firms are based in India and have offices in the US.

“Each of these US staffing partners make an average 25 percent margin on each hiring contract. This is actually a very rampant trend in the overall IT sector where the staffing companies end up paying one percent in commission to the procurement guys in the client company,” one of the sources cited above said, seeking anonymity.

“Around 80 percent of the subcontracting costs for the IT companies are coming from the US region,” the source added.

Another source said that the investigation was in fact going on for nearly four months.

According to the Mint report, the RMG division has an estimated headcount of 3,000 and places around 1,400 engineers including new hires on projects. TCS ended FY23 with 614,795 employees and $27.93 billion in revenue.

The news comes over a week after the TCS reported that a $2-billion deal for a period of 10-year was cancelled by the US-based Transamerica Life Insurance, citing macro environment challenges and changing business priorities. TCS got the deal in 2018 and the pending work will be wrapped up in the next two and a half years.

In its other major market, the United Kingdom, TCS bagged four mega deals in the first half of 2023. These include the $1.1 billion Nest deal, the $723-million deal from insurer Phoenix Group, the Marks & Spencer deal and the 10-year contract with the Teacher’s Pension Scheme in England and Wales.

Amid a slew of reports observing a muted quarter for IT stocks, Morgan Stanley on Thursday took a cautious stance on Tier-1 and Tier-2 Indian tech majors. The US-based broking firm has downgraded Cyient to equal-weight and also warned of Tech Mahindra, TCS and Mphasis being exposed to greater risks.

The share price of Cyient Ltd, which rallied over 80 percent on the NSE in the past six months, is capped at Rs 1,500 by the broking firm.

It is important to note that JP Morgan too in its recent report on the IT Services industry had placed TCS and Mphasis on the negative catalyst watchlist. However, while JP Morgan expects every IT firm to disappoint the Street in the 2HY24, Morgan Stanley has given mixed signals by stating that it continues to maintain preference for large-cap IT companies such as Infosys, HCLTech and LTIMindtree.

The broking firm, in support of its selective stance, while assessing risk vulnerability of the large cap ITs, has cited ‘relative valuation support’ or a strong order book, which is supposed to make up for the moderated growth forecast.

For instance, according to SBI Securities, the numbers for HCL Tech in FY23 were ahead of the Street estimates as it reported a 9 percent on-year rise in its operational revenue. On the other hand, Tech Mahindra, which the broking firm sees exposed to greater risk, had reported a 7 percent decline in the operational revenue along with a reduced PAT of Rs 1,125 crore in FY23 against Rs 1,545 crore reported in FY22.

Morgan Stanley sees a potential for a cyclical pick-up in the IT sector only in the second half of either FY24 or FY25.

IT services giant Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) announced the expansion of its partnership with National Employment Savings Trust, UK’s largest workplace pension scheme in a £840 million (around $1.1 billion) deal over an initial tenure of 10 years, wherein it will digitally transform the firm’s administration services to deliver enhanced member experiences.

The total maximum estimated value of the contract, if extended to the entirety of its 18-year tenure, will be £1.5 billion (around $1.9 billion).

""The contract will be for a minimum term of 10 years, with an optional extension period of up to 5 years, and the option of an additional period of up to 3 years for exit. The total contract value is indicative and covers this potential 18 year period,"" a Nest spokesperson said.

This contract was earlier with French IT services firm Atos which was cancelled in early 2023, just two years into a potential 18-year team, The Register had reported.

The news website had added that the collapse of this contract may lead as many as 1,000 Atos job losses in the UK and India.

This is TCS’ fourth large deal from the region in 2023, following the $723-million deal from insurer Phoenix Group, the Marks & Spencer deal and the 10-year contract with the Teacher’s Pension Scheme in England and Wales, amidst a challenging macro environment in the region.

Nest and TCS have worked closely since 2011 when the digital, auto-enrolment pension scheme was first launched. Nest currently has more than 12 million members and by the end of the next decade it expects

to have around £100bn assets under management.

""While the exact costs are commercially sensitive, we can confirm that under our current estimates, the total contract cost falls within the total estimated contract value of £1.5bn, as published in the Contract Award Notice. It’s important to note this amount is the estimated total maximum value for the maximum duration of the contract, including extensions,"" the Nest spokesperson added.

As a part of this extended partnership, TCS will deploy solutions from TCS BaNCS to deliver personalized, self-directed experiences to members. “This will enable Nest’s 12 million members and 1 million employers to access the right information at the right time, in the way that suits them best,” the company said.

Gavin Perera-Betts, Chief Customer Officer, Nest in a statement said, “We have a strong foundation after many years of working together and they’ve proven their ability to deliver successfully for a scheme the size and complexity of Nest. This puts us in an excellent position to further advance our operations and build a truly digital offering that delivers a superior customer experience long into the future.”

Vivekanand Ramgopal, President of BFSI Products & Platforms, TCS added, “We are delighted to further expand this long-standing partnership with Nest and support them in pushing the boundaries in offering compelling omnichannel member experiences to the new generation of workers entering the workplace. We are looking forward to leveraging our contextual knowledge, technology expertise and proven platform to help Nest realise our shared vision for the future.”

TCS is the largest provider of software and IT services in the UK, and has a workforce spanning 30 locations around the country.

Overall, with this TCS would have bagged around five large deals in the first half of calendar year 2023 so far. The Marks & Spencer deal, according to reports is worth $1 billion.

The IT segment’s performance in Q4 disappointed many on Dalal Street with several frontline tech companies reporting muted growth. However, considering a strong order book along with the enhanced business opportunities the artificial intelligence (AI) wave brings, companies will continue to perform well, Marcellus Investment Managers founder and CIO Saurabh Mukherjea has said.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, Mukherjea shared his insights on the performance of Indian IT companies and their prospects. Calling the negative stance of analysts on IT akin to an attempt to time steam engines in the midst of the industrial revolution, Mukherjea said, “We are in the middle of a tech revolution. If someone is trying to time IT stocks, you are welcome to try but I am not going to do that.”

Here are some of the factors Mukherjea said will play in favour of the IT industry in the long run:

Strong order books

Although analysts were underwhelmed by the performance of Tier-I stocks, with Infosys deeply disappointing markets, Mukherjea laid out the narrative and numbers posted by TCS as an affirmation of the strength and buoyancy in the business. Marcellus continues to hold TCS in its portfolios, said Mukherjea, noting there is no sign of a slowdown.

“The deal wins of these companies continue to punch through record highs each year, including the last three months. We must note that in spite of the slowdown in the US, TCS announced a record deal,” he said.

In Q4FY23, TCS reported a flat EBIT margin of 24.5 percent, but the order book remained strong with a TCV win of$10 billion, up 28.2% QoQ.

Migration to the cloud

Referring to a finding by global IT major Accenture, Mukherjea pointed out that nearly 70 percent of the Fortune 500 companies are yet to switch to the cloud, which posed a significant growth opportunity.

Migration to the cloud for seamless data accessibility is a prerequisite for enhanced AI usage in tech businesses. “You cannot benefit from Generative AI as a corporation if you don’t move your kit to the cloud.”

According to Mukherjea, this prerequisite can play to the benefit of Indian IT firms which can enable this migration as and when the US-based companies increase their spending on IT.

While speculating further on how tech firms will perform, Mukherjea cited market intelligence and data services provider International Data Corporation's (IDC) forecast, which has raised its outlook for the Asia/Pacific region and the United States.

Contrary to major brokerages, IDC expects global IT and business services revenue to grow 5.7 percent year-on-year (YoY) in FY24. Stating that it wasn’t merely quarterly results but such larger metrics that he bases his decisions upon, Mukherjea said, “I fail to see where the slowdown is. So, at a time when people merely jump up and down over Q4 results ignoring other positives, it is a great opportunity for sensible investors to make money.”

The time is right for the US-India trade to grow exponentially as the business environment between the countries is improving and India's growth story is attracting a large number of American companies, according to the North America head of Tata Consultancy Services.

""I have not seen a better business-friendly climate from both governments and there is an increasing interest from US companies to deal with India, especially in areas of technology,"" Suresh Muthuswami, chairman of North America TCS told PTI in an interview.

India-US bilateral trade has been on the rise since 2000, but from 2020 to 2022, it has grown from USD 120 billion to USD 191 billion.

""I think we're just scratching the surface. (There is) enormous interest from the US government. India is a growing economy and(there is) a lot of interest to do business with India. So, the time is right for trade between the two countries to grow exponentially. When it comes to the United States technology has always led the way and it will, it will continue,"" Muthuswami said.

TCS which has been in the US for more than 50 years has been the growth and transformation partner for America's most valuable companies. TCS has more than 1,000 clients in the US.

""We have a lot of room to grow,"" he said, noting that every company increases their spending on technology, they all want to be technology companies, irrespective of the industries they are in.

Responding to a question, Muthuswami said there is a need for sharing technology, advanced technology skills and sharing best practices for upskilling.

His comments have come ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to the United States from June 20 to 23. The prime minister will meet US President Joe Biden and address a joint sitting of the US Congress during his US visit.

""We hope that Prime Minister Modi and President Biden discuss the importance of elevating technology partnership, strengthening our innovation ecosystems, that includes not only businesses but also governments and economic institutions,"" he said.

The TCS North America head said the collaboration between the US and India, on game-changing technologies such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence, 5G, Internet of Things is very critical for both countries.

""In my discussions with various government officials, it is abundantly clear that that's an area where both countries want to partner,"" he said.

""Another area is cybersecurity. TCS also has been working with White House initiatives on this. Cybersecurity is an area where there is a lot of focus for collaboration,"" he said.

The recently launched ICET Dialogue, he said, is a step in the right direction. ""We are very excited about its potential to deepen the ties between the US and India,"" he said adding that both governments can facilitate collaboration.

Noting that the pace of technological advancements is changing rapidly, he said the public-private sector, in both countries, must be positioned to respond with unity.

""To remain competitive, innovative American companies need well-trained employees. We have more than 45,000 people in our workforce in the US. We have been investing in innovation in the US,"" he said.

In June 2019, TCS launched Pace Port New York on the campus of Cornell Tech in New York City. Pace Port New York is located in the Tata Innovation Center, a building on the Cornell Tech campus that was funded with a USD 50 million TCS investment in the university.

The goal of the Tata Innovation Center is to bring academia and industry together under one roof to share ideas and research on next-generation digital technologies and how to commercialize new areas of collaboration.

In April 2022, TCS opened Pace Port Pittsburgh on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University. Pace Port Pittsburgh is located in TCS Hall, a building funded with a USD 35 million philanthropic gift to CMU.

The 90,000-square-foot building also houses the CMU Master of Science in Computational Finance program, facilities for the School of Computer Science's Institute for Software Research, and its Center for Business Engagement.

In March 2021, TCS announced plans to expand its operations in Ohio by hiring more than 800 local employees at its Seven Hills Park campus. To meet the increasing demand for IT talent and address local community needs, TCS will invest more than USD 518 million in Ohio over the next two years and expects to double participation in its STEM and computer science K-12 education programs by 2022.

Also in December 2020, TCS announced it would expand its business operations in Austin, Texas with the construction of a new facility, doubling its presence to more than 400 professionals in the city and adding to its 5,500-plus employees across the state.

By 2022, TCS will hire an additional 130 new employees in Austin. Over the next seven years, TCS will invest more than USD100 million in Austin.

In July 2021, TCS announced plans to expand its operations in Phoenix, Arizona, investing more than USD300 million by 2026 and hiring more than 220 employees by 2023, to meet the digital transformation needs of its customers.

In February 2022, TCS announced it was expanding its operations in New Jersey by hiring nearly 1,000 additional employees by the end of 2023 to meet the growing needs of customers to digitally transform their businesses.

Responding to a question, Muthuswami said TCS has hired about 21,000 people in the last three years in the US. ""We have hired 4,500 people from universities in the last three years in the US. Our talent acquisition strategy has been around these efforts right now. We will continue to double down on our investments in the US and hiring more people in the US.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has ended its $2 billion deal with the American arm of Dutch insurer Aegon NV's subsidiary Transamerica Life Insurance Co. The 10-year deal, signed in January 2018, has come to an end as Transamerica plans to cut its dependence on third-party IT services firms such as TCS, an executive familiar with the development told Mint. “TCS will have worked for about 80% of the duration of the contract, and the financial impact should be minimal,"" the executive said.

The IT major worked for Transamerica life insurance, annuities, and supplemental health insurance and other employee benefit products.

While TCS called this a multi-year deal, a Mint report said that TCS would have worked for eight out of the ten years of the contract, including the period of transition. The report further states that Transamerica is expected to focus on insourcing.

“Considering the current macro environment and respective business priorities, Transamerica and TCS have mutually agreed to end the administration arrangement for Transamerica life insurance, annuities and supplemental health insurance, and other employee benefit products,"" spokespeople for TCS and Transamerica told Mint in an identical response.

“Transamerica and TCS will work together to ensure a smooth transition of the administration of these products to a new servicing model, which we expect to take approximately 30 months.""

This development comes at a time when TCS is staring at a slowdown. This makes it a challenging start for chief executive K. Krithivasan, who only took over as the boss on June 1 after his predecessor Rajesh Gopinathan resigned. At the time it was signed in January 2018, this was the largest deal TCS had bagged.

On Wednesday, JP Morgan said that it expects most IT services firms to miss current expectations and place Infosys, TCS and Mphasis on negative catalyst watch.

The foreign brokerage firm has reiterated its negative view across the IT Services universe, and expects every technology services firm to disappoint street expectations in 1Q and current second half of FY24 growth expectations.

Meanwhile, Motilal Oswal Financial Services noted that despite demonstrating strong resilience, TCS should anticipate the possibility of a moderate full-year revenue growth in FY24 if similar instances of delayed decision-making and cash conservation from clients reoccur.

Yet the domestic brokerage firm believes, considering TCS’s size, order book, and exposure to long duration orders and portfolio, the IT major is well positioned to withstand the weakening macro environment and ride on the anticipated industry growth.

The Nifty India Digital Index, introduced in January 2022, is finally showing signs of a shift towards bullish momentum, according to technical analysts.

The index, which was introduced by the National Stock Exchange to track India's digital theme, witnessed a sharp 30 percent correction within the first five months of its inception. It was dragged down by stocks like Zomato, Info Edge, Nykaa and tier-1 IT companies like TCS, HCL Tech and Infosys.

Zomato, Info Edge and Nykaa command 8.5 percent, 7.7 percent and 5.15 percent weightage in the index, respectively.

""Over time, the index has formed a base within the price range of 4,900 to 5,600. This consolidation phase signifies a period of stabilization and accumulation,"" Viraj Vyas, CMT, technical & derivatives analyst - institutional equity, at Ashika Stock Broking said.

In recent trading sessions, there have been attempts to break out above the upper threshold of the consolidation range.

""The index is hovering near the neckline and a weekly close above 5,750 will confirm a trigger of this pattern with targets around 6,400 and 7,000 thereafter,"" Gaurav Bissa, vice president, Incred Equities added.

Which stocks are driving the rally?

Heaviest weight Zomato, that has rallied over 45 percent in the past two month, has propelled the index higher. Shares of Zomato hit a fresh one-year high on Rs 80 on June 12.

The stock was recently added to Jefferies' India long-only as well its Global long-only portfolios. The global brokerage has set a target price of Rs 100 on the stock and expects the platform's delivery revenue to grow at a 25 percent CAGR over FY22-26.

On May 31, the stock's weight in MSCI index was increased which has also boosted sentiment among investors. According to Nuvama Institutional Equities' calculations, the weight addition triggered inflows of $59 million into the stock.

Another stock that has propelled the index higher is One97 Communications, the parent of Paytm. The stock is up over 93 percent from its record low. A recent trigger for the stock has been RBI's approval for First Loss Default Guarantee (FLDG) programme.

The FLDG is a popular product that fintechs in the country use to form partnerships with banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).

According to analysts, the risk-reward is turning more positive for Paytm due to strong revenue momentum, possible upside in operational leverage and limited competition.

""We see Paytm's margins improving on back of revenue mix shiſt towards high margin Soundbox & lending revenues. We estimate adj EBITDA margins to improve from -2 percent in FY23 to 8 percent by FY26,"" according to Bank of America.

Another index constituent Tata Communications has rallied over 30 percent in the past one month and contributed to the upmove in the index. The company aims to double its data revenue to Rs 28,000 crore by FY27, growing at 19 percent a year.

The company aims to achieve the target by strengthening leadership in India, growing wallet share through enhanced customer relevance and increasing international market share, it said during an analysts' meet.

JP Morgan reiterated its negative stance on the Information Technology (IT) sector on June 14, emphasising that every company will disappoint Street expectation in Q1 this fiscal, as also in the second half of FY24. The brokerage has placed IT majors like Infosys, TCS and Mphasis on a negative catalyst watch.

The sectoral index, which has been on a downward trend since June 1, was down less than once per cent at 28,828.65. At 2.20 pm, while Infosys and Mphasis were down by a percent, TCS managed to remain marginally in green.

Several analysts in the recent past have highlighted that the sector was vulnerable to global headwinds. In the recent March quarter show, performance of the IT companies did not meet the Street expectations.

The performance of Tier-1 technology firms in the March quarter was muted with the revenue growth ranging between -3.2 and 0.6 percent, pointed out domestic brokerage firm Sharekhan. For instance, the Bengaluru-based Infosys’ revenue declined by over 2 percent QoQ. Moreover, it has now set a single digit growth guidance in the range of 4-7 percent for FY24.

“The delayed spending in a few segments, concerns in BFSI, and fears over a global economic slowdown are impacting the overall performance of the sector. On the valuation front, over the past 1.5 years, the industry valuations have been corrected by more than a third,” said Vinod TP, Research analyst at Geojit Financial Services.

Tata Consultancy Service (TCS), India’s largest IT firm, has denied reports that its women employees are resigning en masse after it ended its work-from-home (WFH) policy.

Women constitute over 35 per cent of the IT giant's 6.14 lakh-plus workforce. According to the 2022 Burgundy Private Hurun India 500 report, TCS is the largest employer of women in India in the private sector.

In a question-and-answer session, excerpts of which was published in the company’s annual report last week, Milind Lakkad, chief human resources officer at TCS, was asked about the higher attrition among women staff as compared to men in FY 2023.

While the company did not specify the exact number of women who have resigned in the past year, the top executive termed the trend as “unusual” and suggested that the return-to-office policy could have been a factor for the higher number of resignations by women in the last financial year.

“Historically, women’s attrition at TCS has been similar or lower than men’s attrition, so this is unusual. There might be other reasons but intuitively, I would think working from home during the pandemic reset the domestic arrangements for some women, keeping them from returning to office even after everything normalised,” Lakkad said.

“The higher attrition among women in FY 2023 is a setback to our efforts to promote gender diversity but we are doubling down on it. Focused leadership development programs like iExcel are driving tremendous change.”

Women made up 23 per cent of all the leadership positions fulfilled internally, he said.

In FY23, TCS had 2.19 lakh permanent women employees, comprising 35.8 per cent of the workforce. Overall, the turnover rate among female permanent employees stood at 21.9 per cent, while it was at 20.9 per cent for men.

On reports of women employees resigning en masse due to the return-to-office policy, sources at TCS told Moneycontrol, “We deny it.”

TCS introduced the return-to-office policy last September, asking employees to work in the office for at least three days a week. It had stirred the hornet’s nest after it said that adhering to the roster would be mandatory and be tracked.

In an internal mail sent to employees, company had said, “Senior leaders of TCS have been working from TCS offices for a while now and our customers are also visiting TCS offices… Your respective managers will now roster you to work from the TCS office for at least 3 days in a week,” the company said in the mail. “Adherence to rostering is mandatory and will be tracked… any noncompliance will be taken seriously, and administrative measures may be applied.”

According to a report in the Times of India last month, the company has also started sending out memos to employees who are not present in office at least 12 days a month.

TCS hired 22,600 people on a net basis in FY23, and reported an attrition rate of 20.1 per cent on a last-twelve-month basis in IT services.

TCS witnessed a major leadership change as Rajesh Gopinathan was succeeded by K Krithivasan, who took over as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in the beginning of June. During Gopinathan's stint, TCS became India's second most valuable company, crossing $168 billion in market cap in FY23. Its revenue and client base also grew.

Lakkad said the CEO-level attrition was an ""unprecedented event at TCS"".",563,0.3668721516927083

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCS

The analysis of TCS AR23 not only highlights the widespread adoption of digital technologies in customer-facing operations, but also the increasing penetration of AI and automation in middle and back-office operations. With the growing intensity of adverse macro-economic environment in the latter half of the year, the clients are reprioritizing their spends and expressing interest in transforming their operating model. Apart from demand for driving operational efficiency and optimizing costs, Cloud transformation remained a high priority area for enterprises in FY23. Despite demonstrating strong resilience, TCS anticipates the possibility of a moderate full-year revenue growth in FY24 if similar instances of delayed decision-making and cash conservation from clients reoccur.



Outlook

We maintain our positive stance on TCS. Our TP of INR 3,860 implies 25x FY25E EPS, with a 20% upside potential. We reiterate our BUY rating.

#1. BSNL to get Rs 89,000 crore revival package to deploy 4G/5G services

The cabinet committee on economic affairs has approved cleared a Rs 89,047 crore revival package for Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, the third handout for the state-run telco since 2019. BSNL will use the money to acquire spectrum to offer 4G services within months and 5G services by 2024 across the country. The total government assistance to India’s fourth largest carrier has now totals to Rs 3.22 lakh crore.

Why it’s important: Although revenues have improved in 2022-23, BSNL continues to lose market share to rivals and its net and cash losses keep widening. It remains to be seen whether the latest fund infusion can script a turnaround for the ailing state-run telecom operator.

#2. OECD raises India’s growth forecast marginally to 6 percent in 2023-24

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has upped its forecast on India’s economic expansion for 2023-24 to 6 percent, marginally higher 5.9 percent predicted earlier. The club of rich nations expects retail inflation to be 4.8 percent in the current financial year, one percentage point below its previous projection and slower than Reserve Bank of India’s forecast of 5.2 percent.

Why it’s important: The OECD’s prediction cites weak global demand and the effect of monetary policy tightening as the main factors constraining economic growth in the country.

#3. Regulator seeks to trace money flowing into venture capital, private equity funds

India’s stock market regulator, which is set to change rules to trace persons controlling foreign portfolio investors, will also track the money flowing into local private equity and venture capital funds. The Securities and Exchange Board of India wants to know who the investors are, where the money is coming from, and whether the alternative investment funds are being misused.

Why it’s important: There have been concerns that alternative investment funds may have been used to sidestep restrictions on foreign direct investment or used by a local promoter to indirectly hold a stake in a company. The regulator wants to put an end to these practices.

#4. A third of Rs 2,000 banknotes deposited or exchanged so far since May 23

The withdrawal of Rs 2,000 currency notes, which started on May 23, has gathered pace with around 35 percent of them being either deposited or exchanged. There were 1.81 billion pieces of Rs 2,000 notes in circulation on March 31, about 1.3 percent of the total circulation in volume terms. Gujarat, Punjab, and New Delhi saw the most return of the Rs 2,000 denomination. Around 80 percent of the notes returned have been deposited and the rest exchanged.

Why it’s important: There has been no long queues and panicking customers since banks started exchanging the high-value banknotes. It has been far less disruptive than the 2016 demonetization exercise since a lower value of notes are being withdrawn over a much longer period of time.

#5. Dreamliner and Airbus A330 compete for wide body aircraft order of IndiGo

The race for IndiGo’s wide-body aircraft order has narrowed to two finalists, the Boeing B787 Dreamliner, and the Airbus A330. India’s largest airline, which has over 500 narrow-body aircraft in the pipeline, is in talks with Boeing and Airbus for around 20 wide-body aircraft as it seeks to expand its international operations

Why it’s important: IndiGo is preparing to aggressively expand its international operations with the acquisition of long-haul, wide-body aircraft.

#6. Sequoia Capital and spun-off unit Peak XV may compete in India to fund start-ups

Days after Silicon Valley investor Sequoia Capital spun of its India and Southeast Asia entity and rebranded it as Peak XV, managing partner Shailendra Singh said that there will be no portfolio conflict. Peak XV will not compete with Sequoia in a big way but there could be an overlap in 5 to 10 percent of cases, Singh said. There is no non-compete signed and Peak XV is free to go open a US office and Sequoia is free to open an India office, Singh said.

Why it’s important: Sequoia is retreating from Asia when several start-ups in its India portfolio have been facing difficulties. Only time will show how Peak XV performs after the separation with its marquee parent.

#7. Delays in getting visas for Chinese professional starts hurting several India businesses

The central government’s strict scrutiny before granting visas to Chinese nationals and clearing investment plans of Chinese firms is impacting Indian businesses, with projects getting delayed or even scrapped. Expansion projects of local electronics contract manufacturers, including Dixon Technologies proposed Rs 400 crore unit for manufacturing refrigerators, are impacted due to non-grant or delay in grant of visa to Chinese engineers. There are some other instances as well.

Why it’s important: Bilateral relations between India and China have hit an all-time low since the two-year old border faceoff. It is a given that businesses will face the heat of strained political relations.

#8. Top TCS executives saw salary hikes in 2022-23 when other IT brass saw earnings contraction

At a time when salaries of the top management of India’s two largest IT services have seen erosion, the leadership at Tata Consultancy Services has bucked the trend. Rajesh Gopinathan, who stepped down as CEO and managing director, saw his remuneration go up 13.17 percent in 2022-23 to Rs 29.16 crore. N Ganapathy Subramaniam, chief operating officer, saw his total pay rise 14 percent to Rs 20.68 crore.

Why it’s important: The pay hikes at TCS came at a time when top executives in other software firms have seen an erosion in earning, driven primarily by poor demand in key markets in the West, particularly in discretionary spending.

#9. Maximum airfares have dropped 14-61 percent after government intervention, minister says

Maximum airfares on busy routes from Delhi have dropped between 14 and 61 per cent in the past two days, aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has said. It had instructed airlines in a meeting on June 5 to keep fares reasonable. The government is not considering regulating fares like it did during the pandemic, the minister said. It was for airlines to proactively monitor fares as part of their social objective and not wait for the government to point out abnormalities, the minister said.

Why it’s important: After Go First filed for insolvency and halted operations, other airline firms raised fares in sectors where budget carrier operated flights. A nudge from the government could moderate the opportunistic hikes to an extent.

#10. No regulations desirable for small firms in AI space, ChatGPT chief Sam Altman says

Major companies operating in the AI space, including OpenAI, should be regulated but not smaller ones and startups, Sam Altman, founder, and CEO of OpenAI that developed ChatGPT, the chatbot that’s transforming search and threatens to upend the technological order, has said in an interview. There should be no regulations on smaller companies or on open-source models because it’s important to let that flourish, he said. Altman has called for regulation for big corporations.

Largest tech company TCS on Tuesday said attrition among its women employees has raced past the same for men, hinting that the end of work-from-home may have a role to play in it.

Its chief human resources officer Milind Lakkad said that historically, the attrition among women employees  who constitute over 35 per cent of the over 6 lakh-strong workforce  has been lower or similar to that of men, and called the development as ""unusual"".

""…I would think working from home during the pandemic reset the domestic arrangements for some women, keeping them from returning to office even after everything normalised,"" he said in an interview published in the company's annual report.

Lakkad acknowledged that the higher attrition among women is a ""setback"" to the Tata Group company's efforts to promote gender diversity and added that the company is focusing on reversing the trend.

The annual report did not reveal the exact attrition number on the basis of gender. Its overall attrition peaked in the middle of the fiscal gone by and came down to over 20 per cent at the end of March.

Lakkad said focused leadership development programmes like 'iExcel' are driving change on this front. The annual report said the flagship executive leadership development programme for women has completed 22 editions and 1,450 women leaders have benefitted from it.

Women made up nearly a fourth of the leadership positions fulfilled with internal candidates in FY23, even though they account for only 14 per cent of the applicant pool, Lakkad said.

""This speaks well of the quality of the women candidates in our leadership pool as well as the supportive attitudes of our business leaders in promoting diversity,"" he added.

Women constituted 38.1 per cent of TCS' net hires in FY23, Lakkad said.

'Rebegin' — a TCS initiative for experienced women professionals re-entering the workforce after a break — saw nearly 14,000 job applications in FY23, the annual report said.

Of the nearly 30,000 employees classified as senior management, almost 4,000 or over 13 per cent were women, the annual report said.

It also said that TCS has introduced a policy on flexible work arrangements, which provides necessary support and flexibility for caregivers of young children, expectant women employees, and persons with disability.

TCS, which has been pushing employees to resume working from offices lately to deepen the organisational culture, said that it does not discriminate between genders on remuneration.",405,0.09436844289302826

Rajesh Gopinathan, the former chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director of Tata Consultancy Service (TCS), earned Rs 29.16 crore in salary in the financial year 2022-23, a 13.17 per cent jump in his salary from the previous year. The numbers were revealed in the company’s annual report released on Wednesday.

However, the salary of the former top executive of TCS, India’s largest software company, in the last financial year was much lesser than his industry peers, the CEOs of tech giants Infosys and Wipro. While Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte drew a salary of Rs 82.4 crore in FY23 ($10 million), Infosys CEO Salil Parekh earned Rs 56.44 crore the same year.

Gopinathan’s compensation included his basic salary; benefits, perquisites and allowances; and commission. He received a commission of Rs 25 crore in FY23. The compensation does not include employee stock purchase scheme (ESPS). He holds around 2,760 stocks in TCS.

In the previous year (FY22), Gopinathan received a total compensation of Rs 25.75 crore.

He was the fifth highest-paid IT CEO in India in 2021-2022.

Rajesh Gopinathan was succeeded by K Krithivasan took over as TCS CEO on June 1. While Krithivasan’s compensation package was not disclosed, he will be paid a basic salary of Rs 10 lakh per month, which can go up to a maximum of Rs 16 lakh per month. Krithivasan, as of FY23, holds around 11,232 company shares. However, like in the case of Gopinathan, the commission is subject to the company’s performance and will make up a bulk of his remuneration.

Gopinathan’s compensation included his basic salary; benefits, perquisites and allowances; and commission. He received a commission of Rs 25 crore in FY23. The compensation does not include employee stock purchase scheme (ESPS). He holds around 2,760 stocks in the company.

K Krithivasan took over the top job from Gopinathan from June 1, 2023 onwards, although his compensation package was not disclosed. He will be paid a basic salary of Rs 10 lakh per month, which can go up to a maximum of Rs 16 lakh per month. Krithivasan, as of FY23, holds around 11,232 company shares. However, like in the case of Gopinathan, the commission is subject to the company’s performance and will make up a bulk of his remuneration.

The company said that the commission is calculated with reference to the net profit earned, subject to the ceilings set. The specific amount to be paid out to the executive, however, will be up to the Board or the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and paid out annually.

Gopinathan made over 427 times the median remuneration of the company’s employees. According to the report, TCS employees in FY23 saw a median remuneration increase of 5.11 percent. When calculated, TCS' median employee pay for FY23 stood at Rs. 6.82 lakh per annum. The company has around 6,14,795 permanent employees.

Chief Operating Officer NG Subramaniam earned Rs 23.6 crore in FY23, of which Rs 19.5 crore was the commission, and the rest being his salary and benefits. He saw a 14.08 percent increase in remuneration, and made 345.68 times the median remuneration. He holds 1,97,760 shares in the company.

There is a wide disparity between the salaries of CEOs in TCS’ peers such as Infosys and Wipro. For the year in question, Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte drew a salary of Rs 82.4 crore in FY23 ($10 million), which was a fall of 5 percent from the preceding year.

Infosys CEO Salil Parekh, on the other hand, earned Rs 56.44 crore in FY23, which was a fall from Rs 71 crore in FY22. However, the fall was primarily on account of exercising restricted stock units (RSUs) during the year. Parekh made 627 times the median remuneration, as compared to Gopinathan’s 427.

Focus on ‘AI transition’

In his letter to the shareholders, Chairman N Chandrasekaran highlighted that amid rapid evolution of digital technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) transition has become the company’s “central focus.”

“The impact of AI and Machine learning is going to be profound. There is a transition already underway from predictive AI to generative AI. Majority of the businesses are still adopting predictive AI and are on the journey of capturing large volume of data, harnessing the power of cloud and IoT. There are varying levels of adoption in companies across sectors,” he said.

“Leveraging generative AI would further require technology innovation and investments,” he added.

The company will also focus on building talent for the future. The energy, supply chain, and AI transitions will require companies to reskill/upskill existing talent base, hire and integrate new talent, and invest in research, according to Chandrasekaran. “Our technology strengths make us well-placed to respond to the global demand and scale up our talent base,” he said.

He also noted the ongoing energy transition as sustainable growth takes centre stage for businesses; and a supply chain transition resulting from geo-political situation is underway as companies rebalance their supply chains for resilience and efficiency.

Meanwhile, Krithivasan in his letter said, “As part of their continuing digital transformation journey, we see sustained focus on cloud adoption, data architecture, customer experience and business model transformation.”

“On top of these current focus areas, technologies like 5G, IoT, generative AI, virtual reality / metaverse, digital twin and others are also gaining attention and are likely to attract investments in the short to medium term,” he added.

Gopinathan’s last letter

Gopinathan’s last letter to the company’s shareholders as the TCS CEO and MD mentioned that having full services capability as a company has helped TCS’ enable clients to thrive in good times and bad.

“During the up-cycle, we help clients accelerate and expand their technology-led innovation to differentiate themselves and drive growth. On the down cycle, we help them adapt, using technology to drive the efficiency, agility and resilience needed to cope with a faltering economy, and prepare for better times ahead,” he said.

Gopinathan termed his tenure as an “absolute privilege and unparalleled learning experience”, and said that he is confidence the company’s best years are ahead of it as enterprises rely on technology ever more.",796,0.7180466800928116

Global transitions in the areas of energy, supply chains and artificial intelligence will require significant investments in technology and innovation and offer huge growth opportunities for IT companies, Tata Consultancy Services chairman N Chandrasekaran said.

Advancements have made AI transition a central focus, and the impact of AI and machine learning “will be very profound,” he said in a letter to shareholders.

Chandrasekaran said TCS is significantly investing in building AI capabilities, which include products and platforms that are AI-powered. According to TCS, technologies such as 5G, IoT, generative AI, and virtual reality/metaverse are also gaining attention and are likely to attract investments in the short to medium term.

""Majority of the businesses are still adopting predictive AI and are on the journey of capturing large volumes of data, harnessing the power of cloud and IoT,” he said. “Leveraging generative AI would further require technology innovation and investments.”

Predictive analytics refers to the analysis of data to forecast future events or trends. Generative AI are interfaces such as ChatGPT that can be used to create new content.

Supply chains, energy

The TCS chairman noted that the geopolitical situation is altering global supply chains and companies are rebalancing them for resilience and efficiency.

“New global supply chain ecosystems are being created with India playing an important role. This is being led by significant capital investments in technology to set-up ‘digital-first’ manufacturing and supply chain operations as well as to build ecosystem integration with partners,” he said.

On energy transition, he said there are many innovations across products, services, manufacturing, and delivery, and new business models are emerging.

“This requires investments in technology and innovation including electric mobility, renewable power, hydrogen and sustainable fuel,” he said. “Across the facets of this transition, investments in IT and digital technology will be an important enabler for businesses.”

TCS has thrived despite global uncertainty for IT companies over the past few months, Chandrasekaran said.

TCS has done well “in a volatile global environment in the year gone by,” he said in the letter to shareholders. In FY 2023, the company delivered revenue of Rs 225,458 crore, a growth of 17.6 percent.

“This growth has come at an industry-leading operating margin of 24.1 percent,” he said.

The company closed the year with an order book of $34.1 billion.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on June 5 announced that it has won a 10-year contract from the Department for Education (DfE) to administer and enhance customer experiences for the Teachers’ Pension Scheme in England and Wales. This will be the IT services major’s third large deal from the region following the $723-million deal from insurer Phoenix Group and the Marks & Spencer deal in 2023, despite macro-economic uncertainties.

The Teachers’ Pension Scheme is the second largest public sector pension scheme in the UK with over 2 million members. The size of the deal was not disclosed by the company, but according to sources, it's a large deal.

Through this contract, TCS will manage the scheme’s administration services using its digitally enabled, omnichannel platform powered by TCS BaNCS. TCS has been tasked with providing digital-first, self-service pension experience, “giving scheme employers and members any-time, any-channel access to their account information, along with personalized insights to help them understand their pension plan better and empower them to make informed decisions.”

As part of the partnership with DfE, TCS also plans to expand its already significant presence in the UK life and pensions industry by establishing a service hub in Darlington. TCS is the largest provider of software and IT services in the UK, and has a workforce spanning 30 locations around the country.

Vivekanand Ramgopal, President, BFSI Products & Platforms, TCS said, “We are delighted to partner with the Department for Education to digitally transform administration of the Teachers’ Pensions Scheme and deliver the best-administered UK public sector pensions scheme…Enhanced customer experience has been the cornerstone of our platform’s value proposition to clients in the UK pensions industry.”

He added, “ We will continue to strategically invest in our platform and pursue our aspiration to be the preferred growth and transformation partner to life and pensions companies in the UK.”

Overall, with this TCS would have bagged around four large deals in the first half of calendar year 2023 so far. The Marks & Spencer deal, according to reports is worth $1 billion.

The revenue department is working on widening the personal income tax base by plugging leakages and compliance gaps using data, a senior government official said.

“There is a tax gap and compliance gap in PIT i.e. personal income tax,” the official from revenue department told Moneycontrol. “In order to increase the tax base, the thrust is on gathering more information about individuals’ transactions, as a result of which evasion is prevented and more people file taxes.”

The total number of individual taxpayers in FY21 was at 6.33 crore against estimated working population of India at a total of 83.7 crore. The gross Personal Income Tax collection (including STT) in 2022-23 stood at Rs. 9,60,764 crore with a growth rate of 24.23% over Rs. 7,73,389 crore in FY22. Personal income tax as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product has gone up from 2.11 percent in the financial year 2014-15 to 2.94 percent in 2021-22.

The government is using Data Analytics, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to make the tax system more effective.

Data Analytics helps in sending reminders for advance tax payments, identifying mismatches in Income Tax Returns (ITRs) and transactions made by individuals, and spotting potential high-risk transactions. Data analytic techniques can also be used to focus campaigns on high-risk cases from a tax evasion perspective.

Using Artificial Intelligence, and linking data with banks and mutual funds, tax evasion can be prevented, an effort on which the department is focussing.

Using data, it has been found, for instance, that Indians’ spending on foreign travel has increased to pre-Covid levels, the official cited above said.

To plug this compliance gap, the government has hiked the Tax Collection at Source (TCS). A May 16 notification said foreign exchange spending on international credit cards will attract 20 percent TCS. It created a stir among Indians who holiday abroad frequently.

Effective July 1, 2023, the Indian government has raised the TCS rate on foreign remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) from 5 percent to 20 percent. On the purchase of overseas tour packages, currently, a TCS of 5 percent is levied. From July 1, 2023, this will be hiked to 20 percent. There is no threshold for sale on overseas tour program packages.

The May 16 notification on Foreign Exchange Management (Current Account Transactions) (Amendment) Rules, 2023, brought the spending in foreign exchange through international credit cards under the Reserve Bank of India's LRS, which permits Indian residents to send up to $250,000 in a financial year abroad, without prior approval from the central bank.

After the backlash, the government on May 19 said that payments by individuals of up to Rs 7 lakh per annum using their international cards will be exempted.

TCS gets deducted on certain expenses, with the tax authority intending to keep track of them. TCS refunds can be claimed only at the time of filing income tax returns.

Similar to the TCS decision, there have been a couple of other recent tax measures that have raised confusion and consternation among taxpayers.

Angel tax

Angel tax, which was introduced in 2012 to check money laundering, became a controversy after the government threw a curveball in Union Budget 2023 and brought non-resident foreign investors under its ambit. It mandated that a startup’s fundraising could be taxed whenever the funding round took place at a valuation more than the fair value of shares. Since as many as 90 startups had received foreign funding, the decision drew a huge backlash.

In the 2023 Budget, overseas investment in unlisted, closely held companies, except startups recognized by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, were brought under the angel tax net.

After the industry raised concerns, the finance ministry, provided some relief on May 24 when it notified classes of investors who would not come under the angel tax provision.

The notification excluded entities registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) as Category-I Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs), Endowment Funds, Pension Funds, sovereign wealth funds and broad-based pooled investment vehicles from the angel tax. Even other entities with direct or indirect government ownership of 75 percent or more will also be exempt from this, it said.

The ministry notified 21 countries, including the US, UK, France, Australia, Germany, Spain, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Israel, Italy, Iceland, Japan, Korea, Russia, Norway, New Zealand and Sweden, from where non-resident investment in unlisted Indian startups would not attract angel tax.

The list, however, excluded investment from countries like Singapore, the Netherlands and Mauritius, from where a majority of inbound FDI is channeled into India.

Corporate entities have been kept out of the list, making them potentially liable to angel tax.

Rule 11UA of the Income-tax Rules, 1962, prescribes valuation methods to determine the Fair Market Value (FMV) of assets, including shares of an unlisted company. For unlisted company shares, the FMV is determined based on the following two methods: the net asset value, as reflected in the audited balance sheet of the company; or the discounted cash flow value, as determined by a Category-I merchant banker.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) issued draft valuation rules on May 26 prescribing additional valuation methods proposing that if consideration is received by an Indian private company from a company resident in any of the 21 countries mentioned against issue of unquoted equity shares to such entity, the price of the equity shares corresponding to such consideration may be taken as the FMV of the equity shares for resident and non-resident investors subject to certain conditions. Further, a merchant banker’s valuation certificate — if it is of a date not more than 90 days prior to the date of issue of unquoted equity shares that are the subject matter of valuation — will be acceptable.

Higher STT on futures, options contracts

Union Budget 2023 said the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on sale of futures would be raised from 0.01 percent to 0.0125 percent and in case of options from 0.017 percent to 0.021 percent. The announcement created confusion as the STT on sale of options was already revised in 2016 to 0.05 percent from 0.017 percent.

After hours of confusion on the size of the STT hike on the sale of options, the finance ministry finally clarified that it will be hiked to Rs 6,250 on a turnover of Rs 1 crore.

STT is a turnover tax paid on the total given or received in sale of stocks, futures, options, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.",1112,0.06647696278311989

IT major Wipro has announced June 16 as the record date for the buyback of its shares worth Rs 12,000 crore. This will be Wipro’s fifth buyback in history. The buyback has been approved for a minimum price of Rs 445 a share, which is roughly 10 percent higher than its current price of Rs 405. The size of the buyback offer is 4.91 percent of the total equity shares, which is good enough to get a decent acceptance ratio in the retail category.

Let’s look at what happened in the previous 4 buybacks that were announced by Wipro in the year 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020.

The below graphic illustrates the stock’s return from the date of announcement of buyback to the record date. It’s clearly visible that the stock corrected quite a bit on 3 of the 4 occasions, and closed 1.7 percent higher during 2019.

Previous Wipro Buybacks

The average loss during the period from the date of announcement of buyback to the record date is 4.8 percent. The buyback announcement came along with the earnings declaration for Q4 FY 2022-23. It posted a revenue decline of 0.6 percent in the constant currency terms, which was below the street estimates. The company is expecting sluggishness in the near future and cut down on its growth guidance by 1-3 percent.

If we look at the couple of recent buybacks offered by other IT companies, two names come to my mind - TCS and Birlasoft. TCS announced its buyback when the stock was trading at Rs 3,900 and offered to buy it at Rs 4,500, which was 15 percent higher from market price at that point. But since the buyback announcement, TCS only corrected. It made a high of a little over Rs 4,000 a piece post the buyback announcement and currently trades at Rs 3,299.

Similarly, Birlasoft announced its buyback on May 23, 2022 when the stock was trading at Rs 378. The buyback price was set at Rs 500 a share which was 32 percent higher than its market price at that time. The stock never closed above Rs 380 on a daily basis since that buyback announcement till date. The stock touched Rs 250 on the downside and currently trades at Rs 350 a piece.

Those who are holding the shares in their portfolio for a long term perspective can tender it in the buyback and based on the acceptance ratio can buy the accepted shares back. For example, if you hold 500 shares, you can tender them all and let’s say acceptance ratio comes in at 8 percent in which case 40 shares will be accepted at 445 a piece, and you will be left with 460 shares.

The remaining 40 shares can again be bought from the open market which is likely to be much less than the buyback price. However, should you buy now from the open market to tender it in the buyback programme, I will not advise my readers on that. I have presented some data for my readers to make an informed decision.

The rule to impose 20 per cent Tax Collected at Source (TCS) on foreign spending has a loophole when it comes to booking foreign holidays.

According to changes brought about in the Finance Act 2023, buying an overseas tour package from an Indian tour operator will attract 20 percent TCS from July 1. Currently, the rate of TCS is 5 percent. But it’s not clear whether this TCS will apply to holiday packages booked with foreign tour operators or online travel agencies that are headquartered outside India. Moneycontrol had asked the Ministry of Finance questions on TCS and was asked to wait for further clarifications. TCS on overseas tour packages came under the spotlight recently after the government brought international spending via credit cards when travelling abroad under the RBIs’ Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), and hence, under the TCS.

Also, if you make international flight and hotel bookings yourself, then TCS won’t apply until you cross the Rs 7 lakh threshold set for debit and credit cards. This is for bookings made in foreign currency, not in INR. In the latter case, no TCS applies.

Currently, if you book an overseas tour package – whether with local tour operators such as Veena World and Kesari Tours or online travel aggregators (OTAs) such as MakeMy Trip, EaseMyTrip and the like – you pay 5 percent TCS.

From July 1, 2023, 20 percent TCS will apply on such foreign holiday packages. This becomes applicable from the very first spend – there is no minimum threshold for TCS exemption on overseas tour packages.

But will this 20 percent TCS impact overseas tour packages that are booked with international tour operators (Cosmos, Globus, Scanam Tours, Intrepid Travel etc.)? Not necessarily.

That apart, there’s one other way of holidaying abroad without having to pay TCS up to an extent – by making your own foreign hotel and flight bookings. In this case, TCS will apply only on spends exceeding Rs 7 lakh a year if the bookings are made in foreign currency. If you pay in INR, no TCS will apply.

Holiday booking with a foreign tour operator

Rajiv Mehra, President, Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO), highlights a possible loophole in the applicability of TCS. According to him, if you book an overseas holiday package with a tour operator based outside India, then this 20 percent TCS won’t apply. “You can pay a foreign tour operator using your credit card. Unless you cross the Rs 7 lakh limit for credit cards, TCS will not apply,” explains Mehra. He says that IATO has made a representation to the Finance Ministry pointing to the need for a level-playing field between domestic and foreign tour operators.

According to Sandeep Jhunjhunwala, Partner, Nangia Andersen LLP, an anomaly exists with respect to the obligation of TCS collection on overseas tour packages by foreign travel booking e-commerce platforms as they are non-residents in India based on their tax residency status. However, as the use of credit cards beyond Rs 7 lakh comes under the TCS ambit, even customers accessing foreign tour operators would ultimately end up paying 20 percent TCS on such transactions. Russell Gaitonde, Partner, Deloitte India, however, has a somewhat different view. He says, “I believe, TCS ought to apply in this situation (booking via an overseas tour operator). Although operationalising this process and complying with this requirement might prove to be a challenge for overseas tour operators, especially when they deal with Indian resident customers.”

But TCS or no TCS, many holiday travellers may still prefer to go with an Indian tour operator, even when booking for foreign holidays. The possibility of having to follow up with a tour operator in a foreign country in case of any disputes may deter some from taking this route.

Do-it-yourself traveller

Forget foreign tour packages – if you are the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) traveller who likes to book hotels, rail tickets, and air tickets on your own, you may be spared TCS if you book in INR.

If you pay for the bookings in foreign currency, then once your credit card spends on international transactions cross the Rs 7 lakh threshold, 20 percent TCS will kick in even in this case. What is, however, not yet clear is whether this TCS will get collected at the time of making a payment or will it later reflect in your credit card statement. Tax experts whom we spoke with believe the latter is more likely.

To be sure, Moneycontrol’s search for international flights and hotel rooms on OTAs such as MakeMyTrip, EaseMyTrip, and Expedia, among others, for travel in July does not show TCS in the cost break-up for such bookings. On the other hand, searching for holiday packages on a few Indian OTA websites does show TCS as part of the booking cost, even if your holiday cost is less than Rs 7 lakh. TCS is added to the holiday package price which is inclusive of GST.

Until there is more clarity from the government on many of these aspects, it’s a wait-and-watch situation for those planning foreign holidays.

When asked what made him most happy about investing, legendary investor the late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala had once replied in jest, ‘When the dividends come in June’.

Most retail investors though when buying stocks focus more on capital appreciation than the potential of sustained dividend. That is why they should pay special attention to brokerage CLSA’s latest edition of Bits and Pieces by Damian Kestel.

In its weekly newsletter, the foreign broking firm reiterates that dividends make a significant contribution to total return over time. The classic example that it cites is Warren Buffett’s dividend bonanza over the years from Coca-Cola.

In 1994, Berkshire Hathaway received $75 million cash dividend from Coke. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Given the total cost of purchase was $1.3 billion, the dividend yield comes to ~50 percent for 2022.

Noting this, CLSA calculated what the yield in 2023 would be on some Asia Pacific large caps if an investor was lucky enough to buy at a 15-year low and receive a 2023 dividend.

In the past ten years, the MSCI Asia Pacific index is up 18.8 percent in price. ""But, if dividends were re-invested then the index would have been 57 percent higher,"" according to the latest Bits & Pieces report.

Among names like Samsung, TSMC and Macquarie, India's Tata Consultancy Services and ITC find a spot in CLSA's list.

If an investor had purchased TCS stock at a 15-year low of Rs 103.5, he/she would stand to receive Rs 124 in dividend, indicating a yield of a whopping 120 percent.

Similarly, ITC fetches a yield of 36 percent on its 15-year low price which, in Kestel's words, is ""not bad for a sin stock"". ITC's dividend per share keeps rising under an improved capital allocation policy, which offers good support to the stock, according to the broking firm.

Another Indian stock that catches CLSA's eye is PowerGrid. The company raised its dividend by 26 percent year-on-year to Rs 14.75 in FY23. Moreover, it also said in an analyst call that it does not intend to hoard cash which only means consistent dividend growth in coming years.

Though Vedanta is one of the highest dividend-paying stocks in India, CLSA highlighted in its report that it is more to do with cash requirement at the parent level to pay off debt rather than rewarding investors.

The bottom line: a dividend is a gift that keeps on giving. ""Financial magic can occur when you invest in a company with a policy (and the operational means) of increasing its dividends and then go to the beach,"" writes Kestel.

Effective July 1, 2023, the Indian government has raised the tax collection at source (TCS) rate on foreign remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) from 5 percent to 20 percent. The LRS allows resident Indians to transfer funds abroad without restrictions, up to a specified limit. However, recent developments, including the removal of an exemption for international credit card usage and clarifications regarding certain transactions, have brought about significant changes in the landscape of foreign remittances and their taxation. Let's delve deeper into the details and implications of these updates.

The genesis

With a view to widen and deepen the tax base, Section 206C(1G) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act) was introduced effective from October 1, 2020. This provides for collecting TCS on foreign remittances through the LRS and on the sale of overseas tour packages. While there is a threshold of Rs 7 lakh per annum, over which TCS would apply for foreign remittances, there is no such threshold for sale on overseas tour program packages.

To give some perspective, the LRS scheme allows resident Indians to remit funds outside India without any restrictions or obtaining prior approval of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). All resident individuals (including minors) can remit up to US$250,000 per financial year under LRS for any permissible current or capital account transaction. For remittance exceeding the specified limit, prior approval of RBI is required. As per Rule 5 of Foreign Exchange Management (Current Account Transactions) Rules, 2000, individuals can avail foreign exchange for the purposes mentioned in Schedule III of the said Rules. This covers private visits to any country (except Nepal and Bhutan), gifts or donations, going abroad for employment, emigration, maintenance of close relatives abroad, travel for business, expenses in connection with medical treatment abroad, studies abroad and any other current account transaction. This excludes payment made from funds held in Resident Foreign Currency Account.

Recent development

The Government of India, vide its notification dated 16 May 2023, has omitted Rule 7 of the FEM (CAT) Rules, 2000. The aforesaid Rule 7 exempted use of international credit cards from LRS for payments by a person towards meeting expenses while such person is abroad. Thus, while payments through credit cards from India or payments through debit cards were covered under LRS, if international credit cards were used outside India, an exemption was available earlier under Rule 7. Thus, credit card transactions too have been brought on the same footing as debit card transactions. The rationale behind the same as explained by the FAQs issued by the Finance Ministry was to bring spending overseas through international credit cards under the LRS and to curb individuals from exceeding their LRS limit.

The rates and threshold for TCS (applicable from July 1, 2023) vary according to the amount per financial year and the purpose of remittances. <see table>

Impact on credit card spend

As the usage of credit cards would not fall under remittance for education, medical treatment or sale of overseas tour packages, it would fall under ‘any other remittance’. It would therefore be subject to TCS at the rate of 20 percent with effect from July 1, 2023.

However, relaxation has been extended to business visits of employees and it has been clarified that LRS would not cover expenses incurred on such trips and they would be deemed as current account transactions, subject to verifying the bona fide of the transaction.

Further, due to concerns raised from various quarters, it has been clarified by the Ministry of Finance vide its clarification dated May 19, 2023, that any payments by an individual using their debit or credit cards up to Rs 7 lakh per financial year would be outside the purview of LRS.

It has also been clarified in the FAQs that TCS on remittance for travel and incidental expenses related to education and medical treatment, would be same as that applicable for education and medical treatment itself. This would be a relief to persons remitting for education or medical treatment abroad.

Thus, the new changes could impact high networth individuals making investments overseas and those making payments for the purchase of overseas tour packages. It may be noted that TCS on credit cards could be adjusted against the taxes payable.

The aggregate revenue per employee for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Wipro, and HCLTech, with the exception of Infosys and Tech Mahindra, experienced a decline of 3.8-11 percent on a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) basis in FY23. This decline was driven by the increase in hiring across these companies in response to the Covid pandemic-driven demand, surpassing net revenue growth, which remained relatively slow paced due to lower margins in digital deals.

Revenue per employee is a metric that is used to roughly calculate the revenue generated by each employee in a firm, in a given time frame. Aggregate revenue per employee is calculated based on the total headcount of a company, while billable revenue per employee only includes the people who are billable on a project. This means that billable revenue per employee does not consider adjacent function staff, such as HR, finance, or sales.

HCLTech experienced the biggest dip in CAGR, with a decline of 11 percent. However, its aggregate revenue per employee, at $55,704, is the highest among its top 5 peers (Infosys and Tech Mahindra are the other two in that list). The significant decline can be attributed to a mismatch between its headcount growth and revenue growth, as evident in data from market intelligence firm UnearthInsight, accessed by Moneycontrol.

Over the last five years, HCLTech's headcount grew at a CAGR of 63.8 percent, while its revenue grew at the rate of 45.8 percent. Similarly, Wipro saw 40.5 percent CAGR in headcount for a 35.2 percent CAGR in revenue for the same period.

An HCLTech spokesperson told Moneycontrol, ""Over the past several years, HCLTech has consistently delivered industry-leading organic revenue growth. In recent years, the proportion of work delivered by our India-based and nearshore employees has gone up, which yields lower revenue per employee compared to high-cost locations.""

""Further larger induction of freshers with longer training cycles has contributed to the change in revenue per employee,” the spokesperson added.

Infosys was the only company in the services segment with revenue exceeding $10 billion to achieve a positive 2.6 percent CAGR in aggregate revenue per employee over the past five years. On the other hand, Tech Mahindra experienced approximately 5.6 percent growth in aggregate revenue per employee during the same period, driven by improved billing (both Tech/BPM) and operational efficiency, including reductions in non-billable and support headcount.

The overall billable revenue per employee for the remaining IT/tech services industry combined was $48,195 in FY23, in contrast to $53,550 for the top five players.

Low margins, slower revenue growth

According to Gaurav Vasu, founder and CEO of UnearthInsight, this trend in the revenue per employee metric was due to technology billing rates becoming a lot more commoditised, coupled with a sudden increase in overall headcount.

However, he added, “Linearity between revenue growth and headcount addition still exists in the sub-services and BPO services segments. There are some pockets of services and offerings that have started seeing a non-linear trend.”

Unlike the popular belief that a significant uptick in larger digital deals along with talent hiring will lead to higher revenue per employee, the margins for such deals have been lower. Today, most of the deals bagged by IT companies are digital transformation deals.

“Over the last few years, IT companies have been under tremendous cost pressures from clients and competition alike — margins have come down significantly. As a result, the revenue for the same number of people is much lower. That’s a secular trend across companies,” Ashutosh Sharma, head of research, Forrester Research India, said.

Mrinal Rai, principal analyst at technology research firm ISG, concurred. “Digital deals may not always be high-value deals. Initially revenue grew across IT companies and then they started hiring a lot more than they needed. Now, they have started cutting down the workforce. FY19 and FY23 are very different stories,” he said.

Emailed queries sent to TCS, Infosys, Wipro and Tech Mahindra didn't elicit any response at the time of publishing.

Headcount addition trends

This slowdown in aggregate revenue per employee for some companies on a five-year CAGR basis is also because the IT companies weren’t hiring much for three years pre-pandemic, according to HDFC Securities’ deputy vice-president Amit Chandra.

“A lot of capacity building happened during the post-Covid demand surge. The hiring trend between FY16-19 was negligible. That was the era when it was thought that automation will reduce human effort and legacy hiring will fall very sharply. But it did not happen, there was a sudden IT talent scarcity with the post-covid demand surge. Especially last year, there was pyramid broadening,” he said.

While most IT companies thought that automation and the shift to getting more digital deals will decrease higher employee dependency, creating a non-linear relation between revenue growth and headcount increase unlike in earlier times, that wasn’t the case for all.

Sharma said that it also depends on the organisation’s ability to move away from headcount-based revenue models. Infosys, for instance, has done a marginally better job than its peers in bringing platform-based solutions and services into deals, which delinks revenue from the headcount.

“TCS, HCLTech and Wipro could do better in this area. TCS has a big success in BaNCS, but they struggle replicating that in other verticals. HCLTech and Wipro have some capabilities in DRYiCE and Holmes respectively but not much to show beyond these,” he added.

The IT sector reported record hiring numbers in FY22, both in lateral hiring and fresher additions. The top five firms collectively added around 273,377 employees by the end of the fiscal year. This increase in hiring was driven by the growing demand for digital transformation deals and the shortage of tech talent in the market.

However, this trend reversed in FY23 due to various macroeconomic challenges, including the Russia-Ukraine war, an impending recession in key markets like the US, inflation, interest rate hikes, and most recently, a global banking crisis.

As a result, there was a significant year-on-year drop of over 69 percent in hiring across the top five firms in FY23. Together, these firms only added 83,906 employees as the focus shifted towards improving utilisation rates.

How TCS and Infosys fared

TCS, the largest IT services company in the country, witnessed the second-lowest aggregate revenue per employee, with a decline of 7.8 percent in a five-year CAGR. According to Vasu, a part of the reason for this was TCS having a significant chunk of its revenue from the domestic market as compared to its peers, which means the billing rates will be lower.

“TCS’ revenue per employee growth is also low because a significant chunk of their revenue comes from the domestic India market. It gets almost $2 billion or more of its revenue from India, and has the highest presence among its peers,” Vasu said.

Rightly so, in FY23, TCS reported the highest revenue contribution from India, at 5 percent, while Infosys earned 3.2 percent, and Wipro reported 4 percent, respectively. The IT sector, overall, earns less than 5 percent of its total revenue from India, as the US and Europe remain the key markets.

Meanwhile, Infosys, the second-largest IT services company in India, witnessed 2.6 percent growth in aggregate revenue per employee due to its ability to sustain billing rates. Additionally, the company successfully managed to add a lower headcount for the revenue it generated, according to Vasu.

Furthermore, Infosys continues to maintain lean project management structures as well as leaner internal IT, HR, and sales teams, Vasu added. He expects the revenue per employee metric for these IT companies to start improving in the coming fiscal years.

“The revenue per employee will start improving in FY24 and FY25 because the biggest dip came in FY21 when the companies expected higher growth and they hired a lot. Right now hiring is seeing a downtrend, so we expect a lot more focus on improving productivity and a lot of caution-based hiring to happen,” Vasu said.

“Aggregate revenue per employee at an industry level will start going down by 2-5 percent over the next 12-18 months,” he added.",1343,0.059799847395523735

When N Chandrasekaran (59) and K Krithivasan (58) studied at Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore Institute of Technology (CIT) in the early 1980s, little did they know that their futures would unfold in remarkably similar ways.

On March 16, CIT added another feather to its cap when K Krithivasan was named CEO and MD-designate of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest IT services firm.

This marks the second instance of a CIT graduate leading TCS, with the first being none other than Chandrasekaran. The former CEO is now the chairman of the company’s parent, Tata Sons.

However, Chandra and Krithi, as they are called, have more in common than an alma mater. They both have a lifelong association with TCS and the Tata group, share a passion for running, and are willing to live out of a suitcase if it leads to better chances of client closures and deal wins.

“Krithi has already started to travel like crazy. He was in the US, EU, and London twice. He is very similar to Chandra (N Chandrasekaran, the chairman of Tata Sons). He will go as many times as a client asks him to for a deal,” an industry analyst said.

A senior official at TCS concurred with this assessment. “That is an accurate description. He is very customer oriented. Internally, he is popular and gets along very well with other leaders.”

An alumnus of CIT and IIT Kanpur, Krithivasan takes over the TCS reins on June 1 as the fifth CEO in its over-five-decade-long history. While Krithi was based in Chennai, he has been operating out of the TCS guest house in Mumbai for the last few months and will start house hunting soon as his family will be relocating. An avid reader, he has also been taking an intensive Sanskrit course over the last few years.

At 58, he will be one of the seniormost executives in the company to be appointed CEO. Prior to this, he was the global head of TCS’s Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) Business Group, which contributes around 35 percent of the company’s revenue.

Krithi takes charge at a time when growth is slowing down for the IT sector due to uncertainties, and caution in key markets such as the US and Europe.

In his tenure at TCS spanning over 33 years, Krithivasan has maintained a low profile, but those who have known him describe him as a hard-working, execution-driven leader, who is also approachable and cordial. According to a recent note by Kotak Institutional Equities, he managed a large BFSI portfolio of $11 billion.

Ronak Doshi, partner at Everest Group, who has interacted with Krithi over the last five years, said he is respected by clients and focused on outcomes.

“He has a lot of credibility among the analyst and investor community as a client-facing P&L owner. He is highly accessible to clients and has empowered his leadership team to act in the best interest of the client,” Doshi told Moneycontrol.

Driven, focused and smart — that’s how Phil Fersht, CEO of HFS Research, an outsourcing research firm, describes Krithivasan, with whom he has been acquainted over the years. “He seems smart, articulate, and really knows the business. He also has a warm, empathetic manner to motivate key people to deliver for the firm,” Fersht said.

When Chandrasekaran moved to Tata Sons, Krithivasan was one of the frontrunners to replace him, before outgoing CEO Rajesh Gopinathan was picked for the top job in 2017. While most disappointed frontrunners tend to quit, Krithi stayed back and continued to perform.

His growth trajectory at TCS has many parallels with that of Chandra. He learnt the company’s business and operations ground-up, having worked in delivery, pre-sales, sales and large client groups.

As he settles into his new role at the corner office, the focus will be on ensuring growth in key markets such as the US and Europe, and striking the right balance between growth-focused large deal wins and small/ mid-sized deals, analysts said.

What to expect?

TCS began calendar year 2023 on a good note. It has already bagged three mega deals of over $700 million. These include a $723-million deal from UK-based insurer Phoenix Group and another one with British retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S). Though the exact deal size was not disclosed, the M&S deal was worth $1 billion, according to reports.

Most recently, a consortium led by TCS received an advance purchase order for a $1.8-billion-plus deal from government-owned telco Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) to deploy its 4G network across India.

Beyond deal win prospects, travelling and meeting clients in person to understand market and demand cycles will top Krithi’s agenda as he takes charge. He will also be looking at building a better connect with TCS’ employees. Krithivasan is already regarded as an empathetic leader and consensus builder within the company.

TCS’ cautious approach

Perhaps the biggest news about TCS in 2022 was its business restructuring plan and what it really meant. The company had unveiled four distinctive business groups based on the client’s journey with the company, instead of verticals based on business sectors and geographies.

These groups were the acquisition group, relationship incubation group, enterprise group and finally business transformation group. Apparently, not many within the company liked this model. In a previous report, Moneycontrol had reported that Krithivasan himself was not happy with the reorganisation plan and decided to keep his vertical out of it. Also, TCS is yet to start reporting group-wise revenue and growth numbers.

Analysts Moneycontrol spoke to are now waiting to hear an update on the same. “This rejig has caused considerable unrest among senior executives and vertical heads. The new CEO needs to take a call on whether to continue with the restructuring or roll back the proposed changes,” Everest’s Doshi said.

For FY24, in terms of business, TCS has already alluded to the mix of deals in its bookings being more near-term, quick ROI-based small-to-medium term deals (aligned with the cost agenda of clients), implying a faster degree of revenue conversion in the future.

Gopinathan’s farewell

On May 30, Gopinathan, whose exit stunned the industry, sent out a heartfelt internal note to employees as his last day as the CEO neared. Gopinathan expressed gratitude, and also highlighted some interesting milestones from his six-year-long tenure.

TCS’ revenues grew from $17.5 billion in March 2017 to $27.9 billion in March 2023, he wrote. During this period, the company’s market capitalisation grew from $74 billion to $143 billion, and it returned over Rs 2 trillion ($27.3 billion) to shareholders through dividend and share buybacks.

Gopinathan, also a TCS lifer, expressed gratitude to his predecessors FC Kohli, S Ramadorai and N Chandrasekharan.

He welcomed Krithivasan saying TCS’s best years are ahead. “I wish Krithi the very best as he takes over the TCS baton and charts the way forward to our $50 billion aspiration,” he wrote.",1155,0.3554458071788152

Small may not always be beautiful, but it certainly merits a second look, at least in the IT space. With the Indian IT sector buffeted by global macro headwinds, analysts are of the view that one of the best bets to ride out the storm would be the smaller IT firms, which are projected to sustain their growth premium over the tier-1 pack.

The domestic IT industry largely delivered a disappointing Q4 show amid the gathering clouds of recession in the West and the banking crisis in the US – the bread-and-butter market for India’s software service exporters.

“The macro challenges are manifesting into a set of outcomes for the sector ranging from cuts in discretionary spending, delay in decision making (slower conversion from pipeline to total contract value or TCV), slower deal ramp-up, to change in the propensity for price increases/volume discounts,” HDFC Securities said in a recent report.

However, the deteriorating operative environment and soured sentiment are bigger worries for frontline IT companies.

“India tier-1 IT has a high correlation to S&P500 revenue growth, which includes large customers across verticals and the growth rate is expected to decelerate over the next two quarters,” analysts at HDFC Securities added.

Of course, there are gradations of pain within the tier-1 pack.

HDFC Securities believes Tech Mahindra and Infosys have a higher risk from large clients moderating spend, and TCS scores above Infosys both in BFSI and non-BFSI industry verticals.

“Mid-tier IT on average scores slightly above tier-1 IT, supported by ER&D companies,” it said. “Mid-tier IT growth premium is expected to continue—both on revenue growth and profit growth in FY24E, supported by vertical and enterprise-specific drivers.”

Growth Drivers

A key driver is the engineering R&D (ER&D) segment within the manufacturing vertical.

Interestingly, the manufacturing vertical (including industrials and automotive) had the highest count of enterprises increasing their outlook and beating the estimates this earnings season.

In a recent note on L&T Technology Services (LTTS), Motilal Oswal too highlighted the contribution of this segment.

“We continue to view LTTS as a beneficiary of the growing penetration of ER&D services,” it noted, adding that digitization is driving the accelerated spends in ER&D.

Stating that ER&D pureplay guidance for FY24E is a strong growth premium over tier-1 IT, HDFC Securities said Cyient, Tata Elxsi and L&T Technology Services are expected to grow above the low-teens for FY24E as compared to mid-single-digit growth expected for tier-1 IT firms.

Head-to-head: TCS trounces Infosys on all fronts of financials

In a recent report, Kotak Institutional Equities too said it expects mid-tier companies with strong domain understanding and capabilities to beat tier-1 companies in terms of growth.

“Quality mid-tier [companies] can deliver double-digit growth in FY2024. Portfolio mix that is tuned to growth with lower legacy drag, quality management team and strong sales focus are aiding healthy growth even in a less friendly environment,” the brokerage said.

However, it added that tier-1 companies that offer a full suite of services are most likely to weather the slowdown.

Tata Consultancy Services’ outgoing CEO Rajesh Gopinathan penned an emotional note to employees as he prepares to step down on May 31, after six years at the helm of the company. In a note sent on May 29, Gopinathan recounted the high points during his tenure, stating that the software firm grew revenues by $10.4 billion and returned $27.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.

He reflected on his 22 years in the company in an email to employees, stating that the company's best days are ahead, a day before he steps down as the CEO and hands over the baton to K Krithivasan on June 1.

“I wish Krithi the very best as he takes over the TCS baton and charts the way forward to our $50 billion aspiration, I am confident that TCS' best years are ahead, and I look forward to cheering all of you and your continued success from outside,” he said.

The outgoing CEO said in the letter that they have set the gold standard in the industry for financial performance, and that it was TCS’ focus on “operational rigor, strategic transformation, innovation, and profitable growth has helped TCS grow revenues from $17.5 billion in March 2017 to $27.9 billion in March 2023.”

He added that during this time, TCS' market capitalisation has gone from $74 billion to $143 billion.

Gopinathan looked back on his time at the company, saying that this week marks the culmination of his two-decade-long journey with TCS. “I will step down from my role as CEO & MD on 31 May, 2023. It has been an absolute privilege to lead our company in the last six years, which have been a period of tremendous growth and transformation for all of us.”

During his tenure, Gopinathan said the company undertook redefinition of the service portfolio and market positioning to integrate its offerings, developed newer capabilities and services, and increased engagement with clients.

“We also undertook an ambitious redefinition of TCS' service portfolio and market positioning by introducing the Business 4.0 and Growth & Transformation frameworks to integrate our technology services offerings with greater focus on business value delivered,"" he said.

""Awareness, articulation and amplification of the value we deliver is going to be critical for our success in the years ahead...In a world of Al and automation, our ability to continuously enhance and leverage contextual knowledge is what will differentiate us and position us as the partners of choice for our customers,"" he added.

Gopinathan stressed on the company’s focus on Agile, Automation and cloud, terming the company capitalising on the cloud opportunity as helping it emerge as top global partner of all three leading cloud providers. “Combining this with increasing investments and focus on our field sales teams helped us expand our customer base across markets and increase the number of customers, contributing more than $100 million in annual revenue from 35 to 60,” he said.

TCS lifer Gopinathan will stay on till September to smooth over the transition for his successor, K Krithivasan, who takes over the mantle of CEO on June 1.

Gopinathan's abrupt exit took all stakeholders by surprise, considering the storied IT firm has had just 4 CEOs in its 55-year history — FC Kohli, S Ramadorai, N Chandrasekharan, and then Gopinathan. It also comes at a particularly fraught time for the IT industry at large, which is facing a slowdown amid increasing headwinds.

""I am grateful to have had the privilege to helm the TCS journey for the last six years, and carry on the proud legacy of Mr Kohli, Ram and Chandra. I want to especially thank Chandra, our Chairman, for his mentorship over the years,"" Gopinathan said.

Amid summer holidays that vacationers prefer to spend in cooler climes overseas, the government’s recent move to levy Tax Collected at Source (TCS) on international transactions using credit cards came as an unpleasant surprise.

The Ministry of Finance notified that such transactions would come under the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) with effect from May 16, 2023. And by virtue of that, these transactions are now subject to 5 percent TCS until June 30 and thereafter, at 20 percent.

Following much opposition, the government clarified that TCS would apply on international spending via debit or credit cards only beyond the threshold of Rs 7 lakh a year.

In this backdrop, we bring you this Q&A with Sandeep Jhunjhunwala, Partner at Nangia Andersen LLP, explaining what TCS is, what all transactions it applies to, and more. Edited excerpts:

What is TCS and why does the government levy it?

TCS is actually a tax on spending. It is collected from a buyer and has to be deposited by the seller to the income tax authorities. I'll give you an example.

If I buy any car of value exceeding Rs 10 lakh, then the car dealer will collect an additional tax from me on this spending. If the price of the car is Rs 50 lakh and there is 1 percent TCS on it, then the dealer will collect Rs 50,000 from me – Rs 50 lakh will go into his account as sale consideration of the car and Rs 50,000 will go to the tax department as TCS. The TCS will show in my Form 26AS (which shows details of TCS collected and TDS or Tax Deducted at Source for each year).

TCS is a tax on expense and TDS is a tax on income (such as salary and interest income). However, unlike TDS, TCS is never deducted and it is always over and above the base amount.

For example, if I have to pay you Rs 100, I will deduct TDS of Rs 10 and give you the remainder Rs 90. On the other hand, TCS is over and above the sale amount. The way TCS works is that as a buyer, I will add Rs 10 (TCS) to the Rs 100 that I have to give to the seller. That is, I pay Rs 110 – of this Rs 100 will go to the car dealer and Rs 10 to the tax department.

Traditionally TCS was supposed to be levied only on certain transactions (B2B or business to business), where the buyer and seller were defined in a certain way under the income tax law. So, for example, a business with gross receipts of more than Rs 10 crore in a year and engaged in activities such as selling scrap or selling alcoholic liquor for human consumption etc., was brought under the TCS net, whereby the government wanted to possibly collect tax by way of an additional levy.

But over a period of time, instead of being seen as a tax, TCS has also become a spend-tracking mechanism for the tax department. And I think that's what the government has intended to do with TCS on LRS and overseas tour package transactions. Having said that, I think a 20 percent rate for tracking transactions definitely seems extremely high.

Apart from the TCS on LRS transactions and purchase of overseas tour packages, are there any other transactions at a consumer level where TCS is levied?

The only other situation is purchase of a motor vehicle or a car, where the value of it exceeds Rs 10 lakh. In this case, 1 percent TCS applies.

Are there situations where a higher than the normally applicable rate of TCS may be levied on a transaction?

There are two situations under the Income Tax Act where a higher rate of TCS can apply. The first situation is where the person (buyer) has not filed his ITR (Income Tax Return) for two financial years and the total of his TCS and TDS liability in each of these two financial series was more than Rs 50,000. Then, double the TCS rate will apply.

So, as in the car buying example, the car dealership will apply TCS of 2 percent instead of 1 percent. Using the buyer’s PAN, the collector can identify if the buyer falls in this category by using the tax department utility.

The second situation is if the buyer doesn't have a PAN (Permanent Account Number). Then, again, double the TCS rate applies.

At the time of filing the ITR, one can adjust the TCS collected against one’s tax liability for the year. But if I have no tax dues to adjust the TCS against, then what happens?

If you are not liable for taxes, definitely the TCS will come back to you as a tax refund. The only catch is you will have to file an income tax return for this. You cannot get this refund if you are not filing your income tax return.

The other catch here is that you will lose on the time value of money because say, the TCS got collected in May or June of a particular year, whereas you file your return in July of the subsequent year and then possibly get a refund within another 2-3 months from thereon. So, you are losing interest on this amount for a certain period.

The rate of interest on refunds is 0.5 percent every month or part of the month and is applicable from April 1 of an assessment year till the date of grant of refund. However, this is applicable only when an individual files his/ her returns within the due date as notified by the tax department. In all other cases, interest on the refund is calculated for the period covering the date of furnishing the return till grant of refund.

Suppose the TCS collector (car dealer or tour operator, for example) fails to collect TCS or does not pass the TCS collected to the tax department. Will the buyer get into trouble for this?

In both these situations, the person collecting the TCS would be considered as the defaulter because the buyer has discharged his liabilities to the TCS collector. In both cases, the TCS collector will be liable for interest (1 percent per month) and in the second case where TCS was collected and not remitted to the tax department, the person could be liable for penalty too. There could also be prosecution against the person who has not deposited the TCS money to the tax department.

I have paid TCS during the year but it still does not reflect in Form 26AS. What’s the way out?

This could happen if the TCS collector took the TCS from the buyer, but did not file TCS returns. In that case, the only recourse available is to go back to the TCS collector (the car dealer, for example) and ask him to file TCS returns so that it reflects in your Form 26AS. Without this, you will not be able to adjust the TCS or claim refund for it, as it does not reflect in Form 26AS.

You can raise your grievance on the income tax portal but that may not help.​

The gap in their YTD performance demonstrates the uphill task confronting Infosys at present.

After a forgettable performance in the fourth quarter, technology behemoths are bracing for more uncertainty in the near-term, thanks to the banking turmoil in US and fears of an impending recession. Management commentary from both TCS and Infosys paint a grim picture. Growth, margins and discretionary tech spends remain areas of concern.

However, while most analysts still have a ‘buy’ call on both the IT majors, TCS comprehensively beats Infosys on most parameters, even as it commands a higher price multiple.

Financials: It is mostly a choice between bad and worse. While TCS results missed expectations, Infosys’ numbers were a punch to the gut. Revenues, profit, and margin declined sequentially. This was in stark contrast to the past few quarters when Infosys had managed to outshine the IT sector bellwether.

A bigger jolt came in the form of a cut in FY24 revenue forecast to 4-7% by Infosys. This is markedly lower than the 13-15% forecasted for FY23.

TCS does not give guidance but a deterioration in growth is widely anticipated. But based on the Q4 narrative, Infosys seems to be on a weaker wicket.

“Between TCS and Infosys, the growth outlook for TCS is better -- TCS has a much diversified portfolio and the order book is pretty strong with a strong, healthy pipeline,” said Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Market Moves: Shares of TCS and Infosys have seen contrasting fortunes since their results, in tandem with the Street commentary. The gap in their YTD performance demonstrates the uphill task confronting Infosys at present.

Analysts’ Views: The verdict on TCS remains largely unchanged even post its muted show in Q4, mainly due to its healthy order book. Infosys, on the other hand, has suffered a steep 28 percent drop in ‘buy’ calls.

Valuations: IT stocks have seen a correction over the past year, which has brought down their valuation multiples below the 10-year averages. However, TCS is an exception here as it trades above its 10-year average of 22.58x. At a trailing PE of 25.7x, TCS commands a premium to Infosys which is trading at 16.6x currently (below its 10-year average of 19.5x).

Historically, TCS has always commanded premium valuations vis-à-vis Infosys, though the gap has narrowed over the past few quarters as the Tata Group firm’s growth trailed that of Infosys. In fact, in some instances their valuations have even converged (March 2022 and March 2021).

HDFC Institutional Equities expects Infosys to grow less than TCS in FY24, based on portfolio mix (relative differential between North America and UK portfolio and the relative weakness and strength in those geographies). Thus, it values Infosys at a 20 percent discount to TCS’ valuations.

Gaurang Shah of Geojit Financial Services says, “Our order of preference is TCS followed by HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, and Infosys. We are most cautious on Infosys when it comes to deal wins.”

AK Prabhakar of IDBI Capital echoes this view. “Despite trading at a premium, we have always been bullish on TCS as it has a diversified client set.”

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) launched its enterprise-level generative AI offering, TCS Generative, in extended partnership with Google Cloud to offer customised AI-based business solutions. The announcement follows TCS' COO N Ganapathy Subramaniam (NGS) comments on increasing demand from clients across sectors to integrate generative AI in the March quarter.

TCS has been running pilots on developing the solution and has plans to have a centre of excellence around the technology.

The new offering announced will leverage most of Google Cloud’s Generative AI tools – Vertex AI, Generative AI Application Builder and Model Garden, and TCS’ own solutions, according to a company statement.

TCS will use its client-specific contextual knowledge, its own IPs, design thinking and agile development processes to ideate solutions jointly with clients, prototyping the most promising ideas and build full-fledged transformation solutions with enhanced time to value.

The collaborative research for the same will happen at the company’s co-innovation hubs located in New York, Pittsburg, Toronto, Amsterdam and Tokyo, where clients can also engage with academic researchers and start-up partners from TCS’ extended innovation ecosystem, the company said in a statement.

Krishnan Ramanujam, President, Enterprise Growth Group, TCS said, “With deep contextual knowledge of our customers’ businesses, we are well positioned to build innovative enterprise-level solutions using generative AI…TCS is investing in assets, frameworks, and talent to harness the power of generative AI to enable growth and transformation for our customers.”

Kevin Ichhpurani, Vice President, Global Partner Ecosystems and Channels, Google Cloud added, “TCS’ expertise in business transformation and its commitment to train thousands of people on Google Cloud Generative AI will be important assets for businesses accelerating their generative AI adoption.”

During TCS' Q4FY23 earnings conference in April, NGS had said, ""In my interactions with all these clients over the last quarter, the conversation starts and stops with ChatGPT. Everybody talks about ChatGPT and what it's going to do. It’s very clear that innovation is surpassing productivity. That kind of theme is what is spanning out in all these deal wins that we have, it's a huge amount of focus on cloud data. At the same time, you know, machine learning is a very, very important area of focus for people.”

Upskilling talent

TCS already has over 25,000 engineers certified on Google Cloud. In addition, TCS has over 50,000 associates trained in AI, with plans to earn 40,000 skill badges on Google Cloud Generative AI within the year, to support the anticipated demand for its new offering.

“While hiring will be a channel for talent acquisition, there will be equal, if not more focus on talent up-skilling and cross-skilling.

A consortium led by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on May 22 announced that it received an Advance Purchase Order (APO) valued at over Rs 15,000 crore (around $1.8 billion) from government-owned telco Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL). This deal will be a shot in the arm for India's largest software exporter coming at a time when its major markets such as US and Europe are slowing down.

With this, TCS will be undertaking deployment of 4G network across India for BSNL, the company confirmed in regulatory filings on BSE.

The consortium includes Tata Group's telecom gear making company Tejas Networks, which will be responsible for supplying and servicing the Radio Access Networks (RAN) equipment.

Along with TCS, the APO was also issued to state-run ITI Ltd for this project. According to analysts, about 20 percent of the work and deal value will go to ITI.

While the deal is revenue boosting for TCS, it could also be margin dilutive with other players being involved.

An analyst seeking anonymity said that the margins from the deal for TCS would stand at less than 10 percent, given that there will be a lot of pass throughs expected. Typically government projects offer margins of around 10 percent.

""But this is a big delta for Tejas Networks and a meaningful win for them,"" the person added.

According to Pareekh Jain, Founder and CEO, EIIRTrend, with Tejas Networks taking over manufacturing of the equipment and hardware needed, margin dilution would be less overall as no other third party player is getting involved outside the consortium.

""The TCS-led consortium include Tejas Networks and C-DOT. The billing for the other two consortium partners will be done directly to them in this deal. So, it won't be that margin dilutive for TCS, but its standalone revenue could come down,” he added.

This will be the IT services behemoth's third major deal in 2023, following a $723-million deal from UK-based Phoenix Group and another one with British retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S). Though the exact deal size was not disclosed, according to reports, the M&S deal was worth $1 billion.

TCS' government project approach

Irrespective of the margin gains, TCS' approach towards government projects has been slightly different from its peers including Infosys. It has been an outlier and has seen better success rate in the industry when it comes to running public-facing government services portals.

TCS sees Indian government projects as a training ground to learn from the complexity and replicate this in the way they architect projects for various countries. The focus is on understanding the scale and not alone on profit margins.

It already runs runs India's passport project, the Indian Railways’ IRCTC site, and India Post’s digital project. TCS' contract for running the Passport Seva Programme was renewed last year in deal worth Rs. 8,000 crores, according to industry sources.

Overall for the IT services sector which count the US and Europe markets as their biggest revenue contributors, India is relatively a smaller market accounting for less than 5 percent of the top IT firms' revenue.

In FY23, TCS reported the highest revenue contribution from India at 5 percent, Infosys earned 3.2 percent and Wipro reported 4 percent revenue from India respectively.

Reviving BSNL

This deal was in talks since September last year.

In July 2022, the Union Cabinet had approved a Rs 1.64 lakh crore revival package for BSNL, which included cash support of Rs 43,964 crore and non-cash support of Rs 1.20 lakh crore.

The package had three main elements - improving the quality of BSNL services, de-stressing the balance sheet, and expanding the fibre reach through merger with Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL).

This TCS-ITI deal is likely to be a part of the same package. BSNL's 4G services are expected to be rolled out across 100,000 towers or sites.",639,0.31680475920438766

Six of the 10 most valued firms faced a combined erosion of Rs 70,486.95 crore in their market valuation last week, with Reliance Industries and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) taking the biggest hit following a weak trend in equities.

Last week, the BSE Sensex declined 298.22 points or 0.48 per cent.

""Markets took a breather last week and shed half a per cent amid mixed cues. The beginning was upbeat, however, profit-taking in heavyweights across sectors pushed the index lower in the following sessions,"" Ajit Mishra, VP - Technical Research at Religare Broking Ltd, said.

Tax collected at Source (TCS) levy on overseas payments made by debit/credit cards is a thoughtless and unconstitutional legislation, which will no doubt be struck down by the courts when challenged.

The constitution has made it clear that there can be no collection of tax without the authority of law. When the income tax act does not impose a levy on expenditure incurred via debit/credit cards, the provision for collection tax on the amount spent abroad is clearly without the authority of law.

The constitutional validity of the law can be challenged before the high courts or the Supreme Court on the basis of the fact that it is against the original principles of the law.

For instance, in spite of being part of the 2018 finance bill, electoral bonds have been challenged on the ground that they are against the established principles of law. Any legislation/rules introduced by Parliament could be termed unconstitutional by the court if it is against the principles of the Constitution.

The provisions of the income tax act stipulate that at the time of payment for a transaction that is to be taxed, a small percentage of the money is deducted at source by the payer, and deposited with the tax authorities. This is what is known as Tax Deduction at Source (TDS). For instance, when a person pays a fee to their lawyer, they deduct 10 percent from the fee towards income tax.

The government has, however, stretched this concept by introducing TCS, a charge that is imposed by the seller on the buyer when certain products are purchased. The government has now levied 20 percent TCS on the usage of a debit/credit cards overseas. For instance, if one were to use a credit card and pay a bus fare of 2 Pounds in London, it will attract 20 percent TCS. If one enjoys a cup of coffee at a Starbucks in New York, that would also attract 20 percent of TCS. This is draconian as the tax is levied at a point where there is no certainty on whether the transaction is even taxable.

The subsequent clarification by the Finance Ministry that overseas expenditure of up to Rs 7 lakh a year will not attract TCS is hardly any relief. The question here is, how will one keep track of this limit and what is the logic for Rs 7 lakh? For frequent business travellers who use corporate credit cards, Rs 7 lakh is a meaningless exemption.

An tax payer will now have to wade through the Income Tax Department's website to check on forms and keep a track of all TCS amounts to claim it as advance tax. By doing this , Government is collecting tax on an event which is not in the bounds of law.

Mere lip service in the name of ease of doing business is a meaningless mantra when individuals are subjected to such unfair and unconstitutional provisions, which will no doubt be struck down when challenged before the court.

The finance ministry may have, after widespread backlash, decided to exempt international spending of up to Rs 7 lakh from tax collected at source (TCS) of 20 percent, but the saga is far from over.

The swift move to introduce the Rs 7-lakh threshold is indicative of the heat generated by the decision to bring credit card spending under the ambit of Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) so that 20 percent TCS could come into play. International credit card spends are under LRS from May 16 and the 20 percent TCS will kick in from July 1, 2023. Until June 30, TCS at the rate of 5 percent will apply.

Moneycontrol brought together top experts from credit cards, foreign exchange and tax domains to decode the chain of events and implications for individuals on its Twitter Spaces session on May 19.

Rohinton Sidhwa, Partner, Deloitte India, Kuldip Kumar, Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP, Sudarshan Motwani, Founder and CEO, BookmyForex.com and Sumanta Mandal, credit card expert and Founder, TechnoFino shared their views and answered queries around this contentious issue. Edited excerpts:

Why were only credit cards left out from the ambit of LRS so far? What was the rationale behind the change in status quo, which has brought credit cards under LRS, attracting TCS of 20 percent beyond spends of Rs 7 lakh in a financial year?

Rohinton Sidhwa: Credit cards have always been left out of the LRS limits. This can be traced back to a rule which was there in regard to our foreign exchange management rules. Essentially, credit cards were difficult to monitor. And they were traditionally left out; debit cards, on the other hand, were covered because debit cards are linked to the bank account. And any transaction from the bank account typically was easily monitored and covered by LRS.

But this distinction has been done away with by a notification from the Ministry of Finance bringing credit cards on par for LRS purposes (effective May 16). And one of the reasons that have been cited is that there was perhaps some sort of abuse of the $250,000 limit, which applied to bank accounts and debit cards but didn't apply to what was not monitored for credit cards. So the finance ministry tried to fix this loophole via this notification.

What are your views on the May 19 finance ministry notification that exempts debit and credit card international transactions of up to Rs 7 lakh a financial year from TCS?

Kuldip Kumar: This is good news. People who are going on holiday, meeting relatives etc will heave a sigh of relief now.

But is the TCS rate justifiable? A huge amount will now be blocked upfront and claiming credit or refund will be time-consuming…

Kuldip Kumar: The 20 percent rate is very high. Now, the government is using technology in return processing and otherwise, and they are providing prefilled data and return forms. All financial transactions are pretty much visible to the taxman. In that context 20 percent seems to be a little harsh, people should not have to first pay the taxes and then struggle to claim the refund by filing the returns.

Is there any way out for travellers wanting to minimise the TCS impact?

Sumanta Mandal: I would say just use a credit card here in India, collect rewards and use that for booking your hotel and flight. That's it. No other options, in my opinion.

Rohinton Sidhwa: I will say that (this is possible) only if someone has worked outside India and has an income earned from overseas and is keeping money in a resident foreign currency account. And if you make the payments from that account then these get excluded from the LRS then probably you can avoid the TCS on that. But anyway, this will be applicable only to select people or some business persons who have RFC accounts with the banks.

Can resident Indians try to avoid this TCS on credit card transactions by asking their relatives or friends living abroad to make payments on their behalf and then reimburse the amount? Would this be a legally tenable way of avoiding TCS?

Rohinton Sidhwa: The obligation of a resident being met by a non-resident is a permissible transaction under FEMA. But, I would hasten to add that that may not be something that can be done. Obviously, a relative can make a gift of foreign exchange to an Indian resident, so, that is certainly permissible. But, if the idea is to pay first and then reimburse later in some way or the other, then that is not permissible under the law.

In the case of prepaid forex cards, when is TCS deducted – when you buy the card, load it or when actually use it while travelling abroad?

Sudarshan Motwani: Be it foreign currency notes, Forex prepaid cards, or, for that matter, foreign international remittances, the TCS is collected upfront. You can buy a Forex card and you're allowed to keep around $2,000 with you, but then you have to pay the TCS from the entire amount, irrespective of whether you use it in one trip or in multiple trips.

What about subscriptions to publications such as Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Economist, and services such as iTunes and Spotify? Would those transactions, executed while sitting in India, also be affected now?

Sumanta Mandal: Yes, these will be affected. I mean, if you are making any transaction in USD (or any other foreign currency) then you have to pay 20 percent TCS if it breaches the Rs 7 lakh threshold that is now applicable. So, most users will escape TCS as the subscriptions will not cost more than Rs 7 lakh per year.

Rohinton Sidhwa: A lot of these subscriptions are actually paid in INR. And it's usually the companies who actually have a system with the RBI, they usually collect the money in INR and they themselves then remit it outside India. So the examples mentioned in the question… the companies would be collecting INR and not foreign exchange so they wouldn't be covered by the LRS in the first place.

Let's say you are travelling abroad via a domestic tour company and you are paying them in INR, but it's a foreign tour. So even those also would be under LRS and attract TCS?

Sudarshan Motwani: Just because you are paying in INR does not mean that it is not a foreign tour. It is LRS because eventually, the tour operator is paying in foreign currency.

Could you explain the process of claiming TCS credit and refund?

Rohinton Sidhwa: TCS shows up as a credit in your 26AS. And because it shows up as a credit in your 26AS, you can offset it against any tax payable, which is there, when you file your tax return, or when you pay advanced taxes. In case you're not able to offset this amount against taxes payable or any other form of TCS, then in that case, it is available as cash after you file your tax return and is determined as a refund.

What if I spend Rs 5 lakh each using different credit cards? I'm crossing the Rs 7 lakh threshold collectively, but on the individual card, I'm not crossing the Rs 7 lakh threshold...

Sudarshan Motwani: We had a Rs 7 lakh threshold for overseas remittances, for purchase of foreign currency bank notes and for forex travel card - each of these was being tracked by the individual service providers and that was the problem. Threshold has this problem.

So, today LRS is being monitored by the banks because there is a centralised server setup and the RBI, which actually track through the PAN card every amount of foreign exchange that is reported. So LRS right now is being tracked. But the banks still won't know if a bank has – if somebody's done a remittance beyond 7 lakh - somewhere only $250,000 limit is being monitored. This is what my knowledge is right now.

How can those who do not file returns, senior citizens over 75, for instance, claim TCS credit or refund?

Kuldip Kumar: Unfortunately, they will have to file the return to claim the refund. As of now, there doesn't seem to be any other mechanism. And I think the unfortunate part is that they will lose interest in that amount during the period until the refund is processed.",1455,-0.5654987990856171

The Ministry of Finance on May 16 notified the Foreign Exchange Management (Current Account Transactions) (Amendment) Rules, 2023, to include international credit card payments in the LRS. Any remittance beyond $2.5 lakh or its equivalent in foreign currency would require approval from the RBI.

The government decision has drawn a lot of flak from several experts, others from various walks of life.

Elaborating on the several impacts of the change in taxation on foreign spend, Sandeep Pravin Parekh, Managing Partner, Finsec Law Advisors, said, ""Tax deduction for foreign expenses is wrong and the justifications are even more wrong.""

In a longish post, Parekh tweeted, ""This will not prevent money laundering, it will CAUSE money laundering. Who wants to pay 125$ for a 100$ product.""



Dear Sir, Tax deduction for foreign expenses is wrong and the justifications are even more wrong: Parity between debit and credit cards is thinking two wrongs make a right. They don’t. For tracing, if at all a 0.1% rate (like in property deals is right) would work - people who…

The Union Budget 2023-24 hiked TCS rates to 20 per cent, from 5 per cent currently, on overseas tour packages and funds remitted under LRS (other than for education and medical purposes).

Facing backlash, the Ministry of Finance issued Frequently Asked Questions regarding 20 percent TCS. It stated that the payment of TCS is not a final tax. If the TCS payee is a taxpayer, he can claim credit for the TCS as his tax payment against regular income and adjust it against the advance tax etc., payments accordingly.",1002,-0.9576767235994339

The increase in tax collected at source on money sent abroad and the inclusion of amounts spent overseas using international credit cards in the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) are steps taken to expand the tax base, according to a member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister.

According to the EAC-PM member, who asked not to be identified, when the tax collected at source (TCS) was lower, those who did not file income tax returns and those who did not declare their full income could not claim credit.

With the increase in the TCS rate to 20 percent, which blocks a substantially higher amount of funds, it could prod those who have not been declaring their full income to claim credit, the member said.

The government has been trying to widen the tax base in a country where less than 7 percent of the 1.3 billion population pay income tax. It started a slew of schemes to nudge Indians to declare their income, including the seeding of Permanent Account Numbers with bank accounts.

The government said in a notification dated May 16 that it had removed the exemption on the use of international credit cards from the LRS for payments made to meet expenses while on a visit outside India. Any spending above the LRS limit of $250,000 annually needs prior approval of the Reserve Bank of India.

The government will also increase the TCS rate on certain remittances covered under LRS, as envisioned in the Finance Act of 2023, with effect from July 1. Remittances for education and medical treatment will be exempt from the new 20 percent rate.

“The payment of TCS is not a final tax,” the finance ministry said in a note. “If the TCS payee is a taxpayer, he can claim credit for the TCS as his tax payment against regular income and adjust it against advance tax payments.”

The finance ministry said that if the TCS is of a person who is not a taxpayer, then the 20 percent rate on such presumed income is not high.

According to estimates by the MHA (Bureau of Immigration) and Ministry of Health, about 15 million Indians travel overseas and 100,000 Indians take treatment abroad every year. An estimated 1.2 million Indian students study in foreign universities and colleges.

Indians are spending more than ever on foreign travel. In January, Indians spent about $1.49 billion on foreign travel, a 50 percent increase from January 2022. RBI data shows Indians spent $11.4 billion so far this financial year.

Outflows under the LRS were at $19.61 billion in FY22. According to the EAC-PM member, if this includes even a fraction of individuals who are not declaring their income and the move prompts them to declare their actual income to claim credits, it could add a few thousand crore rupees to the government’s revenue.

Regressive move

Former key bureaucrats slammed the decisions, saying that a major part of LRS goes towards gifts, education and tourism overseas and such a move would only create problems in ease of living.

“It hurts middle-class India. For the middle-class father who borrows money for his children’s education, only the loan is exempt, not other expenses for which parents end up sending money,” said a former bureaucrat.

Another former bureaucrat said this is an attempt to conserve foreign exchange and would discourage people from transferring funds, but neither is a valid objective.

According to experts, when there is a need to increase domestic expenditure, the government is locking away the money of taxpayers in the hope of tracking down some errant individuals.",631,-0.4734097917874654

However, they may need to relook their travel budget soon. A recent amendment to the Foreign Exchange Management rules (FEM (CAT) Rules, 2000) is all set to play spoilsport, particularly if you are using your credit cards for overseas spends.

All international transactions by individuals using credit cards when outside India have been brought under the RBI’s Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS), which permits Indian residents to send up to $250,000 in a financial year abroad, without prior approval from the central bank. This has come into effect from May 16, 2023, as per a notification by the Ministry of Finance in the Gazette of India.

And by extension, such spends beyond a transaction value of Rs 7 lakh will now come under 5 percent tax collected at source (TCS). This rate is applicable only up to June 30, 2023. From July 1, 2023, these credit card transactions will attract a higher TCS rate of 20 percent. The Ministry of Finance in a release last night clarified that international spends of up to Rs 7 lakh by individuals on credit cards or debit cards will continue to be exempt from TCS even after June 30, 2023.

On the purchase of overseas tour packages, currently, a TCS of 5 percent is levied. From July 1, 2023, this will be hiked to 20 percent. Gautum Nayak, Partner, CNK & Associates LLP says that TCS is applicable whether the payment for the tour package is made in Indian rupees or not.

According to Sumanta Mandal, Founder TechnoFino if you make a holiday booking via an Indian travel agency, the latter will pass on the TCS-related extra cash outflow to the customer. In simple words, your travel agent will pay it on your behalf but will bill you for the TCS in your travel bill. Your PAN will be mentioned along with the booking and you will be able to claim TCS credit at the time of filing your tax returns.

So those planning summer trips to Europe will have to rejig their travel budgets. While you can always claim a refund on this TCS amount at the time of filing returns, you will have to shell out higher upfront costs initially.

As regards international transactions via credit cards, while one is in India, these are already covered under the LRS according to Nayak.

Brace up for higher upfront international travel costs

Simply put, the latest amendment means that you will have to set aside an additional 20 percent of your intended foreign remittance amount – meant to pay for travel and shopping expenses abroad, for instance – from July 1, 2023.

Unlike TDS (tax deducted at source) which gets levied on income (salary, interest income etc.), TCS gets deducted on certain expenses – with the tax authority intending to keep track of them. The TCS deducted can be claimed only at the time of filing your income tax returns. But until then, this money is blocked.

Taking the example of international travel, Parijat Garg, a digital lending consultant says, “Assuming a spend of Rs 1 lakh per passenger, for a typical family of 4, this may mean blocking nearly Rs 80,000 (Rs 20,000 per person) for 9-12 months. This would put more budgetary pressure on middle class families aspiring to travel abroad for holidays.”

Credit cards in the LRS net to track spends

Most tax consultants feel that the hike in TCS rate (introduced in Budget 2023) is a harsh move. “LRS is applicable to individuals only. Salaried employees already pay TDS. Business income and professional income is also subject to TDS. Then in addition, one has to pay TCS at 20 percent,” says Neeraj Agarwala, Director, Nangia Andersen India. He feels, if the tax authorities wanted to monitor transactions then 1 percent TCS would have been sufficient.

When the Finance Bill 2023 was passed, there was confusion on whether international transactions done via credit card transactions would attract TCS or not. “The amendment to the FEMA rules has eliminated this confusion. TCS will now be levied on all international transactions using credit cards just as it is for transactions through debit cards and forex cards, bank transfers or any other channel,” says Mandal.

Some industry players feel inclusion of credit cards under LRS was long overdue. Sudarshan Motwani, Founder & CEO, BookMyForex.com says, ""Debit and credit cards are becoming common methods for payments to merchants, booking of international hotels and holidays, etc., and hence control over LRS without the inclusion of credit cards was not possible.”

How to claim TCS

To claim TCS, you will need a TCS certificate provided by the collector or deductor at the time of deduction. This certificate can be used during your income tax return filing process to claim the TCS credit. While filing income tax returns, provide the TCS details in the appropriate section of the tax return form. This typically includes the TCS amount, the TCS certificate number, and other relevant information.

The taxpayer can claim the TCS credit against their total tax liability, that is, tax payable. The TCS credit reduces the overall tax liability or can be refunded if the TCS amount exceeds the tax liability.

Remember, the deductor is responsible for issuing TCS certificates, to the taxpayer. These certificates contain details of the TCS amount collected. Once you receive the certificate, verify the details carefully to ensure the accuracy of the TCS amount reported. Any discrepancies should be resolved with the deductor. If there are discrepancies or mismatches, it may require additional effort to rectify the details and claim the correct TCS credit.

To ensure a smoother process of adjusting TCS while filing income tax returns, it is advisable to maintain clear communication with the deductor, keep records of TCS certificates and other relevant documents, and seek professional advice if needed. Being proactive in resolving any discrepancies or issues can help streamline the process of getting a refund

The operational process of how this TCS will be charged on credit card spends is still unclear says Gupta. He further points out that cancellations, refunds, cashback in a forex transaction may lead to more tax-related disputes, unless managed with deft use of technology. According to Agarwala, the TCS could possibly reflect in your credit card statement as an additional charge on your international spends (which are shown under a separate head from domestic credit card spends).

Limited options to save on TCS outgo

According to Garg, with all banking transactions, whether done through a credit card or debit card or any other means getting covered under LRS, one cannot seemingly avoid the TCS impact.

While the government’s objective is to improve tax compliance, some tax experts are concerned that the stringent rules and higher rate could, in fact, backfire. “The new rule may encourage people to circumvent the rules by asking their friends and family members living abroad to make payments on their behalf and then be reimbursed by transfers to their Indian bank accounts,” says an expert who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",1188,-0.4509439468383789

Indian startups and businesses that allow their employees to use corporate credit cards for international payments are staring at a long compliance process and a possible short-term cash flow crunch amid the Central Government’s new amendment to deduct Tax Collected at Source (TCS) of 20 percent on international credit card transactions.

“There will definitely be an immediate cashflow impact. This is not a new levy, TCS was at 5 percent and now it is 20 percent. The only problem is the money will come back only after a year and this money is stuck till then. Even after applying for a refund, it will take some time,” said Ajay Rotti, CEO of Tax Compaas.

Startups and businesses generally allow employees to use corporate credit cards for business travel, international travel expenses, including accommodation and food and other foreign spending like subscriptions. These payments will usually be reimbursed by the companies after collecting the bills and transaction invoices.

“The question that should be asked now is whether international projects that Indian companies undertake will get costlier… Many companies’ cost of compliance is going to go up,” said another chartered accountant on the condition of anonymity.

While this is not a final tax liability it might create a short-term working capital issue of the TCS money getting parked with the government for more than a year.

“Imagine you are building software or providing an international service out of India as an individual. Your input costs are foreign software and services. TCS kills your business completely,” said Suhas Baliga, entrepreneur and a corporate lawyer wrote on Twitter on May 18.

The Finance Ministry recently amended rules under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) to bring international credit card spending under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS).

This means that credit card spending in a foreign currency will now be a part of LRS's annual limit of $2,50,000 per person, per year. Further, it will be subject to tax collected at source (TCS) of 20 per cent.

Before the Union Budget 2023, TCS under the LRS was at 5 per cent for remittances that exceeded Rs 7 lakh. However, with the new hike of 20 percent everyone will have to pay this amount, except those engaging in transactions related to medical treatment or education.

Corporate card expenses

Startups across sectors use corporate credit cards both under the companies' Permanent Account Number and Employees’ Permanent Account Number for business spending.

“Only a couple of startups reimburse the international office spends along with Tax payments, otherwise it is only the expenses excluding the TCS… We will have to claim the TCS at the end of the financial year. This is if the card is in the employee’s name,” said a marketing head of a top SaaS firm on the condition of anonymity.

“Some companies do reimburse along with TCS, however many don’t. I guess one possible solution is to go to the bank and change the corporate credit card under your (employee’s) name to the company’s name so TCS will be deducted only for the company,” said Deepak Shenoy Founder and CEO of CapitalMind while addressing queries on the topic at a Twitter Spaces.

Companies will have to make a policy soon if the proposal turns into a rule, Shenoy added.

Cumbersome compliance process ahead

While TCS can be claimed at the end of the financial year, experts believe there will be cumbersome compliance processes.

“The compliance process is going to get cumbersome… there are many employees travelling, the refund should be tracked, whether the employee applied for a refund should be tracked and much more and if companies do away with credit cards and give a cheque then that will be a long process too,” Rotti, a tax expert, said.

Banks and fintechs handling corporate credit cards will also have to bear the increased cost of compliance to provide transaction and refund details to companies.

More clarity is needed on business subscriptions

Subscriptions that are undertaken by startups will not attract TCS, however, an individual employee using it will have to pay TCS and claim a refund at the end of the financial year.

“Whether subscriptions or purchases by companies through like an Amazon US or a Dropbox subscription is chargeable or not is unclear. It depends on whether it comes under LRS, according to me it doesn’t attract TCS if a company undertakes it,” Rotti of Tax Compass said.

However, an individual employee who subscribes to any international software service for professional use using credit cards may face an issue.

“It is not like the credit card transactions for forex payments were cheaper there is also tax, forex charges, etc it just didn’t fall under LRS… I think subscriptions under individual’s names, which we used to get reimbursed will be affected,” said a startup founder on the condition of anonymity.

Startups exploring ways of transferring money through GIFT-City

“If the government has decided to tax the mode of payment or mode of transfer is not a bar at all. And GIFT-city is not a viable option anyway,” said a startup founder.

“The whole point of this move is that the government wants to make sure the credit card users are not exceeding the LRS limit… So, if this is the intent I don’t think any other workaround is possible,” Rotti said.

Rotti also added that while UPI transactions on TCS rules are still unclear, the penetration is restricted so far to only Singapore and Dubai.

Several founders and investors are awaiting more clarity on the proposed rule.

""The finance experts I have spoken to say that bringing international credit card spending outside India under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) is only applicable to those spends made abroad for travel and related transactions. This should not affect some SaaS startups… However, it would be good if the government can clarify this,” said Arvind Parthiban, CEO and co-founder of SaaS firm SuperOps.",1010,-0.813762104511261

Infosys’ average variable payout for Q4FY23 has been reduced to 60 percent at an organisation level, a sign of the increasing stress on the IT industry in an increasingly uncertain macro environment particularly in the company’s key markets, and the impact of the banking contagion in the fourth quarter.

The payout will be given along with the salary for May. While the average payout is 60 percent, an employee’s final variable payout will depend on their unit or department’s guidelines, and varies for different pay grades and departments.

In Q1FY23, Infosys had lowered variable payout to 70 percent, which was then reduced to 65 percent in Q2.

“While FY23 was a year of strong performance overall, the quarter that went by was impacted by a volatile market and unforeseen events,” an email sent to employees, as seen by Moneycontrol, said.

The company said in its email to employees that it must remain vigilant to changes in the market, and must see the current climate as an opportunity to “rally as a group and remain committed to navigating the changing business landscape”.

“We have always been a resilient organization, responding to market disruptions effectively and striving to move ahead,” it told employees.

Queries sent to Infosys were unanswered till the time of publishing.

Infosys had missed its guidance for the year in revenue growth after it reported the numbers for Q4, posting a full-year growth of 15.4 percent when its guidance was at 16-16.5 percent. Revenue in Q4FY23 came in at $4,554 million, a decline of 2.2 percent in reported terms and 3.2 percent in constant currency terms.

The IT major has guided for revenue growth of 4-7 percent in FY24, making this the first time since FY18 the company’s revenue will be in this guided range.

Infosys had said there was a one-time impact on revenue due to volume, but was also “a combination of cancellations and specific client issues”.

A software development engineer has revealed how he found a new job with a salary hike after being laid off from Amazon earlier this year. Arideep Dutta was one of the 18,000 Amazon employees across the world who lost their jobs in January after the e-commerce giant announced a major workforce reduction to cut costs.

In a recent interview with podcaster Riddhi Dutta, Arideep said that he was mentally prepared about being laid off, but the news still came as a blow. He credited the time he spent strategizing and preparing for interviews for helping him land a good job.

After being laid off from Amazon, Arideep said he took a short break to attend a cousin’s wedding before coming back to Bengaluru to start his job hunt. “After coming back from my cousin’s wedding, the first two weeks I spent preparing a strategy” for job application, said the former Amazon employee.

Arideep, who spent a year at TCS before joining Amazon, said that he shared news of his layoff on LinkedIn and received some interview offers. He also applied to several companies, confessing that firms tried to ‘lowball’ him when they realised he had been laid off.

“Companies will take advantage of that,” he said. “They will definitely ask for competing offer letters.”

Despite this, Arideep was clear from the get-go that the company hiring him would have to either match the salary he received at Amazon or offer him a pay hike. He said he received multiple offers from startups as well as established names like Flipkart.

“Yes, I was laid off from Amazon, my dream company. After that the journey to get next offer was a roler coster ride for me. And at last I ended having multiple offers from various PBCs like Flipkart, Nutanix, etc. with a 30-40% hike even in this recession,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post shared yesterday.

Arideep closed the podcast with a few words about the current job market and some advice for freshers. “In the current scenario, there is no guarantee you won’t be laid off. If Google, Microsoft, Amazon can carry out layoffs, you can’t expect anything from any other company,” he opined.

“If you are joining a startup, do some research – who are the investors of the startup? What stage is the startup? What are the future goals of the company?” he advised. “By doing this research, you can get to know whether the company is safe to join or not.”",438,0.6731483936309814

A perfect cocktail of foreign and domestic flows, coupled with attractive valuations, and a pretty earnings picture, can propel the markets to new highs. The first two of these three ingredients are in place at the moment. The third one – the earnings picture – is blinking red.

Let’s dial the clock back. In September 2022, the Nifty hit a low of 16,747 and started its upmove. It hit the 18,300 mark on November 11, before touching an all-time high of 18,887.

At the time, the July-September quarter earnings were in full swing. Robust credit growth was driving the financial sector story, and IT companies were showing no signs of a slowdown. Consumer companies were basking in the glory of price hikes.

HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, HCL Tech, Tata Consultancy Services and ITC, as well as the industrials and energy space, powered by the government’s capex push, all participated in the rally.

The earnings story was powering the index. The price-to-earnings (PE) ratio for Nifty was 15 percent higher than its long-term average. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) had sold over $18 billion in equities in the first 10 months of 2022, with nervousness about rising Fed rates looming large, triggering a run towards safety (read the dollar). But, domestic investors were still betting big on the earnings story.

At record high flows of over $35 billion, domestic flows were ‘more meaningful than FII flows’ was Credit Suisse’s verdict.

What is different now?

The tide is turning now. With Fed rates perceived to be peaking by a majority of market participants, risk-on trade is back. And India, meanwhile, is looking well poised to take a fair share of the foreign money that is flowing back to emerging markets.

Currently, the Nifty is slightly below its long-term average. “Nifty trades at ~18x one-year forward P/E, which is at an 8 percent discount to the long-term average of 20x. This is a decent drop from the level of 21x, seen at the beginning of FY23,” Siddharth Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.

Valuation premiums to both the emerging and world markets have also shrunk by a fourth since October, making it an opportune time for foreign investors to buy into India again. That’s exactly what the trend has been. FIIs have bought shares worth $1.7 billion so far in May alone.

“The domestic market structure looks positive,” adds Khemka. But is it enough to sustain the momentum?

Looks unlikely. Inflow from domestic investors, which was earlier acting as a floor, has reversed. They have sold equities worth $485 million (~Rs 3,997 crore) in the last fortnight. Demat (dematerialised) account openings were at the lowest level since December 2020 with only 1.60 million accounts opened in April.

“FIIs are buying, DIIs are selling. Only when we see both groups buying for a consistent period of three or four months, we can start becoming bullish on Indian markets. The right word now would be ‘constructive’ instead of ‘bullish’,” Rahul Bhuskute, chief investment officer at Bharti AXA Life Insurance said.

What about earnings?

Most Nifty constituents recorded high double-digit EPS (earnings per share) growth in FY23, led by financials. The one sector that disappointed was metals. The rally came in 2022 but earnings did not.

It was a difficult time for the metals pack as a sharp rise in prices of raw materials, such as iron ore and fuel, as well as power expenses, dented their earnings significantly. But come 2023, the China reopening theme spurred another stock rally.

Foreign brokerages were quick to upgrade their ratings on metal stocks. “Weakening US and EU macro pose a risk to the global metal demand, but a potential improvement in China could provide an offset,” Jefferies said.

Analysts’ earnings estimates also reflect this optimism. JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Hindalco, which saw their EPS decline in FY23, could see EPS growth in FY24, as per current estimates.

But the fear of uncertainty is no stranger to markets. In April, China’s imports unexpectedly dropped 7.9 percent to $205 billion, raising concerns about a boost to global economy.

“Lingering US debt ceiling impasse, no clear signs of an uptick in Chinese consumption and slowdown concerns may continue to weigh on metal prices,” according to Ravindra Rao of Kotak Securities.

But metal stocks might be the least of the concerns when it comes to powering the index ahead. Metals and mining make for only 3 percent of the Nifty 50’s weightage.

Which sector matters the most?

It is the financials pack. It makes for more than 35 percent of the index. EPS growth for financials was a blockbuster in FY23 and the expectations for FY24 are also running though not as high as FY23.

Robust credit growth is all set to moderate, believe analysts. Nomura has projected credit growth at 10 percent in FY24 from 15 percent in FY23. It has cited diminishing levels of inflation, especially on the wholesale side which tends to lower working capital needs and an expected moderation in GDP growth to 5.3 percent in FY24 as the primary reasons for the lower bank credit growth.

Net interest margins (NIMs) are also set to come under pressure with the re-pricing of deposits kicking in.

According to Sunil Damania, chief investment officer at Marketsmojo, private capex will take a backseat in the coming months which will have a bigger impact on credit growth. “The IMF, as well as the World Bank, has declared that the world economy is going to slow down. Why would corporates put up capex at such a time,” he asks.

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Whole-Time Director KVS Manian also hinted at this during the bank’s earnings call. “Overall corporate credit growth in the banking system has not been very strong currently as the capacity creation is yet to pick up,” he said.

For now, financials continue to be at the steering wheel. Profits of the Nifty pack that have declared Q4 results so far have risen 10 percent year on year, fuelled by financials. Excluding the pack, profits would have declined 1 percent year on year, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Information Technology, which has the second-biggest weightage on the index, of 12 percent, has already put up a poor show and the EPS estimates for FY24 do not suggest any fireworks either, amidst project deferrals, cancellations and delayed ramp-ups.

A global banking crisis has come as a surprise for the IT pack. Infosys has guided for a slow FY24 and Tech Mahindra’s margins are already down to single digits.

Could things get worse? Analysts believe so.

Jefferies says cracks are beginning to appear, slightly ahead of the imminent US recession. “The entire IT pack is precariously placed,” as per the firm. It has trimmed FY24 and FY25 consensus EPS estimates by 1-6 percent and further downside risks remain.

Just like IT, the consumer pack – commanding about 10 percent weightage on the index – is also precariously placed. Pent-up demand has faded out, double-digit volume growth remains elusive and inflation has burnt a deep hole in pockets. Demand in rural India - which makes for 40-45 percent of FMCG companies' topline - remains weak. The rate of volume decline has moderated but it remains in the negative zone.

This sector is set to see the highest moderation in EPS growth, as per Bloomberg estimates. Even discretionary names, like Titan and Eicher Motors, which stand on the winning side of the K-shaped recovery, will see EPS growth moderate from 40-50 percent in FY23 to 20 percent level in FY24.

All things considered, there’s little to cheer about Nifty at 18,400. The bears have enough reasons to keep new highs in check and the bulls might have to wait longer.

2023-05-11 09:56:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/motilal-oswal-upbeat-on-tier-1-it-stocks-here-are-its-top-picks-10565481.html,"markets15

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Securities maintains a positive outlook on the information technology (IT) sector, which has been hammered lately on worries of a muted FY24, expecting earnings to recover in the second half of the current financial year.

In a report on May 11, Motilal Oswal analysts cited a promising long-term demand outlook, attractive valuations, and historically high payout yields as reasons for their optimism.

The median yield for FY24 and FY25 is estimated to be 4.2 percent and 4.9 percent, exceeding the 4 percent mark achieved in FY23 for the first time since FY18.

This indicates that companies within its “tier 1 coverage” have been delivering attractive returns to shareholders through dividends, potentially bolstering share prices.

The valuation of the tier-1 coverage has significantly corrected, down 21 percent YoY in FY23, leading to a 1-year forward price-earnings ratio of 17x, aligning with the 10-year average and substantially lower than the peak of 33x in 2021, the report said.

The market has already priced in the potential impact of the uncertain macro environment and demand slowdown, considering the positive prospects and advancements in technology adoption by businesses, the analysts said.

A good second half

While acknowledging a near-term growth slowdown due to macroeconomic pressures in key economies, Motilal anticipates an earnings recovery in the second half of FY24, accompanied by attractive payouts.

As a result, it prefers the “tier-1 pack” the over “tier-2”. The brokerage suggest a selective approach within the sector and view any correction in its preferred names as an opportunity to accumulate further.

TCS is its top pick and it also favours HCL Technology as well as Infosys within its tier-1 coverage. The choices are based on the firm’s analysis and assessment of market prospects, the report said.

The brokerage maintains a positive long-term outlook for the IT sector, highlighting attractive valuations, historically high payout yields, and the potential for an earnings recovery.

At around 9.40 am, the sectoral Nifty IT index was trading 0.65 percent higher to 28,275 points while the benchmark NIfty was down 0.12 percent at 18,293 points.

Returns matter a lot, yet there are always scenarios where analysts and investors are at odds. Sometimes analysts are gung-ho over a stock despite investors dumping it; there are also occasions when investors lap up a stock that analysts seem to loathe.

With the Indian market climbing higher in the past one month, a cluster of stocks has stood out prominently where investors and analysts are at a variance.

Contrarian downgrades

Bajaj Auto, despite a rally in its share price, has stood out like a sore thumb when it comes to analyst views, with the ‘buy’ recommendations decreasing to 27 in April, from 33 in the previous month and 40 in the past one quarter.

The shares of the largest domestic three-wheeler original equipment maker have risen 17 percent over a month, 12 percent over a quarter and 16 percent in a year.

Post the recent rally, Kotak Institutional Equities believes most of the positives are already baked in the current market price of Bajaj Auto, prompting it to maintain its ‘reduce’ rating on the automobile stock with a hike in target price to Rs 4,000 from Rs 3,625 earlier.

Besides this, a cut in export volumes and market share loss faced by the second-largest motorcycle manufacturer has led to the downgrades.

“Concerns on the export volumes continue (around 50 percent of sales) with Bajaj Auto delaying the recovery timelines led by uncertainty on unavailability of USD and lower affordability. Also, lack of market share gains in the domestic motorcycles market over the last few years, and increase in competition could lead to further pricing actions,” said brokerage house Prabhudas Lilladher.

Meanwhile, Jefferies slightly differed from the view. Even as the capital markets firm is concerned about Bajaj Auto's market share loss in premium bikes and exports, it sees multiple tailwinds—improving domestic demand, gradual export recovery, the launch of Triumph bikes, and the scale-up of EVs.

UltraTech Cement

Over the quarter, another stock that caught the eye was UltraTech Cement where ‘buy’ ratings dropped to 39 from 42 but the share price rose 12.5 percent during the same period.

Gains in the stock price were on the back of the cement manufacturer’s leadership position in the industry with a market share of around 26 percent in FY23, coupled with robust expansion plans without leveraging the balance sheet. Strong demand, cement prices likely remaining stable and power and fuel costs treading lower also supported the buying sentiment for the cement stock.

However, the only thing that seems to be ticking off analysts is the limited upside potential in the stock. Dolat Capital said that the current market price leaves limited upside.

At Rs 7,704 on the BSE, UltraTech Cement’s stock is about a percent away from scaling its 52-week high.

Coal India

Other stocks that analysts seem to dislike are Coal India and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories.

For Coal India, 7 brokerage firms have downgraded their ratings on the state-owned mining company’s stock to 15 ‘buy’ recommendations from 22 over the past one year. This is in contrast to the coal major’s near 23 percent rally in the share price, which was largely due to attractive valuation and high dividend yield. The company’s board gave in-principle approval to divest a 25 percent stake in Bharat Coking Coal and some analysts believe a stake sale along with a potential listing could help unlock value, which also triggered the rally.

At Rs 237, the stock trades at an inexpensive valuation of 3.9 times FY24 EV/EBITDA, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Among other things that made analysts wary is a likely fall in e-auction realisations. CLSA believes e-auction realisations will fall further on a decline in global prices.

Lower-than-expected e-auction realisation of Rs 4,525 per tonne, down 10 percent QoQ, played a spoilsport during the March quarter. Sharekhan by BNP Paribas highlighted that lower realisations, especially for e-auction, could affect margins and earnings outlook.

Dr Reddy’s Labs

As for Dr Reddy’s, ‘buy’ ratings have slipped to 31 from 37 over a year. Analysts take it that the ongoing United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) plant inspections and a few companies being issued Form 483 with observations pointing at apparent regulatory concerns, may drag the performance of pharmaceutical players, prompting them to stay selective in the space.

Recently, Dr Reddy’s has been issued a Form 483 with one observation by the US FDA following an inspection of the company’s active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing facility in Bollaram, Hyderabad.

Sharekhan cautioned that increased scrutiny from the US FDA, leading to production delays, and rising guidance around research and development and promotion and marketing costs in the near term, could act as headwinds against a potentially strong operating performance for the drugmaker.

Despite the downgrades, the scrip of the pharmaceutical major has shot up 20 percent during the past one year given the superior product portfolio and strong product pipeline of Dr Reddy’s.

Dr Reddy’s has outperformed the Nifty Pharma index over the past one year. The pharma major’s scrip has climbed 26 percent higher in comparison with the 0.5 percent drop in the index.

Contrarian upgrades

On the other hand, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) was the only stock on Nifty50 where the share price declined for over a month, yet analysts upgraded their ratings on the scrip.

Volume growth for India’s largest FMCG company seemed to be a worry for investors, which triggered a small drop in the stock price over the past one month, but analysts paid heed to the upbeat management commentary. The HUL’s management believes overall volume growth will likely recover gradually as consumption comes with a lag. It also reiterated that the rural slowdown has bottomed out and the company should start seeing volume recovery provided the macro environment and raw material prices remain stable.

What analysts also like about HUL — that houses brands like Lux, Pond’s, Red Label, Bru, Dove, Fair & Lovely, Horlicks, Kissan, Pepsodent, Surf Excel, and Vaseline — is the company’s continued market share gains in a challenging consumption environment and its focus on driving premiumisation across categories.

The company’s premium portfolio continues to significantly outperform both the market and HUL’s overall growth, pointed out ICICI Securities.

Besides HUL, analysts also have a fondness for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Wipro despite the negative stock trajectory over a quarter.

Tata Consultancy Services

Even as the stock price is down 6 percent, ‘buy’ calls on TCS shares have bumped up to 24 from 21.

The technology company reported robust deal Total Contract Value (TCV) wins with order book TCV of $10 billion as compared with $7.8 billion in Q3 FY23 and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 times recording an all-time high number of large deals, highlighted Sharekhan.

Meanwhile, PhillipCapital expects TCS to continue to command a valuation premium over its peers, on the back of its strong diversified profile, superior return profile (Return on Equity of 46 percent in FY23), management stability, strong margins and market leadership position.

Despite the strong deal pipeline, the TCS management indicated caution and uncertainty among clients in the near term, which could further impact revenues as well as slow down margin improvement.

Sharekhan has cautioned that the near-term outperformance would be restricted for TCS owing to uncertain earnings outlook, CEO transition and global macro headwinds.

Wipro

Meanwhile, Wipro has also seen an increase in upgrades over a quarter with ‘buy’ recommendations topping up to 13 from 11 despite a 3 percent drop in share price.

Besides, the pricey stock valuation, March quarter earnings had made investors cautious, yet the announcement of buying back shares worth Rs 12,000 crore looked like the saving grace.

“At 15X FY2025E EPS, the stock is not yet cheap enough to warrant a re-look. The stock may hold up in the short term courtesy of buyback,” said Kotak Institutional Equities.

Multiple analysts believe that the current stock valuation fairly captures the risk from the slowing macroeconomic environment that Wipro is facing along with lower-than-expected revenue growth. Wipro has guided for a sequential decline of 1-3 percent in revenue in 1Q FY24, essentially implying no growth in FY24.

Reliance Industries

Over a year, a contrarian upgrade that stole the show is Reliance Industries which saw brokerage firms stepping up their ‘buy’ calls to 33 from 26. Much of the optimism among analysts for RIL’s stock stems from the likelihood of Jio and retail business listings. However, the share price of the oil-to-telecom conglomerate has slumped 14 percent over a year.

CLSA explained that a lack of launches and growth areas has kept the stock subdued over the past 18 months. This, according to the foreign brokerage firm, could change in the second half of FY24 as it sees the Mukesh Ambani-led company start offering its portable 5G device (Jio Airfiber) to ramp up wireless broadband additions and launch its affordable 5G smartphone as it monetises its pan-India standalone 5G launch by end-2023. Further, recent brand launches (Independence, Campa Cola) suggest could ramp up Reliance’s FMCG foray in 2023.

Most importantly, CLSA highlighted in its research report in March that with three years having passed since the stake sale to PE investors, it sees a good chance of a Jio and/or retail IPO in the next 12 months.

Bajaj Finance

Another stock that put the others in the shade was Bajaj Finance. The financier’s stock saw ‘buy’ calls spiralling up to 24 from 19.

The management has guided for healthy loan growth going forward aided by healthy demand as well as new segments, while some fall in net interest margins will be compensated by operating efficiencies. Hence, according to Jefferies, earnings growth and ROA (Return On Asset) can stay high which will support the stock valuations.

“It is also awaiting RBI's approval to foray into credit cards, which we believe can add 5-10 percent to profit pool opportunity,” the global investment banking firm said.

Despite the liking, investors sold the stock over a year with the share price declining around 7 percent during the period. The stock had been consolidating for the last one year.

Some market participants have expressed concern that the lagged effect of rate hikes will likely temper margins. Besides, Kotak Institutional Equities believes the overall business outlook remains strong although rich valuations cap any upside in the stock.

With the apprehension of a slowdown in earnings deepening since three US banks came crashing down and the fear of a recession intensified, foreign investors began pulling out of top Indian IT companies.

Foreign investors reduced its stake in Infosys, India’s second largest software services firm, to 43.08 percent from 44.57 percent in the sixth straight quarter of divestment, according to latest shareholding pattern. FII holding in the country's largest software exporter, Tata Consultancy Services, was down to 12.72 percent in the March quarter from 12.94 percent in the tenth consecutive quarter of sell-off.

Other IT companies such as Tata Elxsi Ltd, Tech Mahindra Ltd, Zensar Technologies, LTIMindtree, Mastek, Mphasis, L&T Technology Services Ltd, Birlasoft, and Affle India Ltd, too recorded a steady decline in FII stakes over the previous quarter. While the pull-out from tech Mahindra continued for nine quarters in a row, Affle India suffered the bleeding for seven quarters.

The divestment by foreign investors weighed heavy on the quarterly earnings of the country's top IT companies with TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Tech, and Tech Mahindra, reporting weak financials that fell short of market expectations. They also expressed a lack of confidence in the near-term outlook, leading to a significant decline in net additions for fiscal 2023. The slump could be attributed to the ongoing crisis in US regional and European banks, as well as an unfavorable macroeconomic environment.

The sell-off has been worst in the March quarter with foreign institutional investors (FIIs) withdrawing around Rs 7,978 crore from the information technology sector, according to NSDL data.

Wipro Ltd and HCL Technology, however, bucked the trend as they reported a spurt in foreign funds flow. After seven consecutive quarters of reducing their stake in Wipro, foreign investors returned to the company in the March quarter, raising their stake to 8.77 percent from 8.67 percent. For HCL Tech, the FII holding increased to 18.92 percent from 18.29 percent sequentially.

Global brokerage house BofA recently predicted that the earnings growth could be at risk due to the global economic slowdown, particularly affecting the IT sector. As a result, it has stated that IT remains its top underweight, indicating a negative outlook for the sector.

Brokerage house Citi has revised its preferred list and eliminated Infosys from it, following its negative outlook on the IT sector. Consequently, the firm's coverage has been downgraded to either sell or neutral in all areas. The brokerage house has marked IT services as underweight.",410,-0.7499823868274689

Information Technology companies such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro, and LTIMIndtree have declared a holiday for their offices in Karnataka on the day of polling for the state’s Assembly elections on May 10, the companies confirmed to Moneycontrol.

This is significant as the Election Commission of India (ECI) had declared a holiday on polling day to increase voter participation, and yet the ECI received complaints from employees in IT-BT companies about a holiday not being granted.

Bengaluru district election officer Tushar Girinath told Moneycontrol that if companies do not declare a paid holiday on May 10, their Chief Executive Officers will be prosecuted.

""All establishments are closed on May 10 to allow voters to vote anywhere in Karnataka. Any violation of this and a voter being denied the right by not giving him a paid holiday, the person will be liable to be prosecuted. We will prosecute the CEO of the company,"" Girinath said.

The state-wide paid holiday applies to all categories of employees including those working for the government, in public sector undertakings, banks, financial institutions, and private businesses.

The election is even being held on a Wednesday to push for higher voter turnout, as Bengaluru’s voter turnout is usually low. In fact, ECI records showed that IT clusters such as Bommanahalli, BTM Layout, KR Puram and CV Raman Nagar, coming under assembly constituencies, usually record low polling rates.

There is a polling percentage target of 65 percent for Bengaluru in this assembly election too by the Election Commission.

Karnataka will vote to elect legislators for 224 seats in the state Assembly, 28 of which are in Bengaluru, on May 10. Voting will take place from 7 am to 6 pm.

A hoax bomb threat at the campus of a top tech company in Hyderabad, reportedly TCS, on Thursday sent employees into a panic mode. Nearly 1,500 employees were evacuated from the premises following the threat that came in around 11 am, The Indian Express reported.

The call was allegedly made from Bengaluru by a former TCS employee who was removed from his job, early investigation revealed. The caller worked at the company’s security wing, according to The Indian Express.

The person, in their call, claimed that a bomb was planted in the premises of TCS in Hyderabad, the police said.

After being alerted by the IT firm, a police team from the city’s Madhapur, along with a bomb disposal squad, reached the spot and conducted a thorough search of the premises, but found nothing suspicious.

The person had initially called the company and informed about the bomb being planted at the building. The company received a call again, informing them that it was a hoax, the police said.

Indian Information Technology (IT) companies experienced a dismal last quarter in the financial year ended March 2023 as they coped with challenges ranging from recession fears and high inflation to ripples from a banking crisis in the West.

The top five IT companies did report double-digit revenue growth in constant currency terms for the full fiscal year 2023.

Even so, it’s anyone’s guess how long the impact of a recession in the US and Europe and the banking crisis that has laid low Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse will continue to take its toll on an IT services industry that depends on banking and financial services for a major chunk of sales.

If we were to look at hiring as an indicator of demand, it doesn’t look too promising. After the pandemic-fuelled demand of the previous year, India’s top five companies reported a 65 percent slump in net additions to their workforce in FY23.

According to HFS Research Chief Executive Officer Phil Fersht, 2023, too, will be challenging although the industry is holding up well. Times will get tougher, he says, because of pressure on margins and clients demanding pre-inflationary pricing.

“The winners will be those that can win deals with performance pricing baked in and less focus on people costs,” he says.

How they fared in FY23

FY23 had started on a positive note and everyone in the IT industry was preparing for high growth and digital deals. At the time, the only concerns were the supply-side challenges and the Russia-Ukraine war, according to Pareekh Jain, founder and CEO of EIIRTrend. These supply-side challenges too eased.

“But in H2FY23 the challenges started coming in, first with tech company layoffs and then in the latest quarter, tech and BFSI sectors got hit,” Jain said. BFSI stands for Banking, Financial Services and Insurance.

“Suddenly, there was oversupply in the market. All plans of hiring had to be stalled as more people were on the bench. And demand too started to subdue because of these banking and tech crises,” Jain said.

The fond hope had been that the fourth quarter of FY23 would be spared and the effects of the negatives would be visible only in FY24, but that wasn’t the case. At a time most segments of IT business were impacted, pockets such as engineering services did see growth, Jain said.

Ray Wang, CEO of Constellation Research, told Moneycontrol that despite the slowdown, IT services firms that can move the quickest will do the best.

Highlighting company-specific concerns, Wang said Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported its slowest revenue growth in 11 quarters, with a number of projects deferred to the new quarter.

Infosys reported weaker-than-expected Q4 numbers that missed analyst estimates and HCL Technologies, Wang said, showed “some sales finesse in winning 13 large deals.”

Wipro, Wang said, was “doing better with large deals and the horizontal realignment strategy to service cloud, data and analytics, bio, product engineering, infrastructure services and consulting.”

Tech Mahindra, which reported a drop from 12 percent in Q3 to 9.6 percent in Q4 margins, is in the midst of a crisis, Wang said.

“They have had a tough time retaining talent and keeping clients. The company really needs the big deal expertise of [CEO designate] Mohit [Joshi] as well as his diplomatic skill in working with clients and inspiring the staff,” he said.

In a tough spot

Leadership teams at all IT companies have sounded a note of caution, some more than others, as the stress becomes evident. Deal ramp downs have been seen across the board as well as delays in decision-making by clients.

Fersht told Moneycontrol: “We’re seeing customers aiming to slim down their providers massively. Some of these large deals (on vendor consolidation) are very resource-demanding, especially in the first couple of years. They can be very complex, and it’s hard to envisage exactly what’s needed during the RFP [request for proposal] process,” he said

.

Wang said that the macro conditions were part of a temporary three-to-six-month slowdown to pause general IT spending.

“However, projects that are related to optimisation, regulatory compliance and modernisation are still being prioritized. Pressure on Europe and APAC (Asia-Pacific) continues to hamper growth. Middle East remains a highlight along with the ANZA (Australia and New Zealand) and the Indian market. North America is slowing down, but continues to be a growth market,” Wang said.

Guidance for year ahead

Guidance by companies such as Infosys, Wipro and HCLTech hasn’t been promising. For FY24, Infosys has guided for revenue growth of 4-7 percent in constant currency. And HCLTech has guided for revenue growth of 6-8 percent in constant currency terms, down from 12-14 percent in FY23.

Wipro, on the other hand, which guides for the following quarter, has guided for a -3 to -1 percent decline in revenue in constant currency terms.

CEO Thierry Delaporte told the press that the macro environment remains challenging looking ahead. “Our clients, our industry, and many sectors are impacted by the prolonged uncertainty in the economic environment. These headwinds are impacting our business and projections as well,” he said.

CFO Jatin Dalal, on the other hand, had told analysts hopes are that growth picks up in the second half, but the environment is still uncertain.

Experts have differed on a likely pick-up in demand in the second half of the year.

Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities said its view is that “the worst on the macro front is ahead of us and not behind us, and hence we think a 2HFY24 recovery in growth seems quite unlikely.”

Digital journey

Kotak Institutional Equities took a different approach. While macro uncertainties and the banking crisis in the US have impacted client sentiment on tech spending, leading to limited visibility on near-term demand, digital transformation is an ongoing journey “with most enterprises still in early stages,” it said.

According to Kotak, depending on the client-specific situation and the outlook of the industry segment they operate in, client priorities on spending would differ.

“Clients in the impacted verticals and those focusing on survival would prioritize lowering their cost base. On the other hand, the set of clients focused on strengthening their competitive positioning vis-à-vis peers would look to continue spending on transformation programs,” it said.

“In addition, given the current uncertain macro scenario, enterprises might also favour to bundle upfront cost-takeout mandates, followed by transformation into larger engagement while also consolidating the set of vendors they work with,” Kotak added in a note.

According to HFS’ Fersht, increased focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation will take centre stage in FY24 and believes some ambitious mid-sized providers can fare well because they can be nimble.

“The Tier 1s have to be wary of large vendor consolidation deals that could prove unprofitable and resource-draining,” he said. According to him, these mega deals created “huge resource headaches for service providers in many ways.”

Wang concurs on the AI front and says automation and AI were working hand-in-hand.

Reducing human interaction

“Every customer is finding ways to automate and reduce human interaction and also find exponential opportunities with AI,” he said. The focus is on contract negotiations, cloud optimization, code refactoring, and in some cases a move back to on-premises workloads.

“Customers are asking vendors to renegotiate deals with software vendors and services firms. A focus is on consolidating software vendors and optimizing overall IT service spend,” he said.

On the way forward, Wang says we can expect the slowdown to continue for the first two quarters, before picking up in late Q3. “Companies have many projects in cloud, analytics, automation, AI, and cybersecurity that must be completed in order to achieve operational efficiency and exponential growth,” he said.

UnearthInsight founder Gaurav Vasu says that in FY24, deal wins in areas such as cloud transformation, digital transformation and AI and verticals such as pharma, healthcare and life sciences will continue.

“We will still continue to see a few large deals. In FY24, a lot of deal renewals are coming up. These renewals will be a big push for the industry. You will see selective large companies offering end-to-end solutions will continue to win large deals. But overall, in FY24 and Q1FY25, deals will mostly be small. Weakness in BFSI will continue for some time. Growth overall in FY24 will be slower,” Vasu said.

Supply-side

The dwindling net headcount addition numbers have already given an indication of the times to come. Analysts expect hiring to be under pressure.

Vasu says that both gross hiring and net headcount additions are expected to return to their pre-pandemic levels.

He anticipates that companies will go back to pre-pandemic behaviour of internally rotating and fulfilling roles.

“New tech-skills-based roles will require backfilling and new hiring. For some of the companies, given the huge hikes being paid out to new employees and large scale hiring, employee cost was about 65-70 percent of the wage bills of some of the IT companies; that’s getting normalised,” he said.

In FY24, he added, IT services companies will look to normalise the big cost element and look to quality hiring.

“We estimate the IT services industry will hire close to 8,00,000-9,00,000 on a gross basis and the entire industry will hire between 2,00,000-2,12,000 people in FY24,” he said.

According to Unearthinsight, in FY23, the gross hiring that also included people jumping from one company to another was around 7,50,000 to 9,00,000.",1584,-0.4682135664754444

In simple terms, AI is the ability of machines to perform certain tasks like translating languages, analysing data (text, audio, video, code, etc), etc., somewhat like human beings but at a larger scale. Generative AI, specifically, refers to producing new content, code, synthetic data, etc., either automatically (based on a programme, e.g.) or based on a prompt (text or image, e.g.) given by the user.

Unlike the unrealised potential of the metaverse, senior industry executives told Moneycontrol that AI has gone beyond the exploratory stages . In fact, in a challenging macro-environment where the focus is shifting to cost efficiency, companies like Tech Mahindra are helping clients save millions by integrating existing AI tools in their operations, as well as building new solutions.

NG Subramaniam, Chief Operating Officer, TCS, mentioned during the company’s earnings call that generative AI was already a revenue-generating vertical. He said, ""In my interactions with clients over the last quarter, the conversation starts and stops with ChatGPT and what it's going to do.”

Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said that his company has active projects that use generative AI platforms to address specific areas of the client’s business.

“We have trained open-source generative AI platforms on our internal software development libraries. We expect generative AI to provide more opportunities to work with our clients, and also to help us improve our own productivity,” he said.

As for Accenture, its plan to expand AI and data capabilities included acquiring Bengaluru-based industrial AI company Flutura in March.

“We are acquiring Flutura to strengthen our industrial AI services, and to improve the performance of plants, refineries, and supply chains of our clients in the energy, chemicals, metals, mining, and pharmaceutical industries. It will also enable our clients to achieve their net zero goals faster,” Pranav Arora, MD and Lead – Applied Intelligence, Accenture India, told Moneycontrol.

“By ushering in a new era of enterprise intelligence, generative AI has the potential to transform business tasks and functions, from customer service and knowledge management, to creative production and scientific research, across virtually every industry,” Arora added.

These IT companies are already partnering with Google, Microsoft, and Microsoft-backed OpenAI (which developed ChatGPT), as the battle to gain market share for deploying generative AI solutions globally intensifies.

Many of the abovementioned IT firms are engaged in building and customising enterprise level solutions using the tools offered by these tech giants.

What’s in the offing?

TCS is currently working on both the solutions and the consulting front. The solutions include AI-powered financial advisory and wealth management solutions for the BFSI sector, a virtual fashion designer for the retail industry, computer vision for heavy industries, and AI-driven streaming data analytics for anomaly detection, among others.

Nidhi Srivastava, Vice President and Global Head of Google Business Unit, TCS, which is working on developing AI solutions on top of Google’s tools, said, “We are also exploring cross-industry solutions to enhance productivity through automated code generation, content creation, copywriting, and marketing.”

On the services side, TCS is building service offerings and delivery capabilities that can accelerate the implementation of AI-based solutions for clients. “We have also created an `AI Factory‘ to expand AI adoption in enterprises,” Srivastava said.

For Wipro, it’s been over two years since it established the Generative AI Centre of Excellence (CoE) to work with technology partners and academic institutions driving research in advanced areas of AI.

Mukund Kalmanker, VP & Global Head, AI Solutions, Wipro, told Moneycontrol, “Wipro is engaged in many client conversations ranging from AI-assisted decision making to designing new-age digital experiences, to transforming processes across business functions and modernising IT systems and infrastructure.”

He added that customers from sectors like banking, insurance, energy, retail, consumer goods, life sciences, healthcare, telecom, etc., are interested in leveraging AI.

Tech Mahindra too is working on many projects and developing solutions in the AI and Intelligent Automation (IA) space. It is assisting enterprises in meeting demand and improving efficiency.

Kunal Purohit, Chief Digital Services Officer, Tech Mahindra, said, “We help enterprises save millions with computer vision-based asset inspection solutions, crowdsourcing (data, etc.), conversational AI, anomaly detection, Document AI or low-code/no-code solutions like Vision AI Workbench, Forecasting Workbench, etc.”

For instance, using their Smart Assistant solution that classifies all incoming email, Tech Mahindra improved data accuracy by 90 percent and reduced human effort by 60 percent for an insurance claims company, delivering a 6X increase in the ROI on support cost, Purohit said.

How top IT firms are leveraging generative AI

Need for AI talent

AI is becoming an essential part of digital transformation strategies for businesses across industries, and it will continue to evolve and become more accessible, according to Purohit. To capture this opportunity, IT companies will need reliable and skilled talent to develop solutions.

Wipro’s Kalmanker said the company has a robust enterprise-wide AI talent management plan in place, which includes both hiring talent as well as a well-developed AI curriculum to train employees at the Wipro AI Academy.

“Our approach also includes scholarships for Ph. Ds at globally renowned academic institutions. These are for research programmes that attempt to solve complex business problems through innovations in generative AI,” he added.

According to Srivastava, there will be a big demand for AI talent across levels including strategists, solution architects, implementation specialists, model developers, model trainers, training data preparers, and end-to-end ML (machine learning) lifecycle specialists, to name a few.

“While hiring will be a channel for talent acquisition, there will be equal, if not more focus on talent up-skilling and cross-skilling. This will help retain contextual organisational knowledge while ensuring viable labour economics,” Srivastava said, speaking of TCS’ plans.

Concerns on privacy and cyber security

Companies like TCS are also exploring the use of generative AI to assist their own employees, though cyber security risks remain a concern.

In an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol, TCS CHRO Milind Lakkad had said, “We are looking into what generative AI means in the context of an enterprise, not just from the standpoint of what the operating model will be, but also what will be the role of an employee versus the role of an AI co-worker.”

He had added that with generative AI being used, there are also discussions underway about safeguarding intellectual property (IP), security, etc. With AI bots like ChatGPT, there are concerns about the code (the IP) getting leaked when auto-generating code, or malicious code getting created.

“With new tools come new concerns and security risks. High on the list of concerns for cybersecurity practitioners is the possibility that ChatGPT could be used to generate malicious code. This means many more people could create malware, potentially leading to many more attacks and breaches,” Infosys said in a blog post.

While there is demand for generative AI-based solutions, companies are also worried about its implications. This has already led some firms to regulate its use, or ban the technology entirely.

Firms like Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo have banned ChatGPT across their offices globally.",1243,0.20020100673039753

India's top five IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra — added 83,906 employees in FY23, a 69 percent decline from the previous year's addition of 2,73,377 employees. Among the five companies, only HCLTech added new employees in each quarter of the fiscal year. The earnings season was lackluster, with mixed or muted results and cautious outlooks for the next quarter, given the prevailing macroeconomic conditions.

Net additions and hiring are indicators of demand. However, companies say that their utilisation is low and attrition is falling, which suggests that they have room to grow and do not need to hire as aggressively.

TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra have all experienced net headcount reductions during one of the quarters. Wipro and Tech Mahindra have both seen a reduction in headcount for two consecutive quarters – in Q3 and Q4.

According to company executives, the talent market is cooling down and returning to where they were prior to the pandemic years. FY22, in particular, has been termed as an aberration when it comes to net addition, and experts say companies will move closer to their net addition levels pre-pandemic. This is already starting to show up, as FY23's net addition figure is closer to that of FY21's net addition of 86,685 employees.

Hiring was on a tear as a result of pandemic-induced demand, with a large number of freshers hired as well. Now, those numbers are being staggered for onboarding, but due to declining utilisation, some companies haven't committed to hiring numbers for Q4.

Tech Mahindra saw the steepest drop in headcount addition for the year, adding only 1,227 employees on a net basis, compared to 30,119 net additions last year. The company added 6,862 employees in Q1, 5,877 in Q2, went into the red by 6,844 employees in Q3, and saw another consecutive decline of 4,688 employees in Q4.

At the same time, the company has the lowest attrition rate among its peers, at 15 percent.

Harshvendra Soin, the company’s Chief Human Resources Officer, told analysts after the results on April 27 that the company’s internal fulfillment rates have increased substantially.

“Our focus is on upskilling, giving opportunities from within, and it has really worked out. Add to this the fact that our attrition is also the lowest among our peer set gives us a lot of confidence tha the strategy is working and folks are getting more opportunities internally so we don’t have to go out every single time,” he said.

Wipro is the other company that has seen a negative headcount reduction for two consecutive quarters. Speaking to the press on April 27, Chief Executive Officer Thierry Delaporte attributed the headcount decline in Q3 and Q4 to the large addition the company made in the first quarter of the fiscal — 15,446 employees on a net basis. (This fell to 605 in Q2, saw a decline of 435 in Q3 and another decline of 1,832 employees in Q4).

Delaporte said that high addition in Q1, lowering utilisation and impacting margins, was done knowing that the company would need them in later quarters. These people, he said, are being trained, onboarded and deployed.

“If you look at the evolution of the headcount, in a given quarter, you might not necessarily see this impact. The reality is that we will continue to hire, there is demand, we are growing in some areas, on some specific skills, where there's very high demand, and we need to continue to hire. At the same time, attrition is going down, so we need to take into that account. Finally, the fact that with our level of utilisation — which has improved over last few quarter — we see also that there's some room for improvement,” he said.

Wipro added 22,000 freshers during the year, which it said was the highest it has done so far.

Infosys, Wipro’s cross-town rival, saw a headcount decline of 3,611 during the last quarter of FY23. Its headcount addition for the year also fell along with attrition. It added 29,219 employees on a net basis in FY23, down from FY22’s 54,396. The company hired 51,000 freshers during the year. While it usually gives a target number for hiring for the year ahead, it did not do so this time.

During the company’s earnings press conference, Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy said that the softness in demand is what led to utilisation falling to 80 percent, and it expects this to increase gradually in coming quarters.

“We will calibrate the hiring for FY24 based on the available pool of employees, growth expectations and attrition trends.” He added that they have a lot of people on the bench as well. “I think our model in terms of hiring has got enough flexibility to take care of new volumes. In any case, we have a rich bench, 80 percent utilisation is what we have, and usually, we have operated well above that,” he said.

Kotak Institutional Equities had said in its note that the headcount addition for FY24 could be tepid due to “limited demand visibility, significant headroom on utilisation, moderating lateral attrition and trainees becoming billable”.

HCLTech's net headcount dropped from 39,900 to 17,067 over the year, but it did manage to add employees each quarter, including over 25,000 freshers. “While we are scaling fresher intake, we still have an opportunity here. We will have sustained focus on this over the next two to three years to improve this further,” Chief Executive Officer C Vijayakumar said.

In FY24, the company targets to add 15,000 freshers which will be higher than the gross addition.

Lastly, TCS, which kicked off the earnings season, saw a marginal increase of 821 employees in Q4, following a reduction in headcount in Q3. Attrition has moderated to 20.1 percent as of Q4FY23, and it has been declining from peak levels. During FY23, the company added 44,000 freshers as well as their “highest ever number of experienced professionals during the year,” according to CHRO Milind Lakkad.

Apart from HCLTech, TCS is the only company that has stated how many freshers it plans to hire in FY24, having rolled out 46,000 offers.",1037,0.07620202553899665

IT major Wipro has witnessed a decline in its headcount for the second quarter. The company ended the fourth quarter of the 2023 fiscal year with 1,823 fewer employees than the previous quarter. In contrast, during the same period last year, it had added 11,457 employees. The previous quarter, ending in December 2022, also saw a reduction of 435 employees.

With this, the company’s net addition for FY23 stands at 13,793, down from FY22’s net addition of 45,416. The company’s total headcount now stands at 2,56,921.

Wipro previously saw a reduction in headcount for two quarters in the Covid quarters of Q4FY20 and Q1FY21.

Wipro had a strong net addition of 15,446 in the first quarter of the fiscal, which slipped to 605 in Q2. In Q3, the company saw its headcount decline by 435 employees, and now by 1,823.

Wipro is the last of the four IT heavyweights to report its results for the March quarter and the full year. All of them have reported significant declines in net addition for the full year, and TCS and Infosys for the fourth quarter as well. Infosys also saw a decline in headcount this quarter.

Net addition is an indicator of demand, but also comes at a time that supply-side challenges are abating the macroeconomic environment is challenging.

The company's attrition rate has also continued to fall. Its attrition rate fell to 19.2 percent from 21.2 percent the previous quarter on a trailing twelve-month basis. The company's attrition reached 23.8 percent in Q4FY22 and has been trending downward since.

Wipro had initially set a target of adding 30,000 freshers for the year, but given the larger macroeconomic climate, the company has delayed onboarding freshers by several months. The company added 22,000 freshers for the year.

The company reported $2.82 bn in revenue for the fourth quarter, down by 0.6 percent in constant currency terms. Its EBIT margins came in at 16.3 percent, which was in line with what was expected.

On a year-on-year basis, its profit fell marginally by 0.4 percent to Rs 3,074.50 crore for the quarter ending March 2023.",401,-0.9980131983757019

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) announced on April 25 that British retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S) has extended its contract with the IT major to transform its core technology stack, improve resilience and pace of innovation, and drive sustainable growth; this comes at a time when cost-efficiency deals are taking centre stage for IT services firms.

The new modernisation programme is aimed at helping M&S reduce technical debt, improve time to market and enhance scalability.

TCS has been helping M&S drive numerous business-critical transformation programmes for over a decade now. In the next phase of the partnership, TCS will simplify M&S’ technology landscape and modernise its core business systems with a cloud-first and composable platform strategy.

While the company did not disclose the exact deal size, media reports suggest that it could be worth $1 billion.

“As we move into the next phase of our transformation to reshape M&S for growth and value creation, we are delighted to extend our partnership with TCS. Together, we pivoted M&S to a digital-first business and achieved key business outcomes such as growing dotcom, driving loyalty through Sparks and realising significant cost and productivity efficiencies,” said Katie Bickerstaffe, Co-Chief Executive Officer, M&S PLC.

""Their industry advisory capabilities will help us accelerate the pace of business transformation by improving time to market; increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of M&S’ operating model; reducing technical debt; and infusing innovation for growth and value creation.

It's been a fiscal year of slowing net additions in each quarter, but India's top three IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and HCLTech — saw a steep drop in their net addition for the 2023 fiscal year — down cumulatively from 1.97 lakh to 68,886 — a 65 percent drop. This came as companies reported a dismal quarter and were not particularly optimistic about the near term due to the banking crisis in US regional banks and European banks, as well as the macroeconomic climate at large.

Hiring is considered an indicator of demand, and the stress was visible in Q4FY23. There was a 98.7 percent drop in the number of employees the three companies added on a net basis in Q4FY23 compared to the same period last year.

TCS, HCLTech, and Infosys added just 884 employees on a net basis in Q4FY23, compared to 68,257 in Q4FY22. Sequentially, the net addition of the three companies has fallen from 2,375 in Q3FY23.

TCS added 1,03,546 employees in FY22 on a net basis, which fell to 22,600 in FY23.

TCS Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad told analysts that the net addition numbers — 821 in Q4 and 22,600 for the full year — masks the full extent to which they ramped up talent acquisition.

In Q4FY23, TCS added 821 employees which is a significant drop from the 35,209 they added in Q4FY22.

“These numbers mask the full extent to which we had ramped up our talent acquisition during the year to cope with the unprecedented churn in the first half of the year.” Lakkad is referring to the company’s attrition numbers while talking about churn.

The company’s attrition reached 21.5 percent on a last-twelve-month (LTM) basis in Q2FY23, and has moderated to 20.1 percent in Q4. From its peak, TCS’ quarterly annualised attrition is down 10 percent, and expects attrition to return to pre-pandemic levels by the second half of the fiscal.

Lakkad said they onboarded over 44,000 freshers, as well as their “highest ever number of experienced professionals during the year”. For the coming year, the company is looking to add 46,000 campus hires in FY24. He added that the number of lateral hires “will be dependent on the demand from the business every quarter.”

CEO Rajesh Gopinathan also said that it is difficult to call how long the current situation is likely to last, or how the near-to-medium will turn out to be, but that the company did bring down its lateral hiring.

“From an operational perspective, we have been tightening. We are well positioned to be able to react on either side. We had brought down our lateral hiring and our overall capacity addition, leveraging the strong investments that we had made in the last year. We are systematically using the return to normalcy on travel to reposition our employee base in North America, away from the short-term contingent labour back to our more stable employee-led delivery model,” Gopinathan said.

Infosys, on the other hand, saw its yearly net addition nearly halve to 29,219, from 54,396 last year. In Q4, it ended the quarter with 3,611 fewer employees than it had at the end of Q3. In comparison, the company added 21,948 employees on a net basis in the same period last year.

Chief Financial Offer Nilanjan Roy said that the company’s utilisation has declined to 80 percent due to softness in demand.

“We expect the utilisation to improve gradually in the coming quarters as freshers start getting deployed. We will calibrate the hiring for FY24 based on the available pool of employees, growth expectations and attrition trends,” he said. The company hired roughly 51,000 freshers in FY23, but refused to give any targets going ahead.

Roy also told reporters during a press conference after its Q4 results that they have a lot of benches, and they have kept this bench over a period of time and are ready to move into production. “I think our model in terms of hiring has got enough flexibility to take care of new volumes. In any case, we have a rich bench, 80 percent utilisation is what we have, and usually, we have operated well above that,” he said.

The company’s attrition declined to 20.9 percent on an LTM basis in Q4FY23, declining steeply in every quarter of the fiscal year. Roy said that quarterly annualised attrition has reduced by over 4 percent sequentially, is the lowest in the nine quarters, and is below pre-pandemic levels.

Kotak Institutional Equities said in its note that the headcount addition for FY24 could be tepid due to “limited demand visibility, significant headroom on utilisation, moderating lateral attrition and trainees becoming billable”.

HCLTech’s net addition for the year came in at 17,067, down from FY22’s 39,900. For Q4 too, it added 3,674 employees, as opposed to Q4FY22’s 11,100.

CEO C Vijayakumar said during the call with analysts that it had added 3,674 employees in Q4 and 4,480 freshers during the quarter, it is “lower than the last quarter, adjusting for the market conditions.”

“We've added more than 25,000 freshers in the year, the highest in our history. While we are scaling fresher intake, we still have an opportunity here. We will have sustained focus on this over the next two to three years to improve this further,” he added.

Ramachandran Sundararajan, chief people officer said that attrition has been a phenomenal story. The attrition rate in Q4 stood at 19.5 percent on an LTM basis, decreasing significantly from 21.7 percent in the previous quarter and 21.9 percent in the same quarter last year.

Eight of the 10 most valued firms faced a combined erosion of Rs 1,17,493.78 crore in market valuation in an overall weak trend in equities last week, with Infosys taking the biggest hit.

Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank were among the eight companies that suffered a decline in their valuation. ITC and State Bank of India were the only gainers.

Last week, the 30-share BSE Sensex fell by 775.94 points or 1.28 per cent.

The market valuation of Infosys plummeted by Rs 66,854.05 crore to Rs 5,09,215 crore. Infosys Ltd on April 13 reported lower-than-expected growth in the fourth quarter net profit and gave a weak 4-7 per cent revenue growth guidance for FY24 amid tightening of IT budgets by clients following turmoil in the US banking sector.

HDFC Bank's valuation tumbled Rs 10,880.5 crore to Rs 9,33,937.35 crore.

ICICI Bank lost Rs 10,462.77 crore from its valuation which stood at Rs 6,17,477.46 crore and the market capitalisation (mcap) of TCS tanked Rs 10,318.52 crore to Rs 11,56,863.98 crore.

The mcap of Hindustan Unilever declined by Rs 8,458.53 crore to Rs 5,86,927.90 crore and that of HDFC fell by Rs 5,172.27 crore to Rs 5,06,264.24 crore.

The March quarter earnings season has got off to a rocky start for investors, with IT majors posting a sobering set of numbers amid the gathering clouds of recession in the West, even as banking and financial firms put up a robust show thanks to resilient domestic demand.

The week began on an inauspicious note for Dalal Street after its nine-day rally juddered to a halt due to severe selling in the IT pack, led by Infosys.

The Infosys stock suffered ‘a rapid unscheduled disassembly’ (to borrow SpaceX’s terminology) on April 17 after the company’s dismal performance in the March quarter stunned investors.

The company was whiplashed by project cancellations, margin contraction and slowing order inflows triggered by the banking crisis in the US – the bread-and-butter market for India’s software services industry.

More worryingly, the Bengaluru-headquartered firm guided for revenue growth of just 4-7 per cent in 2023-24 (in constant currency terms). For context, its earlier guidance stood at 13-15 percent (for FY23) and 12-14 percent (FY22).

A few days earlier, India's biggest IT firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) too had disappointed the street with lower-than-expected numbers for the last quarter of FY23, leading to a barrage of target price cuts by brokerages.

“The outlook for TCS has been clouded by client caution driving cuts to discretionary tech spends,” JPMorgan noted.

In contrast, it is the smaller IT firms which have propped up morale with upbeat numbers.

HCL Technologies’ profit at Rs 3,981 crore beat estimates, even though revenue lagged behind the projections. (Read full story here).

“Although the outlook for FY24 is uncertain in the near term owing to the challenging macro environment, the resilient model, diverse portfolio mix, strong client additions, a strong deal pipeline and decent hiring makes HCL Tech well placed to navigate the uncertainty,” Sharekhan said.



Cyient too logged a healthy 48 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in consolidated revenue at Rs 1,751 crore, while net profit rose 5.5 percent to Rs 163 crore.

But there’s some grim news for investors ahead of the remaining IT results.

JPMorgan says the fourth quarter results of TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech highlight the weakness in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and telecom verticals.

""We see Tech Mahindra and Mphasis get impacted, given their high exposure to both of these verticals,"" the broking firm wrote in a research note.

The commentary from the US too remains unsettling, with everyone from Warren Buffett to Nouriel Roubini and Jeremy Grantham recently cautioning investors that the US banking crisis is far from over.

There’s no stop loss on pain, after all.

BFSI Booster

Three things are certain in life – death, taxes, and HDFC Bank delivering around 20 percent growth in profits.

The country’s largest private-sector lender on April 15 reported a 20.6 percent growth in net profit at Rs 12,594.5 crore for the quarter ended March, while consolidated net revenue jumped by a similar margin to Rs 34,552.8 crore. (Full numbers here).

It performed well on most parameters – deposit growth, asset quality and capital adequacy – though the stock has not budged this week, maybe due to the overhang of the HDFC merger.

Analysts, however, remain bullish on the counter.

Most banks, in fact, had posted encouraging Q4 business updates, and the street is eyeing a good batch of earnings from this segment.

From the insurance pack, ICICI Prudential Life posted stellar figures, including a 27.2 percent jump in net income to Rs 235 crore for the March quarter on nearly record margins earned from new policies sold.

Brokerage CLSA said the strong fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2023 was supported by a pre-buying trend related to budget tax changes in March 2023, leading to a 27 percent increase in annualized premium equivalent (APE) and a consistently high margin of 32 percent.

In other news….

As if the challenging macro environment wasn’t enough, equity market participants were jolted by a news report, which claimed the government was mulling increases in capital gains taxes for top-income earners.

The Income Tax Department issued a swift rebuttal to calm nerves, but some investors still remain on the edge.

The underlying sense of bearishness was evident when Avalon Technologies sank nearly 9 percent on its market debut on April 18.

Mankind Pharma too managed to attract only a single-digit premium in the grey market on the day of its IPO price band announcement, demonstrating that the glory days of ‘irrational exuberance’ are behind us as of now.

Analysts have also flagged the expensive valuations and only offer-for-sale portion in the IPO as possible reasons for the low premium.

On the other hand, ITC woke up from its interminable slumber and how! The stock hit the Rs 400 milestone this week, catapulting the cigarettes-to-FMCG conglomerate to the elite club of Rs 5 trillion market capitalisation firms.

On April 20, ITC became the 11th listed Indian company to cross Rs 5 trillion market capitalisation after its shares touched a record high with a 21 percent surge so far this year.

ITC @ 400: A story of patience, payback, and a puff of smoke

Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services, HDFC Bank, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Life Insurance Corp of India, State Bank of India, HDFC and Bharti Airtel have earlier achieved this milestone.

ITC on April 21 briefly pipped even HDFC Ltd in terms of value, spreading more cheer among its faithful band of investors.

HCLTech’s CEO and MD C Vijayakumar said uncertainties and delays in deal bookings pertaining to macro-economic headwinds remain restricted to discretionary tech spending and won’t impact overall business. HCLTech reported its full year numbers on April 20.

The third largest IT services firm clocked in deal total contract value (TCV) worth $2.07 billion in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2022. This was an 8 percent drop on a YoY basis as compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. On a sequential quarter basis, this was a plunge of about 12 percent.

As of full year FY23, the company’s order book stood at $8.85 billion, up by 6 percent YoY, against $8.30 billion in FY22.

Deal wins came from across geographies, industries, and service lines. In terms of geographies, Europe grew the highest with 20.6% YoY in constant currency (CC) terms, Americas grew 14.4% CC while rest of the world grew 11% CC. Top performing verticals of the year were technology, telecom, and manufacturing.

“Last quarter we signed 13 large deals across products and services. We won a few large deals in Europe and the US in the financial services sector, which is a sign of our propositions in this market,” Vijayakumar said at the earnings conference call.

He added, “While there are some uncertainties in the system be it booking or ramp up deals delays, they are all on the discretionary spend side. For a lot of run-the-business tech we don’t see that much of stress. That gives us good confidence given our strengths in both transformative and operating spends.”

HCLSoftware business crossed an important milestone of earning $1 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR).

Speaking of outlook for FY24, he said, “I believe FY24 will be a year of consolidation both on the demand and supply side… Clients had accelerated tech spends in the last many quarters, it’s now time to review and consolidate to the most efficient and impactful technologies.”

Remains bullish in financial services

As of Q4, HCLTech got about 21.6 percent of its revenue from the financial services vertical. Vijayakumar continues remain bullish on this segment despite the ongoing global banking crisis with the collapse of US regional banks like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Swiss bank Credit Suisse among others.

He highlighted that only one percent of the company’s revenue has exposure to banks while insurance continues to remain an important segment with financial services.

He still throws an air of caution, saying, “I do think insurance, especially in the financial services segment are under cost pressures due to inflation and they are looking at bringing more efficiencies and automation to their operations. We are well positioned to leverage the opportunity, hence outlook to the segment remains solid.”

He added, “Amidst all the volatility, I want to say our financial services vertical continues to see good opportunities…And also it’s on the strength of both cloud and hybrid cloud adoption in the financial services sector where we have a strong play and that is helping, especially in the capital and insurance markets.”

HCLTech’s financial services vertical sequentially grew 6.9 percent, on the back of large deals the company executed very well and on time to convert it into revenue, Vijayakumar said.

Scope of generative AI

As rivals Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys spoke about their on goings and client conversations on generative artificial intelligence (AI), Vijayakumar too feels that for HCLTech, this technology could be one of the biggest opportunities where the company is trying to find the most impactful use cases for both operations and software development.

“This would also be helpful for building a lot of business use cases for our clients in different verticals. So we have teams working across the board, building those use cases and proof points. Then we will benchmark that with the impact it would create, and clearly double on the high impact use cases,” he said.

Vijayakumar added, “I think it’s a very very strong opportunity. More than the technology itself, a lot of opportunity is there on how the technology can be applied in the real world business context. That’s what we are excited about.”

HCLTech reported its Q4FY23 numbers. Consolidated net profit for the quarter ended March 2023 stood at Rs 3,981 crore, up 10.61 percent against Rs 3,599 crore a year back.

Its revenue from operations for the period stood at Rs 26,606 crore, clocking a growth of 17.74 percent from Rs 22,597 crore.

Equity markets logged in over 1.2 percent decline on April 17, the steepest in five weeks, led primarily by a slump in information technology firms, which was triggered by Infosys' guidance that fuelled concern over tech spending.

Both the benchmark Sensex and the Nifty lost 1.2 percent each. The Sensex fell 728 points to 59,702 points, while the Nifty erased 182 points to 17,645 points around 11.20am on Monday.

Many brokerages have downgraded Infosys after its fourth quarter results disappointed the Street, and cut its target price. JP Morgan has lowered the stock to 'underweight' and cut its target price to Rs 1,200 from Rs 1,500 a share. CLSA cut its target price to Rs 1,550 from Rs 1,800, Citi kept its target price to Rs 1,400 from Rs 1,675 a share, Nomura Research target price was at Rs 1,290 from Rs 1,660, while Bofa cut its target price to Rs 1,390.

""We believe FY24 will be a year of revenue growth disappointment. Increasing macroeconomic headwinds are likely to create challenges in terms of growth, as enterprises delay their decision-making and prioritise cost optimisation projects with upfront benefits, over transformation projects with back-ended returns,"" Nomura Research said in a recent report.

Let's take a look at the factors that drove the markets down today.

Slump in IT Stocks

The Nifty IT index slumped over 6 percent after tech behemoths Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd posted weak earnings for the March quarter. Infosys declined 11 percent, its steepest fall in three years, to hit over a one-year low, shaving off Rs 70,000 crore of investors' wealth. Many brokerages have downgraded the stock after Infosys said the sales growth will be just 4 percent to 7 percent this financial year because of client spending and uncertain demand environment due to failure of US banks.

Wipro and TCS lost 3 percent each, while LTIMindtree fell 8 percent respectively. Persistent Systems, L&T Technology Services, Coforge, Tech Mahindra, Mphasis and HCL Technologies declined up to 6 percent.

Fears of Further Rate Hike by Fed

Retail sales in the US for March have experienced a more significant than anticipated decline of 1 percent month-on-month, exceeding the predicted decrease of 0.5 percent on-month. A detailed analysis of the numbers indicates that consumers are restraining from making discretionary purchases.

However, the core retail sales (excluding auto and gas) declined less than anticipated during March. Despite the weaker retail sales figures and lower inflation prints (CPI and PPI), the markets are now pricing in an 80 percent probability of a 25bps hike in May's policy, up from the previous week's 70 percent, according to analysts.

This shift in market expectations is due to remarks made by Fed member Waller, who expressed support for tightening measures in the battle against inflation. As a result, the probability of a 25bps rate hike during the May meeting has been revised higher.

Surge in Covid Cases

Investors are also worried over the recent spate in fresh Covid cases. India recorded 9,111 new coronavirus infections, while the active cases increased to 60,313, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Monday. The death toll increased to 5,31,141.",536,-0.8156126829294058

The top two IT majors of the country – Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys - have disappointed investors with their Q4 numbers missing the Street estimates on all fronts. The results have been an indication of the recession fear brewing up in developed markets, especially in the US and Europe.

While analysts expect both the stocks to see pain in the short term, Infosys might be a bigger loser because of its heavier weight in the index. Infosys has a 6.68 percent weight on the Nifty50, while Tata Consultancy Services has 4.31 percent weight.

Domestic mutual funds are also significantly overweight on Infosys, compared to TCS. As per Prime Database, mutual funds held 16.04 percent of Infosys’ total share capital as of March-end against TCS’ 3.46 percent.

Infosys’ price-to-earnings ratio at 21.34x is at a 23 percent discount to TCS’ 26.8x, and the Street believes this is justified. DAM Capital has reduced its FY24/25 earnings per share estimates for Infosys by 4.7 percent/6 percent, valuing it at a 20 percent discount rate to TCS.

Over the past one year, TCS has fallen 11.8 percent while Infosys has fallen 24 percent.

“Despite trading at a premium, we have always been bullish on TCS as it has a diversified client set. The company also managed to deliver a positive constant currency growth sequentially at 0.6 percent while Infosys reported -3.2 percent,” AK Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital, told Moneycontrol.

Gaurang Shah of Geojit Financial Services also echoed the same sentiment. “Our order of preference is TCS followed by HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra and Infosys. We are most cautious on Infosys when it comes to deal wins,” he said.

Infosys won deals worth $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, lower than $3.3 billion in Q3. Meanwhile, TCS’ deal wins remained strong at $10 billion, in-line with analyst estimates. Moreover, TCS’ mega deal with BSNL worth $2.9 billion is expected to be closed in Q1 FY24, which holds it in good stead.

From a technical perspective, charts suggest that TCS has enjoyed larger and longer periods of relative outperformance against Infosys and this trend will continue. “The relative strength line of Infosys against TCS topped out in April 2022 and since then it has been making lower tops and is below its 50-week moving average,” according to Milan Vaishnav of Gemstone Equity Research.

Just like the past 12 months, one can expect Infosys to continue to relatively underperform TCS over the near term, he added.​

Tech Mahindra Ltd was more than 7 percent down in the morning trade on April 17 as global brokerage firm Citi downgraded the stock to “sell” from “neutral” and reduced the target price to Rs 955 from Rs 1,100.

The brokerage said Tech Mahindra was downgraded for the following reasons: increased risks to growth in the communications vertical, which accounts for approximately 40 percent of the company’s revenue. Recent data points and commentary have raised concerns, prompting caution from Citi.

There are near-term challenges and a negative catalyst watch is already in place, which may be exacerbated by macroeconomic factors, the brokerage said in its latest report. Operating deleverage may lead to lower margins than what consensus expectations are. Lastly, while there are positives associated with leadership change, they may take some time to materialise.

""In that context, valuations are at 16x 1-yr forward cons EPS – risk-reward looks unfavorable, in our view. We lowered our target multiple to 15x (17x earlier) to factor these risks – new TP of Rs955 (Rs1100 earlier). Our FY24E/FY25E EPS are 7-14 percent below consensus,” Citi said.

It has been a disappointing March quarter for IT firms, so far.

Both Infosys and TCS reported a decline in revenues in the telecom vertical in 4Q, with -8 percent constant currency (CC) quarter on quarter (QoQ) and -2 percent cc QoQ, respectively. Management comments across companies have reflected caution with regard to the telecom sector but the headwinds seem to be stronger than expected.

In its third quarter call, Tech Mahindra had said revenues from top 5 clients had declined due to restructuring in some clients. Though management expected it to stabilise by 4Q, the challenges could persist given macroeconomic uncertainty.

Tech Mahindra is expected to report its March quarter earnings on April 27.

Challenges across multiple verticals such as discretionary cuts and deferrals, vendor consolidation, and pricing pressure could further negatively impact growth, Citi said.

Tech Mahindra has outlined several margin levers, including reducing sub-contracting costs, adjusting the offshoring mix, spinning off or shutting down non-strategic businesses, implementing automation and delivery excellence measures, and leveraging synergies with portfolio companies. The pace of margin improvement in the near term could be slower than expected due to growth challenges and the likelihood of discretionary costs returning, Citi said.

“Guessing at the future rate of interest is, in my opinion, one of the most puzzling problems in the world.” - John Maynard Keynes

Bad news in the IT space continues with Infosys’ underwhelming fourth quarter numbers. IT stocks could be in for some rough weather in the near term, but it is not as if the market did not see it coming. Investors were cautious on the sector even as management commentary was broadly positive through FY23. TCS shares fell less than 2 percent on Thursday despite bearish views from most broking firms. But as the Infosys numbers show, the market needs to brace for a sharp divergence in financial performance among large caps as well.

Infosys

The stock could take a beating today after a rash of rating downgrades and steep cuts in price targets by leading brokers. Nomura, JP Morgan, CLSA and Citi have downgraded their ratings, trimmed target price and earnings per share estimates, while UBS has retained its neutral rating. This could most likely result in fund managers preferring TCS over Infosys near term, as the growth differential between the two has narrowed after the latest quarterly performance.

Tata Motors

The company plans to increase prices of its passenger vehicles from May 1, with the weighted average increase around 0.6 percent. The stock has been on a tear since late March, climbing 17 percent. Strong JLR wholesales for the March quarter has been the key sentiment driver. Consolidated earnings for the December saw a significant improvement with the company reporting a net profit after seven successive quarters of losses. Continuation of that performance will be key to the stock breaking past its peak of Rs 510 seen in January 2022. Broker outlook on the stock at this point is largely positive, with JP Morgan being the notable exception. JPM has a neutral rating on the stock as it remains cautious on demand and pricing for FY24 because of inventory levels normalizing. It has also flagged growth moderation in commercial vehicles as well as passenger vehicles.

Zee Entertainment

CNBCTV18 reports that institutional investor Oppenheimer is looking to sell a 5.65 percent stake through an open market deal for between Rs 200-Rs 208 a share. Oppenheimer has been a vocal critic of Zee management’s corporate governance for a while now, and the deal could come as a relief to both parties. It also removes a key overhang for the stock, which has been struggling for the last six months despite repeated assurances from Zee that the merger deal with Sony is well on track.

SBI

India’s number one lender has said that it will keep lending rates unchanged effective April 15. Banks in general have been steadily cranking up lending rates for the last many months. SBI’s latest move could most likely have to do with the RBI pausing on rate hikes. But the central bank had made it clear that the pause was a one-off and further measures will depend on the inflation trajectory. It may still be early for borrowers for rejoice. From the stock market perspective, the shift money-from equity-to-fixed income trade is pretty much alive and kicking.

Good news and bad

The good news first: US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that the US Federal Reserve may not have to raise interest rates by much in the days ahead. The bad news: banks are likely to become more cautious and may tighten lending further in the wake of recent bank failures.

In an interview to CNN, Yellen said that a restriction in credit in the economy could be a substitute for further interest rate hikes that the Fed needs to make.

Dr Copper

Copper prices touched a seven-week high of $9,200 a tonne ($4.12 a pound) on Friday, but bulls of the red metal may need to keep their enthusiasm in check.

Despite a rosy demand outlook due to the green energy transition, historically low inventories, and supply growth uncertainty, weakness in China’s building sector has kept medium-term copper price predictions muted, reports website ming.com

Watch out Tesla

Little known Chinese electric car maker BYD could well overtake Tesla as the biggest global seller of pure EVs, according to a report in The Economist newspaper. In China, BYD is already giving Tesla a run for its money.

“Tesla last year reduced its prices in China twice. BYD increased its prices. BYD is so much ahead of Tesla in China ... it’s almost ridiculous,” renowned value investor Munger recently told CNBC. BYD gave a preliminary estimate of its 2022 net profit as $2.4-2.5 billion, a fivefold jump over the previous, which analysts say is an indication that it is now competing with Tesla in the premium category.

Slow EV adoption

The US is lagging behind much of the developed world in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, reports zerohedge.com citing a survey by the Financial Times.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) expects to bring down its attrition rate close to its pre-pandemic range of 12-13 percent by the second half of the fiscal year 2023-24, Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) Milind Lakkad said. The IT services behemoth has started to slow down hiring and focus on improving employee utilisation rates.

The attrition rate of the January-December quarter stood at 20.1 percent on a last twelve-month (LTM) basis. This is an improvement from the previous (Q3) attrition rate of 21.3 percent. TCS has also reduced hiring, adding only around 821 new employees in Q4FY22-23, compared to 35,209 employees in Q4 of FY21-22.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, Lakkad said, “We want to go down to our original levels. So 12-13 percent is the band which we are comfortable with… I know my numbers will really come back close to this range. We expect to reach pre-pandemic number levels in the second half of this year.”

TCS rolled out 46,000 offers to freshers in FY22-23, and plans to hire around 40,000 freshers in FY23-24.

Besides these 40,000 freshers, Lakkad said the company will also hire between 5,000-8,000 employees across its offices in Latin America (LATAM), Asia-Pacific (APAC), United Kingdom (UK), Europe, and north America. The north America, UK, APAC, and LATAM offices also hire a significant number of trainees.

“40,000 is the number of trainees hired primarily from India. Apart from that, we do hire a significant number in LATAM and APAC. In Europe, not a very big number yet, but yeah, we do hire in Europe, North America,” he said.

Lakkad added that in Europe the company had started with a few countries and will expand its presence further.

Skills expected to be in demand this year include analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) in roles across industries such as banking, retail, manufacturing, pharma, etc., Lakkad said.

Return to office

In September 2022, TCS had mandated that employees would have to work from the office three days a week. TCS COO N Ganapathy Subramaniam, in an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol in January, had said that 2.1 lakh of the company’s 6.13 lakh employees, roughly a third of their workforce, had started working from office at least thrice a week.

Lakkad updated that as of now, nearly 53 percent of its employees across campuses are working from office twice a week, and about 43 percent thrice a week.

“There are multiple challenges. People have moved to their hometowns, and some of them have kids who joined schools in that area. So they are taking time. Others have some other genuine challenges. We're working through all of that. It’'s taking longer than what I initially thought it would. But it’s moving in the right direction. I want it to move faster,” Lakkad said, explaining why they still don’t have everyone coming to office every day.

TCS had announced its 25/25 vision earlier, wherein by 2025 only 25 percent of the employees were to work out of TCS facilities at any time. Lakkad said that while that plan was still on, his priority was to first get all employees to come to work thrice a week.

“And then we will see how it’s going, what the work model is, what the people and industries are thinking,” he said.

He added, “We have been working 100 percent remotely, during which time we have actually delivered to our customers reasonably well. But we still believe we should not lose that connection with the people. Just talking to them only in the context of work and nothing else is not a good thing.”

Generative AI to aid employees

During its earnings call on April 12, TCS had said that all its clients are actively looking for the integration of generative AI and ChatGPT into the offerings of the IT services firm.

""In my interactions with clients over the last quarter, the conversation starts and stops with ChatGPT. Everybody talks about ChatGPT and what it's going to do. That’s the theme in all the deal wins we have, and a huge amount of focus on cloud data. Machine learning is also a very, very important area of focus,” Subramaniam had said during the earnings call.

Now it turns out that not just for its customers, TCS is exploring generative AI solutions even for its own employees, to enable them to be more productive.

Around two quarters back TCS had started to work on an internal gig platform to let its employees have the opportunities to learn quickly, explore, and work on different technologies, environments, customers, and industries beyond their regular jobs.

But the gig platform will now require some reconsideration and tweaks as generative AI and AI co-workers can do the same work without involving the core teams, Lakkad said.

“These things are evolving as we speak. With new technologies coming in, our own thinking is also evolving. We are looking into what generative AI means in the context of an enterprise, not just from the standpoint of what the operating model will be, but also what will be the role of an employee versus the role of an AI co-worker,” Lakkad said.

Lakkad added that with generative AI being used, there are also discussions underway about safeguarding intellectual property (IP), security, etc.

Rival Infosys too has been talking about betting big on generative AI and ChatGPT as demand from clients and active projects around the technology continue to grow.",914,0.6952036619186401

The country's largest IT services company TCS will continue investing in research and innovation, office spaces and technology infrastructure at the same pace even as it wades through near-term volatilities, a senior official has said.

The company's promise to continue with the normal wage hikes will hit the operating profit margins by a further 1.70-1.75 per cent in the June quarter, its chief financial officer Samir Seksaria said, adding that the key number will stabilise going ahead into the new fiscal.

He said the company typically spends Rs 1,200-1,500 crore in research and innovation and Rs 3,000-4,000 crore as capital expenditure on back-end technology needed to deliver work and office spaces, and the same should continue going ahead.

""...we continue to invest, we continue to invest in talent, we continue to invest in research, into innovation, into branding and into IT. And we don't believe there should be any reason for that to be any different from what we have always done,"" Seksaria told PTI.

The company reported setbacks to its business in its biggest market North America and its largest industry vertical banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) because of worsening sentiment due to tech layoffs and the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank.

This led it to report a 0.6 per cent growth in constant currency on a sequential basis, which Seksaria said is unusual for the fourth quarter.

Terming the overall 13.7 per cent rise in revenues in FY23 on top of the over 15 per cent jump in FY22 as a decent growth, Seksaria said the company hopes that things will get better with the beginning of the new year, and did not expect massive layoffs post-vacations, and the SVB collapse only aggravated things.

Seksaria declined to share the company's outlook about future revenue growth or on profit margins it aspires to exit FY24 with, saying that the focus right now is to be close to the customer, understand their needs and deliver on it.

The company is planning to continue with its normal wage revisions, even in the face of the volatilities it is wading through, Seksaria said, adding that the best performers can expect a hike of up to 15 per cent this year as well.

""Historically, we have had the salary hike impacts between 1.50-2 per cent, somewhere between 1.70-1.75 per cent being the average. That should be something which we can expect,"" Seksaria said.

The pricing environment is ""stable"", he said, hinting that it has not been impacted because of the ongoing troubles in the IT sector. Customers want leaner organisations and simpler processes, which help them save costs, for which they continue to come to IT companies, he said, pointing out to new orders of USD 10 billion registered in the March quarter, of which half were from North America.

When asked about the impact of the work deferments on the total contract value conversion into revenue booking, Seksaria said the company tracks the number but declined to share the same.

On the 26-28 per cent operating profit margin band aspiration, he said there is no reason why the business model should not be able to deliver that number as things normalise, but stressed that achieving that the number comes at 24.5 per cent in Q4FY23 was ""significant"".

He said the investments, which are very small when compared to the overall revenues for the company, which it is planning to continue with, will not have an impact on the profit margins as the margin figure is arrived at after accounting for the spends.

The company is planning to continue aiming for higher utilisation and lowering the reliance on outsourced workers as it chases the aspiration of profit margin expansion, Seksaria said, adding that the business associates' costs have already come down to over 8 per cent of revenues in March quarter and it will go back to the historical average of 7-7.5 per cent.

Seksaria also said that the company expects the trend of higher revenue booking from Europe and UK, which collectively account for nearly a third of its revenues, to continue as North America faces the chill due to near-term volatilities.

He said clients in the UK and Europe have internalised the macro situation and the Russia-Ukraine war being a prolonged one due to which they have started re-engaging with the IT companies.",761,0.31953999400138855

While the underwhelming earnings of India’s top two IT services firms have disappointed the street, some more pain may be on the cards as the management of both companies warned of further subdued demand amid macro uncertainties plaguing the US and Europe.

On April 13, Infosys reported a 7.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in its consolidated net profit of Rs 6,128 crore, while revenue increased 16 percent to Rs 37,441 crore. The company saw a quarterly de-growth of 4.4 percent and 2.3 percent in profit and revenue, respectively.

The company's US-listed shares fell 10 percent in New York trading, while it closed 3 percent lower on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) on April 13. Meanwhile, its peer and the country’s largest IT firm, TCS, closed 2 percent down.

TCS also reported lower-than-expected numbers with revenue from operations increasing 16.9 percent YoY at Rs 59,162 crore, and profit growing 14.8 percent to Rs 11,392 crore. Sequentially, growth came in at 1.4 percent and 5 percent for revenue and profit, respectively.

“The March quarter has been weaker than anticipated, primarily due to North America,"" said TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, adding, ""We were expecting a comeback after a seasonally-weak third quarter, but that didn’t happen.""

While the March quarter was expected to be seasonally weak, with analysts also anticipating and factoring in additional subdued growth due to weakness in the financial services segment resulting from liquidity concerns in the US and Europe due to the collapse of SVB and Credit Suisse, the performance was weaker than anticipated and is especially concerning at a time when talks of recession are also trickling in.

“I think in the near term there are challenges. Analysts have assigned a 30-35 percent probability that the US might be going through a recession, so yes, there is a bit of a risk in the near-term, because of which the TCS management has been a bit cautious in its guidance,” said Sumit Jain of ICICI Securities in an interview to ET.

TCS management has not indicated when it expects growth to pick up and whether it will be front- or back-loaded in FY23-24, said Girish Pai, Head of Research at Nirmal Bang, a broking firm, adding that he suspects that growth will be broadly weak across all quarters and possibly turn weaker in the second half, since he thinks that the adverse impact of a weak macro lies ahead and not behind us.

Meanwhile, Infosys has given a USD CC (constant currency) revenue growth guidance of 4-7 percent YoY, citing increased macro uncertainties.

“The 4Q revenue growth was surprising and is likely to have a dampening effect on the company’s FY23-24 growth, particularly since it suggests a significant impact on growth from Infosys’s discretionary business, which has been facing pressure in the recent few months due to the macroeconomic slowdown. We expect FY23-24 revenue growth to be around 5.2 percent YoY in CC terms, which is near the lower end of the guidance band, as it takes time for mega deals to convert into orders and revenues,” said analysts at Motilal Oswal.

For TCS, they said that management commentary on near-term demand was among the weakest in recent history (excluding the initial months of the pandemic), with the management indicating weakness in the US on account of deferrals in clients’ discretionary spends with the BFSI (banking and financial services) vertical being the most affected.

Foreign brokerage firm Nomura reduced its Buy rating for Infosys to Neutral, while also cutting its target price (TP) to Rs 1,290 from Rs 1,660 earlier. It said that the guidance and deal wins indicate a weak outlook and the growth differential with TCS will narrow.

A number of large corporations, including Kotak Bank, SBI, HUL, TCS, ICICI Pru, Tech Mahindra and HDFC, constituting a market cap of around $465 billion, or 21 percent of the Nifty weight and 17 percent of total FII holdings, are set to see a change in the corner office over the next 12 months.

Several large-cap companies such as HUL, TCS, Tech Mahindra, and ICICI Pru have announced changes in the rank of the chief executive offer (CEO) over the last few weeks. This makes a complete U-turn in the trend observed during the Covid period when too few transitions were recorded in the CEO rank.

Businesses are now dealing with a changed macro environment and geopolitical situations that make CEO changes more likely. Certain companies such as Reliance Industries have even started generational changes in leadership.

TCS leads the league of Nifty50 behemoths where the corner office sees change in occupants this year. While Krithivasan will take over as CEO and MD of TCS from June 1, HUL will have Rohit Jawa as the new CEO and MD by June 27.

Some corner offices will vacant this year because of the end of term of the reigning chief executives. Uday Kotak’s tenure as the MD and CEO of Kotak Bank will end by December 31 and Dinesh Khara’s term will be up for renewal at SBI in October. Whereas HDFC Limited will have a new CEO and MD in Sashidhar Jagdishan after the twins merge.

Assessing the Impact

Jefferies India stumbled upon surprising results as it picked up 72 CEO transitions to assess the impact of the change in the high chair. The 'zero date' was defined as one month prior to the actual announcement of the CEO change. According to the analysis, in 53 percent of the cases, the trend in the stock price did not change around the time of the transition.

In cases where there was a change, 68 percent of them were for the better, which means an underperforming stock became outperforming in six months, with a split between internal and external hires.

External hires seemed to have made a positive difference in the stock price trends in many cases. Among the 72 transitions analysed, less than 40 percent of large-caps replaced CEOs with external hires, while 55 percent of smaller-cap companies chose to hire externally.

Among sectors, it was found that the changes in CEOs triggered a disproportionate change in Staples where five out of seven saw a change in relative performance. In non-bank financials, it was eight out of 10, but practically none in consumer discretionary with only one out of 10.

The study suggests that CEO transitions do not necessarily require investors to re-look at their portfolios. However, it is important to note that this analysis only looked at the impact of CEO transitions over a six-month period from the 'zero date'. Over longer terms, other factors can influence stock performance and must be taken into account, Jefferies mentioned.",498,0.0004112422466278076

TCS reported Q4FY23 earnings that missed street expectations, causing a 2% slump in the Nifty IT index, with TCS also trading down by 2%.

Nifty IT index on Thursday witnessed a 2 percent slump after Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) earnings for Q4FY23 missed expectations of the Street traded down 2 percent.

Despite a 14.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 11,392 crore and a 16.9 percent growth in revenue to Rs 59,162 crore, TCS missed estimates, with quarterly growth at 1.6 percent for revenue and 5.0 percent for net profit. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin contracted 0.5 percent to 24.5 percent.

While analysts predicted subdued growth in a seasonally weak quarter, the recent US banking crisis has resulted in estimate cuts by analysts and increased caution among investors.

“Q4 missed across board from unexpected weakness in US and continued Challenges in Europe,” said JPMorgan who have given TCS an ‘underweight’ rating and a target price of Rs 2,700, implying a downside of around 17 percent.

Indian IT companies that rely heavily on revenue from the BFSI sector, particularly from the US and Europe, are facing significant setbacks due to the banking crisis resulting from the collapse of SVB and the subsequent takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS.

As clients in these markets face liquidity concerns, IT firms are expected to see decreased technology spending budgets and delayed decision-making, leading to project deferrals.

While TCS recorded an order book value of $10 billion this quarter, Morgan Stanley, with an 'equal-weight' rating and a target price of Rs 3,350, says clarity is limited on whether sentiment has troughed despite the strong order book.

The rest of the IT pack is also expected to largely follow a similar trend and either report flat or negative growth for Q4FY23.

1. Retail inflation falls to 15-month low of 5.66 per cent in March, industrial output steady

Retail inflation in India eased to a 15-month low of 5.66 per cent in March from 6.44 per cent in February, mainly due to a sharp drop in food inflation and justifying the Reserve Bank of India’s decision last week to pause interest rate increases. Separately, industrial production growth was steady at 5.6 per cent in February, compared with 5.5 per cent in the preceding month, indicating a resilient economy despite global headwinds amid high interest rates.

Why it’s important: If retail inflation keeps easing, the Reserve Bank may lengthen its pause on increasing the policy rate in its next review in June. The government’s capital spending continues to provide support to industrial growth.

2. TCS misses earnings estimates as key markets in US, Europe turn cautious

Tata Consultancy Services failed to meet earnings estimates by analysts as clients, particularly banks, turned cautious about spending amid a crisis in the US and Europe. Net profit rose 15 per cent to Rs 11,392 crore in the March quarter. Profit rose 5 per cent sequentially. Analysts had estimated a profit of Rs 11,530 crore on average, according to a Bloomberg poll. Sales rose 17 per cent to Rs 59,160 crore.

Why it’s important: As life returns to normal after the pandemic, the sharp spike in digitization spending has moderated. Weakness in the US due to the banking crisis might keep near-term prospects muted.

3. Nifty rules could be modified ahead of demerger of Reliance’s financial services arm

The National Stock Exchange might tweak the framework on addition and removal of stocks in its benchmark Nifty index before Reliance Industries goes ahead with its proposed demerger of financial services unit. Current rules require a Nifty constituent to be excluded in the event of a demerger. With a market cap of Rs 15.9 lakh crore, Reliance Industries has the highest weighting of 9.9 per cent in the 50-share gauge.

Why it’s important: The National stock exchange would not want index heavyweight Reliance to be removed from Nifty as that might lead to selling to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore by passive funds.

4. General Atlantic infuses addition $100 million in PhonePe, more in pipeline

General Atlantic has invested an additional $100 million in PhonePe as a part of the payments company’s $1-billion primary funding plan and may infuse another $100-200 million. If that happens, General Atlantic and affiliate funds would have invested $550-600 million as a part of PhonePe’s mega fundraise. The fresh funding was raised at a $12 billion valuation.

Why it’s important: The huge primary fundraising by PhonePe is against the trend of the funding slowdown among Indian startups, which are compelled to tighten their belts. The payments firm will use the money to expand its business aggressively.

5. India intends to turn airports into aviation hubs, minister Scindia says

The central government has set in motion a plan to transform Indian airports into aviation hubs beginning with the Delhi airport to ensure seamless connectivity and minimize connection time between flights, civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has said. It has hired a consultant for the Delhi airport, which will consider aspects needed for the hub, such as the concentration of airlines, domestic to international connectivity, and minimal connection times between airlines.

Why it’s important: There has been a surge in air traffic after the pandemic and airlines anticipate record travel in the peak summer season. The government is planning head to handle the consistent surge in demand for air travel.

6. Government working to resolve concerns on angel tax and fair market valuations

The central department for promotion of industry and internal trade is working with the finance ministry to resolve the concerns of startups regarding the contentious angel tax and fair market valuation. Indian start-ups have expressed apprehensions on securing funding after the federal budget proposed to subject foreign investors to an angel tax.

Why it’s important: A new angel tax may further deter overseas investors at a time when local start-ups are already facing a so-called funding winter. Start-up deal volume has already reached a nearly nine-year low in February, indicating weak sentiment.

7. Vedanta-Foxconn’s talks with STMicroelectronics on semiconduction facility hits road bump

The Vedanta-Foxconn semiconductor consortium’s discussions with STMicroelectronics for inducting the European company as a technology partner is stuck due to lack of agreement on finer details of technology transfer, the duration of the partnership and the funds to be invested by each company. Key sticking points include STMicro’s desire to limit the scope of the technology transfer as well as including a sunset clause on the duration of the joint venture.

Why it’s important: The induction of a technology partner is key for the Vedanta-Foxconn consortium qualifying as a beneficiary of the central government’s Rs 76,000 crore incentive since neither Vedanta nor Foxconn have the required experience in operating a semiconductor factory.

8. Four investors place bids for Blackstone’s stake in IBS Software

Private equity investors Thomas H. Lee Partners, CVC Capital, Temasek and Apax Partners have placed bids for Blackstone’s stake in IBS Software. The bids range from $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion. Blackstone is seeking to sell its 40 per cent stake in IBS Software and has hired investment bank JP Morgan to conduct the process. It wants an enterprise valuation of around $2 billion.

Why it’s important: IBS provides IT solutions to the travel sector, particularly airlines, hospitality, and logistics businesses, which are expanding at a rapid clip in India. This has led to strong investor interest.

9. India doubles smartphone experts to $1.1 billion in 2022-23 on Apple boost

India has doubled its exports of smartphones to $11.1 billion (Rs 91,000 crore) in 2022-23 compared with $5.48 billion (Rs 45,000 crore) in the preceding financial year, mainly due to sharply increased production of Apple iPhones in the country, according to the India Cellular and Electronics Association.

Why it’s important: The mood is upbeat on smartphone exports. India could become a leader in the global mobile device market if this trend continues.

10. Price war starts to garner market share in satellite and broadband TV services

Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio Infocomm are at loggerheads over Jio’s recent move to offer numerous live TV channels with its JioFiber home broadband service. India’s largest DTH operator, Tata Play (earlier Tata Sky) has also hit out at both Jio and Airtel for bundling live TV channels and over-the-top apps with their broadband offers, calling them instances of predatory pricing.

Why it’s important: Prices of streaming services is already quite competitive in India compared with more developed markets. A price war will further squeeze margins of all leading players.",1134,0.24856648221611977

K Krithivasan, who will take over as CEO of Tata Consultancy Services on June 1, has told analysts that there will be no rush to make changes to the company's structure.

He explained that the current structure was put in place after a lot of internal deliberations and that any tweaks required would be made after meeting with customers and associates.

The company's current structure, which was unveiled last April under outgoing CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, divided clients into four different business groups based on the stage of their journey with the company, rather than verticals. Gopinathan and Krithivasan will be meeting with clients over the next six to eight weeks.

Sources previously told Moneycontrol that not all senior leadership members were satisfied with TCS' restructuring. K Krithivasan, who was previously the global head for the BFSI vertical and will become the new CEO, reportedly kept his department out of the restructuring.

Prior to his promotion, Krithivasan was responsible for the largest vertical of TCS, which generates 35-40% of the company's revenue. In his new role, he will focus on becoming familiar with the non-BFSI side of the business.

Krithivasan had previously stated that he did not plan on making any immediate organizational or structural changes to the company.

“We (Rajesh Gopinathan and Krithivasan) have enjoyed every moment in this organization. It's a continuum. It's not that as every CEO changes, we come up with a new strategy or new set of priorities. We have a core set of beliefs and values. We're focusing on employees, focusing on our customers is the most important engine that drives our growth. We always try to be close to our customers,” he had said.

TCS' outgoing CEO, Rajesh Gopinathan, will continue to assist with the transition until September 15, while K Krithivasan takes over on June 1.

Gopinathan explained that during the first half of the transition period, he will be primary and Krithivasan will be shadow, and vice versa in the second half.

He emphasised that the transition will be done diligently, although he doesn't expect it to be overly complicated.

The macroeconomic climate has led to Tata Consultancy Services taking a pessimistic tone, but clients of the company are captivated with generative AI, says the company’s Chief Operating Officer NG Subramaniam. According to him, clients are questioning how they are integrating software like ChatGPT into their offerings, or if they have plans to do so.

""In my interactions with all these clients over the last quarter, the conversation starts and stops with ChatGPT. Everybody talks about ChatGPT and what it's going to do. It’s very clear that innovation is surpassing productivity. That kind of theme is what is spanning out in all these deal wins that we have, it's a huge amount of focus on cloud data. At the same time, you know, machine learning is a very, very important area of focus for people,” he said while addressing journalists after the company announced its results for Q4FY23.

For now, the focus of TCS will be on how they apply aspects like machine learning and deep learning to the data and “raise the bar” for their delivery capabilities.

The company is also running pilots, and plans to have a centre of excellence around the technology.

“ChatGPT kind of a technology is like any other tool, any other technology. As it matures, I think we will be ready for it. We will have a centre of excellence around it, we will have core competencies built around it and then see what are the drawbacks on it. What are the pros for it, and then use it the right way to deliver responsibly and meaningfully to our clients,” he said.

He added that while it may be too early to say how it will pan out in the future, he believed that with generative AI, “every small area that was not touched upon by technology, I think it has the potential to be touched”.

You're going to see technology everywhere and it will only accelerate the adoption of some of the borderline technology or frontier areas of technology, he added.

Speaking to analysts, he said that generative AI has the potential to live up to the expectation.

“Many quarters ago, I mentioned that AI/ML has the potential to fundamentally change the way that we deliver software to our clients and a significant part of what we are doing today can get automated, can get generated…I think we are quite excited about the opportunity of delivering proven code. Whether you can call it a low code, no code, zero-code, or a generative AI kind of software, the result is a software that generates software. I think we’ve built such an expertise around that capability, around the toolset and stay relevant to our clients' expectations,” he said.

However, there has been one looming question ever since ChatGPT burst onto the scene and generative AI became a part of everyday lexicon: will it replace people and take away jobs?

Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said this is something they’ve seen for many years — that whenever a new technology comes in, jobs don’t reduce, they change. “We’ll have to add on skills to what they learn and based on that new value will be created for the customer,” he said.",538,0.2039918541908264

Tata Consultancy Services has already rolled out offers to 46,000 freshers for the FY24, at a time that the industry has been marred by onboarding delays in a challenging macroeconomic climate.

Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said that over 6,00,000 people had appeared for the company’s national qualifier test, and 46,000 offers have already been rolled out.

In FY23, the company has onboarded over 44,000 freshers, beating its target of 40,000 for the year.

The company onboarded roughly 2,000 freshers during the last quarter of the fiscal. It onboarded 15,000 freshers during Q2, 20,000 in Q2, and roughly 7,000 freshers in Q3FY23. It hired over 1 lakh freshers in FY22.

“We are honouring all job offers, and have added 22,600 employees on a net basis in FY 23. During the year, we onboarded over 44K freshers and our highest-ever number of experienced professionals,” Lakkad said in a statement.

Speaking to the press, Lakkad said that the company honoured all its offers, and will continue to do so.

“There were some delays -- a month or two -- for onboarding people, but it will happen. We honoured all the offers. In future, no reduction in salaries, nothing. Whatever we are committed is what we offer,” he said.

The offer rollout comes at a time when the company’s net headcount addition has slowed significantly, adding just 821 employees on a net basis in Q4FY23.

The company added 22,600 employees in FY23 on a net basis, a steep decline from last fiscal’s 1.03 lakh.

Lakkad said that the company will be paying out 100 percent of the variable pay for the quarter, and upcoming hikes for high performers will be at 12-15 percent, as is standard. Other hike bands are 8 percent, 5 percent and 1.5 percent.",296,-0.16623004674911498

Despite a tough business environment due to macroeconomic headwinds, the IT services giant saw its all-time high number of large deals signed in a quarter.

However, the total contract value (TCV) for Q4 was down by 11.5 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis as compared to $11.3 billion reported in Q4FY22. Full-year TCV for FY23 stood at $34.1 billion, down from $34.6 billion in FY22.

Some of the deal wins in Q4 include UK insurer Phoenix Group’s $723 million deal, Telefonica Germany, KeySight, Bitcoin Suisse AG, Bombardier, CTBC Bank, Taiwan, etc to name a few.

According to analysts, TCS is one of the key beneficiaries as clients focus on cost-takeout deals and look at vendor consolidation.

Rajesh Gopinathan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, TCS said: “It is very satisfying to look back at our strong growth in FY2023, on top of the mid-teen growth in the prior year. The strength of our order book demonstrates the resilience of demand for our services and gives us visibility for growth in the medium term.”

“Demand scenario is varying by market. At the start of the year, we expected North America to recover well, but that has not happened. Other markets have grown as expected. The UK has been strong, increasing positive growth in Europe,” Gopinath told the media.

He said that this quarter has come in weaker than expected, primarily due to North America. The company saw volatility in the banking system and said it was difficult to call out how long this will last.

“Near term needs to be watched. Demand for tech-led transformation and optimisation continues to be strong but requires a very nuanced approach by market and vertical,” Gopinath said.

The January-March quarter was marked by the global banking crisis with the collapse of several US-based regional banks, including the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank and Swiss bank Credit Suisse – adding to the IT sector’s woes as it is already struggling with macro-economic challenges. As of Q3, TCS got around 38.5 percent of its revenue from the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) vertical, the highest BFSI exposure among Tier-I Indian IT firms.

Incoming CEO K Krithivasan, who heads the company’s BFSI vertical, said that sentiments were down in the sector as people rushed to save costs.

“People rushed to save costs. It's more sentiments at play than anything structural. Large bank clients are benefitting from increasing deposits in North America. Some issues in US, other markets are doing quite well for us,” Krithivasan said.

In Q4, the company had 60 clients in the $100 Mn+ band, 133 in the $50 Mn+ band, 291 in the $20 Mn+ band, 461 in the $10 Mn+ band and 1241 in the $1 Mn+ band.

On a year-on-year basis in constant currency terms, growth in Q4 was led by Retail and CPG (13 percent) and Life Sciences and Healthcare (12.3 percent), followed by Technology & Services grew 9.2 percent, BFSI grew 9.1 percent, Manufacturing grew 9.1 percent and Communications & Media grew 5.3 percent.

The TCV for Q4 stood at $10 billion, higher than its guidance of $7-9 billion. TCV was up 28.1 percent from $7.8 billion in Q3. On a YoY basis, the number was lower than $11.3 billion TCV clocked in Q4FY22, its highest-ever quarterly order book.

“We expect strong deal-wins of $10 bn+ for the quarter, assuming normal renewal component. We do not include TCV from (the) mega deal with BSNL that is likely to be signed with TCS. TCS' commentary on growth outlook will be keenly followed. TCS is expected to be a beneficiary of higher focus of enterprises on cost take-outs and core modernisation,” analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in their note prior to the earnings.

For the entire fiscal, TCS has reported a revenue of Rs 2.25 lakh crore, which is 17.6 percent higher than Rs 1.91 lakh crore recorded in FY22. The net profit in FY23 came in at Rs 42,303 crore, which is also higher as compared to Rs 38,449 crore in the previous year.",695,0.3846946175281818

Incoming Tata Consultancy Services Chief Executive Officer K Krithivasan will take over the post on June 1, with outgoing CEO Rajesh Gopinathan staying on till September 15 to help with the transition.

""…we wish to inform that the Board of Directors of the Company have, at its meeting held today, appointed Mr. K. Krithivasan as the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of the Company to take over from Mr. Rajesh Gopinathan with effect from June 1, 2023, subject to approval of the shareholders,"" TCS said in a filing with the exchanges.

""Krithi and I are working closely to ensure that the leadership transition over the next few months is smooth and seamless to all our stakeholders, and that TCS is well positioned to capture the opportunities ahead,"" Gopinathan said in a statement.

Hours after being named as the CEO designate last month, 58-year-old Krithivasan said there would be no great organisational or strategic change on the anvil for the company after he takes over.

Gopinathan told the press that this transition is standard for the company, and that they will be meeting clients over the next six to eight weeks.

""So first half I'm primary he's shadow, second half he's primary I'm shadow. Having said that, I don't expect the transition to be rocket science, but it needs to be done diligently...We're now going to be traveling for the next six to eight weeks, meeting with customers, meeting with our field teams. That's been planned and then we're going to be executing on that,"" he said.

On changes after taking over, Krithivasan said they are not in a hurry to do any structural or organisational change. ""We will talk to the associates, to our customers, we will see what is required and do whatever is required at the time,"" he said.

Krithivasan is a TCS lifer, having been with the company for 34 years. Before his elevation, Krithivasan was the global head of the company’s BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) business group, the largest vertical for the company which accounts for 35-40 percent of the revenue.

Krithivasan has been a CEO waiting in the wings for a while now, having been one of the contenders even when Gopinathan was appointed in 2017.

Sources previously told Moneycontrol that Krithivasan has built a reputation for being great at execution. While Gopinathan is an intellectual, brilliant thinker and strategic leader, Krithivasan can execute any blueprint, they said.

Chirajeet Sengupta, partner, global technology services, at consulting firm Everest Group, had said at that time of the incoming CEO’s appointment that Krithivasan is a very credible leader.

“He [Krithivasan] well-liked, well-respected, and well-known by clients. He's been in the trenches. He's been with clients for pretty much his entire career,” he said. “Rajesh was the CFO becoming a CEO, whereas Krithi has been a business unit leader.

Consolidated revenue grew by 1.6% QoQ to Rs 59,162 crore with revenue in dollar terms rising 1.7% to $7,195 million and topline growth in constant currency 0.6%. On the operating front, consolidated EBIT rose 1.4% to Rs 14,488 crore with margin flat at 24.5% for the quarter. The company has announced a final dividend of Rs 24 per share. Meanwhile, the board has appointed K Krithivasan as MD & CEO of the company with effect from June 1, 2023 after resignation of Rajesh Gopinathan.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which kicked off the earnings season on April 12, added 22,600 employees during FY23, a steep decrease as compared to its net addition in FY22. In the previous year, it had added 1.03 lakh employees on a net basis during the year. With this, the company’s headcount as of March 31, 2023, stood at 6,14,795.

This is the company’s lowest net headcount addition since FY15 when it had added 19,000 employees on a net basis during the year.

The company had added 40,185 employees on a net basis in FY21, 24,179 in FY20 and 29,287 in FY19.

During the last quarter of the fiscal, TCS saw a marginal increase of 821 employees on a net basis after last quarter’s decline of 2,197 employees, signalling the current stress in the IT sector. TCS added 35,209 employees in the same quarter last year.

TCS added 14,136 employees in Q1FY23, 9,840 in Q2, saw a decrease of 2,197 employees in Q3, and an increase of 821 in Q4.

Milind Lakkad, the company’s Chief Human Resources Officer, said, “We are honouring all job offers, and have added 22,600 employees on a net basis in FY 23. During the year, we onboarded over 44K freshers and our highest-ever number of experienced professionals.”

Last quarter, Lakkad said the hiring slowdown was not a blip, but was planned this way.

Attrition for the quarter fell to 20.1 percent, continuing its downward trend from last quarter’s 21.3 percent. As the talent market cools off, attrition rates have continued to normalise further, and it is also in line with the management’s commentary about attrition being expected to fall in coming quarters.

The hiring slowdown is on expected lines, as companies take a cautious approach to fresh hiring after the highs of FY22.

Growth came below expectations, in a seasonally-weak quarter, analysts had estimated the Tata Group company to report 2.1 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth in revenue, while net profit was projected to increase 6.2 percent QoQ in the January-March quarter.

Consolidated revenue from operations came in at Rs 59,162 crore, up 16.9 percent, from Rs 50,591 crore in the year-ago quarter. It stood at Rs 58,229 crore in the December quarter of FY23.

In constant currency (cc) terms, the revenue rose 10.7 percent year-on-year (YoY), the company said.

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) stood at Rs 14,488 crore with EBIT margin contracting 0.5 percent YoY to 24.5 percent. Net margin came in at 19.3 percent.

According to the company, revenue growth was driven by the UK (17 percent QoQ), retail & consumer packaged goods (CPG) (13 percent QoQ) and life sciences and healthcare (12 QoQ percent).

The order book for the quarter stood at $10 billion with the total FY23 order book TCV (total contract value) coming in at $34 billion.

TCS will announce on April 12 its earnings for the three months ended March, a quarter marked by the collapse of California-based Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS.

Indian IT services companies are heavily dependent on the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) industry, which means that spending cuts and extended decision-making cycles at clients in this sector are likely to impact their revenue.

Kotak Institutional Equities notes that TCS has a 29 percent exposure to the banking and financial services.

The Tata Group company is expected to report 2.1 percent Quarter-on-Quarter (QoQ) revenue growth in rupee terms in the fourth quarter; net profit is expected to increase 6.2 percent QoQ.

Consolidated revenue is expected to come in at Rs 59,463 crore with a Year-on-Year increase of 17.5 percent, a poll of securities firms shows. Consolidated net profit is expected to increase 16 percent YoY to Rs 11,515 crore.

In Constant Currency (cc) terms, securities firms expect growth to range from 0.1 percent to 1.1 percent QoQ.

“We expect muted revenue growth for TCS over the next two quarters at 0.1% and 0.5% QoQ in CC terms due to delay in decision-making in its two most important geographies, North America and Continental Europe, which together account for roughly 70% of its overall revenues,” ICICI Securities analysts wrote.

Deal wins

The firm projects TCS to report 6.2 percent cc YoY growth in FY23 and expects demand to revive starting in September 2023 as postponed projects get executed along with cost optimization deals.

Analysts are divided on the deal flow for the quarter. JM Financial expects the Total Contract Value (TCV) to be lower sequentially because of the banking crisis resulting in lower deal closures. Asian Market Securities (AMSEC) projects strong deal wins of over $10 billion for the quarter.

“Deal flow is expected to remain strong with TCS likely to post USD 8.5bn TCV (supported by Phoenix, Telefonica, Bombardier deals),” wrote HDFC securities.

Management expects to deliver 25 percent Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) margin, i.e. +25 Basis Points (BPs) in the corresponding period of the previous financial year. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Margins

The analysts’ poll says EBIT is expected to grow 4.2 percent QoQ and 17.9 percent YoY to Rs 14,886 crore. EBIT Margin is expected to expand 50 BPs QoQ and stay flat on a yearly basis at 25 percent.

“We expect margins to improve by ~50 bps qoq led by improved utilization rates, lower subcontracting expenses, and easing of supply side pressure,” AMSEC analysts wrote.

Investors will closely follow management commentary on demand, updates on the banking and financial services vertical, clients’ tech budgets, details of the deal pipeline and wins, trends in the attrition rate and the outlook for margins.

An outgoing chief executive officer (CEO). A successor waiting in the wings. A crushing banking crisis -- the January-March quarter has been full of unexpected turns for the country’s biggest information technology (IT) services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).

TCS kick starts the fourth quarter IT earnings season on April 12. A source in the know said CEO-designate K Krithivasan too will be present at the presser even as current CEO and managing director (MD) Rajesh Gopinathan announces the Q4 performance.

The stage is set for Krithivasan to take over as TCS CEO, nearly six years after he was considered for the position alongside Gopinathan.

This TCS earnings call will be unlike any other in recent times, as discussions are expected to take an interesting turn amid anticipation for updates on organisational and business restructuring, a new BFSI head, navigating a global macro environment, hiring plans, and more.

Here are five key aspects to watch out for at the TCS earnings call:

Commentary on business strategy changes

Krithivasan, who was appointed as a the new CEO and MD-designate on March 16, has maintained that there won’t be any great organisational or strategic changes as he takes over and Gopinathan continues with the company still September. The company is also in talks with Gopinathan for further engagement in an advisory role.

However, sources told Moneycontrol that TCS’ organisational overhaul into four distinctive business groups unveiled in April 2022, categorising clients based on their journeys with TCS caused unrest for several senior leaders in the firm. Krithivasan who was then heading the global BFSI vertical reportedly kept his vertical out of these restructured units.

Gopinathan’s current tenure as CEO and MD was to end in 2027. So, his sudden resignation came as a shock. He said that the monotony of earnings for the past 40 quarters and doing the same thing every 13 weeks got the better of him and he wanted to move on to doing something new.

Girish Pai, Head of Research at Nirmal Bang, said in his note, “While the new CEO, K Krithivasan, has not indicated any radical change in strategy, we would wait to see if there are any minor tweaks to it (especially around the new corporate structure of addressing different sets of clients which was instituted a year back and was indicated to be ex-CEO, Rajesh Gopinathan’s idea).”

Impact of the banking crisis

Not just TCS, but rivals too will be tracked closely for any commentary on how the BFSI sector crisis will impact demand outlook and overall global client sentiments. This quarter was marked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and Signature Bank of the US, followed by Switzerland’s Credit Suisse and the likely impact on the sectors and industries dependent on it.

As of the quarter-ended December, BFSI accounted for over 38 percent of TCS’ revenue.

Pai said, “The commentary around BFSI will be keenly watched, as TCS has likely got the highest exposure in the Tier-1 set with large relationships developed over the decades in both, the US as well as Europe.”

According to analysts, while the collapse of these regional US-based banks won't have a direct impact on the Indian IT services firms, but there are some delays expected in decision making in the near term, for the next six months.

Revenue growth

According to a poll by CNBC TV18, overall growth for Q4 is expected to be less than in Q3 as uncertainty continues to prevail amidst a tough business environment. Quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) revenue growth estimates have varied from 0.1 percent to 1.7 percent.

Analysts estimate a muted revenue growth on QoQ basis, but TCS is likely to lead Tier-I IT companies in terms of growth reported.

“We expect muted revenue growth for TCS over the next two quarters at 0.1 percent and 0.5 percent QoQ in CC (constant currency) terms due to delay in decision-making in its two most important geographies, North America and Continental Europe, which together account for roughly 70 percent of its overall revenues,” analysts at ICICI Securities said in a note.

Analysts added, “We expect revival of demand starting September 2023 with postponed projects getting executed, along with cost optimisation deals.”

Meanwhile, analysts at Kotak Institutional Securities forecast a much higher QoQ revenue growth at 1.1 percent and 11.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) in CC terms. “Growth will likely be led by spending on cloud and digital programs, cost take-outs and wallet share/vendor consolidation gains. Exposure to impacted banking clients will not materially impact revenue growth in our view in the quarter,” the note said.

So far, the highest QoQ revenue growth estimate for Q4 has been from Nomura at 1.7 percent.

EBIT margins are likely to improve by 40-50 basis points (bps) QoQ from Q3’s 24.5 percent, according to estimates by analysts. Commentary on how the company reaches the pre-COVID margin range of 26-28 percent will be tracked.

Hiring updates

For the first time in the past 10 quarters, TCS reported a slowdown in net new quarterly employee addition at negative 2,197 in Q3FY23. Will there be further slowdown in employee addition, what will be the hiring targets and outlook as we move into FY24 – these will be key questions.

At TCS, attrition rates since the beginning of FY23, have continued to improve. TCS’ Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), Milind Lakkad, in the previous quarter said the drop in headcount addition was a “planned” move to improve utilisation rates. TCS, like its peers, had hired in large numbers in 2022.

Analysts forecast that in this quarter too, the hiring numbers will be controlled as it looks to improve margins and utilisation rates.

Commentary on large deal-wins

Irrespective of the global macro challenges, TCS continued to report large multi-year deal-wins last quarter. In February, TCS announced the extension partnership with United Kingdom-based client Phoenix Group in a $723-million deal. According to media reports, TCS is also set to close multiple deals worth $1 billion with British retailer Marks and Spencer (M&S).

While previously TCS had said that it will maintain a QoQ total contract value (TCV) of $7-9 billion, analysts estimate that the company might cross this band in Q4.

“We expect strong deal-wins of $10 bn+ for the quarter, assuming normal renewal component. We do not include TCV from (the) mega deal with BSNL that is likely to be signed with TCS. TCS' commentary on growth outlook will be keenly followed. TCS is expected to be a beneficiary of higher focus of enterprises on cost take-outs and core modernisation,” analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in their note.

Will this deal-win momentum continue, what’s the demand outlook for FY24 – these would be worth noting.

The January-March quarter was a period of intense action in India’s IT companies — several top-level exits and appointments, the banking crisis in the US and Europe, a worsening macroeconomic climate and uncertainty about budgets for the new fiscal — all plagued companies. Now, as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) kicks off the earnings season next week, here’s a primer on what will be watched for in the IT sector.

The Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) sector will be a key talking point this quarter following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank of the US, followed by Switzerland’s Credit Suisse. Though the Indian IT sector has limited exposure to these banks, the overall global sentiments and pressures on the sector will have an impact on the demand outlook.

Here are a few key factors to watch out for during the upcoming Q4 earning season:

Leadership changes

TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Tech Mahindra and Wipro, all reported top-level appointments and exits this quarter. The biggest shocker was the sudden resignation of TCS CEO and MD Rajesh Gopinathan. K Krithivasan, who was the global head for BFSI, contributing around 38 percent of TCS revenue, was appointed the new CEO.

Amidst the banking crisis, Infosys lost former president Mohit Joshi to Tech Mahindra, where he will be joining as the CEO and MD from December. Joshi was responsible for financial services and insurance segments, among other areas, and led many large deals for the company. This was the second major exit for Infosys in H2FY23, following the exit of president Ravi Kumar S who became the CEO of Cognizant.

“We await to see what happens to the positions vacated by Ravi Kumar (who has become Cognizant CEO) and Mohit Joshi (CEO designate of Tech Mahindra). Would wait to see if the responsibilities are filled internally,” Girish Pai, Head of Research, Nirmal Bang, said in his note.

Similarly, HCL Tech’s Corporate Vice President Sukamal Banerjee who led the $1-billion revenue vertical Engineering and R&D Services (ERS), besides global strategy and investments around emerging technology transformations, too resigned. Rajan Kohli, President of Wipro's Integrated Digital, Engineering and Applications Services Business lines quit as well.

How the commentary around these exits and appointments would shape up and any changes in the business strategies related to these appointments would be important to note.

Impact of banking crisis

“IT companies have mentioned increased cautiousness among clients around decision-making due to heightened uncertainty arising from the recent banking crisis. Deal pipelines have not shrunk, but conversion to new deal wins is taking longer time,” analysts at ICICI Securities said in a note.

Analysts expect near-term demand visibility to be weak, given the macro uncertainties and banking crisis. Among Tier-I IT companies, TCS has the highest exposure to the sector and will be closely watched for its commentary.

Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said, “The banking crisis in US regional banks and European banks can induce greater caution and impact overall tech spends by banking clients.”

The collateral damages to the economies due to the banking crisis and the impact on customer health are yet to be seen, Nirmal Bang said in a note.

Hiring trends

Hiring across companies is expected to be muted, as all of the top five companies have continued to slow down on hiring significantly in each quarter of the year. While Q4 hiring is usually in anticipation of the demand in the new financial year, there were no green shoots this quarter.

In fact, pressure on an already subdued quarter was only exacerbated by the banking crisis, with experts now stating that companies will focus on increasing their utilisation and only backfilling attrition in critical roles.

Companies have maintained that the slowdown in hiring is not a factor of demand, but the increased hiring they did in the preceding year. However, another metric to watch out for will be the number of freshers that companies aim to hire in FY24.

Analysts at Emkay Global expect moderation in hiring, with a focus on improving utilisation, deploying freshers post-training and demand moderation. “Better talent availability with significant fresher intake over the past few quarters and lower backfilling costs with reduced churn rate should aid in margin recovery,” the note read.

Onboarding of freshers hired in the previous year has still not been completed in some companies, and companies did go to top colleges they recruit from in the first round of placements. However, the second rung of colleges saw subdued demand from IT companies, which are some of the largest hirers of fresh talent.

“The full impact of the extraordinary hiring of fiscal 2022 was felt in fiscal 2023, because of which employee cost is estimated to rise by over 20 percent. Companies are now focussing on utilisation than advance hiring, supported by lower attrition. This should lead to marginal improvement in operating profitability in fiscal 2024,” said Aditya Jhaver, Director at CRISIL Ratings.

Revenue and PAT estimates

According to Crisil Ratings’ Anuj Sethi, headwinds in the BFSI segment of key markets, such as the US and Europe, will affect revenue growth this quarter.

“While BFSI segment revenue growth is expected to halve to mid-single digit, it would be marginally offset by 12-14 percent growth in the manufacturing segment and 9-11 percent growth in other segments. Net-net, there would be moderation in overall revenue growth,” he said.

Nirmal Bang too, expects revenue growth to be modest, attributing it to decent Total Contract Value (TCV) that companies clocked in the previous quarters.

Motilal Oswal expects most tier-1 companies’ revenues to grow, barring Tech Mahindra at negative 0.7 percent. It expects LTIMindtree to clock revenue growth of 1.6 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in constant currency terms, followed by TCS at 0.9 percent, Infosys and HCLTech at 0.6 percent, and Wipro at 0.5 percent.

Kotak has forecast a modest revenue growth guidance for FY24, which it says “may not be considered conservative due to elevated risks to growth and likely back-ended growth trajectory”.

On profitability for the quarter, Motilal Oswal expects profit after tax (PAT) to grow at 2.9 percent sequentially and 11.1 percent year-on-year (YoY) for tier-1 players. For tier-2, the note estimates a sequential PAT growth of 5.3 percent and 13 percent from the same period last year.

For fiscal 2023, Crisil expects operating profitability to moderate 150-175 basis points (bps) to a decadal low of 22-22.5 percent, due to higher employee costs. “Crisil Ratings expects these costs to moderate next fiscal, with companies taking a cautious approach to fresh hiring as they attempt to normalise headcount after the hiring peaks of fiscal 2022, which saw the employee count for Tier-I firms surge 22 percent,” it said.

For FY24, Crisil expects the sector to see a decline of 700-900 bps in revenue growth.

Demand outlook and tech trends

Impacted customer sectors will look to optimise existing cloud consumption spends. Vendor consolidation deals will also continue to increase.

Apart from the BFSI sector, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said, “the demand outlook of segments such as mortgages, hi-tech, and certain segments of retail and telecom is weak,” as enterprises in impacted segments will prioritise cost efficiencies.

Nirmal Bang’s Pai expects delays in decision-making, focus on cost optmisation and vendor consolidation to be the common themes across company commentaries for 4QFY23. “Seasonally, we think the October-March timeframe tends to be the peak in terms of order inflow for most companies and we expect that to repeat,” he said.

“The management (of IT firms) indicated that the secular demand is still intact in certain verticals and service lines, but suggested near-term caution among clients and some delays in decision-making, which might lead to project deferrals and pause in execution,” said a note from Motilal Oswal.

Moreover, for the customer sectors still open to discretionary tech spending, finding use cases around new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and 5G, will take centre-stage.

The recent banking crisis in the United States is expected to have an impact on the earnings of Indian information technology (IT) services companies in Q4FY23, with analysts pointing to weak sequential revenue growth. Despite prompt intervention by central banks, which appears to have contained the banking crisis for now, the risk of further disruption remains.

The banking crisis in the US played out from the beginning of March this year, when Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a lender to tech companies, especially start-ups, faced a run on its deposits and ultimately went under. Another US bank, Signature Bank, followed. A third bank, First Republic Bank, was given support. The biggest casualty was Switzerland’s Credit Suisse, which was taken over by UBS through a government-backed action.

Given Indian IT companies' heavy dependence on Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector for their revenue, IT related spending cuts and extended decision-making cycles implemented by clients in this segment are likely to impact the companies' top line.

Weak revenue growth

According to analysts at JM Financial, the immediate impact on IT services seems to be more on the elongated decision cycles than actual spending cuts. ""Recent ructions in the global banking space mean new project starts and the usual year-end flurry of deal closures might have been pushed out,"" they note. It believes that firms may land in the lower half of their guided Q4 band and assume their large-cap coverage universe (top-6) to report negative 0.6 percent to 1.2 percent constant currency (CC) quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) revenue growth.

ICICI Securities also warns that while deal pipelines have not shrunk, conversion to new deal wins is taking longer. In some cases, the conversion of order book to revenues in terms of deal ramp-ups is also taking longer than usual.

“This, in our view, implies right shifting/postponement of demand to H2FY24E or even FY25E as the digitalisation agenda of clients remains largely intact, but their near-term focus has shifted to cost optimisation and increasing efficiency,” it said, and expects revenue growth in the range of negative 1.9 percent (HCLT) to 0.5 percent (LTIM) in CC terms.

Higher BFSI exposure companies such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro, LTIMindtree, Coforge and Mphasis will need to be closely monitored to understand the impact of the banking crisis on their revenues, going forward, according to Asian Market Securities (Amsec). The adverse impact of IT-related spending cuts should primarily be on discretionary spends, it says, and believes that cost optimisation and vendor consolidation-related spends should remain the prime focus over the next three to four quarters. It projects large companies to report revenue growth in the narrow range of negative 1.6 percent to 1.1 percent QoQ in CC terms, and mid-tier companies to have a wider growth band in the range of negative 5 percent to 5 percent QoQ in CC.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal predicts its IT services coverage universe to deliver a median revenue growth of 0.8 percent QoQ and 9.2 percent YoY in CC terms in Q4FY23. Apart from BFSI, Hi-Tech, Manufacturing and Retail may also report muted growth in Q4, it added.

Margin relief

While a weak macro is expected to impact Q4FY23 revenue growth, margins can see some improvement on the back of easing supply pressure, cooling off attrition, and improvements in utilisation, according to the brokerage.

“Tier-I companies should post flat margins, with HCLT (down 150 bpd QoQ on P&P (products and platforms) seasonality) and LTIM (up 180 bps QoQ due to recovery from Q3 low base) being the exceptions. The Tier-II pack will post a wider range of flat to 200 bps QoQ, led by Coforge/Zent with margin improvement of 200 bps/120 bps QoQ,” it said.

JM Financial sees slower growth and falling attrition to limit the efficacy of traditional margin levers and projects a muted margin performance ((80)-20 bps QoQ) for the top 5 players.

“TCS is likely to miss its FY23 exit margin target of 25% while TechM’s margin recovery will likely get pushed out further. LTIMindtree’s Q4 margins, +150 bps, will benefit from lack of one-off merger-related cost, but will still be significantly below normalised levels. Coforge should report the highest margin expansion in our coverage universe (+170 bps; adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)) as it pulls up operating levers to achieve its FY23 margin guidance,” it said.

Amsec, on the other hand, expects margins to benefit from easing of supply side pressure and improved utilisation rates. They believe that the difference between margins of mid-tier and large-tier companies will now blur as favourable supply side dynamics will have an almost equal positive flow-through across companies.

Tier-1 vs Tier-2

Cost take-out and vendor consolidation deals are witnessing increase where we believe Tier-1 companies are better positioned to gain market share versus Tier-II companies, it added. The stock broking firm prefers Infosys, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra in large-cap players.

“We expect Infosys to continue to deliver top robust revenue growth, amid strong deal wins and market share gains, the difference in growth vs TCS narrowing though. At the current valuations of 16xFY25E, we believe HCL Tech is attractively priced. TechM is also trading at attractive valuations of 13.6xFY25E EPS, with expectations of upside risks to FY25E numbers with the new CEO bringing in some positive changes.” In Tier-2, it prefers Cyient, Firstsource and Birlasoft due to their high earnings growth trajectory and comfort on valuations.

Motilal Oswal also prefers Tier-I players over Tier-II counterparts, given the former’s attractive valuations, increased traction in vendor consolidation and diversified client portfolios.

Among Tier-I players, it prefers HCL Tech, and Infosys along with TCS. “TCS remains best positioned to benefit from long-term structural tailwinds in tech services and should see a relative pick-up in growth, aided by clients’ focus on cost optimisation and efficiencies. HCLT is one of the key beneficiaries of Cloud adoption at scale, given its expertise in IMS. We expect Infosys to deliver a strong growth, backed by strong deal wins.” In Tier-2, the brokerage leans towards Cyient and Zensar Technologies.

Brokerage firm ICICI Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on TCS, Infosys and LTIM in large-cap, and Mphasis amongst mid-cap players.

1. Supreme Court says banks must hear borrowers before classifying any account as fraud

The Supreme Court has upheld a December 2020 Telangana high court order that said a borrower must be given a hearing by the lender before an account is classified as fraud. Since the classification of a fraud account entails serious civil consequences for the borrower, the directions must be construed reasonably and follow the principles of natural justice, the apex court also said.

Why it’s important: The Reserve Bank in 2016 had allowed banks to classify accounts of willful defaulters as fraudulent without hearing them. Bankers would be worried that the latest order will lengthen the process of declaring a fraud account and reopen many older cases.

2. Domestic mutual funds resume lump-sum contributions to overseas equity plans

Domestic mutual fund houses have resumed accepting lump-sum contributions to their international equity plans after the latest rule change removed tax advantages for debt-oriented saving plans from April 1. At least three asset management companies have opened 16 international equity mutual fund programs for lump-sum investments up to the amounts legally permissible. The new amendments, applicable from 2023-24, will remove indexation benefits for debt-oriented savings plans.

Why it’s important: The new international equity plans may now become the norm in this particular investment option because onshore plans that invest in overseas markets are treated as debt funds locally for taxation purposes.

3. State-run banks may not pay dividend to government to conserve capital

Public sector banks may ask the government to allow them to not pay it a dividend as they look to conserve capital before the expected loss-based approach for loan loss provisioning kicks in from April 1, 2025. At present, banks make provisions on incurred loss, that is, once an account is overdue for more than 90 days, they set aside capital, known as provision. In January, the Reserve Bank released a discussion paper on the expected loss-based approach for loan loss provisioning.

Why it’s important: The finance ministry had asked state-owned banks to conduct a study on the impact of such a norm on their capital position. The new model may erode their capital position.

4. Creditors to Reliance Capital to go ahead with second auction on April 4

The lenders of Reliance Capital have decided to go ahead with the second round of auction on April 4 despite the Hinduja group retracting its revised bid. The Hinduja group had submitted a higher bid of Rs 9,000 crore on December 21, a day after the first round of auction in which rival Torrent Group had been declared the highest bidder. Torrent had bid for Rs 8,640 crore, while Hinduja had originally offered Rs 8,110 crore. It has now reverted back to its lower bid.

Why it’s important: The committee of creditors will be disappointed by the surprising reversal that has diminished their chances of maximizing recoveries. It will be interesting to see how this play out.

5. Supreme Court upholds quashing of allegations against three Adani Group firms

The Supreme Court has dismissed a petition filed by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence challenging the orders issued last year by the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal to quash the cases pertaining to over-invoicing allegations levelled by the agency against three Adani Group subsidiaries. Between November 2022 and January 2023, the central agency had moved the Supreme Court against the relief granted to Adani Power Maharashtra, Adani Power Rajasthan and Maharashtra Eastern Grid Power Transmission Company by the tribunal.

Why it’s important: The Hindenburg report that alleged accounting fraud at Adani Group firms had mentioned this investigation by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence. Adani had denied wrongdoing.

6. Government may sell remaining stake in Bharat Aluminium in next financial year

More than two decades since the privatization of Bharat Aluminium Company, the government is preparing to sell its remaining stake in the firm in the next fiscal year. The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management has been asked for a road map for the stake sale. The government may sell the stake in an auction or sell it in tranches. It may also decide to retain some equity, the quantum of which will be decided once the roadmap is finalized. The government had sold 51 per cent stake in Balco to Sterlite Industries, a unit of Vedanta, as part of its privatization in 2001.

Why it’s important: The sale of the remaining 41 per cent stake did not took off due to a lack of clarity over the valuation of shares and the rights of the majority shareholder. Those issues could now be resolved.

7. Tata Consultancy starts screening candidates for reorganization of top management

Tata Consultancy Services will go for widespread reorganization of its top leadership, including the positions of chief technology officer and chief operating officer, with top two executives set to retire over the next one year. India’s biggest software services exporter will also pick a new head for its banking, financial services and insurance division. Four to five candidates are being evaluated to fill the position vacated by CEO-designate K Krithivasan.

Why it’s important: The company’s chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan resigned abruptly last month. That development and near retirement of other senior executives has prompted the firm to accelerate its succession planning.

8. State-run oil marketers to get Rs 800 crore to set up fast-charging stations

The central government has sanctioned Rs 800 crore under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles scheme to three public sector oil-marketing companies to set up 7,432 public fast-charging stations across the country. In the first instalment, the heavy industries ministry has released 70 per cent (Rs 560 crore) of the money to Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, and Hindustan Petroleum for installation and commissioning of upstream infrastructure and charging equipment of electric vehicle public charging stations at respective retail outlets.

Why it’s important: The subsidy to oil marketers will provide another push for green mobility. As sale of electric vehicles pick up, there would be increasing demand for charging stations.

9. Coca-Cola bets heavily on rural demand for chilled drinks as infrastructure improves

Coca-Cola Company is investing significantly in India along with its bottling partners as rural electrification and falling poverty open up new markets for its beverages in the country’s hinterland. “The infrastructure development that’s taking place in a systemic way across India is a key driver. A specific point in the case of India is electrification, and how that has transformed the landscape not only in large cities and towns, but (also) in the rural parts of India,” said John Murphy, president and chief financial officer at Coca-Cola. “It’s extraordinary progress that’s underway.”

Why it’s important: India is at an inflection point with its rapidly developing infrastructure. Rural electrification helps Coca-Cola sell chilled drinks by installing chillers in stores.

10. Viacom18 may earn more than Disney Star from ad revenues from Indian Premier League

Days ahead of the start of the Indian Premier League, Disney Star, which retained the TV rights for the tournament, is locking horns with Viacom18, which won the league’s digital rights, to grab a larger share of the Rs 4,500 crore advertising pie. Disney Star is hoping to garner between Rs 2,000 crore and Rs 2,400 crore in ad revenues. However, Media planners expect Viacom18 to grab nearly a 60 per cent share of the ad pie, which is expected to remain at the same levels as last year.

Why it’s important: If Viacom18 is able to garner higher revenues than Disney Star, it would mean a major shift in advertising earnings from television to digital channels.",1279,-0.12879757447676224

The series of events in the banking sector in the US and Europe in the last few days can impact the Indian IT services companies as clients are spooked currently, experts said. At roughly 40 percent, the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) vertical makes up a significant portion of the revenue of Indian IT companies, according to NASSCOM’s 2023 Strategic Review report. The current crisis is an additional cause for concern for companies, which are already under stress in a harsh demand environment and macroeconomic climate.

There will be a slowdown in deals and decision-making delays in the near term, at least for the next six months, experts said. But they remain cautious as the situation continues to develop.

According to Phil Fersht, CEO and founder of HFS Research, there is a situation of panic among many clients. “The volatility and uncertainty are going to slow down decisions on deals as banks observe how the current crisis period shapes out. This may lead to short-term engagements in critical areas that cannot be put away, such as cybersecurity compliance and finalising app modernisation projects,” he told Moneycontrol.

Banks in the news recently such as Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, Credit Suisse, and UBS are all clients of various IT companies.

Fersht said that he expects spending to stay relatively strong with the large banks, particularly in the present situation as HSBC takes over SVB UK and UBS takes over Credit Suisse. “There will be a lot more consolidation which will lead to a lot of IT services needs. The mid-tier will be soft as many banks struggle with high interest rates and trust issues with customers,” he said.

Limited exposure to problem banks

Mukul Garg, an IT analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said the Indian IT sector doesn’t have high exposure to Credit Suisse. “There might be some exposure to large-cap ones like Infosys, HCLTech but I don’t think it is large enough for them,” he says.

The current situation, he said, is likely to cause near-term pressure on spending by US and European banks if it exacerbates.

“We are still viewing how this scenario is developing, it is very recent. The impact will mostly be limited till March for IT services companies. There will be some impact on their revenue in Q4, but beyond that, we don’t have a lot of visibility in terms of whether the impact will persist. There is some concern but it will not structurally impact IT companies unless contagion spreads further,” he told Moneycontrol.

As per a recent note by JP Morgan, US regional bank exposure is the most at TCS and Infosys at less than 2-3 percent of revenue. It also estimated that the exposure to Silicon Valley Bank is 10-20 bps for TCS, Infosys, and LTIMindtree.

A LTIMindtree spokesperson told Moneycontrol that company's exposure to the impacted banks is immaterial. The company overall gets 37.4 percent of its revenue from the BFSI vertical.

“We wish to share that despite the volatility in the global financial markets following the banking crisis, LTIMindtree’s exposure to impacted institutions is immaterial. We do not foresee any impact on our financials. We continue to work closely with our clients and monitor the developments on the ground,” the spokesperson said.

Softening of tech spends

According to the JPMorgan note, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and concerns about liquidity across the US and the European Union can soften tech spends by banks in the short term. According to the note, it can lead to delays in ramp-ups, which can impact revenue conversion in the next 1-2 quarters and delays in deal closures that will impact revenues over the next 3-4 quarters. “We have already heard about slowing revenue conversion in 4Q and slowing deal signing before the events that kicked off SVB’s collapse,” the note said.

Fersht said that several Indian companies have “deep business footprints in BFS”.

“For example, TCS and Infosys are exposed to US regional banks. Wipro’s acquisition of Capco, a BFS specialist, could cause some issues. Other Indian-heritage providers such as HCL, Mphasis, UST, Hexaware, and Virtusa are heavily dependent on the BFS sector and will be watching closely. Cognizant’s dependence on BFS has lessened in recent years, which may be a blessing in disguise,” he said.

Nomura said in a note last week that SVB is a small customer of TCS, and the company works with most of the large regional and central banks. Softening of spending and decision-making in US BFSI was already there, even before SVB’s problems surfaced, it said. Infosys, on the other hand, said it works with 8 of the 10 largest US banks, has “no meaningful exposure to US regional banks”, and expects client spends for CY23 to be impacted. Wipro, according to the note, “thinks the larger impact from the recent volatility in the global BFSI sector would emerge only with a lag.""

According to Kotak Institutional Equities, caution among BFS firms in developed markets, following Silvergate, SVB, Signature Bank and the acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS is expected to lead to further curtailing of discretionary tech spends in the near term. Kotak said that there can be a pause in the pace of digital or cloud programs due to a cut in discretionary spending in the near term.

Slowdown?

Fersht said that the next six months are going to be tough, with many decisions put off.

“However, once trust in the financial systems is restored, 2024 should see strong growth as many BFS firms cannot afford to keep delaying IT projects. Many BFS firms have no choice but to modernise their legacy cores to survive in the digital environment,” he said.

Kotak expects a growth slowdown in FY24, with sequential growth expected to be impacted by 1-2 percent in Q1.

Kotak noted that post the global financial crisis in 2008, Indian IT players benefited from captive takeover deals and that similar opportunities might come up in the second half of FY24. This could benefit service providers with strong capabilities across services and mandates.

The note added that on a pro forma basis, UBS and Credit Suisse spend roughly $7 billion on technology, and would look for “upfront cost saves by eliminating redundancies in tech stack as part of their plan to rationalise the over CHF 8 billion annual cost run-rate by CY2027.”

The company indicated that cost savings of CHF 2 billion would be from the integration of IT systems. “M&A of such scale provides significant opportunities for service providers to sign deals with long-term annuity revenue streams, while also consolidating out the long tail of vendors,” Kotak said.

Wait and watch

A note by Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities said that it is unclear how things will play out, and going by the actions of the DM central banks, it looks like the damage has been contained for now. “If US regional bank problems are not sorted out quickly there is going to be a spillover effect on the US economy that would then have a direct impact on the IT spend by large US corporations,” the note said, adding that the BFSI sector will likely be an area of stress in FY24.

Gaurav Vasu, founder and CEO of IT market intelligence firm UnearthInsight, told Moneycontrol that the challenge for IT services companies is primarily about the current situation spreading to other banks.

“In the short run, there will be delays in banking contracts, a lot of the short-term and mid-term automation, cloud optimisation and modernisation kind of contracts, cybersecurity projects etc will see a slowdown. In the short run, till Q2, there will be a 20-30 bps decline in revenue of the BFSI sector overall,” he said.

He added that the impact in Q4 will be seen in companies directly related to Credit Suisse and SVB.

Queries sent to TCS, Infosys, LTIMindtree and Tech Mahindra were unanswered at the time of publishing.

“Macroeconomic developments are visible across the US and Europe and we are closely monitoring the situation. The majority of our exposure is to large banks, which are well capitalised,” Wipro told Moneycontrol in a statement.

Where will the spending be?

According to Mrinal Rai, principal analyst at ISG, spending in the BFSI space was geared more towards business process outsourcing than in IT. He added that spending is likely to be higher in the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) space.

Rai added that the annual contract value (ACV) for IT was trending downwards in the BFSI space. “Spending is more on the strategic side of it and when clients — not just in BFSI — analyse how technology will help them sustain in the business and how it can help strategically improve, they do spend on technologies on the business side. You may not see the regular IT service providers, somebody managing only say cloud or networks or data centre kind of deals, those deals will reduce but work that involves core banking services or GRC, payment processing, etc., in those kinds of things, spending is likely to be more.”",1531,-0.6982442736625671

During that event, it became clear that the top bosses in the Tata group were displeased with the pace at which the software company was growing its topline. Revenue growth was flagging and that point became obvious during the discussions involving senior executives, three people aware of the development said.

Weeks later, on the evening of March 16, 2023, TCS informed stock exchanges that Gopinathan decided to step down. K Krithivasan, Global Head-BFSI (Banking, Financial Services and Insurance), the largest and most important vertical in terms of revenue at TCS, would succeed him as CEO. Gopinathan will continue until September 15, 2023 to help with the transition.

Tata Sons and TCS did not offer comments for this article.

To say Gopinathan’s exit was shocking would be to put it mildly. TCS has long taken great pride in the stability of its leadership.

Unlike its rivals Infosys and Wipro, which were roiled by turbulent CEO appointments and exits, the Tata group company has had just four CEOs in its 55-year history. And all of them were TCS lifers who spent decades at the firm.

In February 2017, Gopinathan succeeded N Chandrasekaran as TCS CEO, as the latter assumed the role of Chairman of Tata Sons. Chandra, who was named TCS CEO in 2009, hand-picked Gopinathan for the CFO role in 2013. An engineer and MBA by training, Gopinathan had also worked closely with Chandra on organisational design and strategy.

Gopinathan’s departure was also a shocker because he was reappointed as TCS CEO for a five-year term until February 2027 only a year ago. It is rare for CEOs to quit when they have four years left in the tenure.

The timing could not have been worse. His exit also comes amid worsening macros in the US, the biggest technology market and the crisis of confidence that has gripped the US banking system in the aftermath of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank.

According to JP Morgan analysts, TCS and Infosys have the highest exposure to regional banks in the United States and may need to set aside provisions due to their exposure to SVB.

Industry analysts also expect the SVB collapse to result in enterprise clients pushing their IT spending decisions, leading to longer sale cycles and delay the actual budget cycle for 2023.

Fatigue from 40 quarters

While stakeholders were still scrambling for answers, the company implied that monotony and the earnings rigmarole got the better of its CEO.

TCS Investor Relations head Kedar Shirali sent a Whatsapp message to equity analysts minutes after the announcement, seeking to assuage their concerns.

The message read, ""Rajesh told me that last quarter he realized that he had been doing the same thing for 40 quarters, getting on to the conference call bridge every 13 weeks and getting grilled by you. And that he'd been asking himself when's a good time to find something new to do. After discussing with Chandra, he decided that this was the best time to pull the trigger.”

The next day, Gopinathan and Krithivasan addressed journalists.

Gopinathan is usually reticent and unflappable at press meets and analyst calls. On that day, he was unrestrained. “It's an odd day today but I am happy to announce that I am stepping down after 22 years with TCS. I can’t tell you how happy and light I feel,” he said.

The writing on the wall

While external stakeholders and TCS watchers were taken by surprise, insiders Moneycontrol spoke to said the move has been brewing for some time now.

A confluence of factors, importantly an organisational restructuring exercise, finally precipitated Gopinathan’s resignation.

Horror recast

At a time when Accenture and Infosys were snapping at its heels, TCS unveiled an organisational overhaul in April 2022. The company divided clients into four distinctive business groups depending on a client’s journey with it instead of verticals and geographies.

These were the acquisition group, relationship incubation group, enterprise group and finally business transformation group. While the previous restructuring saw TCS creating 23 unit heads tasked with running a $250 million business each, the new structure split the company into units based on the revenue grouping.

“I found the reorg funny. You are essentially grouping this based on revenue size, with the guy at the end of the food chain likely to benefit the most as the client keeps moving from one group to the next,” another executive familiar with the development said.

In other words, the upshot of the revamp was that a TCS executive would be loath to take ownership of an account because of the likelihood of it going out of their hands once it becomes big. This caused unrest among senior executives.

It was also complex to execute. For instance, the accounts below $10 million followed a horizontal structure, the ones between $10-100 million a vertical structure and the ones above had a mix of vertical and horizontal. ""It was confusing on who would take ownership of a client,"" the executive cited above said.

Another executive said the structure would never work for a domain-specific industry like IT. “If I am running a unit with two large insurance clients, I can win smaller clients on the back of that expertise. Here, people in the acquisition group will be stuck and can never scale to a bigger client. And winning the account the first time is usually the toughest part of the journey,” he said.

Many people in TCS harboured the same feelings. One of the sources cited above said CEO designate Krithivasan, who ran the biggest vertical within the company, too was not in favour of the horizontal structure.

So much so that his vertical was completely kept out of it. ""Krithi kept the BFSI vertical out of the redesign,"" at least two sources confirmed to Moneycontrol.

Empathy factor

“Whenever people had an issue they would go to NGS (COO N Ganapathy Subramaniam) or N Chandra. Rajesh has amazing intellectual horsepower but he doesn’t suffer fools,” one of the sources cited above said.

This trait might have served him well as a CFO. But as a CEO he had to persuade the leadership team, and take the entire organisation along. And those qualities became a weakness as a CEO.

The same person added that Krithivasan is “high on empathy” and a “consensus builder.” Attributes that will help him as he gears up to manage a company with over 600,000 employees.

In fact, Krithivasan was a front-runner for the CEO role even in 2017, given he ran the largest portfolio and grew it in a consistent manner.

Growth pangs

TCS’ growth too was underwhelming compared with rivals such as Accenture and Infosys.

Under N Chandra, TCS was on a strong wicket, heaving the company to leadership in various domains and geographies. TCS was nimble, gaining from early investments in digital, products and platforms. Under his leadership, TCS had generated consolidated revenues of US$16.5 billion in 2015-16.

To be sure, Gopinathan built on these strengths, with TCS delivering consistent performance under his watch.

In the last six years, TCS added more than $10 billion in incremental revenues and saw an over $70 billion increase in market capitalisation.

It has a revenue run rate of $28 billion, with industry-leading margins.

Nonetheless, TCS seems to have lost sheen compared with its larger rival Accenture and smaller rival Infosys.

For instance, Accenture, which is more than double the revenue base of TCS, has been growing faster than the latter in the past three years. Infosys’ revenues grew faster than TCS for the past three financial years in a row. To be sure, TCS also has a higher base compared with Infosys.

An industry executive said Gopinathan is very sharp intellectually and is a brilliant strategist who can think through complex problems. But will he go out of his way to meet customers and swing deals?

“Rajesh was a reluctant traveller and also hierarchical in terms of choosing whom to meet. He didn’t want to live out of a suitcase,” this executive said, asking not to be named.

Another person familiar with TCS’ operations said Gopinathan was too focussed on financials, at a time when competitors were winning large deals, even if that meant sacrificing margins.

Unlike N Chandra and Krithivasan, who spent decades in client-facing roles, Gopinathan was steeped in finance for a significant part of his tenure—in functions such as Business Finance and CFO, before he became CEO.

First among equals

“Normally, a new CEO appointment leads to the exit of disappointed front-runners. While exits are possible, it must be pointed out that Krithivasan was a clear front-runner in case Rajesh ever wished to step down,” a Kotak note by Kawaljeet Saluja, head of research, said.

His career trajectory at TCS has many parallels with that of N Chandra, who also graduated from the Coimbatore Institute of Technology.

Just like Chandra, he learned the business and operations of the company ground-up, having worked in delivery, pre-sales, sales and large client groups.

According to the people Moneycontrol spoke to, over the years, Krithivasan has built a reputation for his chops in execution.

“Krithi has a very strong track record leading the BFSI business and has 34 years in TCS. He will be a very solid presence to take things forward for the firm. He bleeds TCS, and knows the firm from top to bottom, with deep respect from his peers and staff,"" said Phil Fersht, Founder and Chief Analyst of HFS Research.",1602,0.03946132245271102

Top TCS executive K Krithivasan has been picked to take over as CEO, marking a big leadership change for one of the world's most valuable companies. Krithivasan will succeed Rajesh Gopinathan, who announced his resignation earlier this week after a 22-year stint with the IT giant.

Krithivasan, 57, has been a part of TCS for 34 years. He is at present the global head of the TCS' core Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) Business Group.

But how is he like in life outside TCS? Humble and kind, his co-workers and friends say.

He is an avid reader and has been studying Sanskrit for years. He likes running and being with his friends and family in his spare time.

The incoming TCS boss is from Chennai and but will now have to relocate to Mumbai.

The move seems more challenging for Krithivasan as compared to his upcoming job itself, the CEO-designate said during a press conference. “Leaving Chennai is a tough decision. People that know the culture will know.”

Krithivasan was born in Tiruchirappalli and went on to attend college in Chennai. He earned a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering degree from the University of Madras.

He completed his post-graduation in Industrial and Management Engineering from the IIT Kanpur.

Krithivasan joined TCS in 1989, as the Executive Vice President

""During his long tenure at TCS, he has held various leadership roles in delivery, customer relationship management, large program management and sales,"" the company said. ""He has played a key role in helping BFSI customers with digital transformations, change management cycle acceleration, value delivery, technology strategy and governance.

Krithivasan will be supported in his job transition by Gopinathan, who will stay on till September 15, 2023.

""I am confident that he is best positioned to take TCS to greater heights along with the leadership team,"" Gopinathan said about his successor. ""I will be working closely with Krithi to give him all the support that he needs.”",353,-0.2831374804178874

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) CEO Rajesh Gopinathan was leading an already stable and steady company and transitioning to a new CEO won’t change much for the company or its business, said industry experts and analysts, while still coming to terms with the biggest top-level exit at the country’s largest IT services firm.

K Krithivasan’s appointment as the new TCS CEO is the third major CEO announcement of 2023 at a top IT services firm, and comes on the heels of Mohit Joshi being appointed as the next CEO and MD of Tech Mahindra and Ravi Kumar S taking over the top job at Cognizant (Joshi and Kumar are both former Infosys presidents). TCS, however, prefers to pick its CEO candidates internally.

During his six-year tenure as the CEO, Gopinathan steered the company through the years of the pandemic and then the ongoing macroeconomic challenges. New CEO Krithivasan will have to lead growth in a strong company amid choppy waters, said industry analysts. Prior to becoming CEO, Krithivasan was the president and Global Head of the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) Business Group, a vertical that contributes around 35-40 percent of TCS’s revenue.

Read: Who is K Krithivasan? The newly-appointed CEO of TCS

According to a note by Kotak Institutional Equities, Krithivasan is well qualified for the role. “He handles a large BFSI portfolio of $11 billion, has grown the business consistently, involved in many strategic decisions and was among front-runners for the CEO role.”

“He’s had a lot of success with large deals, productisation, and delighting customers. I think the board was looking for someone who was a practitioner,” Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research, said.

Why Krithivasan?

This isn’t the first time Krithivasan is being considered for the CEO role at TCS, where he has spent his entire career of 34 years. In fact, he was one of the top contenders along with Gopinathan in 2017 too, when a successor was being chosen for the then CEO N Chandrasekaran.

“Normally, a new CEO appointment leads to the exit of disappointed front-runners. While exits are possible, it must be pointed out that Krithivasan was a clear front-runner in case Rajesh ever wished to step down,” the Kotak note by Kawaljeet Saluja, head of research, said.

His career trajectory at TCS has many parallels with that of Chandrasekaran, who is now the Tata Group chairman. Krithivasan, like Chandrasekaran, holds a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the Coimbatore Institute of Technology.

At TCS, just like Chandrasekaran, he learned the business and operations of the company ground-up, having worked in delivery, pre-sales, sales etc.

According to sources, over the years, Krithivasan has built a reputation for being great at execution. While Gopinathan is an intellectual, a brilliant thinker and strategic leader, Krithivasan can execute any blueprint, they said.

Within the company, Krithivasan is also known for being straightforward and understated but having high empathy as a leader. He has the ability to take his team along and build a consensus — a critical quality for a leader, especially in the services business, sources said.

“Krithi has a very strong track record leading the BFSI business and has 34 years in TCS. He will be a very solid presence to take things forward for the firm. He bleeds TCS, and knows the firm from top to bottom, with deep respect from his peers and staff, said Phil Fersht, Founder and Chief Analyst of HFS Research.

“While Rajesh will be missed, I am certain there will not be any issues with Krithi’s leadership — he is very much a part of the culture and this spells continuity as opposed to any disruption for TCS,” Fersht added.

Chirajeet Sengupta, Partner, global technology services, at consulting firm Everest Group, said that TCS has a very strong leadership bench and Krithivasan is a very credible leader.

“What will be interesting to see is how he shapes TCS in his own vision or whether he simply continues what Rajesh and team have been doing. But overall, we are very bullish on Krithi's appointment. He’s well-liked, well-respected, and well-known by clients. He's been in the trenches. He's been with clients for pretty much his entire career,” noted Sengupta. “Rajesh was the CFO becoming a CEO, whereas Krithi has been a business unit leader. I think that is an important distinction to make when you think of somebody becoming the CEO of an organisation.”

A note by Motilal Oswal said that given Krithivasan’s leadership of the unified BFSI vertical since 2017, “he is unlikely to face external questions on client relationships that Mr Gopinathan faced as CFO of TCS in 2017”.

Gopinathan’s journey

All the analysts Moneycontrol spoke to had a consensus on one thing, that TCS is a well-oiled machine and will not be impacted by this sudden change. It was the same when Gopinathan took over the reins from Chandrasekaran in 2017.

Though Gopinathan’s tenure wasn’t as exciting as the turnaround story of Salil Parekh at Infosys, he continued to drive steady growth and bring in large deals.

“The six years of Gopinathan’s tenure have been good. TCS added over $10 billion in revenue during this period,” said Pareekh Jain, Founder and CEO, EIIRTrend. “Especially in this phase of growth, where the macro environment has been tough, they are winning large deals; they have achieved speed and scale both. TCS has been the bellwether of the industry.”

“Comparing Infosys and TCS will be difficult. Infosys was a turnaround story and TCS was a continuity story. TCS was already doing well, Gopinathan had to build on that and double the scale. But whatever role he was in, he performed well, and dealt with two crises during his tenure,” Jain added.

Fersht concurred, adding that Gopinathan kept the ship sailing during the worst of the pandemic and oversaw some exciting deals for the firm, especially recent wins such as the Phoenix Group and Boeing.

Everest’s Sengupta said that he has to give credit to Gopinathan for steering TCS through a very turbulent period. “He's clearly created a lot of shareholder value. And particularly during difficult times, steering a company like TCS in the turbulence of Covid,” he said.

He pointed out that Gopinathan had restructured the company, a move that has given mixed results so far. While the intention was to ensure that clients of all sizes got the right amount of attention, navigating TCS at that scale became more complicated, and there has been a complicated transition to the new organisational structure, Sengupta added.

Fersht noted that the company was successfully restructured to “to blend consulting, technology, data and business services to address clients' broader needs head-on with a portfolio approach”.

According to Fersht, Gopinathan resisted making acquisitions and remained focused on growing TCS organically, through strategic client acquisitions and aggressive recruiting, rather than taking the firm in new radical directions. “TCS has a strong identity and persona that gives many clients trust in engaging with them, and that has only been strengthened under Rajesh’s stewardship. He leaves the firm in amazing shape and ready for the choppy waters that are coming this year,” he said.

According to HDFC Securities’ Deputy Vice-President Amit Chandra, Gopinathan’s business strategies have been quite good. “He revived the Europe business quite well and gained a lot of market share initially from Capgemini in 2017-18 and prior to Covid,” Chandra told Moneycontrol.

Chandra, however, added that though growth has been steady, it has not been extraordinary. “In the last six years, TCS grew at an 8 percent CAGR, Infosys at 9 percent, Wipro at 6 percent and Tech Mahindra at 7 percent. Performance-wise TCS has mostly been in line with the industry growth, which was about 8 percent. It has not been something extraordinary,” he said.

Motilal Oswal said that while TCS’ growth has trailed peers such as Infosys recently, the company has handled external pressures, including a transition to digital delivery and the impact of the Covid pandemic, relatively well despite its size.

Sudden exit

In an interview with Moneycontrol in January, Gopinathan recalled his experience attending at least 40 earnings calls since 2013, first as the chief financial officer and then as the CEO and MD.

“I don’t know where 10 years have flown by, quarter after quarter. One thing that remains predictable is the intensity of each quarter. I keep joking that between a disaster quarter and a great quarter, the level of tolerance is 50 bps. So, it’s amazing how much we track on a narrow basis. But overall it has been great and no surprises is the best thing,” he said.

In a WhatsApp message sent to equity analysts shortly after the announcement, TCS Investor Relations head Kedar Shirali said Gopinathan had implied he was tired of the treadmill. The message read: “Rajesh told me that last quarter he realized that he had been doing the same thing for 40 quarters, getting on to the conference call bridge every 13 weeks and getting grilled by you. And that he’d been asking himself when’s a good time to find something new to do. After discussing with Chandra, he decided that this was the best time to pull the trigger.”",1576,0.50263846438864

The IT services sector, which has already been suffering in the past year due to the uncertain global environment, is still not out of the woods as the macro environment continues to be turbulent, with analysts remaining cautious about the sector.

The benchmark Nifty IT index has declined 20 percent in the last year, compared to the broader Nifty50 index, which is up around 0.21 percent.

What do brokerages say

According to foreign brokerage Nomura, the demand uncertainty is rising and margins have bottomed out, with concerns around uncertain macro conditions, falling attrition and disciplined mergers and acquisitions.

The brokerage has a ""buy"" rating on Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Persistent Systems and Coforge. However, it recommends ""reduce"" on Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), LTIMindtree (LTIM) and L&T Technologies.

Morgan Stanley (MS), on the other hand, is bullish on LTIM and prefers Infosys and HCL Technologies. It has an 'underweight' rating on Wipro, L&T Tech and Tata Elxsi.

According to MS, macro concerns could lead to correction of stocks in near term.

The macro environment remains in a flux, clouding near-term revenue outlook and it believes that growth should normalise on a two-year basis. The brokerage cautions on FY24 outlook, with the expected stock volatility in the near term. “Would use that as an opportunity to accumulate,” it added.

Early last week, Jefferies said, “Among companies, consensus revenue growth estimates for CY24 have been lowered for top clients of all IT firms, barring Wipro, with the highest cuts of 80-180bps for HCLT & TechM. Additionally, profitability pressures are visible in CY24 as well, with aggregate margin/PAT estimates for top clients being revised downwards by 30bps/3 percent. Downward revisions in CY24 estimates suggests that concerns are now shifting towards CY24.”

The brokerage sees Coforge, Wipro and LTIM at high risk and believes Infosys, TCS, and HCL are better placed. “With sector valuations at 23x, we remain selective, with Infosys our only top pick,” it said.

On Wipro and LTIM, the brokerage said that while consensus expects limited deceleration in their revenue growth, a larger deceleration in the growth of their top clients is expected. For Coforge, the consensus revenue growth in FY24 is lower than the growth expected for its top clients.

“Infosys/TCS appear better placed on this front and the outlook of their clients seems to be improving as well. HCLT also looks well positioned as consensus expects HCLT's clients to see growth acceleration in FY24. TechM's expectations of growth moderation seem to be in sync with those of its clients, suggesting limited risk to FY24 growth,” the brokerage added.

“In our view, the sector’s outlook remains “fluid”, specifically with increased macro “noise” during the past two weeks as well as SVB’s failure, likely causing enterprise clients to procrastinate on IT spending decisions, further delaying CY23’s actual budget cycle, and resulting in longer sale cycles, while also impacting sector’s near-term visibility,” Research and Advisory firm Wedbush said in an industry note.

The advisory has made revenue growth adjustments for Accenture, Infosys, and Cognizant and believes the EPS impact will be marginal, given the supply-side tailwinds such as moderating wage inflation, subcontractor use decline and widening pyramid structure.

There would be no change in strategy as of now, Krithivasan, who takes charge in the financial year 2023-24, said. TCS has a core set of beliefs that it would continue with, while strategy and priorities would be recalibrated in keeping with market conditions, he said.

‘It's a continuum'

“We (Rajesh Gopinathan and Krithivasan) have enjoyed every moment in this organization. It's a continuum. It's not that as every CEO changes, we come up with a new strategy or new set of priorities. We have a core set of beliefs and values. We're focusing on employees, focusing on our customers is the most important engine that drives our growth. We always try to be close to our customers,” he said.

Like his predecessor Gopinathan, Krithivasan is also a TCS lifer who has been with the company for 34 years.

Gopinathan, who will stay on till September 15, said he wanted to ensure that the transition was smooth and would be available to Krithivasan 100 percent.

Before his elevation, Krithivasan was the global head of the company’s BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) business group, the largest vertical for the company which accounts for 35-40 percent of the revenue.

He has held various roles, including delivery, customer relationship management, large program management, and sales.

Krithivasan, who will move to Mumbai from Chennai, said in a lighter vein that it was the move that was harder than taking on the role.

He takes on the mantle at 58, which is relatively late compared to his peers in other top Indian IT companies.

Gopinathan said that the retirement age for executive directors at TCS was 65, which gives Krithivasan at least six years, and appointments for five-year terms.

Commenting on how the Board chose Krithivasan, Gopinathan said, “If you look at the history when I took over, your questions were is this guy too young? Now Krithi is taking over, your question is this guy too old? Those kinds of questions will keep on coming.

“The board and NRC looked at a complete variety of candidates and current situations and what is required and what they felt is the best fit. And the unanimous choice was that Krithi is the best fit and the best person for the job at this point in time.”

Challenging times

He also takes on the role at a time when the IT sector is facing significant headwinds amid a challenging demand environment and macroeconomic climate.

“As the market situation changes, we’ll recalibrate what we want to do, where we want to focus on and I'm sure along with Rajesh in the next six months, we will rework on what we have to do,” Krithivasan said.

He said they believed that every change in the market was a new opportunity.

“Just because we have a macroeconomic situation doesn't mean the customers are done with all the digital transformation and they have to stop doing any transformation. If at all, there is actually more need to continue and maybe for a quarter or two, this disturbance will remain.

“But growth has to come back, our customers have to transform and leverage all the digital technologies available. We will continue to focus on transforming our customers, bringing technology to the center of their business. In the short answer, we will not make any change we will continue to focus on core principles and fine-tune as we go along,” Krithivasan said.

He added that the company didn’t see any insurmountable challenges ahead of it.

For now, Krithivasan said their role was to remove hurdles faced by associates, so that they could perform well.

“We will look at what is the best way to reorganize yourself as required. We don't expect any dramatic change in terms of how we are going to reorganize. In terms of priorities and strategy, what we'll focus on is core principles.

“Strategy and priority, we'll tweak as we go along every year, the core principle is work closely with customers, look at what their needs are as proactively as possible. Go to them with the solutions and work with our associates who have been the bedrock of our success...

After the unexpected resignation of TCS CEO & MD Rajesh Gopinathan on March 16, the focus is now on CEO designate K Krithivasan who is set to take over the role from September 2023.

Analysts have expressed confidence in Krithivasan, who is currently global head of BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) business, on the back of his long tenure with the company as well as his vast experience in the Industry.

Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities says that while exits are possible, it must be pointed out that Krithivasan was a clear front-runner in case Rajesh ever wished to step down.

“The question that we have been asked is why appoint Krithivasan when age is not on his side; after all, Krithivasan is 57 years old,” it highlighted.

Krithivasan’s experience in handling a vast portfolio and over 34 years of experience with TCS makes the brokerage optimistic on the road ahead.

“Krithivasan is first among equals in many ways in the organization.

On TCS’s leadership history, the brokerage mentioned that Gopinathan took over as CEO from Chandra in Feb 2017 after the latter was appointed as the Chairman of Tata Sons. Under Chandra, TCS was in a position of strength with leadership in various domains, early investments in digital and products and platforms and strength in large deals. Rajesh built on a strong platform set by predecessors and further enhanced TCS’ positioning, it added.

During a Media Brief on Friday, CEO Designate K Krithivasan said that TCS has been built on 2 Pillars i.e customer centricity and employees and that priorities and strategies will not change with change in leadership adding that he wants to double down on making customer relationships stronger.

At 10.03 a.m, the share price of TCS was trading 0.60 percent down at Rs 3,165.80 while benchmark Nifty IT was trading 0.98 percent up at 28,797.15 points.",411,0.9267622828483582

On the evening of March 16, TCS announced that Rajesh Gopinathan has resigned. K Krithivasan is the CEO designate as of March 16, and Gopinathan will stay on till September to help with the transition.

Post the transition, Gopinathan said he is looking forward to enjoying some downtime, spending time with family, and sitting back and thinking about what he wants to do next. Gopinathan had joined the group in 1996.

“It would not have been apt to do that when I am doing something as important as this,” he said. He added that the Tata group is where he has seen and learnt everything he knows, and that he enjoyed the mentorship of Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekharan.

A usually reticent Gopinathan opened up during the press conference post the announcement of his exit. He said that the last time he wrote his resume was when he was doing his MBA, and quipped that fielding questions from the press quarter after quarter for the last decade has been among the hardest things he has done.

“I can’t tell you how happy and light I feel. Till a week back it was all-consuming. The last 48 hours it has been very liberating. I have no clue what I’m going to do (going ahead),” he said.

Asked if he was going to take on an advisory role after he leaves the company, Gopinathan said, “Long before I owned a car, when walking on the road my attitude towards car owners was 'car khareeda, road thodi na khareedi hai,’ (you’ve bought a car, not the road), and I used to walk however I wanted. When you start driving a car, you have a different perspective of pedestrians. Similarly, when it comes to advisors, when I was in an operational role, I used to hate advisors of all forms completely. It’ll be interesting now, since I might be the one great advisor the world is waiting for,” he said.

Timing of exit

Asked about the timing behind the move, Gopinathan told the press that there was ""no better time than now to quit,"" and added: ""It was important to do this before the start of the financial year so that the new CEO has the full runway.""

He added that volatility has been managed and the company has grown at a steady clip of 14.8 percent and crossed big milestones.

However, he explained that volatility is par for the course and there will be ups and downs. “We have come together in times of crisis and stood together as a team, and will do so again,’’ he added.

Gopinathan said that he has been discussing his departure with Chandra on and off. “One day you get up and say you thought it through, and that happened just a week or so back,” he said.

“I had never allowed myself to think about something else while I’m sitting here. I don’t think that would be appropriate. I spent every waking minute thinking about TCS and that’s the way it has been. But when you start wondering if you should continue, it’s best to say that it is time and hand it over,” he added.

On TCS’ growth in FY24, Gopinathan said he has absolutely no clue and it is not his business to comment on it.

Gopinathan said that he wants to make sure that the transition happens smoothly, and that he has no plans to skimp on that, adding that he will be available to Krithivasan 100 percent.

Krithivasan is currently the global head of the company’s BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) business group, the company’s largest vertical accounting for 35-40 percent of its revenue.

Speaking to the press, Krithivasan said there will be no change in strategy at the moment, and that TCS, as a company, has a core set of beliefs that will continue. “Focussing on our employees, focussing on our customers is the most important engine that drives our growth,’’ he added.",692,0.32720832029978436

Rajesh Gopinathan's resignation as the managing director and CEO of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) marked the end of a six-year stint which saw the company grow from strength-to-strength. Gopinathan's role in the growth of TCS during his time at the helm made him an inspiration for many.

A TCS employee had shared a LinkedIn post three years ago about how Gopinathan had inspired his six-year-old daughter and purchased a telescope for herself.

Cheekily, though, the employee admitted that he was fortunate Gopinathan did not own a Rolls Royce or a private jet.

""My 6 years old daughter got inspirational from Mr. Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO of #tataconsultancyservices #tcs and got a telescope for herself

What an amazing inspiration. But I am lucky that Rajesh didn’t have Rolls Royce or a private jet in the background,"" the post said.

Gopinathan had replied to the post saying he wished the girl followed her dreams and climbed greater heights in her life.

""Here's wishing the little girl follows her dreams, reaches for the stars, and achieves much beyond and more than rolls royce and private jets,"" he said.

TCS, India’s largest software services firm took the street by surprise after the company announced a sudden change in its leadership on Thursday.

Rajesh Gopinathan, who has been the CEO and MD of the company for 6ix years, announced stepping down from the role to pursue other interests. Overall, he spent 22 years in the company and added over $10 billion in incremental revenues and over $70 billion increase in market capitalisation.

Under his leadership, the company’s revenue increased 63 percent from Rs 1.18 lakh crore in FY17 to Rs 1.92 lakh crore in FY22. EBITDA also increased 64 percent over Gopinathan’s tenure to Rs 53,100 crore in FY22 while net profit grew 46 percent from FY17-FY22 to Rs 38,300 crore. The company’s margins have remained steady over the last six years with EBITDA Margin at around 27-28 percent levels and Net profit margin at 20-22 percent.

The company has appointed the current global head of the BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) business, K Krithivasan as CEO-designate who will take over the role from September 2023.

Though the announcement comes unexpectedly, analysts don’t see any upcoming hiccups in the transition.

According to Bernstein Research, the leadership change was unexpected during a challenging macro environment and the change could bring volatility amongst weak macro and rebuilding competition. However, the brokerage notes that TCS enjoys a premium valuation of 26x 1-yr Forward EPS amongst peers and expects the company to continue its strategy on large cost take-out deals under the new CEO. The research firm has an overweight Rating on TCS at a target price of Rs 3,840.

Brokerage Firm CLSA has an 'outperform' rating with a target price of Rs 3,550 and believes that the transition will be smooth and the company’s stable business leadership team should help. It expects minimum business impact due to the change. Succession planning could become a point of focus, especially for long-term investors, it added.

The stock is unlikely to underperform in coming months, said analysts at Morgan Stanley who have an equal-weight rating for the stock at a target price of Rs 3,350.

The planned resignation of the CEO has come as a surprise and may create a short-term overhang, the brokerage added and also expect the transition to be smooth and well managed as seen in past.

According to Kotak Securities Rajesh built on a strong platform set by predecessors and further enhanced TCS’ positioning.

TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan has resigned from his position and will be leaving the company in September. Here is a look back on an interview he did with Moneycontrol, in which he had important job-hunting tips for fresh graduates.

Moneycontrol had asked Gopinathan what advice he would give to a 19-year-old or a 20-year-old who'd graduate in 2o23 in an uncertain job market.

""Nineteen-year-olds typically know better, so they will do whatever they have to do. But it is important to choose some area and stay with it for a period of time, and not declare yourself an expert too fast and move on. So rather than flit from one to the other,"" he said.

""Because it's only with time that you understand the nuances better. The first flush is the context, because the first flush is easy to learn, but that's, that's, you know, 10 per cent of the game.""

Responding to another question on how TCS has managed to retain more than 1 lakh employees for 10 years, Rajesh Gopinathan said that they back promising employees, and always look inside every time a new opportunity pops up instead of looking for fresh talent outside the organisation.

""So one of the reasons we're able to do that is, whenever something new comes, the first right of leadership in anything new goes to somebody inside,"" he said.

""So if you want to get into ChatGPT, we're not going to go and into the market saying that among the various people who are, who can we hire? Who knows something incremental on it. We look internally and say, who's likely to be the most knowledgeable or who can learn fast, back them up, give them the resources, learn and ask them now tell us what can we do with it, and then try to move the organisation that way.

Gopinath added that when employees see that they are being presented with better opportunities inside the organisation, there are more chances of them continuing to work for the company.

""As long as you keep on giving that opportunity of new things to internal people, you will retain talent. And the more you retain talent, the more you keep the context inside. And that gives you the competitive space, which gives you the space to get more growth opportunities.""

Gopinathan, who was first appointed MD & CEO of TCS in 2017, had been re-appointed for a second term in 2022 for a period of five years. Before this role, he had served as CFO (Chief Financial Officer) of the company from 2013 to 2017.

“I have thoroughly enjoyed my exciting 22-year tenure at TCS. It has been a pleasure working closely with Chandra, who has mentored me through this entire period. The last six years of leading this iconic organisation have been most enriching and fulfilling, adding over $10 billion in incremental revenues and over $70 billion increase in market capitalization,” Gopinathan said in a press statement.

Many accomplishments

Since Gopinathan’s appointment as CEO, the share price of India’s largest software services firm has increased from Rs 1,258 in February 2017 to Rs 3,182 (+153 percent) as of Thursday’s closing. Under his leadership, the company became the second most valuable company in India and crossed $168 billion in market cap in FY23. The company was also recognised as the most valuable Indian brand in 2022 by Kantar BrandZ India rankings.

Smooth transition and continuity expected

While the announcement was sudden, some experts believe that barring the temporary short-term negative market reaction, the path ahead and transition is expected to be smooth, ensuring continuity. That confidence is backed by Krithvasan’s experience in the industry, as well as his history with the company — he has been part of the firm since 1989.

""Rajesh Gopinathan was the key person in making TCS a super execution company with top-notch corporate governance. However, I believe there will be no fundamental change as K Krithivasan has been with the company since 1989 and was the BFSI head, so he has a prominent hold on the business verticals. However, the stock’s sentiment may get impacted negatively for the next few days,” Omkar Tanksale of Axis Securities told CNBC-TV18.

As someone who’s closely worked with Infosys CEO Salil Parekh and has expertise in the BFSI and healthcare space, Joshi is expected to re-energise the business, industry experts said.

According to analysts, Joshi’s experience of over 22 years with the IT services behemoth and his involvement in executing Infosys’ transformation as part of its leadership team over the past few years, will help him think strategically on winning large deals for Tech Mahindra, deals that usually go to the top two or three companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys.

Joshi resigned from Infosys on March 11, and will be taking over the reins of Tech Mahindra from current CEO and MD CP Gurnani on December 20.

The Mahindra group leadership was keen to bring in some fresh thinking from outside, said Phil Fersht, Founder and Chief Analyst of HFS Research.

“Mohit Joshi has been coveted as a potential CEO in the services industry, and Tech Mahindra is a superb opportunity, especially as Salil Parekh has over four years remaining on his Infosys contract,” he told Moneycontrol.

Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst, Constellation Research concurred, ""Joshi is one of the large deal architects at Infosys. Like Ravi Kumar S, these are the folks that have help make Infosys successful.""

""While Salil Parekh has a deep bench, these two were always considered next in line for CEO so when Salil’s contract was renewed, competitors have been looking for good leaders that understood big deals,"" Wang told Moneycontrol.

Fersht added that Joshi has a proven track record of growing business units and is well respected both within Infosys and by its banking and financial services customers as a strategic thinker and strong delivery leader.

“He brings vital industry experience to Tech M outside of its traditional telecoms mainstay, and will bring fresh energy and ideas to the firm,” Fersht said.

According to Pareekh Jain, Founder and CEO, EIIRTrend, Joshi will be bringing his experience as part of Infosys’ transformation leadership team, both under former CEO Vishal Sikka and now Parekh. ``They transformed Infosys in the last four-five years,’’ he said.

As President at Infosys, Joshi is responsible for the Financial Services, Insurance, Healthcare, and Life Sciences businesses. Additionally, he is the Chairman of Edgeverve Systems, wherein he leads the company’s software business which includes Finacle, Infosys’ global banking platform. He also led sales operations and effectiveness for Infosys and has executive responsibility for large deals across the firm.

Tech Mahindra needs a strategy refresh

Analysts are batting for Joshi as they think Tech Mahindra needs a strategy refresh and needs to expand beyond its stronghold of telecom and CME (Communications, Media and Entertainment) verticals. Joshi fits in beautifully as he comes from the BFSI and healthcare domains.

“Tech Mahindra needs a strategy refresh. They have the lowest margins among Tier-I IT companies. Their growth is not in the top quartile and they are not winning large deals. From that perspective, bringing someone who has performed in a Tier-I firm is a good choice,’’ Jain said.

He added, “Apart from that, he was heading BFSI, healthcare, and the Europe market --- all segments Tech Mahindra is not strong in compared to other Tier-I firms. He was also a part of the overall sales transformation at Infosys. That experience will be very helpful while going for a strategy refresh; especially given that Nasscom has said that overall growth this year will be similar to last year or lower.”

Tech Mahindra will need to capture large cost takeout deals in the current environment to grow, Jain added.

Tech Mahindra has a lot of opportunities to build up its analytics, automation, and AI practices -- areas at the core of where digital is headed, said Wang.

""The shift to more focused industry plays need to match the ability to build offerings that are more high margin. This isn’t an easy play to make, but you can do it with a large deal mentality,"" he added.

During the company’s Investor Day on March 3, Gurnani said that while Tech Mahindra is predominantly known for its telecom vertical, the company is also trying to diversify and change the portfolio mix of segments, given the changing regulatory environment and other challenges in different geographies globally in the telecom space.

Currently, around 41 percent of Tech Mahindra’s revenues are from telecom, and 60 percent is from its enterprise business.

The company is also betting big on its product and platform business, which Gurnani estimated will become a $1 billion revenue vertical in the next three years.

According to Forrester Research India’s Head of Research, Ashutosh Sharma, Joshi will need to re-energise Tech Mahindra, which has a lot of latent potential and capabilities in the manufacturing domain courtesy its parent, the Mahindra group, especially in the automotive space.

“Tech Mahindra has not capitalised on that as much as TCS has. Joshi will have a lot of work to do,” he told Moneycontrol.

Sharma added that Tech Mahindra has been strong in Telecom and manufacturing, but there are areas where it’s not among the leaders.

“They have grown, but not at the fastest pace. Joshi will have to focus a lot on navigating through the current environment, which presages tough times ahead for the industry. Though IT services companies benefit from downturns as well,” he added, referring to the current global uncertainties caused by inflation, impending recession in the US, the Russia-Ukraine war, etc.",930,0.5888720949490865

Generative AI tech like ChatGPT, Bard and others have taken over the world since the beginning of 2023. Now the narrative is shifting towards what more can the generative AI tech do to deliver on strong business use cases.

Krishnan Ramanujam, President, Enterprise Growth Group, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Chairman, Nasscom, spoke to Moneycontrol on the sidelines of the Nasscom Technology and Leadership Forum 2023, sharing his outlook on the tech trends that will unlock growth for the IT sector in FY24, nature of deal wins, hiring slowdown, hype around ChatGPT and cloud migration and more. Edited excerpts:

Nasscom’s strategic review numbers are out. And we have added 2.90 lakh jobs in FY23. Do you expect to add on a similar number in the upcoming year in FY24? Or a slowdown, what's your outlook?

As I said, yeah, we added 290,000 jobs in this industry during the current year. But giving a sense of what will likely be next year will be very hard. Firstly, Nasscom as an industry body is not ideally placed for any forecasts. So it's not our job to forecast. But broadly, I will give some trend lines. And from that point of view, I think the next year is likely to be very similar. Clearly, even in FY23, we saw three Covid level growth compared to pre-Covid levels grew stronger, next year is likely to be similar.

We have also started seeing a slowdown in terms of quarter-on-quarter hiring in some of the IT companies. Plus there seems to be a delay in onboarding. So how are you assessing it? And is that in any way a sign that the demand may also have started to slow down for the IT sector?

The last two years have been very atypical. Firstly, because of Covid. In FY21, the numbers went way down for the industry. And in FY22 we saw a very handsome pullback. So these are two very atypical years. And they cannot form the baseline for what is to follow.

So in many ways, FY23 is the first year in which we saw very minimal effects of Covid, and that has to be compared to the pre-Covid level numbers. In FY22, we saw a lot of euphoria and adoption of technology. Meanwhile, the companies prepared for a future where the demand is expected to be very high. Then, when the correction inevitably happens, companies have to do what it's necessary to correct it. Whatever over-investment happened during the previous year, has to be corrected. And that is what is going on. I don't look at it as de-growth or negative sentiment for the industry; it is just the market dynamics playing out and adjusting to calibrate to the demand. Within a few quarters, I believe it will return to normal.

So do you expect a delay in onboarding in FY24?

I think many of our member companies have announced onboarding delays. So, yes.

Since 2023 started, generative AI and ChatGPT seem to be the flavour of the season. As TCS, what is your outlook? How do you expect ChatGPT and similar generative AI technologies impacting the IT services industry? Will this impact the way coding is done and other business aspects?

So, generative AI is definitely a very exciting new piece of technology. It has the potential to completely reset the economics of coding by significantly improving productivity and efficiency. However, the true benefits, both in terms of productivity and transformation, will be realised when ChatGPT, Bard, or any of the generative AI technologies can deliver enterprise use cases. Whether typically there is a business case, there’s an unsolved problem that is solved more efficiently, or something that takes a lot of time, is done much more quickly. When these kinds of use cases begin to be delivered by generative AI technologies, the true transformative power of that technology will be unleashed. Until then, it will be a cool technology with a lot of potential and a lot of us are working to get those enterprise use cases delivered using this.

Are you seeing any use cases and discussions happening at TCS? Are the clients coming up with it and talking about it?

As the chairman of Nasscom, I will not comment on TCS. But, yes, many Nasscom member companies are hard at work, looking for use cases where the generative AI technology can be beneficial.

From an industry perspective, what are the trends you're seeing in terms of the nature of deal wins that you are observing with Nasscom’s members? And in terms of the size of deals are they going to be large this year or is the size going to go down?

I'll highlight a few points. The cloud is massive, and growth in the cloud is still accelerating. And, as businesses become more comfortable with cloud migration, the deal sizes grow larger and larger.

Cloud — it's one thing to migrate on-premise estates to the cloud, but the more transformative benefits come when you can reimagine your business, and delivering those transformational benefits with cloud as the underlying piece of technology where there's a lot more consulting-led transformations, rearchitecting solutions, and reimagining customer experience and things of that nature, those are also driving significant amounts of growth.

In order to do those, there is a lot of application modernization, even rewriting, and refactoring work. And similarly, managing all of this infrastructure mode. Part of your estate is on the cloud, part is on-premise, and a part of it is third party. This kind of hybrid mixed estate management is a fairly complex affair. And that is also a good growth area. So to sum it all up, I would say cloud and associated cybersecurity, hybrid management, application modernization will probably be the top four things that I would call out as the big areas that are driving growth.

Are new cloud migration deals still going big for IT firms, because we have seen that hyperscalers have reported decline in revenues. Obviously, deals in phase 2 of digital transformation deals are still on?

The cloud migrations are continuing apace, I wouldn’t say that the cloud migrations have slowed down. The fact that the hyperscalers have declared results that indicate a slowdown in their signings -- that means the clients are now demanding a business case, and probably the real business case on which the first wave of cloud transformations occurred are probably getting delayed. Customers want to consolidate whatever they've done and ensure that the business benefits from previous cloud investments. The first phase of the cloud migrations are achieved before they want to commit anything further to the second, which means some sense of realism will start getting them.

In many ways, cloud was also a big hype. And now the realism is setting in. True migrations to the cloud to deliver business focus benefits, will now start coming to the fore, which by definition means things will be more realistic, which means a little slower than the stupendous hikes that we saw in the last couple of years.",1203,-0.17175081868966421

Narayana Murthy recently made a comment on the fears of artificial intelligence (AI) replacing human beings at workplaces. He said that AI will give humans the space and time to think more creatively and productively, as an ""assistive"" tool.

The Infosys co-founder added that AI has made life more comfortable and human beings will never let technology replace them, Hindustan Times reported. He said that humans “have the power of the mind” which no machine can compete with and that the human mind is one step ahead of technology and is capable of becoming its ""master"".

Concerns related to AI sparked this year after the introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT which was followed by other AI chatbots such as Microsoft's Bing and Google's Bard. There were also reports of companies replacing employees with AI chatbots.

Narayana Murthy also reminded people of initial apprehensions when computers and smartphones were invented. “Many thought at one point of time that all these computers will make us more free. It has not happened,” he said stressing how human beings will feel that there is not enough time and will never be satisfied even after being assisted by AI.

Reacting to the same topic, a top TCS official had stated that generative artificial intelligence platforms like ChatGPT will create an ""AI co-worker"" and not replace jobs.

The market faced severe selling pressure in the week ended February 24 and closed at a four-month low following a hawkish commentary by Fed officials and increase in US bond yields and the dollar index.

The Nifty50 shed 2.67 percent during the week, the biggest weekly loss since June 2022, to close at 17,466 and formed a large, bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, with decisively breaking 200-day EMA (exponential moving average 17,590). It also settled below long upward sloping support trendline adjoining the lows of March 2020 and of June 2022.

Hence, the next support is placed at 200-day SMA (simple moving average - 17,368) which coincides with Budget day's low as breaking of the same can drag the Nifty towards 17,000 level, whereas the near-term resistance is expected at 17,600 followed by 17,700-17,800 area, experts said.

""There is a possibility that the index may head towards 17,200-17,100 levels in the coming sessions as 17,700-17,750 will act as a strong resistance,"" Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio, said.

In the worst-case scenarios, Sameet Chavan of Angel One feels the Nifty may find support around its intermediate levels of 17,000–16,700.

""Taking the current situation into consideration, the Nifty is placed around its sacrosanct support zone 17,350 which coincides with the 200-day SMA. Hence, till the time we do not break below this level, we remain hopeful of some recovery in coming week,"" he said.

Options data suggests a broader trading range in between 17,200 to 17,700 zones due to higher volatility while immediate trading ranges in between 17,200 to 17,600 zones.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the February 24 closing prices:

Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

GAIL: Buy | LTP: Rs 103 | Stop-Loss: Rs 96 | Target: Rs 115 | Return: 11 percent

GAIL has shown relative strength last week. While the Nifty has lost 2.67 percent last week, GAIL has gained a healthy 7.92 percent. In the process, the stock has closed above its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes, which augurs well for the uptrend to continue.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI (relative strength index), too, are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.

With the intermediate technical setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 101-105 levels, with stop-loss at Rs 96 while target at Rs 115.

Hindalco Industries: Sell | LTP: Rs 415 | Stop-Loss: Rs 438 | Target: Rs 375 | Return: 10 percent

Hindalco is in a short term downtrend as it has been making lower tops and lower bottoms for the last several weeks. Last week, the stock broke down from its recent trading range, indicating that the downtrend looks set to continue.

Technical indicators are giving negative signals as the stock is now trading below the 20-day and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in decline mode and not oversold, which implies potential for more downsides.

We therefore expect the stock to correct further in the coming sessions. Sell between Rs 414-418 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 438 while downside target at Rs 375.

Vedanta: Sell | LTP: Rs 294 | Stop-Loss: Rs 305 | Target: Rs 280 | Return: 5 percent

Vedanta is in a short term downtrend as it has been consistently making lower tops and lower bottoms for the last several weeks after breaking the support of Rs 313. Recently, the stock reacted from the 20-day SMA and continued to trend lower.

With the stock trading below key moving averages like the 20 and 50-day SMA, the 14-week RSI in decline mode and the intermediate technical setup looking negative, we believe the stock is headed lower in the coming weeks.

We therefore recommend a sell between Rs 293-297 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 305 and downside target at Rs 280.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equities Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

TCS: Sell | LTP: Rs 3,400 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,580 | Target: Rs 3,250 | Return: 4.4 percent

The stock is making a series of lower tops and lower bottoms. It was at Rs 3,575 on February 16 and is currently trading at Rs 3,400, which is below the 20-day SMA level.

According to the major oscillator, it is turning negative, which is an indication of further weakness.

From a trading perspective, it is advisable to sell at the current level and on a rally of Rs 3,450. Place the final stop-loss at Rs 3,580. On the downside, it will find major support at Rs 3,350 and Rs 3,250.

SAIL: Sell | LTP: Rs 83 | Stop-Loss: Rs 86 | Target: Rs 75 | Return: 10 percent

It has formed a bearish continuation pattern on the daily chart. A lower top and breaking of a flag formation is indicating further weakness in the near term.

Depending on the formation, the stock may slide further toward Rs 79 or Rs 75 in the coming weeks. The strategy should be to sell the stock at the current level and at Rs 85. However, for that, it is mandatory to keep the stop-loss at Rs 86.

GNFC: Buy | LTP: Rs 552 | Stop-Loss: Rs 520 | Target: Rs 600 | Return: 9 percent

The stock is forming a typical bullish consolidation structure since the beginning of the month of December. It is diverging positively and it is on the verge of absorbing the selling pressure, which is at Rs 565.

From a trading point of view, we should be buyers but in tranches. Buy 50 percent at current levels and the rest at Rs 535. On higher levels, it has scope for a rise towards Rs 565 and Rs 600. For the same, place a stop-loss at Rs 520.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Petronet LNG: Buy | LTP: Rs 222 | Stop-Loss: Rs 211 | Target: Rs 239 | Return: 8 percent

The stock had recently witnessed a breakout above its falling trendline resistance on the weekly charts. After an upmove upto Rs 230, prices retraced back towards the support and it now witnessing a positive momentum indicating possibility of a resumption of the uptrend.

The momentum readings on the weekly charts are in positive zone. Hence, short term traders can look for buying opportunities around current market price of Rs 221 for near term targets of Rs 230 and Rs 239. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 211.

Expert: Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio

Zomato: Buy | LTP: Rs 54.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 51.50 | Target: Rs 65 | Return: 19 percent

On a weekly basis, the price has witnessed long bearish trend from its all-time highs which is placed at Rs 169. Recently the price has taken support of its prior demand zone with bullish reversal candlesticks ""Morning Star"". The price has shifted just above the 9-day EMA with spurt volume which indicates immediate support to the price.

At the same time, the indicator MACD (moving average convergence divergence) suggested a positive crossover confirming long position. However, the price has faced immediate resistance of 20-day EMA which is placed at Rs 57.10.

Hence, based on the above-mentioned technical structure, one can initiate a long position in Zomato at CMP Rs 54.80 or a fall in the price till Rs 54 levels can be used as a buying opportunity for the upside target of Rs 60 & Rs 65. However, the bullish view will be negated if Zomato closes below the support level of Rs 51.50.

Siemens: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,246 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,050 | Target: Rs 3,610 | Return: 11 percent

On a weekly timeframe, the price has been rising continuously with higher highs and higher lows formation. In addition, the price has also been trading above 9 and 20-day exponential moving averages from the last few weeks indicating a strong bullish trend. Recently the price has given a breakout of the Ascending Triangle Pattern confirming the continuation of the bullish trend.

At the same time, the MACD indicator suggested also a positive crossover with rising histograms and the daily Relative Strength Indicator traded above 60 level which indicates bullish strength.

Hence, based on the above-mentioned technical structure, one can initiate a long position in Siemens at CMP Rs 3,245, or a fall in the price till Rs 3,207 levels can be used as a buying opportunity for the upside target of Rs 3,610. However, the bullish view will be negated if Siemens closes below the support level of Rs 3,050.

Kirloskar Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,204 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,110 | Target: Rs 2,430 | Return: 10 percent

The MACD histogram is hovering in positive territory with inclining trajectory confirming bullish trend may continue. A momentum indicator RSI (14) is reading above 50 levels, which suggests a bullish move for the near term.

Hence, based on the above-mentioned technical structure, one can initiate a long position in Kirloskar Industries at CMP Rs 2,204, or a fall in the price till Rs 2,195 levels can be used as a buying opportunity for the upside target of Rs 2,430.

""It is not that jobs will get replaced, but the job definitions will change,"" he added in the comments which will assuage concerns about future of jobs in the sector which is one of the biggest recruiters of engineering talent in the country.

The introduction of platforms like ChatGPT has led to concerns on whether a trained human is needed at all to deliver the work which a technology company offers to clients. Already, there are examples of entire codes being generated through such platforms. One of the reasons for massive layoffs by big tech companies across the world is being attributed to the emergence of such intuitive platforms.

Lakkad said the context in which a particular customer works is extremely important, and the need to differentiate its offerings from competition makes it essential for a customer to keep on evolving continuously. The amount of work to be done by a human being versus the generative AI platforms will vary as per industry as well, he said. If anything, it will reduce the need for managerial talent but the demand for workers lower down the hierarchy will continue as they will get crucial skills on the context front, he said. ""It’s (generative AI) a good thing to happen for the future, but I think it will be collaboration rather than replacement,"" Lakkad said, adding that the emergence of such tools will not change the business models. Such tools will help improve the productivity, consistency of the work which gets delivered and reduce the need for governance, up the pace of delivery and reduce the need for peripheral functions, he said. TCS is using such inputs in ""some pockets"" already, Lakkad said, adding that a lot of the work will happen in these areas going forward and the entire picture will get clear only in two years’ time. There will be changes in training which will take place as a result, Lakkad said, adding that the company pays a lot of attention to this aspect and typically plans in advance for requirements of the future.",489,-0.9363106489181519

Amid massive layoffs by some of the biggest global and domestic companies, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has announced it would give its employees a raise this year. The hike will be similar to what they have received in previous years, chief Human Resources officer Milind Lakkad said.

Speaking to news agency PTI, he said TCS, which employs over 6 lakh people, is not considering any layoffs as it believes in grooming talent for longer careers once it hires an employee.

""We don't do that (layoffs), we believe in grooming talent in the company (there will be) no layoffs,"" Lakkad said, replying to a specific question on whether there will be layoffs or involuntary attrition.

He said many companies are forced to take such a step because they hired more than they wanted while the 'cautious' TCS believes that once a staff member joins, it is the company's responsibility to make them productive and derive value.

In cases where it finds a gap between the skill sets required and what certain employees possess, it focuses on training the employees by giving them more time, Lakkad added.

The top TCS official also said that the company is looking to hire workers laid off by other companies.

""It is a very large canvas, we are doing exciting work across different industries in different technologies. I think all of that requires some phenomenal talent to come in and participate. we are getting it obviously from startups, people who have actually done some good work in those companies and have short-term career challenges,"" he said.

When asked if TCS will be reviewing its stock options schemes, given that startups attract a lot of talent based on such offers, Lakkad said it is continuing to evaluate on this aspect as it feels that both loyalty and performance play a significant role.

To a question on whether the decline of over 2,000 staffers in overall employee count in the December quarter was a one-off, Lakkad declined to specify if the March quarter will have an addition or continue with a decline.

He explained that over the last year, it has hired over 2 lakh people including 1.19 lakh trainees, who are still getting into billable projects and hence, the slowdown in new hires resulted in the decline.

Over the next few quarters, the company does not see significant additions from a net employees standpoint, Lakkad said, pointing out that it is leveraging its past investments now.

This will lead to an increase in the overall utilisation number, before it starts going down as the over 40,000 trainees it expects to hire in FY24 start coming in, Lakkad said.

The company is also open to hiring people of Indian diaspora in the US who have lost their jobs with the tech majors and May be on the brink of being forced to return home as per their visa conditions, Lakkad said.

At present, 70 per cent of its US employees are Americans, Lakkad said, adding that it would like to get the number down to 50 per cent because it also wants to offer global opportunities to its staff in India.

He also said that there is a need for quicker appointments and clearance for both business and H1 visas in the US, its largest market by revenue.

Earlier this week, Moneycontrol had reported that the big three cloud-service providers -- Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platforms (GCP) – together reported a single-digit YoY growth in deal wins by annual contract value (ACV) in Q4CY2022.

This has been a fall from a 57 percent YoY growth in ACV in Q1. Revenue growth, too, has been steadily declining consequently.

This, however, won’t have much of an impact on IT services companies, despite them working closely with these cloud-service providers, industry experts told Moneycontrol.

The current slowdown, following the past couple of years of aggressive pandemic-driven cloud and digital transformation spending, will get compensated with the phase two transformation projects involving implementation and cost optimisation, they said, amidst clients rethinking technology budgets due to inflation and increasing macro-economic challenges globally.

According to Sanjay Jalona, an industry veteran and former CEO and Managing Director of L&T Infotech (LTI), there is a lot of work to be done, now that client companies have made quite some investments in hyperscalers.

Jalona, currently the operating partner at ChrysCapital, said: “I believe there is a lot of work to be done for all the investments clients have already made with hyperscalers. Though the growth rate would probably be a bit soft, I think the growth rate on cloud would continue for IT companies.”

Pareekh Jain, founder and CEO, EIIRTrend, said that, in the last fiscal year, every digital deal involved cloud migration as a part of it. And currently, almost 40-50 percent of the active deals for IT service providers are digital.

Lots of existing cloud-migration clients still there

So, even if new cloud migration deals are not happening, there are still plenty of customers who have already migrated to cloud and want to move to the next level.

“Adding new customers for migration will be on a pause. But existing customers who have already migrated to cloud will continue to extend deals with service providers to implement and optimise for them,” Jain said.

There will still be some impact on budgets for IT services but the impact would be lesser, he said.

“We are seeing a decline in growth rate, YoY, but hyperscalers are still growing. This will impact our IT service providers too. Clients were spending a lot on cloud earlier and then service deals were coming to service providers. As clients relook at cloud spend, they will relook at the services spend also, but to a lesser extent,” he told Moneycontrol.

Speaking about the nature of deals being observed, Mrinal Rai, Principal analyst at ISG, said IT companies are helping clients design their strategies and consulting on how to move those workloads.

“This is the time when those enterprise clients are actually implementing these strategies. So there is enough work around cost optimization, retransformation and refactoring, which will require a lot of expertise,” he said.

Many of these would fall under the core managed services practice of outsourcing the responsibility for maintaining, and anticipating the need for a range of processes and functions, among other facilities, provided by IT services companies.

All of this does echo the words of the IT industry too. Last month, in an interview with Moneycontrol, Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and MD of TCS, highlighted that there has been mindless spending on cloud lately, and that this will lead to specific project-led cloud spending by companies to bring down cloud costs. IT companies, especially TCS, will benefit from this trend too, he said.

""Once you have done the architecture, it actually unleashes a second round of transformation, which is the right reason to go to cloud. You can open up your architecture for much more composable functionality so that as your business model shifts, you will be able to move faster with it, or your upgrade cycles will be faster,” Gopinathan had said.

During its earnings meeting last month, Infosys’ CEO and MD Salil Parekh, too, said that the company’s large deal pipeline is seeing increased traction for automation and cost-efficiency programmes.

According to Forrester Research India’s Head of Research Ashutosh Sharma, IT services firms have a very good portfolio of projects across dimensions and they specialise in cost reduction.

“Any company trying to cut down their on-site costs, cost of IT in other geographies, and offshoring will come to IT companies. They compute and analyse data as well. IT companies have always benefited from these downtrends,” he said.

“But this will depend on the extent of downtrend that will occur and how much the clients will cut down from discretionary spending,” he added.

Queries sent to Infosys and HCLTech did not elicit any response. TCS, Wipro, TechMahindra, Cognizant and LTIMindtree declined to comment.

Not all gloom

It’s not all gloom ultimately for cloud-service providers either, said Amit Chandra, Deputy Vice President, HDFC Securities. Despite the slowdown in YoY growth percentage, the base of comparison has increased as the combined size of the three hyperscalers have grown $100 billion to $200 billion, according to Chandra.

Several companies, including IT companies like HCLTech, TCS and LTIMindtree, remain bullish on the opportunities expected from cloud in 2024. Chandra added that managed services growth rates too have not come down significantly.

“AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, combined, is a business of about $200 billion in size. The growth rate of over 35-40 percent has come down to 25-26 percent. One needs to see what incremental revenue they are adding,” he said.

“Earlier, when they were growing at 40-50 percent, the size of the top three players together was sub-$100 billion. They were adding $30-40 billion, incrementally. Now at a size of $200 billion, if they are growing at 25 percent, they are still adding $40-50 billion, and the incremental revenue still remains the same,” he explained.",1003,0.3996569335460663

The Nifty IT index has been soaring over the past three trading sessions. It gained 1 percent on February 14, about 1.13 percent on February 15 and 1.71 percent on February 16, with all stocks fuelling the benchmark index higher.

The S&P BSE IT Index has also rallied in tandem, gaining over 3 percent in the past three sessions.

Tech Mahindra and Tata Consultancy Services have been the top gainers among the large-caps, while stock-specific developments propelled the share prices of smaller companies Nucleus Software and Tanla Platforms higher.

A set of in-line quarterly results, moderate deal wins, and ‘buy on dips’ seem to be aiding the sector, analysts said. The Nifty IT index, which was among the worst sectoral performers in 2022, is up over 7 percent for the year, while the benchmark Nifty 50 is down 1 percent.

“A recession view for the developed markets, which was a consensus a few months ago, still holds but with reduced intensity,” Kotak Securities said in a recent report.

Majority of IT companies' revenue is derived from the Americas, and retail sector is the largest business segment for these players followed by financial services. ""The US retail sales data print this week showed a stark recovery which has supported the IT stocks, and additionally, interest rates seem to be nearing their peak with most of the hikes behind us,"" Sreeram Ramdas, vice president at Green Portfolio, said.

Billion dollar deals

Though fears of recession in the US and Europe and reduced client spending continue linger, several large-cap IT companies signed billion-dollar deals in Q3.

According to Bernstein Research, “There is now a divergence of execution between large-caps and mid-caps as large deals intensity has started picking up with clients focusing on vendor consolidation.”

Vendor consolidation means reducing the number of external suppliers to a handful of trusted partners.

In Q3, Wipro signed 11 large deals with a total contract value of over $1 billion. Infosys signed 32 large deals worth $3.3 billion last quarter, the highest in eight quarters. The total contract value for TCS was steady at $7.8 billion.

The Tata group IT firm recently announced a £600-million contract with the UK-based Phoenix Group, which was the largest for TCS in this financial year and its largest in the UK after three years.

Margin recovery

Most IT companies reported sequential improvement in margins in Q3.

According to Moody’s, improving employee utilisation from hiring in prior years and steadily declining attrition will likely arrest further margin pressure.

For stocks under Jefferies’ coverage, aggregate margins recovered by 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 20.6 percent. Midsized firms fared worse, with their aggregate margins down 130 basis points QoQ against a 70 basis point expansion by large-sized IT firms.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Large-caps remain favourites

The Street anticipates the slowdown in global IT spending at about 3-4 percent against 6 percent and 8 percent in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In this backdrop, large-cap IT companies will emerge as winners as there is an “extraordinarily high barrier to sign large deals,” Bernstein said.

“Only six-eight players can compete and win. The ability to structure large billion-dollar deals requires deep understanding of the new technology stack, strengths in integrated service lines, which only large IT services players can provide,” the firm said.

Infosys remains the top pick for analysts and brokerage houses, given its superior revenue growth. Moody’s expects 13 percent revenue growth for Infosys compared to 8 percent revenue growth for TCS in FY23. Moreover, Infosys surprised investors by raising its revenue growth guidance during the Q3 results announcement.

For Jefferies, Infosys is the only pick in the sector. Bernstein analysts have ‘outperform’ ratings on TCS and Tech Mahindra too. They like TCS for its billion-dollar deal playbook and Tech Mahindra for its reasonable valuation. They have ‘market-perform’ ratings for Wipro and HCL Technologies.

Word of caution

The Nifty IT is trading at an above-average premium of 25 percent to the Nifty and valuations remain rich, Jefferies said. It has a cautious stance on the sector.

Kotak Securities said a deep recession is not fully priced in.

“The stocks are at an interesting juncture—moderate upside if it is just a slowdown in developed economies, moderate downside in case of a recession,” it said in a recent report.

When 2023 came knocking, investors were ready for a pause in interest rate hikes, slow cooling off of inflation, decreased volatility in raw material prices and slightly better returns from equity markets. But things don’t always go as planned.

A report by Hindenburg Research, dated January 24, caused mayhem in Adani group stocks, most of them declining over 50 percent in a week’s time. The Nifty 50, which houses Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports, also fell 2.8 percent in that time.

Cautious investors sold shares as the report accused the group of “stock manipulation” and “accounting fraud”. On the flip side, analysts continued to remain positive on Adani Ports, which saw upgrades increase by 3.9 percent in January.

Of the 21 brokerages covering the stock now, it has 20 buy calls and 1 hold call. A month ago, 23 brokerages were covering the stock with 21 buy and 2 hold calls.

The company is on a journey to become India's largest integrated transport utility company by 2030. Though it has a considerable amount of debt (about Rs 42,500 crore as of FY22 end), the management has said that it is building a war chest for the acquisition Container Corporation of India (Concor).

According to foreign brokerage Jefferies, “Follow-ups to the National Logistics’ Policy (NLP), continuing GST (goods and services tax)-driven organised players’ share gain, Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) traffic increase and Concor privatisation should play out for the logistics sector in 2023.”

Its base case scenario for the stock is Rs 995 while the bull case target is Rs 1,330, as the company expands its market share from 14 percent in FY15 to 31 percent by FY25.

The stock got an upgrade from Kotak Institutional Equities to buy from add on January 26, with the target price unchanged at Rs 860 a share. “At its current 11.5x FY2024E EV/EBITDA, the stock provides comfort for any unforeseen risks that may arise over time."" Kotak said in its report.

Another big conglomerate, Reliance Industries, saw its price decrease 8.8 percent in January but upgrades increased by 5.16 percent. Windfall tax and a muted earnings show by the mainstay O2C (oil-to-chemicals) business remain a major overhang on the stock. But analysts believe the Street is not fully pricing in the prospects of Reliance’s retail business and new energy opportunities.

BOB Capital Markets upgraded the stock to a buy rating, raising the target price to Rs 2,840 from Rs 2,670. “We believe listing of the digital services and retail arms will be linked to the achievement of operational milestones that have been delayed by Covid-19. We upgrade as a 12 percent correction since November 2022 opens up an opportunity to enter the stock,” it noted.

Among contrarian downgrades over January, HCL Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro and Tech Mahindra rose 10.46 percent, 7.63 percent, 5.73 percent and 2 percent even as analysts’ pessimism trickled in. The stocks saw ‘buy on dips’ in the month after significant selling last year.

Meanwhile, buy calls are declining for IT stocks as managements have started flagging concerns in the European and US markets. For instance, Antique Stock Broking downgraded Tata Consultancy Services to hold after the third-quarter results, with the target cut to Rs 3,600 from Rs 3,700, citing macroeconomic uncertainties in the US that could pose a downside risk. “Q3 results offer limited reasons to change our cautious view on the sector,” noted most foreign brokerages.

Quarterly change

In quarterly calls, too, Adani Ports topped the list of contrarian upgrades. The other stock that gains prominence is Bajaj Finance. The NBFC stock has corrected 16.9 percent over the last three months, while its buy calls have gone up from 19 to 25. The correction has come on the back of slow growth in AUM (assets under management) and new loans.

But this correction has made the stock attractive for analysts. HDFC Securities upgraded it to Add in January, with a target price of Rs 6,700. “While our concerns on the quality of earnings from the new-to-franchise (NTF) customers and new products remain, the sharp 20 percent correction in the past few months appears at a disconnect from the franchise earnings potential,” the firm said.

Titan’s share price decreased 10.45 percent, but buy calls increased from 25 to 27 in the quarter gone by. The reason for the upgrades is similar to that of Bajaj Finance—a 17 percent correction from peak that has made valuations reasonable.

Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher have recently upgraded the stock to buy and increased FY23/FY24/FY25 earnings per share estimates by 1.5 percent/2 percent/2 percent on the back of strong underlying demand trends across divisions and a correction from the peak.

In contrarian downgrades, apart from IT stocks, HDFC and Hero MotoCorp have made it to the list. The stocks have gained 7.2 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, in the last quarter while buy calls have tumbled.

Investors’ optimism on both the stocks largely arose from anticipated higher consumer spending during the festive season and the period after that, be it discretionary purchases like a two-wheeler or investing in real estate. However, that hasn’t played out according to the script with inflation burning a hole in Indians’ pockets.

Axis Securities downgraded Hero MotoCorp in November from buy to hold. “Rural demand momentum, maintaining a strong share in the entry-level segment and building a product portfolio in the premium segment will be the key challenges in our view for the company,” it said. The number of buy call on the stock has come down to 28 from 32 in the last quarter.

For HDFC, buy calls have come down from 27 to 25, but there are no sell calls on the stock. Nuvama Institutional Equities is the only brokerage with a hold call. “Merger narrative will drive stock price. Historically, entities that have merged have traded at a discount to the merger ratio,” as per Nuvama.

Yearly change

For the 12 months ended January 2023, the list of contrarian upgrades and downgrades were well-balanced.

Here, too, Adani Ports tops the contrarian upgrades list along with Bajaj Finance. Adani Enterprises, too, has seen upgrades but that is because it has gone from 1 hold to 1 buy and 1 hold call.

Then comes HDFC Life that has seen its price fall by 23.42 percent. From 29 buy, 10 hold and 1 sell calls, it now has 25 buy, 3 hold and 3 sell calls. Optically, it looks like an upgrade but the number of analysts covering the stock has also fallen.

Over the past year, HDFC Life’s acquisition of Exide Life was viewed as a positive trigger by the brokerage community. However, the Street did not like the fact that the deal was expensive.

Among recent triggers, taxation on high-value insurance policies that was announced in Budget 2023 has come as a rude shock for the stock.

Tata Motors is the next stock in the contrarian upgrades list with its price falling 11 percent but buy calls going up to 27 from 25. The company had been posting losses for the last seven quarters, but was back in the black in October-December 2022.

CLSA has upgraded its rating on the stock with a buy tag and target price of Rs 512 a share. It expects the Jaguar Land Rover division’s margin profile to improve led by volume growth, and for commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles (PV), business margin to improve on lower commodity costs and price hikes.

""Improvement in volume and margin profile to aid free cash generation in FY24,"" it said.

Apollo Hospitals saw its share price decrease by 9.4 percent but buy call went up to 25 from 23 over the past one year. While the stock fall came on the back of some profit-booking after the significant run-up during COVID-19 years, the upgrades were largely driven by optimism on the hospital chain’s execution.

UBS believes that Apollo Hospitals is executing well on new initiatives, growth and core segments, and that the market is not pricing in an early success of its digital strategy.

Among contrarian downgrades, Coal India stands out. The stock has gained 36.5 percent in the past one year while buy calls have come down to 16 from 21. Downgrades have trickled in as international coal prices are sliding and e-auction premiums are also expected to fall soon. The company’s revised annual wage bill at Rs 46,000 crore will also weigh on its financial performance, pointed out analysts.

JSW Steel and Bharti Airtel’s share price rose 8.5 percent each but buy calls reduced to 19 from 6 and to 27 from 31, respectively.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on February 8 announced the expansion of partnership with existing United Kingdom-based client Phoenix Group in a £600 million ($723 million) deal; it's largest deal win in fiscal year 2023. The IT services major wins this deal in its second-largest global market, despite an increasingly cautious macro environment and uncertainty around client spending.

Phoenix Group is UK's largest long-term savings and retirements provider. This will be TCS' largest deal in the UK in three years.

The deal involves TCS driving synergies and enhance customer experience for life insurance provider ReAssure's policyholders, which Phoenix Group acquired in 2020. The expanded partnership is aimed at transformation of ReAssure’s operations, consolidating the heritage business on TCS BaNCS.

Customer administration and servicing of ReAssure’s 3 million policies will be managed by Diligenta, TCS’ regulated subsidiary in the UK, on behalf of Phoenix Group.

TCS will leverage its Innovation Lab in the UK where its contextual experts and solution architects look for new ways to harness digital technologies to enhance the experience for policyholders, advisers, employers and operational staff, and to continuously improve the service quality for Phoenix Group’s customers.

“Ultimately, this transformation will ensure that Phoenix’s customers benefit from the clear digital focus, consistent customer journeys and customer proposition provided by one platform,” Brid Meaney, CEO of Heritage Division, Phoenix Group, said.

“Customer experience transformation has been cornerstone of the TCS BaNCS platform’s value proposition. Towards this, we have been continuously investing in product and service innovation, setting a benchmark in the UK life and pensions industry,” said R Vivekanand, President, BFSI Products and Platforms at TCS.

Speaking to Moneycontrol post the company's Q3 earnings and commenting on the deal pipeline, CEO Rajesh Gopinathan had said that there is not much change in terms of the mix of deals from a size or a tenure perspective.

There is a slightly more focus on cost being a major lever as opposed to transformation at any cost. There is a lot more sensitivity to the efficiency angle and that holistic view of transformation and efficiency...that's our sweet spot,"" he said. He said that the company wouldn't be competitive if it purely about cost or transformation at any cost as the comapny's model is not optimised for it.

""Strategic, well thought out transformation initiatives which balance both efficiency and transformation, that's our sweet spot and that's what the market is moving towards,"" he said.",402,0.996219684680303

India’s IT companies did not have major demands from the 2023 union budget, with asks primarily focused on the ease of doing business. Barring a few niggles, the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) — the industry body — was satisfied with what the budget delivered.

Companies in the sector cheered the budget, and termed it positive from a technology sector perspective.

As part of her speech for this sector, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman focussed on skilling, 5G, as well as artificial intelligence (AI).

The announcements

The FM said that 100 labs will be set up in engineering institutions to develop applications using 5G services to realise new opportunities, business models, as well as employment opportunities. “The labs will cover, among others, applications such as smart classrooms, precision farming, intelligent transport systems, and health care applications,” she said.

She added that three centres of excellence (CoE) for AI will be set up in top educational institutions. “Leading industry players will partner in conducting interdisciplinary research, and develop cutting-edge applications and scalable solutions in the areas of agriculture, health, and sustainable cities,” she added.

The government also plans to set up a scheme — the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.0 — to skill youth in the next three years.

“On-job training, industry partnership, and alignment of courses with industry needs will be emphasised. The scheme will also cover new-age courses for Industry 4.0, like coding, AI, robotics, mechatronics, IOT (internet of things), 3D printing, drones, and soft skills. To skill youth for international opportunities, 30 Skill India International Centres will be set up across different states,” the Finance Minister stated.

What NASSCOM thinks

In a statement, NASSCOM said that the budget focused on three key transformational trends that will help India build its competitive advantage — digital transformation, energy transformation, and supply chain resilience. “The budget outlines India’s plan to become an engine for global growth and deploy digital technology to lead India’s development,” it said.

It added that the budget called out the role of technology in almost all major announcements, and that the creation of 5G labs “will further help in opening newer avenues and opportunities, scaling up new business models and employment prospects.

“The government’s focus on not just building COEs to drive AI development in India, but also on making AI and data work for India will be critical in building the core design principles of AI innovation for a diverse nation like India,” NASSCOM said.

In a discussion with NASSCOM President Debjani Ghosh, the industry body’s Public Policy head, Ashish Aggarwal, pointed out one concern that could impact IT companies.

Since a lot of IT companies work out of Special Economic Zones (SEZ), a change proposed in the Finance Bill, 2023, is that foreign exchange earnings have to be brought back into the country within six months. This, Aggarwal said, is something that needs to be discussed and analysed from an industry point of view as it could be a challenge.

Among NASSCOM’s asks was a timeline for the conclusion of advance pricing agreements, which are used to resolve transfer pricing issues before a transaction takes place. Aggarwal said that on that front, the budget’s focus on addressing the backlog of appeals is going to be very useful.

“We had asked them to put a binding timeline, but they're putting their efforts into building capacity to handle these cases. I think that's very good,’’ he said.

Company reactions

Tata Consultancy Services CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said that the budget builds on the government’s focus on enhancing digital infrastructure.

“The provisions for research in AI and 5G implementation, and the government's vision of Make AI in India and Make AI Work for India are commendable. Bringing in the National Data Governance policy is also a welcome step. Overall, it's a forward-looking budget that will fortify the digital spine of the country,” he said.

Accenture India Chairperson Rekha Menon said that there was a strong focus on the knowledge economy with technology as the bedrock for boosting socio-economic growth and green development.

“While agriculture, healthcare, and sustainable cities are the current focus of the CoEs, India has multidimensional potential – AI can add an estimated $450-$500 billion to India’s GDP by 2025, more than 60 percent of which will be from four key sectors – financial services, consumer packaged goods & retail, healthcare, and industrials & automotive. India will need to continue to invest in these CoEs to keep pace with the evolving asks across all sectors,” she said.

Jagdish Mitra, Chief Strategy Officer, Tech Mahindra, called it a positive budget from a technology sector perspective, and added that it sends the right message about 5G labs, AI CoEs, and the focus around skilling. This, he said, “is absolutely the key need for the country as we live through the Prime Minister’s vision of technology being the core enabler.”

He also said it was commendable that steps were taken around the ease of doing business.

SAP Labs India SVP and MD Sindhu Gangadharan said that the budget underlines the imperative of job creation and youth upliftment through the PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.

“In line with this, the establishment of 30 Skill India International Centres across states will be critical to developing and nurturing the digital talent pool in the country. Additionally, the launch of the National Data Governance Policy and three CoEs for AI are initiatives that will help further cement India’s position as the global innovation hub. In fact, the launch of 5G labs will create new avenues of opportunities through the network’s rapid and efficient expansion,” she said.

WNS Group CEO Keshav Murugesh also said that the establishment of three CoEs for AI, and the National Data Governance policy “will strengthen India’s position as a global innovation hub.” He added that the launch of 5G labs will act as a catalyst to drive faster and better expansion of the network, creating more avenues for innovation.

L&T Tech Services CEO Amit Chadha said that the budget has focussed on boosting digital infra and adoption, which he termed a positive sign for the tech industry.

“As a pure-play ER&D services provider, our belief is that such mass enablement of digital transformation and innovation will unlock the full potential of the Indian engineering and technology sector, helping the country maintain its position as a globally preferred destination for engineering services,” he said.

LTIMindtree CEO Debashis Chatterjee said that the budget underscores the growing significance of cloud, data, AI, and other new-age technologies in governance, “while also taking a big step forward in simplifying processes and improving the ease of doing business.”

“The budget’s emphasis on digitisation and trust-based governance will open new opportunities for the IT sector to leverage its globally-acknowledged technology strengths to make a difference here,” he said.

He added that industry players partnering with educational institutions for interdisciplinary research and AI and 5G applications will create “a win-win proposition for both.”

“Building upon the earlier vision with a more structured development of Tier 2 and 3 cities, the budget will further enhance our ability to capitalise on an expanded talent pool, which is vital to the long-term sustainability and scalability of the IT services industry in India. Overall, the budget underscores India’s potential of becoming a global benchmark in technology-led transformation,” he said.",1247,0.7783386613193312

Thinking of investing in foreign stocks, mutual funds and crypto currencies abroad or collecting artwork and high-value items investments such as property and sculptures? Be ready to shell out a higher amount as the Budget 2023-24 has enhanced the tax-collection at source (TCS) on foreign remittance through Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) to 20 percent from the existing 5 percent.

For the benefit of students studying abroad and those opting for medical treatment, the TCS rate has been kept untouched at 5 percent of the amount remitted. But investments, gifts and foreign tours exceeding Rs 7 lakh in a year would be impacted starting July 1, 2023.

Who will be impacted?

Indian residents are allowed to remit up to $250,000 per financial year to make investments, study abroad or undergo medical procedures.

“This would increase the cash outflow immediately for any foreign remittances for any other purposes (other than education and medical treatment) by any resident individuals under liberalised remittance scheme,” says Dr Suresh Surana, Founder, RSM India.

Apart from the areas safeguarded, many other investment areas would be affected.

“Investing in immovable or movable assets abroad such as property, foreign stocks, mutual funds, bonds abroad or even cryptocurrency would come under the purview of 20 percent TCS. So, if I was investing Rs 100, now I would have to allocate Rs 120 for the same, which is a huge jump,” said chartered accountant Mehul Sheth.

LIVE Updates on Budget 2023 here

Earlier, 20 percent of TCS was applicable only in high-value transactions, where PAN was not available.

Ananth Reddy, founder and MD of Electrum Financial Services, which is engaged in foreign exchange services, said speculative high-value purchases of art and stocks would not be affected so much as these involve ultra-high net worth individuals, with high disposable income. “But the tourism industry would be highly impacted.”

Why the increase?

When the rupee value has been decelerating, the move would help the government step on the gas. “It is a move to conserve foreign exchange amidst global uncertainty and the steep rise in TCS rates would force people to rethink remittances,” said Reddy.

While the documentation process would not be affected as the purpose for remitting and the amount were being tracked at the bank level before remitting the funds, the amount declared under the income tax returns would increase due to the rise in tax collection rate.

“Though, the LRS scheme has been crafted in a way to provide flexibility for remittance abroad but with this increased cost, it seems the intention of the Government is to keep a tab on such remittances with the income declared in the corresponding tax returns filed,” says Saurrav Sood, Practice Leader – International Tax & Transfer Pricing, SW India.

Operating numbers beat estimates. The IT services company has clocked a 0.9% sequential growth in consolidated profit at Rs 1,297 crore for quarter ended December FY23, with revenue rising 4.6% QoQ to Rs 13,735 crore, beating analysts' estimates. Revenue in dollar terms grew by 1.8% QoQ to $1,668 million with constant currency revenue growth at 0.2%. Operating numbers were ahead of expectations while deal wins at $795 million for the quarter.

IT services firm Tech Mahindra's employee headcount declined by 6,844 in the third quarter ended December 31, 2022, joining peers such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Wipro, as software firms go slow on hiring in an increasingly cautious macro environment.

The total headcount for Q3 stood at 157,068, down 4.2 percent from 163,912 in the quarter ended September. A similar trend was noticed with peers TCS and Wipro too in Q3, whose headcount dropped by 2,197 and 435, respectively.

Tech Mahindra's attrition rate (last twelve month basis) plunged to 17 percent in Q3FY23, down from 20 percent in the September quarter. The rate was also down from 24 percent in the year-ago quarter.

The firm has been seeing a drop in attrition rate since the first quarter of FY23 after a steady increase in the five quarters before that.

The company added 5,877 new staff in Q2FY23 and 3,874 in Q3FY23.

Rohit Anand, CFO, Tech Mahindra said, ""For the last three quarters, we have reduced attrition rates based on our internal actions and market behaviour. We take this metric very seriously. We are now looking at having the the lowest attrition rate in the industry.""

""If you see, the headcount has gone down QoQ. Most of this was on the back of BPS (business process services) segment and quarterly seasonal ramp down that happened based on the increase that was there last year. The current IT growth environment is reflective of this headcount reduction as well as our endeavour to improve our utilisation,"" he added.

Vivek Agarwal, President – BFSI, HLS and Corporate Development, Tech Mahindra said, ""We can continue to be better performers of attrition rate in the industry and this is due to the steps we have taken in the last three-four quarters from retention perspective. But clearly the demand scenario is not as robust as it was two quarters back, hence we have already read about the hi-tech companies becoming more cautious on hiring, and that is easing supply side challenges to a large extent.""

""So given the uncertainties in the market, we are trying out just in time hiring,"" he added.

Speaking to Moneycontrol earlier this month at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, CEO and MD CP Gurnani said that when the attrition was higher, so was the hiring and vice versa in the current situation.

“Hiring cannot always be linear. The reality is that AI, data, and automation are part of our lives. If it is not linear, revenue goes up. If you don't hire, please do take into account that we are becoming more efficient with automation,” he had said.

India’s top four IT companies hired 1,940 employees on a net basis in the third quarter of FY23, down 93 percent from the previous quarter.

The net addition by Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, and HCLTech had fallen 45 percent to 28,836 employees in the second quarter from the first quarter, when 52,842 employees were recruited.

The declining trend in headcount addition comes as the IT sector faces a cautionary demand environment, a challenging environment in certain verticals in major markets such as North America and Europe, and a slowdown in discretionary spends. Although a slowing hiring trend is often considered an indicator of easing demand, top executives of IT companies maintained this is not the case.

TCS said its headcount dropped by 2,197 employees from the previous quarter, while Wipro said there was a reduction of 435 employees. This was the first time in 10 quarters that the headcount at the end of a quarter for both companies was lower than in the previous quarter.

Infosys added 1,627 employees and HCLTech hired 2,945 employees, the most among the four companies. The net headcount of Infosys, TCS and Wipro has declined in each quarter of FY23.

The companies attributed the lower or negative net headcount addition in the third quarter to talent investments they made previously and said they are now working to make that talent productive.

Since Q1 of FY21, when all companies reported a net reduction in their headcount, their hiring has increased significantly thanks to unprecedented pandemic-accelerated demand for digital transformation. Following the reduction in headcount in April-June 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic, the net addition of the four companies increased dramatically between Q2 of FY21 and Q4 of FY22.

The four companies cumulatively added 17,076 employees in Q2 of FY21. By Q4 of FY22, it stood at 79,614.

In the case of TCS, chief human resources officer Milind Lakkad said the company invested in fresh talent as well as in talent development to make them productive, and that investment coupled with tightening led to a negative headcount.

""That does not indicate anything on the demand side. Demand is high, we are just operating very efficiently right now,"" he claimed.

Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said the company wants to ensure that all the talent it has hired is trained and ready to be deployed. Parekh said the company’s quarterly annualised attrition is trending downwards and in Q3 of FY23 it was at the lowest in seven quarters.

Over the past four quarters, HCLTech added 11,000 employees in Q4 of FY22, which dipped to 2,089 in Q1 of FY23, spiked to 8,359 in Q2 of FY23 and again declined to 2,945 in Q3 of FY23. Chief financial officer Prateek Aggarwal said the company has focussed on hiring freshers and lateral hiring has reduced.

Addressing the press after the company’s earnings last week, chief people officer Ramachandran Sundararajan said net addition is a function of attrition and campus hiring in the previous quarter, when they took in a higher number of freshers. He said gross hiring will be moderated when there is a significant drop in attrition.

Asked if this was an indicator of demand, he said it looks at net headcount addition on a rolling 12-month basis and projecting a one-quarter snapshot for future quarters may not give the true picture.

“We need to look at it on a trailing 12-month basis, so I don't see this as an indication of any moderation to growth,” he said.

Attrition has been moderating as well, with a decline visible on a trailing 12-month basis.

Fresher addition

On fresher hiring, Sundararajan said that HCLTech hired over 22,000 freshers in FY23 and will get close to the target of 30,000 freshers for the year.

“We may fall slightly marginally below that [fresher hiring target] and that's a moderation that we're doing because of the improvements in the retention rates… The extent to which we have seen attrition drop quarter-on-quarter for the last couple of quarters, I think that's significant and it is very encouraging,” Sundararajan said.

Wipro, which initially set a target of 30,000 freshers for the year, is expected to close with hiring 22,000 freshers. It added 3,000 freshers in Q3, and about 5,000 are expected to be added in Q4.

Wipro’s CHRO Saurabh Govil told Moneycontrol that the company had invested in talent ahead of time and has low utilisation.

“We have a bench (strength), where utilisation can go up. We have headspace of four or five percentage points by utilisation. We are hiring and training them and keeping them ready to manage demand. From a supply-chain perspective, we don't see a challenge,” Govil said.

Infosys hired about 6,000 freshers during the quarter, and TCS around 7,000.

Campus hiring in FY23 is expected to be significantly lower than last year, according to Saran Balasundaram, CEO of tech recruitment firm Han Digital. “Last year, about 4.8-5.2 lakh were successfully hired. This financial year, successful campus hires will not be more than 3.8 lakh,” he said.

Anshuman Das, CEO of Careernet, expects campus hiring in calendar 2023 to be hit as companies honour offers they have already made.

“A lot of the company's campus hiring plans are reasonably muted, 50-60 percent down from last year’s number,” he said.

Based on the current hiring, intent and mood, all types of hiring is impacted, said TeamLease Digital CEO Sunil Chemmankotil.

“I don't think they will considerably reduce fresher hiring but it will definitely not be to the tune of what they hired last year. Somewhere around 3 lakh hiring will still happen in freshers,” he said.

New normal?

Lateral hiring, too, has reduced, Balasundaram said. There were 1.3 million job changes in FY22 and in the first three quarters of FY23, there have not been more than 800,000 job shifts, he said.

“The job churn will be less than 1 million this financial year (FY23), which is about a 30 percent dip from last year,” he said.

He added that attrition backfills are taking a backseat, particularly as companies align their hiring requirements with people taken from campuses.

Das of Careernet said a lot of the hiring used to happen for attrition. However, he doesn’t expect a scenario where hiring slows down further, and said it has hit the bottom of the curve. While he said there will be more clarity in the next three months, he expects it to start rising by April.

Chemmankotil said companies went overboard in some areas when the market was bullish and those attritions are not getting refilled.

“When you have a good prospect base, a lot of service companies hire in excess because they would want to showcase the capability to a prospect,” he said.

Now, since discretionary spending is slowing down, companies may not backfill all attrition, he said. About 20 percent of all IT spend happens for legacy system replacements with the latest technology, but those budgets can be deferred, he said. The remaining 80 percent is when they work on actively building products and maintenance.

“There they will refill, but I think since discretionary spend budgets are not at the same level as what it was in the previous year, refills may not happen to that extent,” he said.

Han Digital’s Balasundaram expects a revival in the hiring market only by the third quarter of FY24.",1229,-0.49345534294843674

In an interview with Moneycontrol’s Chandra R Srikanth on the sidelines of the WEF, NGS said that customers believe that aside from the war, things are falling into place and that they see the light at the end of the tunnel.

“Most of them tell me that technology is something that is important—whether it is growth, efficiency, innovation, anything that they want to do—technology is important. So in that context, the last 48 hours, I'm feeling good,” he said. However, one has to wait to see how this will translate into IT budgets for the year, which the company’s clients are expected to firm up soon.

“We have done well in North America, in the UK. Europe is the only one where we had some amount of tentativeness. But whosoever I see, they all feel that winter has been generally warm. Germany is actually quite warmer than expected. So they all believe that the energy crisis, which they were anticipating may not be that much of a problem. That itself is a big boost for them. They're optimistic, then it gives us more room for optimism,” he said.

Commenting on the net headcount reduction in the December quarter across the industry including TCS, NGS attributed it to a couple of factors. The first was that companies went to hire a lot of people due to the increased demand, that demand now slowing down, particularly in Europe and a seasonally weak quarter for IT companies led to companies having excess capacity.

“The focus has shifted to better utilisation, improving that realization. I think our attrition rates coming down, and hiring is getting moderated or going back to the levels at which we are used to hiring in pre-pandemic times, which means that the rhythm that we used to have before the pandemic is something that we will get there in 2023,” he said.

TCS has seen its attrition starting to moderate on a trailing twelve-month basis sequentially, but also ended the December quarter with 1,627 fewer employees than in September 2022.

Return to work

In September 2022, TCS informed employees that they were mandated to return to work for three days a week based on a roster. As things currently stand, the COO said that 2.1 lakh of the company’s 6.13 lakh employees — or about a third of their workforce — now works from office for at least three days a week, a figure he said they were happy with.

“Most employees when they come and see the office environment, how they get benefited by this, they tend to come more often. I think this flexibility to the workforce, the hybrid model, the collaborative way of working is important,” he said.

He added that they have got the model right when it comes to working collaboratively, but that it was sad to see TCS employees who have never been to the office exit the company.

“Our emphasis is to see that they come to work, come to the office, and build a career for the long term. Once you get to the rhythm of working in TCS, then you know, it doesn't matter where you work. But initial integration needs to happen by coming to the office,” he said.",584,0.01754974325497945

The tech earnings season began with large IT companies -- Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies -- declaring their Q3 report card this week, amid analysts' gloomy prognosis around slowdown in advanced economies and fear of geopolitical flare-ups.

The industry leaders said they are keeping a close watch on the global economy and cues.

Overall, the revenue growth band of the top-tier IT players was pegged at between 14-20 per cent for Q3FY23, compared to the year ago period. Seen sequentially, the topline growth for the large IT pack ranged between three per cent and eight per cent versus previous September quarter.

Meanwhile, December-quarter net profit of the top IT deck rose between three per cent (Wipro) to 19 per cent (HCL Tech) year-on-year; and about 4 per cent (TCS) to 17 per cent (HCL Tech) when computed on a sequential basis.

TCS' overall revenue rose 19.1 per cent to Rs 58,229 crore for the reporting quarter. The chief executive and managing director of India's largest IT services company Rajesh Gopinathan said the firm is more confident about the North American and British operations, which account for two-thirds of its revenues, but there are short-term uncertainties, and it is Europe, which needs closer monitoring as geopolitical tensions restrict clients from making IT spends.

TCS management talked of ""slow"" decision making in Europe, and said it is ""fairly constructive"" when it comes to markets like the US, although it is keeping a close watch on how things play out over next couple of quarters.

The conversations with customers are much more balanced ones, ""where they are equally positive as well as cautious"" yielding opportunities of ""a mix of both cost and transformation deals"".

Chief operating officer N Ganapathy Subramaniam said the deal momentum and pipeline are looking good, and the overall situation on technology spending seems to be intact even in this environment.

Infosys posted a 20.2 per cent year-on-year increase in consolidated revenue for December quarter at Rs 38,318 crore, and surprised many by hiking full year revenue guidance to 16-16.5 per cent.

Infosys' consolidated net profit rose to Rs 6,586 crore during October-December 2022 as against Rs 5,809 crore a year back, translating into 13.4 per cent increase. Sequentially, the net profit was 9.4 per cent higher than September quarter.

The company raised its annual sales forecast on a strong deal pipeline, but in the same breath, it warned of ""constraints"" in certain verticals amid slowing global economy.

Infosys called out mortgage, investment banking, telecom and hi-tech, saying these segments were ""more impacted, leading to delays in decision making and uncertainty in spending."" The company was, however, quick to add that sectors like energy, utilities and manufacturing continue to see traction.

Moreover, the concerns are more pronounced in Europe than the US, the Bengaluru-based IT bellwether said.

""We see in the European markets, more concerns on what's going on with the economy... and the US market is also there, but relatively less so in the US with respect to Europe. We will see how this plays out,"" Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said during the Q3 results conference.

Smaller rival Wipro has talked of potential slowdown in retail sector in its earnings' roundup. The management's talking points also touched upon ""bit of a lag for conversion of bookings"" and ""certain level of volatility from customers in particular sectors regarding discretionary spendings."" Wipro Ltd on Friday reported a better-than-expected 2.8 per cent rise in consolidated net profit for the December 2022 quarter to Rs 3,053 crore and exuded optimism about ""strong"" bookings for the fourth quarter despite global headwinds.

The company's Q4 guidance, however, came below analysts' expectations. Wipro said its IT services revenue is expected to grow in the range of -0.6 per cent to 1 per cent sequentially in constant currency in the quarter ending March 2023.

Wipro expects revenue from the IT services business for the full year to be in the range of 11.5-12 per cent in constant currency terms.

The revenues of Wipro stood at Rs 23,229 crore in Q3FY23, 14.3 per cent higher than the same period previous year.

Noida-headquartered HCL Tech posted a 19 per cent increase in the consolidated net income to Rs 4,096 crore for just-ended third quarter.

Its consolidated revenue grew by 19.56 per cent to Rs 26,700 crore during the reported quarter, from Rs 22,331 crore in the December 2021 quarter.

HCL Tech narrowed current fiscal growth guidance in the range of 13.5-14 per cent for the overall revenue in constant currency terms and margin to 18-18.5 per cent.

""Looking ahead, we believe there is a near term impact to a few industries, specifically technology industry clients, as they optimise while they will end up as great growth opportunities in medium term with the right propositions,"" C Vijayakumar, CEO of HCL Tech, said.

He added: ""Looking ahead we remain positive of our medium term growth, a confidence generated by our good booking and pipeline across every segment.""",870,0.4999888340632121

Indian IT services company HCLTech, formerly HCL Technologies, added 2,945 employees in the third quarter ended December 31, 2022. The total headcount of the company at present stands at 222,270.

This is lower than the previous quarter's net addition of over 8,359 employees in Q2, but significantly lower than the 10,143 employees hired in the same quarter last fiscal.

The attrition rate decreased significantly on a QoQ basis at 21.7 percent, down from 23.8 percent in Q2 on last twelve months (LTM) basis, the company said, adding that this attrition figure excludes involuntary attrition and digital process operations. But it is much higher than 19.8 percent in the same quarter last fiscal.

HCLTech laid off 350 employees working on Microsoft's news-related products during the second quarter after the project was not renewed.

Fresher addition for the quarter came in at 5,892, which was lower than the 10,339 for Q2.

During Q1FY23 earnings call, CEO and MD C Vijayakumar had said that the company overall plans to add about 30,000 freshers this fiscal.

""In the first three quarters we have added more than 22,000 freshers. We will get pretty close to our 30,000 target by Q4, but may be marginally missing the target number. That's a moderation we are doing because of the improvement in retention rates. The extent of drop we have seen in attrition rates over the past few quarters is significant,"" Ram Sundararajan, chief people officer at HCLTech said while addressing the media.

Hiring targets

The company previously said that it intends to hire 45,000 new employees in FY23. It also heavily outsourced employees from new frontier locations such as Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Romania, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Brazil.

Meanwhile, rival Infosys added 1,627 employees, a significant decrease from the 10,032 previous quarter.

HCL Technologies is all set to report its October-December earnings numbers on January 12 and analysts are forecasting a 3 percent sequential growth in constant currency (CC) terms, which is likely to be greater than its peers.

TCS reported CC revenue growth of 2.2 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), while Infosys is expected to clock 1.1 percent QoQ.

According to a poll of brokerages, consolidated revenue might come in at Rs 26,026 crore, registering 16.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth, while consolidated profit after tax (PAT) is expected to increase 10.6 percent YoY to Rs 3,796 crore.

​

At its investor day held on December 8 in New York, the company’s management had flagged off that Q3 FY23 will see higher-than-expected furloughs, with BFSI and hi-tech being the problem areas.

Analysts are pegging earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin at 18.9 percent for the quarter. This indicates a near 95-basis-point (bps) expansion. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

If it weren’t for the furloughs, margin expansion could have been greater on the back of rupee depreciation and a slight shift in revenue mix towards the higher-margin Products & Platforms (P&P) business, said analysts at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.

Meanwhile, Kotak Institutional Equities is forecasting 12.7 percent sequential CC growth in products business and 14 percent decline on YoY comparison. On the other hand, services segment is seen clocking 2 percent CC growth QoQ.

“The Products and platforms segment might report a sharp rebound sequentially, driven by seasonal strength. Overall growth will be aided by this segment,” according to analysts at Emkay Global and Nomura.

Coming to deal wins, the total contract value might be flat in Q3 FY23 around $2 billion, compared to $2.38 billion recorded in the previous quarter. As indicated earlier by the management, the company believes it will continue to win deals in North America while Europe may see some slowdown.

In the intra-quarter update, top brass said they expect revenue growth to be at the lower end of the 13.5-14.5 percent band for FY23 and this guidance is likely to be maintained, said analysts.

Other key monitorables are:

- Impact on discretionary businesses, i.e., products and engineering and R&D services (ERS) in the event of recession

- Pricing environment and attrition

- Outcome of clients’ budgeting process

- Levers to increase margins

- Large deal activity in the market

There were over-excitement and mindless purchases of cloud services amid a pandemic-fuelled digital transformation and cloud-migration activities, said Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) CEO & MD Rajesh Gopinathan. Cloud service was one of the key drivers of strong demand and deal pipeline for TCS in the third quarter of FY23.

In an interview with Moneycontrol, Gopinathan said this in response to whether enterprises are reassessing cloud spending given the current macro economic challenges and trends of over spending on cloud last year for even basic workloads.

“There definitely has been over excitement on Cloud, and some amount of mindless purchases and mindless commitments. And I think people over-simplified the cloud proposition, saying that if I migrate to the cloud, I'm going to get a very variable-sized cost base. And it is going to be cheaper than my capex cycle,” he said.

The CEO added, “Technically, the ‘variablisation’ is true. But to get to that variablisation, you need to do the transformation of your application because just lifting your application from a datacentre kind of setup, and putting it into a cloud will not automatically get you a variablisation.”

Gopinathan explained that to migrate to the cloud mindfully, the companies would first need to modify or architect their existing applications accordingly, and that will require a certain amount of initial investment. Without this, cloud migration could be a “net costlier proposition.”

This will then lead to specific project-led cloud spending by companies, in an attempt to bring down cloud costs.

“Once you have architected it, it actually unleashes a second round of transformation, which is the right reason to go to the cloud. You can open up your architecture for much more composable functionality so that as your business model shifts, you will be able to move faster with it, or your upgrade cycles will be faster,” he said.

Gopinathan said that TCS is uniquely positioned when it comes to moving to the next phase of digital transformation, and has seen over two years of demand spike and cloud migration. From both cost optimisation and phase two of transformation deals perspective, TCS will be in a position to benefit in terms of deal wins.

Ultimately, he said, “Leaving all of it aside for an enterprise, the cloud is a much safer, much more reliable, and much more secure environment. So, enterprises are much better off in the cloud than in the data centre. But there is work to be done to realise the cost-benefit.”

Sharing his outlook on growth drivers for deal wins during TCS’ Q3 earnings announcement, Gopinathan said that a lot of work is happening on the cloud as a lot has been invested into it already.

“From actual project work related to the cloud, there's quite a lot of work yet to be done. We are very strongly participating in that. You can consider whether to call it digital transformation or not. But it is truly transformative. And that will continue well into the year,” he said.

N Ganapathy Subramaniam, COO, TCS added, “Tech spending is holding up specifically in terms of large deals related to cloud transformation.",523,0.9997751235961914

The Indian services sector is happy where it stands as it has been centered in the government's agenda, TCS chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan says days before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to table the Union Budget for 2023-24.

“The government has made sure that the services sector, which earlier used to be lost, is now fair and centered in the government's agenda. We are quite happy as an industry where we are,” Gopinathan told Moneycontrol.

In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol after the company’s third-quarter earnings, Gopinathan was asked about his Budget wish list from the government. “Why waste Christmas writing a letter, when Santa is ready to do something? If you were good, you will get your gift,” he said.

Gopinathan said that earlier a stable currency regime and tax regime have been part of the company’s Budget wish list, which the central bank has been focusing on lately. The TCS chief added the government has also been 'quite supportive' of the sector, through the pandemic, and in various FTA (Free trade agreement) negotiations.

Moneycontrol earlier reported ahead of the Union Budget 2023, industry body National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) has made three key recommendations to aid the Information Technology and IT-enabled Services (ITeS) industries in ease of doing business. They pertain to the per diem allowance threshold, safe harbor rules, and advance pricing agreements.

TCS earnings, reported on January 9, for the third quarter ended December were broadly in-line, with constant currency revenue growth of 2.2 percent quarter on-quarter and EBIT margins of 24.5 percent. However, deal wins were weak at $7.8 billion versus $8.1 billion in the previous quarter and the headcount fell sequentially by over 2,000. While the management was confident about demand in North America and the UK, Europe outlook remained uncertain.

This is despite a challenging business environment, where TCS had fewer deal wins, but still managed to beat expectations on the revenue front.

“A decision has been taken to pay 100% of the Quarterly Variable Allowance (QVA) for all employees up to C2 or equivalent grades covered under this plan,” said the email accessed by Moneycontrol. These include trainees and IT analysts.

For mid and senior-level employees, the individual variable payout is based on business unit performance. “The individual pay-out for C3A or equivalent grades and above (as applicable) may vary, depending on the business unit performance,” a note by Lakkad said. C3A and above grades are assistant consultant, associate consultant and consultant, senior and principal consultant.

TCS paid out 100 percent of variable pay to junior-level employees during the previous quarter as well.

TCS did not respond to Moneycontrol's queries.

Chief Financial Officer Samir Seksaria told reporters after the earnings that supply-side challenges are abating, and the elevated expectations of salaries along with backfilling expenses coming down was helping on the margin front.

""TCS has given a muted quarter where despite the growth in revenue from operations, the same is not reflected in the profitability. The last quarter of the fiscal remains a key watch out as the macro-economic environment changes will bring clarity across economies,"" Urmi Shah, Analyst at Samco Securities, said.

India's largest IT services company, TCS, reported an 11 per cent rise in December quarter net profit to Rs 10,846 crore, restricted by a narrowing of profit margins, but sounded sanguine about the deal pipeline.

Its overall revenue rose 19.1 per cent to Rs 58,229 crore for the reporting quarter, but it was a 0.5 per cent narrowing of the operating profit margin to 24.5 per cent that limited the overall profit growth.

Tata Consultancy Services' net headcount reduction in Q3FY23 must be seen in the context of the pandemic's demand spike period in 2021, as well as the trainees it has now deployed, CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said in an interview with Moneycontrol's Chandra R Srikanth. This comes as the company reported its first net headcount decrease in ten quarters amid a challenging demand environment.

According to Gopinathan, the company doubled its typical trainee intake during the quarters of increased demand in the 2021 calendar year.

“In fiscal year 2021, when the industry went through a demand spike, we had called it early that we expect the demand will return strongly by December 2020, and onwards. We significantly increased campus offers and off-campus hiring in the 2021 calendar year. When I say significantly, we had more than doubled our typical intake,” he said, adding that the company invested at the bottom of the pyramid, trained them, and deployed them simultaneously to backfill peak attrition rates.

In the seven quarters preceding FY23, the company’s net addition had increased each quarter to keep pace with the demand.

In Q3FY23, TCS' headcount closed down 2,197 employees from the previous quarter. The last time the headcount addition was in the negative was in Q1FY21, during the first wave of the pandemic. As of December 31, 2022, the company had 6,13,974 employees on its rolls.

Explaining the headcount reduction, Gopinathan said that between December 2021 to December 2022 period, the company had added between 55,000-60,000 employees on a net basis.

In 2021, he said they decided to bring in all their trainees in two quarters rather than spreading it throughout the year, and took in 35,000 freshers, he said.

“We tested whether we'll be able to absorb it, and how does it play out for us? We had done such experiments a couple of years before the pandemic and then went on to a normal cycle. So we knew that we could flex this system,” he said.

He added that headcount growth in 2021 was ahead of revenue growth, and that headcount growth in 2021 and 2022 together is roughly in line with revenue.

However, the period during which TCS doubled its campus hires intake was also marked by elevated attrition levels across the industry.

Gopinathan said that TCS’ approach was that as attrition increased, they must invest at the bottom of the pyramid and train them so that the company has the people available to backfill that attrition.

“At the peak attrition levels, we needed to be much more focused on lateral recruitment to backfill it. But what is really happening is the pool that we hired in calendar 2021, is becoming much more productive. And we are backfilling attrition using that pool, rather than lateral,” he said.

Now, Gopinathan said that they will resume their regular hiring cycle.

Attrition too has begun to moderate. While it was 21.3 percent in Q3FY23 (down from 21.5 percent the previous quarter), the company's management stated that quarterly annualised attrition has decreased by nearly 6%.

The company hired around 7,000 freshers in Q3FY23, taking the total number of freshers hired this fiscal to around 42,000.

Gopinathan said that attrition is not backfilled from the current hiring but from previous hiring, internal resources and lateral hiring.

“As attrition comes into control our ability to backfill attrition with internally trained resources increases. When attrition peaks, you need to backfill laterally. But we are able to do that,” he said.

He added that attrition moderating is important for TCS’ business model.

“It improves operational stability as delivery quality, customer satisfaction, everything is high when attrition is low. It's very critical to our business model, plus the cost benefit of that. When you're doing lateral hiring in a much accelerated manner, price points become unreasonable. Now it is much more rational,” he said.

During the analyst call too, Gopinathan stated that the hiring trend should be more normal from here on, with a gross employee addition of 1.25-1.5 lakh expected for the year. Along with lower attrition rates, he added that this will give the company enough capacity to handle growth, and they can bring in talent on a short-term basis depending on demand.

Gopinathan was confident about double-digit growth will return to the industry, even as analysts have predicted a great reset for the IT sector after a period of aggressive pandemic growth and hiring.

In an interview with Moneycontrol after the company’s third-quarter earnings, he was upbeat about growth from a medium to long-term perspective.

On whether things will get worse before it gets better, Gopinathan said, “I think the answer to that is no, it’s likely to stay where it is. And then probably get better is our expectation. The current hesitancy will continue for some time and from there it will improve.”

“The US especially, the whole macroeconomic situation is likely to be for a shorter period. And by the time we are a few months or a quarter two into the next year, we should see a much-improved outlook and return to more normal growth rates there.”

On whether TCS will outpace global IT spend, he said, “Absolutely. It is not just vendor consolidation, it is higher market share in incremental spend. On both sides, I believe we are very well positioned. So, we think that we will participate and gain share on both sides on the incremental spend, and on the existing spend.”

In terms of growth rate, while TCS is expected to end FY23 with a growth rate of over 13%, analysts at Kotak expect a moderation in growth in FY24 to 8.1% amid an increasingly slowing demand environment.

On whether 8 percent will be the new normal or if the company will return to double-digit growth, Gopinathan said, “If you think about where that negativity is coming from, one, it is coming from a geopolitical situation, which is unlikely to be the new normal in Europe. If you look at it from the US perspective, the transition between cheap money and costly money, the transition is what is creating the current volatility, it is not that it is not one or the other”

“So, this year, the immediate negativity that is coming, are both of transient nature. How long will that transiency last? And that is, you know, we have a perspective that in US, it will be much shorter and in Europe, it is likely to weaken similar to what where the market is. But this is not the new normal”, he said that he is confident that growth will return to double digits.

He added that what is underlying the confidence is that the technology cycle has moved decisively towards a new, cloud-based architecture, which still has huge headroom for growth. He further said that there is a plethora of new things which gives even more credence that business models will become even more technology dependent, and even more deeply embedded in technology.

“So medium to long term. Absolutely, we see a very positive outcome. US will resolve itself automatically during the course of the year. The European side of it, hopefully will get resolved this year”, he said.

TCS’ earnings for the third quarter ended December were broadly in-line, with constant currency revenue growth of 2.2% quarter on quarter and EBIT margins of 24.5%.

Tata Consultancy Services CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, while speaking to Moneycontrol, listed what have been the changes as he evolved from being a Chief Financial Officer to the leader of the company in a span of 10 years.

On his 10-year-journey in the company, this being his 40th earnings report, Gopinathan said: “I think we have been fairly successful, that we've been continuously able to move in the direction that we want to move, but we have not lost intensity on that cycle. So getting a better appreciation of that, and having the confidence and satisfaction of having done it for an extended period of time. I think that's what I would say that is my thoughts on the 10 years.”

“The things that we're trying not to change is to keep the intensity high. Because it's easy to rationalize what happens, but always pushing me to be slightly more than where it is currently,” Gopinathan added speaking about how the company functions.

On what keeps the company going strong, he said: “People keep on asking, why don't you? You know, that situation is bad, why don't you lower your target? Why don't you cut yourself some room, we have always believed that the philosophy should be that, you know, it's like, there used to be an old paper called strategy as stretch. So you need to keep your targets slightly outside the realm of what you can easily reach, and then keep moving towards that. So not losing the intensity, and staying respectful to the if you're in this role, you're accountable on a quarterly basis, staying respectful to that, not losing intensity, but at the same time, not getting lost in it, and being able to keep the long term view in place. And the big keeping on moving it directionally in the long term view without losing the intensity of the short 13-week cycle. I think that's the biggest thing.”

We got to keep on moving. Both maintaining the continuity as well as the driving the change has been the big focus.”

On any passion projects that he wanted to pursue this year, Gopinathan said: “Not much that I'd like to call out of that nature, but our industry keeps changing. So professionally, there is never any dearth of challenging things and challenges.”",457,0.4383446176846822

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCS

TCS reported revenue of USD7.08b in 3QFY23, up 2.2% QoQ in constant currency (CC) terms, 60bp above our estimates despite seasonal weakness. The company reported deal wins of USD7.8b (down 3.7% QoQ/up 2.6% YoY, book-to-bill ratio at 1.1x), in line with our expectations. EBIT improved 50bp QoQ to 24.5%, in line with our estimates, aided by favorable FX (+70bp), improved utilization and lower sub-con costs (+30bp), partly offset (-50bp) by third-party expenses and travel normalization. LTM attrition moderated by 20bp to 21.3%, while attrition declined 6% QoQ on the quarterly annualized basis. TCS expects the supply situation to further ease, resulting in a continued downward trajectory in attrition ahead. Overall, management commentary on demand environment indicate caution in the near term despite consistent growth in the deal pipeline, as North America and continental Europe see a near-term deal conversion slowdown on account of macroeconomic challenges. But, TCS reiterated its aspiration of double-digit growth in the medium to long term. We continue to see growth constrains over the next two quarters, although TCS should be relatively insulated on account of its strong deal backlog (LTM TCV at USD35.4b, 1.3x book to bill). While we expect demand to start normalizing by Q2FY24, reduced visibility remains a key risk on FY24 growth. We factor in a USD revenue CAGR of 10% over FY22-25E.

Outlook

We have largely maintained our FY23/FY24/FY25 EPS estimates. Over FY22- 25E, we expect a USD revenue CAGR of ~10% and an INR EPS CAGR of ~15%. Our TP of INR3,810 implies 28x FY24E EPS, with a 15% upside potential. We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on TCS

TCS delivered better than expected revenue growth in Q3, while margins came a tad below our expectations. Revenue grew 2.9% QoQ to USD7.1bn (2.2% CC) in a seasonally-soft quarter, driven by cloud, ERP and cyber security services as well as market-share gains through vendor consolidation. Continued traction in regional markets (~6% CC QoQ growth for a second quarter in a row; inherently more volatile) largely explains the revenue beat. Deal-closure activity (deal intake TCV of USD7.8bn; book-to-bill at 1.1x) exhibited some moderation due to slower decision-making, although the deal pipeline build-up has remained healthy so far. Management remains watchful in the near term, considering heightened macro uncertainties; however, it reiterated confidence on accelerating revenue growth, once uncertainties abate. We tweak our earnings estimates for FY23-25 (<1% cut) post the Q3 performance and special dividend outgo.

Outlook

TCS is well placed to navigate the challenging demand environment, considering its well-diversified offerings across growth & transformation and cost takeout & efficiency projects; but this seems to be largely captured in the valuation, in our view. We retain HOLD with TP of Rs3,200/share at 22x Dec-24E EPS.

Rajesh Gopinathan, the chief of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) presented what was his 40th earnings as a top executive of India’s largest IT firm on January 9, 2022.

While TCS’ revenues came ahead of expectations, its cautious commentary, lower deal wins and decline in headcount made investors nervous, with its shares falling 2.34 percent on January 10. On cue, shares of its rivals such as Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro, which are set to report earnings this week, were in the red.

In an interview with Moneycontrol, Gopinathan reflected on his years as CFO and CEO presenting earnings, stating that the one thing that is very predictable is the intensity of each quarter.

“I keep joking, between a disaster quarter and a great quarter, the level of tolerance is 50 basis points. It is amazing how much we track on an annual basis. But overall, it has been a good ride I think,” he said.

Talking about the predictability in TCS earnings, he said, “No surprises is the best outcome of it. Most of what we say, and both our performance, our commentary, our philosophy, all of it is now well understood by the market. And there aren’t too many surprises, if anything, that boredom is our bigger risk, rather than any major surprise.”

TCS’ earnings for the third quarter ended December were broadly in-line, with constant currency revenue growth of 2.2% quarter on quarter and EBIT margins of 24.5%.

TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan offered some advice to fresh graduates in the country about the current job market -- it's important to choose a field and stay put for some time.

Gopinathan was in conversation with Moneycontrol when he was asked what his advice would be to a 19-year-old or a 20-year-old who's graduating this year in such a job market.

""Nineteen-year-olds typically know better, so they will do whatever they have to do. But it is important to choose some area and stay with it for a period of time, and not declare yourself an expert too fast and move on. So rather than flit from one to the other,"" he said.

""Because it's only with time that you understand the nuances better. The first flush is the context, because the first flush is easy to learn, but that's, that's, you know, 10 per cent of the game.""

Responding to another question on how TCS has managed to retain more than 1 lakh employees for 10 years, Rajesh Gopinathan said that they back promising employees, and always look inside every time a new opportunity pops up instead of looking for fresh talent outside the organisation.

Read more: TCS has over 1.25 lakh mid, senior level employees serving it for over 10 years

""So one of the reasons we're able to do that is, whenever something new comes, the first right of leadership in anything new goes to somebody inside,"" he said.

""So if you want to get into ChatGPT, we're not going to go and into the market saying that among the various people who are, who can we hire? Who knows something incremental on it. We look internally and say, who's likely to be the most knowledgeable or who can learn fast, back them up, give them the resources, learn and ask them now tell us what can we do with it, and then try to move the organisation that way.

Gopinath added that when employees see that they are being presented with better opportunities inside the organisation, there are more chances of them continuing to work for the company.

""As long as you keep on giving that opportunity of new things to internal people, you will retain talent. And the more you retain talent, the more you keep the context inside. And that gives you the competitive space, which gives you the space to get more growth opportunities.""

“They have been central to our ability to culturally and operationally integrate all the fresh talent we brought on board and ensuring that the project work outcomes and customer experiences continue to be the best in class,” Lakkad told analysts following the company announcing its results for Q3Fy23.

The company, which reported a reduction of 2,197 employees during the third quarter of FY23 sequentially, said on January 9 that its workforce as of December 2022 was 6,13,974. The company’s net addition has been declining each quarter in FY23.

Speaking to analysts, Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan said the company’s incremental hiring must be seen in the context of the capacity they have built up so far.

“We have significantly invested in building up capacity in 2021, tried as much as possible to bypass the industry's hire-from-each-other attrition cycle and focused on hiring at entry level and invested in training and cross-training our resources. That investment has hit our productive capacity and stood us in the stead. So, the incremental hiring that we saw this year should be seen in the context of what we've done in the last year also. And overall, we are very comfortable with where we are with our net headcount,” he said.

He added that there should be a more normal hiring trend, and they expect gross hiring in the range of 1.25-1.5 lakh for the year. Along with an expected normalisation of attrition levels, Gopinathan said they will have sufficient capacity to take care of growth. “Then we can keep bringing in shorter-term hiring to take care of demand as it unfolds,” he said.

Lakkad said that net hiring last year was “significantly ahead” of revenue growth. The focus this year is to utilise that excess capacity and make the new hires productive, he said.

Attrition also saw a slight decline from the previous quarter to 21.3 percent from 21.5 percent on a last-twelve-month basis.

“LTM attrition in IT Services was at 21.3 percent, slightly down quarter-on-quarter, but still very elevated as it reflects the high levels of churn in the prior quarters. Our quarterly annualised attrition on the other hand, fest by nearly 6 percent in Q3, as we expect it to steadily trend down over the coming quarters,” Lakkad said.",412,-0.24687271118164061

Tata Consultancy Services, which reported its numbers for Q3FY23 on January 9, saw its Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan remaining upbeat even amid a challenging demand scenario for the sector. This was particularly in the US and UK markets, from where the company derives a majority of its revenue from. However, he was cautious about the situation in Europe.

The total contract value (TCV) for the third quarter of FY23 for TCS was $7.8 billion. This was in line with management's guidance of a TCV run rate of $7-9 billion per quarter. Last quarter's order book was $8.1 billion, as compared to $7.6 billion at the same time last year.

“We are pleased with our strong growth in a seasonally weak quarter, driven by cloud services, market share gains through vendor consolidation, and continued momentum in North America and UK,” Gopinathan said in a statement.

He added that in the customer base they focus on, they have seen vendor consolidation where clients are preferring large vendors like TCS, and here the company has market share gains when it comes to the spend at a customer-level, he said.

On the nature of the demand, Gopinathan said he expects this year to be a more balanced year. “A lot more balanced in terms of cost optimization, cost-based transformation deals, and that varies by market,” he said.

Speaking on the types of deals he is bullish on, N Ganapathy Subramaniam, COO, TCS said, “Tech spending is holding up specifically in terms of large deals related to cloud transformation. We are seeing some weaknesses in mortgages and insurance. Consequently, banks might be planning some exposure reduction to these offerings. Capital markets/ trading side of it is looking good. In wealth and retirement space, people are looking at technology to bring in automation.”

Gopinathan added that a lot of work is also happening on cloud because a lot of investments have gone into it.

“From actual project work related to cloud, there's quite a lot of work yet to be done. We are very strongly participating in that. You can consider whether to call it digital transformation or not. But it is truly transformative. And that will continue through the year well into the year,” he said.

During the third quarter, Rail Delivery Group, TAP Air Portugal, Al Maryah Community Bank, and CTBC Bank, headquartered in Taiwan, were among the most significant deals won. TCS is yet to officially announce a possible deal with BSNL worth over $2 billion.

TCS' growth in major markets was led by North America and the UK, which increased 15.4 percent year-on-year in constant currency, followed by Continental Europe (9.7 percent). In emerging markets, India grew 9.1 percent, Latin America grew 14.6 percent, the Middle East and Africa grew 8.6 percent, and the Asia Pacific grew 9.5 percent.

Sector-wise, Retail and CPG (18.7 percent) led the growth followed by Life Sciences & Healthcare verticals (+14.4 percent). Communications & Media grew +13.5 percent and Technology & Services grew +13.6 percent. Manufacturing grew +12.5 percent while BFSI grew +11.1 percent.

Some of TCS' key sectors, including retail and BFSI, are currently facing a challenging business environment in core markets like the US due to inflation, rising interest rates, a hit to the banking sector's mortgage loan sub-segment, resulting in consumers losing purchasing power, and several other ongoing macro uncertainties, particularly in the top two markets, the US and Europe.

According to leading IT analyst Moshe Katri of Wedbush Securities, TCS’ clients are approaching CY23 IT budgets cautiously though they are yet to see any indications of upcoming budget cycle delays or elongated sale cycles.

TCS has been expanding its existing customer base in terms of wallet share. Katri in his report highlighted that the IT major remains focussed on expanding wallet share from existing clients through its restructured business operations by “aligning customer size/maturity with delivery, with the intention of building confidence while creating cross-selling transformational initiatives; TCS’ business transformation group manages large/mature clients.”",945,0.7624971680343151

A contraction in the net addition number was seen previously in the first quarter of FY21, which was when India was in a complete lockdown due to the first wave of the pandemic.

The company, which announced its results for Q3FY23 on January 9, said its headcount is currently at 6,13,974, down from 6,16,171. This is the first time the net addition has declined in 10 quarters. TCS added 9,840 employees during Q2FY23, which was also a significant dip.

Milind Lakkad, the company’s Chief Human Resources Officer, however said that the hiring slowdown is not a blip, and that it was 'planned that way'.

TCS had added 28,238 employees during the same quarter last year.

Addressing the press, Lakkad said that they have made investments in fresh talent as well as in talent development to make them productive.

""That investment coupled with tightening, all of that resulted in a negative headcount. That does not indicate anything on the demand side. Demand is high, we are just operating very efficiently right now,"" he said.

Elevated attrition, which has been a point of concern across the industry, saw a slight decline. Attrition in Q3FY23 stood at 21.3 percent, a slight decline from 21.5 percent in Q2FY23 on a last-twelve-month basis. TCS said that this attrition is expected to fall further in the coming quarters.

In Q3FY22, TCS’ attrition was 11.9 percent.

It onboarded around 7,000 freshers during the quarter, with a total of 42,000 freshers being added during the fiscal so far. TCS had announced that it onboarded 35,000 freshers in H1FY23, of which 20,000 had been in Q2FY23. TCS hired over 1 lakh freshers in FY22, with a target of 40,000 for FY23.

“Our focus over the last few quarters on bringing in fresh talent at scale, training them on new technologies and making them productive is paying off. We are particularly proud of having 125,000 TCSers at middle and senior levels who have been with the company for more than 10 years on average. They have been central to the successful cultural integration of all the fresh talent we have onboarded in the last couple of years, and their contextual knowledge and customer-centricity have been key to the high level of customer satisfaction that TCS is known for,” said Lakkad in a statement.

For the quarter, Nirmal Bang’s Head of Research Girish Pai said the hiring slowdown was expected to continue, and that the number “will also serve as a harbinger of any growth slowdown, although the company has been saying otherwise.”

The focus this quarter will be on the impact of furloughs across the industry, which was higher than expected.

“The focus on furloughs will be high. The furlough impact was minimal in the last two years due to aggressive client spending and large deal ramp-up. We expect high furloughs in hi-tech and moderate in others,” a note by Kotak Institutional Equities said.",512,-0.32798688610394794

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on January 9 reported a 10.98 percent increase in its consolidated net profit at Rs 10,883 crore for the quarter ended December 2022 (Q3FY23). The company had posted a profit of Rs 9,806 crore in the year-ago period.

The consolidated revenue from operations came in at Rs 58,229 crore, up 19.11 percent against Rs 48,885 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.

The revenue beat expectations but the profit was below expectations.

In constant currency terms, the revenue rose 13.5 percent year-on-year (YoY), the company said, adding that growth was led by North America & UK, which rose 15.4 percent YoY. Operating margin stood at 24.5 percent - contracting by 0.5 percent YoY. Net margin came in at 18.6 percent.

In a seasonally-weak quarter, analysts had estimated the Tata group company to report 2.9 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth in revenue, while net profit was projected to increase 7.8 percent QoQ in the October-December quarter.

The company also announced a dividend of Rs 75 per share including Rs 67 as a special dividend. The record date for dividends is January 17 and the payment date is February 3, 2023.

Order book for the quarter stood at $7.8 billion.

“We are pleased with our strong growth in a seasonally weak quarter, driven by cloud services, market share gains through vendor consolidation, and continued momentum in North America and the UK,"" said Rajesh Gopinathan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, TCS. ""The sustained strength of demand for our services is a validation of the value we provide to our clients in helping them differentiate themselves while enhancing their competitiveness. Looking ahead, and beyond current uncertainties, our longer-term growth outlook remains robust.”

TCS' net headcount went down by 2,197 employees, the company said. Its last twelve-month IT Services attrition rate was at 21.3 percent.

“Improved productivity, currency support and abating supply side challenges helped expand our operating margin in Q3,"" said Samir Seksaria, Chief Financial Officer, TCS. ""This gives us greater confidence in our ability to steer our profitability towards our preferred range while continuing to invest in building newer capabilities to support our growth and market share gains.”

Commenting on the quarterly performance of the IT bellwether, Sanjeev Hota, Head of Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas noted, ""Management commentary on demand environment looks hazy for short to medium term owing to uncertain global environment. Management sounded more confident on demand recovery in North Americas and UK in the coming quarters, though Europe outlook remain uncertain.""

""At the current juncture, owing to multiple global headwinds outlook for FY24E looks uncertain, but recovery could be gradual in the coming quarters. Structural growth story for Indian IT sector remains intact, and TCS being the flagbearer would emerge stronger.

2023-01-09 08:21:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-q3-earnings-five-things-to-watch-out-for-9831011.html,"The IT sector earnings season for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 is set to begin today, starting with IT services major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). This will be followed by Infosys and HCLTech on January 12 and Wipro on January 13 – all in the same week.

While the overall growth in the sector is expected to be muted in Q3 due to the holiday season, high furloughs and macroeconomic challenges creating select pockets of volatility in client segments like BFSI, high tech and telecom etc.; TCS will likely be able to report a decent performance as compared to its peers, according to industry analysts. However, its exposure to weaker markets like the Europe and the UK is the highest among peers.

Commenting on the current quarter’s demand outlook, TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan had said during Q2 earnings, “While the strength of our order book as well as the pipeline for Q3 is somewhat comforting, given the volatility, we remain very vigilant and are staying very close to our clients.”

Revenue Growth

Mega deals have already started to slow down and so has the nature of deal wins as clients are rethinking technology budgets amidst war, inflation, adverse regulatory changes and recessionary pressures in markets like the US, which account for nearly 60-65% of the revenue for the Indian IT services companies and Europe for another 20-25%, according to a recent ICRA report. Analysts are estimating TCS’ revenue for Q3 in constant currency (CC) terms to come in at around 1.5-1.9% touching $6,980 million or Rs. 56,922 crore.

TCS as compared to its peers has the highest exposure to the Europe and UK markets (currently the weakest against the US) at around 30% of its revenue, which might make it more vulnerable to the existing macro uncertainties.

Leading IT analyst Moshe Katri of Wedbush Securities, in his recent note said that TCS’ clients will remain cautious about CY23 IT budgets though there are no “indications of upcoming budget delays or elongated sale cycles.” Similar to September quarter, demand continues to exceed expectations, Katri said.

Demand may be in line with estimates

TCS’ management over the past couple of quarters remained bullish on maintaining deal win total contract value (TCV) in the range of $7-9 billion each quarter. In Q3 too, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities believe it could cross $9 billion plus even in TCV. Nirmal Bang’s head of research Girish Pai, however, expect that with no large deal win in Q3, the TCV could remain flattish on the account of “delays seen in decision making, especially on longer term deals.”

Wedbush Securities’ Katri said that TCS continues to remain focussed on expanding wallet share from existing clients by “aligning customer size/maturity with delivery, with the intention of building confidence while creating cross-selling transformational initiatives; TCS’ business transformational group manages large/mature clients.”

Vendor consolidation

With large and mega deals slowing down as well as multi-year transformation deals which were earlier being broken down among several service providers taking a back seat, vendor consolidation is the latest is trend that has emerged and likely to benefit Tier-I IT companies like TCS. These deals though will be comparatively of lower sizes as compared to the overall mega digital transformation deals, analysts told Moneycontrol.

“Vendor consolidation could become the theme for the coming quarters and would be a lever of growth for the company,” Pai said in his report.

Hence, the nature of deal wins, deal sizes and the sectors will be something to watch out for.

Impact of furloughs

Commentary on higher than expected furloughs will be a major theme to keep a track on; combined with slowdown in demand and decision making from certain sectors like mortgage, hi-tech, telecom, retail and manufacturing.

This will also reflect in the revenue growth numbers. “In CC terms, the revenue growth is likely to be at ~1.6% QoQ, implying ~20bp of currency headwinds. 3Q furloughs are expected to be higher than the earlier trend,” analysts at Motilal Oswal noted.

“The focus on furloughs will be high. The furlough impact was minimal in the last two years due to aggressive client spending and large deal rampup. We expect high furloughs in hi-tech and moderate in others,” said analysts at Kotak Institutional Securities.

Consequently, attrition rate is expected to start receding. Last quarter, TCS management said that attrition had likely started to bottom out and the company will now focus on improving utilisation rate. In fact, in Q2 employee addition stood at 9,840, its lowest net new addition in the last nine quarters.

Rupee depreciation to reap benefits

Overall EBIT margins or operating margins is expected to improve/ expand further by around 60-100 bps, according to analysts. According to Kotak’s analysts, this will be driven by depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar and other currencies, easing supplyside pressures, especially in India and general operational improvements.

Last quarter, TCS management had shared a guidance of 25% operating margin by Q4 exit. Any commentary on margins and changing trends will be important.

All eyes will be on IT bellwether Tata Consultancy Services’ (TCS) Q3 results today. In a seasonally-weak quarter, the Tata-group company is expected to report 2.9 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth in revenue, while net profit is expected to increase 7.8 percent QoQ in the October-December quarter.

According to a poll of brokerages, consolidated revenue might come in at Rs 56,992 crore, registering 16.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth, while consolidated profit after tax (PAT) is expected to increase 15.1 percent YoY to Rs 11,247 crore.

​In constant currency terms, analysts are forecasting a revenue growth of 1.9 percent on a quarterly basis. This is significantly lower than the 4 percent growth registered in Q2 largely because Q3 is generally considered a weak quarter for IT companies.

In the October-December quarter, billable (working) days are fewer during the holiday season and furloughs are higher.

“Over the past two years, aggressive client spending in technology and large deal ramp-ups helped in overcoming the seasonal weakness of Q3,” noted foreign brokerage firm Nomura. This time, industry seasonality is set to return with pain further accentuated by macro concerns of slowdown in the US and Europe.

Investec Securities in its report notes that the management of TCS had earlier indicated headwinds in property and casualty (P&C) insurance, mortgage, discretionary retailers in Europe and the UK, and potentially higher furloughs.

Margins, however, are set to expand on a sequential basis by 80 basis points. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The increase in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin will be led by depreciation of the rupee against the USD and general operational improvements, noted analysts.

“Supply-side pressures are also abating with compensation expectations moderating and attrition coming off. This, too, will help in margin improvement on QoQ basis,” said Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities. EBIT margin is expected at 24.80 percent.

Deal wins and things to watch out for

Management commentary on deal wins will be keenly monitored to get a sense of any slowdown in client spends. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities expect total contract value (TCV) of $9 bn+ for the quarter, stating that the company has been active in a number of deal announcements. BT Group and UK Government’s rail data marketplace were some of the significant deal-wins of the past quarter.

Other important factors to watch out for will be: commentary on rate of spending increase / decline and priorities of clients; impacted geographies and verticals especially hi-tech and retail; and attrition rate and vendor consolidation opportunities.

The management has maintained that 26-28 percent margin band in the longer term is TCS' guiding beacon. Thus, the Street will be eyeing commentary on growth levers to achieve that band.

Analysts expect growth to be impacted by seasonal factors as well as macro indicators.

The third quarter is a seasonally weak quarter for IT companies due to fewer working days as well as furloughs. This time, it’ll be further impacted by the deteriorating macro.

1. Revenue growth

Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said they expect muted revenue growth of 0-3 percent, and revenue growth will moderate to high single-digits to low teens on a year-on-year (YoY) basis.

The moderation, they said, will be due to the slowdown in segments like mortgages, hi-tech, and retail and telecom. It said that furloughs have been higher than usual, particularly in the hi-tech segment, after escaping their impact over the last two years.

Emkay Global, in a note, said that revenue growth is expected to moderate “on account of furloughs, lower number of working days, deferred spending by a few clients, and increased cautiousness among clients amid macro uncertainties and high inflationary environment.”

Emkay expects CC revenue growth of 0.8-3.7 percent for tier-1 companies, and -0.4 to 3.4 percent for mid-cap companies.

“We expect the usual seasonality in H2 growth to be amplified by slower decision making and weak discretionary spending due to macro uncertainties,” it said.

2. Furloughs

“..We expect revenue growth to reset from mid-teens to mid to high single digits from tight tech budgets and pricing pressure after higher-than-expected furloughs in Dec 2022,” analysts at JP Morgan said in a note.

Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities said that weakness is expected to be accentuated by company-specific disappointments due to higher furloughs, primarily in the BFSI and hi-tech sectors.

According to JP Morgan, commentaries from companies suggest that furloughs in Q3FY23 will also drag into Q4 due to clients being cautious, which implies a destruction in demand.

3. Margins

Emkay Global said margins are expected to expand 20-100 bps, sequentially, for tier-1 companies, and 20-50 bps for tier-2 companies.

“While margins will improve on a QoQ basis for the entire coverage universe, we think they will disappoint vis-à-vis prior expectations…. There will be pressure from weaker-than-expected revenue growth, lower utilisation QoQ, tail-end of wage pressures, higher travel and higher sales and marketing spends,” a note by Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities read.

“Thus, while we expect QoQ CC revenue growth for players under our coverage at 1-3.5 percent and QoQ margin improvement, the investor focus is more on FY24. The Q4FY23 commentary will be keenly evaluated to see how the new year starts off,” the note added.

However, Motilal Oswal said that the weakening macros and recessionary fear has had “had lesser adverse impact on the overall demand environment than it was anticipated at the beginning of the quarter.”

It expects some margin improvement in Q3. “Though improved utilisation, billable freshers and favorable FX (for some companies) are likely to provide some margin tailwinds, the same will be partly offset by the adverse impact from furloughs and higher proportion of cost take-out deals,” it said.

4. IT Spends

For the full calendar year, Kotak expects moderation in IT spending, and that IT services managements may not have full visibility. It expects TCS and HCL Tech to report a relatively better quarter, while Tech Mahindra and Mphasis are expected to lag.

According to ICRA, Indian IT services are susceptible to macroeconomic uncertainties and adverse regulatory changes in key operating markets it operates in as it generates 60-65 percent revenues from the US market and 20-25 percent from the European market.

“Growth in the BFSI segment, one of the key segments for IT companies, has tapered more than other segments in recent quarters, and this is partially attributable to lower lending activity. Moreover, if the macroeconomic headwinds persist, mortgage lending and the retail segments are expected to witness relatively higher moderation in growth, compared to the manufacturing and healthcare segments. While the current healthy order book position from clients will support a healthy growth over the near term, the evolving macroeconomic situation is likely to result in lower order inflows, going forward,” said Deepak Jotwani, Assistant Vice President & Sector Head, ICRA.

BNP Paribas, on the other hand, said that while the macro backdrop is uncertain, lateral data suggests IT spending will be resilient and that medium-to-long-term growth drivers are intact.

5. Guidance

Kotak Institutional Equities said it expects Infosys to retain its guidance of 15-16 percent CC revenue growth and 21-22 percent as EBIT margin for FY23. HCL Tech is also expected to retain its guidance of 13.5-14.5 percent revenue growth and 18-19 percent revenue guidance. For Q4FY23, it expects Wipro to guide 1-3 percent revenue growth.",782,-0.24392335613568625

Muted, weak and soft. These are some of the words that analysts are throwing up to project earnings for IT service providers for the quarter ended December 2022. The trend highlights the start of perhaps a long winter for them.

IT companies, which generate most of their revenues from export of services, are likely to be impacted due to recessionary pressure in the US – their biggest market – and other western nations.

“We see potential for negative surprises across the board on revenue led by higher furloughs and pressure on the existing book of business,” said Nitin Padmanabhan, an analyst at Investec Securities.

Earnings commentary from Accenture last month was foreboding. IT companies have also reduced their expectations themselves. However, there are some hopes that top names may maintain their growth guidance.

Revenue stagnation

IT companies have just come through their golden period as the increased tech adoption during pandemic led to a rapid revenue growth. Though things are not looking up from here, they are also not looking down.

“We expect muted revenue growth of 0-3 percent (quarter on quarter) for our coverage universe,” said Kawaljeet Saluja, an analyst at Kotak Institutional Equities. “Revenue growth will moderate to high-single digits to low-teens on YoY comparison.”

Also read: Accenture second-quarter forecast disappoints as IT spending weakens

Saluja said the EBIT margin of IT firms that was contracting for a few quarters now will likely improve, albeit moderately. TCS and HCL Tech should report relatively better quarter, while Tech Mahindra and Mphasis should lag, he added.

Dipesh Mehta of Emkay Global echoed the observation. “We expect the revenue growth momentum to moderate in Q3 on account of furloughs, lower number of working days, deferred spending by few clients, and increased cautiousness among clients amid macro uncertainties and high inflationary environment,” he said.

Mehta expects constant currency revenue growth of 0.8 percent to 3.7 percent for Tier-I companies with cross-currency impact of 20-50 bps on reported USD revenue and of negative 0.4 percent to positive 3.4 percent for mid-cap firms with cross-currency impact of 10-30 bps on reported USD revenue.

Investors should note that the flat revenue growth is coming at a high base. Meaning, they will still be growing, although at a slower pace.

Deal wins: Unexciting?

Deal wins, which reached record highs earlier last year, could be in line with historical trends in most cases, said Padmanabhan, but highlighted that these are deals that have been in the making since Q1FY23. From Q4FY23, lower deal flow could be seen as clients trim their spending.

Kotak also said it expects steady but unexciting deal win numbers from IT companies. Many companies have announced a few interesting deals in the three months, with TCS leading the pack.

“We believe TCS could report TCV (total contract value) of $9-10 billion. We expect $2.5 billion of TCV from Infosys and HCL Tech,” said Saluja. “TCV growth for the sector moderated in the last four quarters though that failed to impact growth since many deals were discretionary shortcycle programs.”

Stock talks

The market has already reflected some of the lower projections on earnings. However, low-level buying in some names has kept it afloat so far. In the last one year, the Nifty IT index has delivered merely 2 percent returns.

Among the biggest names, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has seen a drawdown of 15 percent in the last year. In the same period, Infosys is down 21 percent, HCL Tech 22 percent and Wipro 46 percent.

“The risk for IT services stocks is continued revenue weakness in H2FY23 followed by a tepid start to FY24,” said Padmanabhan. “This could bring down Tier-I growth expectations to 6-7 percent vs 8 percent currently, leading to a potential contraction in P/E multiples.”

The selloff in some names have made them attractive. However, all investors are not rushing to buy as they wait and watch the development.

“We expect investors to focus on growth/decline in IT budgets for CY2023, the state of demand, and the pace of decision making. Infosys, HCL Tech and Mphasis are our top picks,” said Saluja.

Emkay said its pecking order is Wipro, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech, and TCS among Tier-I players, and Zomato, Mphasis, Birlasoft, Firstsource Solutions and Persistent Systems among mid-caps.

Key monitarables:

- CY23 IT budget

- FY23 revenue growth/margin guidance

- Deferment or cancellation of projects due to macro uncertainties, high inflation, and supply-chain disruptions

- Management commentary on the changing nature of deals (cost takeouts vs. business transformation) and potential impact on tech spending from high inflation and economic slowdown

- Demand trends in key verticals such as BFSI, retail, manufacturing, and communications

- Segments exhibiting weak demand trends;

- Deal intake/pipeline

- Pricing environment

- Attrition.

If the war on talent in IT dominated headlines in 2021, the winds began to shift in the opposite direction near the end of the previous fiscal year, with companies adding fewer employees with each passing quarter. The pain was more visible in the September quarter, when IT company employee additions fell 45 percent sequentially.

In the 2022 calendar year — or three quarters (figures for the December quarter will be available in January) — three out of four of the top IT firms have shown a declining trend in net employee additions.

Tata Consultancy Services, India's largest software exporter, added 35,209 employees on a net basis in the March quarter, the company's highest-ever net addition in a quarter. This dropped by nearly 60% in the June quarter, when it added 14,136 new employees. This number fell to 9,840 in the September quarter, bringing the total for the calendar year to 59,185.

The company's highest-ever net addition at the start of the year doesn't mean attrition isn't a concern. While attrition is lower than that of competitors, it has continued to rise. It was 17.4 percent in the March quarter, followed by 19.7 percent and 21.5 percent in the following quarters.

Attrition was not the only factor. IT companies' margins have also been squeezed, with wage bills accounting for a sizable portion of expenses and employee costs rising.

Following the company's results in Q2FY23, TCS Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan stated that it was not a short-term margin lever, but rather a strategic call to expand employee onboarding.

“We had hired close to 120,000 freshers last year and invested into that pool given the longer-term visibility that we have on demand. We will tweak our employee model on an ongoing basis looking at the demand. So, that is a reasonable expectation, but our overall hiring model is predicated on much longer cycles rather than on short-term, quarter-on-quarter adjustments,” he said.

Its competitor Infosys added 21,948 employees in the March quarter and 21,171 in the June quarter. However, in the September quarter, this was cut in half to 10,032 people, bringing the net addition for the year so far to 53,151. Attrition at Infosys is also high, but it started to decline in Q2FY22, falling from 28.4 percent to 27.1 percent sequentially.

Infosys’ cross-town rival Wipro added 11,457 employees in the first quarter of the calendar year, increasing to 15,446 in the June quarter, but this fell sharply to 605 in the September quarter, bringing the company's net addition for the year to 27,508. Attrition has started to dip and was at 23 percent in Q2FY23.

However, the pain is apparent for Wipro, which has delayed the onboarding of newly hired employees. While the company has stated that it will honour all offers made.

HCLTech defied the trend with a net employee addition of 11,000 in the March quarter, which fell sharply to 2,089 the following quarter and rose to 8,359 in the September quarter, bringing its total net addition over the three quarters of the 2022 calendar year to 21,448. Attrition for the last two quarters has remained at 23.8 percent.

As the talent market has begun to cool, companies are also looking at having a bottom-heavy pyramid and utilising the talent they've already hired. While the War on Talent was on, inflated salaries added to woes of companies, as they hired and replaced talent at a premium.

According to ICRA, wage cost inflation will likely begin to moderate by the end of the current fiscal year, but ""margins will susceptible to any moderation in business performance due to macroeconomic headwinds.""

As net additions have declined, so have IT job openings.

Data from specialist staffing firm Xpheno in November revealed that IT job openings were on the decline for 7 months before seeing some uptick. Available jobs fell by more than 50 percent year on year in October. Although the number of available jobs increased in November, it remained the second lowest in a 24-month period.

According to Xpheno data, jobs in the IT sector used to account for more than 80 percent of available job openings, but that figure is now less than 50 percent.

“While global big tech players and their counterparts continue to rock the boat with layoffs and hiring freeze, Indian IT majors and cohorts aren’t entirely following suit. The marginal recovery and return of hiring action among the Indian Tech cohorts is a sign of returning to moderated pre-Covid levels of action. There could well be a window of opportunity opening up for the? Indian IT Service sector, when global marquees under margin pressures, rework their plans to offshore jobs,” Xpheno co-founder Anil Ethanur said.

According to data from job platform foundit released earlier this month, there has been a revival in IT after months of decline, indicating a positive sentiment in hiring.",836,-0.5526530061449323

As per a note from ISG, there were three mega awards with a total ACV of $705 million in Q3CY22. This is the lowest number of mega awards in the sector since 2017. Rather, the most significant year-to-date growth in the sector has been driven by an increase in the number of smaller transactions ranging from $5 to $19 million in ACV. Meanwhile, mega deals continue to remain flat.

This comes at a time when the Indian IT sector has started to experience a slowdown in growth due to macroeconomic uncertainty, inflation, and a looming recession in the US, all of which are influencing client spending in the sector.

However, from January to September, there were 18 mega deals reported, with an ACV totalling $2.7 billion. This contrasts with 13 awards totalling $2.5 billion in ACV during the same period last year.

“As we discussed last year, enterprises are favouring smaller, shorter engagements. There are a lot of reasons for this: companies need to realize the results of outsourcing faster, and they need to reduce transformation risk,” the note said.

It added, “Companies also are increasingly carving out and rebidding less successful components of larger transactions. And, given the explosive growth of cloud, there are fewer technology assets – like servers and software licenses – included in awards than in the past.”

Ashutosh Sharma, head of research at Forrester Research India said, “We too are observing a similar trend in terms of deal wins. The biggest concern is the economic uncertainty that is plaguing Europe and North America. Over the last few days we have seen that situation resolve a little bit, but during Q3 and most parts of Q4 we had the same issue as the companies weren’t certain of where exactly the economy is headed. Consequently, they were avoiding discretionary spends while delaying some of the deals to conserve cash.”

“I expect a similar trend to play out in the Q4CY22 quarter as well. It was only in the last couple of weeks that things have started to look up,” Sharma added.

“The technology cycle is unpredictable and with uncertainty, clients want to invest in areas that can visibly give better results. As we discussed in the past, earlier larger outsourcing contracts used to be part of a large infra-kind of deal involving lot of managed services around servers, storage, managing private data centers, etc. By adopting more SaaS, those requirements are going away,” explained Mrinal Rai, principal analyst at ISG.

ISG also mentioned that the deal sizes reflect changes in buyer behaviour more than in size of providers. Small deals will continue to grow while mega deals remain flat. Also, even though every service provider tries to persuade client companies towards consolidation and its benefits, the competition remains tough as there are hundreds of IT services providers competing for the same work.

“So consolidation, when it happens, does not really move the needle,” it said.

Growth hiccups

The cracks of an impending slowdown from the IT sector's hypergrowth of the last two years have recently started to reflect in company commentary. HCLTech and Accenture both reduced their revenue growth guidance in December.

During HCLTech's investor day earlier this month, CEO C Vijayakumar said that the company's revenue is likely to come in the lower ends of its guidance band of 13.5-14.5% in constant currency terms due to higher-than-expected furloughs and challenges in the BFSI and Hi-tech segments.

Accenture reported its Q1 performance (which follows the September-August fiscal year) last week and added that the next quarter's guidance will be in the range of $15.20 billion to $15.75 billion, which was slightly lower than analysts' estimates.

Accenture maintained that the impact of foreign exchange on results will be -5% for the fiscal year 2023 overall, compared to the previous estimate of -6%. Accenture's performance trend typically provides an indication of Indian IT companies' performance for the upcoming quarter, as the company employs a large number of Indians locally.",714,-0.6309380948543548

An employee cannot work against the interest of the industrial establishment where he is employed and thus cannot take up additional employment which will impact his employer, Rameswar Teli, Minister of State for Labour and Employment said on Monday addressing queries around moonlighting and recent layoffs during a Lok Sabha session.

“As per the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act 1946, a workman shall not at any time work against the interest of the industrial establishment in which he is employed and shall not take any employment in addition to his job in the establishment, which may adversely affect the interest of his employer,” Teli replied.

Moonlighting has been a cause of concern for the Indian IT sector over the past few months as companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, and HCLTech came forward to voice their displeasure and objection against moonlighting or the practice of employees holding a second job secretly while being employed with them. Wipro’s chairman Rishad Premji had said the company had in fact fired over 300 employees found moonlighting while Infosys drafted guidelines around it without mentioning the term moonlighting.

Meanwhile, in another episode, Indian start-ups have been laying off in big numbers, especially in sectors like edtech, SaaS, and e-commerce. Nearly 20,000 Indian start-up employees lost jobs over the past few months.

Teli said, “Matters relating to lay-off and retrenchment in industrial establishments are governed by the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (ID Act) which also regulates various aspects of lay-off and conditions precedent to retrenchment of workmen. As per the ID Act, establishments employing 100 persons or more are required to seek prior permission from the appropriate Government before effecting closure, retrenchment, or lay-off.

Further, any retrenchment and lay-off are deemed to be illegal and is not carried out as per the provisions of the ID Act. ID Act also provides for the right of workmen laid off and retrenched for compensation and it also contains provision for re-employment of retrenched workmen.”

“In the establishments that lie in the jurisdiction of Central Government, the Central Industrial Relations Machinery (CIRM) is entrusted with the task of maintaining good Industrial relations and protecting the interest of workers including on the matters relating to layoff and retrenchment and their prevention. The jurisdiction in the matters with regard to multi-national and Indian companies in the IT, social media, Edu Tech firms and related sectors lie with the respective State Governments,” he added.",410,-0.9999858140945435

Indian IT companies are in for a long winter as their global peer Accenture’s Q2 revenue guidance signals caution in demand outlook. Despite a good show in Q1 (Sept-Nov), the company’s revenue guidance stands in the range of $15.20 billion to $15.75 billion, which is slightly below analysts' estimates.

On a year-on-year basis, Accenture’s revenue from North America came in at $7.62 billion, up 10 percent. On the other hand, its revenue from Europe declined 0.5 percent YoY to $5.07 billion.

Its new bookings for the Sept-Nov period were at $16.2 billion, down 3 percent compared to last year. Despite good pricing in new deals, the management expects to see weaker margins in Q2 before any improvement in later part of the fiscal year.

According to foreign brokerage firm Nomura, Accenture’s FY23 guidance of 8-11 percent growth in constant currency terms indicates moderation in demand. Thus, it expects consensus’ FY24 revenue growth estimates for Indian IT companies to see downward revisions. Morgan Stanley also sees limited triggers for re-rating of Indian IT companies in the near term.

Meanwhile, Citi believes Infosys is the only ‘Buy’ in the sector and management comments on IT budgets remain a key point. “We remain cautious on IT stocks given the tough macro environment,” said Citi.

Accenture’s earnings come before those of India's major IT companies, and usually is an indicator of how Indian IT companies' results are expected to pan out. Share price of Indian IT companies like TCS, Infosys and Wipro opened lower on December 19 after Accenture’s earnings.

On the back of recession fears in the US and Europe coupled with high valuation versus long-term averages, Nifty IT index is down over 20 percent for the year.

Despite rising macroeconomic uncertainty in the United States and weaknesses in key sectors such as lending, high tech, and telecom, the IT sector remains resilient as the industry's cost-supply equation improves, said leading IT analyst Moshe Katri of Wedbush Securities in a note on December 11.

The development comes couple of days after HCLTech during its Investor Day in New York said that it expected revenue growth to come in at the lower end of its revenue guidance band of 13.5-14.5 percent in constant currency (CC) terms. The company is also seeing increased furloughs and pain in segments like Hi-tech and BFSI. HCLTech previously increased its revenue guidance for FY23 from 12-14 percent in CC terms during its Q2FY23 earnings.

Meanwhile, Indian analysts and Credit Suisse estimated that the top four Indian IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro and HCLTech are set to see a slump in growth and a 10-27 percent correction in their public market valuation.

In his note, Katri said, “In this context, we believe HCL Tech’s commentary/guidance revision (late last week) is a function of its exposure to a volatile products/software business as well as to weakening High Tech and Telecom verticals.”

“The general consensus was that despite the macro volatility, and select “pockets of weakness” (High Tech, Telecom, Lending), “the sky isn’t falling” (record deal pipelines, shifting to cost-rationalization), the industry’s cost (wage comp) and supply equation (lateral to junior hires) is improving, a macro-driven, budget cycle slippage is transitory and finally, forward (12-months) estimates are reasonable (“soft landing” scenario),” he added.

According to Wedbush Securities, despite pockets of weakness in multiple verticals, “including High tech (i.e., recent layoffs), Telecom and Equity Capital markets/lending. Banks (BFSI) are in strong financial position, which we view as an important positive.”

No signs of demand slowdown

According to Katri, there are no signs of a slowdown in demand based on his conversations with companies, experts, and insiders, and the worst-case scenario is a one-to-two-month delay in budget cycle decisions.

“While at this point, there are no indications of noticeable demand slowdown, the worst case scenario continues to be macro-driven 1-2 months slippages in CY23 budget cycle decisions, impacting “fresh” funding for new project starts for the March (2023) quarter, resulting in a back-end loaded CY23 year,” Katri said.

How companies fared?

Wedbush Securities gave Infosys a 'outperform' rating, noting, “We see multiple levers in the model: expanding offshore mix (especially for digital work), expanding headcount mix from entry-level employees, reducing subcontractor use (at 10% of revenues to the 7% target level), pricing (value-based, customized deal structure, skill-based, outcome-based), and expanding fixed price work (roughly at 50% of sales).”

Meanwhile, Wipro got an 'underperform' rating, with most of the discussion centred on the ongoing integration of its acquired global management and technology consultancy firm, CapCo, and other operational metrics.

In terms of demand trends, Wipro expects budget cycle “slippage” resulting in moderation in consulting business. High tech (5% of sales), retail and lending/mortgage processing remain the weaknesses, whole BFSI looks in “great shape.”

“In general, we believe 30% of the company’s legacy-based revenues is contracting, reflecting the impact of automation, Saas and Cloud,” Katri said.

TCS remained “non-rated”; the company’s clients are approaching CY23 IT budgets cautiously and but there are no “indications of upcoming budget delays or elongated sale cycles.” “Similar to the September quarter, demand trends have been exceeding expectations,” Katri said in the report.

According to the report, the company continues focusing on expanding wallet share from existing clients by: “aligning customer size/maturity with delivery, with the intention of building confidence while creating cross-selling transformational initiatives; TCS’ business transformational group manages large/mature clients.”",620,-0.017855509122212728
2022-12-13 10:50:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-faces-lawsuit-in-the-us-alleging-discriminatory-hiring-practices-violation-of-visa-norms-9691221.html,"India's largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services has been sued by one of its former employees, who alleged that the IT firm discriminates against non-South Asian and non-Indian applicants and employees.

The lawsuit claims that TCS has a systematic pattern of discriminating against non-South Asian and non-Indian applicants and employees ""with respect to hiring, staffing, benching, termination, and promotion decisions,"" and that this policy is implemented top-down at the company.

This is not the first time that the Indian software company has been slapped with such a lawsuit. A similar lawsuit was filed in 2015, which the company won in 2018. At the time, the jury determined that TCS did not have a ""pattern or practice"" of discriminating against non-South Asian workers.

Shawn Katz, the complainant, worked for the company for nine years before being let go. This case was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on December 7.

A class action lawsuit refers to people who have suffered the same or similar injury; however, Katz says the exact number of members of this proposed class action lawsuit is unknown and can be determined using TCS' records.

Katz claimed that despite meeting the qualifications for promotion for several years in a row, he was never promoted during his nine-year tenure at the company. He adds that he was recommended for promotion by both managers and client companies, but was moved to the bench and then fired. During his time on the bench, he claimed TCS failed to provide ""meaningful assistance.""

The lawsuit he filed alleges that while only 12-13 percent of the US Information Technology industry is South Asian, approximately 70 percent of TCS’ US workforce is South Asian and “is primarily composed of non-citizens from India who are in the U.S. on work visas.”

It goes on to claim that this is grossly disproportionate and is the result of the company's employment discrimination against people who are not South Asian or Indian.

“TCS’s discrimination is systemic and ongoing, and impacts non-South Asians and non-Indians across the company, as well as applicants, who are disfavored in TCS’s hiring, staffing, promotion, and termination/retention decisions,” the complaint reads.

Over half of TCS’ business comes from the Americas.

Discrimination in hiring

According to the lawsuit, when TCS receives a contract from a US client, it must quickly fill open positions or risk losing the project, and TCS fills open US positions with both existing employees and new applicants. Existing employees include both local hires from the United States and those on work visas.

Existing TCS employees, as well as external applicants, must apply for open positions in the United States. The lawsuit goes on to say that once their time on a project is up, they are moved to the bench and must look for new positions within the company. They, too, must go through an application and interview process, just like any other external candidate.

“During this period, the employee is encouraged to apply directly to open positions on TCS’s internal portal and to work with TCS’s staffing group, the Resource Management Group (“RMG”), to locate open positions. If the employee remains on the bench for a prolonged period and cannot find a new position, TCS terminates his or her employment,” the lawsuit reads.

A hiring decision cannot be based on a person's race or national origin under US law, but the complaint goes on to say that both TCS talent acquisition and the third-party vendors the company uses have been directed to attract Indian candidates. As a result, it hires a disproportionately high percentage of South Asians and Indians, according to the lawsuit, and non-Indian and non-South Asian candidates are frequently passed over for open positions and not hired as a result of this discriminatory practice.

H-1B and L-1 visas

Those who wish to work on visas must be sponsored by the company for H-1B or L-1 non-immigrant work visas. While the H-1B visa is used to hire highly qualified workers for speciality jobs, the L-1 visa is used for intracompany transfers of those in managerial positions or with specialised knowledge. Each year, H-1B visas are limited, whereas L-1 visas are not.

The lawsuit contends that because the majority of TCS's workforce is located in India, the H-1B visa petitions that companies submit must specify an actual job at a specific location that the visa worker will fill if granted a visa.

“Each year, TCS seeks to maximize the number of visas it receives from the federal government. It does so by submitting visa petitions for more positions than actually exist in the U.S., allowing it to create an inventory of “visa ready” workers in India available to fill positions in the U.S. when they materialize,” it alleges. It goes on to add that the visa petitions falsely indicate that specific positions exist when they do not.

It goes on to say that TCS falsifies employee roles listed on H-1B and L-1A (managerial roles) visa applications, uses this to maximise visa approvals, and uses these people to perform low-level and non-managerial work in the US. The company also prioritises the placement of individuals on visas in US jobs, the lawsuit added.

The lawsuit provides an example of a company-wide directive in which RMG was instructed to use visa-ready employees onsite in the United States and maximise the use of every visa.

It goes on to allege that, in order to maximise visa holders' time on the visa, TCS ""disproportionately awards"" these employees higher appraisal scores and promotes them more frequently than non-Indian and non-South Asian employees.

Due to this practice, the majority of senior management in the US is predominantly South Asian and Indian, and many non-South Asians and non-Indians are never promoted during their time at TCS, the lawsuit said.

It adds that these non-Indian employees are often on the bench longer, and they are disproportionately terminated whereas South Asian visa employees from India are quickly allocated to new roles when their project ends.

“This results in non-South Asians and non-Indians being hired at lower rates, but also being fired at disproportionately higher rates.”

Relief sought

The relief sought includes directing TCS to adopt a valid and non-discriminatory method for hiring, promotion, termination, and other employment decisions; not to retaliate against individuals who complain of racial discrimination, awarding damages as well as front and back pay, and more.

Summons have been issued to TCS in this matter.

TCS told Moneycontrol that as per policy it cannot comment on subjudice matters.

The previous lawsuit that the company won had been brought by three former employees who claimed that they were discriminated against by being given fewer job opportunities and were fired because of their races and nationalities. It had made similar claims that non-South Asian employees were disproportionately benched and let go. In its verdict from 2018, the jury determined that TCS did not have a ""pattern or practice"" of discriminating against non-South Asian workers.",1161,-0.344157596429189

After two years of pandemic-induced demand and multi-year digital transformation deals, Indian IT sector appears to be entering a growth slump phase due to the macro economic challenges, inflation and an impending recession in the US market, which accounts for majority of the Indian IT sales.

The cracks were first pointed out by HCLTech on December 8 during its investor day, when CEO C Vijayakumar indicated that the revenue is likely to come in the lower ends of its revenue guidance band of 13.5-14.5 percent in CC (constant currency) terms due to furloughs being greater than expected and challenges in the BFSI and Hi-tech segment. The company indicated slowdown in discretionary spending in the tech, telecom and other verticals. Post Q2FY23 earnings, the company had increase revenue guidance band to 13.5-14.5 percent for overall FY23 from previous 12-14 percent in CC terms.

HCLTech's stock price corrected by over 6.3 percent since the investor day meeting.

Brokerage firm Credit Suisse, meanwhile, has downgraded the overall Indian IT sector, expecting a correction of 10-27 percent in market valuation, wherein HCLTech will be the worst hit. This comes on the back of an expected higher risk to revenue in the financial year 2024 in case the US economic situation worsens. The US market roughly accounts for 45-60 percent of the Indian IT sector revenue.

According to Credit Suisse, HCLTech may be at a risk of seeing over 20 percent correction in stock market valuation. Infosys and Wipro stand to see up to 15 percent possible correction, TCS might have an 8 percent risk of valuation correction.

The brokerage firm, however, has an outperforming rating for Infosys, even as it continues to remain neutral for TCS and HCLTech, and gives an underperforming rating to Wipro.

Infosys is witnessing more deals coming in the cost optimisation and efficiency improvement side with longer tenure. That’s why valuation of these deals too are higher compared to normal short-term execution digital deals, according to a report by Nirmal Bang.

Seasonality in revenue growth will be in line with the pre-pandemic trends.

December quarter weaker than expected

“We do expect this to be an industry-wide problem and not an HCL Tech specific one. While there was no discussion on specific numbers by either Infosys or Cognizant, we get the sense that December 2022 and possibly March 2023 are likely going to be growth challenged quarters for the industry; may be a bit more than earlier anticipated,” Girish Pai, head of research, Nirmal Bang said in his report.

Pai noted that the HCL Tech management commentary highlighted another problem expected in FY24 – pricing. “It hinted that price increases are more selective now than they were 6-9 months back.”

As per analysts at Morgan Stanley, though HCLTech’s “near-term update on the macro impact on demand/revenue was negative, but commentary on margins was comforting.”

“Management sounded confident on delivering a good order book for Dec-2022 quarter. On the margins front it maintained its guidance of 18- 19 percent, with near-term aspiration of returning to the 19-20 percent range,” the analysts noted.

For the overall IT sector, experts maintained that it will be difficult to get visibility on 2023 spending as budgeting delays in client spending is expected.

“We also believe that instead of a typical budget flush (because of a spend-it-or-lose-it condition), there is likely under-spending of budgets that could affect Dec’22 quarter revenue. We are also not sure whether the IT industry will have great visibility about spending in 2023 as we expect budgeting to be delayed and/or short-term oriented (quarter by quarter), with the possibility of divergence between spending vs budget if economic conditions and P&L/balance sheet conditions deteriorate,” Pai said.",624,-0.5383384319452139

When Anders Andersen, a Danish executive, lost his watch at the busy Bengaluru airport, he had little hope of reuniting with it.

The watch, a gold Omega with a brown strap, held deep sentimental value for Andersen: it was a birthday gift from his late grandfather.

Andersen was in India for a work trip last month. He is an executive of insurance company Tryg, that has a partnership with India's Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).

On his flight back home, he realised his watch was missing.

""I was preparing myself for permanent departure of the watch, lost in an airport with more than 16m annual travelers,"" he wrote in a LinkedIn post last week. ""I could feel the loss creeping in under my skin.""

Andersen later wrote an e-mail to the Bangalore International Airport Ltd and Airports Authority of India, keeping TCS in the loop too.

He received prompt responses from the Bengaluru airport's lost and found department, engagement centre and TCS, promising help.

But he tried not to get his hopes up till he got a definitive answer.

It came soon enough. Bengaluru airport authorities reached out to tell him that the watch had been found.

A TCS staff member drove to the airport to the pick up the watch. Another employee returned to it to Anders during their trip to Denmark.

Anders said finding his watch was a ""tiny needle in a huge haystack"" situation but the cooperation of airport officials and TCS staff made it possible.

""I am overwhelmed by the professionalism, effectiveness and cooperation of Bengaluru Airport CISF and the Terminal Lost & Found team,"" he added. ""And I am grateful to Tata Group Consultancy Services team for their local assistance and commitment to reunite me with my watch.

""This is also such a great practical example of professionalism and process performance scaling with scope of operations.""

Anders said he took back and an ""incredible"" experience from India.

His LinkedIn followers added comments of appreciation for Indian authorities.

""It caught my attention because I have the exact same watch, also from my grandfather,"" a user named Mark Dowling wrote. ""I have not lost anything during my Indian travels, but I can confirm the warmth and care of people generally in that wonderful country.""

Another person, Vanduta Khurana, said. ""So glad you could get such a sentimental piece back. Kudos to Banglore (sic) Airport Team.""

State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) is expected to launch its 4G services from January, CNBC-Awaaz said on November 15.

India's biggest software services exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has bagged the tender for the construction of towers to enable the rollout of the service, it said.

The tender for the setting up of 4G towers was released in January and the Tata group company is likely to give its nod in two to three days, the report cited sources as saying.

The IT major got the tender worth Rs 28,000 crore for the setting up of nearly one lakh telephone towers, sources said. The towers are likely to be set up over the next two years.

Along with the setting up 4G sites, TCS will maintain the network for nine years.

The loss-making BSNL, which recently got a Rs 1.64-lakh-crore bailout package from the government, is likely to send the purchase order for the construction and setting up of the towers in the coming month.

IT services major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on November 10 announced that it plans to expand in Illinois by creating 1,200 new jobs by the end of 2024. This investment is accompanied by a commitment to accelerate its STEM outreach efforts in local schools to cover 25 percent more students and teachers.

TCS currently has more than 3,000 employees from Illinois, including 1,100 who were hired within the last five years. Naperville is home to one of the 30 TCS facilities in the US where the IT services firm help digitally transform and grow businesses that are cornerstones of the Illinois economy, such as United Airlines and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

Over the last five years, TCS hired 512 graduates of Illinois colleges and universities, and it is the second largest recruiter of IT services talent in the country.

Suresh Muthuswami, Chairman of North America, TCS said, “Over the last few years, businesses in Illinois and across the U.S. have grappled with disruption – from the pandemic and inflation to supply chain problems and skyrocketing demand for talent.”

He added, “Our expansion in Illinois is driven by companies that use these obstacles as an opportunity to transform themselves and capture growth. They are investing to overcome today’s challenges and become more resilient for tomorrow. TCS is attracting the brightest talent in cloud computing, AI, cybersecurity and other technologies to help them become future-ready enterprises.”

Governor JB Pritzker said, “TCS’ expansion is a testament to our first-rate education system and our extraordinarily talented workforce. With their STEM Education Initiatives, the next generation of Illinoisans will be prepared for the innovative jobs of the future—jobs that will transform our state into the premier tech hub in the nation. To our partners at TCS: thank you for your commitment to the State of Illinois. We couldn’t be happier to call you our neighbors.”",312,0.33577295144399005

Even as these companies remain bullish on the business outlook, analysts have said clarity on larger deal wins will only emerge after the first quarter of 2023.

According to data from CareEdge Research accessed by Moneycontrol, there was no net new QoQ client addition for the $100-million-plus revenue bracket across these four companies in the second quarter. In fact, the total QoQ client addition across revenue buckets decreased to 90 from 154 in Q2FY22.

The research firm called it “an implied higher base effect on account of a sudden post-pandemic ramp-up in Q2FY22"". However, on a sequential basis, client additions remained largely flat.

According to Phil Fersht, CEO and Chief Analyst, HFS Research, the days of the mega deal are pretty much over and have been for a while now.

“The only 'mega deals' we are seeing are consolidations of existing services under one primary service provider, where costs are lowered due to the economics of scale and the service provider is willing to take on more risk to beef up financial results. Most deals are in the $10-30 million range,” he told Moneycontrol.

The last two years were marked by a sudden surge in demand and digital transformation deals across sectors for IT services companies, some of which have now started to cool down.

“The last quarter was a big super cycle for renewals. We’ve also seen the tail end of the big digital transformation projects after Covid. We’ll see a new cycle come back from the 2020 contracts earlier in Q1 of 2023,” said Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst, Constellation Research.

“The mega deals are very rare, and even the large deals are reducing now. The reason for that I think is mentioned in the earnings calls of both TCS and Infosys. They are seeing — and we are also observing within clients — a kind of hesitancy and some delay in decision making. So, that’s the reason that these kinds of deals are rare and are increasingly on hold,” said Mrinal Rai, Principal Analyst at technology research firm ISG.

Mega deals reflect economic cycles

According to Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and CEO, Everest Group, mega deals trend with the economic cycle. In the last two years, there has been an overall decline in mega deals as the market was more focussed on digital transformation, which requires smaller deal structures.

“We have also been at the tail end of the modernisation cycle, which has moved the prime target area of mega deals (legacy stacks) and moved into the cloud. On top of this, the market is in a moment of hesitation, caught between the need for further digital transformation and the prospect of a deep recession. Hence firms are taking a wait-and-see point of view, which has frozen many of these potential deals,” he told Moneycontrol.

“Given that the gestation period of a mega deal is at least six months and normally 9-12 months, we can expect these types of deals to be back with momentum in the second quarter and building after that,” Samuel added.

ISG’s Rai added that mega deals are increasingly becoming obsolete as the needs of clients have evolved.

“When we say smaller deals, these are digital transformation deals and usually the older mega deals used to involve complete IT infrastructure, which is now very rare in the industry, I don’t see these kinds of deals happening anymore. Even in the $400 million bracket, there is a digital component in each and every deal,” said Rai.

He added that clients are cautious right now and trying to spend on areas that will give quick results because the cycle of technology also remains unpredictable.

Demand remains resilient

Across companies and research firms, the outlook around demand seems to have remained the same — cautious, delayed but steady, though it may vary from sector to sector depending on the impact of the macro headwinds.

“We’ve conducted a business confidence survey and we are seeing tech budgets continue to increase, hiring continue to increase. While this may not be true for other areas, investment in tech remains strong. The key areas of investment continue to be analytics automation, and AI,” Wang said.

He added, “Mega deals are a hedge for both the buyer and the IT services provider. Given the shortage of labour, these deals ensure stability. We’ll probably see more as we see contracts consolidated in 2023.”

Currently, technology clients are cooling down from the pace at which they grew in the past couple of years. Having said that, technology has now also become more of a non-discretionary spend for most companies.

“The long 10-year arc of digital transformation has resulted in a much more intimate and dynamic relationship between operations and technology. This has moved substantial tranches of IT work from discretionary to essential and has established a much higher demand floor than in past recessions. Hence we are seeing demand stay strong in the EU, which is clearly much deeper into a recession than the US,” said Samuel.

Fersht, however, believes that the mega deals era is gone amidst the increasing need for profitability.

“The mega deal days are pretty much behind us, unless a service provider is willing to take a calculated risk to consolidate services for an enterprise client. I see service providers more focused on profitability than mere growth, especially as we grapple with the next 2-3 quarters, which are likely to be very challenging,” he said.

Where do the IT companies stand?

Albeit with an air of caution, all the companies remain bullish on client spending and demand outlook for large deals in the upcoming quarters.

At Infosys, which counts deals in the $50 million-plus revenue band as large deals, CEO Salil Parekh said during the Q2FY23 earnings conference with analysts that the company had begun a pivot towards cost-focussed programmes within the large deal pipeline. Infosys’ operating model and offerings are agile, and can deliver value for clients in this evolving macro environment, said Parekh.

He added, “We had great growth in Q1 and Q2, and we continue to see that the overall pipeline for large deals is quite strong, in fact, it is larger than it was in the last couple of quarters. We also see macro points …, specifically mortgages in financial services, some aspects of retail or hi-tech or telecom. So, keeping all that in mind we came with a view on the (revenue) guidance, which was 14% to 16% earlier, and are now moving it to 15% to 16%, which is the higher end of that band.”

Addressing HCLTech’s Q2FY23 earnings conference, C Vijayakumar, CEO and MD, said, “…since January, we have increased prices and we continue to win deals, which are at a higher margin than what we would have won in the previous fiscal. And when you win large deals … depending on the deal size, we’ve generally been engaged in deals where we don’t have to take any major upfront kind of investments, that’s been the strategy as well. So, there’ll be a little moderation to start with and then the margins will pick up in large deals.”

TCS, which won two mega deals of almost a billion dollars each in Q1, didn’t have any mega deals in Q2. Addressing the media, CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said, “We don’t have any mega wins, the largest one is in that range of 400 million and we have a few in that plus minus range. Deal wins are large but nothing above 500 million per se to call out.”

Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte said that the company is experiencing a real shift in the market as clients increasingly turn to them. “And based on all these factors, we remain confident of gaining market share in the coming quarters,” he said.

Speaking on operating margin levers, Delaporte said, “What are the levers? Continue to drive our fresher strategy; continue to progress on automation, where we’ve also made some significant investment; continue to go for larger deals; continue to go for deals delivering more value, and not only going after volume.”",1397,0.17401097218195596

Vineet Nayar, founder and chairman of the Sampark Foundation and former CEO of HCLTech, said that moonlighting is inevitable and is made worse by low compensation pay and a lack of opportunities for innovation, despite efforts by Indian IT service companies to tackle the practice.

With the growing culture of entrepreneurship and start-ups in India, it will be impossible to stop moonlighting entirely, as most start-ups and even many Indian IT firms began as side hustles of the founders while they worked full-time for established organisations, Nayar explained.

Moonlighting is the act of working secretly at a second job while working full-time at a company. In the last two years, the pandemic has made it possible for IT workers to work from home. As a result, IT workers have started doing freelance and gig work on the side, which in some cases has put client data at risk.

Taking a cue from the internet revolution, Nayar told Moneycontrol, “When internet came to our life, we resisted big time thinking that our data will be stolen. But it was unstoppable -- it came to our desktops, mobile phones and even watches. And since people couldn’t do anything about it so they learned to use it rather than being abused by it.”

“Moonlighting too is an unstoppable event. You can resist it but you can’t stop it. You need to understand the reasons behind it,” the industry veteran added.

Nayar believes that moonlighting should be well-regulated to protect client confidentiality, but it can't be stopped.

Growing salary disparity

According to Nayar, there are three key drivers of moonlighting in the IT sector: the widening gap between the salaries of freshers versus top management, the lack of purpose and innovation in the profit-driven culture of IT companies and the growing start-up economy.

Nayar highlighted that the salary for an IT engineer with 0–2 years of experience is a pittance. At that salary level, which remains stagnant with only up to 8 percent increase year-on-year, there is a desire for the young engineers to earn well and make ends meet.

“For a salary of Rs. 30,000-35,000 where will you stay and what will you do? Especially when employees from tier-II cities are coming to tier-I cities to work, managing expenses gets more difficult. They end up picking gigs outside their jobs to make ends meet, whether it is driving Uber cabs or doing something else,” he said.

He added, “Unless you increase your salaries dramatically which IT companies can due to margin pressures, there will be a dire need for this employee to find economic needs to meet his or her ends.”

According to an earlier report by Moneycontrol, while the median annual pay of CEOs zoomed 835 percent from FY12 to FY22, the median salary package of freshers grew just 45 percent in the same period. Over the last decade, the median fresher salary rose from Rs 2.45 lakh in FY12 to Rs 3.55 lakh in FY22.

Disengaged employees

IT consultancy services companies are increasingly becoming revenue and profit-driven companies, often lacking a culture of purpose as they are not necessarily building new products.

“The amount of disenchantment with these organisations is at its peak. Most of the surveys are saying that the employees are completely disengaged. Most of these companies are running behind profits and revenue growth, and not behind purpose. Therefore the employees are not aligned and end up becoming use and throw commodities and nobody is investing in them,” Nayar said.

“The third driver is the gig economy of start-ups. Until last year, if you look at all the major companies in the Indian IT sector and track the history till last year. Everybody was happy to say how they started their companies and all of them at that point were employed with other companies. It remained a side hustle until it became a successful company,” he said.

“Was that not moonlighting? Today also you are on boards of various companies, doing multiple things, is that not moonlighting? Moonlighting already exists,” Nayar questioned.

Companies taking strict measures

Most of the top Indian IT companies including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, IBM, TechMahindra, and Larsen & Toubro Infotech (LTI) to name a few have made their stance on the issue known.

Without classifying it as ""moonlighting,"" Infosys has established guidelines for employees to pursue side gigs while keeping managers informed of their activities. Previously, Infosys had warned employees through email that they would be fired if caught moonlighting.

IBM India and South Asia MD Sandip Patel wrote an email to his employees, defining the act of moonlighting and what activities will be considered moonlighting under IBM’s purview.

Wipro fired over 300 employees who were found moonlighting while working on client-sensitive data in the company. Chairman Rishad Premji has been outspoken in his opposition to the subject.

Meanwhile, TCS communicated to its staff that the moonlighting was unethical.

“The only way to control this river is to create a dam but keep releasing the water at certain intervals so the dam doesn’t break. What you guys are trying to create a dam and work on conflict of interest,” Nayar said about the sector’s practices.",873,-0.594698813828555

According to a report released by Nasscom and job portal Indeed in partnership with financial services firm AON, almost 65 percent or two-thirds of the 70 organisations surveyed had employed gig workers in 2022.

This is a slightly higher share as compared to 57 percent organisations opting for gig workers in 2020. Though the share of organizations employing gig workers has increased, their proportion remains less than 5 percent of the total workforce (for companies with more than 2000 full-time employees (FTEs).

However, for smaller organizations with less than 2000 FTEs, gig worker proportion is more than 5 percent.

Gig worker economy is expected to have a gross volume of approximately $455 billion globally by 2023. Indian gig workforce is expected to touch 23.4 million by FY30.

IT companies leading the way

Apart from internal and external gig workers and freelancers focused platforms, top Indian IT services companies like Tata Consultancy Services TCS) and Infosys have their own internal gig work platforms, which help them deploy their own employees for short-duration projects.

Wipro, meanwhile, has an external gig work platform called Topcoder, a global crowdsourcing company with an open global community of over 1.5 million designers, developers, data scientists, and competitive programmers.

Moreover, moonlighting or employees taking up dual jobs have been a cause of concern for the Indian IT sector lately, especially with remote working being the norm and talent shortage. Most of these IT companies don’t approve of moonlighting without prior approval of managers as the companies deal with a lot of confidential data of clients.

Ironically, Wipro had fired nearly 300 employees on finding them moonlighting.

Increased duration and pay

With increasing demand, the duration for which gig workers are employed have also gone up from nine months to more than 12 months, at least for the 25 percent organisations who were open to employ for longer duration.

Compensation, too, has become more structured depending on the skill sets and expertise of the gig workers. “Over 40 pecent of the surveyed organizations decide on a Fixed Fee at the initiation of a Gig Contract. As many as 53% of the surveyed organizations have policies to absorb Gig Workers as full-time employees. Moreover, over 90 percent of the surveyed organizations remain open to re-hiring gig workers in the same or adjacent areas of work based on past performance evaluation,” the report said.

Debjani Ghosh, President, NASSCOM said, “The future workforce will indeed be a blended model wherein the Gig economy is expected to play an important role not only as a talent management strategy but also accelerate job creation and boost the country’s economic growth. As we navigate the new world order, multiple models will co-exist with trust and transparency at the core of it.”

Growing talent pool

Currently, India is well positioned in terms of talent availability. It has the 2nd largest annual supply of STEM graduates, 4x-4.5x higher than the USA, and is also a leader in terms of women diversity among STEM Graduates at 47.1 percent.

“Though the accelerated demand for digital transformation has intensified the talent crunch globally, the gig workforce has emerged as an important talent management strategy for organizations and can play a key role in closing the tech talent demand-supply gap,” the report added.",572,0.3368174930413564

“India provides value added IT services to the world. IT sector in India has never de-grown in volume terms. There might be fears about de-growth now but September numbers have been phenomenal. The order book has, in fact, gone up for IT companies,” Singhania said during the round table.

IBM India has issued a word of caution to employees not to moonlight without following proper procedures. In an internal email to employees, IBM India MD Sandip Patel reiterated the company's stance and policies on moonlighting and discouraged it, as well as any personal activities undertaken at the expense of IBM's interests.

In the note, which Moneycontrol reviewed, Patel said that he wanted to be clear with his employees about the ""much talked about"" topic of moonlighting, adding that it could create a lot of confusion if not explained at a granular level.

“Simply put, 'moonlighting' is commonly referred to as having a second job in addition to one's regular, full-time employment,” he said in the note.

This is not the first time Patel spoke about moonlighting. During the company's flagship event, 'Think 2022,' in September, Patel said that he agreed with Wipro Chairman Rishad Premji's view on moonlighting and that he was against dual employment, calling it “not ethically right.”

According to the internal note, IBM’s employment contracts require employees to refrain from being involved in any other employment or business in any role or capacity, particularly if it is a competitor, while employed with IBM.

“IBM’s Business Conduct Guidelines (BCGs) also make it clear under Guidelines 7.1 and 7.2 that while an IBMers' time outside of work is their own, it also requires them to avoid engaging in activities that create a conflict of interest with IBM’s business. IBM’s BCGs highlight that providing assistance to a competitor in any capacity is a clear conflict of interest,” the note said.

“At IBM, our stance has always been clear: we encourage every IBMer to bring their whole selves to work. Your passion – be it for art, dance, or music is celebrated here, and in that spirit, we’d love to see you pursue your interests. However, if you advance a personal interest, whether directly or indirectly, at the expense of IBM’s interests, it is treated as a serious conflict of interest and a violation of trust,” the note added.

In terms of examples of what could constitute a violation of such policies, Patel said that while an employee is allowed to run a small business, doing so during work hours at IBM will interfere with the employee's official duties to the company.

”IBM’s policy is also fundamentally important to the trust our clients place in IBM when they entrust us with the transformation, access, and management of critical commercial assets, including their data and systems,” the note added.

This development comes after peers like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech and LTI have come out with their stance on moonlighting. In September, a similar letter was sent out by Infosys to its employees internally warning them that moonlighting could lead to termination. Wipro’s Premji said it had already fired around 300 employees who were found to be working for competitors on a freelance basis.

HCLTech and TCS, too, discouraged their employees from moonlighting.

Meanwhile, Infosys is working on an internal policy to limit moonlighting. As per the policy, the company will allow employees to take up certain side gigs, but with the prior approval of the managers.",533,-0.9952511489391327

The move, a mandate to employees with consequences if they do not follow the roster, did not go down well. For some employees, this means travelling over 100km to their offices, as they had moved during the lockdown and now have children going to school. For others, it’s a question of flexibility after two years, and are questioning if the company’s 25x25 model will really be implemented.

The model is that only 25 percent of TCS employees will be in an office at any given point by 2025, and employees will not need to spend more than 25 percent of their time in office.

While TCS is the only IT major to have mandated it so far, others have used words such as “encourage”, asking people to return to work a few times each week.

It has been quite the year for the companies, as they battle moonlighting by employees, elevated attrition rates, and a significant portion of their workforce never having set foot in an office. For employees, a return to work mandate is forcing some of them to look for a change.

What the companies say

TCS: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is the only one so far among the IT giants to set a clear mandate to return to offices. TCS has told employees to return to work three times a week, with managers creating a roster. Adherence to this roster is mandatory and will be tracked, according to an email sent to employees. “...any noncompliance will be taken seriously, and administrative measures may be applied.”

While announcing the company's results for the second quarter of FY23, Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said that all of the company's seniors are coming to the office.

“The remaining staff, we are rostering all of them…today the situation is one-third of our workforce is coming to the office at least two times a week. This number will continue to increase,” he said.

Wipro: Wipro, too, said in an email to employees that offices would be open four times a week, with employees encouraged to return three times a week. It, however, did not mandate this.

This began on October 10, and Wipro CHRO Saurabh Govil said that the intent clearly is to reconnect people and to return to offices.

“All our offices, especially in India, are open four days a week and we expect leadership to be here three days a week. We're also giving them flexibility, but we also want connectedness. It's truly a hybrid model in terms of how we want to take it forward. Let's see how it evolves over a period of time,” Govil said.

Wipro’s Chairperson Rishad Premji has been a big supporter of bringing people back to offices. At a NASSCOM event last week, Premji said that 1 lakh people have joined the company in the last thirty months, but the company had less than 10 percent of people coming in. He said 30 percent of the company's employees live in tier-2 and tier-3 cities.

“It’s a huge challenge. How do you build a sense of belonging to an organisation? Many of these people simply get a paycheck from the company and are engaged with a few of their leaders, typically on a collaborative medium. Connectedness is lost at some level,” he said, adding that he’s a “big believer” that all people should return to the office for some of the time.

Infosys: Returning to office is not yet a mandate at Infosys, and the company’s leadership said they support a flexible approach.

Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Salil Parekh said at a press conference following the release of the company's Q2 results that 45,000 employees were present in the office at any given time in early October. Compared to where the industry was a few months ago, he stated that this was a massive figure. This, he noted, was a huge number compared to where the industry stood a few months ago.

“We have been extremely supportive of a flexible approach, it has been well received and it is working. We are seeing that this is now gradually increasing…My sense is that over time, we will make all the support necessary so more and more employees can come back.”

He also said that a growing number of employees are returning to the office on their own, with the number increasing by the week.

“We want to make sure that we build things in the future which keep this element of flexibility and make sure that we address client-specific needs, but we want to make sure that it is something that our employees are comfortable with,” Parekh said.

This is especially significant given that Infosys was the first of the IT majors to unveil a policy allowing employees to take on side gigs with prior managerial approval amid moonlighting concerns.

HCLTech: Chief People Officer Ramachandran Sundararajan said that the company is adopting a hybrid operating model. He stressed that people have been encouraged to come to office three times a week, but there is no mandate.

“The way we have tried to manage it is to empower our project managers who are better equipped to decide what makes sense for their projects, their deliverables and their client commitments. It's managed in a decentralised way from that point of view,” he said, adding that the company’s footfall in offices has increased.

Working from the office three times a week is expected at the leadership level, he added.

CEO C Vijayakumar stressed that the operating model has changed forever, and people are not going to always come to the office and work.

How is this move likely to fare?

Even though India Inc. allows for flexibility and encourages employees to return to work on occasion, it may take time for the change to be accepted.

A survey by CIEL HR Services of employees from 19 tech giants found that 46 percent of respondents want to quit their jobs because they now lack the ability to work from office. It also particularly puts working mothers in a tight spot, as they figure out how to manage their children while continuing to work.

In addition, among mid-to-senior level employees, the survey said that 8 percent of employees plan to quit “as they see their employer’s demand of return to work is restrictive, curtails their independence and affects their lifestyle they have found endearing.”

Similarly, according to a poll conducted by HR Solutions company Aon, 68 percent of employers returned to the office following a hybrid model in August, up from 46 percent in January of this year. It also revealed that Information Technology Enabled Services (ITeS) was one of the leading industries adopting hybrid, accounting for 79 percent.

Only 16 percent of hi-tech or IT companies were operating virtually, it said.

Microsoft’s 2022 Work Trend Index Pulse Report signalled that there may also be a difference in perception between employees and leaders. Ninety-three percent of employees in India had said they are productive at work, but 91 percent of leaders said the shift to hybrid work made it challenging to have confidence in employees being productive.

In addition, a whopping 80 percent of employees in India said they need a better reason to come to work than company expectations. Motivators that could incentivise them to return to work include socialising with coworkers and reestablishing team relationships.",1254,-0.23717236518859863

IT majors Wipro and TCS have recalled employees to work from office, but having experienced the advantages of working from home, not all employees are enthusiastic about returning to work from office. Several among them are now looking for opportunities to that offer them more flexibility in terms of where they work from, a study has found.

According to a recent survey by staffing services firm CIEL HR Services, which covered 1,000 respondents from 19 leading IT companies, around 88 per cent of employees in major IT companies are ready to quit their current jobs instead of returning to the offices. It also includes about 46 per cent working mothers and caregivers are seeking work from home (WFH) opportunities.

While another 46 per cent are willing to leave for better paying jobs, others want to quit because they see their employer’s orders of returning to office as restrictive, making them spend time on commuting and preventing them from pursuing other hobbies and passions, a report in Economic Times stated.

“Return to offices curtails their independence and affects their lifestyle,” said CIEL CEO Aditya Misra.

But while employees are responding to calls to return to office with resignation threats, this might not work out well for the employees amid a slight slowdown in hiring, Times Now reported.

“Threats of this nature might have had teeth a few months back in the candidate-controlled job market,” said Anil Ethanur, cofounder at staffing firm Xpheno. Officials at Adecco and Xpheno said they expect employees to mostly toe the line as companies call them back to offices.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, and HCLTech, the top four Indian IT companies, all reported positive to mixed numbers for the second quarter, which ended on September 30.

Despite worries about an impending recession, inflation, US H-1B visa delays, a toughening environment in major markets like north America, the UK, and Europe, and delays in hiring freshers, the IT sector showed resilience this quarter as demand stayed stable.

Commentary from company executives largely conveyed that demand remains strong, with only a few pockets experiencing a slowdown. However, company executives expressed caution and stated that they were keeping a close eye on the situation.

While TCS and HCLTech outperformed analyst expectations in terms of key performance metrics, the other two lagged slightly.

TCS and HCLTech beat analyst estimates with revenue growth of 4 and 3.8 percent QoQ (quarter-on-quarter) in constant currency (CC) terms, respectively.

While Infosys too grew by around 4 percent QoQ in CC terms, it missed estimates that were pegged at 4.5-5 percent. Though it had missed revenue estimates, Infosys beat analyst estimates on profit. For the year, Infosys tightened its revenue guidance and upped it on the lower end —from 14-16 percent to 15-16 percent.

In CC terms, Wipro's revenue grew by 4.1 percent from the previous quarter. Wipro projected revenue growth of 0.5-2 percent in constant currency terms for the December quarter. However, it maintained its guidance for double-digit growth in FY23.

Given healthy bookings in the first half and expectations of a strong deal pipeline for the upcoming quarters, HCLTech’s management revised overall revenue guidance for FY23 to 13.5-14.5 percent YoY CC growth, from earlier 12-14 percent YoY growth.

Deal wins

While all the companies reported healthy and stable deal wins this quarter and bullish expectations for the upcoming quarter, they remained wary of the ongoing global market uncertainty. TCS and Infosys have highlighted delays in deal closure conversations with clients. TCS also added that some sectors like retail and insurance have started to show signs of a slowdown in the US.

Regarding Infosys, analysts at ICICI securities said in their report: “Signs of cautious behaviour among clients are visible in terms of delay in decision-making in select verticals. Management pointed to emerging weakness in telecom and high-tech verticals, especially in discretionary spends, apart from the retail and mortgage sub-segment in BFSI called out in the previous quarter.”

Wipro too reported healthy total contract value (TCV) growth of 24 percent YoY (year-on-year) in Q2. HCL Tech also clocked a strong TCV, with new deal wins at $2.38 billion, growing at around 6 percent YoY and 16 percent QoQ. It reported annual contract value (ACV) growth of about 23.5 percent YoY. It won a mega deal with an ACV of $125 million over 5 years. Its products and platform business helped in closing this new deal.

Operating margins

Operating margins have been under pressure, leading to companies slashing employees’ variable pay last quarter. This fiscal has seen the erosion of margins due to supply-side pressures, wage inflation, higher travel costs, etc. However, some constraints have begun to ease.

The July-September quarter benefited from several tailwinds such as a weakening rupee, easing travel restrictions, lower subcontracting costs, and reduced wage hike pressures. With attrition subsiding, companies are now focussed on utilisation and realisation. All of this has led to an improvement in margins across the board.

Infosys lowered its EBIT margin guidance on the upper end. The company, which had previously said that its EBIT margin would be within 21-23 percent, narrowed it to 21-22 percent.

“Looking at margin levers going ahead, there will be some abatement from the attrition side, but because it is a seasonally weak quarter, we will have headwinds due to furloughs and lower working days. We will try to offset some of these through cost optimisation, etc. Therefore, like we said, 21-22 is a narrow band which we will be comfortable with for this year,” Infosys CFO Nilanjan Roy said while addressing the press after the earnings call.

HCLTech’s management narrowed its EBIT margin guidance to 18-19 percent from 18-20 percent earlier for FY23.

Attrition

Elevated attrition has been a pain point for several quarters for IT companies, and it continues to remain above 20 percent. However, it may be the beginning of the end of demand far exceeding supply, causing an employee’s market with fizzy salaries.

Company managements have said that attrition has begun to reduce on a quarterly basis, even though it remains elevated on an LTM (last twelve months) basis. TCS was the only one of the four major firms to see an uptick in attrition. HCLTech was flat on a sequential basis, while Infosys saw a decline, and Wipro’s slight downward trajectory continued.

Hiring

After the crazy numbers that companies hired in 2021, there is saturation-related moderation in the sectors that over-hired last year, leading to a reduction in job openings in the IT sector.

Net employee addition has reduced, and is down 45 percent from last quarter. The second quarter is typically a strong hiring quarter for the companies in question. The commentary by companies is that they want to use the manpower they have hired, as well as train freshers and bring them up to speed.

The dip in net employee addition comes at a time when companies are delaying on-boarding and making offers to freshers. While companies say that all offers made will be honoured, except HCL Tech, all these firms saw a decline in net adds in Q2 compared to Q1. Wipro saw the steepest decline — from 15,446 in Q1 to 605 in Q2.",941,-0.01890021044275035

Funding commitments for digital push remain intact despite a challenging macro-economic environment, the chief executive of India's No. 1 information technology service provider Tata Consultancy Services Ltd said on Monday.

After reporting quarterly results last week, India's IT service providers indicated that companies that were splurging top dollar during the pandemic have turned cautious in regions such as Europe and the United States.

The pandemic unlocked a lot of funding commitments in terms of digital transformation, TCS Chief Executive Rajesh Gopinathan told Reuters.

""When you look forward, for the next 12 to 18 months, that excitement level (towards digital transformation) has died down, but the funding commitments have not gone away. What we are getting into is the second leg of these transformation journeys, which is very critical.""

Gopinathan earlier this year completed five years as the CEO of the IT behemoth and was reappointed for another five years till 2027.

Mumbai-based TCS reported better-than-expected quarterly results last week, but flagged that long-term deal decision making remained soft due to macro-economic challenges.

However, the company added that it expects demand momentum to continue across all markets.

July-September order book was steady and stood at $8.1 billion, consisting of several small- and medium-sized deals rather than large ones, according to TCS.

""We are equally interested in large and small deals. But as the environment turns more uncertain, deal sizes typically become smaller,"" Gopinathan said.",247,0.621284027894338
2022-10-14 18:07:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/it/it-hiring-employee-addition-by-tcs-infosys-wipro-hcl-tech-down-45-in-q2-compared-to-q1-9331001.html,"India's largest software exporters TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and HCL Tech together added 28,836 employees in the second quarter ended September, a significant drop of 45 percent compared to the 52,842 they added in the previous quarter.

A lower net addition number, in what is typically a strong hiring quarter for IT companies, signifies caution, analysts said, as the environment turns challenging in their major markets such as North America, the United Kingdom, and Europe.

TCS’s net addition during the quarter was 9,840 employees, down from 14,136 in Q1. For TCS, this was an eight-quarter low in terms of net addition.

During the company’s call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan said that the company has been investing in headcount addition all of last year and that the company has taken a call to significantly expand employee onboarding, especially entry-level employees.

“We had hired close to 1,20,000 freshers last year and invested into that pool, given the longer-term visibility that we see on the demand. We will complete our employee model on an ongoing basis, looking at the demand. So that is a reasonable expectation, but our overall hiring model is predicated on a much longer cycle than short-term quarter-on-quarter adjustments,” he said.

Wipro’s net addition saw a steep fall in the July-Sept quarter, adding just 605 employees as opposed to the previous quarter’s 15,446. When asked about the decrease in net headcount addition, Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte said they had an exceptional volume of hiring in Q1 due to the demand. He added that the company knew it would take a while before the talent is utilised, and in the second quarter as well, they followed their strategy of onboarding freshers. This, he said, will continue going forward too.

Infosys on the other hand saw its net addition halve — from 21,171 in Q1 to 10,032 in Q2. Speaking to Moneycontrol, CEO Salil Parekh said the company had hired over 80,000 college graduates last year and over 20,000 people last quarter, which was a strong addition cumulatively.

“We want to make sure that all of these employees are going through the training and getting deployed on these programs. Our view is we will continue to look at this situation keeping in mind our large deals, our growth, and what we see in the macro, and make decisions as the macro evolves depending on what the stimulants are,” he said.

HCL Tech was the outlier in this case, with its net addition going from 2,046 to 8,359 — a 4x increase sequentially. HCL CEO C Vijayakumar said in Q3 and Q4 of FY22, the company had a net addition of around 10,000; in Q1 FY23 it was down, as, at the time, the capacity they had built up was getting utilised. “Now we've reached a certain scale on that and we've again started hiring,” he said, on the company’s jump on net addition.

Fresher addition and attrition

However, even as net additions have dropped, fresher hiring continues across companies amid elevated attrition and freshers alleging that offers have been delayed for months.

TCS has said it has honoured all job offers it has made, and Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte said all offers made will be honoured.

HCL Tech added 10,339 freshers during the quarter, the most it has ever added in a single quarter. Its target is to add about 30,000 freshers this fiscal. CEO Vijayakumar said that the September quarter is when the maximum number of freshers join, which is why the fresher addition number peaked.

TCS onboarded 20,000 freshers in Q2, and expects to add 10-12,000 more freshers in FY23.

Infosys said the company has hired 40,000 in the first half of the fiscal year and may revise its target of 50,000 for the full FY upwards.

Wipro hired around 4,000 freshers during the quarter, and 14,000 in the first half of the fiscal year.

Attrition, however, continues to elevate, even as companies have started seeing a decline. TCS’ attrition went from 19.7 percent to 21.5 percent, Wipro’s declined from 23.3 percent to 23 percent, Infosys’ also declined from 28.4 percent to 27.1 percent and HCLTech’s remained at 23.8 percent on a sequential basis.

Moderation in demand

Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, a partner at tech advisory firm Catalincs and former Chairman and MD at Cognizant India, told Moneycontrol that the quarter ending September is usually the best quarter for Indian IT, both in terms of revenue and headcount growth.

""The full impact of client technology budgets is usually seen in this quarter, and likewise, the largest number of freshers from campus are onboarded this quarter,"" he said,

This year, however, he added that while revenue growth during this quarter was largely robust, net headcount addition has been 'quite anaemic' for two reasons.

""One, there is caution in the air with respect to the sustainability of robust demand. Two, there has been an unusually significant front-loading of capacity in the December 2022 and March 2023 quarters in anticipation of strong demand,"" he said.

Apurva Prasad, Vice-President Institutional Research, at HDFC Securities, said that net addition numbers this quarter have to do with the fresher intakes as well as the elevated attrition on an LTM (last-twelve-month) basis.

He added that Q2 is usually a strong quarter for addition, and companies like Infosys have still done well in terms of addition.

The net addition, he added, is “also an indication of demand ahead, which is also reflected in TCV (total contract value) numbers. There is moderation in demand, it’s a linear model.”

Mitul Shah, Head of Research at Reliance Securities said there is an element of caution which is visible in the slowdown in hiring, and hiring numbers aren’t likely to be revised in the immediate quarters.

This also comes at a time when the active job openings in the IT sector for the month of September were the lowest in 17 months, according to data from staffing firm Xpheno. As per the report, the IT sector's share of active job openings has dropped to 58 percent, from an 80 percent-plus range in the previous year.

“Certain key talent sectors that saw hyper-action during the buoyant quarters of the previous fiscal are dealing with a saturation effect. The macroeconomic slowdown has given a breather for enterprises to take stock and calibrate their hiring plans,” Xpheno co-founder Anil Ethanur said.",1056,-0.3746580593287945

A recession in the US has historically been a positive thing for India, according to Saurabh Mukherjea, founder of Marcellus Investment Managers.

First, a US recession leads to a fall in crude oil prices which benefits India's Balance of Payments. Second, it brings down 'the cost of money'.

""So if you look back at the last 40 years, we never had a stock market boom in our country without a recession in America,"" Mukherjea told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.

""The reason a US recession historically has been good for India is twofold. It conks of oil prices and brings down the cost of money,"" he said.

Assessing the prospects of IT stocks from a medium to long-term perspective, Mukherjea said that companies like TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech have been performing well and expects the upbeat performance to continue based on healthy results.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Despite a challenging global business environment and over 11-month delay in US H-1B visa processing, subcontracting costs at top Indian IT firms such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, and Wipro have begun to trend downwards, according to their performance reported for the second quarter of FY23, which ended September 30, 2022.

The managements of these companies have maintained a bullish outlook for subcontracting costs to improve further in the coming quarters, which will aid in improving operating margins.

TCS, which had quarterly subcontracting costs of around 7 percent of revenue levels last fiscal year, saw them rise to 9.7 percent in Q1FY23; however, in Q2FY23, it started plunging by 10 bps, reaching 9.6 percent of revenue, according to analyst reports.

HCLTech's subcontracting costs (or overall outsourced services costs) fell from 15.3 percent of revenue in the previous quarter to 15 percent of revenue in Q2FY23 reducing by 30 bps. Meanwhile, Infosys' subcontracting costs fell sequentially from 10.5 percent of revenue to 10.1 percent, a 40 bps correction. Wipro's subcontracting costs fell to 12.9 percent in the second quarter, down from 13.7 percent previously.

It was cited as one of the key levers that helped the companies improve their operating margins this quarter.

During the analyst call for Q2 earnings, Salil Parekh, CEO and MD of Infosys, explained, “…the impact on margin is what is the premium you're paying to subcontractors over employee. So it's just not a mathematical impact of subcontractor costs coming down from 11 percent to 10 percent. By that token, if we say if we can bring down subcontractors to zero, margin can go up by 10 percent. So this is just a premium you're paying to subcontractors which is impacting your margin.”

TCS CFO Samir Seksaria told the media,“Subcontracting costs have started to trend downwards and we expect that to continue. Especially because supply side challenges are easing out and then reliance on subcontractors will trend down.”

Subcontracting costs trends, according to Amit Chandra, Deputy Vice President, HDFC Securities, is very company specific and will depend on the type of deals they win.

“Benefits of subcontracting costs are already visible in Infosys and to some extent in TCS. For instance, Infosys got the Daimler deal, which was a larger deal, where the need for subcontracting was much higher. In comparison, TCS didn’t have any subcontracting-heavy deals yet. That’s why the subcontracting cost share in Infosys is on the higher side due to this one deal,” he told Moneycontrol.

“But at a sectorial level, the benefits of subcontracting costs has still not come in and it’s still early days to say subcontracting costs have started benefiting the margins. Subcontracting is a tool cater to additional demand. And whenever you don’t have that kind of a demand it is very easy to cut subcontracting costs,” Chandra added.

He explained that the need for subcontracting is especially important for time-sensitive larger transformational projects that require immediate action. Other cost-cutting and deal-optimization-related tech projects, on the other hand, will not rely as much on subcontracting.

Mrinal Rai, Principal Analyst at technology research firm ISG, said that companies are now hiring more in offshore locations, echoing Seksaria and TCS' comments about supply side challenges being alleviated by newer deployment and hiring.

“Well, as per latest data we have seen hiring by providers increasing across regions so it could indicate that providers are hiring in those countries instead of sub contracting,” Rai told Moneycontrol.

Following the footsteps of its peers including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Wipro and Infosys, HCLTech on October 12 came clear with its stance of moonlighting. While discussing its second quarter results, the IT services major said that it doesn’t approve of this ‘dual employment’ and expects employees to honour their contracts expecting them to maintain exclusivity.

Ram Sundararajan, chief people officer at HCLTech said while addressing the media, “Dual employment while working for HCLTech— we don’t approve of that. Everybody who works for HCLTech is signing up for an employment contract which requires exclusivity. There are requirements around confidentiality, non-solicitation, non-compete etc. all those provisions that are there we expect our employees would honour those.”

“Having said that, if people do have hobbies and preferences they want to pursue in their free time, we leave it to individual choices,” he added.

The company said that it, fortunately, hasn’t had any active cases of moonlighting barring one or two stray instances which is being investigated.

This comes just days after TCS condemned moonlighting as unethical and against the company's values and culture. The management even said that it has ""codified"" this in its employee contracts, and that they are not permitted to work elsewhere. The company has already communicated its position on moonlighting to its employees, though no action has been taken against anyone so far.

Moonlighting is increasingly becoming a cause of concern for the Indian IT sector, particularly as attrition rates remain high and the business environment remains challenging. With remote work becoming the norm, employees are able to take up a second job during their spare time.

Rishad Premji, the chairman of Wipro, recently said that the company had fired around 300 employees after finding them working for competitors.

Infosys, on the other hand, has already issued a strong warning to its employees via email last month, threatening them with termination if they are found moonlighting.

Outlook on hybrid work

HCLTech is opting for a hybrid work model just like its peers. The company has already “encouraged” employees to work from office three days a week, but has not made it mandatory.

As per Sundararajan, it is being rolled out in a decentralised way, wherein project managers get to decide who should come in depending on work requirements.

CEO C Vijayakumar emphasised that the hybrid work operating model is here to stay.

“We have reached out to our employees in so many different towns. We went to 20 small locations where we did not have offices earlier. Around 500-1000 people participate during our town halls from those locations,” he said.

TCS and Wipro has already asked employees to mandatorily work from office for three days a week from October onwards.",462,-0.9999960660934448

Macquarie Capital's Ravi Menon said Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has higher exposure to life and annuity insurance applications. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Menon shared his views on the outlook of TCS and Infosys's share buyback proposal.

He said, ""People are worried about the net hiring being weak and that being an indication of poor demand. I don’t think that. We think they have built a big buffer of bench, if you come from pre-COVID to now. They are at nearly 38 percent of headcount while revenue is up by only 23 percent.""

TCS on Monday said its attrition rate in the July-September period had jumped to 21.5 percent versus 19.70 percent quarter-on-quarter.

Menon also opined that Europe's manufacturing woes will get over in the next few months while adding that Infosys has a large part of deals in Europe.

Looking at TCS' margin picture which was reported at 24 percent but had a currency impact on it, Menon said, ""The currency does play a role in this. You'll have at least another 200-300 basis points at revenue utilisation and that will flow down straight to the markets which then gets back to the 26-28 percent band.""

He also added that as attrition starts coming down, naturally margin would start moving up.

TCS reported an annualised 8.4 percent growth in net income at Rs 10,431 crore for the September quarter. The Tata Group company said its total revenue from services grew at a much faster pace of 18 percent to touch Rs 54,309 crore in the period under review.

Discussing companies with the highest exposure to insurance, Menon informed that TCS is a little bit higher in that regard. ""Especially because they are insuring banks as well but that is primarily on the life and annuity side.""

Also commenting on the delaying of the hiring process in regards to Wipro, Infosys, HCL Tech and the likes, Menon said, ""We are looking at pretty healthy growth from all the firms. We are looking at marginal improvement also ranging from 40-60 basis points."" He added, ""Every year... some offers are cancelled anyway. I wouldn't really be worried too much.""

Meanwhile, Infosys said that the board would consider a buyback of shares on Thursday, with the earnings for the quarter ended September.

According to media reports, TCS has won a $2-billion contract with state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) for 4G and 5G rollout.

TCS will develop the BSNL’s 4G core and build radio access network (RAN)-based solutions. India’s leading IT services firm, however, did not announce or mention this deal during its second-quarter earnings call on October 10.

""5G is a great opportunity. It has the potential to be leveraged by every business. Telecom will increasingly become horizontal on which every vertical will start to develop benefits and efficiencies,"" TCS COO N Ganapathy Subramaniam said during the earnings call.

There would be significant innovations to watch for in sectors such as life sciences, healthcare, education, and agriculture and the company would remain actively focused on them, he said.

“In manufacturing, industry 4.0 principles can actually become a reality. You’ll need applications and private network to connect internally and meaningfully with the ecosystem.

“We are looking at all those possibilities both on the telcos side in terms of managing a very efficient network, and rolling out 5G, co-existence with 4G, handoffs with 4G. Providing the necessary finesse and experience to the consumers that they are looking for,” Subramaniam said.

The company had taken up digital farming very seriously and also manufacturing efficiencies, logistics and “how we can automate, work with robotics, and 5G together. We have built many such solutions”, he said.

On October 1, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched 5G telephony in the country. The fifth generation of telecommunication technology is expected to be a game changer for IT and telcos.

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCS

TCS reported revenue of USD6.87b in 2QFY23, up 4.0% QoQ in constant currency (CC) terms, 50bp above our estimates. The company reported deal wins of USD8.1b (up 7% YoY/flat QoQ, book-to-bill ratio at 1.2x), in line with its historical trajectory. EBIT improved 90bp QoQ to 24% (vs. our estimate of 23.5%) despite supply pressures. Lower employee expenses, operating leverage, and lower sub-contractor expenses aided margins in 2QFY23. LTM attrition jumped 180bp to 21.5%. The management has indicated that quarterly annualized attrition should moderate starting 3QFY23. Management commentary on the demand environment and deal pipeline remained intact with no visible impact of weakening macro environment; however, the management has indicated risks to deal pipeline and conversion in Europe due to uncertainty around energy prices. TCS is seeing some caution for longer term deals and is experiencing some delayed decision making in Europe, but it continues to see a strong spending environment in the US. While the optimistic commentary was on expected lines, we remain concerned on the near-term growth due to macro slowdown. We are factoring in USD revenue growth of 7.5% YoY in FY23, owing to the macro headwinds in the second half of the year along with elevated cross-currency headwinds. The margin (up 90bp QoQ) was better than expected on account of lower employee costs, sub-contractor expenses, and operating leverage. The management indicated that attrition has peaked out and quarterly attrition should ease in the coming quarters. The supply situation easing out in 2HFY23 along with benefits from increased fresher additions in the last few quarters and lower sub-contractor costs should aid margins. However, we remain concerned about Q3 margin due to the timelines of cost optimization strategies. We expect the margin to improve in 2HFY23 and hit exit run-rate of ~25%. We expect FY23/24 margin to be at 24.1/24.8%.

Outlook

We have slightly tweaked our FY23/FY24 EPS. We expect a USD revenue CAGR of 8.1% over FY22-24 and INR EPS CAGR of 13% during the same period (aided by INR depreciation). Our TP of INR3,580 implies 27x FY24E EPS, with a 15% upside potential. We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock.

Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad had announced this on the company’s call with analysts on Monday, October 10 after it declared its results for the second quarter.

""The remaining 30 percent of employees will be paid [the variable pay] based on the business unit performance,” Lakkad said.

For Q1, TCS had said it did not delay variable payout to employees, and that it was fully paid out to all employees. In a statement in August, the company had said that the variable pay is paid either in the first or second month as per the normal process.

TCS’ peers Wipro and Infosys had both slashed variable pay for the first quarter. Wipro had held back variable payouts to mid and senior level employees and paid out 70 percent of the variable pay to junior employees. Infosys, on the other hand, had slashed average variable payout to 70 percent.

TCS hired 20,000 freshers in the July-September quarter, and onboarded a little over 35,000 freshers during the first half of the fiscal year. While its previously announced fresher hiring target for FY23 was 40,000, TCS said it expects to hire 10-12,000 more freshers. Lakkad said the company will decide on its new targets for fresher hiring after the third quarter.

He said that TCS has honoured all the job offers the company made.

The firm's attrition during the quarter inched up to 21.5 percent on an LTM basis, up from 19.7 percent sequentially.

“The technology job market which had overheated in the last few quarters has begun to cool off, and compensation expectations of new hires are also becoming more realistic. With supply catching up across the industry, the pressure to poach experienced talent is easing so we should start seeing the churn settling in the coming months,” Lakkad said.

Talking to media after sharing a healthy set of numbers for the September quarter, Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said TCS’s position on moonlighting was communicated to employees. No action has been taken so far against someone, he said.

It was codified in the company’s employment contract that employees weren’t allowed to work for any other organisation, Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan said.

IT professionals taking up a second job, thought to be made possible due to work from home, has polarised opinion, with most companies saying it was unacceptable.

TCS’ peers Infosys and Wipro have hit out against the practice. Infosys sent a warning email to employees, while Wipro Chairman Rishad Premji has said the company let go of 300 people working for competitors.

TCS in September directed employees to work from its offices for at least three days a week and said adherence to the company’s roster was mandatory.

Lakkad said all the company’s seniors were coming to office.

“The remaining staff we are rostering all of them, across projects. One-third of them are coming to office at least twice a week and the numbers will increase. There is excitement about coming to work,” he said.

In an email, the company told employees to return to office, warning that noncompliance would be taken seriously.

“Senior leaders of TCS have been working from TCS offices for a while now and our customers are also visiting TCS offices… Your respective managers will now roster you to work from the TCS office for at least 3 days in a week,” it read.

A TCS spokesperson earlier told Moneycontrol that all employees were asked to return to their base locations where they were operating before the coronavirus pandemic.

“Those employees who have sought and got transfers will operate from the changed locations,” the spokesperson said.

During the last quarter’s results, TCS had said 20 percent of the staff was working out of its offices.

Calling employees back to the office also comes at a time when TCS announced its 25/25 model, under which no more than 25 percent of its employees would be required to work out of its offices at any given time and no more than 25 percent of their time would be spent at the office.

While the decision to call employees back to office appears to run contrary to the 25/25 model, the company's leadership previously said the plan was to get employees back to work at regular levels, or at least to 80 percent, before implementing a structured hybrid model.

While speaking to the press, CEO Rajesh Gopinathan stated that there is an increasing sense of caution, that the environment is difficult, and that they must remain vigilant.

In terms of client spending, he said that they will learn about next year's budgets three to six months later.

Gopinathan added that the demand for services continues to be strong. ""Our order book is holding up well, with a healthy mix of growth and transformation initiatives, cloud migration, and outsourcing engagements,"" he said, adding that there is an increasing sense that they need to be wary of uncertainties.

He added that there were no mega deals during this quarter, and while they did secure a few deals in the range of $400 million, it was spread out across sectors.

COO NG Subramaniam said that demand is good across all geographies and verticals, but there is some softness that is to be expected, especially when it comes to long-term deals or decisions. In Europe, he said, a lot of people are thinking about how this winter will be, and it's safer to expect some softness.

Marks & Spencer, Zurich Insurance, Nokia, and Boots were among the key deals won this quarter.

Tata Consultancy Services, the country's largest IT services provider, came out with better than expected quarterly earnings scorecard for the quarter ended September, with profitability crossing the Rs 10,000-crore mark, backed by consistent demand in services.

The IT sector bucked trend in the falling markets, ahead of TCS earnings, with Nifty IT index rising 1 percent. The stock itself gained 1.75 percent.

Here are 10 key highlights from TCS' earnings:

1) Profit

The IT services company clocked consolidated bottomline at Rs 10,431 crore for the September FY23 quarter, a 10 percent growth over previous quarter (up 8.4 percent YoY), with profitable growth across verticals. According the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18, the profit was estimated at Rs 10,248 crore for the quarter.

""Demand for our services continues to be very strong. We registered strong, profitable growth across all our industry verticals and in all our major markets,"" said Rajesh Gopinathan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director.

2) Top Line

The consolidated revenue in rupee terms grew by 4.8 percent sequentially (up 18 percent YoY) to Rs 55,309 crore by the company, higher than CNBC-TV18 poll estimates that pegged it at Rs 54,905 crore for the said quarter, driven by strong execution.

""This was another quarter of excellent execution that saw us delivering several transformational projects like the largest migration of 2.3 million policies to TCS Insurance platform in one go in the UK, or the trading platform at the Gift City,"" said N Ganapathy Subramaniam, Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director.

Consolidated revenue in dollar terms increased by 1.4 percent quarter-on-quarter to $6,877 million and in constant currency, the growth was 4 percent for the September FY23 quarter (against 3.5 percent in Q1FY23), better than CNBC-TV18 poll estimates of 1.3 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively.

On a year-on-year basis, the revenue growth in constant currency was 15.4 percent.

3) Orderbook

The orderbook remained quite strong for yet another quarter at $8.1 billion for Q2FY23, though slightly down compared to $8.2 billion in previous quarter.

""Our order book is holding up well, with a healthy mix of growth and transformation initiatives, cloud migration and outsourcing engagements,"" Rajesh Gopinathan said.

As clients prepare for a more challenging environment ahead, technologies like cloud that have been embraced now have to be fully leveraged to realize the promised value, he added.

4) Growth Across Verticals

The Tata Group firm said the growth was broad-based across verticals, led by Retail & PCG that grew by 22.9 percent YoY in constant currency terms, and communications & media with 18.7 percent growth.

Technology & services vertical registered a 15.9 percent growth, and manufacturing as well as life sciences & healthcare verticals grew 14.5 percent, while BFSI reported 13.1 percent YoY growth in constant currency.

5) Regionwise Performance

Major markets like North America (up 17.6 percent YoY in constant currency), UK (up 14.8 percent) & Europe (up 14.1 percent) showed strong growth.

In emerging markets, India clocked 16.7 percent YoY growth, Latin America 19 percnet, Middle East & Africa 8.2 percent and Asia Pacific showed 7 percent increase compared to year-ago period.

6) Services

TCS said there was strong, broad-based growth for all services in Q2, led by cloud, enterprise application services, and cyber security.

The demand for cloud modernization services continued across all hyperscaler cloud services to drive scalability, reliability, and business transformations in all industry verticals, while the cloud ERP, customer experience, connected services and managed security are the themes that drove the growth in Q2, it added.

The company believes the demand for cybersecurity services continued to be robust as clients focus on protecting critical infrastructure; there is greater adoption of TCS Cyber Defence Suite for operations, monitoring, GRC and reporting.

There were multiple large deal wins for digital transformation of operations in data center and network, digital workspace, and customer experience. Areas which saw most growth in Q2 include digital financial & accounting, agile supply chain and human capital management services, TCS said.

7) Operating Performance

The operating performance for the September FY23 quarter, too, was better than analysts' estimates. Consolidated earnings before and tax (EBIT) in Q2FY23 grew by 9 percent sequentially to Rs 13,279 crore and margin expanded by 90 bps to 24 percent compared to previous quarter.

The CNBC-TV18 poll estimates for EBIT and margin were at Rs 13,079 crore and 23.8 percent for the quarter.

""We are steadily making our way towards achieving the operating margin priority for the year, aided by leverage from good growth, the flattening of the workforce pyramid, steadily improving productivity and currency support,"" said Samir Seksaria, Chief Financial Officer.

Very importantly, the headwinds from the supply-side challenges are abating, so that set up well for the seasonally weak second half of the year, he said.

8) Workforce

TCS reported net addition of 9,840 employees during the quarter, taking the workforce to 6.16 lakh as on September 2022, with women making up 35.7 percent of the base.

In Q2, ""TCSers clocked 11.7 million learning hours, resulting in the acquisition of 1.5 million competencies,"" the company said in its BSE filing.

9) Attrition

IT services attrition was 21.5 percent on the last twelve months' basis, which came in higher than 19.7 percent recorded in June FY23 quarter.

With normalizing wage expectations and talent supply catching up across the industry, the company expects attrition to start to taper down in second half of FY23.

""We believe the quarterly annualized attrition has peaked in Q2 and should see it taper down from this point, while compensation expectations of experienced professionals moderate,"" Milind Lakkad, Chief HR Officer said.

TCS' investments in capacity building and organic talent development have allowed it to substantially grow the business ahead of headcount addition this quarter, he added.

10) Dividend

The company said the board of directors on Monday declared a second interim dividend of Rs 8 per share.

The second interim dividend will be paid on November 7 to the equity shareholders, while the record date has been fixed as October 18 for determining the eligibility of shareholders for paying the dividend.",1060,0.8548325485196607

IT major Tata Consultancy Services onboarded 35,000 freshers during the first half of FY23, the company announced in its second quarter results on October 10. Of these, 20,000 freshers had been onboarded in Q2.

In comparison, the company had hired 43,000 freshers in the first half of FY22. During the full year, this number was over 1 lakh.

The company expects to hire 10-12,000 more freshers in FY23, but will decide on its new targets for fresher hiring post the third quarter.

TCS had announced a fresher hiring target of 40,000 for FY23 at the end of FY22.

The company's net addition for the quarter was 9,840 employees, taking its headcount to 6,16,171. This was a decline from the last quarter, when the company had a net addition of 14,136. In the same quarter last year, TCS’ net addition was 19,690 employees.

While the net addition had considerably increased in Q3 (28,238) and Q4 (35,209) last fiscal, it declined significantly in Q1FY23 (14,136).

Elevated attrition troubles of the sector were expected to continue by analysts, but with some moderation. Attrition in Q2FY23 came in at 21.5 percent on a last-twelve-month basis (LTM), up from 19.7 percent last quarter. In Q2FY22, TCS’ attrition was 11.9 percent.

Chief HR Officer Milind Lakkad said in a statement that TCS has honoured all job offers the company had made.

“Our investments in capacity building and organic talent development have allowed us to substantially grow our business ahead of headcount addition this quarter. We believe our quarterly annualized attrition has peaked in Q2 and should see it taper down from this point, while compensation expectations of experienced professionals moderate,” he said.

The company said it expects attrition to taper down in the second half of the fiscal year, with normalizing wage expectations and talent supply catching up across the industry.

For the quarter, ICICI Securities had forecast elevated attrition levels on a quarter-on-quarter basis for the sector, and expected higher onsite attrition. Analysts say attrition is expected to decline from the next quarter as demand subsides materially.",366,0.09528472026189168

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on October 10 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 10,465 crore for the quarter ended September 2022, registering an 8.41 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth from Rs 9,653 crore logged in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

Kicking off the earnings season for the information technology sector, the country's largest IT services provider said sequentially, the profit rose 9.93 percent.

TCS said the revenue from operations grew by 18.01 percent YoY to Rs 55,309 crore compared to Rs 46,867 crore in the same quarter last year. Sequentially, revenue grew 4.83 percent.

In constant currency terms, revenue growth was 15.4 percent YoY. The company said its operating margin came in at 24 percent, contracting 1.6 percent YoY. The company’s order book for the quarter was at $8.1 billion. Net cash from operations came in at Rs 10,675 crore or 102.3 percent of net income, the company said.

“Demand for our services continues to be very strong,” said Rajesh Gopinathan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, TCS. “We registered strong, profitable growth across all our industry verticals and in all our major markets. Our order book is holding up well, with a healthy mix of growth and transformation initiatives, cloud migration and outsourcing engagements.”

TCS also announced a dividend of Rs 8 per share. The record date for the same is October 18 and it will be paid on November 7.

“This was another quarter of excellent execution that saw us delivering several transformational projects like the largest migration of 2.3 million policies to our TCS Insurance platform in one go in the UK or the trading platform at the Gift City,"" said N Ganapathy Subramaniam, Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director, TCS.

Segment-wise, growth was led by Retail and CPG (22.9 percent), Communications & Media (18.7 percent), and Technology & Services (15.9 percent). Manufacturing as well as Life Sciences & Healthcare verticals grew 14.5 percent, while BFSI grew 13.1 percent.

Market-wise, North America led with 17.6 percent growth; Continental Europe grew 14.1 percent and the UK grew 14.8 percent. In emerging markets, India grew 16.7 percent, Latin America grew 19 percent, Middle East & Africa grew 8.2 percent and Asia Pacific grew 7 percent.

""We believe our quarterly annualized attrition has peaked in Q2 and should see it taper down from this point, while compensation expectations of experienced professionals moderate,” said Milind Lakkad, Chief HR Officer, TCS.

""We believe that IT Services would not remain immune to worsening global macros in terms of rising inflation, economic slowdown, currency headwinds and likely cut on spending,"" said Mitul Shah - Head of Research at Reliance Securities.

""Revenue growth would taper down to low double digit in FY24E, while QoQ decline in order book, clear lower employee addition, higher attrition and lower pricing power ahead would lead to valuation multiple contraction close to its historical averages. Therefore, at present we have SELL rating on TCS.""

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the country's largest IT services company, will take the lead, announcing its results on October 10, followed by Wipro and HCLTech on October 12, and Infosys on October 13.

Most of them had a strong total contract value (TCV) and demand pipeline last quarter, but a lot is expected to be revealed this quarter. Especially, addressing several supply-side problems, such as not hiring new people who had been given offer letters, variable pay cuts and delays, client spending budgets going down, etc.

TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan stated last quarter that he expects the demand pipeline to remain strong in Q2, but that he will be wary of the macro-environment. Since then, a lot has changed.

We look at the top five things to keep an eye out for:

Revenue growth

Despite macroeconomic uncertainties in Europe and the United States, their key markets, and impending recessionary pressures, TCS is expected to post similar revenue growth to the previous quarter. Analysts expect revenue will increase by 1.2-1.7 percent in USD terms and 3.5-3.8 percent in constant currency terms, reaching an estimated Rs. 54,766 crore.

Cross currency headwinds

The depreciation and volatility of the rupee are one of the main worries in the industry right now. The value of the British pound and the Euro has dropped by nearly 10 percent since the end of the previous quarter, with the yen and the Australian dollar making matters worse. Volatility in currency can significantly impact Q2 performance as well as Q3FY23E.

“For tier-1 IT, we are building CC growth moderation to 13 percent for FY23E (~400bps negative cross currency impact) and 10 percent CC growth for FY24E (~1% negative cross currency impact) as compared to 18 percent growth registered in FY22,” analysts at HDFC Securities said in their report.

Demand remains resilient

Despite the macro challenges in Europe, TCS' contracting activity was strong, with some of the key deals including Marks & Spencer, Nokia, Boots, Zurich Insurance, and, according to media reports, a $2-billion BSNL deal.

However, Gopinathan's comments on client spending trends and demand expectations for the coming quarters will be worth noting. Especially since the retail industry and the BFSI sector - two of TCS's strongest segments - have been particularly hit and have experienced a slowdown in recent months.

Fresher hiring

The last quarter saw the IT sector's strong hiring narrative starting to crumble. TCS had already reported a slowdown in new hires in the first quarter of FY23, with around 14,000 compared to 24,000 in the same quarter last year and 35,209 in Q4FY22. The company then stated that it is now working to increase its utilisation rates.

However, despite offer letters being rolled out at major companies such as Wipro, Infosys, and Tech Mahindra, fresher onboarding has been delayed for months, and in some cases offers have been revoked, indicating an increasingly difficult business environment and an attempt to cut costs.

Meanwhile, variable pay was also either delayed or partially reduced for companies such as TCS, Wipro, and Infosys.

US visa crisis

Indians currently account for nearly 75 percent of all H-1B visas issued each year. The specialised non-immigrant visa allows employers to bring in technically skilled workers from other countries. Given the sheer volume of requests and the two years of uncertainty and travel restrictions caused by the pandemic, the visa approval timeline has now increased by over 400 days, and in some cases by 800 days.

This makes it difficult for IT companies to send employees to sites overseas. Analysts told Moneycontrol that this will keep subcontracting costs high in the near-term, at least until Q3.

Last quarter, TCS chief financial officer, Samir Seksaria, said, “Our subcontractor expenses currently are at 9.7% of our revenues, and have moved up from about 7% levels to where we are currently. And as Rajesh pointed out, we have proactively and strategically invested in creating a bench. Our current priorities are to stay focused on capturing the demand. And we have known how to balance on the subcontractor side. And as the need arises, we'll be able to realign it or balance it.”

The company will be in focus ahead of September FY23 quarter earnings.

With expectations of a ‘resilient’ quarterly performance from IT companies, bellwether Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is all set to kick start Q2FY23 earnings season on October 10.

Consolidated profit after tax (PAT) for TCS may jump 5.4 percent on a yearly basis to Rs 10,151 crore in the second quarter of FY23 (July-September) while consolidated revenue is expected to increase 17.2 percent to Rs 54,949 crore, according to an average of estimates of five brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.

The company had recorded a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,624 crore during the corresponding period of last financial year when its consolidated revenues stood at Rs 46,867 crore. TCS had registered a PAT of Rs 9,478 crore during April to June 2022 period on revenue of Rs 52,758 crore.

Key growth drivers

Analysts believe strong deal execution and robust contracting activity augurs well for the company. “Despite the macro challenges in Europe, contracting activity remains strong for TCS, with the likes of M&S, Boots, Nokia and Zurich Insurance,” HDFC Securities noted.

In rupee terms, revenue is expected to increase 4.1 percent quarter on quarter (QoQ) aided by rupee depreciation. The bluechip company is expected to register 3.5 percent QoQ growth in constant currency terms. “This will be led by continued improvement in demand from BFSI, healthcare and retail, acceleration in digital technologies, and ramp-up of deals,” said ICICI Securities.

Meanwhile, cross-currency headwinds of 220 basis points QoQ and 540 bps year on year (YoY) will be extremely high and this may impact dollar revenue, which has been estimated at $6,886 million.

When it comes to TCV (total contract value), Kotak Institutional Equities expects moderate growth on a yearly basis. “We see the number to be in the range of $8-8.5 billion,” they said in a note.

Margins

EBIT margin for the company is set to improve by about 50 bps on a sequential basis to 23.6 percent, as analysts believe wage pressure is now behind the company. Global brokerage Jefferies says margin expansion will be highest for TCS in the IT pack, driven by pyramiding, operating leverage and pricing benefit, amidst continued pickup in travel/discretionary expenses and supply-side pressures.

ICICI Securities believes wage hike impact has already been factored in Q1 on continued high attrition pushing higher backfilling expenses as well as higher subcontractor costs.

Both Jefferies and ICICI Securities have worked out EBIT margin of 23.6 percent while Elara pegs it at 23.5 percent.

Things to watch out for

Investors will be closely watching the management’s comments on demand trends in key verticals like BFSI and retail CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods). Margin outlook for FY23, deal pipeline, pricing scenario, attrition rate and client spends in the US and Europe are other key monitorables.

Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities will also be tracking furloughs in the coming quarter. “The focus on furloughs for the December 2022 quarter will be high. The industry escaped this impact in the last two years due to aggressive client spending and large deal ramp-up,” they said.

On October 10, the Board will also consider declaration of second interim dividend to equity shareholders. That’s another thing investors will have an eye on.

Bearing the brunt of FII selling in the first half of the year, TCS has declined 20 percent in 2022 so far. It hit a 52-week low of Rs 2926 on September 26th. Ahead of earnings, the stock is trading in the red.

Despite all the talks of slowdown in demand from the US and European countries, analysts expect IT companies to deliver a 'resilient' quarterly performance with 2-4 percent sequential growth in revenues.

“The IT sector is expected to post resilient Q2 performance in context of the current macro environment. Tier-1 IT companies are expected to deliver sequential growth in the range of 2.4 to 4 percent constant currency,” said analysts at HDFC Securities in a note.

The brokerage added that mid tier companies will continue their outperformance over larger peers with Tata Elxsi, Mindtree and Persistent Systems expected to lead at above mid single digit quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth.

Others brokerages also have similar expectations. Elara Capital outlines average 3.8 percent QoQ growth and Jefferies has predicted a 3.6 percent jump. Antique Stock Broking expects revenue growth in the range of 2-4 percent QoQ in organic constant currency terms for top 5 and 3-5 percent for mid-caps.

According to analysis of most of the brokerages, falling margins of IT firms may have bottomed now. IT sector margins have contracted 400 bps since post-Covid peak levels.

“We’re building margin at 100 bps lower than pre-covid for FY23 and some recovery in FY24 (to around pre-Covid levels) supported by medium term tailwinds of normalisation in attrition, utilisation and pricing,” said HDFC Securities. Jefferies also expects aggregate EBIT margins to recover slightly by 30 bps QoQ in Q2FY23 after falling by 165 bps in Q1FY23.

Also read: Global IT slowdown signals Indian tech’s fall from grace

IT companies have taken many steps recently to arrest the fall in their margins, including holding back variables for employees. Nonetheless, analysts said wage impact and cross currency impact will impact margin in Q2, offset by absence of visa cost, INR depreciation, improved utilisation and efficiencies.

Slowdown impactThe growth rate for IT companies have slowed down following the boom in revenue during the pandemic. It is expected to go further down as western economies reel under the aftermath of war in Ukraine.

Though the management at top IT companies have maintained that the growth will note be impacted much due to recessionary pressure in Europe and the US, analysts have already started trimming down their expectations beyonds September quarter (Q2).

“Expect the disconnect between weak macro and tech leaders’ commentary to narrow down, with outlook turning soft hereon. We do not anticipate guidance upgrades from Infosys, HCLT and Coforge,” said Elara Capital.

Currency impact

The bygone quarter was marked by sharp depreciation in rupee against the US dollar, which is generally considered positive for export oriented IT companies. However, depreciating euro and pound have also become worries for the sector.

Jefferies said currency headwinds will impact US dollar revenue growth. “Given the 5-7 percent depreciation of GBP & EUR against USD, revenue growth in USD terms for our coverage universe will be impacted by 165 bps in Q2FY23, slightly lower than the 185 bps impact in the last quarter,” it said.

It is expected that companies with higher exposure to GBP and EUR like Coforge, Tech Mahindra and TCS are likely to be impacted more due to the forex rate change. L&T Infotech, Mindtree and Infosys seem better placed in this regard, with cross-currency impact on revenue growth being nearly half of the previously mentioned companies.

Things to watch

The most important factor right now is management commentary on the demand environment. Any negativity shown by them will be taken into account and may hurt share prices, which are already trading at 30-40 percent discount to their 52-week high prices.

Commentary around deal pipeline, sales cycle, nature of deals and deal tenure, pricing, and vendor consolidation will also be keenly watched. Analysts and investors will also focus on any cues on client budgets or reprioritization of client spends.

Supply-side and attrition trends, hedging policies in the midst of sharp currency depreciation will be other key things to monitor.

Wipro has called people back to its offices three days a week, and has informed its India employees that its campuses will be open for four days a week from October 10.

Those in leadership roles at the company will work out of offices three times a week, Wipro said in a statement to Moneycontrol.

“Starting October 10, Wipro's offices in India will be open Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. We will not be open on Wednesdays,” the email sent by Wipro to employees states.

The email says it encourages employees to work from office on at least three of these four days.

“This will help us enjoy the camaraderie and team spirit of connecting in person while maintaining hybrid work flexibility,” the email read.

In its statement, Wipro said it has adopted a flexible and hybrid approach in its return-to-work policy.

""Our carefully deliberated back-to-office policy is meant to allow employees the flexibility of remote work while ensuring that our teams can access experiences as well as opportunities and build meaningful relationships at work,"" Wipro said in a statement.

India Inc has been putting in place plans to get employees back to offices, and Wipro's announcement comes after Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) told employees to start working from the office three days a week. All TCS employees were told to return to the base locations where they were operating before the pandemic.

TCS had said that rostering will be done based on project requirements and will include a mix of freshers and experienced professionals.

Wipro has been in the eye of the storm over moonlighting after Chairman Rishad Premji said that the company fired 300 employees who were found to be working directly for one of their competitors.

While experts have said that moonlighting increased during the pandemic as employees were allowed to work from home and managers couldn't look over their shoulder, a nudge to return to work could suggest that this may be coming to an end.

In the high-profile WhatsApp case, Sebi has dismissed insider trading charges against individuals, who circulated alleged unpublished price-sensitive information about the financial results of certain companies, including TCS and Ultratech Cement.

Those individuals are — Shailendra Mehta, Aditya Omprakash Gaggar, Shruti Vishal Vora and Neeraj Kumar Agarwal, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in five separate orders. The latest orders came after the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) had set aside Sebi’s insider trading charges against certain individuals in the WhatsApp leak case in March 2021 and the same was upheld by the Supreme Court on September 26 this year.

The case pertains to the circulation of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI) in various private WhatsApp groups about five companies — Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Ultratech Cement, Bata India, Tata Chemicals and Mindtree — ahead of their official announcements to the stock exchanges.

It was alleged that Mehta circulated UPSI-related financial earnings of Bata India, Ultratech Cement and Mindtree to others through Whatsapp messages. Also, Gaggar and Agarwal were accused of similar violations in the case of Tata Chemicals and TCS, respectively. In addition, Vora allegedly communicated the financial earnings of TCS and Ultratech Cement to others.

It was alleged that these four persons violated Sebi’s regulations that prohibit insider trading activities. Now, in its orders passed on Thursday, Sebi has disposed of insider trading charges against the four individuals.

Dismissing the charges against these four persons, Sebi said the instant case is a replica of the case that was decided by SAT in March 2021 and upheld by the Supreme Court its order passed on September 26, 2022, with the only difference that the circulation of WhatsApp messages pertain to different scrips.

In its order, SAT had noted the definitions of unpublished price sensitive information and insider information and had said that generally, available information would not be a UPSI. It further, said that the information can be branded as a UPSI only when the person getting the information had knowledge that it was a UPSI.

In 2017, some news reports referred to the circulation of UPSI in various private WhatsApp groups about certain companies ahead of their official announcements to the respective stock exchanges.

Citing people with knowledge of the development, the report said that the two companies have bridged their differences over pricing and other commercial terms.

The deal paves the way for the Tata group–led consortium to emerge as India’s first indigenous telecom network solutions provider.

Tejas Networks, a unit of Tata Sons, is expected to locally manufacture the network equipment for BSNL.

BSNL’s 4G services are expected to be rolled out across 100,000 towers or sites, the report added.

In late July, the Union Cabinet approved a Rs 1.64 lakh crore revival package for BSNL, which includes cash support of Rs 43,964 crore and non-cash support of Rs 1.20 lakh crore.

The package has three main elements - improving the quality of BSNL services, de-stressing the balance sheet, and expanding the fibre reach through merger with Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL).

""To improve existing services and provide 4G services, BSNL will be allotted spectrum in 900/1800 MHz band administratively at the cost of Rs 44,993 crore through equity infusion. With this spectrum, BSNL will be able to compete in the market and provide high speed data using their vast network including in rural areas,"" the telecom ministry said.

In a developing economy, moonlighting is a phase. According to a senior executive of Heidrick & Struggles (H&S), such trends were also observed in China in the early 2000s. The global firm provides senior-level executive search, culture shaping, and leadership consulting services.

More than 70 percent of Fortune 1000 firms, including those in the healthcare, financial services, technology, industrial, and consumer sectors, are clients of H&S. Its two major sectors are technology and financial services.

Moonlighting has recently become a hot topic in India's information technology (IT) and technology industries. Most recently, Wipro Chairman Rishad Premji revealed that the IT giant discovered 300 of its employees moonlighting for direct competitors over the past few months.

Moonlighting refers to employees having a second job, typically in secret, in addition to their regular employment.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, David Hui, Regional Managing Partner, Industrial Practice, APAC and Middle East, H&S, said, “It’s funny. When I landed in Mumbai and on the way from the airport to the hotel, I was talking to one of my colleagues and saying that being back here reminds me of China in the early 2000s, the same growth, all of that.”

""I recall moonlighting and other such activities being fairly widespread in China in the early 2000s,"" he continued. ""I believe it's just a phase that economies and people have, and part of it is just the cost of living, which makes them (employees) feel like they need to earn more money. Also, there's an appetite to learn more and we see it less obviously on the industrial side, but I'm sure in tech and everywhere else in the world, these are common issues.”

Although commitment and loyalty are the fundamental issues, according to Hui, the technology sector is nevertheless far more prone to dispute, IP theft, and trade secret leaks.

“May be it's an old-school idea of commitment. You work for us, you work with us, and we expect you to not be working for someone else. It's the question of commitment, loyalty, and also conflict. To be honest, I think on the technology industry side, people are much more nervous about conflict, leakage of trade secrets, and things like that. So I think that generally workforces in technology are much more transient than they are in other sectors,” he said.

Return to work

Recently, the world's largest provider of IT services, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), ordered its staff to spend at least three days a week working from the office. In the meantime, other businesses are aiming to go in that direction.

“In some markets people are flooding back to the office. They want that connectivity and want to get together. It's a function of living conditions as well. In Hong Kong, for example, people seem to want to come back to the office, not everyone wants to work at home, because flat sizes are small. So you come to the office and have some space.""

``But in other places like in India, in Mumbai, people don't mind staying at home because they want to avoid the commute. So it is very much dependent on the local and individual context. I think the companies just have to accept moonlighting. Not doing so is not practical,” he said.",553,-0.9979543685913086

So far in 2022, the Nifty IT has fallen 27 percent while the sectoral gauge is down 22 percent in six months.

IT stocks had taken a severe beating, factoring in the aggressive tone of United States Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Symposium in Wyoming. After a rebound, they resumed their fall on September 14, reacting to the hotter-than-expected inflation data released in the US, which many said signals a more hawkish Fed. With that, the Nifty IT index tumbled 4 percent.

Surprisingly, JPMorgan has also recently downgraded its rating on all technology stocks in its portfolio citing continued margin pressure. Here’s what has been causing rout in IT stocks:

What was Powell’s speech about at Jackson Hole?

Powell said the US central bank would continue raising interest rates in a way that will cause “some pain” to the US economy.

Despite four consecutive hikes in interest rates totalling to 2.25 percentage points, Powell believes this is “no place to stop or pause” even if benchmark rates are near an area that is considered neither stimulative nor restrictive to growth.

The Fed chair explained that higher interest rates will bring down inflation but they will also cause some pain to households and businesses. “These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain,” he said.

What was the inflation reading in the US and what does it imply?

The US Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on September 13 showed that August CPI increased at an annual pace of 8.3 percent, more than economists’ median estimate of 8.1 percent.

This hotter-than-expected reading led to a perception that there will be an even more aggressive monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve next week in its policy meeting, cementing bets of a large 75-basis-point interest rate hike.

How does Powell’s speech and higher inflation affect Indian IT companies?

Outlook for the US and Europe is important for Indian IT companies as the bulk of their revenues come from these markets.

The US and Europe together contributed around 86 percent to Indian IT firms’ revenues in FY22, ratings agency CRISIL recently highlighted.

Powell’s remarks and the higher-than-anticipated inflation print have stoked recession fears, which would mean a cutting back on IT spending by American and European corporates, which in turn would hit earnings growth of Indian IT companies.

According to analysts, North America contributes 61 percent to Infosys’ revenue and Europe 25 percent. North America and Latin America form 55 percent of revenues for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) while the UK and continental Europe constitute 30 percent. For Wipro, 60 percent of sales comes from the US and 28 percent from Europe.

How have IT stocks performed lately?

Shares of Infosys, TCS, Tech Mahindra and Wipro have slumped 16-42 percent in 2022 so far.

What is the outlook for the sector?

With the Indian IT sector already trading at 28 times its one-year forward P/E compared to its past 10-year P/E of 18 times, ICICI Securities believes much of the growth and earnings expectations over the next three years are factored into the share prices. Hence, the brokerage firm is cautiously optimistic after a three-year-long bullish stance on the sector.

JPMorgan on its part believes margins of IT companies will continue to take a hit in the medium term. It has turned more bearish on the sector.

CRISIL said resumption of travel and rising cost of hiring at a time of high attrition will moderate operating margins to the pre-pandemic level of about 23 percent this fiscal. Significant cost savings had driven margins to a peak of 26 percent in fiscal 2021, which then moderated to around 24 percent last fiscal.

Nomura has retained its cautious view on the sector. It sees more evidence of revenue slowdown ahead in the sector and added that slowing revenue and high inflation will likely dampen IT budgets.",669,-0.653562511006991

The worst of the commodity price spike the world experienced in the first six months of 2022 is behind us, says Sandeep Bhatia, the Head of Equity and Country Head-India at Macquarie Group.

Prices of oil and other commodities had surged in the lead-up to and the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, but have since eased.

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Bhatia shared his views on the current market rally and spoke about the Information Technology (IT) sector, future of electric vehicles and the scope offered by the country’s defence sector.

The National Stock Exchange (NSE) benchmark Nifty50 on Tuesday closed above the psychological level of 18,000 points. ""Diwali has come a month early in the markets,"" Bhatia said.

He added: ""We’ll probably go into the third quarter of this financial year or fourth quarter of this current year quite strong. The market has legs to it.""

The only disappointment, according to Bhatia, has been a ""sort of weak monsoon"".

Moving on, he spoke about broader industrial consumption trends which ""are still holding up."" He expects the market to rise by another 8-10 percent in the next three to four months.

According to him, in the first quarter of next year, with the budget around the corner, there is a possibility of investors booking profits.

Verdict on large cap IT names

""We like the IT sector. We like HCL Tech, TCS, Infosys, so we definitely like that. Our call here is that we’ll continue to see decent earnings growth -- 10 to 12 percent earnings growth,"" Bhatia said.

Given negativity around the IT sector because of expectations of a recession in the US and European Union, Bhatia said ""we are seeing a lot of pushback.""

He added: ""US will not have as big and as deep a recession as we have seen in the previous cycle. So to that extent, the IT sector offers very good value at current levels.""

Operational pressure

Apart from US recession concerns, there exist worries over large companies such as Infosys and HCL Technologies, which are seeing margins at multi-quarter lows for the past 10-12 quarters.

Bhatia said there could be some negative news flow from the US, but even so India was not witnessing the kind of big layoffs that 2008 saw.

""I don’t think that the economy at least in the US will take such a big hit. I think the real challenge will be in Europe, not as much in US. At least on the entire balance between valuations, earnings, and growth, the IT sector stands out.""

Electric Vehicles

In the automobile industry, companies like Mahindra & Mahindra are making big investments in manufacturing Electric Vehicles (EVs). They are investing Rs 9,000-10,000 crore over the next couple of years in EVs.

Bhatia said the automobile industry and the EV space was worth looking at.

He added: ""I would still go with the large players, which are essentially Maruti, Tata Motors and Mahindra. Mahindra is being a standout because its product cycle has surprised both in terms of consumer response and the fact that the slew of products that have been launched have clearly upped the game in terms of product quality that M&M used to come out with.""

He picked Mahindra as the ""dark horse"" in the auto sector.

Bhatia expects Tata Motors and Mahindra to dominate the EV market over the next couple of years.

Defence sector

The defence sector is difficult to predict because it's lumpy and largely ""project and government-policy based,"" Bhatia said.

Structurally, the sector is headed in the direction of Make in India and on the defence front, some major platforms will see Indian corporate sectors come in and start contributing.

""Although if you want to look at it given the entire cycle of defence purchases in India, these will take five plus years if not more,"" he observed.

While it's worth keeping an eye on, ""I don't think you can deploy big sums of money or build any kind of big earnings projections which can be valid and credible in next 2-3 years,"" Bhatia said.",684,-0.40252373218536375

Visuals of water-logged roads, citizens being rescued on boats and tractors, and employees stuck on a foot-over-bridge outside one of the city’s tech parks are feeding into this debate. Representatives of IT companies and industry bodies also met state IT minister Ashwath Narayan, who has promised to resolve issues by next year's monsoons.

For now, Wipro and TCS, among others, have given employees the option of working from home.

""All our associates at Bengaluru are safe. We are closely monitoring the situation and our delivery teams have been advised to exercise due caution,"" a TCS spokesperson said.

Experts say that come rain or shine, hybrid work — a mix of WFH and office — will continue.

Rituparna Chakraborty, founder, Teamlease Services, said the situation in Bengaluru is not likely to have any larger impact. A similar situation had happened in 2019 as well, she said.

Hybrid work the new reality

Harshvendra Soin, global chief people officer and head-marketing, Tech Mahindra, told Moneycontrol that employee well-being is a priority, and associates continue to have the flexibility to work from anywhere. “We expect this trend of hybrid working to ramp up,” he said.

Infosys HR head and EVP Richard Lobo told Moneycontrol the future of work is hybrid, and the company’s approach to return to work is balanced with “a focus on employee well-being and business continuity.”

“Through the use of technology, we would like to build on our experience over the past couple of years to offer our employees more freedom around when to work and where, as well as a wider choice of options around work facilities and teams,” he said, adding that the hybrid model being envisioned by Infosys enables wider access to talent.

“I believe a hybrid work environment — seamlessly working from home and office — will be the new reality, and Infosys is prepared for this, as well as ready to help our employees prepare for it. We recognise that it takes a bit of time to get used to the new way of doing things, but it’s the future,” he said.

Queries sent to L&T Infotech, HCL Technologies and Accenture didn't elicit responses at the time of publication.

Return to work will continue

One of the factors believed to hinder employees' willingness to return to work is shoddy infrastructure in larger cities such as Bengaluru, as it adds to the woes of the daily commute and other difficulties.

Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO, CIEL HR Services, says that incidents such as the recent floods in Bengaluru and other infrastructure-related problems can deter people from coming to work. They would rather remain in their hometowns and enjoy a better standard of living.

On the other hand, Teamlease's Chakraborty says the reasons for returning to work go beyond issues with commute.

“There is a huge case to be made in terms of why being in office, around your colleagues, your team, matters for your mental health, builds social capital, and improves the quality of engagement and ideation,” she said.

She added that people may have their own reasons for choosing to go back to the office. For instance, some people may not have the luxury of working from home.

Returning to office is a welcome change, but people want the flexibility of choosing when to go in. “There are some who want to permanently work from home, but more and more want to go to the office a few days of the week,” she said.

In fact, she explained that companies prefer senior leadership to be in office, because it is an important signal. “Most leaders also prefer to be in office,” she added.

CIEL's Mishra believes the future is going to be a mix of people who will be completely working remotely, some who will come to office some days of the week, and some who will be happy to come to office every day.

With employees preferring a hybrid work arrangement, the manager needs to have the skills required to manage a team remotely, Mishra said.

“The solution is to train your managers to manage a remote team. The solution is not to force everybody to come to the office and make them commute two hours. You will lose people if you do that,” he said.

Infrastructure woes

K. S. Viswanathan, VP, Industry Initiatives, National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), who was among the people who met the IT minister to discuss the industry’s issues, told Moneycontrol that while only 30 percent of employees are returning to office, more would like to. The rains have had no impact on this, he said.

“Many people, especially youngsters, freshers joining the workforce, want to come to office,"" Vishwanathan said, adding that while the infrastructure has not been able to keep pace with the city’s exponential growth, the city was now augmenting the infrastructure, like the metro, roads, public transport, etc.

Narayan chaired the meeting along with Axilor Ventures head and Karnataka Vision Group for IT chairman Kris Gopalakrishnan.

The industry representatives told the government that their primary concern was to bring the issues they were facing to the government’s notice.

The meeting was attended by representatives of companies including Infosys, Mphasis, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Wipro, Intel and Accenture, along with representatives of industry body NASSCOM and the Outer Ring Road Companies Association (ORRCA), which counts major IT and banking companies among its members.

ORRCA, a body for companies on the Outer Ring Road, had earlier in a representation to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said companies would have to find alternative destinations if the city’s infrastructure issues was not improved.

In a statement, ORRCA said the meeting was constructive and that the government had reassured them that infrastructure challenges would be addressed with robust short, medium and long-term plans.

“There was general agreement that the ORR stretch needs to be prioritised and the government has taken feedback provided in a positive manner. A meeting to share and discuss the implementation plan is expected to happen shortly,” the statement said.

The Information Technology (IT) services and software services sectors reported 23 percent drop in active job openings volume in August 2022, as compared to the same month in August 2021, according to a report by staffing firm Xpheno. This comes at a time when Indian IT companies are already facing challenges and delays in rolling out quarterly variable pay to the employees amidst margin pressures.

On a month-on-month basis as compared to July 2022, IT Services and Software Service sectors registered 5 percent and 7 percent drop in job opening volumes respectively, according to the report. The IT Sector Collective of Services, Products and Internet enabled sectors, listed 165K jobs in August 2022, as against 172K in July 2022. On a MoM basis, the IT Sector collective registered a 4 percent drop in volume over June 2022.

In fact, the IT sector which is known to contribute the highest number of openings, saw an overall drop to 63 percent against the 80 percent plus range it has maintained over the last year, according to the report. This 63 percent is also the lowest contribution that the tech sector has recorded over the last 30 months.

This has primarily been on the account of margin pressures due to an impending recession in key markets like the US, inflation and a need to improve utilisation rate after a year of record hiring in 2021.

“The JAS (July, August and September) quarter is emerging a critical quarter in the COVID linked history of recruitment in India. The quarter is well set to be the corrective quarter for an otherwise hyperactive hiring funnel. With a controlled rate of drop in action, the quarter is set to be the stabilizer on an overheated talent graph in IT sector,” said Anil Ethanur, Co-Founder, Xpheno.

He added, “The slowdown in hiring action will be in favour of employers tackling unusually high attrition rates and unreasonable wage wars out in the market. With lesser jobs now chasing talent, recruitment conversations are now shifting in favor of the employer once again, after over a year of operating in a candidate-controlled market.”

The top 4 IT Service Bellwethers have been seeing steady growth in subcon costs over 8 quarters, the report said.

Across the top 3 IT companies TCS, Infosys and Wipro, employees have either seen deferring or partially cutting down on variable pay. Wipro had held back variable payments for mid- to senior-level employees for the April-June quarter. Meanwhile, Infosys on an average is paying around 70 percent variable amount on an average.

Wonder why your bank's system is down quite often or why you face transaction declines repeatedly?

A Moneycontrol investigation into tech glitches reported by Indian banks across multiple platforms — mobile and internet — over the last few years has revealed major fundamental problems in their operations.

For one, most banks, including bigger ones, continue to use outdated technology platforms, making upgrades difficult. Secondly, these banks severely lack the adequate number of talented tech professionals to support large-scale tech-enabled banking operations, often resulting in major delays in the event of an outage.

Moneycontrol studied the tech outages reported by at least six banks in the recent past and spoke to at least 10 officials from these banks and technology firms.

Rising customer complaints

According to the central bank’s 2021 ombudsman scheme annual report, customers submitted a total of 44,385 complaints related to mobile and electronic banking between April 2020 and March 2021, higher than the 41,310 complaints recorded by the regulator in the previous year.

This is at a time when banks continue to launch new digital initiatives and so-called super apps.

To give an example, on June 30, a Twitter user posted a “maintenance” break screenshot from State Bank of India’s (SBI) banking application YONO. He complained that the bank had shared no communication with customers to alert them of the service outage.

As per the screenshot, the app’s services were not supposed to be available till 7 pm on June 30.

“19:00 hours already passed…,” Verma replied to his original tweet after the maintenance break passed its deadline. The same day saw many similar complaints by users saying that India’s largest public sector bank had not sent any prior notice for the scheduled break at a time when the country is pushing for further digitisation.

SBI is not the only one facing heat for such issues. On August 17, multiple Twitter users posted complaints of not being able to log into the bank website or app of India’s largest private sector bank – HDFC Bank. Similarly on August 13, many complained that net banking was not working since morning that day.



@HDFC_Bank your netbanking site not working from today morning, please check and resolve the problem

— Satish Kumar (@SatishKRoy1976) August 13, 2022

“@HDFC_Bank your netbanking is down since an hour. I have payments to make and your site is just not working. Is it down for maintenance? If yes, no email or messages or any prior intimation was given to me,” tweeted user Ishita Shah.

Last year, the bank faced the wrath of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) after five major outages between November 2018 and March 2021. While RBI lifted the ban on all launches of its upcoming digital business-generating activities later, RBI’s diktat set the bank behind in competing with its peer ICICI Bank in credit card issuances as well as new digital initiatives.

Both SBI and HDFC Bank did not respond to detailed queries by Moneycontrol on the scheduled maintenance break or on the service outage.

Twitter is full of similar complaints across banks -- multiple users facing problems at once on some days.

What is the core issue?

The biggest strength of India’s largest banks is also the biggest Achilles' heel when it comes to technology – scale. Besides the burden on internal tech systems to handle the rising volumes of digital transactions, these are legacy systems with a heavy dependence on external service providers that plug in each layer of tech for banks.

“The large banks have the issue of using legacy technology from years ago. The bigger you are, the more difficult it is to upgrade. The risk is immense even while migrating from a large old database to a new one,” said the technology head of a leading fintech.

The core banking system of most banks is provided by large information technology players, including Infosys’ Finacle, Oracle and BaNCS by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). With the core system being operated by tech teams of these IT giants, internal teams of most banks only ensure that these systems are kept up and running.

“In one of our conversations with a smaller private bank that positioned itself as a digital bank, we were told that they have a tech team of 400 people. But not a single one of them wrote any code. Their entire job was to deal with their IT vendors,” the person added.

In such a situation, many experts believe that internal bank teams are largely deployed for ‘requirement management’ and not equipped to fix larger issues or build for evolving needs of customers.

Legacy problems

Aishwarya Jaishankar, who has led digital initiatives at various private sector banks and is now Co-Founder of Hyperface which provides tech stack for credit cards, said, “The core banking systems were built for the back offices and branches of banks and have scaled from there. But now modern customers want to be served digitally, needing a front-end focussed experience that banks are struggling to create with pure-play core banking systems.”

The core banking systems too are legacy software built over the past two decades and have reached a scale that makes it difficult to upgrade these to handle the increasing volumes. Hence, the knowledge required to operate these systems too is similar to what was required years ago.

Harshavardhan Godugula, Partner, Forensic and Integrity Services, EY, said, “Traditionally, core banking platforms are centralised systems – on top of which banks have built newer applications and capabilities, such as mobile banking, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), etc. Sometimes, these legacy systems are unable to perform adequately and face system downtime, vulnerabilities, hardware failures, etc. If banking apps are not built and tested properly, they are bound to throw back errors.”

Another disadvantage for large legacy banks is the difficulty in attracting the right talent and pay disparity as compared to large IT players and startups. “Large financial institutions have a hierarchical structure that makes decision-making difficult,” said another fintech founder.

Hyperface’s Jaishankar added, “While core banking is resilient, it has not evolved at the rate that innovation has taken place. Banks have to plug more third-party switches into the existing systems as the usage of real-time payments and other innovations increase pressure on the system.”

Nilufer Mullanfiroze, who has over two decades of experience working with banks like Standard Chartered and Federal Bank and is now Head of Banking at investment startup Groww argued that the time for technology to become redundant is only becoming shorter. Hence, it is not practical to expect large institutions to redo their systems.

""But what needs to be the practical approach with most banks is to have the right infrastructure to build things on top of their core banking systems. Having the agility to be able to use the core banking system more as the backend system and build the right interfaces with newer age technology is the way to go for the future,"" she added.

The tide, however, has changed for the better after the regulator took cognisance of major outages across banks. Top management across banks are now more aware of the limitations of their technical capacities and seem to be working with the regulator around challenges.

Finally, the UPI hiccup…

“Since the last few days, when we try to send or receive money through UPI apps, the SBI server is down very often. Nowadays, people carry very less cash in hand. How are we supposed to transact seamlessly in such a scenario,” Sanket Rathi, an SBI customer for more than 10 years told Moneycontrol.

Failures on UPI payment systems are basically of two types, technical decline (TD) and business decline (BD). Technical declines are caused due to issues with the bank's system or NPCI systems, while business declines are caused due to issues pertaining to customers, such as incorrect PINs or transactions beyond stipulated limits.

“If we compare TDs to BDs, the former is always lesser than the latter. This is a clear result of seamlessness,” Venkatraman Venkateswaran, chief financial officer (CFO) at Federal Bank said.

To counter issues relating to reconciliation of timed out and declined transactions on the UPI platform, we might soon see the emergence of a tech that will allow real-time settlement of such transactions, he added.

Numbers don’t lie

The top five UPI remitter banks in terms of volumes in July were SBI, HDFC Bank, Bank of Baroda, Union Bank and ICICI Bank. For example, SBI's approval rate of UPI transactions was at 92.1 percent in July. The bank’s business decline rate stood at 7.26 percent as compared to 6.96 percent in June. The technical decline rate saw a steep drop to 0.68 percent in July from over 5 percent in June.

While the decline rates keep fluctuating every month, for the user dependent on UPI for all transactions, this is a major road bump. So why do UPI downtimes happen with banks?

Banks as well as the RBI have taken cognisance of the burden that the rise in UPI transactions has put on bank servers. Since the pandemic struck in March 2020, UPI monthly transaction values have grown by 5x from Rs 2 lakh crore to Rs 10.62 lakh crore in July 2022. What’s more is that UPI is used for multiple small-ticket transactions, including paying for an auto ride or even your local tea stall owner.

With over 600 crore transactions a month, the stress on bank servers is high.

“To add to that, the innovation is happening faster than the time banks can take to handle the growing transactions. With RuPay credit cards on UPI and UPI 123Pay, the number of transactions is expected to grow significantly,” said a senior executive of a payments company.

So, what are banks doing to address these problems?

Large banks are working towards pre-empting the problems that may emerge in the coming years as digital adoption increases further.

“While other private banks are trying to get their house in order, ICICI Bank is preparing for a wider presence in getting embedded across a large number of platforms where users transact. It is also preparing to scale horizontally and vertically,” said the founder of a fintech and bank infrastructure provider.

ICICI Bank did not respond to Moneycontrol’s request to participate in the story.

HDFC Bank chief executive officer Sashidhar Jagdishan, in a mail to employees in April 2021, had said that the bank has invested heavily in scaling up the infrastructure to handle any potential load that it will encounter for the next three to five years.

The bank is also setting up a digital factory and an enterprise factory to roll out new digital offerings and to help augment the bank’s IT infrastructure.

As for SBI, multiple reports suggest that the bank is in the process of upgrading its YONO app to offer a completely digital banking offering.

Another outlier is Federal Bank. The bank is known to invest heavily in modernising its internal tech capabilities, cloud adoption as well as target growth through tie-ups with fintechs. As per, customers are extensively using the bank’s internet banking platform due to the constant investments it has made.

“The enterprise or individual of today doesn't want to experience buffering pages. The 'lift and shift' model (migrating apps and data to cloud) of ensuring early adoption of tech will ensure that the sector is near glitch-free,” Federal Bank’s Venkateswaran said.

Union Bank of India General Manager Sanjay Narayan, who leads the lender’s digital initiatives, said that the lender has put in place a board-approved compensation policy whereby the bank compensates the customer for any financial loss that they may incur due to deficiency in service on the part of the bank, or any act of omission or commission directly attributable to the bank.

“With the growing customer base and increase in the number of digital products, robust infrastructure is a must. Adding new hardware to accommodate the continuous increase in digital transactions and customer base has become one of the important aspects of providing hassle-free banking services. Cloud is one of the growing spaces being used by entities for expansion of infrastructure,” Narayan said.

The UPI puzzle — To invest or not?

On UPI, industry experts have pointed out that banks see less incentive in investing further for UPI transactions as payment systems don't fetch enough revenues for banks and payment service providers, as per government norms.

“UPI has also introduced an orchestration approach due to its scale, something that was rarely conspicuous in the Indian banking system. But ensuring scalability with the right agility and security has its own costs. Government incentive will be helpful to take care of some of the costs associated with UPI,” Venkateswaran said.

In December 2021, the government had announced a Rs 1,300 crore scheme to incentivise banks, and through them payment gateways and UPI players for transactions. To be eligible for the full incentive, banks were required to show at least 50 percent year-on-year growth in UPI transactions by the end of the last quarter of the scheme.

With the Union Ministry of Finance’s recent clarification that the government has no plans to levy charges on UPI transactions, CRISIL Research Director Aniket Dani said that further government incentives in promoting UPI will aid in the upgradation of the existing services.

“The Ministry of Finance asserted on August 22 that would continue lending financial support to boost the digital payments ecosystem in the country. This help from the government will, in turn, aid the parties in the transaction to get monetary remuneration for the probable expenses associated with the same,” Dani said.",2268,-0.5134328692047684

Last week was an exception. After reports that Wipro and Tata Consultancy Services had either slashed or deferred variable pay-outs for certain employees, Moneycontrol reported that Infosys was cutting variable pay to 70 percent.

TCS subsequently said variable pay for the first quarter had not been delayed and the entire amount would be paid as scheduled in the first or second month.

However, tech companies are under pressure after a banner year of clocking double-digit growth as enterprise clients migrated to the cloud and spent money on technology. But with high growth came an acute demand for talent and subsequently, high attrition levels.

Companies back-filled attrition by hiring a record number of freshers, but it takes months to train and deploy them in projects. As a result, they also hired experienced employees, turned to sub-contractors, and paid higher salaries to prevent employees from leaving.

Compressed margins

That was an expensive cocktail that worked in a robust demand scenario, with most employees working from home. But with offices opening up, travel costs rising, and demand looking uncertain, the cost tailwinds have tapered off, forcing companies to look at other ways to improve margins. Ergo, the cuts in variable pay.

“Margins have come off way higher than what analysts had forecast. The concern now is that with attrition going through the roof, companies had to pay much higher salaries, which impacted compensation discipline,” said a top executive in the sector who did not wish to be identified.

The executive said companies have been investing in retraining and upskilling in digital technologies, which is also taking costs up.

Elevated attrition has been a concern for a few quarters, with the rate at TCS the lowest among the IT giants at 19.7 percent for the first quarter of FY23. Attrition at Infosys climbed to 28.4 percent, while for Wipro, it was 23.3 percent.

Wipro CFO Jatin Dalal told analysts after announcing Q1FY23 results that attrition had one of the biggest impacts on the company’s cost structure. When attrition was being backfilled to replace someone with similar skills, capability and experience, companies had to pay a premium of 25 percent to 30 percent to lateral hires.

An industry executive said tech companies inflated salaries beyond what their compensation grid could afford to stay in the rat race for experienced digital talent, which compressed margins.

“Further, with travel restrictions easing and recessionary fears looming large, companies are walking the hallways of clients more often, leading to increased travel costs,” the person said.

While analysts had expected margins to be affected in the first quarter, they came in even lower than street forecasts. Wipro reported 15 percent compared to predicted margins of 16-17 percent. Infosys’ margin contracted to 20.1 percent sequentially from 21.6 percent, when expected margins were at 20.8 percent.

“Attrition is not cooling off anytime soon. There is a supply-side shortage and it takes time to deploy freshers. Companies are in a bind. A slowdown will do a world of good because it will give them time to fix the supply chain. Organisations have seen huge churn. Employees haven't met each other in the last two years,” a senior analyst told Moneycontrol.

The analyst said companies have to draw the line somewhere on profitability as efficiency had taken a backseat.

Deferred spending

However, the industry executive said the alignment of variable pay with individual and company performance is good.

“It brings greater discipline to performance management. Having said that, this cannot be uniformly applied to all levels of the workforce as the ability of those at junior levels to impact larger company performance is limited,” the executive said.

While analysts said client spending is expected to be stable for the next few quarters, there are concerns over deferments in discretionary spends or longer spending cycles in some pockets.

According to HFS Research CEO Phil Fersht, there is definitely a slowdown in demand for IT services as enterprise leaders hold fire on spending decisions due to negative economic forecasts.

“IT services firms have focused wage increases on the junior and mid-layers to stem attrition and are less concerned about senior leaders jumping ship in this economy. The leading providers are preparing for margin squeezes and a slowdown,” he said.

On the possible levers to contain this, Fersht said hiring must be slowed down, key talent retained and bonuses aligned to maintain profit margins.

Omkar Tanksale, a research analyst at Axis Securities, told Moneycontrol that it is critical that companies listen to commentary from the client side.

“There might have been a delay in the demand side or a delay in discretionary spending from the clients that may be slowing down the revenue growth momentum in the short term. However, the long-term story still remains intact. In the short term, margins are surely under stress and they are likely to control it by cutting down the mid- to higher-level variable pays and have to get the employee pyramid right to sustain the margin side,” he said.

The decisions of companies to reduce variable pay for the first quarter primarily impacts mid- and senior-level employees and may not lead to a significant uptick in attrition, but companies could lose top performers, said Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO of CIEL HR services.

Differential treatment

He said the top performers who have aspirations could be disappointed if they don’t get their bonuses and their promotions are deferred or hikes are reduced because of cost optimisation.

Mishra said it's not easy to give differential treatment to top performers in large organisations. Policies have to be applied uniformly because other employees would be disappointed and may leave, thinking the employer isn’t being fair.

“The leadership team has got a difficult job at hand to convince or to keep applying the glue which will hold their top talent. If they lose average talent or below-average talent, they may not lose their sleep, but they will lose their sleep if top talent is leaving them and that is not very unlikely,” he said.

Top talent could be headhunted by other companies that continue to hire, he said.

Last week, Wipro said in an email to employees that variable pay will not be paid to those in B and C (mid-manager level) and above, while junior employees in Bands A and B would receive 70 percent of their variable pay.

The company said there has been continued pressure on operating margins and attributed it to “inefficiency in our talent supply chain, project margins, and our investments in talent, technology, and solutions during the quarter.”

Infosys said the average variable pay-out at an organisation level is 70 percent and an employee’s final pay-out will depend on their pay grade and their unit or department. In its email to employees, Infosys said investments in hiring and compensation revisions have impacted margins in the immediate term.

TCS said on August 23 that it has not delayed variable pay to employees for the first quarter and that it was normal to give it in the first or second month.

“We have come across completely incorrect reports on our compensation. Variable pay is either paid in month one or month 2 as per the normal process and there is no delay in this process. 100% VA is being paid for Q1,” the statement by TCS said.

An email sent to employees in specific grades, a copy of which Moneycontrol has seen, had said that the performance bonus was yet to be finalised for these grades of employees.

“The performance bonus for Q1 FY23 is yet to be finalized for C3A, C3B, C4, and equivalent grades. This will be paid along with August 2022 payroll to eligible associates,” the email sent by TCS to employees read. The email did not have details regarding why the performance bonus had not been finalised at the time.

When Moneycontrol had previously reached out to TCS for comment, the company had said: “All our compensation and bonus cycles are as per plan.”

TCS’ peers Wipro and Infosys have both slashed variable pay for the first quarter, as Moneycontrol earlier reported.

Wipro will not be giving variable pay to those in Band C and above (people at mid-manager level and above), while junior employees will receive 70 percent of their variable payout. While Wipro did not comment on the quantum of variable payout, the company said in a statement that as per its plan, salary hikes will be rolled out from September 1 and it has completed the first cycle of its quarterly promotional cycle from July.

Infosys, on the other hand, has said that the average variable payout at an organisation level will be 70 percent, but the final payout varies for employees in different pay grades and different units. Infosys is yet to comment on the matter.

IT spending cycles may be delayed, but clients’ spending on technology over the next 18 months is expected to follow a stable pattern, they said.

A survey by investment firm Wedbush Securities shows that IT companies’ clients maintain a positive intent to spend on technology both in the second half of the calendar year 2022 and in the first half of 2023.

The survey studies 205 US -based enterprise buyers with representing high-tech, financial services, manufacturing, and Retail verticals.

While a slowdown may be expected in some functions, the survey said it is likely there will be strong funding for multi-year digital transformation initiatives at least for the remaining months of 2022, assuming there are no major disruptions in global economic activity.

""While the survey looks bullish for the next 18 months (2HCY22, CY23), we see a more realistic scenario, where next year’s budget cycles may be slightly delayed, a function of a combination of slowing economic activity as well as enterprises possibly reassessing post-pandemic spending priorities, resulting a in a back-end loaded CY23 for IT spending,"" Moshe Katri, leading IT analyst and managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note.

Shrinking margins amid rising fears of a global economic slowdown have battered IT stocks to three-week lows. The BSE IT Index lost 3.6 percent in the last four sessions of the slump. It is down 22 percent so far this year.

Rich valuations and an anticipated slowdown in IT spending, given rising inflation and a likely slowdown in global growth, has built pressure on IT stocks.

Transformation projects still on

Forrester Research India’s Head of Research Ashutosh Sharma told Moneycontrol that the regions where IT companies draw most of their clients—Europe or North America—are experiencing a recessionary impact during which time clients look to save on costs.

""They look at being more lean and efficient in their overall cost structures. One of the key areas that they refer to is technology spending because it is actively becoming really important for organisations to get that right. One of the ways they actually manage costs is by outsourcing more or offshoring more,"" he said.

Still, these are times of growth for clients, and bigger transformation projects are on.

""Even if they have to cut down on costs due to recessionary forces, they cut down on other discretionary spending,"" he said, adding that there is no linear relationship between gross domestic product (GDP) growth in these economies, their technology spending cuts, and growth of IT service providers.

Budgets on track

HDFC Securities’ Deputy Vice-President Amit Chandra told Moneycontrol that IT spending, which was considered to be discretionary, has now become more non-discretionary. Any slowdown in spending will also vary from sector to sector.

""There are certain pockets where you can see some kind of weakness, such as retail experience or some futuristic projects, those can get a bit delayed. But in terms of the total spend, for the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) sector and from large banks, despite moderation in revenue we have not seen any cut in IT budgets,"" he said.

Chandra said that while there is talk of a recession, there have been no signs of any reduction in capital expenditure yet by the larger companies.

""The headlines gathering around hiring freezes are happening in the US because there is a huge gap between demand and supply there. Because of that, companies don't want to hire at a very higher cost,"" he said.

Spending on specialised services to be higher

Mrinal Rai, Principal Analyst at technology research firm ISG, also maintains that there is a slowdown only in limited projects that were traditional service lines for IT companies -- such as data centre consolidation, traditional ERP, etc.

In terms of spending, he expects a reduction in regular managed services, which are being taken over by automation and newer skills.

Rai added that spending on specialised services will be higher than what it was earlier, as clients are now signing contracts based on outcomes and business process results rather than a service-level agreement that is measured on certain fixed indicators.

""Technology is able to showcase the differentiation it is bringing to an organisation’s final output,"" he said.

""Any kind of slowdown or economic downturn has anyway helped in the growth of this industry in the past. We are hopeful that because of these factors, the spending would increase or at least would remain high, but not for the traditional service lines,"" he added.",780,0.08126588968130258

Shrinking margins amid rising fears of a global economic slowdown have battered the IT stocks to three-week lows with the BSE IT index shedding 1.2 percent on Tuesday.

The BSE IT Index lost 3.6 percent through the last four sessions of slump. It was down 22 percent so far this year. Among the major tech companies, Infosys fell 1.5 percent, Tata Consultancy Services 1 percent, Wipro 2 percent, HCL Technologies 1.4 percent, and Tech Mahindra was down 1.6 percent.

Rich valuations and an anticipated slowdown in IT spends, given the rising inflation and a likely slowdown in global growth, helped build the pressure on the IT stocks. A rising employee cost because of salary hikes and premium for hiring talent amid a sustained phase of attrition, too, added to the margin pressure for the IT companies.

The brunt is not merely on the investors. Moneycontrol had reported earlier that Infosys, TCS and Wipro deferred or reduced their variable payouts to employees for the April-June quarter to defend their margins.

""After reports of variable pay cuts by Wipro and TCS, there were similar reports from Infosys, clearly reflecting that things are not as bullish as the company managements indicated after their results,"" said Sandip Sabharwal of asksandipsabharwal.com. ""With an imminent recession in most western economies, the sector needs to be a clear underweight.""

Infosys’s operating margin contracted to 20.1 percent in the first quarter of FY23, as opposed to 23.7 percent in the first quarter of FY22 and 21.5 percent in the fourth quarter of FY22. Infosys headcount as of June 30 stood at 3,35,186.

Wipro’s operating margin was down to a low of 15 percent, down 2 percent sequentially and from 18.8 percent in the year-ago period. Its attrition rate in Q1FY23 was 23.3 percent, a shade better than 23.8 percent in the previous quarter. Attrition may increase with variable pay not being given.

TCS’s operating margin in Q1 was 23.1 percent, down from 25.5 percent from the year-ago quarter, which it attributed primarily to salary increases that were rolled out from April 1. For the quarter ending June 30, 2022, TCS had a headcount of 606,331 and added 14,136 associates.

""Sharp margin misses across scale IT Services vendors in the June quarter were deeper than feared with incremental growth coming at lower margins. We expect the margin erosion to persist in the medium term and stay meaningfully below LT trends due to reversal in employee-employer bargaining power, underwhelming graduate uptake, limited price increases, return in travel/facility costs and high onsite inflation,"" said JP Morgan in its latest report.

""With seven out of 11 techs up for a wage hike in 2Q, upcoming margin decline is likely to be more broad-based. We see limited incremental margin levers ahead to cope with wage increases, persistent retention costs, subcons and creeping up travel/facility costs and find FY23/24 margin expectations optimistic. We turn more bearish on the sector and highlight structural margins rather than growth slowdown should be key sector concern,"" JP Morgan report added.",532,-0.6048804900862954

Software services major Infosys has reduced the variable payout for employees for the first quarter of FY23 due to the impact on margins.

An email sent to employees, a copy of which Moneycontrol has accessed, said that at an organisation level, the average variable payout is 70 percent. Infosys’ move to reduce payout comes days after its rivals such as TCS and Wipro deferred or reduced variable payouts for the April-June quarter in a bid to defend margins. IT companies' margins have come under pressure due to rising employee costs such as salary hikes and paying a premium for hiring talent, even as they grapple with increased attrition.

Infosys’ email to employees said that the company is fueling growth momentum with investments in talent through hiring and compensation revisions. “While these investments have impacted margins in the immediate term, we are making structured efforts to improve our performance in the quarters to come,” the email read. Moneycontrol could not immediately ascertain when the email was sent.

The variable payout will be made along with August’s salary, which is as per the company’s schedule. While the average payout is 70 percent, an individual employee’s final variable payout will depend on their unit or department’s guidelines, and varies for different pay grades and departments.

Moneycontrol has reached out to Infosys for comment, and this story will be updated when they respond.

When the company announced its earnings for Q1, it said that it gave competitive salary increases for a majority of employees based on performance in April, and salary hikes primarily for senior employees was being done from July 1.

Infosys’s operating margin contracted to 20.1 percent in Q1FY23, as opposed to 23.7 percent in Q1FY22 and 21.5 percent in Q4FY22. Its headcount as of June 30 was 3,35,186.

“Q1 margin stood at 20 percent, a drop of 150 basis points versus previous quarter. The major components of the sequential margin movement were as below: Headwinds of 1.6 percent due to salary increases, 0.4 percent due to drop in utilization as we create capacity for future, 0.3 percent due to increases in subcon third-party other costs,” CFO Nilanjan Roy had said during the company’s call with analysts.

The company kept its margin guidance at 21 percent - 23 percent and said it will be at the lower end.

For Q1, Infosys’ attrition came in at 28.4 percent, and the company had a net addition of 21,000 employees during the quarter.

Wipro had announced that the company will not be paying out the variable pay to employees in Band C and above for the quarter, and junior-level employees will receive 70 percent of their variable pay. TCS, on the other hand, had delayed variable pay by a month for specific grades—C3A, C3B, C4, and equivalent—of employees.

Infosys, like its peers, has seen elevated attrition. On an LTM basis, its Q1FY23 attrition was at 28.4 percent. Sequentially, this was up from 27.7 percent in Q4FY22 and on a year-on-year basis, it was up from 13.9 percent in Q1FY22.

Infosys has said that attrition has been declining on a quarterly basis, but said that the impact of attrition, wage hikes, as well as the cost of new hires is very dynamic.

With the company's current elevated attrition figures, which are higher than TCS and Wipro, what the impact on attrition will be with this move remains to be seen.",574,-0.33060277501742047

India’s biggest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has delayed the variable pay for senior employees for the first quarter of FY23 , a few days after rival Wipro made a similar decision as the sector braces for a slowdown.

The variable pay has been delayed for certain grades— C3A, C3B, C4 and equivalent— of employees for the June quarter.

“This will be paid along with August 2022 payroll to eligible associates,” an email, reviewed by by Moneycontrol, read. Moneycontrol has learnt that the variable pay has been paid with July’s salary to junior employees.

In a statement, TCS said its compensation and bonus cycles were as per plan.

For the quarter ending June 30, 2022, TCS had a headcount of 6,06,331 and added 14,136 associates.

TCS’s operating margin in Q1 was 23.1 percent, down from 25.5 percent from the year-ago quarter, which it attributed primarily to salary increases that were rolled out from April 1.

“The other is the continuing demand environment and the attrition environment that is leading to the increased operating costs on the employee side,” TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan had said in an earnings call. Attrition would probably take a few more months to come down, he said.

“Till then the margin pressures will continue but we hope to sequentially improve from where we are, given that we have taken a hit on that completely,” he said.

Variable pay, part of an employee’s cost to company, is linked to either the employee’s performance or that of the firm. While variable pay ranges between 10-15 percent for junior employees, it can be up to 20-30 percent of the compensation for mid to senior level employees.

Earlier this week, Moneycontrol reported that Wipro was holding back variable payouts to mid and senior-level employees for the April-June quarter. Junior-level employees, too, would only receive 70 percent of their variable pay for the quarter.

Wipro’s note to its employees blamed the move on the pressure on operating margins, which, in turn, was attributed to ""inefficiency in our talent supply chain, project margins, and our investments in talent, technology, and solutions during the quarter, which will continue as these are directed toward long-term value building.""

Wipro, whose operating margin came in at 15 percent, told employees that the company was measured on three financial metrics for variable pay—revenue, order booking, and margins, and was not paying out the variable pay due to the hit it took on margins.",411,-0.5972296714782714

Tata Neu’s chief technology officer Sauvik Banerjjee quit and exited the company a few weeks back. Banerjjee has confirmed the development to Moneycontrol.

Responding to Moneycontrol queries, Banerjjee said that he is currently outside the country and will be returning next month.

""I am a UK national and was planning to move back to a global role. I had decided a few months back and post-launch decided to move on,"" he said.

The company is looking to replace his role with external candidates, said people aware of the matter.

Prior to joining Neu in 2019, Banerjjee worked as the CTO of Tata Cliq. He joined the group in 2016 and extensively worked with TCS. He also worked with Infosys, and Accenture SAP in his previous stints.

Super app Tata Neu was launched earlier this year in April and has so far failed to garner a significant growth.

Net new client addition across revenue bands for the top four Indian IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, and HCL Technologies — remained tepid in the first quarter of FY23 ended June 30, 2022, with the exception of the $1 million plus revenue category.

Sequentially, client addition in Q1FY23 in the $1 million plus revenue band grew to 60 from just 42 clients added in Q4FY22 across the four firms. However, it dropped significantly on a year-on-year basis, when compared to the 91 clients added in the same quarter last fiscal, according to data accessed from CareEdge Research. In a YoY comparison, client addition dropped across revenue bands.

“The slowdown in client addition is an impact of higher base effect on account of a sudden post-pandemic ramp-up in Q1FY22. However, client additions gathered pace in Q1FY23 vs. Q4FY22 as Q4s are generally weak from a seasonality perspective. The growth has mostly been broad-based across verticals. BFSI continues to have the largest share and is the fastest growing segment,” Tushar Shah, Co-CEO, CareEdge Advisory & Research, said.

During Q1FY23, the mix of high-value client additions demonstrated a very strong trend. For instance, in $10 million plus bucket, 21 clients were added in Q1FY23, compared to 22 clients added in the whole of FY21, which was marred by the Covid-19 pandemic.

From a mix perspective, the $10 million plus and above bands comprised more than a third of all client additions in Q1FY23. This trend is similar to that seen in full year of FY22, where a third of the client additions were deals greater than $10 million.

“However, for very large deals with size greater than $100 million, there is indeed a slow-down seen in Q1FY23. Compared to 7 – 10% of overall client additions being in the greater than $100 million bucket during FY22, in Q1FY23, very large clients constituted only around 5% of all client additions in $1 million and above bucket,” Shah added.

Slowing deal pipeline

While most of these companies said that deal wins have been in line with expectations and that they have a visibility for Q2, there has been caution about what happens beyond that, especially in calendar year 2024, given ongoing macro uncertainties, fear of impending recession and cross-currency headwinds.

During the earnings announcement for Q1FY23, TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said that, “Projects that are currently going on, the pipeline conversion, all of that indicates a very steady demand environment. We are also constantly polling to see whether there are any early indications of softening and as of now there is nothing into the middle of the year.”

“On deal wins, it seems to kind of be cooling off and seems to indicate probably that there is a demand issue developing. When you discuss issues regarding this with the management, they generally say that as of now, things are okay,” Girish Pai, Head of Research at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, had said in an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol.",500,-0.45677629113197327

TCS expects the USD 1 billion retail sector business in the UK, Europe to outpace the company’s overall revenue growth on the back of strong demand for IT services, a senior official has said.

The country’s largest software exporter on Wednesday announced a multi-year, multi-million dollar deal with Marks & Spencer, with which it has been working for over a decade, to transform the British retailer’s human resource operations. The company’s business head of retail in Europe, Abhijit Niyogi, told PTI that the demand for IT services remains strong in Europe and the UK despite macro headwinds like inflation, rate tightening, political turmoil in the UK and the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Stating that the business headed by him has a topline contribution of over USD 1 billion a year, Niyogi said it has been clocking a revenue growth faster than the one reported by the company on an overall basis for the last two-three quarters. Around 10-15 per cent of the company’s reported total contract value (TCV) comes from the business. At present, it is chasing mid to large-size deals having a revenue possibility of around USD 300 million, as demand from retailers continues in the market.

When asked if he sees the business continuing to outpace the company’s broader revenue growth, Niyogi replied in the affirmative. “At least in FY23, I don’t see any slowdown specifically at the back of a very strong Q1. What we see for Q2 and Q3, the pipeline is very strong, the conversion ratio is also quite good, and the demand is at an all-time high,” he added. In the first quarter of the fiscal, TCS reported a 10.2 per cent growth in revenues to USD 6.7 billion, and the retail sector led the pack with over 25 per cent growth in revenues on a constant-currency basis.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra reported a steady decline in operating margins and deal wins both on a sequential basis and year-on-year basis in the three months ended June 30.

All five companies missed their profit estimates as well in the first quarter. Profitability was hit as margins came under pressure on the back of supply side pressure, as IT companies gave wage hikes in the three months ended June even as they spent more on sub-contracting.

Analysts believe the IT sector will confront softer demand and higher overhead costs going ahead although company executives maintain a positive outlook, expecting a turnaround on a steady demand pipeline even as they keep a close watch on macro headwinds.

""Results were lacklustre across top IT companies. Deal wins were down, margins took a hit. The deal wins seem to be slowing down and we could be in for pain in FY 24. We expect the demand to fall further by December, consequently the commentary on growth will also be softer,"" an analyst tracking the sector said on condition of anonymity.

Cost-saving and margin-protecting measures such as off-shoring and controls on travel and operating costs are in reverse mode, said Amit Chandra, Deputy Vice President, HDFC Securities.

“In a scenario when you are heavy with cost and demand seems to be softening, your margins take a hit and you will take a while to adjust to the new cost structure,” Chandra told Moneycontrol.

In the second half of the year, Chandra sees topline growth normalising and margins starting to expand, and believes margins will bottom out either in Q1 or Q2.

Cost savings will accrue from replacing lateral hires who are leaving with freshers, he said.

As people with 3 to 5 years of experience leave, their work is either being subcontracted or they are being replaced by costlier hires, exerting double impact on company margins.

Employee costs

Samir Sekaria, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) at TCS, said on an earnings call that salary increases that kicked in from April 1 had a 1.5 percent impact on the operating margin.

“Continued supply-side challenges entailed additional expenses, such as backfilling expenses and higher subcontractor usage. This and normalizing travel expenses negated various operational efficiencies, resulting in an operating margin of 23.1 percent, a sequential contraction of 1.9 percent,” Sekaria explained.

He added that the Q1 margin was subdued, and the company was looking at “clawing it back.” The company’s aim is for a margin in excess of 25 percent.

TCS Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Rajesh Gopinathan said the demand environment and workforce attrition was leading to increased operating costs.

“Attrition is not totally unanticipated but it is continuing and we think that probably it will take another few more months before it will start to come down. So, till then the margin pressures will continue but we hope to sequentially improve from where we are,” he added.

Attrition, salary hikes

Infosys CEO Nilanjan Roy said the industry doesn’t operate in a vacuum, and attrition trends were similar across the industry, and that the levels had started to come down. The company’s salary hikes for senior employees, which will happen in July, will impact margins a little, but not at the level in Q1, he said.

Demand dipped in Q1 because of seasonality factors, but supply-side pressures continued, resulting in cost of talent acquisition and transition, HCL Technologies CFO Prateek Aggarwal said.

Aggarwal said higher travel, visa and outsourcing costs, and employee retention and attrition costs had dented margins. HCL’s margin during Q1 was 17%, having declined over the last five quarters. The company maintained its margin guidance of 18-20%.

“Bill rate enhancements, successes in pockets are expected to pick up steam in the next few quarters and cost initiatives in terms of fresher billing and pyramid optimization as well as utilization improvement, offshoring of work, automation initiatives, and optimizing the outsource spend, subcontractor costs are the levers that we are banking on to get back into the guided range on margins,” Aggarwal said.

Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte said during an analyst call that he believes the operating margin had bottomed out, and blamed the lower Q1 margin on investments.

CFO Jatin Dalal said the company was using the pyramid model, which involves having more employees with less experience at the bottom, which will help keep costs low, and fewer employees higher up, to improve margins.

“That is the only lever which can reduce the cost pressure that we have seen in the last 18 months,” he said, adding that attrition moderating should help as the company had been paying new employees a premium to replace those with similar capabilities and experience.

Tech Mahindra CFO Rohit Anand said the Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) margin in the first quarter had fallen 220 basis points on a sequential basis to 11% because of factors including higher salaries, deal transition costs and seasonality.

Is deal pipeline drying up?

“Margins have bottomed out but growth numbers are still to moderate, I think the bigger risk is to the growth number,” said Chandra of HDFC Securities.

Girish Pai, Head of Research at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, told Moneycontrol, “On deal wins, it seems to kind of be cooling off and seems to indicate probably that there is a demand issue developing. When you discuss issues regarding this with the management, they generally say that as of now, things are okay. HCL Tech made an interesting comment that the demand situation is looking better than what it did three months back.”

Pai said his team was the first to downgrade the IT sector even before the fourth quarter results in early April 2022. “We had said that FY23 margin is going to be a problem, and demand is going to be a problem in FY24,” he said.

Analysts noticed that the latest commentary by IT companies on demand had become muted to what they were saying three months back.

“The way I see this sector play out is there's a lot of time-wise correction. There's been one price correction and we keep reacting to the news flow coming from the US. So, my take is that the US news flow will incrementally deteriorate as we go towards the end of 2022. It'll probably weaken substantially in the first half of 2023,” Pai explained.​",1093,-0.3431481619675954

Hiring and attrition remained pain points for information technology (IT) companies in the first quarter of the 2023 financial year amid an ongoing battle for tech talent.

The top five IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra — cumulatively added a net 59,704 employees in the three months ended June, including freshers and lateral hires.

Net additions at TCS, HCL and Infosys declined sequentially but Wipro and Tech Mahindra reported an increase. On a sequential basis, overall net additions were significantly down across these five companies, which had hired 85, 720 new employees in the three months ended March.

On a year-on-year basis, the number was an improvement over the first quarter of the last financial year, when these companies had hired 41,471 people.

The attrition rate inched up at Infosys, TCS and HCL nd moderated at Wipro and Tech Mahindra.

Hiring has been muted at many IT companies in the quarter, but hiring plans for FY23 are broadly on track, said Piyush Pandey, Lead Analyst - Institutional Equities, YES Securities.

“Freshers also generally join from Q2 onwards so that also explains lower hiring for Q1. A few of these companies had slightly lower utilisation (due to big hiring in FY22) and have sufficient room to grow just by increasing utilisation,” Pandey said.

In FY23, TCS plans to hire 40,000 freshers, Infosys has guided for 50,000, Wipro 38,000, HCL 35,000 and Tech Mahindra around 10,000.

The difference in net additions this quarter at the top IT companies is a result of which of them reacted to the surge in demand cycle first when the pandemic broke out, and started hiring in large numbers consequentially, said Amit Chandra, Deputy Vice President, HDFC Securities.

“Some companies started hiring early, and the maximum bulk of hiring happened last year. Some started a bit late. So that's why the quarter-on-quarter variation you are seeing,” Chandra said.

“The general trend is that TCS started hiring a bit early, and Infosys, they're still hiring. You have to see this from the point of view of what happened pre-pandemic. For the last 3-4 years these companies didn't hire much,” Chandra told Moneycontrol.

Broadening of the pyramid

The hiring trends have been closely related to cost control and hence the operating margins of the IT companies. Over the past five-six quarters, these margins have been consistently declining, with many expecting them to bottom out in another quarter before starting to improve.

Wipro Chief Financial Officer Jatin Dalal said employee costs have had key impact on margins, calling “pyramid and fresher improvement” a key lever to improving margins.

The pyramid model involves having more employees with less experience at the bottom, which will help keep costs low, and fewer employees higher up the pyramid.

Dalal said Wipro intends to double fresher hiring from last year’s level adding that the company’s ability to “correct the pyramid through consistent improvement of the base and moving people up through the pyramid would be a big structural lever.”

Trainee bench

TCS Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan shared a similar outlook, stating that Q1 was a lighter quarter comparatively for trainee absorption by the company, with Q2 and Q3 being the main periods for hiring.

“Last year, we had gone very aggressive and hired through the year to build up a more than 100,000 trainee bench. This year is more normal. We're progressing well on that 40,000 [fresher hiring] mark,” he said.

C Vijayakumar, CEO of HCL Technologies, attributed the decline in net hiring from 11,000 in Q4FY22 to 2,089 in Q1FY23 to additional capacity created by hiring of both freshers and laterals.

""We have not moderated any hiring based on any demand environment. It's really to increase our utilization and better deployment of freshers,” he said, adding that the company plans to take onboard 10,000 freshers in Q2.

Pre-pandemic, IT companies didn’t hire much and concentrated on adoption of automation, for which “the industry is paying the price” now, said HDFC Securities’ Chandra.

With the pandemic leading to a sudden increase in demand for tech services, attrition was extremely high, especially among employees who had over three years of experience or were in the five-eight-year experience bracket.

Companies are aware that bringing freshers into the billing cycle takes a period of six-eight months, Chandra said.

HCL’s Vijayakumar said the average time to make a fresher billable was taking longer in some parts of the business.",803,0.18689434130986532

Tech Mahindra on July 25 said it is currently working on 60 metaverse projects across 25 clients globally. The IT services company, which announced this during its Q1FY23 results, clocked in $802 million total contract value (TCV) of deal wins for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, in line with the management’s estimations.

In Q4FY22, TCV of deals stood at $1.01 billion while in the same quarter (Q1) last year, it was at $805 million.

“It (metaverse) is one of our fastest growing verticals, we announced this practice in February this year. We are already working on about 60 projects globally and for 25 customers. They are coming from Edtech, Retail, automotive deal management, repair and maintenance of cars--- we are seeing different kinds of customer base but it is clearly one of our fastest growing verticals,” CP Gurnani, CEO and MD, Tech Mahindra said while addressing the media.

In terms of overall deal wins, communications, media and entertainment (CME) grew 19.1 percent YoY, which contributes over 40 percent to Tech Mahindra’s revenue. Technology vertical grew by 30.3 percent YoY and BFSI grew about 20 percent YoY.

Profit plunged

Tech Mahindra’s profit took a hit in Q1, declining 24.8 percent on a sequential basis to Rs. 1,132 crore from Rs. 1, 506 crore last quarter, accounting for pressure in margin performance given the ongoing wage hikes and increase in travel costs.

On a YoY basis, profit was down by 16.4 percent.

“On profitability, considering the investments that we are making, and the fact that we are building new practices, was hit. Overall, we remain positive of our deal pipeline and more enthusiastic about our ability to harness from that deal pipeline. We are happy about the overall investments we made in 5G, IoT, cloud and now in metaverse, all coming together. There’s still a lot of work to be done,” said Gurnani.

He added, “We are confident that we will be presenting to you industry leading growth over the next few quarters, we are also confident that we will have an opportunity to work on the profitability levers. We have identified where we would focus and in the next few quarters we are determined to work on and deliver profitability.”

Remains ‘watchful’

Just like peers TCS and L&T Infotech (LTI), Tech Mahindra addressed a the performance with an air of caution due to the ongoing macro headwinds.

Gurnani highlighted, “In different parts of the world, there are signs of worry regarding the economic headwinds, related to inflation, energy crisis and how different sectors will respond if there’s a slowdown. Tech Mahindra has looked at all sectors and what-if scenarios, and all I can say is we as Tech Mahindra will continue to deliver stronger performance.”",498,-0.19269464612007142

Indian technology giants are always in a fray, but the recent trends indicate that Infosys has outplayed its immediate rivals TCS and HCL Tech, for yet another quarter.

Infosys, the second largest IT company in the country, delivered 21.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) constant currency revenue growth, while in rupee terms, the growth was 17.5 percent – more than Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Tech, the other two companies in the Top 3 league.

In terms of operating margins, however, Infosys' performance was worst with a contraction of 360 basis points on-year to 20 percent. TCS reported a 240-basis-point cut in margins to 23.1 percent and HCL Tech margin shrank 260 basis points to 17 percent.

“The Q1 earnings report suggests strong revenue growth with Infosys leading the Tier I techs on growth, though margins disappointed relative to expectations with a 150-bps sequential drop,” said Manik Taneja, Vice-President, JM Financial Services.

Analysts largely do not see any change in the trend.

Aniket Pande, Lead Analyst at ICICI Securities, said Infosys will remain the fastest growing in its IT coverage universe. “We do believe Infosys is well positioned to gain market share and is suitably equipped for industry-leading growth,” he said.

Broadly speaking, Pande is underweight on the IT sector and believes deployment in the sector should be very slow and gradual. However, he said that his pecking order in the IT space remains TCS, Infosys, Coforge and Persistent Systems.

Analysts have turned cautious on the IT sector recently as, after a bout of high growth, the numbers have started moving towards the mean. They see recession in the US and Europe as one of the key risks.

Most IT companies have also slowed down their hiring, at the same time attrition level remains high. All three companies discussed here reported attrition rate of IT services employees between 20 percent and 29 percent, with Infosys being on the higher end and TCS on the lower end. Hiring is considered as the lead indicator of demand as companies hire more when they believe there will be more demand in the future.

The management, however, has shrugged off these worries. Rajesh Gopinathan, the TCS chief executive, said one should not read too much into hiring numbers, and contended that hiring remains strong. He committed that the company will hire 40,000 freshers in FY23. HCL Tech also said its target to hire 30,000-35,000 freshers is intact.

What has been a positive surprise is that despite talks of slowdown management have either maintained or increased their revenue growth guidance. HCL Tech kept guidance at 12-14 percent CC growth in revenue and EBIT Margins to be in the 18-20 percent range.

Infosys increased FY23 revenue guidance to 14-16 percent while retaining margin guidance at 21-23 percent. Though analysts said both companies will likely see margins at the lower end of the guidance. TCS does not give any guidance but the management assured string growth.

“It (Infosys) expects to see benefits of utilisation improvement, pricing leverage, pyramid optimisation along with moderation in subcontracting expenses to aid margins going forward,” Taneja.

These factors will also work for other companies.

Talking about TCS, Pande said he believes margins have bottomed out and will improve hereon as subcontractor costs and supply-side cost pressures subside gradually given normalisation of demand going forward. “Besides, levers of pyramid optimisation, utilisation and INR depreciation will benefit margins, though impact of these will be backended.”

Analysts’ ratings have been mixed on all three stocks. However, most are neutral with some saying ‘buy’ on these counters given the headwinds and growth trajectory from hereon.",642,0.23296781686636117

The chief executive officers of Indian information technology companies such as Wipro, TCS, and Infosys are being paid big bucks as attrition rates surge among employees, according to a report by CNBC.

IT major Wipro’s CEO Thierry Delaporte earned $10.5 million in FY22. Infosys CEO Salil Parekh began drawing $10.2 million this year under the terms of a new five-year contract, almost doubling his pay from 2021.

This means that Parekh and Delaporte will earn more in roughly three hours than the average employee would in an entire year, according to back-of-the-envelope calculations by Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES), an association of software employees in India.

NITES President Harpreet Singh Saluja told CNBC that Indian IT CEOs are taking home obscenely high salaries despite layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Those that skirted layoffs did so by announcing pay cuts,” Saluja said, as per the report.

The CEO of India’s largest software company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Rajesh Gopinathan drew the lowest salary among his peers, with his pay totaling $3.2 million.

Meanwhile, Mohandas Pai, who served on Infosys’ board in its early days as an outsourcing company, said billable employee pay has remained almost flat since 2009, while that of senior executives has gone up many times over.

Between 600,000 and 650,000 people were hired in India’s technology sector in 2021, according to Pai, who called it the largest hiring spree in the world. He estimated between 1.4 million and 1.5 million people will be hired “over the next two years in India across IT services and start-ups.”

Former Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) chief financial officer (CFO) Ramakrishnan Venkataraman, fondly known as Ramki, passed away in the early hours of July 21 at his home in Bengaluru.

Venkataraman, who retired in April 2021, was in the position since February 2017.

The company was deeply saddened by his demise, TCS said in a statement. ""Ramki’s invaluable contributions across his many roles left an indelible mark on TCS. He was above all a true gentleman who would always have a smile and a nice word for everyone. Today, TCSers have lost not just an esteemed leader, but a man who stood true to his values and lived his life with utmost humility. Our deepest condolences to his family,"" the company said.

In a career spanning 40 years, Venkataraman worked with Tata Motors, Tata Elxsi and in the consumer electronics industry. He spent close to eight years at TCS America and nearly 14 years at TCS as vice president of finance and then the CFO.

An alumnus of Chennai's Loyola College, Venkataraman was also a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the Institute of Company Secretaries of India and the Institute of Cost Accountants of India.

""To me, he was a great human being. I’ve lost a colleague, a friend and a professional. We share with the family in this loss,” S Ramadorai, former TCS CEO and former Tata Elxsi chairman, who knew Ramki since his Tata Elxsi days, said. He was one of the brightest, humble and unspoken performers, he said.

“To me, it’s almost like a family member. He was one of our closest — in terms of how we mentored him, and saw him grow and perform. We met him last on Monday at my office in Bombay where I spent an hour with him where we exchanged notes. I met with him on every trip to Bangalore. We used to spend some time not just on the IT companies but on some of the innovation that is happening in the Bangalore area,” Ramadorai said.

A Tata veteran, Ramki started his career at Tata Motors. Prior to joining TCS, he was the head of finance and company secretary at Tata Elxsi. He took over as the finance head for TCS in America in 1999 and then joined the company in Bengaluru in 2007.

A possible decline in margins also did not help.

Now most IT stocks are available at close to their multi-year average valuations, prompting some analysts to go bullish on the sector. This is despite recessionary pressure on their key markets.

There are two key segments in the IT sector: midcaps and largecaps. Each has their own growth trajectories and prospects. The question is what should you buy into? Analysts say recent earnings hold the key to a part of the question.

Earnings

Most largecap IT stocks, which have come out with their June quarter numbers, have lagged in terms of growth compared to their midcap peers. Smaller size and having a niche worked in their favour.

For instance, TCS first quarter profits were up five percent year-on-year (YoY) while revenue grew 16 percent. Similarly, HCL Tech reported flat growth in profits and 17 percent jump in revenue. Mindtree saw 37 and 36 percent jump in profits and revenue, respectively. Tata Elxsi’s profits and revenue grew 62 and 30 percent, respectively.

“Despite steeper corrections in most midcap IT companies, they are likely to perform better than largecap companies as their contract sizes are lower and growth is on a lower base,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities.

He highlighted that midcap companies like L&T Infotech, Mindtree, and Tata Elxsi have reported stable revenue growth and their profitability was above expectations. Jasani has a positive view on L&T Infotech and Mphasis, thanks to strong deal wins, record of retaining key customers, and healthy balance sheets.

Though, some see red flags pop up in the midcap space.

YES Securities highlighted that though midcap companies that have reported results so far have performed better than largecaps on both revenue and margins, a few clients have become cautious on global macros as indicated by their managements.

It said L&T Infotech and Coforge are its picks in this space.

Recession fears

Some analysts like those at YES Securities favour largecaps over midcap IT names as any potential recession or slowdown in the US would lead to vendor consolidation favouring largecaps.

Many economists have raised fears that Europe and the US may plunge into recession as central banks raise interest rates to fight inflation. Turmoil in the energy market due to Russian invasion of Ukraine also adds to concerns.

“The demand environment remains strong as indicated by deal booking and a healthy deal pipeline. The companies which have reported results have not seen any deal deferment/ cancellation due to evolving macroeconomic concerns. Also with wage hike behind, they should see sequential improvement in EBIT margin over next three quarters,” said YES Securities, adding it believes valuation has corrected to comfortable levels.

The brokerage house prefers Infosys and TCS in the space.

Jasani of HDFC also has a positive view on these two stocks due to stronger demand environment in North America versus Europe, strong order bookings, and wider bouquet of services and specialisations.

Though he remarked that if the fears of recession in the US and other developed economies keep rising, then IT spending could get impacted, diluting the revenue visibility of IT companies.",544,0.04424223516668592

Six of the 10 most valued firms suffered a combined erosion of Rs 1,68,260.37 crore from their market valuation last week, mainly dragged down by IT major TCS amid an overall weak trend in the equity market. The 30-share BSE benchmark Sensex fell 721.06 points or 1.32 per cent last week.

From the laggards, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) took the biggest hit as its market valuation tumbled Rs 99,270.07 crore to reach Rs 10,95,355.32 crore. Shares of TCS dropped last week after the company’s June quarter earnings failed to meet market expectations.

Another IT behemoth Infosys also suffered an erosion of Rs 35,133.64 crore, taking its valuation to Rs 6,01,900.14 crore.

HDFC Bank’s market valuation fell by Rs 18,172.43 crore to Rs 7,57,659.72 crore and that of State Bank of India (SBI) declined by Rs 8,433.76 crore to Rs 4,27,488.90 crore.

“We see that technology budgets in our sector are secure for calendar year 2022. In fact, some clients are asking us to advance execution of certain projects in calendar year 2022 as they have the budgets to do so,” Sudhir Chaturvedi, President Sales and Executive Board Member, LTI said at the earnings press conference for quarter ended June 30, 2022 (Q1FY23).

Chaturvedi added, “We are not seeing any immediate impact in terms of project cancellations or deferments on account of the macro situation, but we are sensing a level of caution in the client environment especially when it comes to spending in calendar year 2023. We are remaining close to our clients to understand their plans for the same. We are focussed on the short-term accelerations we are seeing in demand for most clients. This puts us in a favourable position for a strong Q2.”

This also reiterates the concerns of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), as CEO Rajesh Gopinathan highlighted during the company’s earnings call last week. Gopinathan said that the company will continue to remain vigilant despite a strong deal pipeline expected in the upcoming quarters.

LTI too remains optimistic of its deal wins in the second and third quarter of FY23.

Deal wins

LTI witnessed a net new deal TCV of $79 million in Q1FY23, which remains flat as in Q4FY22, where the company reported $80 million worth of new deal TCV. The IT services company also won a large deal together with Mindtree with a global travel technology company based in Europe.

“LTI had a 2.9 percent QoQ constant currency growth, YoY was 26.6 percent. We had a seasonal pass through in Q4 and our revenue adjusted for that seasonal pass through of license revenue. It would have been 5.1 percent in constant currency terms. We closed 4 large deals with a net new TCV of $79 million this quarter, two of which are with Fortune 500 clients and this is spread across verticals and geography perspective,” Chaturvedi said.

“Our current large deal pipeline continues to remain same as Q4 and we remain positive as we have a large deal pipeline of over $2 billion at this point. We have added 29 new logos across verticals this quarter, the highest we have added in past nine quarters. Four of them are Fortune 500 companies, taking the total to 77,” he added.

Across verticals, geographies and service lines, BFSI alone is about 47 percent of LTI’s total revenue, growing at CAGR of 19 percent over the last three years. LTI’s insurance vertical remained soft for the last two years, but is now showing strong signs of growth - growing 18 percent YoY.

“North America and Europe remain strong geographies for us. Despite macro concerns in Europe, we are growing at 32 percent YoY,” he said.

Hiring plans remain on track

Interestingly, LTI’s attrition rate went down by around 20 bps to 23.8 percent on an LTM basis in Q1 as compared to 24 percent in Q4FY22. This is the first time it started stabilising after a steady increase over the past six-seven quarters.

LTI added over 2,100 freshers in Q1, and remains on track to add a total of at least 6,500 freshers this fiscal.

“Hiring continues to work well for us. Our net headcount addition has been 2,100 in Q1, in line with our previous quarter as we continue to build for strong Q2. We remain on track with our fresher hiring plans of adding at least 6,500 freshers in FY23,” Nachiket Deshpande, Chief Operating Officer and Executive Board Member, LTI said.

LTI reported consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 633.50 crore for Q1, up by 27.64 percent from Rs 496.30 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.

On a sequential basis, profit for the remained nearly flat compared to Rs 637 crore in the March quarter.

The product and platform business, which had declined by 24 percent QoQ last quarter, has started recovering, helping HCL bag nine net new large product deal wins and $104 million in revenue.

However, the overall deal wins is slightly lower on a QoQ basis as compared to the TCV of $2.26 billion reported in Q4FY22.

HCL Tech had a strong booking this quarter with 16 deals across life sciences, healthcare, manufacturing, financial services and technology segments. It’s a mix of large and mid-sized deals.

C Vijayakumar, CEO & MD, HCL Technologies said, “FY23 started on a strong note. Revenue grew 2.7 percent sequentially and 15.6 percent YoY in constant currency. Our services business grew 19 percent YoY. Our growth momentum was led by ER&D services and digital applications services with cloud transformation being a central feat across all verticals and solutions.”

He added, “We also saw strong recovery in product and platform business which grew 5.1 percent sequentially and 1.4 percent YoY in constant currency. We posted an EBIT performance of 17 percent this quarter. Margins in services business are under pressure mainly due to an increase in talent costs and transition costs. We have undertaken appropriate actions to improve our profitability profile, the results of which will start reflecting in coming quarters.”

Margin improvement initiatives for the company include both revenue and cost levers led by innovative pricing, rate increases and optimisation of the operating costs, both people and non-people.

Segment-wise growth came from engineering and R&D (ER&D) services which led with a 3.7 percent QoQ growth, followed by ITBS with a 2 percent growth QoQ.

HCL Tech is also getting more large-sized end-to-end engineering services deals, signing two large ones in Q1, one with a European ISP (internet service provider) and one with a global ISP.

Starting this quarter, HCL will be reporting services and product businesses separately.

Geographically, growth was led by Europe (22.5 percent), Americas (17.5 percent) and ROW (18.2 percent).",399,0.7619184255599976

Restructuring at Cognizant Technology Solutions results from the evolving nature of digital transformation deals and will help keep attrition in check, The Economic Times quoted analysts as saying.

As a part of the exercise, digital business and technology (DB&T) and digital business operations (DBO) units will merge to create four new integrated practices.

According to the report, Rajesh Nambiar would cease to serve as executive vice president and president of DB&T as part of the rejig but remain as executive vice president, chairman and managing director of Cognizant India.

Annadurai Elango will lead core technology and insights, while Rob Vatter will lead enterprise platform services. Elango and Vatter will join Cognizant’s executive committee and report directly to CEO Brian Humphries.

CEO of HfS Research, Phil Fersht, said in an interview to The Economic Times that it is more critical than ever to align delivery organisations with market-facing teams. Previously, Cognizant's delivery and client-facing teams were operating separately. This merger allows staff in delivery roles to get more involved in higher-value business activities and the client-facing staff to get more involved in delivery issues.

In the medium to long term, the merger will create more challenging and exciting career paths for staff, especially for those based in India, he added.

Nambiar’s complete focus on the India role is to check attrition, improve Cognizant as an employer brand in India and ensure the merger works out, Fersht said.

Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO of Everest Group, said, ""The Teaneck, New Jersey-based company's new structure aligns with where the industry is heading. By breaking the digital business into four sub-groups, Cognizant may become more nimble.""

“The old cog structure was becoming unwieldy and looked out of date,” he added.

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCS

TCS reported revenue of USD6.7b in 1QFY23, up 3.5%/1.3% QoQ in constant currency (CC)/USD terms, in-line with our estimates. Revenue in 1QFY23 was led by Retail & CPG, while regional markets remain a drag. It reported deal TCV of USD8.2b (flat YoY, book-to-bill ratio at 1.2x), in-line with its historical trajectory, although down 27% from its 4QFY22 record booking. Q1 EBIT margin was at multi-year low, as it dipped 190bp QoQ to 23.1% (vs. our estimate of 23.9%) due to elevated supply side pressure. Wage hike in Q1 negatively impacted EBIT margins by 150bp. Elevated attrition, all time high subcontractor cost and resumption of travel expenses also impacted margins during the quarter. Lower other income also resulted in lower Net Profit, down 4% QoQ to INR95b.

Outlook

We maintain our positive stance on TCS. Our TP of INR3,730 implies 28x FY24E EPS, with a 14% upside potential. We reiterate our Buy rating.

Emkay Global Financial's report on TCS

Q1FY23 operating performance was a tad below expectations. Revenue grew 1.3% QoQ to USD6.78bn (3.4%/15.5% QoQ/YoY CC). EBITM declined 190bps QoQ to 23.1% due to salary hikes, higher backfilling costs due to attrition and an uptick in travel expenses. Revenue growth was broad-based and led by Retail & CPG (25.1% CC YoY), Communication and Media (19.6%), Manufacturing (16.4%), Technology & Services (16.4%), BFSI (13.9%), and Life Sciences & Healthcare (11.9%). Deal intake was steady with USD8.2bn TCV (book-to-bill at 1.2x). The deal pipeline velocity and deal closures remained strong; however, considering macro uncertainties, management remains watchful. TCS expects technology spending to remain resilient and expects the secular tailwinds to drive healthy growth over the medium term.

Outlook

We cut FY23-25 EPS estimates by 1-3% due to the Q1 miss. The demand environment remains healthy in the near term; however, macro uncertainties weigh on valuations. We maintain Hold with a revised TP of Rs3,200 at 23x Jun’24E EPS (earlier TP Rs3,250)

The country's largest software exporter TCS on Friday reported a 5.2 per cent rise in the June quarter net profit to Rs 9,478 crore, restricted by the impact of annual wage hikes and promotions that took operating profit margins to multi-quarter lows. The Tata Group company, which is the first in the country's over USD 220 billion software exports industry to report earnings, however, said that it does not see any adverse business impact because of worries around recession in its key markets.

It reported a 16.2 per cent growth in revenue at Rs 52,758 crore for the quarter, with all the big geographies and business segments reporting strong numbers, but it was operating profit margins, which slid down to 23.1 per cent much lower than the aspirational band of over 26 per cent that hurt the profit growth. Company's managing director and chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan hinted that this is the bottom for the margins, attributing the fall to annual wage hikes and promotions, which drilled a 1.50 per cent hole.

Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher said the company has missed on both revenue and margins in the June quarter results. ""Q1 FY23 operating performance was a tad below expectations,"" according to a research report on TCS by Emkay Global Financial Services.

This was the first quarter ever since the organisational restructuring of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) came into being in April 2022. At its Q1FY23 results on July 8, TCS gave a glimpse of how this is playing out.

Through this restructuring, TCS had divided its clients into four distinctive business groups depending on the clients' journey with the IT major instead of verticals and geographies. These were acquisition group, relationship incubation group, enterprise group and finally business transformation group.

Speaking at the earnings meet, senior executives shared that the relationship incubation group grew over 5 percent this quarter in terms of revenue growth from the clients in that category while business transformation group reported 5.6 percent growth in revenue. Meanwhile, enterprise group grew over 17 percent but on a YoY basis.

N Ganapathy Subramaniam, COO, TCS said, “Overall the growth has been broad based across the three distinctive groups we have created. Moving forward we will give more details on how we are performing in each of these groups, but I am pleased to say that Business Transformation Group clocked 5.6 percent growth this quarter. Likewise, Relationship Incubation Group has also had above 5 percent growth and Enterprise Group also grew more than 17 percent YoY.”

“The organisation has come together very smoothly. Transitions are almost complete. In fact, front-end transitions are all complete. Some of the backend transitions are still ongoing. Overall, we are quite happy with the progress. This has injected fresh energy into the teams. The world approached to curated customer journeys, that has resonated with very strongly with our teams and customers,” said Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO & MD, TCS.

Gopinathan added, “All of this should give us good buoyancy but I don’t want to be drawn to be giving a specific number. The proof point of that will not be on the revenue side, but we are expecting a greater vibrancy on the bottom end of our client pyramid as they make the progression from lower revenue band to the upper revenue band. That is one metric that will give an idea of how good the structure is, but you need to give it time to really deliver on those strategic drivers.”

Earlier today, the IT services major announced its Q1 results, clocking in Rs 9,478 crore in net profit, a jump of 5.21 percent YoY against Rs 9,008 crore in the same quarter last year. On a QoQ basis though, it was down 4.51 percent.

This is a push in the direction to get employees back to office, even as the company has plans to put in place a structured hybrid working model by 2025.

Addressing the media after the company announced its earnings, CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said that for now, they will continue to drive the return to office more until it gets to regular levels or at least 80 percent.

“The 25/25 plan needs to be executed in a more controlled manner and so the path to that will first involve getting back to a more normal working environment and then getting to the permanent hybrid model. We’ll keep driving it up back to our regular figures — 50-60-70-80 percent— as we go forward. We should see steady progress on it every month,” he said.

In April 2020, TCS announced its 25/25 model — where no more than 25 percent of employees would need to work out of its offices at a time, and would not have to spend more than 25 percent of their time there. They had also said that as they go along, more than 25 percent of the team of any project may not be located in one single location.

Gopinathan has earlier said this would need to be done in a more deliberate way, as opposed to continuing things as they are currently where most employees continue to work from home. For this, TCS has stressed that it will get employees back into the office first.

TCS’ attrition for the quarter was 19.7 percent, up from 17.4 percent in the Q4FY22. The company added over 14,000 employees during the April-June quarter, and has over 6 lakh employees on its payroll.",302,0.9113118946552277

With continued uncertainty due to fears of a recession and uncertainty in Europe, Tata Consultancy Services CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said while pipeline velocity and deal closures continue to be strong, the company is vigilant due to macro-level uncertainties.

TCS kicked off the IT results for the quarter on July 8, with profit increasing by 5% year-on-year. In terms of deal wins, the IT services major saw a decline from last quarter -- from $11.3 billion to $8.2 billion. It added nine new clients to the $100 mn-plus band YoY and 19 clients to the $50 mn-plus band.

TCS had a total contract value (TCV) of $8.2 billion in Q1FY22. Gopinathan added that the company is seeing steady demand based on client discussions, and the same is reflected in their deal pipeline and closures.

In terms of customer addition, TCS said it added customers across all revenue bands. Its $100-mn-plus customer base grew by nine on a year-on-year basis going to 59 clients for the quarter. Growth, he said, has been broad-based across geographies and sectors.

The CEO added that demand for technology continues to be robust, and is similar to the themes that have driven them in the recent past — cloud transition, as well as investments in customer experience and other operating model transformation initiatives. These initiatives, he added, are both on the growth side as well as on the transformation side.

“Projects that are currently going on, the pipeline conversions, all of that indicates a very steady demand environment. We are also constantly polling to see whether there are any early indications of softening and as of now there is nothing into the middle of the year,” he said.

Customers are focussed, he said, adding they don’t see a footprint of the recession on the demand.

“The pipeline build is quite strong and the nature of deals are also remaining fairly strong. We are now running at about 1.2 times book-to-bill which is above our long-term average. On an immediate basis, the demand continues to be pretty strong,” he said.

TCS overhauled its organisation structure, and as a result of it, the CEO said they don’t just expect an impact on revenue but also expect to see greater vibrancy on the bottom end of the client pyramid as we see the progression from lower to upper revenue backgrounds. He added that the new structure needs time to start delivering.

Revenue and earnings of Indian IT companies will take a massive hit from the US recession, according to a latest report from Jefferies.

Whenever US real GDP growth has fallen to zero percent, and this has happened twice (see graph below), global IT services spends have seen a marked growth moderation and growth for Indian IT services. The same trend is expected to play out in CY23 and FY24, added Jefferies.

They see revenue growth for the companies moderating sharply by 340bps in FY24, and the analysts have cut their revenue and EPS estimates by up to 15 percent. They expect earnings cuts to lead to further PE derating for the stocks. Jefferies has lowered their target prices by 20-45 percent and their target PEs by 20-40 percent. Their earnings’ estimates diverge from consensus estimates, and the divergence is the least for TCS and Infosys, and highest for TechM and Wipro.

Also read: Strong cross-currency headwinds ahead for IT industry

Consensus EPS estimates for FY24 have already been lowered by 2-6 percent from peak but they are far from the 8-40 percent cuts seen during previous recessions. “This suggests that downward earnings revision cycle has only just begun,” said their report.

Larger companies are likely to be better placed because clients may choose to fund their transformation programmes by “lowering discretionary spends, increasing large outsourcing deals and potentially consolidating IT vendors”. In this context, wrote the analysts, TCS/ Infosys are better placed while Mindtree/Coforge are the worst placed. Indian IT services firms have consistently gained market share over the last 20 years and they may gain more, with vendor consolidation.

Over the last few years, the IT companies’ clients increased their discretionary IT spends (see below) with contract durations and value decreasing. This trend is likely to see a reversal. “With clients looking to cut costs through large outsourcing deals, deal sizes/ duration will rise,” said the report.

With mid-sized firms more dependent on a few clients, they are more vulnerable.

The good news is that Indian IT is better placed than previous recessions.

“While a sharp moderation in growth is almost certain in FY24, we do note that this recession is different in two key ways. First, clients are undergoing large-scale tech transformation which might not be abruptly stopped. Given this, growth in global IT spends might remain above trend-rate beyond FY24. Second, Indian IT companies have emerged as strong transformation partners while maintaining their cost leadership which should impact them less vs. their global counterparts,” said the report.",452,-0.10943308141496447

It is up from 17.4 percent in Q4FY22. TCS added 14,136 employees in the first quarter of FY23, taking its headcount to over 6 lakh. On a year-on-year basis, its net addition numbers were down from 24,000 in Q1FY22 to 14,000 in Q1FY23.

TCS had announced a hiring target of 40,000 for FY23 at the end of FY22. TCS CFO Samir Seksaria said the company is on track to hire 40,000 people this fiscal, and is not its changing hiring target. The company's leadership said hiring is positioned to contract or expand depending on demand.

Commenting on the attrition numbers, CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said attrition in this quarter should be also considered from a seasonality perspective as junior level employees go for studies or other areas, but said that it has not yet started to dip.

""On an absolute basis, it is continuing to increase, though on a percentage basis, it is starting to flatten and we expect that that may continue into part of Q2 also. It will be H2 when we will start seeing some amount of more meaningful moderation of it. That's our immediate short-term view on attrition but from a medium long term, we think that both the supply side as well as the demand side is easing up - in terms of talent coming from outside of the immediate industry system and that should play into moderation,"" he said.

Chief HR officer Milind Lakkad said in a statement the company has invested in strategic talent development initiatives and the linking of learning to career development has “energized our workforce.”

He added that employees have received salary increases of 5-8 percent, and top performers have got bigger hikes. “Continued hiring momentum resulted in a milestone quarter, with the employee strength crossing the 600,000 mark,” he said.

The company added that about 20 percent of the workforce now works out of its offices.

CFO Samir Seksaria also said it was a challenging quarter as the operating margin reflected the impact of the annual salary increase, “the elevated cost of managing the talent churn” and gradually normalising travel expenses.

TCS had hired over 1 lakh freshers in FY22 and in the last quarter — Q4FY22 — the company had added 35,209 employees.

Attrition has continued to be a concern for the company in what is an industry-wide problem, with attrition going up from 8.6 percent in Q1FY22, 11.9 percent in Q2, 15.3 percent in Q3, and 17.4 percent in Q4, and 19.7 percent now in Q1FY23.

However, it is important to note that despite elevated attrition levels, TCS’ was the lowest among its peers last year.

In a note, Kotak Institutional Equities had said attrition levels of over 20 percent were expected across IT services companies “as they deal with talent crunch in a buoyant demand environment.” Reliance Securities said though attrition would remain elevated, “it has peaked out for now” and expects moderation in attrition in IT services in the second half of FY23.",536,-0.20355276550565446

The company said its constant currency (cc) revenue growth was at 15.5 percent year-on-year (YoY). Operating margin was at 23.1 percent, registering a contraction of 2.4 percent YoY.

TCS announced a dividend of Rs 8 per share, which will be credited by August 3, 2022. The record date for the same is July 16, 2022.

IT services attrition continued to climb and was 19.7 percent on the last twelve months’ basis, the company said in an exchange filing. In the March quarter, it was at 17.4 percent. Net headcount addition - which many believe to be leading indicator of future demand - during the period was 14,136, much lower than 35,209 employees in previous quarter. The company gradually accelerated its return to office program in Q1, with about 20 percent of the workforce now working from office.

The deal win also declined to $8.2 billion during the quarter from $11.3 billion in the previous quarter. The firms said it added nine new clients to the $100 million+ band YoY and 19 clients to the $50 million+ band.

“We are starting the new fiscal year on a strong note, with all-round growth and strong deal wins across all our segments,” said Rajesh Gopinathan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, TCS. “Pipeline velocity and deal closures continue to be strong, but we remain vigilant given the macro-level uncertainties. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the resilience of technology spending and the secular tailwinds driving our growth.”

Net cash from operations was at Rs 10,810 crore – 114.1 percent of net income, the company said.

“It has been a challenging quarter from a cost management perspective. Our Q1 operating margin of 23.1 percent reflects the impact of our annual salary increase, the elevated cost of managing the talent churn and gradually normalizing travel expenses,” said Samir Seksaria, Chief Financial Officer, TCS.

“However, our longer-term cost structures and relative competitiveness remain unchanged, and position us well to continue on our profitable growth trajectory.”

Segment performance

TCS said growth during the quarter was led by Retail and CPG (25.1 percent), Communications & Media (19.6 percent), Manufacturing vertical (16.4 percent) and Technology & Services (16.4 percent). BFSI grew 13.9 percent, while Life Sciences and Healthcare grew 11.9 percent.

Region wise, North America led with 19.1 percent growth, continental Europe grew 12.1 percent and UK grew 12.6 percent. In emerging markets, India grew 20.8 percent, Asia Pacific grew 6.2 percent, Latin America grew 21.6 percent, and Middle East & Africa grew 3.2 percent, the firm said.",516,0.19877563118934632

The first earnings season for the financial year 2023 will kick start tomorrow and as has become customary over the past few quarters, India’s largest IT services provider Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will open the innings this time too.

Experts look forward to a healthy on-year revenue growth for the Indian IT services sector that was aided by a secular demand environment, healthy deal wins, and mergers and acquisitions. They expect a steady sequential USD-reported revenue growth but it may be affected by adverse cross-currency and seasonality for a few companies in the sector.

For the bellwether of Indian IT services sector, TCS, the expectation is that the company will report a consolidated revenue growth of 15-16 percent on-year and 4-5 percent on-quarter for the first quarter ended June 2022. The company is expected to log in consolidated revenues of Rs 55,600 crore for the quarter.

The consolidated profit after tax (PAT) for the largest Indian IT services company, is expected to rise by 10 percent on-year but is likely to remain flat on a sequential basis. TCS is expected to post a bottomline of Rs 9,800 crore.

The company had recorded a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,008 crore during the corresponding period of last financial year when its consolidated revenues stood at Rs 45,411 crore. TCS had registered a PAT of Rs 9,926 crore during January to March 2022 period on revenues of Rs 50,591 crore.

USD and constant currency revenues

Experts expect the dollar revenues for the company to grow by close to 11 percent on year and ~2 percent sequentially while constant currency (CC) revenues are expected to grow by 3.5 percent sequentially.

“We expect CC revenue growth of 3.7 percent QoQ (2.3 percent QoQ in USD) on strong momentum in digital transformation programs while we expect growth to be broad based across verticals”, a report from the brokerage firm Phillip Capital said.

A report from Emkay Research expect 2.1 percent sequential revenue growth in US dollar terms as its factors in 190 basis points cross-currency headwinds.

Service line revenue mix between change the business and run the business is likely to remain similar to global tech spending. “TCS has diversified its presence across verticals, geographies and service lines and is likely to be beneficiary of large cost-takeout deals and vendor consolidation deals,” a report from ICICI Securities said.

Margins

An uptick in wages and travel and visa costs is likely to impact the margins during the quarter both on a yearly and sequential basis.

The EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin is likely to dip 190 bps on-year and 140 bps on-quarter to 26 percent.

“Margins are expected to decline by 140 bps sequentially due to wage hikes, travel costs while supply side pressures are likely to be offset by the currency depreciation,” a report from Phillip Capital said.

The brokerage expects the EBIT margin to trip to 23.6 percent for the reported quarter compared to 25.5 percent during the same quarter a year ago and 25 percent in the quarter ended March 2022.

ICICI Securities has worked out an EBIT margin of 23.5 percent, while Motilal Oswal Financial Services forecasts it at 23.9 percent.

Key things to watch out for

The experts will be closely watching the management’s comments on the demand trends in key verticals like BFSI, Retail, Manufacturing and Communications along with the deal intake/pipeline in Q1. Another key parameter to watch out for will be the price environment considering high inflation and tight labor markets as well as margin outlook, supply side challenges and attrition.

Experts at Emkay Research will also be looking for updates on regional markets outlook, any impact on tech spending from higher energy prices, inflation and potential economic slowdown/recession and if there are any delay/deferral/cancellation of projects due to macro uncertainties, high inflation and supply chain disruptions.

However, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services, TCS remains best positioned to benefit from the long-term structural tailwinds in Tech Services and should see a relative pickup in growth as the base effect and increased aggression aid it.

TCS shares traded flat ahead of earnings on Friday. It was up 0.29 per cent on BSE.

Tata Consultancy Services on July 4 said that the punitive damages levied on the company in the EPIC Systems Corporation case in the US has been lowered to $140 million.

“The US District Court for Western District of Wisconsin passed an order reducing the jury award of punitive damages to $140 million and directed the Clerk of the Court to file an amended judgement accordingly,” TCS said in a stock exchange filing.

A trade secret lawsuit had been filed against TCS and Tata America International Corp by Epic System in 2014, in which the latter alleged the Tata group companies stole its intellectual property to develop its own product. Epic had alleged that TCS, which had been hired to implement healthcare software stole 6,000 files with a fake ID by posing as a staff member rather than a consultant.

TCS had been found guilty by a jury in 2016 and awarded damages of $940 million to Epic Systems. A year later, in October 2017, the Wisconsin court brought the compensatory and punitive damages down to $420 million — . $280 million in punitive damages and $140 in compensatory damages. The punitive damages were then held to be excessive after TCS appealed it with the US Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit, Chicago, and the trial court was told to reassess it. This punitive damage has now been reduced by the US District Court for Western District of Wisconsin to $140 million.

“TCS is legally advised that it has strong arguments in its favor before the Appeal Court and the Order on the punitive damages are not supported by the facts presented by TCS before the Trial Court. We have been advised that the Order and the Judgement (when issued) is appealable to the US Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit Chicago,” TCS said in the filing.

It claimed it did not “misuse or derive any benefit from EPIC’s documents” and will defend its position before the appeals court.",340,-0.859501451253891

Information technology (IT) companies will kick off the first-quarter earnings season in July amid expectations they will post strong revenue growth, offset by pressure on profit margins exerted by higher. wage costs. IT companies including Infosys and HCL Technologies are unlikely to change their full-year guidance despite concerns of a recession in the US and Europe, analysts said.

Major IT companies typically announce their earnings for the three months ended June in the first fortnight of July, with Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services leading the pack.

The earnings season follows a tumultuous quarter marked by worries over the Russia-Ukraine war, accelerating inflation and tightening of interest rates by global central banks to cool it, supply-chain disruptions, and tumbling financial markets.

IT stocks have fallen the most among sectors, with the Nifty IT index correcting 29 percent from its high in January. Higher valuations and rising fears of an economic slowdown, even recession, in the US and Europe, the biggest markets for IT companies, weighed on the sector.

On a sequential basis, IT companies are expected to post diverging results because of sequential factors although they are expected to report strong year-on-year growth, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report.

Infosys will lead the way with revenue growth of 4.5 percent on a sequential basis, followed by TCS at 3.6 percent, the securities firm said. Seasonal weakness will dampen growth at Tech Mahindra, Wipro, and HCL Technologies, which may report 2.4-2.8 percent constant currency growth in revenue quarter-on-quarter, it said.

Among mid-tier companies, Mphasis is expected to report a weak quarter because of a likely decline in Business Process Outsourcing (BPO business linked to mortgage origination and refinancing. L&T Infotech may report modest 3.1 percent growth due to lower pass-through revenue while Mindtree will lead the way.

Before this year's correction in the Nifty IT index, the sector had had a healthy run-up since the outbreak of the pandemic, benefiting from the increasing adoption of digital media by students and salaried individuals cooped up indoors because of lockdowns.

""As the probability of a recession in the US has increased, there are renewed concerns in some cases around a slowdown in discretionary IT spends and this, coupled with lofty valuations, has resulted in a downward adjustment in stock prices,"" Siddharth Mehta, founder, and investment chief at Bay Capital said.

Dhananjay Sinha, Managing Director, Head Strategist, and Economist - Equity Research at JM Financial Institutional Securities said the valuation of IT companies is now closer to fair value after the recent correction in their stock prices. Feedback from companies suggests that their revenue outlook is intact so far.

""There may be some downside due to an eventual recession. But it may be temporary as we see structural tailwinds for IT spending by US companies over the longer horizon. A potential recession or an economic slowdown could ease the wage cost pressure for Indian IT companies over time,"" he said.

Margin pressure

Tech companies have already been grappling with pressure on their operating profit margins exerted by rising employee costs in the face of growing attrition. Kotak said the margin pressure seems to have bottomed out.

""Companies are incurring high talent retention costs (retention bonus, out-of-cycle wage revision etc.). The challenge exists in India as well as onsite. This pressure will seep into margins; we forecast 70-400 bps YoY decline in EBIT margin across the coverage universe,"" Kotak said. EBIT is short for earnings before interest and tax.

On a sequential basis, the securities firm sees headwinds in the form of wage revision for Infosys, TCS and Tech Mahindra, an increase in travel costs across all companies and visa costs for many and a decline in utilization as companies crank up hiring of fresh graduates.

Optically, Kotak feels the rupee's depreciation against US dollar may seem positive, but cross-currency headwinds have ensured only a marginal tailwind in the quarter.

The US dollar appreciated 5 percent, 6.6 percent and 1.7 percent against the euro, British pound and the Australian dollar, respectively, while the rupee depreciated 4 percent against the US dollar.

""Earnings before interest and tax has bottomed out in our view and will improve for most in the subsequent quarters as most pressure points are already absorbed, while efficiencies in the form of a pyramid, subcontracting cost rationalization and utilization will kick in later. The recent wave of rupee depreciation could also help,"" said Kotak. the June and September quarters would represent the peak of margin pressure.

Guidance

Kotak expects Infosys to maintain full-year revenue growth guidance at 12-14 percent in constant currency terms and the EBIT margin band at 21-23 percent.

HCL Technologies is also likely to retain revenue growth and margin guidance of 12-14 percent and 18-20 percent, respectively while Wipro could guide for 2.5-4.5 percent revenue growth on a sequential basis (1-3 percent organic), Kotak said.

Key things to watch out for

Investors will closely follow new deal wins, companies' commentary on demand, attrition, and pricing.

Kotak expects companies to report robust new deal wins. On attrition, the firm said it is likely to be more than 20 percent across companies as they deal with a talent crunch in a buoyant demand environment.

Broadband India Forum (BFI) on June 27 asserted the policy guidelines for captive private 5G networks must be implemented in letter and spirit of Cabinet decision, and that any delay in implementing direct spectrum allocation will impact enterprises ""unfairly"", giving regulatory advantage to certain industry sections.

The enterprises should, in all fairness, be allowed their fundamental right to choose with whom they partner to set up their private captive networks, Broadband India Forum (BIF) said in a statement, adding, ""this choice should be available to them right from the beginning itself"".

Tech companies and telecom operators have clashed on the issue of captive private 5G networks, a lucrative business in fifth-generation services. Telcos have in the past argued that globally wherever 5G has been rolled out, there is hardly any consequent revenue increment seen from the retail segment, and the revenue and efficiency enhancement happens largely from the enterprise segment.

The Cabinet recently approved the auction of airwaves capable of offering fifth-generation or 5G telecom services, including ultra-high-speed internet, and gave its nod for setting up captive 5G networks by tech firms.

While the 5G spectrum in nine frequency bands will be auctioned to telecom operators like Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio, according to bid document, enterprises and tech firms — for the time being — will be allowed to take the 5G spectrum for their captive non-public network on lease from the telecom companies.

A direct allocation to enterprises will follow a demand study and sector regulator TRAI's recommendation on aspects, such as pricing and modalities of such allocation. BIF in a statement on June 27 cited reports to say it has come to understand that the government is initially considering to include only the framework for enterprises to set up private 5G networks in partnership with telecom operators, by taking spectrum on lease or by getting their networks.

""BIF feels that such an action, if taken, will provide a regulatory advantage to one side, more so since that side is already overly strong and has the advantages of huge external market power of an incumbent network, which directly impacts the businesses of the weak non-telecom vertical players, that is, enterprises,"" it said.

Taking note of certain media reports that policy guidelines that would allow setting up of captive private 5G networks is in the offing, BIF said it welcomes this progressive move by the government in the process of digital transformation for the nation and towards achieving ’Industry 4.0’.

To truly implement the Cabinet decision in letter and spirit, it might be appropriate to provide a suitably calibrated handicap to the enterprises to offset the disadvantage they face due to the ""privileged"" position that the other side holds, the industry body suggested.

The enterprises should be provided their fundamental right to choose with whom they partner to set up their private captive networks, and this choice should be available to them right from the start, argued BIF, whose members include tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Meta, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), among others.

BIF President T V Ramachandran said, ""If the mentioned media reports are taken to be true, these guidelines would surely distort competition and go against the essence of the Cabinet decision as well as the NIA (Notice Inviting Applications) dated June 15, 2022, wherein there was no indication that the options for incumbents to offer these services first were to be facilitated.”",570,0.3139504591623942

The IT major’s operating income was up 23% and came in at $2.6 billion, and its operating margin was at 16.1%. The company also reported its second-highest bookings of $17 billion. For 2022, it now expects revenue growth to be in the range of 25.5-26.5%, as compared to 24-26% previously.

For Q4, Accenture tempered its revenue forecast, and additionally, toned down its profit forecast for the 2022 fiscal (Accenture follows a September-August financial year).

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said in a statement: “Our very strong financial results for the third quarter reflect continued broad-based demand across markets, services, and industries, and the continued recognition of the outstanding talent of our 710,000 people. We continue to gain significant market share, and our services have never been more relevant as our clients turn to us as the trusted partner for the solutions they need to accelerate growth and become more resilient and efficient.”

The company expects its earnings per share for the fiscal to be in the range of $10.61 to $10.70, down from its previously estimated range of $10.61 to $10.81.

Amid worries of high inflation, Accenture said revenues for the quarter reflect a foreign-exchange impact of -5%, up from the -4% it previously forecast. For the fourth quarter, Accenture expects revenue to be in the range of $15 billion to $15.5 billion, assuming a -8% foreign-exchange impact as compared to the same period last year.

For the fiscal, Accenture said it now assumes foreign exchange impact to be -4.5% as compared to 2021. Previously, it had placed this at -3%.

Over half of Accenture’s revenues come from locations outside the United States, and with the dollar appreciating against other currencies, it dents profits of companies that have to convert the currencies of the countries they have operations in into dollars.

Accenture’s headcount for the quarter went up by 11,928, with voluntary attrition at 20%.

(Image credit: Facebook)

A court in Chennai has ordered Tata Consultancy Services to reinstate an employee it sacked in 2015 and pay him his salary and benefits of seven years in full, DT Next newspaper reported.

Thirumalai Selvan, 48, had worked for the information technology company for over 8 years before being let go in mass layoffs. TCS said his performance was not up to its expectations.

Selvan, who had a managerial position in TCS, was forced to look for freelance opportunities after being sacked. He earned less than Rs 10,000 per month working as a freelance software consultant and a real estate broker. His family depended on savings and his wife’s salary.

Adding to Selvan’s financial troubles were legal hassles. “I would have travelled to the court more than 150 times in the last seven years,” he told DT Next.

After a tedious seven years, the city labour court ruled in his favour. It refuted TCS’ argument that Selvan belonged to the managerial cadre and was not a workman -- someone with a specified skill.

“The reason for not mentioning the petitioner’s other duties is nothing but a subterfuge, to camouflage his principal nature of duty,” C Kumarappan, Principal Labour Court’s presiding officer said, according to DT Next.

The court observed that Selvan’s primary role was that of a skilled worker.

The Forum for IT Employees (FITE), that helped Selvan in his court case, celebrated the judgement.

“Justice anywhere is hope everywhere and a reminder to all who are forcing employees to resign,” the group was quoted as saying by the Federal website. “Great work done by Team FITE Chennai and salute to the TCS employee who fought for justice.”",306,-0.7796189188957214

Emkay Global Financial's report on TCS

As per our interaction with TCS management, the company does not see any softness in demand or any delay in decision-making from clients despite the uncertain macro environment. Management is confident of sustaining revenue growth momentum in the coming quarters. TCS indicated that the deal pipeline remains healthy with a good mix of small, medium and large deals. The company further indicated that the deal closure velocity remains steady and it is not witnessing delays in decision making. TCS signed deals worth USD34.6bn in FY22 (up ~10% YoY). Margins are expected to remain under pressure in H1FY23 on account of headwinds stemming from wage hikes (w.e.f Q1) and an uptick in travel and visa costs. Margins should improve in H2, driven by normalization of salary hikes, moderation in attrition and benefits accruing from better pricing.



Outlook

TCS is well poised to benefit from strong demand and growing digital transformation opportunities. Key concerns include salary inflation, currency volatility and a potential slowdown in US/Europe. We have a Buy rating with a TP of Rs4,000 at 28x Mar’24E EPS.

The market capitalisation (m-cap) of the top-10 most valued companies eroded by over Rs 2.29 lakh crore last week, with Life Insurance Corporation taking the biggest hit. On a weekly basis, the domestic equity benchmarks witnessed heavy selling.

The Sensex tumbled 1,465.79 points or 2.63 per cent, while the Nifty lost 382.50 points or 2.31 per cent as investors rushed to safer assets because elevated crude oil prices triggered inflation fears. On a weekly basis, the domestic equity benchmarks witnessed heavy selling.

Corporate major Reliance Industries' m-cap fell by Rs 44,311.19 crore to Rs 18,36,039.28 crore. IT bellwethers TCS and Infosys lost Rs 45,746.13 crore from their cumulative market cap. The valuation of TCS stood at Rs 12,31,398.85 crore, while that of Infosys was Rs 6,21,502.63 crore.

HDFC's valuation slipped by Rs 17,879.22 crore to Rs 3,95,420.14 crore. Telecom major Bharti Airtel also witnessed a dip of Rs 7,359.31 crore from its market valuation, which stood at Rs 3,69,613.44 crore.

In the ranking of top-10 firms, Reliance Industries retained the title of the most valued firm, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, Infosys, HUL, ICICI Bank, LIC, SBI, HDFC and Bharti Airtel.

In an attempt to widen and deepen the tax base, and to nudge taxpayers to furnish their income returns, Finance Act, 2021 introduced two new sections, 206AB and 206CCA, in the Income tax Act 1961 with effect from July 1, 2021.

Higher TDS non-IT return-filers

Section 206AB requires the deductor to withhold tax deducted at source (TDS) at higher of the following rates on payments made to “specified persons”: (i) at twice the rate specified in the relevant provision of the Act; or (ii) at twice the rate or rates in force; or (iii) at the rate of 5 percent.

The term “specified person” is further defined (as amended by Finance Act, 2022) to include the following:

(a) A person who has not furnished return of income for assessment year (AY) relevant to the previous year immediately prior to the financial year (FY) in which tax is required to be deducted. The previous year to be considered is the year for which the time limit for filing the return of income under section 139(1) has expired; and

(b)Aggregate tax deducted/collected is Rs 50,000 or more in the relevant previous year.

A specified person shall not include a non-resident (NR) who does not have a permanent establishment (PE) in India.

Section 206AB is not applicable to certain payments like salary, lottery, horse race winnings, etc. as specified in the provision. Similarly, section 206CCA was inserted to provide for higher rate of tax collected at source (TCS) for non-filers of income-tax return.

Also read: File income tax returns by the due date or pay double the TDS

Newly-introduced compliance check functionality

To ease the compliance burden of deductors and collectors, the tax department would make available a list of specified persons not meeting the conditions specified in sections 206AB and 206CCA of the Act to whom higher TDS rates will be applicable. Accordingly, a new functionality Compliance Check for Section 206AB & 206CCA has been introduced on the income tax reporting portal.

The list of specified persons for FY 2022-23 is prepared on the basis of the following:





It is prepared at the start of FY 2022-23 (taking the previous year 2020-21 as the relevant year) and the list will include: taxpayers who did not file return of income for FY 2020-21; and having aggregate TDS / TCS of Rs 50,000 or more during FY 2020-21.



No new names are added during the year.



If a person files and verifies his return of income for FY 2020-21/FY 2021-22 during FY 2022-23, his name would be removed from the list.



If aggregate TDS / TCS of the person is less than Rs. 50,000 during FY 2021-22, his name would be removed from the list.

Entities required to make payments can punch in the Permanent Account Number (PAN) of the relevant person / entity to whom payment(s) is to be made. If the name appears, then higher tax deduction/collection rate shall apply. A ‘bulk search’ option is also made available to the entities.

The list would be drawn afresh at the start of each FY in a similar manner. For example, let’s say ABC Ltd has to make payment to Mr A on April 20, 2022 (i.e., in FY 2022-23) and TDS is required to be deducted on the said payment. Accordingly, ABC Ltd. will have to check on the portal if Mr A is included in the list of specified persons. Mr A’s name will be reflected in the list if he has not: (a) Filed the tax return for FY 2020-21 (being the relevant previous year); and (b) Total tax deducted / collected is Rs 50,000 or more during the FY 2020-21.

However, if the payment is to be made after July 31, 2022, the relevant previous year will be FY 2021-22 as the timeline for filing the return of income for FY 2021-22 (which is July 31, 2022) has expired. Accordingly, ABC Ltd. will have to check if Mr. A’s name is removed or not from the list of specified persons while making the payment.

Non-filers should file tax returns on time

Non-filers of tax returns are required to file their tax returns within the due date to avoid deduction / collection of taxes at higher rates. Also, the compliance check facility is a welcome relief to deductors / collectors, who would otherwise be mandated to obtain a declaration from all applicable payees.

The market managed to settle the week ended May 27 with half-a-percent gains which witnessed a negative mood in the first three days, followed by a sharp recovery in the next two sessions of the week. The Nifty50 strongly defended the crucial 16,000 mark throughout last week and closed the near-critical hurdle of 16,400 levels.

Experts largely hope the index to remain in a broad range of 15,700-16,400 levels but if it decisively surpasses the upper band of the range, then there could be a possibility of the index moving towards 16,600-16,800 levels in the coming days. Further, if the market breadth turns stronger and global cues remain positive, then there could be further rally in the market, experts said.

The Nifty50 rallied 1.13 percent or 182 points to 16,352 on Friday and during the week, it gained half a percent, but the broader space underperformed frontliners as the Nifty Midcap 100 index fell 0.77 percent and Smallcap 100 index declined 3.4 percent during the week.

""In last three consecutive weeks, our markets made several attempts towards 15,900–15,700, but fortunately, despite unfavourable global environment, our market showed tremendous resilience at lower levels. In fact, with the last two days of smart recovery, our market seems to have weathered the storm, at least for the time being,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

Now, we are back to the higher end of the recent range i.e. 16,400 and it would be interesting to see whether the Nifty surpasses it or not. In our sense, it’s a matter of time and we would see the Nifty traversing this level to test 16,600–16,800 in current week, he said.

Despite all this, he feels we are still not completely out of the woods yet, because globally there is yet to stabilize things. Hence, he advises that traders not get complacent and should keep assessing situation on a regular basis.

As far as immediate supports are concerned, he said 16,200 followed by 16,000 should provide cushion on any intra-week weakness.

Here are top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on the May 27 closing prices:

Nandish Shah, Senior Derivative & Technical Analyst at HDFC Securities

VIP Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 559.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 510 | Target: Rs 630 | Return: 13 percent

Primary trend of stock is positive as it is trading above its 100 and 200 weeks moving averages. During the recent correction, stock price has taken support at the upward sloping trendline on the weekly chart.

Stock price has formed Bullish Hammer candle stick pattern on the weekly chart. It has formed triple bottom around Rs 515 levels on the daily chart suggesting strong support around that levels.

Mastek: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,448 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,350 | Target: Rs 2,650 | Return: 8 percent

Stock price has formed double bottom on the daily line chart. Short term trend of the stock turned bullish as it closed above its 5 days EMA (exponential moving average). Primary trend of the stock is positive as it is trading above its 100 and 200 weeks EMA.

It has corrected nearly 30 percent from the recent high and reached near support on the weekly chart. RSI (relative strength index) and MFI (money flow index) Oscillator has started sloping upwards, suggesting higher probability of bullish trend reversal in the stock price in the coming days.

DCB Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 82.7 | Stop-Loss: Rs 78 | Target: Rs 92 | Return: 11 percent

Short term trend of the stock is bullish as it is trading above its 5 and 20 weeks EMA. Stock price is on the verge of breaking out from the symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart.

RSI oscillator has bounced back from the 30 odd levels and started rising, suggesting higher possibility of bullish trend reversal in stock price in the coming days.

Bank Nifty has broken out from the downward sloping trendline and we expect bullishness to spill over in the midcap banking stocks in the days to come.

Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Tech Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,123.25 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,045 | Target: Rs 1,250 | Return: 11 percent

The IT space has witnessed a decent correction from their highs and Tech Mahindra, too, has corrected sharply along with its peers. However, prices have reached its important support where we can observe a harmonic pattern called AB=CD where two alternate moves are equal in length. This coincides around the support end of a Falling Channel and also the ‘RSI Smoothened oscillator has given a positive crossover from its oversold zone.

The upmove in last couple of sessions from its support indicates probability of a pullback move in the short term.

Hence, traders should look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 1,125-1,115 for potential targets of Rs 1,190 and Rs 1,250 in the near term. The stop-loss on long positions should be placed below Rs 1,045.

Ambuja Cements: Buy | LTP: Rs 366.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 357 | Target: Rs 379 | Return: 3.5 percent

In the recent market corrective phase, this stock has shown a relative outperformance and has seen a time-wise correction rather than any price correction. From the lows of March 8, the recent upmove seems to be a five wave ‘Impulsive’ upmove in which prices are trading within ‘wave 4’.

The stock has formed a triangle in this consolidation and looking at the price volumes structure and the RSI oscillator, we expect a breakout in the stock soon which would be the fifth wave of this impulse.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 365-362 for potential targets of Rs 372 and Rs 379 in the near term. The stop-loss for long positions can be placed below Rs 357.

Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Muthoot Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,096.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,020 | Target: Rs 1,200 | Return: 9.5 percent

The stock has formed a bullish reversal formation on a daily chart. It has formed a “Gravestone Doji” after hitting the important support level based on the Fibonacci retracement.

Also it’s a volume-based price reversal formation, which should favour bulls heavily in the near term. It's a buy at current levels and more on dips around Rs 1,060 with a final stop-loss at Rs 1,020. On the higher side, it would face major resistance at Rs 1,150 and at Rs 1,250.

BHEL: Buy | LTP: Rs 51.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 47 | Target: Rs 59 | Return: 15 percent

It has formed a double bottom in the critical support zone. The last several times, it has relied on Rs 44-45 and has bounced back in a hurry.

To validate the formation, the stock must definitely cross the level of Rs 59, which is far from the current level.

Over the past two days, the stock has been rapidly reversing back to Rs 47-48, indicating that the stock is poised to move towards Rs 59 in the near term. We should be buyers at the current level and fall further around Rs 48 with a final stop-loss at Rs 47.

TCS: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,261.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,100 | Target: Rs 3,600 | Return: 10.4 percent

The stock has completed a corrective pattern on Rs 3,154 levels, however, a sharp recovery is missing due to weakness in the entire sector. As the stock completed a major corrective pattern, investors should be buyers at current levels (Rs 3,265).

It is giving a decent risk-reward ratio for medium-term investors. On the upside, it has the biggest hurdles at Rs 3,400 and Rs 3,600. Keep stop-loss at Rs 3,100 on a closing basis.

Ajit Mishra, VP-Research at Religare Broking

Ambuja Cements: Buy | LTP: Rs 366.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 348 | Target: Rs 390 | Return: 6.5 percent

We’re seeing a mixed trend within the cement space and Ambuja Cements is currently seeing consolidation. It’s hovering in a tight range while holding firmly above the support zone of the major moving averages (100,200 EMA).

The chart pattern indicates a strong directional move soon. We thus recommend accumulating within Rs 362-366 levels.

Hero MotoCorp: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,719.80 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,600 | Target: Rs 2,900 | Return: 7 percent

The auto pack has been performing well within the sectoral pack and Hero MotoCorp is performing in line with the trend. It has witnessed a fresh breakout from a declining broadening formation on the daily chart and is likely to maintain the prevailing momentum.

We recommend initiating fresh longs within Rs 2,690-2,710 levels.

Havells India June Futures: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,182.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,220 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Return: 7 percent

Havells has been trading with corrective bias since December 2021 and gradually drifting lower. After retesting the trend line hurdle, it was hovering in a narrow range around the major moving averages on the daily chart and witnessed a fresh breakdown of late.

We thus recommend creating shorts within Rs 1,185-1,195 zone.

The apex court had upheld the removal of Mistry from the board. Mistry had alleged oppression of minority shareholders and cited his removal as an instance. Rejecting the case, the apex court said business decisions gone wrong cannot be viewed as prejudice against minority shareholders.

The brokerage firm says the Indian IT growth was accelerating till the third quarter of 2022 and has begun to slow down from the fourth quarter, which is likely to worsen into FY23 from tougher comps, supply issues and eventually a worsening macro. With peak sector growth behind, growth deceleration should continue to weigh on sector multiples.

""Rising margin headwinds in the near term and revenue headwinds in the medium term from a potential macro slowdown will mean that the sector’s earnings upgrade cycle is behind,"" JP Morgan said in its report.

""We see peak revenue growth behind us and EBIT margins trending down from inflation, mean reversion. While the bottom-up outlook remains positive from most Services, Software and SaaS names YTD, and the tech spending cycle remains buoyant structurally, we feel there are more downside risks to current earnings assumptions,"" the brokerage firm said.

The Nifty IT Index have underperformed the NIFTY by 15 percent so far this year as the earnings outlook has worsened over the current earnings season.

The brokerage firm has downgraded Tata Consultancy Services, HCL Technology, Wipro and L&T Technology to underweight from neutral and cut its target price by 15-21 percent.

""Indian tech services are the most expensive services names globally at a premium to digital native peers and Accenture, and at par with enterprise software that appears unsustainable. Sector reverse DCFs suggest that the market is still baking in 6-13 percent growth for Tier 1s and 14-33% for midcaps over the next decade; that seems optimistic given this remains a late cyclical sector for most names,"" the JP Morgan report said.

Over the past two years, lockdowns and restrictions continued to disrupt our lives. But tough times couldn’t deter us from exercise and sports. More than ever, we found time for activities like yoga and weight training at home and as soon as the world unlocked, running, cycling, walking and other fitness activities became a routine and much needed break from virtual meets. After two years, many sporting events have returned with spectators and participative events flagging off as per schedule with participants returning with revenge. For runners particularly, the highlight of the year is the return of major running events. One such event was the TCS World 10K that took place recently.

The event saw close to 20,000 runners take to the streets of Bengaluru with participation from across the country and some international runners as well. Many came to catch up with their running buddies after a gap of two years, while many others came with determination to race and compete, achieve their personal running goals that had been postponed. The excitement was palpable at the start line, during the race and post the event. A part of all this action were many brands who were present on ground.

Being the title sponsor of this event which is also one of the biggest 10 K events in the world, TCS’s logo was splashed across the city of Bengaluru. Ahead of the event, Storyboard18 caught up with Rajashree R, chief marketing officer of TCS, to gauge the excitement around the event. She spoke about how when it comes to running, there is no other brand that has dominated a sport like TCS.

In the year 2021 itself, the brand added the TCS London Marathon and the Waterfront Marathon to its roster of 11 running sponsorships including the highly popular TCS New York City Marathon. In the year gone by, the IT major also announced a partnership for the Jaguar TCS racing team and Formula-E motorsports and also made its way into the field of golf by partnering with the Dutch Open.

In an exclusive conversation as part of Storyboard18’s month in focus - Just Sports, Rajashree R shares the brand’s approach when it comes to sponsorships. Edited excerpts:

You have title sponsored events across different markets now. New York and London, which are World Marathon Majors. Then Amsterdam, Toronto and Bengaluru and many events that you associate with as a technology partner. How exactly do you choose these events? What is the deciding factor?

If you look at the recent past, you would have hardly seen a brand dominate a sport as we do with marathons. Brands sponsor an off football game or an odd tennis event. But we are today a primary source behind marathons. We are sponsoring around 14 marathons across the world. Right from Canberra to Amsterdam to London. As a runner you would know, New York and London are the top billing marathons in the world. It is a reflection of that and of course this is where our customers are, our own employees are. It is a no brainer, if you ask me.

Some of these sponsorships and partnerships are up for renewal after a few years. What keeps you interested?

It is a long-term commitment for us. The good thing about a marathon is that it is a very inclusive sport. You look at some of the other sports, they are not as inclusive as a marathon is. You see millions of runners wearing a TCS badge and running on the Brooklyn bridge, it gives you goosebumps! Not just as a ‘TCSer’ but also as an Indian. The fact that it brings a city together, it brings common man together I think is very exciting for us as a brand. I am waiting to see the London Marathon because this is the first time we would have the title sponsorship. So, these are goosebumps moments for all of us and we are deeply committed to the cause.

As you mentioned TCS’ new role is that of the title partner for the upcoming London Marathon. What are the big plans there?

For me, if you say New York, London and Mumbai, I think you have covered the world. Very excited about the London opportunity. It is a gorgeous marathon. It goes through the parks of London. It is a historic marathon as well, one of the oldest marathons out there. The UK is a very important market for us. It is a market where we are the No.1 technology service provider, so bringing our customers, our employees and the larger ecosystem to this platform is very exciting and to us, it is not just about customers but our own employees as well. Because every year through these sponsorships more than 6000 employees also run. We sponsor 6,000 employees to participate in these marathons.

Earlier you mentioned how you have dominated this sport of marathons. But now you are also getting into other sports such as Formula E team or the Dutch Open for Golf. What is the strategy and approach there?

For us, sport in general is a great association for the brand. Because when you are a sports person that’s when you push yourself as a human to its maximum. And any place where technology is helping humans to do better is the intersection that we love. So whether it is running or the use of technology or the use of the app, giving runners the guidance to do the training, helping them do better is an exciting area.

Motorsport was interesting to us especially. The EV opportunity again is an area where we believe our future lies. We all know our future lies with EV. We want to be a part of that journey. And Formula E is at the pinnacle of it because the kind of research that happens on the sidelines of Formula E really drives the road map for electric vehicles in the future. Jaguar being a fantastic brand for us to be associated with. We are not just a sponsor, we are a partner to Jaguar. We have a large relationship with Jaguar as well. So we are working very closely with them on the vehicle, helping the drivers with technology and so on. The reason we got on to it was that it allowed us to use our technology strength for drivers to do better and also the greater cause of EV as our future. So that intersection was very exciting for us and that is why we got on board.

Rajashree R, chief marketing officer of TCS.

Earlier this year, TCS was declared the second most valuable information technology company globally by a Brand Finance report. What has been the contribution of sports sponsorships to help achieve this global brand positioning?

It has been pivotal. I think we are probably one of the first brands to have the global platform as far as sponsorships is concerned. We can now see other Indian brands joining the bandwagon, which is good. It has definitely helped us to take the brand forward. Having that kind of strong presence in some of the marquee markets where we operate has been really very pivotal in gaining brand value. In fact, if you look at the narration of the brand value when we got the report, they actually rated the sports sponsorships as a key driver to achieve this brand value. And very importantly, it is not just about that day, we do a lot of things around the sponsorships. For example, in New York, we do something called team TCS for teachers, so we got a cohort of teachers who we are sponsoring to run the New York Marathon. As we know during the pandemic the teaching community was affected. So we are supporting a lot of initiatives around the sidelines of the marathon.

With the Council of responsible sport you have recently launched an app called ‘Rescore’ that will help organizers for a more sustainable organization of their events. Can you share a bit more about it and how will it work?

I am very proud of it. When running events happen there is a lot of waste that gets generated. Today we know that people want things that are more sustainable. Lot of these runners want to lead a sustainable life and not contribute to any waste. This app that we have done with the Council of Responsible Sport is a full dashboard which is used by the event organizers to measure various factors which contribute to the lack of sustainably, like lot of wastage, use of power, use of fuel. A lot of factors which they can themselves measure on how green and sustainable this event is and the app is completely free. It is really beautiful because when you run a marathon, you will be happy to know that you are running a sustainable marathon.

Indian IT stocks fell even as the rupee hit an all-time low as larger concerns weighed on them.

All the top IT stocks ended lower on Tuesday. Infosys dropped 1.1 percent, Tata Consultancy Services lost 0.2 percent, HCL Technologies lost 0.3 percent and Wipro declined 1.14 percent on the National Stock Exchange on May 10. The Nifty IT index fell 1 percent.

The Nifty IT index has slipped 3% in May so far. Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro, and HCL Tech have lost 7-19 percent in this period.

So far this year, the Nifty IT Index has fallen 21 percent, while the rupee has declined about 4 percent. Infosys, TCS, Wipro, and HCL Tech lost between 7 and 33 percent this year.

Technology investors typically cheer a weakening rupee, which increases earnings when dollar revenue is converted into the local currency. Every 1 percent depreciation in the rupee boosts the margins of IT companies by 14-40 basis points, analysts said.

In the March quarter, dollar revenue at TCS grew 14.3 percent in constant currency terms from a year earlier to $6.7 billion, while that of Infosys increased 20.6 percent to $4.3 billion. Wipro’s dollar revenue grew 3.1 percent sequentially to $2.72 billion.

According to ICRA, TCS, Wipro, HCL, Tech Mahindra and Infosys reported a good performance in the fourth quarter of FY22. There has been some moderation in operating margins over the past few quarters, driven by wage cost inflation on the back of demand-supply gaps and high attrition levels, and also due to normalisation of operational overheads with the resumption of work-from-office to a large extent. However, overall profitability and accrual generation has remained healthy.

Contract deferrals

“Global macroeconomic factors including uncertainty related to the ongoing geopolitical issues between Russia and Ukraine are likely to have some impact on IT services companies with considerable presence in Eastern Europe,” said Deepak Jotwani, assistant vice president & sector head - corporate ratings at ICRA.

“However, the overall impact on the industry performance is not expected to be significant. While there could be slight deferrals in contract awards/IT investments in select geographies, overall technology spend is likely to remain healthy across key geographies.”

Analysts expect Indian IT service companies to report steady growth of 10-12 percent over FY23 and FY24, supported by accelerated demand for digitisation globally. However margin pressure is likely to sustain over the near term, although abated to some extent by increasing operational efficiencies.

Volatility in the global markets amid higher inflation and expectations of tightening by central banks along with the Russia-Ukraine war, which is unlikely to end soon, may see a slowdown in order books. Most Indian IT companies are moving their operations out of Russia while helping clients maintain business continuity by shifting work to other locations. This is likely to increase margin pressures further, analysts said.

“Monetary tightening by the Reserve Bank of India or the US Federal Reserve will have a negative effect on IT services top line and margins only if it results in a sharp slowdown in economic activity or a recession,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities. “IT projects cannot be postponed by businesses if they want to maintain their edge against competitors. However, in times of a sharp slowdown or recession, businesses across the board could postpone such spends.”

According to Ajit Mishra, VP of research at Religare Broking, broadly, the IT results in the March quarter were mixed – the order pipeline stood strong while margins were a bit impacted due to high attrition and employee costs. Besides, a sharp fall in global IT majors adds to the pressure. However, Religare’s long-term view on the IT sector is still positive, given the strong order pipeline and continuous demand for cloud and digitalisation across verticals.",639,-0.04513605282856868

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on April 25 announced the expansion of its strategic partnership with SBI Card to revamp its digital experience.

""TCS will further digitalize and transform the online onboarding processes to enable a faster turnaround and frictionless experience which is expected to drive greater customer satisfaction,"" the company said in a stock exchange filing.

""In addition, it will enable SBI Card to further expand its e-card issuance, delighting end customers and giving it a competitive edge in the market.""

In the run-up to SBI Card’s IPO in 2020, TCS had helped the company transform its core cards sourcing platform and digitized a significant portion of the process.

During the COVID-19 crisis, TCS worked closely with SBI Card to implement video KYC and e-signature features to fully digitalize its cards sourcing process.

Top three IT majors – TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech – made a net addition of 1.97 lakh employees for the year ending March 2022. The companies also added 2.08 lakh freshers for the year, and will be taking in 1.35 lakh campus hires this financial year.

This comes on the back of rising attrition even as demand continues to be robust. Moreover, with lateral talents coming at a huge cost, the companies are bridging the demand-supply gap by hiring more freshers.

According to experts and executives, attrition is likely to increase before it moderates in the second half this financial year.

Rising attrition

Spiking attrition rate has been a concern for IT companies.

TCS attrition increased to 17.4 percent in the March 2022 quarter from 8.6 percent in the beginning of the year and 11.9 percent in the December 2021 quarter. Infosys reported 27.7 percent in attrition for the March 2022 quarter, up from 13.9 percent at the beginning of the year.

In case of HCL Tech, attrition increased from 11.8 percent at the beginning of the year to 21.8 percent in the March 2022 quarter. Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive of TCS, said that the attrition numbers are likely to get worse before they moderate.

According to Infosys finance chief Nilanjan Roy, attrition should come down in the following year as more freshers come into the pipeline.

However, the increasing cost of talent is resulting in IT firms hiring more freshers in FY22, a trend that is likely to continue in FY23. TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech added 103546, 54396 and 39900 people last fiscal, respectively.

Fresher hiring

The top three IT firms consistently ramped up fresher supply from their initial estimates. For instance, TCS and Infosys hired 100,000 and 85,000 respectively against their initial estimates of 40,000 and 26,000 at the beginning of the fiscal.

For HCL Tech, the 23,000 freshers the firm hired was more than the 12,000 hired in the previous year.

In FY23, these companies will be hiring 1.35 lakh from campuses, and this number could increase.

TCS’ Gopinathan said, “The expectation is that the bulk of this hiring that has gone on across the industry in the last calendar year will start coming in and playing a role. So, it’s very similar to what you are saying; just that there is a little bit of a lag and by the middle of the year we should see it.”

He added that fresher hiring and productive use of freshers is a long cycle activity. “But you have seen the industry step up hiring over the last four quarters. We expect that as supply hits productive use it will ease up a lot of what was going on over the last few quarters.”

Roy said, “Volume has to be through freshers, there is no other source of volume. Therefore, we start pumping in more freshers, send them for training, put them into the bench and then get them into production. I think that cycle takes time, and you are already seeing the benefits of this – not only with us but also seeing that with the industry as well.”

In case of HCL Tech, apart from increasing the fresher supply to 45,000 in FY23, the company is also tapping into talents in other regions. It also expects the talent situation to stabilise by the second half of FY23.

During the earnings call on April 21, C Vijayakumar, chief executive of HCL Tech, said that it is also looking to tap the US and Asia Pacific for talents apart from India.",606,-0.23823952674865723

India's largest software exporter TCS on Friday said it aims to become the topmost IT services company in the world, asserting that it does not ""fear"" its large-scale operation is hindering the firm's ambitions. Speaking at the Times Network India Economic Conclave, Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive and managing director of the company with $25 billion in revenues and six lakh employees, said there is no reason for the company not to aspire to double, triple, or quadruple the revenues from the current levels.

""Absolutely, in many ways we already are"", Gopinathan said, without giving a timeline, while answering a question on whether he sees TCS becoming the largest IT company in the world. He said the company, which is the biggest IT services provider to the banking, financial services and insurance sector, comes a close second on employee count and has had instances of topping the global market capitalisation tables as well.

""Today we are $25 billion in size. There are many companies that are $50, $100 billion in size. There is no reason we shouldn't aspire to be double, triple, quadruple of the size we are today. The question is how do we go about it, what should we do right towards it? But the opportunity is unbounded. Both on demand and supply-side we are sitting in a sweet spot,"" he said.

""Our aspiration in no way should be constrained to where we are today, we should be aspiring to set new standards and we are far away from where the current standards itself are. (There is) huge headroom to still go forward,"" he added.

The comments from the TCS chief are significant because this means that the Tata Group would displace Accenture which had reported over $50 billion in revenue last year. A few weeks ago, TCS had said that it is targeting for revenues to touch $50 billion by 2030. Gopinathan said that back in 2001, the company had set a target of breaking into the top-10 in the world on multiple parameters and adopted specific way of working towards the goal.

Admitting that there is scepticism about a company being too big every time a boundary of scale is broken, Gopinathan pointed out that companies in the supply chain or logistics and consumer packaged goods segment have successfully managed to keep on bettering on their performance. About having a large base of over 6 lakh employees, Gopinathan said, ""We are approaching it very systematically. I don't have any fear that we are at the limit or near the limit of what can be achieved. The focus for us is to structure ourselves to be able to manage the scale and leverage the scale to our advantage, both of which we are doing quite well.""

TCS which is witnessing attrition levels of around 17 percent, amid heavy demand for talent which has seen quite a few companies surpassing 20 percent attrition level, has been able to command staff loyalty because it recognises that the talent is its biggest strength and is true to its word on all counts. ""There are no legacy people, only legacy technologies. By continuing to train people, providing them with first right of refusal for all new opportunities to our existing people, we have been able to systematically, and in a sustainable way, manage the multiple transitions that the industry sees and the pace of change that the industry sees. this is the magic sauce (for loyalty),"" he said.

He said periods of volatility like the current one because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine are natural phenomena for a business like theirs but the key for the company is to be close to the customer, helping them in their hour of need and invest in what will be required in the future so that it forms long relationships.

Yuvika (name changed) spends about three hours commuting during peak traffic hours in Bengaluru. The 25-year-old senior software developer recently returned to her office at Manyata Tech Park after working from home in Kengeri, about 35 km away, for two years.

“For people like me who live with their families in houses that are far from their office locations, it is very difficult to relocate to a paying guest facility near the office,” Yuvika said. “I have no choice but to travel, which is both expensive and time-consuming.”

IBM, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services, PayU, and startups, including Zeta and StayVista, have started opening up to varying degrees after two years of restrictions on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. Once again, the lives of employees like Yuvika who had settled into a work-from-home mode are being disrupted.

Diksha (name changed), an employee at a global multinational technology company, lived in Bengaluru with her husband and mother-in-law. During the pandemic, she shifted to her hometown and had a son, who is now a year old.

“For moving back to Bangalore, the biggest issue is childcare,” Diksha said. “For the past year, my son has had the habit of staying with us 24x7. It will be a big change for him and us alike.”

In her hometown, Diksha has a lot of family support. It is also where her son has stayed since he was born.

Many employees of such companies come from smaller towns. With the sudden shift to work from home in 2020, most of them moved to their hometowns to save on rent and be close to family. Now, with the pandemic appearing to be waning, it’s time to get back to the office. To help with the transition, many companies have provided time until June or July for physical attendance.

“We are working to make this a smooth transition,” said Priya Cherian, Chief People Officer of PayU, a payment service provider. “The months from March to May will be a transition period to help employees who have left the city in which the office was based and moved to their hometowns, plan and prepare for the hybrid model. Moreover, we are putting together additional resources to support our teams through this transition.”

IBM has a similar buffer period, although it maintains that the office location is mentioned in employment contracts and staffers are obligated to join when they are called back.

“IBM will not prescribe that our employees be in the office a certain number of days and at home a certain number of days,” said Thirukkumaran Nagarajan, head of human resources at IBM India/South Asia, without responding to a specific query on the contractual obligations. “Managers are designing what works best for their teams and client requirements.”

According to Nagarajan, even when employees come to the office, they spend only a few hours in meetings and work for a particular outcome. “There is no longer a scenario that anyone must come to the office just to do their everyday work,” he said.

Other options

Apart from the grace period to return to the office, a solution that has been discussed is to set up satellite offices in small towns. While this option will keep people closer to their families, satellite offices will also help reduce urban congestion and lower costs for companies.

IBM recently announced plans to expand into central India, Kochi, Ahmedabad, and suburbs of cities such as Hyderabad.

“We are now going where the talent pools of the country are… Having work locations beyond the metros will help us address growing client requirements as well as provide flexibility for our employees, in addition to gaining access to the talent and skillsets in these cities,” Nagarajan said.

Accenture, TCS, Infosys, and Wipro are reported to have earmarked funds or are planning to open offices in Jaipur, Coimbatore, Indore, Nagpur, and Visakhapatnam.

Zoho said in March last year it would open satellite offices, which seat 20 to 30 employees, in rural and non-urban areas. In September, Zoho said it plans to hire about 2,000 people for its rural offices by December end.

While opening satellite offices in the smaller towns might take some time, companies that are opening now are looking for ways to lure employees back.

Incentives to return

Amulya Nidhi recently joined Mumbai-based banking technology company Zeta as a people operations specialist. With his wife working in Pune, Nidhi operated from their house in the city until two months ago. On being called to work from the office, he moved to Mumbai, where his home is about 40 km from his work location. That’s a lot of commuting, both internally in Mumbai and back and forth from Pune.

“I genuinely think working from home is better for productivity,” Nidhi said. However, he also said neither extreme is good as employees need to interact and socialise and policymakers need to strike a balance between both.

“For the past couple of weeks, I went to the office and I'll be working from home for the next two weeks,” he said. “With the amount of commuting I need to do, the flexibility of the current hybrid policy is working best for me right now.”

Most companies offer a flexible hybrid work policy.

“Wipro has adopted a flexible, hybrid approach in our return-to-office policy,” the Bengaluru-based IT company said. “Since April 4, 2022, fully vaccinated employees have had the option to work from our India campuses, thrice a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.”

It is crucial to see how long these companies provide such work flexibility.

Startups including Zeta are developing individual policies to help their employees, from providing monetary assistance in commuting by partnering with Ola to relocating within a city or from a different city.

“The company helps people with registered brokers, in payment of a deposit and setting up their house like providing basic furniture and so on,” Nidhi said.

Zeta has also opened up its canteen facility and three to four well-known restaurants have started counters there for employees.

“These are the developments of the past one and a half years since the restrictions have slowly started lifting,” Nidhi said.

After the disruption caused by the pandemic, work from home became the new routine for most employees over the past two years. Going back to the old routine could be equally unsettling.

Companies are trying to make the transition easy. Mumbai-based luxury villa rental platform StayVista called its employees to the office and allowed them to wear the clothes they generally wore while working from home. Employees showed up in pyjamas, shorts, and comfortable slippers.

“Other than being a great way to bond as a team, the concept helped raise awareness on how critical it is for all organisations to thoughtfully make a smooth transition back to the office,” StayVista said. “Team members have got used to certain aspects of WFH (work from home) and want it to continue. The workplace will also have to adapt to these preferences.”

StayVista has also been screening Indian Premier League cricket matches in the evening for teams to watch together. “We emphasise the importance of team productivity that the back-to-office environment promotes, as opposed to individual productivity which comes with working remotely,” the company added.

Suraj Moraje, Former Chief Executive Officer of QuessCorp, a leading staffing and managed outsourcing services provider, pitched in on why are companies going out of their way to bring employees back. He said, “In the last couple of years, with a huge spurt in technology and investment coming into various industries, we're seeing huge amounts of demand for certain skill sets.”

He believes that with people working from home and a series of lockdowns, we are seeing an unprecedented shortage of labour. He said, “With attrition going up and a spike in demand for talent, companies are soft-pedaling and trying to see how they can get people back rather than mandating them to come back.”

He argued that had there been a market where there was a shortage of jobs, we would have seen a very different dynamic.

Why bring employees back to the office?

“To build culture and aid productivity” – that’s the standard answer from most companies when asked why they want employees back in the office or the hybrid work model now that the world has adapted to working from home.

Another reason cited by a source is the lease that companies have to pay for office premises, which has become an unproductive fixed cost and affects their profit and loss accounts.

Moraje, an industry veteran, said, “It is difficult to get mentorship, build networks, and have unstructured, spontaneous conversations if you're not at the workplace.”

He believes that employees can work from home completely for a couple of years. However, if one’s job involves an innovation element to it, they will have to come back to the office to support the transformational aspects of their work.

Secondly, Moraje said that with remote working, companies are facing an issue with freshers who are struggling to fit into the work culture. He added, “I get a laptop and office goodies, with that I don’t know how I am supposed to understand what it means to work there.”

He believes this disconnection from the work culture is contributing to the surge in attrition and decline in loyalty to work.

Silver lining

While returning to the office might not be desirable for some, it’s not all bad either.

Some say a hybrid work model where they go to the office for a few days a week might help their mental health.

“During work from home, my routine became monotonous as I was living alone and I had nothing else to do,” said Neha Nupur, an employee of Wipro. “In an office environment, I have my colleagues around and have someone to talk to, share my thoughts, and discuss my problems. It helps me keep my mental health in check.”

The conversations around work models are evolving and there are 101 approaches to the issue. However, it’s clear that there is a need to strike a balance between socialising and isolation. A hybrid work model can probably help employees achieve that.",1779,-0.02477433000292097

Shares of information technology (IT) companies slumped on Monday after Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services posted lacklustre earnings for the March quarter.

Shares of Infosys lost 8 percent, its biggest slump since March 2020, Mastek Ltd dropped 7 percent, Mindtree Ltd 6.4 percent, Mphasis 6 percent, Tech Mahindra Ltd 5.6 percent, Tata Elxsi 5.4 percent, BirlaSoft 5.3 percent, KPIT Tech 5 percent, Wipro Ltd 4 percent, Zensar Tech 3.7 percent, TCS 3.5 percent, HCL Technologies 3.4 percent, Cyient 3.3 percent.

The BSE IT Index fell 5.2 percent - its steepest fall since April 2020.

Earlier, analysts predicted IT firms to report robust revenue growth, with mid-cap companies expected to outperform their larger rivals.

Investors are also dumping IT stocks globally as, analysts say, anticipating aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to combat a multi-year-high inflation in the US. ""Rise in interest rates would slow down several economies where IT companies operate and hence expect to see some impact on their business performance,"" said Vishnu Kapadia, Chief Investment Officer at MJK Investments.

""Equity valuations are inversely proportional to interest rates and hence it is going to be an interesting period ahead given how not just the US Fed but central banks across the world are going on a tightening cycle given the twin problems of out-of-control inflation and supply shocks.""

TCS and Infosys reported lower-than-expected earnings with weaker margins. TCS margins stood at 25 percent flat on-quarter and down 189 basis points on-year due to price hikes amid high attrition.

Brokerage firm Reliance Securities expects FY23 margins to get impacted because of higher selling, general and administrative expenses (higher attrition and resumption of offices) and accelerated hiring over the next two quarters. ""Favourable currency and better pricing, along with scale would nullify the impact. We forecast the margin to remain in the range of 25.1-26 percent over FY23-FY24,"" it said.

Infosys margin was down 193 basis points QoQ at 21.6 percent. It was because of higher-than-expected pass-through costs (90bps margin hit), higher employee costs (30bps margin hit), and rise in travel costs (30bps margin hit). The company's management highlighted that while the quarterly annualised attrition was down 5 percentage points in the fourth quarter, wage hikes in FY23 could be competitive and higher than last year particularly overseas.

Jefferies India cut the Infosys margin estimates by 100-170 basis points to factor the miss and expected 21.9 percent margin in FY22. The brokerage firm Nomura Research expects FY23 EBIT margin to drop 100 basis points year-on-year to 22 percent and lower FY22-24 earnings per share by 5-7 percent primarily on our lower margin expectations. B&K Securities assume margins of 22.7/23.7 percent for FY23/24 and hence downgraded the EPS estimates by 5 percent each year to Rs. 63/78 per share respectively.

""The downfall in IT stocks is triggered by the weak Infosys Q4 results. It has prompted industry-wide concerns like high attrition, wage inflation, lower utilisation, and cut-down of IT spending by industries due to geopolitical and macroeconomic issues. The sharp correction was triggered because the industry was trading at premium valuations and concerns over downgrade in future earnings growth,"" said Sethumadhavan KS, Research Analyst at Geojit Financial Services.",539,-0.6327094002203508

Top two infotech majors TCS and Infosys ramped up fresher recruitments three times in the year ended March 31 to a record of over 1.85 lakh as demand for technologies in the wake of the pandemic peaked and enterprises across the world shifted to digital for business continuity.

With companies fighting for a limited talent pool, attrition has also been on the rise for the last three quarters and hence supply side crunch has become a huge challenge for the firms.

Indian IT firms are looking to tackle this challenge by hiring a large number of freshers.

A case in point is the fresher hiring by TCS and Infosys. The companies made 40,000 and 21,000 campus hires in FY21. This has increased multifold in FY22 and is likely to continue. TCS and Infosys hired 100,000 and 85,000 freshers respectively in FY22.

Infosys CEO & MD Salil Parekh said that the company is looking at hiring 50,000 freshers in FY23 but could step up during the course of the year. In FY22, after the initial hiring outlook of 26,000, it stepped up the fresher hiring every quarter.

TCS shared a similar sentiment. NG Subramaniam, operations chief at TCS, said that the company is starting the year with a hiring target of 40,000 and will step it up if need be during the year.

However, rising attrition continues to raise concerns for the firms.

Rising attrition

TCS attrition increased to 17.4 percent in the quarter from 8.6 percent in the beginning of the year and 11.9 percent in the December 2021 quarter. Infosys reported 27.7 percent in attrition, up from 13.9 percent at the beginning of the year.

Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and MD, TCS, said that the attrition numbers are likely to get worse before they moderate.

Parekh said that the initiatives the company has put in place such as employee engagement, career progression, compensation, and rotation of work are starting to have an impact.

However, margins have come under pressure. Infosys’ margins dipped 21.6 percent, below the market estimates of 23 percent. TCS too indicated near term pressures on margins, but expects them to pick up thanks to better pricing.",369,-0.4488804340362549

To be sure, TCS also has a higher base, when compared to Infosys but its faster growth clip could bridge the valuation gap between the two companies.

“The valuation gap will get bridged because of the outperformance. The consensus among analysts is that Infosys will continue to grow faster than TCS in the near term,” an analyst tracking the companies said.

TCS is valued higher than Infosys, despite Infy delivering a superior growth rate. “TCS trades at 31 times one year forward PE–10 percent premium to Infosys despite having 3 percent lower earnings growth, ” analysts at Jefferies India said in a note.

PE is the price to earnings multiple. Whether Infosys can narrow this valuation gap depends on several factors, one of which will be its performance and outlook for FY23.

An industry source who did not want to be named said Infy's growth was thanks to the investments it made earlier sacrificing the margins. Since Salil Parekh took over as the CEO, the company has also made significant acquisitions and developed technical capabilities that pressured the margins.

Wipro, under CEO Thierry Delaporte, is also investing in digital capabilities that would help the firm grow faster. A case in point is the firm’s $1.45 billion acquisition of Capco. These would impact the margins and it is expected to be in the range of 17-19 percent.

On the other hand, TCS has been conservative when it comes to investing and continues to maintain the margin in the 24-26 percent range. In addition, the company has grown to a size where it is harder to be the fastest-growing.

But this is not to say that TCS has been performing subpar to its peers. With the scale almost twice of its peers, the IT performance has been at par with the competitors, analysts added.",409,0.5560135510232713

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCS

TCS reported a revenue of USD6.7b in 4QFY22, up 3.2%/2.6% QoQ in constant currency (CC)/USD terms, but slightly below our estimate of 3.1% QoQ growth. Revenue in 4QFY22 was driven by Retail and Manufacturing, while regional markets and others remained weak. EBIT margin was flat QoQ at 25% in 4QFY22 (in line). Given its record high employee headcount of 35k and continued sub-contracting pressure (+5% QoQ), we view the flat margin as a positive. Net profit rose 1.6% QoQ to INR99.3b (in line). TCS clocked record-high deal wins at USD11.3b (book-to-bill ratio at 1.7x), with two mega deals of ~USD1b each (with a tenor of seven-to-ten years). These strong deal wins suggest a robust revenue growth outlook for FY23. The management’s commentary on the demand environment continues to remain strong. It said it is in a better place v/s 4QFY21. With a record high employee addition, higher visibility on Cloud-led spending over the next two-to-three years, and strong demand, we are factoring in a revenue growth of 13.9% YoY in CC terms in FY23. While deal TCV in 9MFY22 was in a narrow range, a record TCV in 4Q should help ease concerns on smaller deals dominating flows in the sector. TCS has been able to tap into large transformational and platform-led opportunities, which should help position itself well in the context of its peer group in FY23. While the management indicated a muted margin over the next few quarters, it is seeing an uptick in pricing (including COLA adjustments in existing contracts), which should help profitability recover by 2HFY23. Moreover, TCS should start seeing some benefit in overall cost in FY23 from its fresher intake of 100k in FY22. We expect margin to continue to remain under pressure and below their long-term guided range of 26-28%.



Outlook

We have marginally (1%/2%) raised our FY23/FY24 EPS. We expect a 13.4%/ 16.5% USD revenue/INR EPS CAGR over FY22-24. Our TP of INR4,240/share, implies 30x FY24E EPS, with a 15% upside potential. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock.

With over 95 percent of the TCS employees continuing to work from home, the company now plans to get the top 50,000 senior employees to the office three times a week starting April, and gradually increase the number of people returning to the office, said Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO & MD.

By the middle of FY23, the company will have 20 percent working from offices and 80 percent from home, he added.

The 25 x 25 x 25 model

In April 2020, TCS announced the 25 x 25 x 25 work-from-home (WFH) model, where only 25 percent of its associates will need to work out of facilities at any point in time by 2025. Also, the employees will not need to spend more than 25 percent of their time at work.

The company employs 592,195 people, with over a lakh added in FY22.

Return to office

Speaking to media persons announcing the fourth quarter and FY22 results, Gopinathan said, “We are quite confident about the 25 by 25 model that we laid out. But it has to be implemented in a structured way.”

He explained that currently the company is operating at almost a 95-5 (95 percent employees working from home versus 5 percent in offices) model and they need to get back to a more normal model of, 80-20.

To accomplish this, the company will start bringing in senior associates, the top 50,000 who will start coming to office starting three days a week, from this month. “Then we will be continuously increasing the coverage of associates who will start coming back. We will take it gradually. So that the system can adjust to that shift and get to a stable point,” he said.

“So sometime during the middle of the year, we should be somewhere in the well on the way to the 80-20,” he added.",321,0.9999990463256836

The company’s attrition increased to 17.4 percent in the quarter, from 8.6 percent in the beginning of the year and 11.9 percent in the December 2021 quarter.

Kotak Institutional Equities, in its note, said that the talent shortage is likely to continue even as the industry added record number of freshers. ""We expect attrition to start moderating and ease off by 2HFY23 given strong hiring plans of companies,"" the note added.

The company's total employee count stood at 592,195 at the end of the fiscal. However, the company is confident about addressing the supply side challenges given the fresher supply.

The IT major is eying a new milestone for the fourth quarter with revenue likely to cross Rs 50,000 crore for the first time and the profit may hit Rs 10,000 crore.

According to 28 analysts polled by Bloomberg, TCS is expected to post revenue of Rs 50,355 crore while net profit will be at Rs 10,055 crore. Analysts expect a broadly stable margin with attrition almost peaking out. Management commentary on the outlook on the growth environment would be a key thing to watch out for.

Analysts say TCS has rolled out a new organisational structure with an intention to scale business and drive sharper customer focus. Roles of top leadership could change. Assessment of impact on business, if any, will be an area of focus, they add.

Factors to watch

Revenue growth: TCS is expected to register a 3 percent sequential growth in constant currency with a negative cross-currency impact of 30 basis points. Analysts expect that the growth will be led by general strength in discretionary spending and digital transformation programmes. The company faces a modest headwind from the anniversary of a couple of European deals.

EBIT Margins: Analysts forecast that EBIT margin is likely to come under pressure due to supply-side headwinds. According to analysts, TCS is likely to see a 20 bps quarter-on-quarter decline in EBIT margin to 24.8 percent due to continued rising employee costs amid high attrition.

""We believe margin headwinds such as higher hiring expenses to backfill rising attrition, increasing discretionary expenses, and higher-than normal visa expenses will be offset by operating efficiencies and improvement in pyramid balancing. We also believe TCS has strong supply-side capabilities among its peers. Net profit is expected to increase by 2.2% q-o-q"", Sharekhan said in a report.

Deal pipeline: Analysts expect the total contract value of deal wins to exceed $8 billion, a decline year on year but steady growth on a sequential basis. Investors will focus on commentary on annual contract value trends.

Investors focus: Analysts expect investors will focus on the demand outlook for FY23, the impact of high inflation and supply chain issues globally on tech spending, update on pricing given high inflation faced by clients, the presence of large and mega deals in the pipeline, supply-side issues, hiring trends, wage hikes and its impact on margins ahead, and implications of change in organiaational structure.

According to Kotak Institutional Equities, investors will focus on the outcome of the budgeting exercise and its implications for TCS, the impact of recent macroeconomic developments on budgets, reasons for relative underperformance in growth rates, reasons for lack of large deal momentum and the best way to read-through TCV signings, duration over which supply-side challenges will persist and measures to manage the same, levers to defend margins and timeframe when EBIT margins will hit 26-28 percent band, and durability of growth and magnitude of opportunity from the aggressive cloud shift by clients.",499,0.11475148797035217

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will kick off the result’s season for Nifty50 companies. Experts expect Q4FY22 to be another strong quarter for Indian IT players in terms of growth despite high base as Tier-II companies will likely outperform Tier-I companies yet again. Margins headwinds are expected to intensify with supply side pressures (retentions, promotions, ESOPs, etc) further accentuated by high inflation in the US and Europe leading to onsite salary pressures partly visible in the quarter ended March.

Growth is expected to be broad-based across verticals for the second largest Indian company in terms of market capitalisation. The firm continues to witness strong demand across technology segments aided by strong client requirements for cloud and digital transformation, data analytics, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IOT), 5G rollouts and cyber security.

Consolidated profit after tax for TCS may jump 8 percent on year to Rs 10,000 crore in the quarter ended March while consolidated revenues are expected to grow 15.5 percent on year to Rs 50,500 crore, said experts tracking the company.

The company had reported a profit of Rs 9,246 crore and revenue of Rs 43,705 crore in the corresponding period of previous financial year. Consolidated profit for the preceding quarter of the current financial year (October-December 2021) stood at Rs 9,769 crore on revenue of Rs 48,885 crore.

Expectations of the Street

Revenue growth

Kotak Institutional Equities pegs growth in dollar revenues at 11 percent on year to $6,649 million while constant currency revenues are expected to grow 12.9 percent on year and 2.4 percent on a sequential basis.

It expects the company to report revenues of Rs 50,067 crore for the quarter at an annualised growth rate of 14.6 percent and a sequential rate of 2.4 percent.

“Anniversary of a couple of European deals can create modest headwinds but overall growth will be led by general strength in discretionary spending and digital transformation programmes,” Kotak said.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services suggests: “TCS remains best positioned to benefit from long term structural tailwinds in tech services and should see a relative pickup in growth as the base effect and increased aggression aid it.”

It expects the company to report 12.3 percent growth on year in dollar revenues to $6,726 million while revenue in rupee terms is expected to grow 15.7 percent on year to Rs 50,600 crore, a sequential rate of 3.5 percent.

“Growth should continue to remain in a narrow band for TCS, despite strong demand momentum,” Motilal Oswal said.

Global brokerage firm Nomura estimates 11 percent on year growth in dollar revenues to $ 6,648 million while in constant currency terms revenue is expected to register sequential growth of 2.5 percent.

According to Nomura, rupee revenues are likely to increase by 14.1 percent on year to Rs 49,860 crore, an increase of 2 percent on quarter.

Experts expect deal wins in Q4FY22 to remain stable as compared to Q3FY22.

“We expect TCV (total contract value) of deal wins to exceed $8 billion, which is a decline on a year on year basis, but is steady growth on a sequential basis,” Kotak said.

Margins

Analysts expect the company to maintain stable margins on a sequential basis, while on an annualised basis margins are seen declining 180 basis points (bps).

“We forecast stable EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin-- headwind from backfilling of attrition will be offset by scale and efficiencies,” Kotak said.

Kotak expects EBIT margins for the quarter at 25 percent which is almost the same as the previous quarter. On a yearly basis, Kotak sees a decline of 183 bps from 26.8 percent margins reported in the same period of last year.

Nomura and Motilal Oswal concurred with Kotak and expect the company to report EBIT margins of 25 percent for the quarter.

Profitability

The profit after tax for the quarter is expected to grow between 7 and 9 percent on year.

Kotak sees profits rising 7 percent on year and 1.3 percent sequentially to Rs 9,893 crore.

Motilal Oswal expects profitability to increase 8.9 percent on year and cross the Rs 10,000 crore mark. Sequentially growth in profit is seen at 3.1 percent.

Key monitorables

Investors will be focusing on the impact of recent macro-economic developments on budgets/outlook; demand trends in key verticals like BFSI (banks, financial services and insurance), retail, manufacturing and communications; reasons for relative underperformance in growth rates and for lack of large deal momentum; duration over which supply side challenges will persist and measures to manage the same; levers to defend margins and timeframe when EBIT margins will recover to 26-28 percent band; pricing environment considering high inflation and tight labour markets; regional market outlook; and management commentary on any impact on tech spending from higher energy prices, inflation and potential economic slowdown.

The TCS stock ended flat at Rs 3,685.65 at the close on April 8 at the National Stock Exchange. The stock has gained 2.4 percent in the past one month and has generated returns of 11.1 percent during the past one year.

A TCS-led consortium has bagged a Rs 550 crore order from BSNL for deploying an indigenously-designed 4G network, an official source said on Friday. The TCS consortium will initially deploy 6,000 mobile towers for BSNL 4G services.

""The TCS-led consortium has been given an order worth Rs 550 crore to deploy 6,000 sites for 4G services,"" a senior BSNL official said. The deal was signed on Thursday, another source said.

An email query sent to TCS did not elicit any reply. Telecom Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had informed Parliament on Wednesday that indigenous 4G telecom network will soon be rolled out across India with the BSNL planning to install about 1.12 lakh towers throughout the country.

The minister had said that BSNL is in the process of ordering 6,000 towers immediately and then 6,000 more and finally 1 lakh to be installed all over the country for the 4G network. He said the development of 5G technology is going on in parallel and will be ready in a few months.",171,

Srinivasan Jayaraman recently left his job at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and had a week before joining his next organisation. Yearning to do something beyond learning new skills and spending more time with his family during this break, the Chennai-based software engineer decided to pick up a part-time job as a delivery agent at Zomato.

In just a few days, Jayaraman had a ringside view of the challenges faced by food delivery agents as they race against time to deliver food to customers within the stipulated time.

In a widely-shared LinkedIn post, he shared six key learnings as a Zomato delivery agent.

In a lot of cases, customers do not mention the correct location of delivery or update their phone numbers, Jayaraman said.

“Sometimes cannot locate a restaurant if we are new to the location. Even you can't find it easily when using Google Maps,” he pointed out.

Petrol & Diesel Rates Yesterday Petrol Rate in Mumbai Yesterday Current Petrol Price Per Litre ₹106 106 View more Diesel Rate in Mumbai Yesterday Current Petrol Price Per Litre ₹94 94 View more Show

Sometimes, the distance becomes a problem. He cited his own example of having to deliver food in a location 14 km away from the place where he had to pick up the food. It was his third order in three hours.

Unlike the pre-conceived notion that the so-called hotspot locations receive more orders, Jayaraman said he received fewer order from such areas, and that too, during peak hours.

He received just three orders in three hours.

Lastly, he said the shooting fuel price has been a huge issue. Tagging Zomato, he said, “Please help/support our warriors. I have seen some notifications where you are planning to help with a petrol price hike. Really appreciate that. Keep helping them.”

Last month, after Zomato founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal announced the online food delivery service provider’s plans to deliver food to customers in record 10 minutes, there was a huge backlash online, with many pointing out that waiting for 30 minutes for good food should not be a problem at all and that the express delivery service puts the safety of delivery agents.

Goyal came out with a detailed clarification the next day, stressing that safety of delivery agents will remain a priority even with the 10-minute delivery service.",419,-0.33665517965952557

When asked about the readiness of TCS to roll-out 5G network for telecom customers, Bhadada said, “TCS can stitch it today. TCS is doing it today. So it’s not about whether TCS is ready or not. TCS is ready. What we are working for in India is India-specific stack,” Bhadada said.

BSNL is working with TCS and C-DoT to roll-out an indigenously developed 5G-enabled 4G network.

The government expects the BSNL 4G network to be launched by August 15.

Bhadada said TCS is a system integrator and it builds networks of telecom operators based on their requirements.

The government is gearing up to hold 5G auctions before June so that 5G networks can also be launched by August 15.

“In my view 5G has at least 3 more years of cycle left before it starts, I mean India is in the very tail end of it. If you really look at it in the western markets everybody is in the middle of it. By 2023 or 2024 I feel all the 5G roll outs will be complete,” Bhadada said.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest IT solutions and services provider, has set an ambitious milestone to achieve $50 billion in revenues by 2030.

To achieve this, the company has embarked on a reorganisation, said MD and CEO Rajesh Gopinathan.

In an exclusive interview with Network18 earlier this week, Gopinathan had exuded confidence on the plan and said, “It is a logical evolution of where we are. Typically, we have been organised around three dimensions - geography, services and verticals. Now, we are trying to introduce a fourth dimension to our organisation.""

New structure

TCS is considering dividing its operational structure into four groups-- acquisition, relationship incubation, enterprise growth, and business transformation -- versus the existing three now.

The international brokerage firm, HSBC Global Research, terms TCS’s new organisational structure as futuristic.

The new operational structure is set to be based on client size broadly categorised into three cohorts: revenues less than $20 million, between $20 and $100 million and greater than $100 million.

“While ‘verticalisation’ within cohorts will remain (especially from large client cohorts and less so in less than $20 million cohort, company level vertical units and service lines (excluding cloud services) may be diluted,” said HSBC in its report.

Essentially, client requirements and delivery capabilities differ across the sizes of client relationship. Experts believe that by developing these cohorts TCS is looking to develop appropriate governance structures to improve client focus and offer customised solutions to better grow smaller clients and maintain larger client relationships.

Pros and cons of the new structure

“The new structure will help TCS provide targeted servicing across client size cohorts,"" said HSBC in its report. The less than $20 million client revenue cohort is branded as ‘relationship incubation’ which would develop solutions and delivery capabilities according to the client sizes.

The $100 million client cohort is branded as Business Transformation as large clients are spending more on transformation work with TCS.

Growth and transformation projects undertaken by customers would be key for the IT behemoth to achieve the $50 billion revenue target that they have set, said Gopinathan.

This will improve cross utilisation of resources across verticals within each cohort.

However, HSBC expressed concerns about the fungibility of resources across cohorts. “For instance, for a $20 million account to grow to $100 million, skills, resources and know-how may reside in the other cohort and may not be easily fungible,” the brokerage said.

Revenue contribution

It estimates that “mid-size clients ($20-100 million) – branded as ‘enterprise growth’ - and large clients ($100 million plus) - branded as ‘transformation opportunities’ - contribute to bulk of revenues for TCS, but then incremental growth for less than $20 million clients will be higher, due to the base effect and potentially lower wallet size for TCS in these accounts”.

The enterprise growth and transformation opportunities segment contributes 40 percent each to the company’s revenues while the balance 20 percent comes from relationship incubation.

Business scenario

The brokerage firm Edelweiss recently hosted the top management of TCS at the Edelweiss India e-Conference 2022 wherein the management asserted that increased outsourcing, cloud adoption and increased client spends towards digital transformation will be key growth drivers.

The company sees strong demand momentum as clients are spending more on IT to move to public cloud. “Newer technologies necessitate the use of cloud; upon migration, many opportunities with innovative capabilities arise to drive customer experience, products and services due to operational resilience and hyperscalers’ stack,” the report from Edelweiss said.

The company has the lowest attrition rate across the industry and the management believes attrition has been flattening out, which might result in easing supply side challenges.

Investment case

The company sees significant progress has been made on workload moving to cloud even though only 35-40 percent has been moved till now. In its core segments like BFSI the shift has been only 10–15 percent which implies that the company still has a big runway.

“TCS is positioned to benefit from this tech shift as many customers are embarking on multi-year, enterprise-wide transformation journeys,” added Edelweiss in its report.

Edelweiss believes that demand remains robust as growth indicators continue to be strong, including deal-wins, client additions and hiring trends. “The stock is trading at 29.1x FY23E EPS and we maintain ‘BUY’ with a target price of Rs 5,000 (40x Q1FY24E EPS)”.

HSBC, on the other hand, believes that TCS remains a leader in terms of both size and market positioning in emerging technologies. “However, considering what we view as low further upside potential on revenues and valuations, we prefer to remain on the sidelines,” it said.

HSBC values TCS at a target PE multiple of 35x FY22E, driven by the improved outlook for growth over the next 3-4 years. “The target valuation is a 50 percent premium to the past five-year average, and a 45 percent premium to the market, owing to strong operating metrics and better revenue growth visibility,” the report from HSBC said. It has maintained its target price of Rs 4,250 for the stock.

The brokerages believe that the company faces potential downside risks from double-dip recession in the US, and a prolonged slowdown in Europe; sharp cross-currency movements and appreciation in the rupee against dollar, euro, British pound sterling and pricing pressure.

Potential upsides include stronger-than-expected pick-up in the BFSI and retail segments, aggressive large deal conversion and depreciation of rupee.

""It is a logical evolution of where we are. Typically, we have been organised around three dimensions - geography, services and verticals. Now, we are trying to introduce a fourth dimension to our organisation,"" the TCS MD & CEO told CNBC-TV18.

""How do we achieve this kind of a change? What does it take to get us there? We need these engines of growth - cost and optimization and growth and transformation,"" Gopinathan said about the transformation taking place in TCS.

Growth and transformation projects undertaken by its customers would be the key for the IT behemoth to achieve the $50 billion revenue target that they have set, says the TCS MD & CEO.

Saying that earlier organisational structure was around geography, verticals and services, Rajesh Gopinathan asserted the company needed to have the right structure to participate in growth opportunities.

Explaining further on the new structural growth that the company was attempting, he added, ""It will be a more balanced portfolio when we achieve the $50 billion revenue target.""

""When we achieve $50 billion, TCS will be a lot more balanced on the business and technology front, around growth and transformation vs cost and optimization,"" Rajesh Gopinathan said.

Gopinathan claimed the focus of TCS had always been on growing customer franchises and that the new structure would help in the logical progression of a customer's journey.

On the target to achieve this kind of change, he said, they are introducing this new growth engine as they aim to realise the logical progression of the company's relationship with its customers.

When asked about the aim of the restructural plan, Rajesh Gopinathan explained, ""Again with our focus on the customer. The nature of customer relationships is very different if different scenarios are taken into consideration. More importantly, when we look at a customer's lifetime relationship with us, there is a journey that the customer goes through. Initial projects have to be developed in time to develop trust and relationships.""

""The comfort results in a greater expanded relationship. Then the customer looks for the strategic value that they look for in us. This new dimension we are introducing will realise this logical progression of relationship with our customers. We want to see that the customer's journey with us should be as seamless and possible,"" he added.

Beginning in April, TCS will divide its entire business into four groups: acquisition, relationship incubation, enterprise growth, and business transformation, presenting an industry-first model that moves away from the ""traditional three-dimensional (framework) of geography, vertical, or services,"" according to the ET sources, while putting a focus on clients, their changing digital needs, and faster delivery times.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

""The operating model will be aligned to the customer journey at every step, leaders who have been groomed ( for this model) will lead these new groups,” the publication reported.

According to the report, the leaders of all four groups will report directly to CEO Rajesh Gopinathan who is leading the transformation.

The report added a TCS spokesman, when asked about the restructural plan, refused to offer comment on the company's ""internal business plan or strategies"".

As interest in metaverse grows, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is investing in the space with the firm having put out deal proposals for customers that are currently small in size but expected to go up over the next five years, said the president and head of business and technology services.

In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Krishnan Ramanujam said, “We are quite excited about it and we are making significant investments in metaverse along those lines. But the deal pipeline in terms of value will be very small.”

This comes in the wake of buzz around metaverse, a 3D virtual world which people can traverse in their digital avatars, especially since the US tech major Facebook rebranded itself into Meta, to reflect its shift in focus. Silicon Valley companies such as Microsoft and even banks are going big on metaverse. For instance, global investment bank JP Morgan Chase opened its metaverse lounge Decentreland recently. In a report, it said the market opportunity is expected to be $1 trillion.

For IT companies, the metaverse offers a significant opportunity, thanks in large part to the pandemic that accelerated cloud adoption. Top IT companies, including TCS, are investing in this opportunity.

Speaking to Moneycontrol about the opportunities, Ramanujam said that the metaverse is one of the possibilities that is coming from the foundation of the cloud, which accelerated in the pandemic. The metaverse is expected to see faster uptake as companies adopt it for various use cases, he added.

“When the initial adoption starts, there will be an inflection point where the adoption will explode just as COVID-19 proved to be one for global adoption. Hopefully, it will be not a bad thing like the pandemic (for the metaverse),” he explained.

Given the potential metaverse has, Ramanujam said TCS is already has significant investments in it.

Metaverse use cases

The most popular use case for metaverse is shopping experience. “Online shopping and associated experiences are the most basic very preliminary proofs of concept and are very popular,” Ramanujam said.

Workplace experience is another area where companies are seeing traction. TCS has already made proof of concept for employee on-boarding and customer experience, where the company has done a small pilot and the project is in production.

“You can familiarise employees with everything in your office if someone is joining TCS office, giving virtual reality experience like the layout of the office and canteen. So employee onboarding is a very popular use case. Like that, there are a few more, but I would say those are still fairly very preliminary,” he added.",437,0.5681831359863281

Terming Metaverse as an ""exciting phenomenon"" that has ""several use cases"" for the various companies and industries beyond its initial enthusiasm, Krishnan Ramanujan, NASSCOM President & Head of Business & Tech Services at Indian IT outsourcing behemoth TCS noted that metaverse proffered a ""significant space of opportunities for Indian companies.""

Observing the expanse of possibilities, Ramanujan said that the ""Easiest opportunities would surely be in terms of employee onboarding and experience-related things. There are a lot of training, education, skill development related use cases. Beyond that, there are many opportunities that are currently in the ideation stage"".

""As time progresses and the metaverse technology matures, it will be able to respond more effectively in terms of speed latency and so on. The reason for all this excitement around the metaverse is because of the opportunities and the prospects that it could throw up for solving problems in many industries, which might be difficult to solve today, or creating revenue opportunities in the future that are inconceivable by the consumers at present"", he continued.

Citing its utility and potential in the entertainment industry, Ramanujan said that ""a lot of studios could look towards creating content, especially for the metaverse"".

Another example where he felt that the metaverse could really step in with great effectiveness was that of uplifting the online retail shopping experience for customers.

Ramanujan explained the same by saying that many companies have proofs of concept that detail an inside, in-depth, experiential, immersive, and almost as close to real an encounter for the consumer when it comes to physical stores. But many times, that is impossible, given that there is a paucity on the number of people available to execute that vision.

""Without the need of human skill or intervention, metaverse can throw up mind-boggling opportunities in terms of transactions, educating consumers by giving them various offers and advice, and so on. This is one metaverse-related solution that sounds not so possible today"", he added.

Mentioning that metaverse could become a force to reckon with in the next three-five years, Ramanujan said that the change is imminent sooner than anticipated.

""Even just a year prior to the pandemic, there were all kinds of issues associated with Cloud. While everybody clearly said that's a great transformation enabler, there were simultaneous worries about security, data confidentiality, and sovereignty. But come pandemic, like magic, all those concerns flew away. And that became the biggest trigger for how the cloud became such a huge transformation enabler. Perhaps, hopefully, not a bad thing like the pandemic but maybe there'll be a good trigger to push for the adoption of metaverse as well"", said the TCS executive.

However, Ramanujan exercised caution in terms of revenue generation from this space in the times to come, noting that not a very big chunk of the estimated $350 billion, a potential figure the Indian tech industry can achieve by 2026, per NASSCOM, would stem from metaverse-related activities.",503,0.2929079631964366

Global investors focusing on environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of companies, even attaching a premium to it, will make it increasingly important for the group to expedite its plans as it needs access to global funds across businesses to reduce debt and finance growth.

Closer home, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has committed to a five-point climate action plan, the so-called “Panchamrit”, at the core of which is the ambition to be a net zero emissions country by 2070. Tata Sons, which is already working towards sustainability and clean energy, will have to work more aggressively to align itself to the plan.

For a group that traditionally used conventional energy to fuel its energy-guzzling businesses, Tata Sons has a stated sustainability policy that looks at creating long-term stakeholder value by integrating economic, environmental and social considerations for all Tata companies. The group set up the Tata Sustainability Group in 2014 which partners with all the Tata companies to embed sustainability in their business strategies. Group executives said that Chandrasekaran is likely to use this platform to push the group to improve its ESG ratings.

Experts tracking the group believe it will work on a two-pronged strategy—focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy while generating and sourcing electricity, and reduction of carbon emissions across businesses.

New Energy

Before 2022 began, Chandrasekaran addressed Tata Sons employees in a letter that was seen to be setting the tone for the group’s road ahead. He said in the letter to colleagues that new energy will be a key premise for the group. “Our strategy, looking ahead, has four themes: digital, new energy, supply chain resilience, and health. Our companies are already adapting to these changes, and we are witnessing a stronger performance,” he said in the letter.

In line with this strategy, the group’s power utility, Tata Power Company, is focusing on its green energy arm Tata Power Renewables to grow it fivefold in five years across businesses. It aims to scale up capacity to 15 GW by 2025 from about 3 GW now. Tata Power has a strategic goal of phasing out its coal-based power and scale up clean energy that makes up around 30 percent of total generation now to 80 percent by 2030. The group is keen to unlock value in the renewable business.

In an interview to Moneycontrol last month, Tata Power Renewables president Ashish Khanna said, “We have not changed a lot of portfolios; we have just been going on with aggressive growth in the segment we were serving in the past.”

The company’s push on renewables is in line with India’s ambitious target to have half of its energy mix from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. At COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow, Modi increased the target India has set for renewable energy capacity to 500 GW; it is around 150 GW now.

The new “aggression” in energy transition is apparent and will be a continued theme in Chandrasekaran’s second term at the helm, as the next five years would be crucial to achieve these milestones.

With a focus on sustainable and clean energy development, Tata Power is also steering the transformation as an integrated solutions provider by looking at new business growth in distributed generation through rooftop solar and micro grids, storage solutions, electric vehicles charging infrastructure and home automation, among other initiatives.

Group companies like Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) have also taken steps to source more energy from cleaner sources. Tata Motors is a signatory to the RE100 initiative of The Climate Group, under which it has committed to using 100 percent renewable energy by 2030.

Chasing ESG Goals

In early 2021, Tata Sons had reportedly sent a directive to the top management of all group companies to work on a priority basis towards formulating a framework that would help each one of them to meet ESG norms. While parts of this plan are already evident, Chandrasekaran is likely to consolidate a plan for the entire group, sources within the group have indicated.

India’s aim to be at net zero emission by 2070 means that the share of electric cars and the contribution of biofuels for heavier vehicles will have to increase to 84 percent, and industries will have to transition to cleaner biofuels or hydrogen. While the group’s new pilots and businesses, from 5G to TataNeu and Tata Electronics, are being built around the ESG theme, existing businesses are moving swiftly to adapt it.

TCS has plans to be a net zero emission company by 2030 and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70 percent till 2025. As a global technology giant, this will be important for the company as not just investors but even customers are closely watching its performance on these parameters.

Tata Steel is working towards making the production process more sustainable, and making CO2-neutral steel with hydrogen.

Tata Chemicals has committed to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to reduce CO2 emissions. The company is building its first industrial-scale carbon capture unit in the UK.

Tata Sons’ Sustainability Working Council said in a meeting in December after the COP26 meeting that India’s projected carbon emissions by 2030 will be 4.48 billion tonnes, almost double its present emissions. This would mean a 22 percent reduction in carbon emissions from the business-as-usual scenario will be required if the country wants to achieve its goal of cutting projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes.

Chandrasekaran has led the group from the pledge to plan stages for these milestones. Now he faces the task of executing these plans.",978,0.880036065975825

Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy welcomed Tata Sons’ move to extend Chairman N Chandrasekaran's tenure for five more years, stating that his tenure at TCS and Tata Sons has been very lustrous.

""Chandrasekaran is a highly respected and successful corporate leader in India. His tenure at both TCS and Tata Sons has been very lustrous. I am very happy that his tenure has been extended by another five years. He richly deserves it. My best wishes to him and Tata Sons,"" Murthy, one of the doyens of corporate India, told Moneycontrol in an email response.

His comments came after the board of Tata Sons on February 11 decided to extend the tenure of Chandrasekaran for a period of five years.

""Mr. Ratan. N. Tata who was a special invitee to this meeting expressed his satisfaction with the progress and performance of the Tata Group under the leadership of Mr. N Chandrasekaran. He recommended his term be renewed for a further five-year period. The Board members commended the performance of the Executive Chairman and unanimously approved the reappointment of Mr. N Chandrasekaran as the Executive Chairman for the next five years,"" the company said in an official statement.

Chandrasekaran’s present term as the chairman was scheduled to come to end this month.

“It has been a privilege to lead the Tata Group for the last five years and I am delighted at the opportunity to lead the Tata Group for another five years, in its next phase,” Chandrasekaran said.

Murthy and Chandrasekaran are known to have close ties and deep respect for each other, even as they competed in the software services industry. Four years ago, Murthy and Chandrasekaran took stage together to speak to students of NIT Trichy at their convocation. N Chandra is an alumnus of the institute, where he did his Masters in computer applications. They both stressed the importance of value systems during their address.",333,0.9999959468841553

The market capitalisation of Tata Group companies has nearly tripled during the first tenure of N Chandrasekaran as the Chairman of Tata Sons.

The Group on February 11 extended the term of Chandrasekaran as the Chairman of the multi-billion dollar conglomerate five years after he was first appointed.

The total market capitalisation of the listed entities of the group has risen by 183 percent in the five-year period starting February 2017 to Rs 23.8 lakh crore, making it the highest valued Indian conglomerate, data from AceEquity showed. In the same period, the Nifty 50 index has risen 97 percent.

In the five-year period prior to Chandrasekaran's appointment, the market capitalisation of listed Tata Group companies had risen 100 percent to nearly Rs 8 lakh crore.

The biggest gainers in terms of market capitalisation during the five-year period were Tata Teleservices, Tata Elxsi, Tata Consumer Products, Titan Company, Tata Steel, and Tata Consultancy Services.

Tata Elxsi’s market capitalisation surged 976 percent in the five-year period to Rs 47,352 crore. TCS, which accounts for 58 percent of the Group’s market value, saw its market capitalisation rise by 200 percent in the same period to Rs 13.95 lakh crore.

Much of the upswing in the fortune of the Group can be traced back to the ongoing bull market in the Indian equity market since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Further, the rise in global commodity markets since the beginning of the pandemic owing to a supply crunch and depleting inventories has brought investors back to many of the 'old economy' stocks that are part of the Group, analysts said.

Tata Steel, for example, has seen its market capitalisation swell by 286 percent to Rs 1.52 lakh crore under Chandrasekaran’s tenure with the majority of those gains coming during the pandemic period as the company benefitted from a rise in global steel prices.

Among the disappointment of Chandrasekaran's tenure has been the performance of Tata Motors. Shares of Tata Motors have risen merely 20 percent in his first term as chairman reflecting the ongoing concerns over the company’s subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover. That said, Tata Motors' stock has risen substantially in the past 18 months after the company announced plans to go net debt-free in the coming years.

Only two stocks gave negative returns in Chandrasekaran’s reign, these were the differentiated voting rights of Tata Motors which fell 20 percent, and TRF, which fell 36 percent.",413,0.3632294876234872

Towards the end, however, the focus had shifted to global cues that brought in some kind of profit-booking.

Experts feel the ongoing momentum, if it sustains and global cues support, can take the Nifty50 towards the 18,000 mark, with crucial support around the 17,240 levels.

The Nifty50 rose 2.4 percent to close at 17,516.30, backed by across-the-board buying. The broader markets also participated in the run with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices climbing nearly 2 percent each.

""We did not get carried away by this small profit-booking (seen in the last two days of last week), rather it is likely to provide an excellent trading opportunity for traders who missed the move due to a sharp recovery. This view remains valid as long as we hold sacrosanct support of 17,240 on a closing basis,"" says Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One.

On the higher side, he feels 17,700 – 17,800 are the immediate levels to watch out for. ""If global markets support, we may see the Nifty surpassing these hurdles to move towards the 18,000 mark.""

The only disappointing factor last week was the underperformance of individual stocks. Generally, in a quiet market, individual themes continue to shine; but it was clearly missing in the latter half of last week, says Chavan who hopes this picture changes and traders would find ample of opportunities to trade in the broader market.

Here are top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on the February 4 closing prices:

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Hindustan Copper: Buy | LTP: Rs 137.70 | Stop-Loss: Rs 129.50 | Target: Rs 152 | Return: 10.4 percent

The Dollar Index (DXY) has seen a sharp reversal in this week and is implying a short-term bearish trend. The metals space has a negative correction with the dollar index and a negative trend in the DXY should support the metal stocks.

Hindustan Copper has recently seen a long consolidation around its 200-day EMA (exponential moving average) and now the stock has witnessed a buying interest. This can be seen by the rising volumes in the counter along with the rising stock prices and the prices have even given a breakout from its consolidation phase.

The RSI (relative strength index) oscillator indicates a positive momentum and hence we expect the stock to continue its up move in the short term.

Traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy in the range of Rs 137-134 for potential targets of Rs 146 and Rs 152. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 129.50 on long positions.

VRL Logistics: Buy | LTP: Rs 530.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 490 | Target: Rs 572 | Return: 7.9 percent

The stock has been forming a 'Higher Top Higher Bottom' structure on the weekly charts and is thus in an uptrend. In the last couple of months, the stock went through a time-wise correction and prices have given a breakout from this consolidation this week.

In the last three sessions, the stock price up move was supported by good volumes which indicate that the stock has resumed its broader uptrend. The breakout zone of Rs 510-505 should now become a support on any declines and hence, short-term traders can adopt a buy-on-dip strategy in the stock.

Thus, traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy in the range of Rs 520-515 for potential targets of Rs 550 and Rs 572 in next 3-4 weeks. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 490 on long positions.

IndusInd Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 956.05 | Stop-Loss: Rs 920 | Target: Rs 1,016 | Return: 6.3 percent

The banking space has witnessed a decent outperformance in last one month. Stocks within this sector are witnessing good buying interest. IndusInd Bank has underperformed its peers in terms of stock price performance recently, but we witnessed decent buying interest in the stock this week and the stock has given a breakout above its resistance.

The daily price chart resembles a 'Cup and Handle' pattern and a breakout with good volumes indicates probability of an up move in the stock in the near term.

Thus, traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy in the range of Rs 955-950 for a potential target of Rs 1,016 in next 3-4 weeks. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 920 on long positions.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

TCS: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,814.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,700 | Target: Rs 3,900-4,000 | Return: 5 percent

The stock is in pullback mode after hitting a low of Rs 3,625. It was at Rs 4,040 when the company announced buy-back of shares and from there the stock fell to Rs 3,625.

The stock is in the middle of a downtrend. In the pullback mode, the stock may repeat the target of Rs 3,900-4,000. Buy half at current levels that are close to Rs 3,800 and the rest buy more downside at Rs 3,750. Place stop-loss at Rs 3,700.

LIC Housing Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 394.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 370 | Target: Rs 450-460 | Return: 16.5 percent

The stock has made a strong price break out after forming a falling wedge consolidation, which is positive for it. The break out is decisive and depending on the formation, it could extend to Rs 450-460 in the next few weeks.

The strategy should be to buy partly at current levels and on the downside at Rs 385 levels. Protect the trading long position with the final stop-loss at Rs 370.

Sumitomo Chemical: Buy | LTP: Rs 418.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 380 | Target: Rs 440-460 | Return: 10 percent

The stock was consolidating below the Rs 400 level for quite a period, however, after the strong quarterly numbers, the stock has managed to cross it with a gap and decisive volume.

Technically, it should surpass the previous high, which is at Rs 460, in the medium term. However, our strategy should be to buy some at the current levels and balance on the dips with the final stop-loss at Rs 380.

Expert: Vinay Rajani, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities

DCM Shriram: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,191.70 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,140 | Target: Rs 1,380 | Return: 15.8 percent

The stock has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on daily charts. It is placed above all important moving averages, which indicates bullish trend on all time frames. The stock has broken out from downward sloping trend line, adjoining the previous swing highs on daily chart.

The stock price has broken out from bullish 'flag' pattern on the daily charts. Price breakout was accompanied with rising volumes. Indicators and oscillators are showing strength in the current uptrend. Sugar sector has been outperforming for last couple of months

VRL Logistics: Buy | LTP: Rs 530.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 500 | Target: Rs 595 | Return: 12 percent

The stock has broken out from the consolidation, which held for previous 14 weeks. The recent breakout can be considered as a horizontal channel breakout on the weekly charts.

Price breakout is accompanied with jump in volumes. Indicators and oscillators have turned bullish on daily and weekly charts. Stock price has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily charts.

Suven Pharmaceuticals: Buy | LTP: Rs 558.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 525 | Target: Rs 630 | Return: 13 percent

The stock price has broken out from bullish 'flag' pattern on the daily chart. It has also surpassed the crucial resistance derived from downward sloping trend line on the daily charts.

The price breakout is accompanied with a rise in volumes. Indicators and Oscillators have turned bullish on the daily and weekly charts. The stock is trading above its 20, 50, 100 and 200 days EMA (exponential moving average). Primary trend of the stock has been bullish with higher tops and higher bottoms.

Expert: Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One

Cholamandalam Investment and Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 675.70 | Stop-Loss: Rs 640 | Target: Rs 732 | Return: 8.3 percent

This stock has seen a significant up move in the last week and was among the outperformers from the financial space. The stock has seen a decisive volume-based breakout in the previous trading session and is firmly poised to enter the unchartered terrain.

Recent consolidation followed by a breakout in the price action increases the possibility of unfolding the next leg of the rally. We recommend buying this stock for a trading target of Rs 732. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 640.

Biocon: Buy | LTP: Rs 391.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 376.80 | Target: Rs 418 | Return: 6.7 percent

During the entire calendar year 2021, this stock did not well and has underperformed its most of the peer counters by a fair margin. Now the way prices are behaving around its sacrosanct supports, it's an indication of change of tide on short to medium term charts.

With last week's rally, we can see a breakout happening from a 'triangle' pattern which has strengthened its weekly time frame. In addition, the volumes are supportive along with the positive placement of key moving averages. Hence, traders can look to buy for a near term target of Rs 418. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 376.80.

India’s largest IT firm Tata Consultancy Services on Thursday said it will expand operations in New Jersey by hiring about 1,000 additional employees by 2023 to meet the growing needs of customers to digitally transform their businesses.

To support a pipeline of local IT talent for the state, TCS will also grow the reach of its STEM and computer science education programmes in New Jersey by 25 per cent, expanding teacher training and student programmes, the company said in a statement.

The term STEM refers to science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

""TCS to expand STEM education programs in New Jersey and add 1,000 new employees by 2023,” the company statement said.

TCS’ Edison Business Center, one of 30 company facilities in the US, serves more than 100 customers in New Jersey.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has become the second most valuable brand in the IT services sector globally, while Infosys and four other Indian tech majors have firmly established their position among the top 25 IT services brands tally, according to Brand Finance. Following TCS and Infosys (third spot), there are four more Indian brands now firmly established among the global elite – Wipro (7th), HCL (8th), Tech Mahindra (15th) and LTI (22nd), as per the Brand Finance IT Services 25 2022 report.

All six Indian brands feature among the top 10 fastest-growing IT Services brands over the course of 2020-2022, the brand valuation firm added. Accenture retained the title of world's most valuable and strongest IT services brand, boasting record brand value of $36.2 billion, as per the report.

Indian IT services brands made a leap with average growth from 2020 to 2022 at 51 per cent, compared to a seven per cent drop for brands from the US. A global turn to remote working for professional services and an accelerated digitalisation trend across the global economy have facilitated expansion of IT services hubs within India.

With strong IT services brands and a large population of people with digital skills, India will continue to play a major role in developing infrastructure for artificial intelligence, data analytics and Internet of Things (IoT), it added. The report said as IBM has gone down to fourth rank, TCS has risen up to second spot in ranking, following 12 per cent growth year-on-year and 24 per cent since 2020, to a brand value of $16.8 billion.

TCS – in a regulatory filing said – this growth is attributed to the company's investments in its brand and its employees, customer equity and strong financial performance. Strong revenue growth in 2021, saw TCS cross an important milestone, hitting $25 billion in revenue for the first time, with an industry-leading operating profit margin of over 25 per cent.

""TCS continues to rise up the IT services rankings to become the second most valuable brand in the sector for the first time. ""This great achievement is the result of strong financial growth, strong and continued investments in a new global brand positioning last year… I also see TCS' focused commitment to serving the needs of its employees, customers, and communities, which always in the long run drives brand performance,"" David Haigh, CEO and Chairman of Brand Finance, said.

TCS CMO Rajashree R said the ranking is a landmark milestone for the company and a validation of its increased market relevance and focus on innovation and transformation of clients, their customers, and the larger community. ""With our differentiated 'customer focused' strategy, superior execution, investments in building newer capabilities and sustained focus on research and innovation over the last decade, we are indeed well positioned to capitalise on the multi-year technology transformation opportunities that lie ahead,"" Rajashree added.

Infosys, at the third spot, emerged as the fastest-growing IT services brand globally following 52 per cent brand value growth since last year and 80 per cent since 2020 to USD 12.8 billion. Over the past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the change is even more impressive with the brand recording an 80 per cent gain, the report said.

Strong business results can be attributed to the brand's ability to credibly adapt its offering to fast-evolving needs of today's economy as well as to its continued investment into innovative solutions that help clients securely accelerate their journey to the cloud, the report noted. Infosys has also continued to build brand recognition globally by nurturing sports collaborations with ATP, Roland Garros, and the Australian Open, while also forging new ones with Madison Square Garden and media-heavyweights The Economist, Financial Times, Bloomberg, it added.

While digital transformation accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, Wipro's performance demonstrated strong revenues and growth in brand value, the report said, adding that the Bengaluru-based conglomerate has a brand value of $6.3 billion with an increase of 48 per cent since the previous year. HCL – which has signed 58 projects across various sectors, including telecommunications, life sciences, manufacturing and technology – saw 10 per cent growth in brand value over the past year to $6.1 billion. The brand announced that its revenue grew by 2.4 per cent y-o-y to a total of $10.2 billion, the report stated.

Tech Mahindra had a brand value growth of 45 per cent over the last two years to $3 billion. The growth is a result of focussed brand building efforts, the report said, adding that it was also the only Indian organisation to receive the Terra Carta Seal by the Prince of Wales for its commitment to creating a sustainable future. ""By implementing projects that lay equal emphasis on people, planet, and profits, the organisation has been recognised for its social impact. Additionally, the business focus on digitalisation, cloud transformation, telecommunications, and other key digital requirements has consistently strengthened Tech Mahindra's brand positioning,"" it said.",841,0.999992468140342

Two of the top three most valuable IT services brands across the globe are Indian. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys have beaten IBM to take the number two and three spots, respectively, in the annual report by Brand Finance, the world’s leading brand valuation firm.

Accenture has retained the title of the world’s most valuable and strongest IT services brand for the fourth consecutive year.

In addition to measuring overall brand value, Brand Finance also evaluates the relative strength of brands, based on factors such as marketing investment, customer familiarity, staff satisfaction, and corporate reputation. Alongside revenue forecasts, brand strength is a crucial driver of brand value.

In the Brand Finance Global 500 2022 report, Infosys has been recognized as the fastest-growing IT services brand in the world and among the Top 25 fastest-growing brands across sectors globally.

Year-on-year brand value grew by 52% to $12.8 billion, with Infosys rising 56 places in the Brand Finance Global 500 2022 ranking.

The company said in a statement that growth in brand value and strength is ""the outcome of the company’s concerted efforts to build a deeply client-relevant brand that also serves as a trusted engine of change.""

Putting it in a pandemic context, David Haigh, chairman and CEO, Brand Finance, said, ""While the COVID-19 pandemic spurred the necessity of a digital transition across the globe, Infosys stepped up to the challenge, resulting in its monumental 80% leap in brand value over the course of the past two years.""

The company has continued to invest and nurture market-relevant brands to help clients accelerate their digital transformation journeys. It's also focussed on nurturing a well-differentiated employer brand marked ""with significant learning opportunities, growth trajectories and purposeful career paths for employees.""

Those of us who have caught a bit of tennis recently would have spotted Infosys court-side. The company continues its partnerships with the ATP, Roland Garros and the Australian Open. It has made strategic investments in several digital and brand partnerships. This includes Infosys’ Signature Marketing Partnership with the Madison Square Garden – also making Infosys the Official Digital Innovation Partner of key MSG properties including the New York Knicks, New York Rangers and the Madison Square Garden Arena.

While Infosys took a monumental leap forward, TCS took yet another steady step closer to the very top as it ranked as the second most valuable IT brand in the world.

This latest feather in TCS's cap comes a day after the Government of India announced N Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons, as a Padma Bhushan awardee.

Chandrasekaran also ranks as the top CEO in India and stands at 25th position globally in the Brand Finance Brand Guardianship Index 2022 of world’s top 250 CEOs.

Chandrasekaran is a TCS lifer. He began his career in 1987 at the IT major and went on to become its CEO from 2009 until 2016 when he was appointed as the Chairman of Tata Sons.

The latest Brand Finance report finds that TCS’s brand value has increased by $1.844 billion which is a 12.5% increase in comparison to last year. Its brand value in 2022 stands at $16.8 billion.

The Tata Group company initiated a brand refresh in 2021 and launched a new brand statement ‘Building on Belief' as it repositioned TCS from a B2B to a ""B2B2C"" player.

TCS is also one of the most recognized Indian brands globally in large part owing to its sponsorships and partnerships in sports like running and more recently racing, including The New York City Marathon, London Marathon and Toronto Marathon and the Jaguar TCS racing team.

In the Global 500

Looking at particular sub-regions within Asia-Pacific, Tata Group is the most valuable brand in South Asia and India’s only entry in the top 100, with a brand value of US$23.9 billion, following a 12% increase from the previous year.

The report states that the performance of Tata Group exceeded expectations in 2021, thanks to a number of new acquisitions and partnerships and as key group companies – from Tata Consultancy Services to Tata Steel – witnessed major growth. The market capitalisation of Tata Group’s 20 listed subsidiaries has exceeded that of 70 listed central public sector undertakings (CPSUs) in India.

Tata Consultancy Services promoters – Tata Sons and Tata Investment Corporation Ltd (TICL) – intend to participate in the IT services major’s Rs 18,000 crore buyback offer by tendering shares worth about Rs 12,993.2 crore.

On Wednesday, the TCS board approved an up to Rs 18,000 crore buyback offer entailing 4 crore shares at Rs 4,500 apiece.

According to a postal ballot notice by the company, Tata Sons and TICL intend to participate in the buyback offer.

Tata Sons, which holds about 266.91 crore shares, intends to tender 2.88 crore shares, while TICL (which holds 10,23,685 shares) intends to tender 11,055 shares, it added.

At Rs 4,500 apiece, the two entities stand to rake in about Rs 12,993.2 crore. TCS is seeking shareholder approval by way of special resolution for buyback of equity shares of the company.

The remote e-voting period will commence from January 14, 2022 and end on February 12, 2022. The results of the postal ballot will be announced on February 15, 2022, it added.

The previous buyback of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), worth about Rs 16,000 crore, had opened on December 18, 2020, and closed on January 1, 2021, in which group holding firm Tata Sons had tendered shares worth Rs 9,997.5 crore.

Over 5.33 crore equity shares were bought at that time (offer price was Rs 3,000 apiece) and out of the total, Tata Sons’ 3,33,25,118 shares were accepted under the buyback offer.

In 2018, India’s largest IT services firm repurchased shares worth up to Rs 16,000 crore at Rs 2,100 apiece. A similar exercise was conducted in 2017 as well.

As per the postal ballot detailed in Thursday’s stock exchange filing, promoter companies held 72.19 per cent stake in TCS as on January 12, 2022.

It added that the offer price of Rs 4,500 per share represents a premium of 18.21 per cent and 18.19 per cent over the closing price of the equity share on BSE and NSE, respectively, as on January 6, 2022.

The postal ballot said the current buyback is “in line with the company’s shareholder-friendly capital allocation practices of returning excess cash to shareholders, thereby increasing shareholder value in the longer term, and improving the “Return on Equity”.

The buyback, subject to the regulatory consents and approvals, if any, is proposed to be completed within 12 months from the date of passing of the special resolution by the shareholders.",411,0.9999969005584717

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCS

TCS reported 3QFY22 revenue of USD6.52b, up 4.0% QoQ in constant currency (CC) – above our estimate of 3.2% QoQ growth. 3Q topline was driven by Communication, Technology and Regional markets, while Manufacturing and Retail verticals dragged down growth. EBIT margin contracted 60bp QoQ to 25.0%, 100bp lower than our estimate of 26.0%, as TCS augmented its employee intake (all-time high at 28k), along with a spike in sub-contracting cost. Net profit stood at INR97.7b, up 1.5% QoQ, which was below our estimate due to the miss on operating margin. TCS’s 3Q deal wins remained stable at USD7.6b, with no mega deal (similar to 2Q). We view the stability in deal wins in the absence of mega deals as positive. This also implies a higher annual contract value (ACV) that should support near-term growth. We are encouraged by the company’s robust topline growth in a seasonally weaker quarter. We expect this performance to alleviate the concerns on its growth potential and the likely drag from growing share of smaller deals in the market. Management commentary on demand environment continues to remain strong, with a high visibility on Cloud-led spending over the next 2-3 years. We are factoring in FY23E revenue growth of 15% YoY in CC.

Outlook

We maintain our positive stance on TCS, given its strong growth outlook. Our TP of INR4,250 implies 30x FY24E EPS, with a 10% upside potential. Maintain BUY.

Despite the seasonally weak December quarter, the three large IT services firms - TCS, Infosys and Wipro - continued to deliver strong growth in the period.

This was driven by continued demand for digital services, as enterprises across the world opened up their purse strings to virtualise in the face of the virus. Going by executive and analyst commentary, the momentum will continue in the coming quarter as well.

Here's a look at how the firms fared in the December quarter.

Revenue

While TCS and Infosys's revenue rates were ahead of market estimates at 3 and 6.3 percent sequential growth respectively, Wipro missed the estimates clocking 2.3 percent growth. However, all the three companies are bullish and expect to end the year with double digit growth.

Infosys increased its guidance for the third time this financial year to 19.5-20 percent, from 16.5-17.5 percent. The company had started the year with a guidance of 12-14 percent. Brokerage Motilal Oswal in its note said, “While we anticipated a more modest guidance raise, growth in the December quarter will ensure that FY22 revenue growth will again beat its latest guidance by 100 basis points. Good revenue growth in the second half of FY22 will also help it deliver high teen growth in FY23, which would be viewed positively by investors.”

Deal pipeline

One of the key trends emerging over the last few quarters is the companies beginning to see a mix of large, medium and small size deals, instead of mega deals of over $500 million.

For instance, in December 2020, Wipro won a $700 million deal with the German firm Metro AG, and Infosys signed its largest ever deal in history with Daimler last year. However, such deals are largely missing from the the last few quarters.

Thierry Delaporte, CEO of Wipro, said during the earnings call that while the mega deals are lacking, deals are coming in chunks instead of one large deal as was the case earlier. As a result, companies are seeing a mix of small, medium and large deals.

According to analysts, the healthy deal pipeline, even in the absence of mega deals, is a positive trend.

Attrition

With IT demand so high, technology professionals are more sought after than ever before, and companies are fighting over the limited talent pool, especially in the area of new-age digital skills. This war for talent is one of the biggest challenges for the companies. TCS, Infosys and Wipro reported 15.3 percent, 25.5 percent and 22.7 percent attrition respectively for the quarter ended December 2021. This is after recording one of the lowest rates in the beginning of 2021.

In recent interactions, multiple executives and recruiters have shared that attrition is likely to continue, but is expected to stabilise as more freshers join the productive workforce. An executive with a mid-tier IT firm pointed out that employee churn is expected to come down by mid-2022.

Hiring

All this is resulting in increased hiring by the IT companies. Three IT companies -- TCS, Infosys and Wipro -- added a record 1.7 lakh employees for 2021, a multi-fold increase from the 31,000 they had hired in 2020.

In the December 2021 quarter alone, the three companies added 50,000 employees, and 1.34 lakh employees between April and December 2021. As demand continues to outstrip supply, and till the fresher workforce becomes productive, this hiring momentum will continue.

This probably explains the record fresher pipeline this year. At 17,500, Wipro’s fresher hiring is 70 percent more than what the company hired in FY21. Infosys will hire 55,000 freshers in FY22, and TCS has on-boarded a record 78,000 campus recruits so far.

Margins

Operating margins for the IT majors have come down due to rising costs of hiring, subcontracting, and retaining employees. However, this should improve with better pricing for some of the short-term projects.

With the cost of talent with digital skills increasing, all the three IT majors indicated better pricing for projects. TCS in its commentary said that while it will retain the pricing for the long-term projects, it is seeing an uptick in pricing.

Salil Parekh, CEO, Infosys, said that while pricing remains stable for now, it is likely to change in the coming quarters.",726,0.4625681851591383

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) delivered yet another quarter of stellar performance driven by broad-based growth across verticals and geographies, new client additions, strong deal pipeline and the continued shift of organisations the world over towards cloud transformation.

India’s largest IT services company and the second most valuable firm in terms of market capitalisation on January 12 reported a 12.3 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in consolidated net profit to Rs 9,769 crore for the quarter. The sequential growth in net profit was recorded at 1.5 percent.

It also reported a 16.4 percent on-year growth in consolidated revenue to Rs 48,885 crore. On a sequential basis, its consolidated revenues increased by 4.3 percent.

Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan was upbeat about the company’s performance which is backed by strong customer relationships. He said, “Customers love our engagement model, our end-to-end capability, and our can-do approach to problem solving”.

He added further that “while mapping out their innovation and growth journeys, we are also helping them execute new-age operating model transformations to support those journeys”.

Here are the key takeaways from the IT giant’s performance in this quarter:

Broad-based growth

TCS witnessed a strong broad-based growth across all business verticals and geographies. All its verticals grew in mid-to-high teens during the quarter.

The company achieved a significant milestone by clocking revenues of USD 25 billion on a calendar year basis in CY2021. This was a result of very strong growth over the previous four quarters.

This quarter, the company witnessed the strongest growth in Q3 in the last five years. Constant currency revenue growth for the company stood at 15.4 percent on a yearly basis and 4 percent on a sequential basis.

Strong momentum continues in new deal TCVs

The company registered new deal TCVs (total contract value) of USD 7.6 billion during the quarter. This is a growth of 12 percent from USD 6.8 billion TCV signed during the corresponding period of last year.

The management said that the company continues to witness strong momentum for cloud adoption with customers embarking on multi-horizon cloud transformation journeys, thereby enabling its hyper-scale business units to outperform consistently.

Improved Client Matrix

TCS added 10 new clients in the USD 100 million-plus bracket, taking the total number of such clients to 58. It added 21 clients in USD 50 million bracket, thereby taking the total to 118 from 97. As many as 98 new clients were added in the USD 1million plus bracket.

These client additions are representative of strong demand momentum and how customers have rewarded TCS with more business across quarters, said Gopinathan.

Hiring continues in top gear with diversity in focus

The industry as a whole continues to face supply-side challenges. The company was able to restrict its attrition rate at 15.3 percent which is much lower than its industry peers. The management sees the attrition bottoming out in the coming quarters which will also result in optimisation of margins going forward.

The net additions during the quarter stood at 28,238 associated which was the highest ever added till date in a single quarter.

In the first half of the current financial year, TCS hired 43,000 freshers. It had given a guidance of hiring another 34,000 freshers during the second half. This target has already been achieved in the third quarter and the company expects further additions of campus recruits to its workforce in the fourth quarter.

To retain the in-house talent, the company has handed out 110,000 promotions so far this year and it plans to promote additional 40,000 resources in Q4.

Chief Human Resource Officer Milind Lakkad commented: “By continuing to invest in our people, giving preference to internal candidates for the most exciting open positions, providing global deployment opportunities, fast track career paths linked to learning, and promotions to over 110,000 employees, we have been able to retain our best talent and overcome supply-side challenges”.

The company crossed an important milestone of 200,000 women associates with 200,271 women employees at the end of the quarter. This means that women now constitute 36 percent of its workforce. The number of women executives at senior levels increased by 68 percent during the five year period from 2016-21.

Expectations from stock

The broad-based growth achieved during the quarter and the continuation of growth momentum in coming quarters which is backed by a robust deal pipeline are strong positives for TCS stock.

Moreover, the company has announced a massive buyback of Rs 18,000 crore at a price of Rs 4,500 per share. The quantum of buyback is much more than street’s expectations. The buyback rate is at a premium of approximately 16.7 percent over the last traded price which is also over and above street’s expectations.

Based on the results outcome and the buyback premium, experts expect the stock to react positively tomorrow. Overall they are optimistic about the stock with medium to long term horizon.",818,0.9040587941805521

India’s largest IT services company TCS now employs two lakh women, with the gender diversity increasing by 68 percent at the senior leadership level during 2016-21, the company said on January 12.

In the company’s Q3 FY22 earnings report, TCS said, “TCS crossed a new milestone in its diversity journey in Q3, with the number of women in its workforce crossing 200,000.” This translates to 35 percent of the workforce in TCS being women. TCS employs 556,986 people as on December 31, 2021.

Moneycontrol earlier reported that TCS had 13 percent women at the leadership level. While Infosys has 39.6 percent women employees, it does not give details about the number of women at the senior level. Cognizant crossed 1 lakh women in the workforce a few years ago.

In recent times, diversity, both gender and ethnicity, has been a key focus for major IT companies.

TCS in the statement said, “The policy of hiring local talent across the world has resulted in a globally distributed workforce comprising 156 nationalities.”

Thierry Delaporte, CEO, Wipro, told media persons during the earnings call on January 12 that both ethnic and gender diversity improved, with the latter doubling for the firm.

While women account for almost half of the workforce in the junior levels, the numbers come down as they move up the career ladder. One of the key issues has been the talent pipeline. While women constitute as much as 50 percent at the entry level, this number comes down as they move to mid-management level and above due to reasons such as marriage and childbirth.

However, companies are taking cognizance of the issue and are looking at multiple ways to improve the number. This includes consciously promoting women to the top.

VV Apparao, Chief Human Resources Officer, HCL Tech said in an earlier interaction, “We are conscious that we need to grow our leadership ranks in terms of women leaders. (Because) we are nowhere close to the 50 percent mark.”

That is the reason, according to Apparao, that the company has many programmes to train women and get them leadership roles. This includes promotions across levels.

“Every time there is a promotion cycle we pose a question to the leaders - why not women. If somebody is performing well and has got good ratings in the last 2-3 years, we ask why they are not being promoted and they have to give a plausible answer as to why they are not doing,” he explained.",423,0.47596557438373566

Milind Lakkad, Chief HR Officer at TCS, said in a statement, "" We continue to set new records in talent acquisition. In addition to the 43,000 freshers we hired in H1, we on-boarded 34,000 fresh graduates in Q3 – which is higher than our full year fresher hiring numbers in prior years.""

""On the talent retention side, we continue to be the industry benchmark.

However, attrition continues to be a challenge. The company’s attrition increased to 15.3 percent in the quarter, from 8.6 percent in the beginning of the year and 11.9 percent in the September 2021 quarter.

TCS registered Rs 48,885 crore in revenues for the quarter, up 16.3 percent year-on-year (YoY) and Rs 9,769 crore in net profit, a 12.3 percent YoY growth. Total contract value for the quarter stood at $7.6 billion, up 12 percent from Q3 FY21.

Tata Consultancy Services, India’s largest IT service provider, and rivals Infosys and Wipro will kick off the third-quarter earnings season by declaring their results on January 12.

Although the December quarter is seasonally weak for the IT sector due to the year end holidays, experts said most companies may report steady sequential revenue growth on the back of secular, broad-based demand trends, healthy deal wins and active mergers and acquisitions.

Overall demand remains strong, driven by strong client requirements for digital, cloud, data analytics, 5G, Internet of Things, cyber security and artificial intelligence projects.

Consolidated profit after tax for TCS may jump by 14.5 percent on a yearly basis to Rs 9,965 crore in the third quarter of FY22 (October-December), while consolidated revenue is expected to increase by 15.6 percent to Rs 48,545 crore, experts said.

The company reported profit of Rs 8,701 crore and revenue of Rs 42,015 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Consolidated profit was Rs 9,624 crore and revenue stood at Rs 46,867 crore in the previous quarter (July-September) of FY22.

Views from the street

Top line

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal forecasts a 2.4 percent sequential jump in dollar revenue to $6,482 million, while in rupee terms, revenue is expected to grow by 4.6 percent to Rs 49,000 crore. This works out to a year-on-year growth of 16.6 percent.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 14.7 percent on-year growth in revenue to Rs 48,200 crore.

“December is a seasonally weak quarter. impacted by furloughs. We expect modest sequential revenue growth of 2.8 percent,” Kotak said in its report. Growth will be broad-based and moderation in YoY growth is expected as the benefits of a low base fade, it said.

“We build in 1.9 percent QoQ USD revenue growth, factoring in ~80 bps cross-currency headwinds,” Emkay Research said in its report. It expects revenue at Rs 42,015 crore, a growth of 15.2 percent YoY and 3.3 percent sequentially.

One basis point (bps) is one-hundredth of a percent.

Deal wins

Deal wins may be stable compared with those in the previous quarter, with experts expecting a total contract value (TCV) of $7.5 billion. Most deals will likely be mid-sized and small contracts.

“We expect $7.5 billion of TCV, powered by mid-sized deals. We do not expect any skew in TCV from mega-deals,” Kotak said. It added that the TCV will grow 10 percent YoY and could be little changed sequentially.

Margin expectations

Experts said margins may contract on a yearly basis, but they have mixed expectations on their sequential growth.

Motilal Oswal expects the EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margin at 28.2 percent in the third quarter from 29.1 percent last year. On a sequential basis, it expects the EBITDA margin to expand by 20 basis points from 28 percent in the previous quarter.

“Expect sequential expansion in margin, led by SG&A (selling, general & administrative expense) leverage,” the brokerage added.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 125 bps YoY reduction in the EBITDA margin to 27.8 percent. On a sequential basis, it expects a margin contraction of 18 bps.

“We forecast sequential and YoY decline in EBIT margin courtesy of investments, increase in discretionary costs and high cost to backfill attrition,” it said.

Emkay Research expects the EBITDA margin to contract 98 bps on a yearly basis to 28.1 percent. However, sequentially, the margin is expected to improve by 9 bps.

“EBIT margin is likely to expand 20 bps QoQ due to flattening employee pyramid, higher offshoring, and revenue growth-led operating leverage,” Emkay said.

Bottom line performance

Profit for TCS in the quarter is forecast to grow in a range of 11 percent to 17 percent on a YoY basis.

According to Motilal Oswal, profit may climb 17.1 percent on a yearly basis to Rs 10,200 crore, which is up 6 percent on a sequential basis.

Emkay expects a 14.4 percent YoY and 3.4 percent QoQ growth and forecasts earnings of Rs 9,951 crore.

Kotak is more conservative and expects YoY growth of 10.8 percent in profit to Rs 9,645 crore. On a sequential basis, this works out to 0.2 percent growth.

In focus

Experts will look for the views of TCS on a range of factors, including the durability of growth and the magnitude of opportunity from the aggressive shift to the cloud by clients and the medium- to long-term growth outlook.

They will also want to know about the company’s expectations on demand trends in key verticals such as banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), retail, manufacturing and communications; reasons for lack of large deal momentum; pricing environment; margin outlook; supply-side challenges and attrition, and indications on IT spending for CY2022.

The TCS stock gained 0.9 percent to Rs 3,915.90 at the close on the National Stock Exchange on January 11. It generated returns of 23.3 percent in the past year and 4.8 percent during this financial year. The stock gained 7.7 percent in the past one month.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's largest IT services company, on January 7 announced that its board of directors will consider a share buyback proposal on January 12. The software services major is already slated to release its Q3FY21 (October-December period) results on that day.

""Pursuant to Regulation 29(1 )(b) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, this is to inform you that the Board of Directors will consider a proposal for buyback of equity shares of the Company, at its meeting to be held on January 12, 2022,"" TCS said in a stock exchange filing.

That apart, TCS will also consider declaration of third interim dividend to the equity shareholders during the board meeting.

This will be the fourth buyback by the IT bellwether. Before this, TCS has conducted three buybacks in its history - in 2017, 2018 and 2020. Interestingly, all the three buybacks have been of Rs 16,000 crore.

India's largest IT firm had reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,624 crore for the quarter ended September 2021 (Q2FY22), registering a 14.1 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth, driven by broad-based demand and resilient margins.

The government has again selected India's largest IT firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for the next phase of the Passport Seva Programme.

TCS had bagged a Rs 1,000 crore deal for the first phase from the ministry of external affairs in 2008.

While TCS did not disclose the value of the renewed deal, the contract could be worth Rs 8,000 crore according to an industry analyst.

“In the next phase, TCS will refresh existing facilities and systems, and develop innovative new solutions to enable the issuance of e-passports and further enhance the citizen experience using technologies such as biometrics, artificial intelligence, advance data analytics, chatbots, auto-response, natural language processing, and the cloud,” the company said in a statement.

In the first phase, TCS digitised the processes and sped up the timeline to get passports, among others. Some of the critical e-governance projects that TCS runs include Passport Seva Kendra, India Post and IRCTC.

Tej Bhatla, business unit head, public sector, TCS, said in the statement, “Our partnership with the ministry over the last decade has become a benchmark in public-private partnership for citizen services.""

Implementing government projects is a challenge for IT companies due to a host of factors such as undefined scope, inflexible milestones, and delay in payments.

On the TCS’s success in cracking government projects, operations chief N Ganapathy Subramaniam had said in an earlier interview with Moneycontrol: ""Government projects not just in India but around the world are different. They are highly process-centric and there will also be a lot of exacting demands from them in terms of performance guarantees and liabilities.”",293,0.3331743876139323

When the pandemic struck in 2020, travel was one of the worst-affected sectors as countries went into lockdown restricting travel. However, recent times have seen travel resuming.

Girish Ramachandran, President of TCS Asia Pacific, in a recent interaction said that going by the industry estimates, global air travel will reach 88 percent of its pre-COVID levels in 2022. “We don’t know whether much of it is true because of what is happening on the Omicron front but you know we expect that if at least people have started travelling around.”

However, this means that the airlines and airports have to reimagine how people travel. Ramachandran explained that with the pandemic, needs of customers have changed, and the current way of customer experience, which involves multiple partners in the airline and airport ecosystem, has been a threat.

This is opening up opportunities for IT companies in the aviation sector. A case-in-point is the multi-million-dollar deal the company has signed with the Hong Kong-based Plaza Premium Group (PPG), which is in the airport services space, to transform the airport experience.

Through this partnership, TCS will develop an end-to-end digital platform, Passenger Services Technology for PPG, to improve customer experience and operational excellence at its 70 airport locations that serve 20 million passengers annually. The idea is also to reimagine the end-to-end airport travel experience across three core areas of customer experience, employee experience, and operational excellence.

TCS is piloting this in the Bengaluru airport across 32 services. Over a period of time, this service will be expanded to other parts of the world, he added. Apart from airport services, the company is also looking at opportunities in customer experience, and cloudification in aviation.

Air India could provide opportunities as well in terms of digitisation. The Tata group won the Air India bid for Rs 18,000 crore on October 8. It has been like a homecoming moment for the salt-to-software conglomerate, which founded Air India, but gave control to the government 68 years ago.

Commenting on opportunities particularly from Air India, Ramachandran said, “I cannot speak a lot about Air India because it will come on to the Tata Group only in January. But, all of us are very, very nostalgic about Air India. All of us know the brand and the loyalty that all of the Air India commands over many of us who’ve been flying it across from India and we also know that as Rajesh would have mentioned, we work with a lot of airlines around the world and we understand the art of possible especially with respect to digitisation and that is an area where we definitely think Air India will invest in over a period of time.”

For PPG, which runs airports across India in cities like Delhi, Hyderabad, and Chennai, the opportunities are huge.

Ali Bora Isbulan, Chief Commercial Officer, Plaza Premium Group, pointed out that India itself could be a huge potential for the firm. With the Airports Authority of India opening up in terms of the regulations to encourage the PPG projects along with the semi-owned private ownership of the airport and air traffic in India increasing, PPG sees more opportunities.

“We have been in India for more than 10 years in major airports. With 2021 and beyond, we are going to make a lot of investments into the airport, not only in Bangaluru, Delhi and Hyderabad, but I’m sure we're going to be in Mumbai soon,” Isbulan said.",609,0.5419610407617357

Telecom operator Bharti Airtel and IT major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) have joined hands to build a 5G-based remote working technology using robotics, according to sources. Both the companies are currently running the trials in Airtel’s 5G lab at Manesar, Haryana.

""Indian companies are looking to adopt indigenously developed technology for 5G. Airtel and TCS have joined hands for remote robotics operations using 5G. They have successfully conducted trials in Airtel’s 5G lab, a source told PTI.

These solutions will enable remote robotic operations in potentially hazardous environments like mining, oil & gas fields etc, the source said.

Both the companies have interest in deploying these solutions in industrial segments, once the commercial roll out of 5G starts, the source noted. When contacted, TCS declined to comment as they are going through a silent period and an email query sent to Bharti Airtel did not elicit any reply.

In June, Airtel and TCS announced a strategic partnership for implementing 5G network solutions for India. Tata Group has developed O-RAN (Open Radio Access Network)-based Radio and core elements and integrated a totally indigenous telecom stack, while Airtel will pilot and deploy this indigenous solution as part of its 5G rollout plans in India.

Open RAN or open radio access network architecture is an industry terminology for interoperability and standardisation of radio access network elements including products and software from various vendors.

The commercial deployment of Tata Group developed O-RAN was to start from January 2022, but uncertainty around it remains because of deferment in the 5G spectrum auction plan of the government. The government has extended the 5G trial period till May 2022.",282,0.9975649118423462

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCS

IT services companies should see acceleration in structural growth over the medium term as corporates embark on a multi-year cloud-led upgrade cycle. This shift in the business model should lead to a substantial increase (5% revenue v/s 3% historically) in the tech budgets of enterprise clients, adding 5-6% incremental growth for the industry. Growth in the cloud would anchor this phase of technology spending, which would see a mid to high teen growth rate. Along with continued double-digit growth in digital services, this should more than compensate for the decline in traditional services. In our view, TCS is among the best positioned companies to benefit from this structural spending uptick, and hence are upgrading the stock to Buy rating. We expect TCS to benefit from the sustained growth given its 1) strong organic capabilities, 2) diverse vertical and geographic presence, 3) deal win momentum, and 4) strong headcount additions.



Outlook

We are turning positive on the company given the strong growth potential. Our TP of INR4,220 implies 30x FY24E EPS. We upgrade our rating to Buy.

November 26 marks the first death anniversary of the Indian IT titan FC Kohli, the first CEO of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). He pioneered the growth and construction of the $100 billion+ Indian IT behemoth TCS, taking it to new heights. The company, which, as of 2021, is the largest IT services company in the world by market capitalization, has come to define not just the Tata groups but India’s Information technology sector as well.

Kohli was also instrumental in bringing IBM to India, under the 1991 Tata-IBM joint venture, which aimed towards the extension of hardware manufacturing and support in the country. Notably, TCS, which began with a few hundred professionals under his leadership, has now grown to a 5,28,000 strong network of employees.

TCS to build digital workplace on cloud for Swiss Re

The father of India’s software industry, Kohli, who passed away in 2020, constantly emphasised the need for evolution, not just in terms of learning, but also for acceptance of new technologies. FC Kohli, who joined Tata Electric Co in 1951 to set up the country’s first load dispatch center, was asked by JRD Tata to establish TCS in 1969.

In an interview with Moneycontrol earlier, the technocrat who held JRD Tata in very high regard, mentioned, “Changes occur constantly and are not specific to one period but the way that technology is moving and the way people are gaining knowledge is vastly different from my time. The educational institution is very different from what I got and it means that it is easier today to gain knowledge and then build your career. It's not a starting point with an ending point. This country has to update education and teaching methods—one has to learn how to change.”

Post retiring in 1999 at the age of 75, Kohli remained quite active well into his 90s as well, working on an adult literacy program in multiple languages, which he calls his “biggest contribution” to the country. Designed especially for those who had no prior experience in reading, the program reportedly benefited the concerned individuals, leading to a rise in the literacy levels overall.

On his advice to younger cadres of CEOs and individuals, Kohli believed that the whole world is open for learning and one must keep learning and studying for the future so that one can contribute effectively not just to the industry they belong in, but also to the country in general.

On the occasion, Mr. K. Ananth Krishnan, Chief Technology Officer said “I have learned so much over the last 32 years from the legendary Mr. Faqir Chand Kohli. I used to run into him often while working out of our office in the Air India Building at Nariman point, in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He was a courteous host and would personally pour the tea for you when you visit his office.

Top five Indian IT firms added 1.7 lakh employees between January and September

He was amazingly updated on technology and very passionate about several things like the Indian language, computing, hardware, electronics, using technology for social good, and helping the smaller academic institutions. And of course, his humor was remarkable! He has done so much and inspired so many people. But there is one specific area that I would call out, which is dear to my heart- TCS Research & Innovation. He was the primary mover behind the setting up of TCS Research and Innovation. It would be my pride if we can live up to his expectations, and make his vision come to life”.",617,0.9999713102976481

The Union Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on November 11 launched the e-governance for Civil Aviation (e-GCA) online platform through which the aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation will provide 298 services including pilot licensing and medical examination.

The online platform will provide services to various DGCA stakeholders such as Pilots, Aircraft Maintenance Engineers, Air Traffic Controllers, Air Operators, Airport Operators, Flying Training Organizations, Maintenance and Design organizations, among others.

The launch of the e-GCA project under DGCA was part of the minister's 100-day plan for the aviation sector. The portal was developed by Tata Consultancy Services.

The DGCA has been transferring its services online for the last four years now and the launch of the online portal now completes the transfer of most of the regulator's services online.

''And through this transformation (DGCA to e-GCA), we have achieved a number of objectives of becoming a single-window online service platform, eliminating procedural inefficiencies and automating regulatory reporting,'' Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

The minister said that through the launch of the new online platform all DGCA clearance can now be attained through a single window.

Medical clearance for pilots will now be done in 2-3 days, which earlier used to take at least a month, he added. For pilots' licenses, earlier things used to happen offline which is now being moved online, he further informed.

During the launch, the Union Minister of Civil Aviation also unveiled a case study ‘DGCA takes off on a digital flight’, which captures the journey of DGCA through the implementation of the eGCA. The challenges that DGCA faced and the measures taken to address these through the eGCA platform have been incorporated in this case study.",562,0.7545553743839264

Top five IT services companies – TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra – together added close to 1.7 lakh people in the first nine months of this year on the back of strong demand and rising attrition.

The recovery is all the more striking, since it comes after headcount in the top five IT firms declined by 1,125 during the same period last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Back in March 2020, countries went into lockdown and IT firms paused hiring, both freshers and laterals, as they braced for volatility. The top five companies’ headcount addition was 77,000 between January and September 2019.

A year later, there is a complete turnaround, in terms of both hiring and the demand.

Hiring and demand

Demand is at an all-time high and supply chain constraint is a key challenge across the industry.

For one, attrition has gone up across the industries. Infosys, Wipro and Tech Mahindra reported attrition rate of over 20 percent for the quarter ended September 2021, up from the previous quarters. Saurabh Govil, chief human resources officer, Wipro, said during the earnings call on October 13 that the high attrition rate is likely for the next couple of quarters, given that the market is hot right now.

It is not just large IT services companies that are looking at a spike in attrition rates, mid-tier IT companies and also clients are in the same predicament.

Sanjay Jalona, CEO, L&T Infotech, in a recent interaction with Moneycontrol, said, “In what the world is calling a ‘Great Resignation’, the US itself has a million openings. Unemployment is only at 7.5 percent. So, the deficit in talent availability is causing them to have huge attrition.”

He further explained, “Our customers are seeing double-digit attrition numbers and they’re looking to partners like us. They are also automating a lot of things because of the shortage of labour. All these three things put together are creating a need for more tech services and jobs. We are just happy to be here participating in this with our customers.” LTI reported an attrition rate of 19.6 percent.

So the companies are hiring in large numbers to cater to the clients’ needs.

Spike in hiring

Hiring, without a doubt, is at an all-time high in recent years and the outlook for the next two quarters looks strong. In the quarter ending September 2021 alone, the top five IT majors added close to 70,000 people. It was 18,000 last year and 37,000 for the quarter ended September 2019.

Most of the IT firms have revised their fresher hiring targets for the year given the sustained demand. TCS increased their fresher hiring numbers from 40,000 it had announced early this year to 78,000 for FY22. Infosys will hire 45,000 freshers this fiscal, up from 26,000 it had announced in the beginning of this fiscal. Wipro will hire 17,000 freshers up from 12,000 it had earlier announced.

This would take total fresher hiring to 1.6 lakh in FY22.

With the momentum expected to continue, some firms have announced they will be doubling their fresher hiring in FY23 as well. Wipro and HCL Tech said they would be hiring 25,000-30,000 freshers in FY23.",564,-0.19891510009765626

Jeffrey Goh, CEO of Star Alliance, the world’s largest grouping of airlines in terms of passengers carried, says it is good that the Air India (AI) disinvestment is finally through to “provide certainty for AI and also for its partners and, obviously, importantly the partners within the Star Alliance.”

Established in 1997, the association currently offers more than 19,000 daily flights to over 1,300 airports in 195 countries. It includes 26 global carriers such as AI, Lufthansa, United Airlines and Singapore Airlines.

In a conversation with Moneycontrol from the Star Alliance headquarters in Frankfurt, Goh added that AI going to the Tatas “will remove AI from any form of government involvement. It will provide AI with more autonomy in terms of investments in products and services.”

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) accounts for the largest outgo globally for the group. “I hope this partnership that we have with TCS will also enable a swifter technology transformation and digital transformation at AI,” Goh said.

Goh has worn various hats including being the senior legal counsel, International Air Transport Association (IATA), and has also been a lecturer of law at the universities of Liverpool and Sheffield. He has been heading Star Alliance since 2017. Here are the edited excerpts:

What are your views on the AI divestment?

It is good to see that it has been brought to a conclusion to provide certainty for AI and also for its partners and, obviously, the partners within Star Alliance.

How will AI going to the Tatas help the alliance partners?

First, it will remove AI from any form of government involvement. Partnerships are going to be determined more on a commercial basis. It will provide AI with more autonomy in terms of investments in products and services that will bring in congruency for many of the products and services of our members within the alliance.

The divestment has also opened the door for investments, in a way, to bring many of AI’s products and services to an enhanced level.

So can Star Alliance members hope to find products in AI similar to what they find on other partners?

We will never find identical products and services or identical products and service levels but I think what this does, is give AI the opportunity to invest more in its products and services, to enhance them.

It will never be the same across the alliance. But what it does is give AI the autonomy to invest in enhancing its products and services.

What is lacking right now?

We are focused on improving the digital customer experience. For example, AI investing in its digital transformation, bringing in technology and getting its digital platforms enhanced.

There are also opportunities in terms of on-board experience that AI can invest in to upgrade its products whether it is hardware or software.

When AI was under the government, did you find any reluctance or red tape in getting the enhancements that you are expecting now?

I think as a publicly owned enterprise, AI counting on government funds and investments ran into competing interests and competing investments. Governments have other priorities and with those competing interests the case has to be very overwhelming and sometimes it is difficult to pour money into investing in a product upgrade, for instance.

Will you look at having a carrier other than AI from India as a member?

For better or for worse the COVID-19 crisis has set us back several steps. At the moment it is too early to determine not only in India but globally where we may think of expanding membership, because the coronavirus crisis has impacted the industry so much that our members are and have been recalibrating their fleet and networks.

Because of the changes that have taken place and are still taking place, it is too early to say now whether we would necessarily be looking for members in India or anywhere else to add to the network.

So there is a freeze on membership for some time to come?

I think we are, have been and will continue to be selective about who will be a member of the alliance. There is no timeline in terms of a freeze if tomorrow, next week or next month an airline was to approach us and was able to offer a value proposition from our analysis. We will certainly be interested in pursuing that conversation.

Has any airline from India approached the alliance?

We are in constant conversations not only in India but everywhere else. Some conversations progress to a second conversation, some conversations stop in their tracks. At this stage there is no specific airline in the second conversation in India and globally.

How is the alliance footprint in India in terms of sourcing of IT?

It is a matter of public record that TCS which is part of the Tata group is a strategic partner of the alliance.

Could that bring any spinoff benefits to the new AI now owned by the Tatas?

I hope there will be more synergies. I hope this partnership that we have with TCS will also enable a swifter technology transformation and digital transformation at AI. AI knows that we are always there to support it for a better customer experience and if our partnership with TCS can help generate those improvements, we are ready to support AI together with TCS.",1175,0.7894583344459534

Bengaluru-based IT major Wipro, which had already started getting senior executives back to office in September, will accelerate the initiative from January 2022 as the vaccination gains pace, said a top executive.

The company has 50 percent of the employees doubly vaccinated and 85 percent have got at least one dose. Wipro started getting senior executives to office twice a week from September.

Speaking to media persons announcing the company’s Q2 FY22 results, Saurabh Govil, chief human resources office, Wipro, said, “We have made a start (on return to office) and I think it's a very welcome change.”

Stating that employees are very keen to come to office, Govil explained that the company will further accelerate the return to office initiative at the senior leadership level in the coming quarter, where the company is going to ask people who are doubly vaccinated and are keen to come across bands, to start coming to offices.

“From January onwards, hoping the pandemic is settling on well, we will gradually increase the participation of people on premises. We believe it will really strengthen the engagement and teamwork as we get people back into offices or even a gradual process with employee health and safety being the priority,” he added.

Wipro reported $2.58 billion in revenue for the quarter ended September 2021, up 6.9 percent on a sequential basis. The company has guided for the sequential growth of 2-4 percent for Q3 FY22. The company added over 11,475 employees in the quarter ending September 2021, taking the total employee count to 221,365.

After 18 months of working from home, IT companies are looking to get employees back to campuses with vaccination gaining pace. TCS recently said that it is looking to get 80 percent of the employees to work by 2022 and is encouraging vaccinated employees to come to offices from November and December 2021.",323,0.978223904967308

Tata Consultancy Services, India’s largest software firm, wants to get a majority of its employees back to the office by December, after 18 months of working from home, as the company implements its hybrid work model.

The move appears contradictory to the company’s ‘25 by 25’ strategy announced at the height of the pandemic last year, envisioning only 25 percent of its employees working in the office by 2025. However, there is a rationale for this move.

According to a top TCS executive, bringing employees back to the office first will be key to implementing its hybrid strategy in a phased manner. It will help employees connect and build social capital before they start working virtually again.

TCS currently has over 528,000 employees, of which 70 percent are fully vaccinated and 95 percent have received their first dose.

TCS announced the strategy early last year when IT companies were forced to enable work from home for their employees in the wake of the pandemic. With customers warming up to the idea and mindsets changing, TCS was the first to announce its permanent remote work strategy.

With this model, the company expects only 25 percent of its associates will need to work out of its facilities at any point of time by 2025. Also, employees won’t need to spend more than 25 percent of their time in the office. Going by the current headcount, only 132,000 people would work from office by 2025.

Return to office

However, Milind Lakkad, chief human resources officer at TCS, said that while the company stands by its 25 by 25 vision, it doesn’t mean all the work will be remote. From the current 95-98 percent working remotely, it first wants to get 80-85 percent of employees back to the office.

The company will encourage senior employees and those who are fully vaccinated to come to the campus. Some executives from the management and delivery sides have been working in the office over the past few weeks and this number will be stepped up slowly.

“We will come back to normal first before we go to the new normal,” Lakkad explained. “When I say come to normal first, we will get most of our workers to offices first. Most of our seniors have already started coming to work at least two to three times a week. Towards the end of this year, we will try to get the larger workforce gradually into our offices.”

Building social capital

However, the company doesn’t expect to reach the 80 percent target by December, considering that most employees are away in their hometowns and it would take time for them to return. Lakkad said the company aims to get 80 percent of the employees in 2022 before the proportion is narrowed.

“(It can be) 60 percent in 2023 and 40 percent in 2024. It would be 25 percent by 2025. So that is the path we will take, depending on individual aspects and customer situation. At the macro level, that is how we will realise this vision and we are committed to it. But to ensure that after these 18 months of working virtually, it is very important to just come back to work and build that social capital and then slowly move on to the 25 by 25 model,” he explained.

Pausing campus development

The impact of the 25 by 25 policy will mean the development of new campuses will be slow. Each building will have 50 percent occupancy because of the current Covid-19 protocols that need to be followed.

“Taking into consideration employee safety and all the other things, we will at best have 50 percent of the workforce at any point in time. So our offices currently can operate only at 50-60 percent capacity at any point in time in terms of people coming into offices,” chief operating officer NG Subramaniam said in an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol.

While certain employees, like those working on the infrastructure server, might be required to come to office frequently, project managers can take a call on how often they need to come to the office, based on customer needs.

“We left it to the units and the project managers whether you want to work two days a week, one week, a month, or let’s say one month, and then the next two months you go offline… That’s up to you to see how you want to manage this. Plus, there are always situations like separate client visits. So, there is a certain amount of plasticity and flexibility, but on average we believe that the 25 by 25 model will pan out,” he added.

Peers Infosys and Wipro are also looking at a hybrid model. While Wipro said its leaders have started coming to office twice a week, Infosys COO UB Pravin said it may see 20-30 percent of the workforce coming to office over the next six months if the impact of a third wave of Covid-19 is minimal.",853,-0.9522187113761902

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCS

TCS reported an in line revenue growth of 4% QoQ CC in 2QFY22. However, USD revenue growth (2.9% QoQ) missed our estimate of 3.7% QoQ growth. EBIT margin expanded by 10bp QoQ to 25.6%, but was lower than our estimate of 26.2%, on supply side challenges. PAT stood at INR97b, up 6.9% QoQ, aided by higher other income and stable ETR. The company reported an OCF/PAT of 103% and a FCF/PAT of 97% on good working capital management, indicating the ability to generate strong cash flow. 1HFY22 USD Revenue/EBIT/PAT grew 19.1%/20.6%/28.4% YoY.



Outlook

We remain positive on the company, given its strong growth outlook. But high valuations leave limited room for disappointment. A miss on estimates in 2QFY22, coupled with a soft margin outlook, can result in near term pressure on the stock. Our TP of INR3,770 per share implies 31x FY23E EPS. We maintain our Neutral rating.

Despite facing short-term volatilities like higher attrition, Tata Consultancy Services will continue to invest as per business requirements and not look at protecting profit margins, a senior official has said.

The company, however, continues to be focused on the 26-28 percent operating profit margin band and has its structures aligned towards achieving the aspirational band, its chief financial officer Samir Seksaria underlined.

""(as we see) short-term volatilities, it is not that we will do things only to protect the margins. Whatever the investments are required, whatever is the right thing to do we will continue to invest. In the short term, we are not looking at… the short-term focus will be to feed the needs of the business as far as possible,"" Seksaria told PTI.

In the September quarter, the largest software exporter reported margins at 25.6 percent and stated the possibility of short-term volatilities on this front like supply-side constraints as the attrition goes up, currency headwinds and the possibility of demand getting impacted due to future waves of pandemic.

The company, which employs over 5 lakh people, also reported an increase in attrition at 11.9 percent.

""Currently, the short-term volatility is in terms of supply-side challenges mainly due to elevated attritions,"" Seksaria said, adding that in the quarter gone by, it also faced headwinds from currency,"" he said.

TCS has been able to manage better than peers on the supply side or human resources front because of its upfront investments even when demand had shown difficulties in the initial days of the pandemic, he added.

The same is seen in the 75,000 new hires done in the last one year, or over 43,000 hires in the first half of the ongoing FY22, he said.

The CFO said the company learnt from its experience of the global financial crisis of 2008, and expected demand to recover in a V-shape.

However, despite strong hiring, it was able to get employee costs down by 0.20 percent to 56.3 percent as it shifted tactics to hire more low-cost freshers, he said, making it clear that the company will continue to balance between freshers and laterals going forward.

""Our investments going forward are more in terms of competency building, strengthening research and innovation and intellectual property,"" he said.

Seksaria said the company had realigned investments between the three as per business demands and the overall investments were at the same levels.

He said there has not been any material impact on the costs because of the pandemic, even though there have been a few changes in some items.

From a deal flow perspective, the company continues to be positive, adding that the new deal signing has always ranged between USD 7-9 billion.

The company has invested Rs 1,250 crore in the first half of the fiscal for physical infrastructure and will continue with similar activities, he said, adding that in FY21 it had invested Rs 3,000 crore.",495,0.1468437143734523

Tata Consultancy Services , India’s largest software exporter, will hire a record 77,000 freshers in FY22, up from its initial estimate of 40,000, on the back of strong demand for its services and an unprecedented war for tech talent, which is leading to high attrition.

In an interview with Moneycontrol, the company’s chief human resources officer, Milind Lakkad, spoke about the demand for tech talent, the incentives it will roll out, how it plans to bring employees back to campus and why tapping more women and gig workers could become key in the way it manages talent. Edited excerpts:

TCS will onboard over 75,000 freshers this year, up from 40,000 you had shared earlier. Is it going to stop with that or do you perhaps expect it to touch the 1 lakh mark this year?For campus hiring, we have already done 43,000. We are looking at another 34,000. So close to 77,000 is what we’re looking at. We will look at the situation as the months go by and increase our numbers as the situation demands.



In terms of attrition, it is a six-quarter high… Attrition was 7.2 percent during the fourth quarter and 8.6 percent during the first. What is your comfort level here?

The 7.2 percent attrition was artificially lower because of the pandemic. We are normally operating at about 10-11 percent attrition, which has been the number for us many years. Our comfort level is ideally 12-13 percent, maybe another point up to 14 percent is our comfort level. It is a cause of concern, no doubt about it. But our strong employer branding, coupled with robust talent acquisition and development, is significantly yielding results for us. These (increased attrition) numbers, we believe, will stay at this level for the next two to three quarters, let us say till Q1 (FY23) and then it will start stabilising.



About lateral hiring, are the dropout rates still high at 40-50 percent, which is an average right now, from what we speak to recruiters?

I think the conversion rate has dropped a bit. I will not say it’s 50 percent for us. But we continue to make efforts to improve that as we go along. The overall compensation for bringing laterals has definitely increased for us marginally and it has always been the case. But the overall cost, we have managed it well through the current mix.



You are hiring a record 77,000 freshers this year. For the last couple of years you have been about 40,000 each year. How are you managing the whole process because the demand is pretty high at any given point of time and deployment of freshers will take time?

We have a programme where the kids in their seventh semester are put through the Xplore programme. They learn about technology, soft skills and, at times, even unit-specific training that happens such as cloud or security, which are in high demand right now. We continue to assess them obviously and this has all been done virtually for 18 months. It will continue to be like that even after the pandemic and we will bring in physical aspects as the situation normalises.

There are about 1,500 students taking one digital certification every week. As we go along, we also have built in something called incentives based on competency. There is basic compensation and if they are ready by the time we want them or before that, they get certain incentives… This adds to their compensation. We are even thinking of increasing these incentives significantly…

This engagement for 6-7 months, even before they join, which we call the shift-left strategy, is important. They are not just ready to join TCS, they are ready to actually join a specific business unit when they come in – all these aspects that require a significant amount of planning, execution, and investment. The volumes have gone from 40,000 to 75,000 and we will be able to manage this.



Given the war for talent, are you looking at giving another hike?

So we are the first company that announced hikes twice in a year last year right now. This year we want to obviously go back to our regular cycle and we will do the next cycle in April.



Will you look at doing different things to ramp up supply? Are you perhaps reaching out to your ex-employees from your database who may want to come back? We have heard anecdotally that it is harder for ex-employees to join the company. Will you be more flexible if they are keen to join?

We are looking into all these aspects. We have a database of people, you know, who have missed our qualifying test or just missed qualifying in our interview. We reach out to them and say, ‘Hey, you missed it last time, do you want to think about it again and we can help you cross that bar?’ So those kinds of things continue to happen. We have a person-of-interest database. These are the people who have a very high chance of coming to us again because they missed it last time or for whatever reason they could not join us. With respect to getting ex-employees, we will obviously look into that on an ongoing basis selectively.



Freshers’ salary has for most part remained stagnant at about Rs 3.5 LPA for close to a decade. We are aware that TCS has a different salary scale for those with digital skills. Are there any plans to increase the salary?

We want people to feel hungry, we want them to learn and we provide them all different pathways to get there. If you take digital, people get double the base salary at Rs 3.5 lakh per annum. If you want to reach there, we say come in and apply for it, you get three more chances within three years to get to that level.

We actually say that we allow associates to decide their own compensation. (We want the candidates to) demonstrate that hunger there. In Xplore, where we are paying differentially based on competency, we are thinking of increasing that component even more.



TCS is looking to get employees back in the office from December. Will you be doing it in phases because the campuses can run only at 50 percent capacity? Also, would there be compensation changes, with remote working becoming a permanent stay?

We believe in our 25 by 25 vision, but at the same time we do not believe in 100 percent remote work. (B y 2025, only 25 percent of the TCS workforce will work out of TCS facilities at any time.)

We will come back to normal first before we go to the new normal. When I say come to normal first, we will get most of our workers to offices first. Most of our seniors have already started coming to work at least two to three times a week. Towards the end of this year, we will try to get the larger workforce gradually into our offices.

Talking about 25 by 25 vision, it can be 80 percent in 2022, 60 percent in 2023 and 40 percent in 2024. It would be 25 percent by 2025. So that is the path we will take depending on individual aspects and customer situation. At the macro level, that is how we will realise this vision and we are committed to it. But to ensure that after these 18 months of working virtually, it is very important to just come back to work and build that social capital and then slowly move on to the 25 by 25 model. When it comes to compensation changes, we are not thinking about that at all, at least at this point in time.



What has happened over the last 1.5 years is that location was no longer a criteria to hire the right talent. You don’t have to map candidates to a city because of remote work. Is this going to change now, because you are looking to get employees back to office? Is that going to change for you?

The silver lining coming out of this pandemic is that mindset has changed significantly, both for our customers and our own people. So we will see a lot more talent to be leveraged across locations as long as we find the right talent, it doesn’t matter whether somebody is sitting in Pune, Hyderabad, London or New York. We can just integrate them into the pool. This change is going to create a significant customer value and also for the organisation because of the fungibility of talents that got created as a result of this.

The scale will go up significantly and many experts will work on multiple projects and projects across multiple locations at the same time. Their time will be premium and experts will work on multiple projects across locations as long as they have the right skills, and the customer gets the best value. The mindset of being physically there in the same room together for executing the project has gone away. Imagine the value it creates for organisations like us.

We have also seen a drop in attrition, especially geography-specific. Somebody in New York is working on an assignment, which is based out of Chicago, who otherwise would have quit. They would say, ‘I want a job in New York and I cannot move out of New York. If I don’t have the next assignment, I'll quit and join somewhere else.’ That is actually going away because we are able to find an assignment for him or her in another location… So it is a mindset change that has happened in the market, and that will create value for us in value for the customers.



There are a lot of women who have dropped out after working for a few years. What are you doing to kind of go after that segment?

We actually have started with an initiative called Rebegin. It is an initiative only for women who have taken career breaks and want to start up their careers. This is intentional hiring, which we are doing here specifically for this group of associates. We need to tap into this (talent pool) and it’s a win-win for everybody. We will actually have a lot of hungry associates wanting to come back to work and create differentiation at the same time. An organisation, obviously, will have to look for such people who are wanting to make a difference. Hence the birth of this Rebegin initiative in TCS and I expect to get significant results out of it. Till date we have got 4,807 applications for Rebegin.



The other question is about gig workers. There are many people again who would like to programme for TCS for maybe two days a week and then work on their side projects for the rest of the days. How are you tapping into this gig worker pool?

The most important part here is to identify those kinds of activities, which can be done independently. And then why not start the internal gig first in which people can do these kinds of assignments, in addition to their regular job outside of their job hours. This is the kind of thought process we're looking at right now. The way it will happen is a three step process. First try and do this for internal projects, then try to do it with internal gig workforce within and then go for external workforce.",1926,0.7949081318719047

For TCS employees, Tata group winning the Air India bid, is nostalgic given that it was the first airline most of them took for international travel, the software major's CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said. He added that it will contribute in any possible way it can to revive the airline to its past glory.

The Tata group won the Air India bid for Rs 18,000 crore on October 8. It is sort of like a homecoming moment for the salt-to-software conglomerate, which founded Air India, but gave control to the government 68 years ago.

TCS and Air India

Speaking to media persons on Friday after the company's Q2 FY22 results, Gopinathan said, ""Air India is the most nostalgic airline for most TCSers. Almost all of us took our first international trip on Air India. We used to go with the return ticket and that used to be our safety guard that if all else fails we just have to get to the Air India office somewhere and we will get back home.”

“We will try to do our best to contribute in whichever form we will try to revive it to the glory that it had, as one of the best airlines in the world. So we are looking forward to participating in all forms,” he said, during the earnings call on October 8.

This move could have significant implications for the software major, which accounts for about 90 percent of the group’s income and hence might have to do the heavy lifting. “Given the multiple headwinds post the energy crisis, falling metal prices, the China crisis which may impact Tata Motors, and rising input costs among others, the contribution from other companies in the group may dwindle. TCS will have to feed the group with growth capital – both organic and inorganic,” a Moneycontrol Pro article said.

However, it might not be all bad. On the other hand, this can result in higher payment for shareholders, the article said.

In response to Moneycontrol’s query about higher dividends for TCS shareholders, Gopinathan said, “As far as financials goes, dividends is the decision of the board and they will take the decision. I don’t think individual investments at the group level have ever been a factor for these decisions.”

But this does present a business opportunity. Gopinathan explained that with the aviation sector recovering, the environment looks optimistic and presents opportunities for growth, as the industry invests and leverages technologies.

“We have seen this kind of resilience in the customer segment over the last two years. Airlines have shown remarkable capability to ride through the crisis and in many cases, their expected return to normalcy has come forward by 12-18 months. Even six months back they were talking about a 24 months kind of time frame,” Gopinathan said.

The airlines, Gopinathan said, are using this opportunity to change customer experience, streamline operations and invest in technology that could deliver that experience. “TCS has been participating strongly in that space and it is a very encouraging sign of how a crisis can trigger change that can benefit for decades,” he added.

TCS does not declare revenue separately for its aviation business. But it is covered under the retail and consumer business, which accounts for about 15 percent of the company’s revenue.

In its FY21 annual report, the company said that its Travel, Transportation & Hospitality was badly impacted by pandemic restrictions. “Key investment themes include contactless operations and self-service, operating model changes, and simplification,” the company said.

Tata group and Air India

The only other competitor for the airline was SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh, who was the only other bidder in the fray. Singh bid in his personal capacity and his bid was around Rs 15,100 crore.

Ratan N Tata in a statement said, “While admittedly it will take considerable effort to rebuild Air India, it will hopefully provide a very strong market opportunity to the Tata Group’s presence in aviation.

“On an emotional note, Air India, under the leadership of JRD Tata had, at one time, gained the reputation of being one of the most prestigious airlines in the world. Tata will have the opportunity of regaining the image and reputation it enjoyed in earlier years. Mr JRD Tata would have been overjoyed if he was in our midst today.”

N Chandrasekaran, Chairman, Tata Sons, said, “At the Tata group, we are delighted to be declared as the winner of the bid for Air India. This is a historic moment, and it will be a rare privilege for our group to own and operate the company’s flag bearer airline.”",785,0.5003513097763062

India’s largest IT firm TCS is planning to get 80-85 percent of its employees back to its campuses as vaccination gains pace, said a top executive.

The company has over 70 percent of employees fully vaccinated and 95 percent who have received at least one dose.

TCS COO NG Subramaniam, said during the earnings call on October 8 that the company will encourage employees at senior level and those fully vaccinated to come to campuses. Some of the executives from the management and delivery side are already coming to work over the last few weeks.

The idea, he said, is to get the majority of the employees return to office. “From the current 95-98 percent working remotely, we want 80-85 percent of employees back to offices,” Subramaniam said.

According to him, this is key to implementing its 25 by 25 strategy, where the company will have only 25 percent of employees working in offices by 2025.

Subramaniam further said that most of its offices have been sanitized and all protocols have been put in place with desired level of flexibility required in operations.

After 1.5 years of remote working, IT companies are looking to get employees back to office as vaccination gains pace. Last month, Wipro started getting its senior leaders back to office twice a week starting September 13. UB Pravin Rao, COO, Infosys, said during the earnings call in July that it may see 20-30 percent of the workforce coming to office over the next six months, if the impact of the subsequent wave is minimal.

This will bring changes to the way companies will have to think about campuses. Development of campuses will be slower and the number of employees working will be less to take into account safety measures.

“Moving forward, taking into consideration employee safety and all the other things, we will at best have 50 percent of the workforce at any point in time. So our offices currently can operate only at 50-60 percent capacity at any point in time in terms of people coming into offices,” Subramaniam said in an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol.

While certain roles might be required to come to office frequently like those working on the infrastructure server, project managers can take a call on how often employees need to come to work based on customer needs.

“We left it to the units and the project manager whether you want to work two days a week, one week, a month, or let's say one month, and then the next two months you go offline, it's very different.

Tata Consultancy Services' share price edged higher in the morning trade on October 8 ahead of the country's largest IT services company's second- quarter result announcement.

Tata Consultancy Services is expected to report more than 5 percent sequential growth in revenue in constant currency terms and a 4.7 percent increase in dollar revenue in Q2FY22, with deal wins likely to be similar to Q1FY22, powered by mid-sized deals, experts say.

The growth in revenue is expected to be driven by conversion of earlier strong orders, recovery in Indian markets after a fall in the June quarter and strong spending on digital by corporates.

Catch all the market action on our live blog

""We expect strong constant currency revenue growth rate of 5.3 percent powered by strong spends on digital and short-cycle programmes, conversion of strong bookings of the earlier quarter into revenues, and recovery in India after a sharp contraction of 14.1 percent in the June 2021 quarter,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities. The brokerage expects a growth of 4.7 percent in international markets and 15 percent in India business.

Most experts say the deal wins in the quarter ended September 2021 are expected to be largely similar to the previous quarter.

""We expect $8 billion of total contract value (TCV) powered by mid-sized deals. We do not expect any skew in TCV from mega-deals. TCV of deals will decline on YoY comparison even as previous year number was skewed by Phoenix mega-deal of $2.5 billion,"" said Kotak.

Indian IT companies are not just enhancing tech and operational efficiencies of businesses globally but are also playing an important role in their transformation journeys, reflecting how the industry has steadily moved up the value chain, a top executive of Tata Consultancy Services said on Tuesday.

TCS Chairman (North America) Surya Kant said the technology sector has been the ""vanguard"" of industries, shaping trends in business, society and human behaviour.

""In the early days of the IT services industry, companies like TCS formed relationships with North American companies which were eager to become more efficient.

""They quickly took advantage of the expanding pool of highly skilled technology talent, but fast forward to today and the situation has changed dramatically,"" he said at the FICCI LEADS 2021 event.

He added that while these firms are still working closely with Indian IT firms to help improve their IT and business operations, the industry has been ""steadily moving up the value chain"".

""Today, these enterprises want and expect more partnering...in the growth and transformation journeys and the way it's been playing out is like a preview of how innovation will happen in the future,"" he said.

Kant said the IT services sector is a great example of the strong partnership that has been built between Indian and North American businesses.

He cited examples of efforts being made by the Mumbai-headquartered company in the US to engage with university students to make them industry-ready.

""The students receive invaluable insights into how to apply cutting-edge technology and TCS will nurture the next generation of North American technology talent,"" he said adding that ""it's only through partnerships, built on shared beliefs and local action that the seeds of innovation will foster growth"".

The top executive highlighted the company's efforts towards increasing local hiring and expanding STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education among students.

He said earlier this year, TCS had announced plans to expand its operations in Ohio by hiring more than 800 local employees at its outside of Cincinnati and other offices across the state by 2022.",353,0.9660487174987793

A public diatribe against two Indian business giants by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's officials and his ideological allies has unnerved the business community, several industry executives told Reuters.

Over the weekend, a magazine run by members of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) launched an attack on Indian tech giant Infosys for failing to resolve glitches in the income tax website it manages.

The group, which is the ideological parent of Modi's ruling party, called Infosys ""anti-national"" for letting down the tax system, sending a chill through Indian industry wary of falling on the wrong side of the Modi government.

Just last month, the finance ministry ""summoned"" Infosys' CEO over the tech issues and in an unusual step took to Twitter to announce the summoning, heightening a media frenzy around a company that has been the face of India's IT's prowess.

And in August, the commerce minister publicly lashed out at the $106 billion Tata Group for criticizing proposed stringent rules for e-commerce and said local companies should not only think about profits.

In India, safeguarding domestic businesses has been Modi's priority. While government or RSS criticism of foreign businesses like Amazon and Monsanto is common, local businesses are rarely caught in the crossfire.

But the latest events have raised concerns among business leaders about whether Modi is now taking a hardline approach towards domestic giants as well, five industry sources said.

One venture-capital executive said the criticism was akin to ""harassment"" of businesses and risks souring investor sentiment. Another executive working at a global consultancy said ""everyone is scared"" as businesses don't want to run foul of the government.

""The frontal attack on iconic elements of Indian businesses have only buttressed the need for companies to ensure they are conforming, not just with tax issues, but with other government initiatives,"" said Dilip Cherian, an image guru and co-founder of leading Indian PR firm Perfect Relations.

R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki, defended Infosys, saying it had played a key role in building India's software reputation globally.

""It needs to explain the glitches, but it doesn't mean there is a conspiracy to damage the country,"" he told Reuters.

A senior member of RSS, however, said there's nothing wrong in the way the companies have been criticized, saying they must be thick skinned and held accountable.

""Why should questions not be raised, have corporates become a holy cow?"" said the RSS official who declined to be identified.

Infosys and Tata didn't respond to a request for comment.

INDIA INC LARGELY SILENT

So far, Modi's government has not commented on the backlash on social media and from politicians. None of the sources who spoke to Reuters wanted to be identified as they fear a reprisal from the government and no Indian industry lobby groups has come out and spoken against government or RSS.

The Indian Express said in an editorial it was ""time for India Inc to stand up"", saying business leaders had maintained ""a studied - and perhaps strategic - silence about the vitriol that has been seeping into the public discourse.""

The Infosys controversy is related to the government's new income tax filing website launched on June 7. But there were many glitches which Infosys could not fix, despite assurances.

When the Infosys CEO was summoned in August, the finance minister conveyed ""deep disappointment and concerns,"" giving the company until Sept. 15 to fix things.

The magazine Panchjanya said the company was making the same mistakes over and over again, creating doubts about its motives. ""There are allegations that the management of Infosys is deliberately trying to destabilize the Indian economy,"" it said.

After the furore over the article, Sunil Ambekar, the joint head of the RSS publicity wing, sought to distance the organisation from the contents and said Infosys had made a seminal contribution to the country.

But concerns remain others may be targeted, too.

A mutual fund manager with Infosys and Tata investments said he was worried as it indicated ""the government was not pro-business"", and there were fears other companies can face such backlash for lapses.",692,-0.9297711849212646

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) was ranked 20th, while Reliance Industries held the 9th slot in the 2021 Future Brand Index report which said the corporate giants, the only Indian companies in the top-100, were scripting an exciting, new story about India’s business prowess.

In a changed environment because of the pandemic, TCS climbed 45 notches from last year to the 20th rank, while Reliance Industries retained its position in the global top-10 after slipping seven spots to the ninth position, according to the report issued by the global consultancy on September 1.

“The pandemic effect has disproportionately affected consumer-facing brands, with many of 2020’s Top Ten displaced by B2B giants,” the release states. In 2020, Reliance entered the top 10 list for the very first time, just behind Apple, at the second position.

“Together, these (Indian) giants are beginning to carve out a new and exciting story about the business prowess and potential of India – a country that will soon overtake China to become the most populous in the world,” the report states.

The FutureBrand Index reorders PwC’s list of Global Top 100 Companies by Market Cap on perception strength, rather than financial strength, covering a global sample of over 3,000 informed professionals, being aware of and knowing something about at least seven of the top 100 companies of that year.

This year’s survey was conducted from April 27 to May 12, 2021, evaluating responses based on 18 indicators that provide the most relevant signals of success including purpose and experience, which determine the rankings.

ASML Holdings, the company on which global chipmakers rely upon, ranks at the top among the 100 companies in the list. The company set a strong perception performance on attributes like innovation, indispensability, and the quality of its people amid being “at the centre of the global chip shortage which has threatened to disrupt life as we know it – impacting everything from cars to consumer technology,” the report notes.

This change at the top shifted tech behemoth Apple to the second position, followed by Prosus NV, Danaher Corp and NextEra Energy. Tech and Healthcare companies have stood out this year on FutureBrand Index pointing out “heightened need for connectivity and a focus on improving quality of life after what has been a hugely challenging year for the world.”

B2B entities which were lower down the table on the previous Indexes, have jumped up with tech and pharma brands becoming ‘household’ names. This is enabled by a shift in society’s focus on innovation to help come out of the pandemic.

TCS top riser among tech brands

Saudi Aramco emerged as the top riser, moving up 63 places to 28th position, above TCS--in terms of moving up places, followed by LVMH (up 37 places at 29), Berkshire Hathaway (up 33 places at 50), China Mobile (up 27 places at 45). TCS was also the top riser among the technology brands.

The Indian IT colossus performed well on both purpose and experience indicators with scores “increasing significantly” over the last one year. “As a result, nearly half of our respondents stated that they would like to work for the company and buy its products, coming in at 46 percent and 44 percent respectively,” the report points out.

This year, the financial sector has shown the highest performance score since the FutureBrand Index launch in 2014, this attributed to the greater need to depend and trust financial institutions amid business struggling with reduced incomes and job losses. Likewise, the consumer staples sector has benefitted from recurring lockdowns, the report notes.

“This year’s research has revealed a huge shift in the way companies work and how they convey their mission to their consumers,” Jon Tipple, Global Chief Strategy Officer at FutureBrand said. “Those that look set to thrive in a post-pandemic world, are companies prioritising innovation to consistently impact individual well-being and drive change for good at scale.”

For S Sundararajan, a practising Chartered Accountant in Tamil Nadu, it has been a frustrating few weeks. Tax season is in full swing but the new I-T portal has not been working, to put it mildly.

“One Time Passwords weren’t being delivered consistently. If it does, the portal itself does not open. When everything seems to be working, you are unable to complete e-verification,” says the Chartered Accountant, who is batting calls from customers wanting to know when their returns will be filed.

“I have no answer to that,” says Sundararajan.

This is the answer taxpayers and professionals across the country have been seeking from IT major Infosys, which designed the new I-T e-filing portal that has run into glitches right from the time it was launched on June 7, 2021.

Infosys’ new IT portal

Infosys was awarded the contract in 2019 to develop the new I-T portal, replacing the old one, in a bid to reduce the processing time from 63 days to one day for a total outlay of Rs 4200 crore. The idea was to have a taxpayer-friendly portal that was simple in design and use, and expedite refunds, which has become a running joke now with the portal inaccessible more often than not.

The portal was launched on June 7, amid the peak tax season and things started going downhill right then.

A few hours after the launch, tax professionals took to Twitter and said that the portal had run into glitches tagging Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. A day after the launch on June 8, Sitharaman asked Infosys co-founder and chairman Nandan Nilekani to address users' concerns.

As the issues persisted, Infosys was summoned by the Finance Ministry on June 22. During the meeting, which was attended by CEO Salil Parekh virtually and COO Pravin Rao in person, the company assured that it has augmented the team to address the glitches and the team is working to resolve them.

Two months later, on August 23 the team met the Finance Minister again and was given the ultimatum of September 15 to resolve the issues. While the company has assured that it is working on this expeditiously and has as many as 750 people working on the project with COO Rao overseeing it, there is not much clarity on what went wrong with the portal.

Moneycontrol spoke to executives, tax professionals and industry experts to understand what went wrong. Most of them spoke on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the project and also because they are not official spokespersons on the issue.

What really went wrong with the I-T portal?

A lot of things, as multiple sources pointed out.

For one, the scope of the project at such a massive scale was not well defined. ""They (government) did not define the scope properly and launched it in a rush,” said one of the sources familiar with the development.

While the company had asked the goalposts to be shifted to a later date, that did not happen, said another industry source, who has worked with the company on international projects. This meant that the system was far from ready.

The second issue was that the portal wasn’t complete at the time of launch. There were several aspects missing in the portal and as an executive pointed out, the portal was half-baked. A technology expert, who has experience working in government tech projects, explained that there are multiple layers in the portal that have to work cohesively for the seamless transaction on the site. This has not happened.

Sundararajan, the chartered accountant cited earlier, concurs. “What used to take a couple of hours, now it's much longer. Some of my clients are not getting One Time Passwords at all and for others, it takes a few days to complete the whole process,” he says.

In one case, he had to fill the application online and send it to the I-T office in Bengaluru for verification since the online system just was not working. “Forget about getting processes complete in a day from 63 days. The portal only is not functioning most of the time,” he says.

There is more. Not many functionalities, he pointed out, were working. “The old system had Express Pan, which lets us generate pan card numbers quickly for processing the I-T returns since the whole process takes two months. That functionality is not working now,” Sundararajan says.

Not all error messages displayed had clarity and many of the forms required by the professionals to complete the process were unavailable. “There is no grievance mechanism or forum to put up my query or help desk where I can take up the concern too,” says Sundararajan.

Sundararajan and other experts have pointed out that the lack of clarity around where the issue is presents a challenge. “We don't know if the issue is on the server side, the application or the process itself,” experts added.

The technology expert quoted earlier said, “You experience two things in software parlance. One is either your server will crash or your system will crash. Server crashes are because of load and system/application crashes when the software coding which was done to withstand the traffic does not work.” There is a third aspect, which is the integration of multiple utilities that makes the whole process easier.

Consider this. For individuals, he/she needs to log into the portal and fill in I-T returns form, verify using OTP and then submit it. Once the process is complete, the user might want to go back and download previous ITRs for his foreign travel or to get a loan. Another person might not have linked Aadhaar with his pan card and would need to access that facility in the portal.

Each of these is a separate block that has to work together when the user requests it. But currently it is not consistent making the whole process daunting. It does not help that the entire architecture has been built from scratch.

“So somewhere, I would call it an overwhelming situation where it is a combination of numbers, it's a combination of traffic, it's a combination of new architecture, and it is also a combination of the fact that much of this is custom built,” the expert said.

This brings us to the third issue, lack of testing. According to multiple sources, the portal was launched prematurely before testing. “The user acceptance test was not done by the I-T department. Usually only after (user acceptance) sign off portal is released,” said the third executive.

An email has been sent to Infosys and the Central Board of Direct Taxes on the same. The copy will be updated with their response.

Working on government projects

For many, this is also reminiscent of the company’s work on MCA21 (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) and the GSTN (Ministry of Finance) projects. However, it isn’t just Infosys that has trouble with government projects.

Wipro has had its fair share of troubles with projects such as the Employee State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) project. TCS, which runs India's passport project, the Indian Railways’ IRCTC site, and India Post’s digital project, is an outlier and has had relatively better success here. Even in the case of the I-T portal, the old system was maintained by TCS before for a decade before it was replaced by the current portal.

However, working with the government is far from easy and when you are building a system from scratch, such glitches aren't uncommon, especially given the scale and complexity of the project. The pandemic and the resulting work from home, no clear accountability from bureaucrats added to the challenge.

To Infosys’ credit, one of the executives quoted above, said that the company has answered 70,000 out of 75,000 queries. Multiple executives have also pointed out that the Finance Minister’s tweet about summoning Infosys was uncalled for and has not gone down well with the company executives.

However as the situation prolongs, tax professionals are now asking for the old system to be brought back.

Bring back the old system

Vinay CS, a Bengaluru-based Chartered Accountant, said that between April and November are peak tax seasons and bringing a new system in the middle has not helped.

While old systems need to be replaced, Vinay pointed out that it should have been carried out a lot more carefully even if that means running the old and new systems in parallel.

Now a large section of professionals are batting for bringing the old system, which was maintained by TCS earlier. But it is easier said than done, say experts, and could bring more harm than good.

Why? Take for instance the experience of the Raghav* (name changed). Close to 10 years back, the income tax department issued a notice to him stating that he had Rs 1,600 in tax unpaid, despite him having paid it. “Why did this happen?” he asked.

“Because when the migration happened from the manual system to the online system then, they missed porting some of the data sets of the old database into the new one. So one day, physically, I had to go and sit with the income tax department officials and tell them how to port it,” he explained.

Similar issues could arise when moving back to the old system now. Most of the data from the old portal has already been migrated to the new one and many have already started filing them. If we were to reverse the old portal, user information could go missing resulting in mismatch and could create an even bigger mess, experts added.

Leadership transition

Moneycontrol recently reported that Infosys' India business head Raghupathi N Cavale, who was set to retire in September, is likely to get an extension as his exit could hamper its attempt to turn around the crucial Income Tax portal project.

He was supposed to be replaced by Karthikeyan Neelakandan, Vice-President, who was given charge of the India business in April 2021, making way for a transition this September. But those plans may change now, as the company faces blowback for the series of glitches in the newly unveiled I-T portal, sources said.

Cavale had taken a backseat in running India operations a few months ago but was pressed into action in the last few weeks as he has deep expertise in handling government projects and dealing with bureaucrats. COO Rao, who is now overseeing the project, will also be retiring this year end, which could also pose a challenge as the company looks to address the concerns.

“Infosys has built a strong system that can scale. But it is a large and complex system and stability will be an issue,” one of the sources said.",1804,-0.6905900518099467

Tata Sons CFO Saurabh Agarwal’s salary will rise 35 percent to Rs 21.45 crore, making him the highest-paid in the group after Executive Chairman N Chandrasekaran, the holding company of the conglomerate said in its annual report.

The company is seeking shareholders’ approval to reappoint Agarwal, Ralph Speth and independent director Harish Manwani on its board at their 103rd annual general meeting on September 14.

The AGM will also consider plans to issue Non-Convertible debentures on a private placement basis. It did not disclose the amount in the annual report but it has separately written to shareholders it planned to raise Rs 40,000 crore. It did not say the purpose of raising this amount.

Agarwal’s current remuneration is Rs 15.85 crore after having taken a minor salary cut. The report did not mention any change in salary for Chandrasekaran, whose remuneration was Rs 58 crore after an 11 percent cut.

Other top-paid Tata executives are TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan at Rs 20.36 crore and Tata Steel MD TV Narendran whose remuneration is up 38% at Rs 15.58. Tata Steel CFO Koushik Chatterjee is also in the coveted above-Rs 10 crore salary bracket. His salary was raised over 20 percent this year. Puneet Chhatwal who heads the Indian Hotels Company Ltd, took a pay cut as the pandemic hit business.

The market capitalisation of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Wednesday breached the Rs 13.5 lakh crore mark -- the second company after Reliance Industries Ltd to achieve the feat.

At close of trade, the market valuation of TCS stood at Rs 13,53,667.85 crore on BSE.

The company had touched the Rs 13 lakh crore valuation level on August 17, when its market capitalisation (m-cap) stood at Rs 13,14,051.01 crore.

On BSE, the scrip on Wednesday opened at Rs 3,612.8 and zoomed nearly 2.35 per cent to its 52-week high value of Rs 3,697.

It finally ended at Rs 3,659.5, up 1.31 per cent over the previous close. It was also the biggest gainer in the Sensex 30 pack on Wednesday.

In terms of volume, 70,000 scrips were traded on BSE during the day.

Similarly on NSE, the scrip opened a positive note at Rs 3,610 and climbed to its 52-week high of Rs 3,697.75. It finished at Rs 3,665, 1.43 per cent above the previous close.

A total of over 21.23 lakh shares changed hands on NSE during the session.

TCS is the second most valuable domestic firm after Reliance Industries Ltd, whose m-cap stood at Rs 13,96,135.56 crore.

On Tuesday, Infosys had become the fourth Indian company to touch a market valuation of USD 100 billion (Rs 7.4 lakh crore), after TCS, Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank.

With this, two out of the four companies to have crossed the USD 100 billion mark are IT firms.

In the ranking of top 10 domestic companies by m-cap, Reliance Industries is at the number one spot, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, Infosys, Hindustan Unilever, HDFC, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, State Bank of India and Wipro.

The silence is striking when you enter the TCS campus at Whitefield in Bengaluru. The security checks take less than a minute, the food courts are empty and there is no rush for the elevator. A building that can typically accommodate 3000-5000 people currently has around 50 people as a majority of employees continue to work from home post the Covid-19 pandemic.

TCS, which is India's largest software firm and one of the biggest employers, wants to move to a hybrid model where only 25 percent of its employees need to spend time at the office by 2025.

Its Chief Operating Officer N Ganapathy Subramaniam is sure to be in the 25 percent, as he believes being in the office is important to get key tasks done and also a place where you have undivided attention.

NGS, who joined TCS in 1982, held many leadership positions before becoming COO in February 2017. In a freewheeling interview with Moneycontrol, he spoke about the business momentum, its bets on Electric Vehicles & the Tata super app, why the company is not worried about the war for talent and the future of work.

Edited Excerpts:

The first quarter obviously started off with good momentum. But India business was the Achilles heel. Now we are in the middle of the second quarter. Are you seeing a rebound in India business and overall momentum?

I can't say that it has improved fully. We are seeing some progress but given that the people are a bit cautious about the third wave coming in, I can't claim that it is fully recovered from India business perspective. Services like Passport Seva Kendra depend on people coming and taking passports. In TCS iON, we need to conduct the exams. Based on the examination and results published is how we get paid. Some of these things are getting delayed, and slowly picking up. But hopefully another month (for recovery), but I don't think that we are fully back yet.

In terms of overall business, the momentum is positive. I think the US, Europe, and UK, new business and the investments that they are planning, all of that is looking alright.

When the pandemic struck, these companies had no choice but to go digital. But now with countries opening up, do you continue to see momentum for large digitisation initiatives? Are you still seeing those transformative large deals in the marketplace and if so in which sectors?

Digitisation work is progressing and the way that clients are started to invest, it is happening in multiple waves. First wave was to ensure there was resilience in digitisation so that they can continue to serve their customers online, real time. The next wave was continuing that momentum to see if we can extend the capabilities and be present in every market or every marketplace in which the customers go out and transact. If you take manufacturing, as a case in point, almost all auto vendors are looking at selling more cars. More than the autonomous vehicle and connected vehicles paradigm, I think things have moved to electric vehicles, where enormous amounts of investments are happening. Demand for electric vehicles across the globe is something that is quite well known today and this also most of the auto manufacturers have also have a sustainability agenda and moving into electric vehicles is an important shift in that direction for them right. On other types of manufacturing, be it chemicals or pharmaceuticals, people are looking at alternative supply chains, and how do I choose to develop multiple paths to getting the equipment so that they don’t get into situations where they are not able to commit to deliveries. Every manufacturing company is investing in digitisation to rework the supply chains, and build the new vendors, ecosystems, and all the corresponding changes that are required in terms of technology and operations.

With electric vehicles as a segment seeing significant investments, how will TCS tap into this opportunity? Can you share more on the kind of work you are doing in this space?

Tata Motors is doing well and we are also partnering with them on this front. Jaguar Land Rover is another customer with whom we are working as well. Whichever customers we are working with, be it Fiat Chrysler or Stellantis, a company formed by merger between Chrysler and French PSA Group, and many other customers, we are working with them on this. But are we the number one partner in each one of them?

I can't say that we are the number one partner for everybody, because there are multiple approaches that they have. One is to develop themselves, with partners like us. The other is to develop OEMs, in which case, then we'll have to go after and work with OEMs. So in either of these cases, I think we are well positioned. We think that particular piece of business is growing nicely for us.

Could you share more in terms of the value add you are making? Because a lot of these companies say they are not an auto company but a technology firm. From that perspective where does your role come in?

They are a technology company, alright, but they need technicians to help as well. They do some pieces and outsource some. It could be the next generation infotainment system, leveraging the connected ecosystem and how is it going to be done? Can everything be moved on to the cloud? What is the security element that goes into it? There is an enormous amount of work that is involved in product engineering, as well as software design and testing.

Could you quantify the potential market or business opportunity?

Given that it is the focus area for most car manufacturers, it is a fairly significant market. Electric vehicles on the passenger car side have been sorted out, mostly I think it's there including battery systems and battery life. The same thing has to be done at a much higher scale for the trucks. A lot of research and development work is going on. A lot of prototypes are getting developed. Electric vehicles, while initially started off with two wheelers, and then the four wheelers on the passenger car side, I think that huge opportunity will come when it is also into the truck side. The way I see it is not going to be only for passenger cars, it has to go into the truck side eventually. In that sense our work is in terms of working with a lot of players to integrate and partner with them and also do our own research in terms of what kind of software that is required. Can we develop patrons for some of this because it's getting software based and how do we leverage it in some way? The standards are still evolving.

At least in the next 5-10 year term, this will be a lot of work that will be evolving based on electric vehicles, connected cars, and connected vehicles. And then the business model itself is changing. People are used to buying cars. Now I think it is - use the car and leave it whenever you want to go – subscription based model that's coming. In such cases, what is the kind of infrastructure one needs to build, what is the role of distributors, are some of the things that need to be looked at. So I think the space is getting interesting, and it's going to take a lot of change, it's going to go through a lot of change.

You work with group companies like Tata Motors. What is the role you will be playing in Tata Digital, which has acquired Big Basket and 1MG recently and has plans for a super app?

There's a team working with Tata Steel, a team is working with Jaguar Land Rover, Tata Motors, and there are other group companies. But this is done on merit and we have to earn it. There is a strong, cohesive team that's consciously going and pitching for work, like we do for any other customers. Then they go through a competitive process, and then we win. So I think we are working for a large number of Tata Group companies.

How much of the opportunity do you see within Tata Digital, which is a key focus for the Tata Group?

I won't be able to quantify all of this, because, like any other firm, they will have a multi-vendor strategy. And all I can say is we are strong partners. In fact, originally, we are part and parcel of the entire super app development. We are also working very closely with a number of other initiatives. Even in terms of all the mergers that were happening within the group, a lot of these things are, this is very much part of it (the work we are doing with Tata Digital). For example, Big Basket and 1MG have come in and we need to bring them together.

How do you see the opportunity in telecom with 5G coming up and Tata group's recent investment in Tejas. Do you see the investment giving you a boost as far as the telecom vertical is concerned?

I think that the group has always entered into businesses, when they felt that India needs (it) like Tata Steel, Tata Motors, which were all born like that. What I understand is that the group also chose to get into this telecom space. Primarily because the country needs it, and then the government pushes in terms of the number and the opportunity to work with Indian telcos like Airtel and BSNL. It's a huge opportunity. So TCS will be a system integrator.

Companies may have the equipment from Tejas or others, but have to be integrated and put into place. There are other group companies that are also capable of doing that, for example, Tata Communications. So for the purpose of rolling it out into Airtel, BSNL, 4G or 5G kind of equipment, like we do internationally, we can implement, integrate, monitor it or optimise it. We will be looking forward to participating in some of these projects.

How are you managing the supply side issue? Is a lot of this happening because of the growth in IT coming back in a big way? Or is it also because of the startup boom?

I would agree that there is a great demand for talent, but supply is not constrained in India. Here it is free and available and most IT companies took it upon themselves to train people and essentially hold ourselves accountable for the skills that we all need. Two years ago, we just took it upon ourselves and said that look, we are not going to go and acquire people, we are going to go and train our people ground up. If you look at the employee pyramid, we continue to add fresh talent from the universities at the bottom. And then we keep promoting people based on their competencies. We had about 40,000-45,000 people join us last year, both freshers and laterals.

Does this mean that attrition is not as much of an issue for TCS like for other companies? How do you manage them?

We have good supply in the middle, which is where the demand is. But this is not to say that the employees are not getting lured. They are getting a lot of opportunities. Retaining them is about giving them good work, which is first. Second is, how do you make sure that they work with good people and also the environment, and also challenge in the workplace. Third thing is, giving them reasonable money and competition. It (retention) is a combination of all the three. We are not a fly-by-night operator. People recognise that so we are able to retain a reasonable number of people.

What we are seeing in the market is probably an anomaly and will be corrected in due course. But do you see that impacting pricing? Are you able to command more pricing from customers, and how is the business model changing?

We are conscious that the demand environment is good and talent is going to be important. We have consciously trained and invested in people. But if the market is going to offer a 100 percent increase, naturally, people will get lured. So it's a choice, people leave and you cannot restrict them. So how does our business model change? ‘There's a strong demand and it is a sellers’ environment, so I would increase the price.’ That's not the way it works. There are industries which are still constrained. You go and ask an airline and say ‘Look, we want to do this project but it is going to cost you 20 percent or 30 percent more, because I'm paying my employees more.’ Pricing is a function of different things. Business models will change, and the way we charge people will change. People don't want to spend on capex today (capital expenditure), they want to spend only on op-ex (operational expenditure). So where is the question of me charging on a time and material basis, say by 10 percent etc.. There are multiple models. There are people who want resources and in those cases you may be able to charge them a premium for the right skills. But a majority of the large customers where we want to have a long term partnership, they don't want to be transactional like this. That is not the way this business works, at least our business. The way that we have built our relationship is that pricing is a function of value delivered. I don't want to say I would increase the price every opportune time. That's not the way that we are. To answer your question, am I going to see a pricing increase? Potentially, yes. But it is a function of the type of customers, projects and a number of other factors.

Could you share more on how fresher strategy is playing out? TCS offers higher salaries for those with digital skills. Can you elaborate?

There will be some increases here and there. But 18 months ago, we said that these are the additional training programs in digital available to you. You have an offer in TCS, but if you invest your time, get yourself qualified for these skills, you will double your salary. So consciously we are encouraging people to become digitally capable in skills like full stack developers and ready for the future.



I don’t think there is a pressure on salary. Ultimately, the market is large. If I want to hire 40,000 people in India via the National Qualifier Test (NQT), we have 200,000 people registered. Why did we go for NQT? It is not that we just go and hire people based on their CV. Everything is digitised and we know exactly this person took this much time to answer this question. This module one performed well and this module he didn't perform well. So we could actually paint a picture of your quotient map for all people who took our tests. Through this database, we know what modules people performed well and those they have not and suggest training programs available for them. So I think that the demand-supply situation is still good. It's not alarming. I think at the entry-level, we will have absolutely no problem in hiring the talent that we need.

TCS’ attrition is one of the lowest at 8.6 percent. We have learnt that the company has sort of an unwritten rule, where you don’t hire former TCS employees…

It is not an unwritten rule. It is a very clear policy. The policy is that you (former employee) want to join (back); there are so many people who want to join. So it's going to take quite some time for you to get in because the queue is so long back.

The other thing I want to ask is the challenge of managing 5 lakh people. Do you see TCS becoming an organisation with for example, 1 million people? And you know, so what is the challenge of managing such a huge organisation and still manage to be agile?

We might become 1 million people. People asked the same question when we were 100,000 and asked will you become 200,000. Our organisation model evolved two-three years ago. We said time had come and we needed to create sub-units. We created 150 sub-units from 30 earlier. These 150 units run as their own company with a fully empowered structure and fully empowered organisation. They go out there, they execute it, sell it and they manage the customers. We provide governance and oversight. I review all those units once a quarter not in terms of business performance, but how well they are feeling empowered, which is based on their performance. This process is scalable.

For engineers and potential employees who are reading this interview, if you have to give them three tips on how they can make it to TCS, what would you tell them in terms of skills?

First is that if you have the passion, we have the time right. Second is that if you want to dream of making a career, this is the place because there are enough examples here. Third is if you want to find a career somewhere else, you won't find a better launch pad than TCS.



I felt that I could organise myself better when I was working in the office. I still believe so. Working from home offers certain flexibility, there is no doubt about it. But you have to be in the office to get some of those important things done. When you want to have undivided attention and you have few people to touch base quickly and bounce it off, I think the office is the place. In my opinion returning to the office is very important.

But you're still standing by the 25 by 25 strategy, where you will have only 25 percent of the employees working in office by 2025?

Yes, I think you know, 25 by 25 is the foundation on which the world is talking about hybrid models. When people talk about hybrids, that's exactly what they mean.

But do you still feel the need for such a big campus? So will you cut down on fresh investments or perhaps optimise current campuses?

With the pace at which we will develop some of those will probably be slower. For example, if we take this building. It could have 3000 people working in this building. But when moving forward, taking into consideration employee safety and all the other things, we will at best have 50 percent of the workforce at any point in time. So our offices currently can operate only at 50-60 percent capacity at any point in time in terms of people coming into offices. If you take what are the roles that will remain an office, they are security guards, and canteen contractors. We can't ask them to work from home. Likewise, even in our technology skills, infrastructure server, somebody has to reboot the server, and monitor them. But finally what customers want is the type of work that we do. So we left it to the units and the project manager whether you want to work two days a week, one week, a month, or let's say one month, and then the next two months you go offline, it's very different. That's up to you to see how you want to manage this. Plus, there are always situations like separate client visits. There are some important presentations that you have to make or deliver and demonstrate it to the customer. Then I can call these people on those days. So there is a certain amount of plasticity and flexibility but on average we believe that the 25 by 25 model will pan out and I'm not in a hurry to roll up a private notice even when we announce it.",3353,0.5529512763023376

Process, program management and architecture- three seemingly mundane things, helped TCS, India's largest software firm, crack the one code that its rivals have struggled with- executing massive projects for the Indian government.

In an interview with Moneycontrol, the IT firm's COO N Ganapathy Subramaniam said large, mission-critical government projects continue to be a strong area of focus. Some of the critical e-governance projects that TCS runs include Passport Seva Kendra, India Post and IRCTC.

""Government projects not just in India but around the world are different. They are highly process-centric and there will also be a lot of exacting demands from them in terms of performance guarantees, liabilities,"" he said.

As Moneycontrol reported recently, a combination of factors - undefined scope, inflexible milestones, delay in payment, and lack of ownership from the government on these projects, are some of the reasons why companies struggle to execute these, vis-a-vis projects that they execute with apparent ease for Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 companies.

""The key thing is when you do a project for the government, you have got to be very solid in program management. Second is that you need to get the architecture right. Because there will be changes which keep on coming. You need to get the architecture right to make all these changes,"" he said.

Subramaniam added that the other thing to be careful about are payment terms in these contracts.

""Sometimes, they will say you need to roll out 173 locations. They will stop after 170 and give the next three after a few years. If there is a clause that you will not get paid unless you complete 173, you are stuck. So you have to be careful about agreeing to some of these payment terms and conditions,"" he said.

​""You ultimately have to work with them. And some of the projects, take passports for example, citizens are involved. So you have to be on top of it."" he said.

While TCS' experience has been better in dealing with the government, it hasn't been the case for its rival Infosys, which now runs critical projects such as the GST and the Income Tax portal.

Its top management was summoned by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman this week, where she conveyed her ""deep disappointment"" about the continuing glitches in the new income tax portal. The company now has time till September 15 to fix this.

Infosys won the project in 2019 through a bidding process. The Income Tax portal was previously run by TCS.

To be sure, this is not the first time Infosys has been pulled up for a government project and neither is it the only company that has faced an issue.

While Infosys faced similar problems when it was working on the MCA21 (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) and the GSTN (Ministry of Finance) projects for the government, Wipro has had its fair share of troubles with projects such as Employee State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) and the National Registry of Citizens (NRC) project. ​",503,-0.021487221121788025

Talent may be the biggest challenge for many technology companies in the current red-hot job market but not so for TCS, one of India's largest job providers. According to its COO N Ganapathy Subramaniam, the company’s move to train people from the ground up and promote them based on competencies instead of hiring expensive people is paying off, at a time when its rivals are struggling to retain talent.

With five lakh employees, TCS is one of the largest recruiters in the country. It hired 40,000 freshers in FY21 and is likely to hire in similar numbers this year. In addition, the company's attrition rate continues to be one of the lowest at 8.6 percent for the quarter ending June 2021.

In an interview with Moneycontrol, Subramaniam said, “I would agree that there is a great demand for talent. But talent supply is not constrained in India. It's free, it's available and most IT companies, took it upon ourselves to train people and essentially hold ourselves accountable for the skills that we all need.""​

“Two years ago, we just took it upon ourselves and said that we are not going to go and acquire people. We are going to train our people ground up, upskill because there are no legacy people but only legacy technologies,” explains Subramaniam.

The company has been hiring 40,000 freshers over the last two years and is set to hire similar or more numbers this year as well from campuses. There are a couple of things TCS focuses on to ensure that they not only have the talent trained but also the ability to find the talent on-demand.

TCS’ National Qualifier Test (NQT) comes into the picture here. Close to 2 lakh people had registered for the test and the company had selected only 40,000. The company can select more people when needed from the pool of talents it has access to.

“Why did we go for NQT? It is not that we just go and hire people based on their CV. Everything is digitised and we exactly know this person took this much time to answer this question. This module one performed well and this module he didn't perform well. So we could actually paint a picture of your quotient map for all people who took our tests,” explained Subramaniam.

Through this database, the company can gauge modules people performed well and those they have not and suggest training programs available for them. “I think that the demand-supply situation is still good. It's not alarming. I think at the entry-level, we will have absolutely no problem in hiring the talent that we need,” he added.

To ensure that employees are skilled in new-age technologies, it has introduced ‘T Factor’ criteria to encourage employees to be broad and deep in certain areas of their domain and also technology. All these steps help the company keep employees relevant and skilled.

“If you really look at it, in an employee pyramid, we continued to add fresh talent from the universities at the bottom. Then we keep promoting people based on their competencies, and then some middle-level skills, I think we have enough in the middle level and we had all the people close to about 40,000-45,000 people join this, you know, both at entry-level and lateral.”

He further explained that this would give the company supply in the middle level, which is where the demand is and companies are going after. TCS’ employees too are not an exception, and according to Subramaniam, the employees are getting a lot of opportunities and are getting lured.

“Retaining them is about giving them good work, which is first. Second is, how do you make sure that they work with good people and also the environment. Third thing is, giving them reasonable money. It (retention) is a combination of all the three. We are not a fly-by-night operator. People recognise that so we are able to retain a reasonable number of people,” he added.

The company’s focus continues to be investing in people, training them, and giving them an environment in which employees, their peers, and colleagues are challenged all the time, with a competitive salary, he added.

Seven IT stocks hit 52-week highs on the same day – HCL Technologies, Larsen & Toubro Infotech, L&T Technology Services, MindTree, Tata Consultancy Services, Mphasis and Tech Mahindra.

On a year-to-date basis, as many as 14 stocks, mostly from the midcap IT segment, registered gains ranging from 100 percent to 400 percent – among them, MindTree, Persistent Systems, Mastek, Tata Elxsi, Nelco, Happiest Minds, Brightcom Group and Majesco.

What’s powering the rally and will it continue? The momentum in the IT index comes from the June quarter results, the pipeline of confirmed deals and sustainable margins, which are positive for IT companies.

“IT stocks have been witnessing strong traction on the back of a shift to digital and cloud technology because of the Covid situation, which led companies to adopt the work-from-home culture,” said Ajit Mishra, VP – research, Religare Broking Ltd. “Further, IT companies’ order books grew healthily as there is a noticeable increase in technology spending and demand also continues to rise in the global as well as domestic markets.”

Mishra said cost control, better-than-expected earnings and an optimistic outlook by managements have boosted investor confidence.

“Digitalisation technology, new orders, cost control and management support will continue to drive growth for the sector,” he added.

Tier-2 IT companies grew at almost double the rate of tier-1 companies on an organic basis.

“In the quarter, tier-I companies grew 5.2 percent QoQ (3 percent on organic basis) and tier-II companies grew 8.2 percent QoQ (6 percent on organic basis). Wipro and Coforge reported robust numbers, up 12.2 percent and 15.8 percent, respectively, led by acquisitions,” ICICIDirect said in a report.

The acceleration in the order books and the deal pipeline for tier-1 and tier-2 companies continues to be strong, led by an increase in deal sizes and higher spending by enterprises on cloud migration and digital technology.

In the current quarter, growth is being led by banking, financial services and insurance, retail, hi-tech, communication and healthcare. Even verticals that were laggards like travel and energy & utilities are seeing healthy traction, according to the report.

IT companies are witnessing improved traction in digital technology, which is a key driver of their revenue growth.

“We believe we are in the first phase of a multi-year technology transformation phase driven by digital technologies. In the current phase, enterprises are building a cloud-based foundation that will serve as a resilient, secure, scalable digital core,” the report added.

Phani Medicharla works as a senior manager in a technology leadership role at Tata Consultancy Services in Stockholm. Looking back at his previous experiences in Asia-Pacific, North America and Europe, he recalls having benefited most from working with managers who gave him “the freedom to explore and experiment on the job”.

As he took risks and made tough decisions, they watched from a distance and offered gentle, timely nudges. With the aim of paying it forward, Medicharla decided to compile his learnings in the form of a book titled The Conscientious Manager: Nurturing Workplace Ethics and Synergies. It was published in June 2021 by SAGE India.

Excerpts from an interview:

Why do you consider being conscientious an essential quality for managers?

A manager’s role comes with a great degree of ‘entrustment’ of time, assets, and expectations of outcomes. Managers need to safeguard this by being transparent, integral, and fully committed – essentially, conscientious. This helps to cultivate success and scale it. Conscientiousness helps managers accept current realities and not get stuck with yesteryear perceptions. I also believe that conscientious managers sleep better.

How can managers strike a balance between optimizing productivity and cultivating relationships with team members during the Covid-19 pandemic?

These shouldn’t be seen as separate objectives. Having a good relationship with the team has a positive influence on productivity. Among other things, productivity is the outcome of making several fine adjustments and openly sharing feedback. A quick input or timely decision sometimes saves days or even months of effort, and can make or mar a project.

During the pandemic when the associates do not experience conventional touchpoints, and non-verbal communication is slim, managers must be sensitive to the team’s situation and constantly give a feeling of being there for them.

What self-care strategies do you adopt and recommend?

With due respect to aspects of confidentiality and sensitivity of information, for a majority of scenarios, leadership need not be a lonely path. Leaning on the team, being open about strengths and weaknesses, helping them understand priorities and trying to bring cheer and energy to every conversation are all important self-care and team care behaviours. It is important that your team understands the real you. Letting the team second-guess what your thoughts are, especially during important conversations and assignments, is a potential stress-inducer, besides derailing the actual work. Managers should make an effort to understand their team and be understood. I also practise meditation and strive to inculcate a holistic purpose for life. Cycling and jump rope are my favourite exercise routines.

What would you say to managers who are technology sceptics and feel that virtual workplaces have compromised their ability to micromanage?

I believe that the stated scepticism of those managers comes from their deep care for their team members and the delivery outcomes. They should learn to gently move the onus and accountability to the team and make it a participatory endeavour rather than a matter of invigilation.

Encouraging associates to watch out for each other promotes a healthy culture of mentorship and takes away the burden of a manager monitoring everyone and everything. Being approachable and accommodating helps the team to push the insight to you voluntarily rather than having to chase them for updates.

How can managers motivate team members to take ownership?

If managers spend time explaining the big picture, and help teams understand the relevance and value of the job to themselves and the organization, there is a higher chance of ownership. It is important to let the team express concerns and constraints, so that they can approach the work with full commitment. Fear of failure is a major derailer, and managers can play a big role in assuring the team to tackle the same. Another key factor is to let the team know that they are making a difference, constantly, and not once in six months or a year.

Why is it important to be a team player?

Belongingness to a cause is a powerful motivator. It brings our best selves to the fore and enhances what and how we learn and grow. Being part of a team and contributing to the betterment of that ecosystem makes one lead a more fulfilling life. Even if you are an individual consultant with a subscription model of a few hours of work per week, try to associate yourself with the team’s principles and work for their mission. There are other practical advantages of reciprocity – leaning on others during tough times, learning new skills, visibility, and amplified fun.

How can managers support team members who are most effective when left alone to work on a task rather than forced to collaborate?

It is important to understand the nature of collaboration, and clarify it to the associates. There could be hesitations ranging from ownership of the work output or unwillingness to share ideas, especially if the environment is very competitive. Sometimes associates from separate groups do not collaborate well as their measures are not aligned or each group measures for different outcomes.

Collaboration must be seen as a means to an end. Forcing people to collaborate without a clear view on the expectations can be counter-productive. Managers must provide the empowerment and assurance while trying to bring individual performers together, and give some settling time before they become a collaborative team.

What can managers do to ensure that their feedback is kind and constructive?

Every associate has a mental model of their manager. It is important that this perception has some elements of “my manager wants me to be better and does everything to support me and the team” in the associate’s mind. Managers should be sensitive to opportunities in the day-to-day grind of the work to improve their reputation on this front. Once empathy and trust are established, feedback will be well received. Speaking sweetly doesn’t help if the associate does not perceive the manager as an ally in their personal growth story or that of the team.",1018,0.710335336625576

American technology firm UST said it would hire over 10,000 employees this year in various geographies to fulfil the growing demand for its solutions.

The 10,000 will include 2,000 entry-level engineering positions, with key skills in Digital Transformation, Cybersecurity, Cloud Infrastructure, Java, Data Science & Engineering, Application Development and Modernization, AI/ML, Automation (RPA/IPA). It will hire across regions such as North America, South America, Europe, APAC (India, Israel, Malaysia, Singapore) and Australia.

“These new hires will support the ongoing development of our industry-leading products and platforms that will scale with the considerable growing demand for our solutions. Working with UST means standing up for something while standing out—touching billions of lives as you tackle fresh challenges and co-create meaningful change.”, Manu Gopinath, Joint COO, UST said.

The company recently said that it did not have any immediate plans to bring back their staff to offices, even as it launched a vaccination drive for its over 15,000 employees and their dependents in India. It is looking at creating a hybrid workplace over the long term.

IT firms such as TCS, Infosys and Wipro have given timelines recently on when they expect their employees to return to work.

India's largest software exporter TCS has renewed its sponsorship for the TCS New York City Marathon through 2029, weeks after announcing that it will be the new title sponsor of the London Marathon, beginning 2022, as it seeks to cement its brand identity in key markets such as North America and the UK.

TCS will invest $30 million to $40 million annually in global running sponsorships and related community programming from 2022 to 2029; that's about $240m to $320m between 2022 to 2029.

It had first signed an 8-year deal to be the title sponsor of the New York City marathon in 2013, replacing ING.

""We sponsor running events across the world because we want to inspire local communities to live healthy and active lifestyles, and also because of the obvious parallels between marathons and the growth and transformation journeys that we help our customers undertake,"" Surya Kant, Chairman, North America, TCS, said.

""Running a marathon makes you believe that there is nothing you can't do. You're building on belief,"" he added.

TCS' effort to connect with local communities in geographies such as North American and the UK also makes business sense. These are its biggest markets in terms of revenues and software companies have been increasingly stepping up local hiring in these regions.

That apart, TCS and Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran is a passionate long-distance runner and has finished marathons in Amsterdam, Boston, Chicago, Berlin, Mumbai, New Delhi and Tokyo. He completed his fastest marathon or personal record (PR) at TCS New York City Marathon (2014) with a finishing time of 5 hr 00 min 52 sec.

Chandra had also invoked his passion for marathons in his address to Tata Sons employees a few years ago. ""Our job is to run our marathon — not to be distracted by somebody else’s sprint,"" he had said in his 2018 letter to employees. ​

As part of the sponsorship, TCS will launch a new version of its TCS New York City Marathon App that will have augmented reality (AR) features that became popular for virtual races during the pandemic.

The new version will include features to support both in-person and virtual runners along with surprise-and-delight AR experiences.

TCS will also donate $4 million to NYRR’s youth and community programs including Rising New York Road Runners, a free, nationwide NYRR program that incorporates physical education into the school day.",426,0.6929655075073242

TCS reported a consolidated profit of Rs 9,008 crore for the quarter ending June 2021, registering a 2.6 percent sequential decline due to lower other income, and missing analysts' expectations.

On July 14, Infosys reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 5,195 crore for the quarter, growing 2.3 percent sequentially.

The next day, Wipro reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 3,242.6 crore, up 35.7 percent year-on-year (YoY) and 9 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ).

Infosys and Wipro numbers cheered investors and both stocks hit their 52-week highs after their Q1 results. However, TCS appears to have failed to impress the market. The stock has been under selling pressure since its June-quarter results.

Global financial firm Citi gave a sell call on TCS after its Q1 numbers with a reduced target price due to lower-than-expected revenues. The weakness in the India business was expected, it said.

The brokerage said the stock's valuation was high at FY20-23 EPS (earnings per share) CAGR estimate of 7 percent.

Analysts prefer Infosys to Wipro & TCS

While analysts are positive on all the three from a long-term perspective, they seem to prefer Infosys to Wipro and TCS for the short to medium term.

""My favorite is Infosys, and I believe investors should keep a higher weightage of their portfolio invested on Infosys. Infosys' growth was very consistent over the last 15 quarters, and the revenue growth of 4.5 percent in the previous quarter is among the top quartile performance among the last 15 quarters,"" said Ashis Biswas, Head of Technical Research at CapitalVia Global Research.

Biswas expects the connected systems on the cloud will produce massive amounts of data and data analytics and AI-driven automation will be the next big growth engine for the company.

TCS management remained positive on growth prospects for FY22. Infosys management raised its FY22 revenue growth guidance to 14-16 percent from 12-14 percent, while Wipro management guided for a 5-7 percent QoQ dollar revenue growth for Q2 post the 12.2 percent QoQ revenue growth in Q1FY22, Jyoti Roy- DVP- Equity Strategist, Angel Broking, said.

""While we continue to remain positive on the IT sector, given the strong demand environment, Infosys continues to be our top pick in the large-cap IT space, given continued large deal wins and reasonable valuations followed by Wipro and TCS,"" said Roy.

Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities, also prefers Infosys. ""In terms of upside potential, Infosys, TCS and Wipro—in that order—are the preferred stocks in the IT space based on their Q1FY22 results and guidance,"" said Jasani.

""Wipro has caught up to a large extent on earnings and valuation differential after the improvement in their numbers over the past few quarters. Infosys has positively surprised the street by raising its revenue guidance for FY22. TCS continues to show strength in core segments despite the Q1 miss on India revenue and continues to gain market share,"" said Jasani.

Rajesh Palviya, VP - Technical and Derivative Research, Axis Securities finds Infosys and Wipro attractive in the near term setup.

""Infosys may scale up towards Rs 1,660-1,680 in the short term; Rs 1,520-1,480 are likely to act as strong support in the near term,"" he said.

""The chart pattern of Wipro suggests that we can see another 5-8 percent up move in the stock towards Rs 630-660 in the near term while Rs 550-535 may act as good support on the lower side,"" said Palviya.

IT sector teeming with positivity

IT sector is enjoying a dream run in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic as the dependence on technology has grown and the demand scenario looks robust.

IT firms have report healthy growth in banking financial services and insurance (BFSI), healthcare, retail, and manufacturing segments while there is increased demand for digital transformation, cloud migration,

artificial intelligence, the internet of things, blockchain, etc, experts point out.

""The backlog of orders and deals has increased much better, leading to a larger upgrade in the outlook for the sectoral players. This is leading to an upside in earnings forecasts and stock target price due to a rise in ratings and valuations,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

""The sector is likely to outperform the market in the short to long-term basis. Investors can increase their exposure in this defensive and high-quality sector, in such a highly valued market, by buying into branded

large and mid-caps IT companies,"" said Nair.

The Nifty has jumped 104 percent, while Nifty IT has surged 148 percent since March 2020 lows.

""The sector is in a re-rating cycle and this trend is likely to persist over the medium term,"" said Palviya.

""The information technology space is marked by companies having strong balance sheets and playing on the current trend of digitisation. Even at the current levels, the IT sector valuations are reasonable. Thus, we recommend an overweight stance on the sector,"" he said.

No year has seen a contrast as stark as the pandemic year when it comes to IT hiring. TCS, Infosys and Wipro have gone from a net decline of 9,000 in hiring at the start of FY21 to a record addition of 40,000 employees for the quarter that went by amid soaring demand and rising attrition. All this in a span of one year.

As Wipro’s chairman Rishad Premji said in his letter to shareholders, with technology at the forefront of economic recovery and the shift to digital, demand will far outstrip the supply. Indian IT firms are clearly looking to address this issue, by stepping up hiring and doling out incentives.

Hiring in Q1

Hiring in top IT firms jumped to over 40,000 for the quarter ending June 30, 2021 as the demand for talent is on the rise as companies continue to sign large deals.

Infosys signed $2.6 billion in deal wins and Wipro signed eight large deals with a total contract value of around $715 million. TCS won $8.1 billion in deals in the quarter.

To cater to this growing demand, IT majors made record hiring in the June quarter.

TCS added over 20,000 employees, its highest addition in a single quarter, taking the total employees to over 5 lakh.

Infosys added 8,300 and Wipro 12,000, which is the highest in a decade. Wipro now has more than 2 lakh employees. These companies also have robust hiring plans in place for both lateral and fresh entries in the coming quarters.

While TCS will hire 40,000 freshers in FY22, Infosys and Wipro are upping their fresher hiring this year. Infosys will add 35,000 freshers in the year, up from 26,000 it had shared earlier. Wipro said it will hire 9,000 from campuses in FY22, adding 33 percent more in the year. It will also roll out 30,000 offer letters to campus hires in the later part of this fiscal, who will join Wipro in FY23.

Rising attrition

This is in a bid to combat growing attrition, one of the biggest challenges the companies face. The attrition rate has been growing over the last couple of quarters for IT firms.

While TCS’ attrition stood at 8.6 percent, for Infosys and Wipro, the spike has been sharp at 13.9 percent and 15.5 percent, respectively, from 10.9 percent and 12.1 percent in the previous quarters. Talent is one of the biggest challenges facing these IT players.

Thierry Delaporte, CEO, Wipro, in an interaction with Moneycontrol, said, “This is a challenge not for us, but for the entire industry. I have not yet seen a company that does not have attrition that is not going up.

“There is very high demand and even our clients are exposed to attrition on their side. So these numbers are a reflection of the fact that we are in a different world, where there is a lot more fluidity of the labor market, where you are one click away from responding favorably to another opportunity. So that's the world we are in. And so we need to adapt to that and we need to be able to respond and connect.”

That is also one of the reasons why companies are doubling down on freshers and are offering incentives.

UB Pravin Rao, COO, Infosys during the earnings call on July 14 said rising attrition was a concern and the company had gone for multiple employee interventions, including promotions for retaining the workforce.

TCS rolled out hikes effective April 2021 and Infosys in July 2021. Wipro is rolling out its hikes for over 80 percent of employees effective September 2021.",636,0.057243755230536826

""We also look forward to expanding our community engagement through our STEM initiatives, to help nurture the next generation of local technology leaders in our schools,"" Kant said.

To lay the groundwork for a pipeline of skilled talent in Arizona, TCS has implemented its Ignite My Future in School (IMFIS) and goIT programmes, partnering with Arizona State University's Innovation Lab to bring goIT's Design Thinking model of identifying alternative strategies and solutions to solve problems to the curriculum.

""The year 2020 saw TCS become the largest software and IT services provider in the UK topping TechMarketView's ranking for the first time, a real testament to how resilient and innovative the business has become as it continues to grow and nurture an enviable UK client base,"" Marc Hardwick, research director at TechMarketView, said.",492,0.9812836721539497

Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy made the announcement at an employee townhall on July 13th, 2021, hours after the e-commerce major raised a $3.6 Billion from a clutch of investors at a valuation of $37.6 Billion, one of the largest fund-raises by a single company in recent times.

A Flipkart spokesperson confirmed the move to a hybrid working model by the end of year but did not provide more details.

Flipkart has over 16,000 full time employees and except for a few critical roles, most of them have been working from home, since March 2020, after the outbreak of the Covid19 pandemic.

It had announced in March this year that it will cover the Covid19 vaccine cost for all of Flipkart and Myntra's employees and their dependents. It began vaccinating its frontline staff in May.

As more and more employees get vaccinated, many companies are working on a hybrid working model. TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan for instance, said last week that the IT company plans to get its over 5 lakh employees double vaccinated by September and get them back to office on a regular basis.

This would be the first step in implementing the software major's 25*25 vision, where it does not expect more than 25 percent of its employees to work in office by the year 2025.

Globally companies such as Apple, Amazon, Google and TikTok have announced return to workplace plans, though this was met with a lukewarm response, as more and more employees prefer to work from home indefinitely.

Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy also wrote to employees on its fund raise, calling it 'one of the most significant investments in the digital ecommerce ecosystem in India.' Moneycontrol has seen the email. He also announced an ESOP buyback to reward employees in the email.

""Each of you has played a critical role in helping the company reach this milestone, and the entire management team at Flipkart and Myntra are grateful for your commitment and dedication.""

""As many of you know, it has always been our endeavour to provide our employees with an opportunity to liquidate their vested options regularly. This year we are pleased to announce a buyback of 5% of the past three years vested options. We are offering employees an additional buyback of 5% of all vested options as we stay committed to wealth creation for you,"" he said.

The ESOP buyback, worth Rs 600 crore, is expected to benefit 6,000 employees. The funding round is a precursor to Flipkart's public listing in the US, expected in the next 12-18 months.

Rajesh Gopinathan, the CEO of TCS, one of the world's most-valued IT companies, welcomed the upcoming Internet IPO rush in India, stating that high-risk capital is very good news and a sign of maturity of the Indian capital market.

""I think it is overall very good and a sign of maturity of the capital market that money is being put at a risk basis. The real strength of the US is that risk capital is available in sufficient quantity,"" he said, in response to a question from Moneycontrol. He was speaking after TCS' earnings for the first quarter.

Gopinathan further said that while this is high-risk capital, the fact that it is available is very good news as it will feed innovative capacity in the ecosystem, leading to a significant positive impact.

""Personally I don't understand many of those valuation parameters but finance is an empirical science at the end of the day so whatever is happening that sets the theory going forward. So it is a step in the right direction,"" he said.

While TCS is the second-most valued company in India by market cap after Reliance Industries, it is also one of the most valued information technology companies in the world. It raced past Accenture on a couple of occasions to become the most valued IT company globally by market capitalization. As of July 9th, 2021, it had a market cap of 11.87 lakh crore.

Gopinathan's comments come against the backdrop of food delivery platform Zomato's IPO, which is set to open next week, making it the first Internet unicorn to list in India. Apart from Zomato, Paytm, Policybazaar, Mobikwik, Nykaa, and Delhivery are also firming up plans for a public listing in India, even as there is buzz of Flipkart and Freshworks listing in the US.

When asked if TCS will look to acquire startups, Gopinathan said, ""We will engage with the startup ecosystem but we don't have the enthusiasm to set up a private equity fund or get into investment.""

One way TCS partners with startups is through its COIN or Co-Innovation Network, which it launched in 2006. TCS uses COIN to bring together experts from start-ups, research, academics, and the corporate world to work on innovations for its Fortune 1000 clients. The program has an accelerator, reference architecture, start-up partner program, and an Integration team.

While TCS is steering clear of direct investments, its parent Tata Sons has huge ambitions for the e-commerce space, which is currently dominated by Amazon, Walmart-owned Flipkart, with Reliance Industries also expanding aggressively through JioMart.

It is building a super app under Tata Digital, with plans to add categories such as groceries, health, education, entertainment, electronics, fashion, travel, beauty and lifestyle. It also plans to leverage the strength of group companies such as Titan, Voltas, Trent, Tata Consumer Products, Tata Motors, Vistara, Tata AIG, Tata Capital and Taj Hotels, offering users an array of services in one app. While it acquired a majority stake in BigBasket and 1MG, it also invested in CureFit.",507,0.9999905526638031

India’s largest IT services provider TCS aims to get over 5 lakh employees vaccinated by September and get them back to office on a regular basis, said Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO.

Speaking to media persons on July 9, a day after the company announced its results, Gopinathan said, “We are all hoping to get our folks vaccinated with a second shot by September. Once people get the second shot, we will be getting back to the office on a more regular basis.”

This will be the first step in implementing the company’s 25×25 vision, where the firm does not expect more than 25 percent of the employees to work in office only 25 percent of the time.

“For our longer-term vision, while we laid out the vision 25×25, it needs to be done in a very deliberate way. We can’t directly go to 25×25. So the path to that will be first to get back to the regular operating model and then systematically roll out,” Gopinathan said.

On queries about if employees are willing to come back to work, he said that there is a balance of both, those wanting to come back and initial fear, which is now coming down as vaccination gains pace. “There was a significant surge in the number of people wanting to come back and the second wave was a big dampener. People got really scared about what unfolded,” he said.

Responding to queries about the third wave and the impact it can have on the workforce, he said that even the first dose of vaccine can take the edge off severe infections.

“The biggest problem in every wave was a sense of helplessness. If you can ensure that the intensity of it is managed and it can be taken care of at home that would be a big part of the war that is won. Even in the third wave if we can reduce the intensity I think as a country we will be able to go through it later,” he added.",351,-0.9999902248382568

India’s largest information technology (IT) services provider, Tata Consultancy Services, popularly known by its acronym TCS, has crossed the five-lakh employee milestone.

That makes it the second-largest employer in the country after the Indian Railways – and that’s saying a lot.

In addition, the company continues to hire freshers, at least 40,000 in FY22, yet retaining its attrition at 8.6 percent, the lowest in the industry.

How does it balance so much and so well?

Ask Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO, TCS, on achieving the milestone, and he says, rightly, that there are not too many organizations this size.

“I grew up in a railway colony and I used to say that it is not a matter of 400,000 and 500,000, there are not too many organisations that size. We are going through it as a living experiment,” he points out.

Not like retail

Unlike sectors like retail, which employ lakhs of people and the talent level goes down, the TCS case is different. “This is a space that is very exciting for us and we are focused on it. We are continuously exploring to see what we can do to leverage this size. How do we best make use of it,” says Gopinathan.

However, keeping such a large organization is complex. How does TCS not only manage to retain employees but also stay nimble?

“Keeping the organization nimble is the core of our organizational structure. It is to keep on breaking the organization into small autonomous entities that can operate in a fairly independent manner with a supportive ecosystem, which takes away some of the volatility of the environment,” Gopinathan explains.

That alone isn’t enough though, given the scale of the company. According to TCS employees, it is a combination of factors.

Consider this. TCS is one of the largest recruiters from campuses. During the earnings call on July 8 after the announcement of Q1 FY22 results, Milind Lakkad, Chief Human Resources officer, said that the company will hire 40,000 freshers this year, if not more.

Big recruiter

This recruitment is not confined to India but also, the globe.

Given the large fresher intake, the company has invested heavily in training and development initiatives to get freshers ready for projects in a short time.

One such initiative to cut down training time is through the platform FrescoPlay, which uses analytics to design individual-focused training programmes.

According to sources Moneycontrol spoke to, the idea is to deploy freshers immediately into projects rather than spending time training them once they come on board.

Secondly, the company extensively hires through NQT (National Qualifier Test), an assessment platform designed by TCS iON that measures the candidates’ cognitive ability, and skills relevant to their job.

People who are in their final and pre-final year, with up to two years of work experience, can apply for the test. Apart from Tata group companies like TCS and Titan, other firms such as Happiest Minds use NQT for hiring.

Vast database

TCS has built up a vast database of candidates through NQT that it can leverage for hiring needs in the future. The NQT, which is open for freshers with less than two years of experience across India, was conducted on May 1 and 13 this year.

The other important aspect is flexibility in roles that the company offers to employees, says a TCS veteran, who has been working in the company for close to 20 years now. It gives employees room to choose and train in the domain and technology of their interest at any point in time, and the opportunity to be deployed in those projects.

Take Venkat, who has been working in the company for over a decade now. Over the course of his work, he has moved to multiple roles, starting with Java, then to machine learning, and now cloud architecture. He has worked on both internal and client projects and learnt in the process, an opportunity, which he doubts any other workplace offers.

Another employee, Vinod, who has put in over a decade of experience in TCS, says: “Even before FrescoPlay, we had internal platforms, where employees can register and upskill or cross train in any technologies free of cost. At that time, not many companies were making it free for all employees. TCS has been doing this for a long time.”

Diverse projects

This flexibility is a function of large and diverse projects the company handles, and internal products and platforms that TCS builds inhouse.

Unlike its global rival Accenture, and local peers such as Wipro, which in addition to building in-house products make acquisitions that complements its portfolio, TCS has been building digital products and platform solutions in-house for its clients. It would not be a stretch to say that the company’s robust digital portfolio has been built from scratch!

This also gives the employees more opportunities to work on multiple technologies, says Vinod.

At the end of the day, it is about how an organization structures itself, no matter the size. Says CEO Gopinathan: “We have been facing questions that we are too large… There are organisations that work efficiently, be it railways or armed forces. The question is how we structure ourselves to be efficient and work in a dynamic way.” He’s hit the nail on the head.",888,0.5232475876808167

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCS

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported revenue growth of 2.4% QoQ CC in 1QFY22, below our estimate of 3.6%. This was primarily due to sharp de-growth in its India business (-14.1% QoQ) on account of the second COVID wave. Excluding the impact in regional markets, core business growth of 4.1% QoQ CC was broadly in-line. The EBIT margin at 25.5% (marginally above our estimates) declined 130bp QoQ, primarily due to annual wage hikes (170bp impact). TCS delivered another quarter of strong deal wins (USD8.1b), with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x, despite the absence of any mega deals. TCS has consistently reported a book-to-bill ratio above 1.0x, without support from USD500m+ deals (4QFY21 record TCV comprised just one such deal). We see this as positive for the company as it should improve growth visibility. Consistent performance from TCS, post the initial phase of the COVID pandemic, indicates continued strength in the tech spending environment, along with its ability to capture outsized market share. Management commentary on enterprise demand, especially cloud, implies a positive outlook for peers as well.



Outlook

Our TP implies 27x FY23E EPS. While we remain positive on the company, we maintain Neutral given the rich multiples.

India's largest IT services firm TCS added 20,409 employees in the quarter ending June 2021, highest ever in a quarter, taking the total employees to over 5 lakh.

The company has also reported an attrition rate of 8.6 percent, the lowest in the industry. The IT services major will hire 40,000 freshers in FY22, same as that of FY21.

Moneycontrol earlier reported that the company is likely to meet its 5 lakh employee milestone in the June quarter.

While the five lakh milestone would make TCS the largest Indian technology employer, globally it will come second to Accenture, which already has 5.37 lakh employees. While Infosys has an employee strength of nearly 2.5 lakh, HCL Tech and Wipro have 1.6 lakh and 1.9 lakh respectively. To put this in perspective, TCS will only be second to Indian Railways, a government-owned enterprise that has over a million employees. Private conglomerates such as Aditya Birla Group for example have over 1.2 lakh employees, while L&T has over 3.37 lakh and Reliance Industries has nearly 2 lakh employees. ​

TCS registered Rs 45,111 crore in revenues for the quarter, up 18.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) and Rs 9008 crore in net profits, a 28.5 percent YoY growth.

The company signed deals worth $8.1 billion in the first quarter of the year.

N Ganapathy Subramaniam, Chief Operating Officer & Executive Director, said: “We overcame the challenges posed by the second wave of Covid-19 in India taking some practical approaches and am satisfied that the delivery of all our client engagements was kept on track. We once again had a superior quarter with a TCV of $8.1 billion which is broad-based across markets and verticals.

On June 21, Airtel and Tata Group’s IT arm TCS announced partnership for implementation of 5G solutions, starting pilot from January 2022. A move that would help the latter strengthen its capability and scale and the former reduce the cost of the deployment, say analysts.

What does the partnership entail?

TCS will implement the 5G solutions it has developed for Airtel. Tata Group has developed 5G solutions using Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN), a part of telecommunication architecture. O-RAN is similar to open source in software, that is, it is not proprietary. It can be used by any company to develop solutions hence making it flexible for more companies to develop solutions. Increased participation brings down the cost for 5G implementation.

TCS has developed solution based on O-RAN and will be commercially available on January 2022, when the pilot deployment will begin.

What is in it for TCS?

This partnership is important for TCS, for whom it is a key focus area, as emphasized by its Chairman N Chandrasekaran during the recent annual general meeting (AGM).

During the TCS AGM on June 10, Chandrasekaran, chairman, Tata Group said, “5G is new technology and TCS will play a significant role both in the development of firmware, which is required to develop the necessary technology (for 5G solutions). But most importantly, leveraging the 5G and create large number of applications in various sectors. This is an important growth area for TCS.”

The partnership is clearly in line with this vision, where TCS can strengthen its capabilities and eventually scale its solutions and gain market share when 5G deployment gains pace in India and globally.

Ray Wang, Principal Analyst & Founder, Constellation Research, a research and advisory firm, said that TCS’ O-RAN based solution is a key capability in their telecom stack that will give Airtel a competitive advantage and drive down the cost of 5G deployment in India.

“(With this partnership) TCS also gains the capability to help other telcos with both the technology and implementation and Airtel will save a lot of time and money in the rollout,” Wang added.

A Bengaluru-based analyst explained that 5G implementation has more software component than 4G and hence there is more need for technology service providers. Without partnerships with IT firms, telcos will run into integration challenges, making this partnership important, given the huge opportunity 5G provides.

5G implementation market

An analysis by UBS pegs that 5G rollout is a $30 billion opportunity for Indian IT firms. The market is clearly huge and it is not lost on the IT service providers.

For instance Tech Mahindra has partnered with Japanese telecom major Rakuten for 5G implementation. According to several media reports, Tech Mahindra wants to partner with the telecom major Jio for 5G implementation. Reliance-owned Jio, which is one of the key players in the 5G space, is expected to launch 5G smartphone in partnership with Google this week, according to reports.

Globally too, such partnerships are common place and will likely continue. For instance, Vodafone has partnered with Capgemini for 5G implementation.

But…

Though the opportunity is huge, benefits from these partnerships are unlikely to be significant, point out some.

Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO, Everest Group, said, “These partnership rarely mean very much and are mostly a signaling vehicle to show that the parties are committed to 5G. That is not to say that TCS will not capture some revenue from this but in the end Airtel will work with other vendors and TCS will work with other 5G networks. So the partnership is good publicity but is unlikely to contribute significantly to either party’s market success.”

Telcos like Airtel, Jio and Vodafone work with major IT service providers, and other players will get a part of the pie too.

In terms of revenues too, it might not amount to a significant value, at least not in the beginning. “This is a new technology and there is a lot of uncertainty between pilot to implementation. So this would be a step by step process,” explained Pareekh Jain, founder, Pareekh Consulting.

It is a question that shareholders asked repeatedly at the Infosys annual general meeting over the weekend. It is a question that is likely to haunt India's second-largest software exporter this week, as it prepares to meet officials from India's Finance Ministry on June 22.

Why are there so many technical glitches in the new income tax e-filing portal, and, more importantly, why does an IT company that works for some of the world's biggest corporations and countries struggle to execute a project at home?

While Infosys has assured shareholders that several glitches raised initially have been resolved and as new features are being introduced, they will address more concerns in the next few weeks, the episode has put the spotlight once again on one of Indian IT’s biggest bugbears: executing Indian government projects.

Govt projects: Indian IT’s Achilles’ heel

To be sure, this is not the first time Infosys has been pulled up for a government project and neither is it the only company that has faced an issue.

While Infosys faced similar problems when it was working on the MCA21 (Ministry of Corporate Affairs) and the GSTN (Ministry of Finance) projects, Wipro has had its fair share of troubles with projects such as Employee State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) project. TCS, which runs India's passport project, the Indian Railways’ IRCTC site, and India Post’s digital project, is an outlier and has had relatively better success here.

Industry executives Moneycontrol spoke to said a combination of factors like undefined scope, inflexible milestones, delay in payment, and lack of ownership from the government on the projects are some of the reasons.

Lack of flexibility

“Government procurement is straitjacketed but an IT project is complex, because you need to make changes as you go along. The GST project, for example, saw changes with every council meeting, not just the rate but the structure, the role of the Centre and the states,” said R Chandrasekhar, former Nasscom president, who also served as IT secretary and telecom secretary.

Various executives, on condition of anonymity, said IT companies have been increasingly wary of taking up government projects, resulting in smaller, lesser-known firms bidding for key e-governance projects.

Random scope changes

“Suppose you are an artist. They ask you for a detailed sketch of a monkey. Then when you are about to submit it, they change the subject to a donkey,” an analyst tracking the space for a decade outlined the almost arbitrary way scope and milestones are defined in critical projects.

TCS’ secret sauce

TCS has a very different approach because they tend to use Indian government projects as a training ground to see how they can learn from the complexity and replicate this in the way they architect projects for various countries.

“They want understanding and scale, not necessarily a profit margin,” a former top executive of an IT firm said.

A second executive who used to lead the public services division for a top IT company said: “TCS does a very good job of going back to the government and asking for scope changes regularly.”

Another former executive of a Bengaluru-based IT firm said these projects are awarded on a fixed price basis to the lowest bidder, on the assumption that requirements don't change and the initial requests stay as it is.

“It is not like building a bridge. Milestones and requirements in tech projects are always changing and evolving, especially in complex projects such as the ESIC or tax e-filing portal, as these are accessed by lakhs of people,” he said.

Lack of govt ownership

The other factor is a lack of ownership as bureaucrats get transferred regularly. “The government has no clearly defined executive sponsor or ownership. In the US, even counties have CIOs. Here we don't have an understanding of what can be done.”

Industry executives acknowledge that they also don't deploy their best resources for these projects. “The contract is awarded to the lowest bidder. Hence, the profit companies earn is already less. Plus, employees find projects abroad more attractive,” one of the executives quoted above said.

Why govt projects don't make business sense

The India market contributes to less than 5 percent of revenues for top software exporters. In FY21, revenues from the country for TCS was 5.1 percent, and Infosys' stood at 3 percent. Wipro's business from state-run enterprises was $121.8 million, barely 2 percent of the company's $8.1 billion annual revenue number.

HCL Tech does not share India revenues separately. However, revenues from the rest of the world, which includes all countries, barring Americas and Europe, account only for about 8.9 percent.

IT companies have also had a poor experience when it comes to payments. There have been instances where delays have stretched to days and months or didn't come at all. A few years ago, Nasscom said payments to the tune of Rs 5,000 crore that was due from the government to companies were stuck.

Poor payment experience

“There is not a single (govt) project Infosys has done where the company has not lost money. That’s a reality when dealing with governments,"" Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy said six years ago.

He had further said that the government needs to solve pain points such as low price, delayed payments, changing requirements mid-stream, and not allocating enough time. These efforts would go a long way in making Digital India a success.

For instance, in 2009, Wipro won a Rs 1,182-crore project, ESIC’s Project Panchdeep, aimed at automating healthcare services to over 6 crore beneficiaries across the country. In 2011, ESIC, in a public announcement, said that the portal was facing glitches. Wipro responded, stating that the company’s best resources are working on the project to restore the portal.

Wipro completed the project in February 2012, and maintained it till 2016. One of the key issues the company faced was collection. Media reports from 2016 note that Wipro was mulling legal action to recover payment from the government for the completion of the project.

Again, in 2019, Wipro terminated its National Register of Citizens project for Assam over non-payment of dues. The project expired in October 2019, and it was not renewed.

“Large companies can survive this blow to liquidity but smaller companies can get wiped out. We need to have standard contracts based on outcome and a good dispute- settlement mechanism,"" Chandrasekhar said.

Will a UIDAI-like model help?

There are a couple of things the government and companies can do. Experts point to the UIDAI model, led by Infosys co-founder and chairman Nandan Nilekani, which has issued 124 crore Aadhaar cards and is easily one of the world’s biggest technology projects. The government now relies heavily on Aadhaar to implement its welfare schemes.

Mindtree co-founder Krishnakumar Natarajan said the company's experience of working on Aadhaar was very smooth because it was manned by technocrats who understood what needed to be done.

Mindtree was chosen by UIDAI as the primary application development partner and its solutions include a data warehouse to capture all enrolment-related information of over 1.2 billion Indian residents, a data management system to handle over 100 million transactions a day, and a design to manage 8 petabytes of raw data.

“The maturity of IT usage is just picking up. We need to try and get industry expertise. People are willing to volunteer,” Natarajan said.

Roping in tech architects

For the Aadhaar project, some of the best technology architects, handpicked from top IT companies and consulting firms such as McKinsey, took a one-year sabbatical to work on the world's biggest identity project. Some found the work so fulfilling that they even extended their sabbatical.

“Projects of national importance can be jeopardised because of weak systems. The government needs to form a core committee with public and private sector experts for crucial projects that have a huge economic impact. The program management needs to be run like corporations,” the first executive quoted above said.

Interestingly, there were many suggestions that IT firms can work with startups which have enabled seamless transactions for millions. A user on Twitter said: ""If offered, ClearTax could have developed a much better income tax and GST portal than Infosys.” Several users backed this view.

Archit Gupta, founder & CEO, Clear Tax, a financial services firm focused on taxation, said in a tweet, “We are ready to provide a version of ClearTax for the National Portal and serve. We have a scalable, ready solution for all taxes.”

Can startups do better than IT firms?

There are mixed opinions on whether startups can really do better than large IT firms.

“Startups can take up parts of the solution, but they do not have the scale, insights into government functioning, capability to build such a massive and complex system end-to-end. They can definitely partner with larger service providers,” said Everest Group Vice President Yugal Joshi.

Mrinal Rai, Principal Analyst, ISG, believes the solution is not to consider startups or smaller niche firms. “The idea is to have a startup mindset while executing such projects that includes considering the future state of customer experience as the core criteria of service delivery,"" Rai said.",1539,-0.07472138745444161

Most Indian IT stocks have made healthy gains since last year as the coronavirus outbreak brightened the demand scenario due to a growing dependence on technology and more industries embracing the new normal. Recovery in the US economy and the weakness in the rupee, too, have worked in favour of the sector.

India's second-largest firm, in terms of market-capitalisation, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has been having a good run too. The stock rose more than a percent in early deals on June 18 to Rs 3,357.85, a whisker away from its 52-week high of 3,358.80. It, however, cooled off and erased all gains to end 0.70 percent lower at Rs 3,297 on BSE.

The IT bellwether has outperformed the benchmark Sensex in the last year and in 2021 as well.

As of June 17 closing, TCS had gained 16 percent on BSE in 2021 and rallied 62 percent since June 17, 2020. The Sensex has risen 10 percent this year and 56 percent over the last year.

A few days ago, N Chandrasekaran, Chairman, Tata Sons, said TCS shares had seen over 3,000 percent growth since the company was listed in 2004.

CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said TCS was seeing demand in “three horizons”—digital transformation of technology infrastructure followed by innovating the business models leveraging data and analytics, and finally, cloud ecosystem, where enterprises will collaborate with other adjacent enterprises.

TCS is a global leader. Its profit and revenue have been rising every quarter for the past three quarters. Annual net profits of the company have been improving for the last two years.

Analysts are positive on the stock and even though it is trading near its 52-week high, they say there is steam left in TCS.

Ashis Biswas, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research expects the BFSI vertical to increase its investment in automation in the next two years.

There will be a robust demand scenario across geographies, and the increase in outsourcing is likely to enable profit expansion.

""The company's operating margins have been observed to grow by 130 basis points to 25.9 percent, boosted by higher outsourcing, higher utilisation, lower attrition, and a favourable currency mix. In addition, the management expects double-digit growth in FY22 due to substantial contract wins,"" Biswas said.

He has a “buy” call on the stock with a target price of Rs 3,740, which is a 13 percent upside from the current level of Rs 3,320.

Devarsh Vakil, Deputy Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities, has an “add” recommendation on the stock, with a target price of Rs 3,470, based on 28 times March-23E EPS with EPS CAGR at 17 percent over FY21-23E.

Vakil said COVID-19 has accelerated digital transformation and the need for resilient IT solutions, presenting significant business opportunities for companies like TCS.

""Accelerated cloud adoption, vendor consolidation, and an uptick in transformational deals will support the flight to quality. Demand is expected to increase for services around digital channels, collaboration and

workplace transformation,"" he said.

Pipeline is expanding in areas of cloud, workplace transformation, cost efficiency and automation, Vakil said.

Wipro’s Thierry Delaporte drew Rs 64 crore ($8.8 million) for FY21, making him the highest paid CEO in IT compared to his peers in Infosys and TCS.

To be sure, compensation for Delaporte, who took charge as the CEO in July 2020, included salary of Rs 9.6 crore, commission of Rs 11.2 crore, Rs 5.5 crore as long-term compensation and Rs 37.81 crore as other income, according to a regulatory filing.

When Delaporte was announced as CEO, he was offered an annual package of Rs 37.9 crore (4.45 million euros) and also stock compensation and other benefits.

“The compensation disclosed for Mr. Thierry Delaporte is for the period from July 6, 2020 to March 31, 2021. It includes components such as a one-time cash award, annual stock grant and one-time grant of RSUs, among other things, as per the terms approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders in July 2020,” the regulatory filing said.

Good Afternoon Shareholders! I would like to welcome all of you to the 26th Annual General Meeting of the Company.

As the requisite quorum is present, I now call the meeting to order.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Due to the coronavirus concerns, lockdown and social distancing norms, we are holding this Annual General Meeting through video conference. This is in compliance with the directions of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. A live streaming of this meeting is also being webcast on NSDL’s website. The Company has taken the requisite steps to enable Members to participate and vote on the items being considered at this AGM.

The Registers as required under the Companies Act, 2013 are open for inspection.

Since the Notice is already circulated duly to the Members, I take the Notice convening the meeting as read.

On November 26, 2020, we lost Padma Bhushan Shri. F. C. Kohli, who was founder and the first CEO of TCS and led the Company for 27 years, navigating multiple technology waves by investing continuously in people and in research and innovation. Shri. Kohli is a true legend who laid the very foundations for India’s spectacular IT revolution and set the stage for the dynamic modern economy. I express a deep gratitude to his indefatigable, influential spirit for shaping TCS and the fabric of TCS culture.

With an unprecedented global crisis created by Covid -19 pandemic, our Company has weathered pandemic very well and has emerged stronger with the agility, resilience and adaptability of our delivery model. This has earned us tremendous goodwill from customers and enhanced our standing in the market.

The need for transformational initiatives to support operational resilience, shift to digital channels, and preference for contactless interactions has resulted in enterprises embarking on various technology initiatives. The Company is very well positioned to benefit from this multi-year technology upgradation cycle, and help customers translate their transformative visions into reality. To articulate the aforesaid mission and aspiration, the Company has adopted a new brand statement “Building on Belief”. The new brand statement reflects that the Company has been guided by a set of strong beliefs, right from the time it was founded. Belief in our core values, belief in putting the customer above all, belief in investing in people and empowering them, belief in constantly trying out new ideas and models, and belief in doing right by all the stakeholder communities we work with.

In terms of performance, the Company swiftly recovered to deliver a sharp growth trajectory over the next nine months after the initial lockdown related disruptions, and exited the year on a very strong note, with an expanded market share, industry-leading profitability and an all-time high order book.

In FY 2021, the Company’s consolidated revenue grew by 4.6% in rupee terms to Rs 1,64,177 crore. The operating margin continued to be industry leading at 25.9% and net profit was Rs 33,388 crore.

In line with the practice of returning 80 to 100 percent free cash flow to shareholders and based on the Company’s performance, the Directors have recommended a final dividend of Rs 15 per equity share taking the total dividend payout for FY 2021 to Rs 38 per equity share, including 3 interim dividends of total Rs 23 per equity share. The Company completed Rs 16,000 crore share buyback at Rs 3,000 per equity share, representing 1.42 percent of the total equity capital. This translates to an aggregate outflow of Rs 33,873 crore in dividend and buyback, resulting in a payout of 95 percent of the free cash flow. Looking at TCS history of buyback, 3 buybacks were completed amounting to Rs 48,000 crore.

Looking back, if you had invested in one TCS share at the issue price of Rs 850 in the IPO in 2004, the value of that investment today in a period of 17 years, would be around Rs 28,000, a return of over 3,000 percent on your investment.

The Company continues to focus on the health and wellbeing of its associates through multiple measures like:

· Setting up of first line Covid Care Centres at TCS premises, hospital admission assistance, home healthcare services, availability of Occupational Hazard Category doctors round the clock, tele medicine.

· Repatriation of onsite associates and families through the Vande Bharat Mission.

· Virtual HR days, daily check-in calls to associates, increased connect sessions with leaders, counselling services and other initiatives focused on improving the employees’ resilience.

The Company had a net addition of 40,185, taking its total associate count to 4,88,649.

The Company is one of the largest employers of women in the world. Sustained efforts to improve gender diversity, through focused hiring, mentoring and coaching women employees, have resulted in women currently accounting for 36.5 percent of the workforce.

TCS’ CSR commitment stems from the 152-year-old legacy of the Tata Group. The Company has continued to empower communities globally through its strategic programs by prioritizing education, skilling, employment and entrepreneurship with a focus to bridge the opportunity gap. In FY 2021, the global community initiatives of TCS reached more than 1.8 million beneficiaries.

As the unprecedented impact of the pandemic hit communities across the globe, TCS focused on building resilience. While the safety and well-being of our employees and ensuring support to our customers were key, it was equally important to continue the mission critical services we are performing around the world to help people transition into this new beginning.





A contribution of Rs 273 crore was made towards COVID-19 Relief Efforts.



We also built capacity for 200 doctors across 22 hospitals, in collaboration with Tata Trusts and CMC Vellore Hospital and Care Institute of Health Sciences.



We provided testing kits, set up modular treatment facilities for at-risk population. TCS’ ensured the activation of contact-less patient care coordination services, virtual consultation and location independent review of patient data during lockdowns supporting over 250,000 patient consultations.



We trained health workers and spread awareness among rural population ensuring wellness of over 450,000 people.



2.5 million meals were distributed to doctors and medical professionals.



Entrepreneurs of our BridgeIT program provided emergency ambulance services for those in rural regions and distributed protective equipment to over 200,000 households.



TCS ensured education needs of over 650,000 students are met, through programs offering at-home uninterrupted learning.



Additionally, the Company through R&D infrastructure engaged in 72 COVID related initiatives around the world, who are working with local, national and international bodies, adopting multiple approaches: leveraging TCS IP, collaborating with partners, and offering individual consultative inputs across many areas, such as drug candidate molecule discovery, COVID data management, diagnostic kits, epidemiological study and management.

Being in second and third waves of the pandemic in India and many other parts of the world, we regret the loss of life due to COVID-19 pandemic and are deeply grateful and have immense respect for every person who risked their life and safety to fight this pandemic.

We will eventually get this pandemic situation under control, but until then, I urge you to stay safe, follow covid discipline, get vaccinated if you are eligible and keep your spirits up.",1593,0.7735003287141974

TCS has been the technology partner of the London Marathon since 2016 and developed an app to support participants in the first virtual London Marathon during the COVID-19 pandemic last year.

""This is a landmark day in our history and we look forward to working with TCS to evolve and grow our digital reach, inspire millions more to become active and develop opportunities to raise even more funds for charities,"" Hugh Brasher, event director of London Marathon Events, said in a statement.

Organisers are hoping to attract a record 50,000 runners for this year's London Marathon on Oct. 3 with another 50,000 people around the world competing in a virtual race.",180,0.9868062734603882

TCS, India's largest software exporter by sales, said it plans to reduce its absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 70 percent by 2025 and achieve zero net emissions by 2030.

It will meet these goals by adding more green buildings, reducing IT systems power usage and by using its platform TCS Clever Energy, which leverages IoT, machine learning and AI to optimise energy consumption across campuses.

""Our net zero goal underlines our renewed commitment to environmental stewardship. To curb emissions and limit global warming to well below 2, all organisations will have to reimagine existing business models and aim for sustainable growth,"" TCS COO NG Subramaniam said.

He added that it will also partner with customers, civil society and governments to lead and shape solutions for a sustainable future.

The new reduction goal was set after the organisation achieved their previous target of reducing their carbon footprint by half by the year 2020. In FY2021 TCS’ footprint was lower than 61.06% compared to baseline year of FY2008 across scope 1 and scope 2.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

According to a press note, TCS will continue its efforts in water conservation and waste management through reduction and recycling initiatives. The company has also eliminated the use of single-use plastic across all their campuses and ensured recycling of all recyclable plastic waste.

TCS’ environmental footprint was reduced significantly in FY2021 due to lockdown and large scale switch to remote work from home arrangements resulted in 97% of employees working from home through the entire year. Due to this, the company’s absolute energy consumption came down by 46.6% and absolute carbon footprint by 48.8%.

TCS, which is also one of the world's most valuable IT companies, is likely to cross the 5 lakh or half a million employee headcount milestone in the next few months, cementing its position as the country's biggest private sector employer.

Indian software company Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) is seeing acceleration in some parts of its business across Europe as the pandemic pushed companies to adopt new technologies more rapidly, a top executive said.

Europe has been the fastest growing region for TCS from where it gets about a third of its annual revenue of $22.17 billion. In the last full year, continental Europe was the only geography that showed growth for TCS.

The pandemic has proven that you can collaborate remotely and certain technologies where adoptions were slow, such as collaboration technologies or cloud, the openness has increased and therefore there is an acceleration, Sapthagiri Chapalapalli, head of TCS Europe, said in an interview.

""When things open up, you also need to be cautious ... cyber security for example has become a very important topic because when you want to open up you need to do it in a secure way.""

TCS, India's largest IT exporter, operates in 19 countries across Europe, catering to dozens of big clients such as Deutsche Bank, SAP, ASML, Infineon, and ABB.

IT service providers are seeing growth in the region as many European companies upgrade their computer technologies, coupled with a shortage of people with the required digital skills, partly because of an aging population.

""The businesses are going to fundamentally change in what they do and technology is going to sit right at the heart of that, and therefore the opportunity is huge,"" Chapalapalli said.

He expects TCS to operate in newer technologies like 5G which could be applied in industries like manufacturing and automotive.

India's largest software exporter TCS said it is setting up 100 COVID-19 vaccination centres across India to inoculate its nearly 5 lakh employees and their dependents, with plans to step up the vaccination drive between the third and fourth week of May.

TCS' Bengaluru-based peers Infosys and Wipro have also unveiled plans this week to vaccinate staff. While Infosys has vaccinated 11,000 people and will order 1.6 million doses to cover all its staff and their kin, Wipro expects to have access to 1 lakh doses of COVID-19 vaccine by early June.

In an earlier interaction, HCL Tech CHRO VV Apparao said that the firm has started vaccination of employees in its Delhi-NCR and Chennai, and has procured a few thousand doses. It is in talks with hospitals and vaccine manufacturers to step up the supply, he added.

TCS vaccination roadmap

“While we have started vaccination camps in a few cities, the drive will be done on a larger scale across the country between the third and fourth week of May. Registrations have already begun for this. TCS is setting up over 100 CVCs (COVID Vaccination Centres) across India. This includes CVCs across TCS offices in 21 cities and CVCs launched with our primary medical partner across 33 cities. For associates that do not have access to CVCs in these areas, we are also enabling access to vaccination centres via a national network of more than 650 hospitals,” TCS said in a statement to Moneycontrol.

The company said it has set up a complete framework for COVID care that takes care of all anticipated aspects. “The process for the vaccination drive will be digitally enabled and technology will be leveraged for end-to-end process management including registration and scheduling via our internal application. We have also launched an internal campaign to stress on the importance of getting vaccinated and ensure our associates have the necessary information and are assisted through the entire process,” the company stated.

It has also charted a multi-vendor and multi-location mechanism, in line with NEGVAC (National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19) guidelines.

TCS employs 4.88 lakh people and the top four IT firms together employ over 10 lakh people in India. The vaccines will be administered to employees free of charge.

In talks with US-based vaccine manufacturers

Some companies are also in talks with vaccine manufacturers in the US. ""We have spoken to Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech—they want to deal with the government for now. We also spoke to senior officials of Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson—they want the government to sort out the indemnity clause,"" UB Pravin Rao, COO, Infosys, said in an interview with Moneycontrol.

Tech Mahindra said it is in talks with Pfizer, Moderna and J&J. TCS and Infosys are yet to respond to Moneycontrol's query on vaccination plans. Industry bodies like NASSCOM and Confederation of Indian Industry too are in talks with government to liberalise vaccine imports.",507,

Top Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) executives’ pay increased 55 percent in FY21 after the company executives took a moderate remuneration in FY20 on the back of the pandemic.

The company CEO Rajesh Gopinathan's remuneration increased 53 percent to Rs 20.4 crore in FY21 compared to the previous fiscal. This includes a salary of Rs 1.27 crore, benefits and allowances amounting to Rs 2.09 crore and Rs 17 crore in commission. Gopinathan took home Rs 13 crore in FY20 and Rs 16.04 crore in FY19.

TCS COO NG Subramaniam’s remuneration increased 60 percent to Rs 16 crore in FY21 from Rs 10 crore in FY20. This includes Rs 1.21 crore in salary, Rs 1.9 crore in benefits and allowances and a commission of Rs 13 crore for FY21.

The company executives last fiscal made a decision to moderate their remuneration to conserve resources in FY20. It resulted in a 15 percent decline last year in remuneration for the key executives.

That is why, TCS FY21 annual report said, the remuneration this fiscal cannot be compared to FY20.

Infosys' Salil Parekh drew Rs 34.67 crore in FY20 and Wipro former CEO Abidali Neemuchwala, who resigned in January 2020, was paid Rs 34 crore. The annual package of Thierry Delaporte, CEO, Wipro, was Rs 37.9 crore (4.45 million euros) and also stock compensation and other benefits. He took charge on July 6, 2020.

FY21 employee compensation

On the back of the pandemic, TCS had paused salary hikes for employees to conserve resources due to the outbreak of the coronavirus. However, with the demand coming back, the company announced wage hikes effective October 2020. The company also announced another round of salary increments effective April 2021 thanks to strong growth momentum as clients increase their tech spending.

“During the course of the year, the total increase is approximately 6.4 percent, after accounting for promotions and other event-based compensation revisions. Employees outside India received a wage increase varying from 2 percent to 6 percent. The increase in remuneration is in line with the market trends in the respective countries,” the annual report read.

Bullish on growth

The company clearly is bullish on the growth opportunity it is seeing in the market, which it expects to sustain in the next few years.

Gopinathan said, “We see this technology shift as the start of a multi-year technology upgradation cycle in which the abundance of native capabilities will constantly expand the art of the possible, opening up new opportunities for technology-driven differentiation.”

N Chandrasekaran, chairman, in a note to shareholders, said TCS sees immense opportunities for growth as it now rides the new technology cycle that has kicked off.

TCS sees immense opportunities for growth as the firm now rides the new technology cycle that has kicked off, said Chairman N Chandrasekaran.

In a note to shareholders in its FY21 annual report, Chandrasekaran said, as the company looked ahead, TCS would also invest in sharpening the capabilities needed to expand its footprint in this large opportunity.

The opportunity comes at the back of the pandemic that changed the way enterprises consume technology.

“To my mind, the year gone by saw an important inflection point that has huge ramifications on enterprise consumption of technology in the coming years, and on demand for your company’s services,” he said.

This acceleration in technology consumption including large scale migration to cloud will benefit TCS. “(It) will drive significant spending on migrating workloads to public clouds in the coming years. Moving workloads to the cloud is just the start of their digital transformation journeys,” he said.

TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said that the enterprise embrace of the hyperscale cloud goes beyond the current year, and typical offerings storage and IT infrastructure in the medium to long term.

“So we see this technology shift as the start of a multi-year technology upgradation cycle in which the abundance of native capabilities will constantly expand the art of the possible, opening up newer opportunities for technology-driven differentiation,” he said.

Gopinathan added: ""It has been a difficult year for everybody. Despite the ferocity with which the second and third waves of the pandemic are now hitting us, we are in a far better place as we exit FY 2021 than we were at the start.""

However, with the work from home model that the firm has established and vaccines, which have hit the market, have put the country in a better position than when it first hit in 2020.

Cognizant's attrition woes are now beginning to hurt its revenue, as it was forced to let go of new business due to its inability to hire talent. It is now putting in place measures that include training, quarterly promotions, and job rotations to provide more opportunities for growth and stanch attrition.

""Although we executed well in the quarter and delivered against our expectations, revenue upside was limited by elevated attrition, reflecting the intensely competitive market for digital talent that we spoke about in our last earnings call. This put some pressure on salaries as rows were filled by lateral hires or contingent workforce. And in some cases, commercial opportunities were forgone due to an inability to source talent,"" Cognizant CEO Brian Humphries told analysts in a call after the software major's first-quarter earnings.

He added that in order to address retention challenges, it has been executing a multi-part plan that includes stepping up its internal engagement efforts, increasing investments in its people through training and job rotations to provide opportunities for career growth. It is also shifting to a quarterly promotion cycle for billable employees and will make 28,000 offers to freshers in India.

However, it anticipates further sequential increases in attrition in Q2 before a gradual recovery in the second half.

For the first quarter ended March, Cognizant reported revenue of $4.4 Billion, a growth of 2.4% year on year in constant currency. The company said its revenue growth could have been higher but lost out due to a shortage of talent.

It has raised its 2021 revenue guidance to 7.0-9.0%, or 5.6-7.6% in constant currency, in contrast to its peers such as TCS, Infosys, and Wipro, which are expected to grow in double digits this year due to higher demand. It has cut its EBIT margin guidance to 15.2%-15.7%, from 15.2%-16.2%. Its annualized quarterly attrition (including BPO) rose to 21% in March 2021, up from 19% in the previous quarter.

While Cognizant continues to see a high attrition rate, its Indian peers reported low attrition rates over the last few quarters, though it is likely to go up with market opening up and opportunities increasing. For instance, TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and HCL Tech reported attrition rates of 7.2%, 15%, 12%, and 9.9% respectively.

Since Humphries took over in April 2019, the company has seen exits across levels. He had indicated a deep surgery as part of an effort to restructure the company and make it more nimble.

Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities have flagged three challenges for the company in the near term. It said Cognizant has lost market share to peers, due to insourcing, with a ransomware attack also impacting service delivery. So it may not benefit from vendor consolidation in financial services. It has also not announced large deals such as TCS, Infosys, or Wipro, missing out on large revenue opportunities.

The company, which lost four employees to Coronavirus, made a commitment to pay two years' salary to their families and also support their children's education up to graduation in India. ""I strongly believe that the real assets of Borosil are not reflected on our Balance Sheet at all. We need to protect these assets in whatever way we can,"" Kheruka said.

The heartwarming gesture inspired Chinmoy Panda, founder and CEO of Mindfire Solutions to do something similar. Panda announced that employees can ask for an interest-free loan, which would reach them in an hour. If an employee succumbs to Covid, apart from life insurance, it will give full salary for 6 months and half salary for the next six months, apart from taking care of the education of their children till graduation.

As the second wave of Coronavirus rips through India, spreading rapidly among a segment that largely escaped its wrath last year- the young, urban working middle class- companies are tweaking policies on insurance, loans, leaves and education to help employees take care of themselves and their families in these tough times.

""Today, 96.5% of our employees globally and over 98% in India are working from home. We have also been supporting our employees and their family members impacted by the pandemic, through a multi-pronged approach. These include home medical care through our partners, enabling hospital admissions, or providing care at our company-run COVID care centers. We have established vaccination centers for our employees and their family. In case of an unfortunate turn of events with an employee, our teams provide immediate support to the grieving family and continue to work with them on their long-term requirements"", an Infosys spokesperson told Moneycontrol.

TCS, which set up Covid Care Centers across 11 cities in India, said it has 500 beds and will be doubling the number. 99% of its employees continue to work from home. ""Health Insurance facilities and Emergency Medical Financial Assistance are available for associates and their families, in case of need. We are also organizing COVID testing camps in our offices,"" a TCS spokesperson said.

Wipro said 3 percent of its employees are currently working from offices, and that they expect this number to drop in the coming weeks as more employees work from home. ""Employees are encouraged to take regular time off from work, to rejuvenate. We have available COVID care centres in various cities for our employees and their immediate family members. In the unfortunate event of an employee testing positive for COVID, we are offering extended paid leaves over and above their regular leaves, to recover.""

""We are encouraging our entire workforce to prioritise the health and safety of themselves and their families, and take time off as needed. We are covering the vaccination costs for all our employees and five of their dependents each, to help combat the spread of the pandemic. All our employees, including our supply chain workforce, can seek an interest free advance on their salaries to address medical emergencies or any unexpected expenses on an urgent basis. We created a ‘COVID Care Leaves’ policy several months ago, where an employee can take up to 28 calendar days of paid leave for self-care and healing.

War for talent is one of the key themes characterising 2021 as the tech sector is facing a severe talent crunch for skills in digital.

But not India's largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). The company depends significantly on internal fulfilment, and, hence, supply-chain constraints is not a challenge, CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said during an earnings call. And this, even as the company saw total contracts worth $9.2 billion in Q4 FY21 -- an all-time high.

With over a 10 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in revenues at $5.989 billion, the company has closed the year on a strong note. TCS added over 40,000 employees in FY21 and 19,388 between January and March 2021, the highest ever in a quarter.

Why are we talking about war for talent?

Demand for technology professionals has far outstripped the supply as enterprises across the world invest in technology. Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities in a note said that the IT industry might need to hire 400,000 to meet the growth expectations.

However, there is only a limited talent pool with digital skills, which are in demand. This is what is resulting in the war for talent as companies struggle to hire quality talent and are now forced to pay a premium for the same.

But TCS’ statement is in contrast to sentiments from other industry executives, some of whom have pointed out that talent is one of the key challenges, given the increasing demand and limited pool available for the niche skill.

Where does TCS’ confidence stem from? There are a couple of factors.

Emphasis on build

TCS is one of the largest campus recruiters. It hired 40,000 in FY21. In an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol, V Ramakrishnan, CFO, said that the company will hire 40,000 more from campuses in FY22 as well.

Its peer Infosys hired 16,500 last year and will hire 24,000 in FY22, said UB Pravin Rao, COO. HCL Tech plans to hire 12,000 this fiscal. Wipro does not disclose fresher hiring plans but reports suggest that the company planned to hire 12,000 in FY21.

Given the large fresher intake, over the last few years, TCS has invested heavily in training and development initiatives to keep talent and technology ready in a short time. This includes cutting down classroom training for freshers and deploying them faster on projects after they are on-boarded.

One such initiative to cut down classroom training time is through the platform FrescoPlay, which uses analytics to design individual-focused training programmes. According to a BusinessLine report, the company has been able to cut down classroom training, which lasts a few months, by as much as 80 percent.

According to sources Moneycontrol spoke to, the idea is to have ready-to-be-deployed freshers. Between recruiting and on-boarding, there is a gap of a few months. Now IT firms are looking to utilise that time to train candidates before on-boarding them.

However, it does not stop there. Once these freshers are deployed in projects, new recruits and employees continue their upskilling journey. These employees’ skills are measured using the T Factor score, which is a combination of domain and technology expertise.

A senior company executive pointed out that these initiatives have helped in improving the internal fulfilment rate even as demand increased over the last few months.

National Qualifier Test (NQT)

NQT is an assessment platform designed by TCS iON to measure candidates’ cognitive ability, and skill expertise. People who are in their final and pre-final year and up to two years of work experience can apply for the test. Apart from Tata group companies like TCS and Titan, other firms such as Happiest Minds use NQT for hiring.

According to industry experts, NQT will also aid in bridging talent gap. “Through NQT, TCS has a huge database for candidates. Whenever a need arises, TCS can extend offers to candidates who have taken the test and that would, to some extent, solve the talent problem,” added experts.

Low attrition rates

TCS continues to have a low attrition rate in the industry, compared to its peers even before the pandemic.

Even before the pandemic, TCS was able to contain its attrition rate at 11.5 percent in Q1 FY20, whereas its peers reported high rates. Infosys’ was as high as 20 percent and Wipro’s and HCL Tech’s around 17 percent each.

The company reported an attrition rate of 7.2 percent for the quarter ending March 2021 and 7.6 percent for the previous quarter. Infosys posted 10 percent attrition for the quarter ending December 2020 and Wipro 11 percent. HCL Tech’s attrition stood at 11.2 percent for the quarter ending December.

CFO Ramakrishnan said during the earnings call that the attrition rate is likely to inch up with more opportunities in the market. However, higher retention of its existing workforce, compared to its peers, will also help the company address talent issues.",825,0.19348681431550246

Motilal Oswal's research report on TCS

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported revenue growth of 4.2% QoQ CC in 4QFY21 (v/s our estimate of 3.4%), delivering its third consecutive quarter of broad based (over 4% QoQ) growth. It marginally improved its EBIT margin to 26.8% (+20bp QoQ/+170bp YoY). The same was below our estimate (27.2%) on ramp up of large deals. Deal wins in 4QFY21 stood at USD9.2b, the highest in its history, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5x. A good 4Q helped it report sales (USD)/EBIT/PAT growth of 0.6%/10%/0.4% in FY21. Strong recovery from TCS, post the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, indicates continued strength in the tech spending environment, along with its ability to capture outsized market share. The management commentary on enterprise demand, especially on Cloud, implies a positive outlook for peers as well. It also highlighted a robust pipeline, with a mix of small/mid-sized deals along with a few large ones, giving it confidence on client spends.



Outlook

Our TP implies 26x FY23E EPS. While we remain positive on the company, we remain Neutral given its rich multiples.

The company's Q4 net profit at Rs 9,246 crore was 14.9 percent higher year-on-year (YoY) from Rs 8,049 crore in Q4FY20. This was, however, slightly below the market expectations as a CNBC-TV18 poll had estimated the company's profit at Rs 9,317 crore for the quarter.

""I am very pleased with our performance in Q4,"" said V Ramakrishnan, Chief Financial Officer of the company, adding, ""this caps three-quarters of consistently robust performance in a pandemic year, and gives us a strong exit from FY21.""

""Our Q4 margins are a validation of our strong belief that it is possible to win mega-deals, post-industry-leading growth, continue to invest in our people and in newer capabilities, and still deliver industry-leading profitability. All the investments that we have been making over the years position us strongly to expand our footprint in the large growth and transformation opportunity,"" said Ramakrishnan.

Here are eight top highlights of TCS' March quarter scorecard:

1. Key numbers: Owing to the ramp-up of large deals, cross-currency tailwind and recovery in demand, the March quarter ended on a healthy note for the company.

The company saw a 6.3 percent sequential growth in March quarter consolidated profit at Rs 9,246 crore.

Consolidated revenue during the quarter grew by 4 percent to Rs 43,705 crore. The revenue in dollar terms grew by 5 percent sequentially to $5,989 million.

EBIT at Rs 11,734 crore grew 4.9 percent QoQ while ENIT margin rose 20 bps QoQ to 26.8 percent.

2. All verticals log gains sequentially: The company's all verticals showed good sequential growth; however, some of them lagged on a yearly basis.

BFSI grew 7 percent QoQ and 13.3 percent YoY whereas the retail and CPG segment grew 4 percent QoQ but declined 0.9 percent YoY. Similarly, communications and media grew 1.8 percent QoQ but declined 4 percent YoY.

The rest, such as life sciences and healthcare (up 3.8 percent QoQ and 19.3 percent YoY), manufacturing (up 3.9 percent QoQ and 1.3 percent YoY) and technology and services (up 2.8 percent QoQ and 3.9 percent YoY) ended the quarter on a positive note.

On a full-year basis, life sciences and healthcare (up 17.1 percent), BFSI (up 2.4 percent) and technology and services (up 0.2 percent) showed growth while the rest continue to be below prior-year levels, TCS said.

3. Europe, North America lead market growth: All major markets showed sequential as well as yearly growth. Continental Europe (up 8.5 percent QoQ and 11.7 percent YoY) and North America (up 3.9 percent QoQ and 5.9 percent YoY) led among geographies sequentially.

UK market (up 3.4 percent QoQ and 1 percent YoY), Middle East and Africa (up 4.2 percent QoQ and 10.6 percent YoY), India (up 2.8 percent QoQ and 11.2 percent YoY), Latin America (up 2.5 percent QoQ and 1.5 percent YoY), and Asia Pacific (up 1 percent QoQ and 1.5 percent YoY), all ended well.

However, on a full-year basis, with the exception of Continental Europe which grew 5.5 percent, all other markets continue to be in negative territory compared to the prior year, TCS said.

4. Deal wins: The company entered into several strategic partnerships and deals in the March quarter of FY21. Some of them included a strategic partnership with Honeywell Inc in their supply chain processes transformation programme.

SODEXO SA, a global leader in services, selected TCS as its strategic partner for its IT@Sodexo transformation journey towards next-generation application management services.

5. Strong order book: TCS' order book at $9.2 billion in Q4FY21 was the highest-ever total contract value (TCV) in a quarter, taking the total yearly order book to $31.6 billion, a 17.1 percent growth compared to the previous financial year. Its TCV in Q3FY21 was at $6.8 billion.

6. Dividend: The board of directors recommended a final dividend of Rs 15 per share of Rs 1 each which shall be paid/dispatched on the fourth day from the conclusion of the annual general meeting.

7. Human resource: TCS added 19,388 employees to its rolls on a net basis in Q4, which was the highest-ever net addition in a quarter.

The total headcount stood at 4,88,649, a net addition of 40,185 during the year. IT services attrition rate (LTM) was at 7.2 percent.

8. Growth top agenda for FY22: On expected lines, the company's management signalled TCS will keep growth in focus by leveraging its position in the market.

""Our investments over the last decade in building newer capabilities, and in research and innovation, position us well for the multi-year technology services opportunity ahead,"" said Rajesh Gopinathan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director.

""While we continue to dominate in our traditional areas of strength, we are making good progress in gaining share in the growth and transformation opportunity. Our focus going into FY22 will be to engage with clients in their growth agenda, propelled by innovation and leverage of collective knowledge,"" he said.

In a separate BSE filing, the company announced the appointment of Samir Seksaria as Chief Financial Officer, effective May 1, 2021, to take over from Ramakrishnan V, who would be retiring from the company effective April 30, 2021.",883,0.8184220005165447

India's largest IT services firm TCS added over 40,000 employees in FY21 and 19,388 between January and March 2021, highest ever in a quarter.

The company has also reported an all-time low attrition rate of 7.2 percent. The IT services major will hire 40,000 freshers in FY22, same as that of FY21. Total employee count at the end of the year stood at 488,649.

With over 10 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in revenues at $5.989 billion, the company has closed the year on a strong note.

The company signed deals worth $9.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up 35 percent from the $6.8 billion in deals in Q3 FY21. This is the highest-ever total contract value the company reported in a quarter.

Last two quarters have seen demand return with the company signing large deals. Three key deals signed in the fourth quarter include Vodafone Ziggo, BankservAfrica, and Three UK, according to brokerage firm Investec.

However, this means increased demand for skills for execution of these projects.

Top IT and tech firms have hundreds of positions open with Accenture alone reporting over 18,000 job openings across the service lines. Skills that are in most demand include full stack developer, machine learning, and data analytics.

In an interaction with Moneycontrol in January, CFO V Ramakrishnan said that the company will hire about 40,000 employees in FY22, similar to last year.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

“Our continued technology investments will simplify our IT estate and create the platforms and services necessary to meet the future needs of our members. The partnership with TCS will help us meet these challenges while prioritising the security and resilience our members expect

When COVID-19 struck early last year, Infosys was able to make its 2.4 lakh employees spread across 40 countries work from home in days. This feat was possible because the software major has been working towards becoming as nimble as a startup, according to a new book.

The book titled Live Enterprise captures the learnings of the IT services company from its journey in the past three years.

Authored by Infosys Knowledge Institute head Jeff Kavanaugh and CTO for its strategic technology group Rafee Tarafdar, the book contains lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, Infosys' response for its customers and over 2.4 lakh employees, plus the work of its Foundations in multiple countries around the world.

Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani, launching the book, said Live Enterprise is an idea of how firms will be run in the future. “A lot of it has come out of our own experience at Infosys. In the last three years, Infosys has been on a major drive to reinvent and make itself more agile. We have taken this experience to over 1,000 clients around the world and this combined knowledge has all been distilled in this book, which is a guidepost on anyone looking at a digital journey,"" said Nilekani, the architect of the Aadhaar Unique ID programme.

At the launch, Nilekani revealed details about how Infosys tackled the pandemic. "" While we had digital infrastructure for remote working, this was designed for 10 percent of our employees, who were working from home. So, it was simply a question of scaling from 10 percent to 100 percent in a matter of days,"" he said.

Tarafdar said the authors wanted to share as many learnings and best practices as possible. ""While the vision can be big, you can start small and rapidly innovate and experiment from it.

Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) has given its contract for the implementation of the Commodity Derivatives Platform (CDP) to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). The MCX board met on February 5 and announced its new technology partner.

This is the first time that MCX is changing its technology partner. Currently, 63 Moons Technologies, (formerly FTIL) which was the founder-promoter of MCX, is providing technology for the clearing and settlement software at MCX.

A source close to the development told Moneycontrol: “TCS was the lowest bidder in the bidding process which was initiated in October last year. The company has the expertise and has been expanding its software suite with the acquisition of Postbank Systems AG, the technology services unit of Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG.”

A 63 Moons spokesperson has told Moneycontrol that the company is not aware of any such development.

“However, if it is true, we can only quote from the Bible: ‘God please forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing’. This is akin to changing the engine of a supersonic plane while it is flying seamlessly at 50,000 feet over sea level. 63 Moons is the only company in the exchange technology space, which has got 24-carat operational track record for 16 hours a day, right from the inception of MCX, and in fact, it is the wind beneath the MCX wings of stability till September 2022,” the spokesperson added.

MCX has been the biggest client of 63 Moons Technologies for exchange technology product and services. The development is likely to be a blow to 63 Moons Technologies as MCX is its only remunerative exchange client. Its other client, the Metropolitan Stock Exchange (MSE), has been on a revival mode after struggling in the past.

The present MCX-63 Moons agreement will come to a close in 2022, by which time MCX will now have to migrate to the CDP implemented by TCS. It remains to be seen how MCX and 63 Moons manage their relationship until 2022 to ensure that the migration is smooth.

The loss of MCX account has put a question mark on the future of 63 Moons’ Exchange Technology as it has not found any new client in the past several years. Post-2022, the company’s revenues and profitability may be affected and it may find it tough to maintain its development and support team.",398,-0.33278260628382367

The survey noted that the recent policy relaxations related to work from home would further help the sector grow in the coming years.

“In 2021, a number of significant structural reforms have been undertaken to drive innovation, technology adoption and efficiency in the IT-BPM sector, including Relaxation of OSP Terms. This would significantly expand access to talent, increase job creation, make India a global hub for digital services and catapult the sector to the next level of growth and innovation,” according to the survey.

Relaxation of the OSP (Other Service Provider) licence would significantly reduce the regulatory compliance on the business process management companies thereby facilitating work from home for thousands of employees.

The sector employs about 50 lakh people.

IT BPM executives shared that the relaxation would help the industry help the companies access talent in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. This will also aid in accessing the talent pool such as retired people with domain knowledge, women and physically challenged people, who can work remotely for few hours.

IT and the COVID-19 pandemic

The IT sector was one of the biggest gainers during the pandemic. Stock prices of large and mid-tier IT companies doubled since April 2020. It was also one of the first sectors to see the demand recover. This was in part driven by the accelerated adoption of technology amid the pandemic.

For major enterprises, technology adoption was imminent to ensure business continuity and that was reflected in the large deals IT majors signed over the last two quarters.

The company’s brand value stood at $14,924 million in 2021 as opposed to $13,499 million in 2020.

According to the Brand Finance report, the growth on brand value of $1.4 billion is the highest absolute growth among the 25 firms assessed in the IT services space. “…that too in a challenging year when the brand value of IT services companies collectively dropped by 3 percent. Further, at 10 percent growth over the prior year, TCS has outperformed its peers in the Top 3 category,” the report said.

The world’s leading brand valuation firm also ranked TCS at the third position among the top 25 IT companies globally.

Though the report did not explicitly list the brands that occupied the first two places, firms in IT services space that have a higher brand value than TCS were US-based IBM at $27,428 million and Accenture at $26,028 million. IBM also has a huge focus on cloud through its Red Hat acquisition.

In addition, TCS Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan was ranked fifth in the Brand Guardianship Index 2021, which lists the top 100 CEO globally. Mukesh Ambani followed him taking the sixth position, while Ajay Banga of Mastercard topped the list. Salil Parekh, CEO, Infosys was ranked at the 17th spot.

“With what was a very tough 2020, led so ably by its CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, TCS has excelled itself once again. Along with 10 percent growth in its brand, its market cap also hit pole position in its industry and it is increasingly closing in on the top two in the IT services sector table,"" said David Haigh, Chief Executive Officer, Brand Finance, in a statement.

According to the report, this was possible because of the company’s ability to quickly adapt to new ways of working through the launch of its Secure Borderless Workspaces, its remote working platform and its robust financial, customer and market performance amid the pandemic.

Onn January 25, 2021, the company became the most valuable IT firm in the world in market capitalisation surpassing Accenture. In the process, it also became the most valuable Indian firm in the country, overtaking Reliance Industries.

Apart from TCS, the other key brands that featured in the Brand Finance report under Global 500 include Accenture (ranked 60). Bengaluru-based Infosys was ranked at 212 in brand value at $8,402 million, up 18.6 percent from $7,087 million last year. Cognizant’s brand value dipped from the rank of 219 in 2020 to 231. Other Indian IT firms HCL was ranked 353, up from 425 in 2020 and Wipro’s rank rose to 457 in 2021 from 493 last year.

Indian IT majors Infosys and TCS on Monday joined global giants like Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Bank of America in an international coalition launched by the World Economic Forum to tackle racism in workplaces.

Announcing the coalition during its week-long online Davos Agenda Summit, the WEF said it would work towards improving racial and ethnic justice in the workplace.

The founding members include 48 organizations representing 13 industries, with more than 55 lakh employees worldwide and with headquarters in three continents, the WEF said.

It further said companies must put racial and ethnic justice on their board's agendas, take at least one firm action and set a long-term strategy to become an anti-racist organization and build equitable and just workplaces for professionals with under-represented racial and ethnic identities.

Examples of business commitments towards racial and ethnic justice range from allocating financial and human resources to racial justice work, setting representation goals for all seniority levels, and establishing mentorship programmes for racially and ethnically diverse employees. One of the initiative's starting points will be Black inclusion and addressing anti-Blackness.

""With just 1 percent of Fortune 500 companies led by Black chief executives, the need to tackle racial under-representation in business is urgent and obvious,"" WEF Managing Director Saadia Zahidi said.

The founding members of the coalition also include AP Moller-Maersk, AlixPartners, AstraZeneca, BlackRock, Bloomberg, Boston Consulting Group, Bridgewater Associates, Centene, Cisco, Cognizant, Dentsu International, Deutsche Bank, EY, H&M, Henry Schein, HP and IKEA.

Other members are Jacobs Engineering Group, Jefferson Health, Johnson & Johnson, Kaiser Permanente, Kearney, LinkedIn, ManpowerGroup, Mastercard, Mayo Clinic, McKinsey, Nestle, PayPal, Procter & Gamble, PwC, Salesforce, SAP, Standard Chartered Bank, Coca-Cola, Depository Trust & Clearing (DTCC), Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uber, Unilever, UPS and Willis Towers Watson.

The WEF said the COVID-19 pandemic continues to widen inequalities, with disproportionate repercussions for disadvantaged groups and minorities.

At the ongoing summit global leaders will discuss what policies, practices and partnerships are needed to embed equity and inclusion into our economic systems.",343,0.014831632375717163

US President Joe Biden on January 20 signed immigration bill that would reverse Donald Trump’s protectionist immigration policies.

One of the provisions of the bill was to provide US citizenship to 11 million undocumented immigrants, including 500,000 from India, in an eight-year time frame. But there was more in store for H-1B workers and students who would like to pursue education in the US as well.

What did the bill address?

Clearing green card backlogs for employment based category.

“This bill clears employment-based visa backlogs, recaptures unused visas, reduces lengthy wait times, and eliminates per-country visa caps,” according to a statement that detailed the immigration reform. The bill will also improve access to green cards for workers in lower-wage sectors and eliminate other unnecessary hurdles for employment-based green cards, the statement added.

This would help Indians on H-1B visa, who are waiting to get their hands on green card for a long time. There are about 8 lakh Indians on employment visas like H-1B visa in the green card queue, a large number of whom have been waiting to get their hands on the coveted green cards for more than a decade.

Work authorisation of H-4 visa holders, dependents of H-1B

The bill provides dependents of H-1B visa holders work authorization, which was first introduced when Barack Obama was the President in 2015. This benefited a large number of Indians, who accounted for about 1.06 lakh of H-4 visas as of FY19. This would continue, bringing relief to thousands of Indians in the US.

Students

“The bill makes it easier for graduates of US universities with advanced STEM degrees to stay in the US,” the statement read.

This is good news for students who would like to stay back in the US under Optional Practical Training (OPT), a gateway to get H-1B visa in the US. The Trump administration wanted to remove OPT programme, which allows foreign STEM graduates to work in the US for three years temporarily.

Final Rules

Over the last few weeks, in a last-ditch attempt to push its immigration agenda, the Trump administration passed three final rules that would impact H-1B visa workers. These would impact Indian techies and IT firms, who are one of the largest beneficiaries of the visa.

This included H-1B selection based on wages instead of lottery, wage hikes for H-1B employees and mandate to initiate H-1B visa from both employers and clients.

Of the three rules, mandate to initiate H-1B visa from both employers and clients is unlikely to be implemented as it was never published in the Federal register. The other two rules will not come into effect immediately and could see a delay as agencies review these rules.

The executive order signed on January 20, 2021 read, “… the heads of agencies shall promptly take steps to rescind any orders, rules, regulations, guidelines, or policies, or portions thereof, implementing or enforcing the Executive Orders… as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, including the Administrative Procedure Act.”

“If in any case such rescission cannot be finalized immediately, the Director and the heads of agencies shall promptly take steps to provide all available exemptions authorized by any such orders, rules, regulations, guidelines, or policies, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,” the order read.

What does it mean for Indians and IT firms?

They can be relieved as the bill address issues related to STEM talent and has put on hold rules that would impact the H-1B visas.

Indian IT industry body NASSCOM said in a statement, “President Biden has pledged a new approach on Trade and Immigration, as well as a renewed and revitalized interest in Science and Technology. We appreciate President Biden’s commitment to review and make necessary changes to harmful regulatory policies put in place by the outgoing Administration.”

Most IT firms initiate H-1B visas for their employees to work for their clients in the US. So far, clients did not have to take part in the H-1B application process. The new rule intend to changes that. With the rule yet to be published in the Federal register, this will not come into effect.

It is yet to be seen what would happen to the wage-based rules as they can be challenged in courts or could be revoked by the Biden administration.

V Ramakrishnan, CFO, TCS, in an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol on January 11 referring to H-1B selection based on wages, said, “We don’t know even if these changes will survive. Some of the changes that happened they were successfully legally challenged.”

“Having said that our own dependency on these has come down significantly. So while these may create disruptions, these are part of the business model and we will be able to handle it whichever way the changes happen,” he added.",805,0.9049061894416809

Noida-based IT services firm HCL Technologies, which broke into the $10 billion revenue club for the year ending December 2020, expects the growth momentum to continue as it is looking at multi-year technology upcycle, said Prateek Aggarwal, Chief Financial Officer (CFO).

For the year ending December, its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services' (TCS) revenue stands at $21.6 billion and Infosys’ at $13 billion. Wipro’s revenue for the calendar year 2020 was close to $8 billion.

In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Aggarwal said this growth came at the back of digital transformation of businesses, and cost optimisation projects like vendor consolidation as clients are looking to cut down cost at the back of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“So, I definitely see it as a multi-year cycle,” he said.

Aggarwal said that at the back of the pandemic, enterprises across the board are accelerating their technology adoption and this process will take years to be completely digital.

According to Aggarwal, given the size of IT landscape that most of its customers have, be it Fortune500 companies in the US, it will take years to change to digital technologies like cloud migration or to be nimbler to serve their customers better.

“I see it at least a 3-5 year kind of technology upcycle. As far as HCL is concerned we have invested quite in advance,” he added. This includes investment in its Mode 2 and Mode 3, which are digital technologies and products and platforms, over the last few years.

“They are starting to bear fruit. It propelled us to become a $10 billion company now,” he added.

This is already reflecting in the deals the company has signed. The company has signed 13 digital transformation deals in the quarter. C Vijayakumar, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), said the overall deal pipeline is 20 percent more than what it was in the December 2019 quarter.

The company has also increased its revenue guidance for FY21 to 2-3 percent from 1.5-2.5 percent earlier. The company registered a growth of $2,617 million, up 2.9 percent for the quarter ending December 2020. Its profits increased 26.5 percent YoY to $540 million in the same quarter.

This was in part due to the company’s Mode 2 and Mode 3 business, which were one of the fastest growing segments for the company and are a key growth driver. Mode 2 grew 25 percent YoY and Mode 3, which includes its products and platforms, saw 3.5 percent growth. This is likely to continue as well.

The company is also ramping up its hiring. The company added 4,022 freshers in the quarter and in total HCL Tech has on-boarded 6,480 employees so far. The company will add 5,000 more for the quarter ending March 2021. For the quarter, the net addition of employees stood at 6,597.

Through its training and reskilling programme, the company has been able to fulfill the demand internally. The company’s internal fulfilment rate has increased by 10 percent in the quarter to 60 percent. “This is also one of the reasons that has our growth,” VV Apparao, Chief Human Resources Officer, told media persons during the earnings call.",532,0.9970959722995758

Big Indian IT companies such as Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys have won large deals or acquired units in the region as local businesses looked to “quickly transform” to adjust to the pandemic situation, The Economic Times reported.

Among countries, the majority of these new “mega-deals”, the report said, took place in Germany – this is in large part because companies in the country have never outsourced to this extent before and the current situation has made it “lucrative to gain a foothold in the German market” for Indian IT companies, HfS Research CEO Phil Fersht said.

Analysts in general told the paper that similar deals and acquisitions are likely to continue and there may be bigger moves in the region.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

It expects consensus to revise their revenue growth estimates, as deal wins across the pack are very strong and European geography will outperform in coming quarters.

Faqir Chand Kohli, father of the Indian IT industry, passed away on Thursday. Born in 1924 in Peshawar, Kohli lived to the ripe old age of 96. He leaves behind a tall, and unmatched, legacy in the information technology business.

After completing his Bachelor of Science (BSc) from the University of Punjab, Lahore in then-undivided India, Kohli won a scholarship to Queen's University, Canada where he did BSc (Honors) in Electrical Engineering in 1948. He followed this up with a Masters in Electrical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1950.

Kohli joined Tata Electric in 1951, and later the fledgling Tata Consultancy Services in 1969, apparently with some prodding by JRD Tata. Former TCS CEO S. Ramadorai reveals in his book that Kohli was initially reluctant to head what is now the world's most valuable IT firm.

Joining TCS

When TCS was created in 1968, PM Agarwala took over as its Director. He was then the Managing Director of Tata Electric earlier, where Kohli was employed for nearly two decades.

In his book 'TCS Story and Beyond', Ramadorai states Agarwala chose Kohli, who was then the Deputy General Manager at Tata Electric. The book narrates how Kohli came to be a part of TCS.

TCS was based in Nirmal building at Nariman Point, Mumbai. Though the team at TCS was talented, cash flow was a concern. Agarwala then realised that “he needed a strong hand at the top – a headmaster figure – to bring in the order,” Ramadorai notes.

In the mid-1960s, Kohli had used mainframe technology to successfully design computer systems to control the power lines between Mumbai and Pune. This was one of the key reasons why Kohli was prevailed upon -- because he was reluctant to leave Tata Electric -- to join TCS as the general manager in 1969, a post that was created for him, Ramadorai noted in his book.

The book by Ramadorai and interaction with executives, who know Kohli, offers more insights into how Kohli led the way for TCS and, in turn, the Indian IT industry.

For instance, it took Kohli six months to adjust to the environment, during which time he read technical books to gain knowledge of the subject, since he was an electrical engineer. Something that earned him respect from his subordinates.

At a time when computer prices were exorbitant and knowledge of it even less, Kohli had a tough job ahead. For then it was not clear what lay on the road ahead for TCS -- which was more or less a startup -- and the nascent IT market.

Transforming IT sector

One of the first things Kohli did was pivot the company to management consulting from its data processing. Through that, the company was able to get its clients to go beyond data processing.

TCS, in an email yesterday, said, ""...over the next two decades, (he then led the company) into software development, helping the organization navigate multiple technology waves over two and a half decades by continually investing in people and staying relevant to customers.""

Talent, evidently, was one of the key focus areas for the company. He groomed leaders in TCS who then went on to take larger roles including N Chandrasekaran, chairman, Tata Sons, and Ramadorai, who went on to became CEO of TCS.

Kohli recruited engineering talent from premier institutions like IITs, at a time when there were no separate IT departments. For Kohli was convinced, Ramadorai says in the book, that bright young talent was needed to use computers. Indian IT firms are one of the largest recruiters in the Indian engineering colleges till date.

But just merely having a skilled workforce was not enough. Because it was still largely leveraging its parent company’s extended network for revenues. However, the scenario changed after 1973 when the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act came into the picture.

In 1974 Kohli had assumed the role of Director in Charge for TCS and was in a position to drive the TCS vision, notes Ramadorai.

This was a key turning point for TCS. When many companies including IBM left the country, Kohli was instrumental in forming a joint venture (JV) with Burroughs, one of the three mainframe markers at that time. This made it possible for the company to import machines to India but a lot of red tape still had to be dealt with.

Sangeeta Gupta, senior vice president, NASSCOM, pointed out that starting out early would mean working with the government to get the licenses, which would have been a huge challenge - and it was. Kohli managed it to ensure that the JV was possible.

This marked the beginning of what is now called the outsourcing model. TCS became the first company to do so. Through the JV, Burroughs was not only supplying the computers but also wanted TCS programmers to help its US and European clients to migrate to their system from that of their rival's.

The development work was done in India and was implemented at the client location overseas. The developed work would be copied in disks and was sent to the US to their colleagues, who then implemented it.

This business model that was started by Kohli, points out Hexaware founder Atul Nishar, continues to be the core of the IT industry today.

Another key change was targeting the US. After cutting the ties with Burroughs (a new JV was formed between Tata and Burroughs and TCS came out of it) in the late 1970s, TCS set up its first overseas unit in New York to tap into the opportunities to build its revenue stream.

Kohli made Ramadorai the Resident Manager there in 1979 to drive the business. This started the onsite/offshore model where TCS engineers worked during the day and their US counterparts resumed the work in their morning.

The model stayed and the US continues to be the largest revenue generator for IT firms, accounting for about 50-60 percent of the revenues for the top ones.

Nishar pointed out that maintaining relationships with clients and building trust was important for Kohli and he always kept his word to clients. This was imbibed by the industry as well.

Many of the initiatives that Kohli introduced became the bedrock for the IT industry, which was probably what earned him the name the “father of the IT industry”. Kohli was also awarded a Padma Bhushan in 2002 for his contribution to India's IT industry.

The success of the $200 billion industry, Gupta from NASSCOM, and Nishar pointed out, is thanks to the confidence he helped instill not only for TCS but also the entire industry and that spawned leaders.

Beyond TCS

After his successful stint at TCS, Kohli stepped down from the role of CEO in 1996, and Ramadorai was chosen as his successor.

Even after his retirement in 1999 from the company at the age of 75, Kohli continued to play an active role in the industry. With his passion for technology, Kohli always engaged with government committees and was a part of Nasscom. “He just kept handing out the message that we need to think beyond the success of the Indian IT industry,” said Gupta.

Gupta remembers that at one meeting, when everyone was discussing what was next for global markets, he asked them to take a step back and focus on technology in India. “Focus on local language computing, a world-class hardware sector, R&D in partnership with academics if you want Indian industry to be powerful globally,” she recalls him saying.

In 2016, former Tata group insider Cyrus Mistry alleged that Ratan Tata tried to sell TCS to IBM while Kohli was unwell to due to a medical condition.

In a clarification to Mistry’s allegations, Kohli said in a statement, “Mr Cyrus Mistry’s comments regarding the sale of TCS to IBM at some “unspecified point in time” are not correct. I was actively involved in the decision to bring IBM to India. A JV for hardware manufacturing and support in India, Tata IBM, was set up in 1991-92. This JV was undertaken to promote a computer hardware industry in India which was non-existent at that time.”

He further clarified that his “bypass surgery” happened in 1984 in the US.

Zest for life

Even well into his 90s, Kohli was as fit as they come and a lifelong learner. “He never believed in retiring. At this age he still went to the office for four hours a day,” said Nishar. But, more importantly, he loved to be with people and engage with them.

In 2019, Kohli and his wife were part of the Nasscom retreat in Varanasi. He was 95 then. “He would not accept any support and participated in all the events,” he said. Gupta recalled that he would stay engaged in business discussions and also in all the fun activities.

During a visit to Pakistan years ago by a Nasscom team as part of a larger business delegation, Gupta was struck by how sprightly Kohli was during a visit to Taxila. “At that age if you can still have that zest for life, move without support or a wheelchair... I think that is something I would love for myself,” said Gupta.

His daily walk along Mumbai’s Marine Drive, a habit of decades, says Nishar, no doubt helped him stay fit.

Mourned by IT industry

Kohli’s demise was mourned by all in the IT industry, but particularly by those in the Tata group.

Tata Sons chairman Chandrasekaran in a emailed statement, said, “…He was a true legend, who laid the very foundations for India’s spectacular IT revolution and set the stage for the dynamic modern economy we enjoy today. I have had the honor and privilege of working with and learning from Mr. Kohli from the day he hired me as a trainee in TCS.""

Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO, TCS, said in an emailed statement, “….We continue to draw inspiration from Mr Kohli’s passion for technology, intellectual rigor, community spirit and his relentless drive until the very end.”

Kohli will be missed by all who knew him in the IT industry and beyond, and his passing is bound to leave a void that is hard to fill.",1730,0.2598598370185265

Ask those who knew him well and they would remember Faqir Chand Kohli, the first Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), as the father of the Indian IT industry.

Kohli, who last spoke to Moneycontrol in October, passed away on November 26 of natural causes. He is survived by his wife and three children.

""Mr. Faqir Kohli formed and led TCS from its founding days. He guided the company in its early years and defined the vision for its growth,"" said Tata group patriarch and Chairman Emeritus Ratan N Tata.

""His early vision played an important role in creating the outstandingly successful global IT company that TCS has become today,"" Tata added.

Tata also said: ""Kohli's contribution in various technology-oriented areas was significant. and he will be remembered as one of the fathers of India’s successful IT industry.""

He was gracious, unassuming, and always willing to help, Tata noted.

Other senior Tata leaders echo those views. “Kohli was a brilliant technocrat and a business leader with varied interests. He was passionate about the development of our nation and its youth,” said former CEO and Vice Chairman of TCS S Ramadorai, who took over after Kohli retired.

Kohli, who was 96 years old, ran TCS more like a promoter, which was to mean that it was his own company and that he never allowed resources to be wasted just because it could be put on the corporate balance sheet, said management consultant Hiru Bijlani, who was a long-time friend of the Kohlis.

“He made very sure he ran a tight ship,” Bijlani said, adding that Kohli had a “tough-love” management style and pushed through more barriers for Indian IT than people are aware of.

That’s something that even Ramadorai recalls experiencing. “He always challenged me by presenting me with different situations and new opportunities in our early days. This was something I learned from him and imbibed as I grew to build my teams at TCS later,” Ramadorai said.

“I will forever cherish the opportunity to have worked with a stalwart like him,” he added.

Kohli was roped in from the Tata Electric Companies, and was instrumental in the decision to bring IBM to India as part of Tata-IBM in 1991. His role in setting up TCS and running it later is well documented.

He became the director of the company in 1970 and was appointed as the first CEO of TCS later. He retired in 1999 at the age of 75 by which time the profits of TCS were as much as if not more than most of the other group companies, Bijlani said.

Kohli, who had a green thumb and spent time in his garden in Alibaugh, was also a frequent golfer. He shot to an 18-handicap and hit a long ball even at the age of 80, and applied the same approach to work. “His work continued well after he retired, with pursuits that included educating the less fortunate through word recognition programmes and by pushing for more recognition for engineering programmes and the industry in India,” Bijlani said.

In his free time, Kohli would continue to read up on the latest developments in technology and engineering and admitted in earlier interviews that most of it was “very technical”.

Both the career highs that he cherished had to do with recognition from professional bodies. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE, which was a professional association for electronic engineering and electrical engineering with its corporate office in New York City, honoured Kohli with a fellowship, making him at the time the only non-American in the world to get it.

The other accomplishment he regarded highly was becoming a member and fellow of the South East Asia Computer Society and was the only non-Singaporean to get it.

Voltas's former Managing Director Nawshir Khurody, who knew him in his early career, said: ""Whenever I reached him for help as a young TAS officer, Kohli would set aside everything and reach out to help him. His passing has brought back memories of how few people like him are left in the Tata group. He was a humble genius and a very remarkable man.”

Khurody remembered how at the breakfast table in Pune at the Tata Management Training Centre, Kohli took the toast rack at breakfast, handed it to him, and said ""here you need it more than me"".

Kohli never cared what car he drove or what he wore or about the trappings of leadership and power. ""At the training centre, he would ask the most junior people the names of the trees and was never afraid to learn from them,"" Khurody recalled, adding that two things Kohli would tell everyone were: All software and computer work should be done in Indian languages and that India cannot become a super power until IT is extensively deployed across the country.

""We will always be reminded of the huge contribution Mr Kohli made to the Tata group. It is his vision, passion, discipline and commitment that set the culture in TCS. The grounded yet dynamic culture in TCS is a reflection of his strength of character, and I believe is what sets it apart from most of its competitors, said Cyrus Mistry, former Chairman of Tata group.

""His vision not only gave birth to TCS, but established the whole software industry in India, it is this tremendous contribution that earned him the coveted Padma Bhushan so richly deserved by him,"" he added.

A social tippler who would enjoy his single malt whiskey responsibly, Kohli was known to be direct and even ribbing friends on their dress-sense when they wore shirts that looked like table cloths.

At his home in the Air India Building at Nariman Point, guests were welcomed to warm hospitable entertainment with either jazz music or ghazals playing in the background.

Because TCS’ first office was opposite the Air India Building, where he lived, the joke was that he walked across the road and built the TCS building. Later he went there to work out of his office right until the end before the lockdown came into effect in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“During my interactions with him, I had become a firm believer that most people rise to new challenges,” Ramadorai observed. “He was also my mentor, guide and a very close family friend, and his demise is a personal loss to our family.”

At his farewell, the Tata group organised a going away bash at the Taj Hotel in Colaba and had celebrated Indian flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia perform at the function which was attended by the top brass at the group.

“The nation has lost a true visionary and legend today,” Ramadorai said.

Faqir Chand Kohli, the founder and first CEO of Tata Consultancy Services, passed away on November 26. Kohli, often called the father of the Indian IT industry, was 96 years old.

Widely recognised as the brilliant technocrat parachuted in from the Tata Electric Companies, Kohli was actively involved in the decision to bring IBM to India as part of Tata-IBM in 1991. This was part of the joint-venture for hardware manufacturing and support in India initiative.

Referred to as 'Father of the Software Industry', FC Kohli pioneered India’s 'Technology Revolution' and helped the country build the $100 billion IT industry as first CEO of TCS.

Though after hanging his boots, Kohli worked on an adult literacy programme to teach people who have never been educated and it was reported that it did help build literacy.

""That's perhaps the biggest contribution to my own country and government in helping increase literacy. It allows people to read starting small and basically for those who have never ever read and no options and designed especially for them,"" Kohli had said to MoneyControl on October 2, 2020.

Kohli joined Tata Electric Companies in 1951 and helped set up the load despatching system to manage the system operations. Following this, he became the director of the company in 1970 and was appointed as the first CEO of TCS later. He retired in 1999 at the age of 75.

Following the demise of Kohli, industrialists have expressed their condolences:

N Chandrasekaran, Chairman, Tata Sons: ""I am deeply saddened by the news that Mr. FC Kohli passed away this afternoon. He was a true legend, who laid the very foundations for India’s spectacular IT revolution and set the stage for the dynamic modern economy we enjoy today.

On November 9, TCS announced that it would acquire its client Deutsche Bank’s IT business by 2020 end. Three days later, the company in a statement said that it would acquire staff and select assets of its client, Prudential Financial subsidiary Pramerica Systems in Ireland.

The acquisitions will strengthen India’s largest IT services company’s banking and financial services portfolio. According to analysts, the move is a bid to reignite growth in its financial services segment.

“TCS hasn’t made a significant acquisition before, so this is a major statement,” said Phil Fersht, founder, HFS Research, an analyst firm.

Indeed, unlike its global rival Accenture, and local peers such as Wipro and Infosys, which, in addition to building in-house products, make acquisitions that complement their portfolio, TCS has been building digital products and platform solutions in-house for clients. It would not be a stretch to say that the company’s robust digital portfolio has been built from scratch.

However, with its peers Infosys and Teaneck, New Jersey-based Cognizant closing in, Fersht explained, TCS needed to change its BFS playbook. He added that Wipro, under new CEO Thierry Delaporte with his proven capability in the space, poses a threat as well. Wipro recently overhauled its business units to accelerate growth.

BFS growth slump

Banking and financial services is the largest revenue generator for TCS, accounting for about a quarter of its total revenue.

From 31.1 percent in FY19, banking and financial services accounted for about 30.5 percent of its total revenue in FY20. For the last two quarters Q1 FY21 and Q2 FY21, however, the revenue contribution has risen to 31.3 percent and 31.9 percent, respectively.

During the company’s results announcement in October 2019, CEO Rajesh Gopinathan explained that BFS growth continued to slow down as large banks continue to be under pressure. During the earnings call in January 2020, the company’s third quarter, Gopinathan said that the decline in the BFS vertical continues on account of cost optimisation activities banks had undertaken in the US and UK.

Growth from the retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) vertical, which accounts for about 14.6 percent revenue, also declined in Q2 FY20.

“Financial services has been slow for all service providers as the sector has moved to take more of its functions in-house and lessen its dependence on third-party providers,” said Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO, Everest Group, an IT consultancy firm.

As financial services firms began to face stiff competition from the new-age Fintech sector, they began making their own investments in technology.

Though this slowdown impacted other IT firms as well, firms such as Infosys fared better. Infosys, whose BFS vertical accounts for about 30 percent of revenue, posted 8.6 percent y-o-y growth for the quarter ending September 2019.

Nilanjan Roy, CFO, Infosys had then said during earning calls that the company was able to capitalise on demand in the mortgage area through its acquisition Stater.

Though Covid-19 had impacted growth, in Q2 FY21, Infosys reported 3.7 percent year-on-year growth in BFS compared to the marginal decline TCS saw in the same quarter.

This is where the TCS’ acquisitions can help, say analysts. At the back of Covid-19, Bendor-Samuel said, TCS is getting rare opportunities to expand its business through carve-outs, particularly in Europe, where financial institutions are under more pressure.

“These wins are nice pickups and will strengthen TCS’ position as a leading provider of services to the financial services industry,” Bendor-Samuel added.

One-off event?

However, though these moves could potentially benefit TCS’ BFS growth, there are couple of things one need to watch out for, say analysts. Fersht said given TCS’ limited experience with M&A and its distinct culture, one needs to see how the IT major will manage these investments.

According to Bendor-Samuel, such carve-outs are likely to be a one-time event in the wake of the crisis and do not indicate that financial services firms’ dependence on third-party providers could increase.

“This (the acquisitions) will create a nice short-term boost for TCS but does not signal that the financial services sector will be a strong growth area for TCS or any of its competitors,” he added.",694,0.14136732901845658

Note to readers: How ​do corporate leaders surf life after hanging up their boots? What do they do next? What are the lessons they learned in their eventful journeys? What advice do they have for the current crop of leaders? Veterans Unpacked is a new series of interviews aimed to offer readers lessons from retired bosses on life outside the corner office.

As former CEO and Vice Chairman of the $100 billion Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), S. Ramadorai was top shot-caller in creation of the jewel in the crown of the Tata Group. He spearheaded its efforts from 1996 when TCS’s revenues were at $ 155 million and onward.

Ramadorai was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2006, the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire), by her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II for his contribution to the Indo-British economic relations in 2009, and spends time supporting the environment, educational efforts and social initiatives.

1. What have you been up to since hanging up your boots?

Ramadorai: A lot. I am involved with initiatives in Healthcare (Public Health and Hospitals), Education, Vocational Education, Climate Change, Arts and Culture. I'm also nurturing and mentoring a number of start ups. I see great potential in their ideas and their ability to scale up. I am also a voracious reader and have been using this time to expand my understanding on a number of diverse areas.

In addition to my tech and science reading, I have been reading books on Mahatma and others that includes Pawan Varma's Adi Shankaracharya and Bob Woodward's Fear. When the time allows it, I also tune into several webinars including speaking on a diverse range of topics and continue to hone my interest in music across different genres. Of course I won't start singing as I'm told by my wife who's a professional at it that if I do –– then she will stop.

2. What keeps you busy now?

Ramadorai: I have been able to devote more time to photography as I am very fond of it especially when I visit wildlife reserves. I've been fortunate enough to see some fascinating sights. When in Ranthambore, I saw a tiger, tigress and their three cubs. Similarly when I was in Kenya I saw the migration of animals from the Masai Mara which is unbelievable. I've also seen lions mate which is extremely rare.

I enjoy travel and hiking and also spend time giving back to the community through foundations and a super speciality hospital that we set up exclusively for children in Haji Ali. Other things that keep me busy include cricket as I'm on the advisory board of the Rajasthan Royals and the levels of sporting excitement there is great. As Chairman of the Axis Bank Foundation I meet with grass-roots locals across the country along with the Directors.

3. Looking back, can you tell us about three interesting events or anything that has stayed with you since?

Ramadorai: When TCS achieved billion dollar revenue in 2003, that was one of most exciting moments and a major milestone for me and its employees. We had a big birthday bash of sorts and it gave us the momentum to jump every year by doubling revenue. The second was the TCS IPO. It was the largest IPO and listed on both stock exchanges similarly and was a moment of great pride.

The third thing was my retirement bash. I had a surprise party thrown for me by my colleagues and the folks who came were my school-mates, classmates from MIT and Professor from IISc and IIT Mumbai which I didn't know about. Also, at the event my wife and Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia performed and that was very memorable. At a value-level, the three principles that have stayed with me are Tata Trusteeship, Concern for the Community and the importance of participating in community initiatives and there's a difference between the second and the third.

4. What do you miss most about the C-Suite?

Ramadorai: What I miss are the quarterly meetings with the folks from the Press. I do miss the regular meetings every week on an appointed day and time with senior leadership and team. Third, I miss the meetings with customers to whom we catered to and last but not the least what I missed most was random journeys with employees irrespective of hierarchy – in my car and the chats that would accompany them.

5. If you had to relive your corporate career again, what would you do differently?

Ramadorai: There were two ideas. One was to be an IAS officer and the other was to be a general doctor. A frog dissection changed my mind on being a doctor and my father was already a part of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service, so I proceeded with engineering.

6. What are the changes in the corporate world that you see now that are vastly different from your time?

Ramadorai: I think, over time, I have come to realize a few important things and those are that economic growth and ecological well being go hand in hand. Social good is an essential part of doing business. We must nurture more start ups and invest in technology-based companies a lot more aggressively. and also step up interdisciplinary R&D investments a lot more as a percentage of revenues.

7. Which business leader in the current crop impresses you?

Ramadorai: There are several and will therefore not name any single person as each one has their own set of strengths and also have areas for improvement. People who are not shy of learning make good leaders. Empathy is also important as is the ability to course-correct when drifting which is easier said than done.

8. How did you plan for life after retirement?

Ramadorai: I was very clear about how I was going to plan retirement. I began thinking about this process two years before my actual retirement date. I was sure that I was going to transition from working in the Corporate world to working on Social initiatives. I wanted to devote my time to mentoring young minds and start-ups in new areas of engineering ,technology and for myself make the time to relearn newer aspects of technology and science . I was also clear that I would reduce my travel and only do so when necessary. Spending quality time with family and friends was going to be my priority. My golf certainly improved after retirement.

9. Is there anything you would tell your younger self?

Ramadorai: There are a couple of things I’d certainly like to tell my younger self which are listen carefully, view holistically, have a curious mind, act fearlessly, follow your passion and respect everyone. Other than that I should have visited more game reserves and climbed more mountains when younger, with the family.

10. What is your advice for the next cadre of corporate leaders?



My advice would be have other interests during college and don’t drop anything because of time. I don't buy that they have no time. Follow your passion three years in advance. Otherwise, look beyond the quarter, create a sustainable organization. What you leave behind is more important and so is sustainability – from all angles. Don’t worry about mistakes, accept, own and learn from them.And as a technology leader my advice is never go for holidays with IT folks or all you will hear them talking about is TCS, Oracle,SAP and other tech jargon.

Marking the positive beginning of Samvat 2077, Indian equities logged healthy gains on the occasion of Muhurat trading on Diwali 2020 as traders bought select heavyweights, including HDFC twins, Infosys, TCS, and Reliance Industries.

Muhurat trading is a symbolic trading session which the stock exchanges hold on the occasion of Diwali every year.

This customary one-hour trading session, mostly in the evening, is considered auspicious and marks the beginning of the new Samvat which is Hindu accounting year.

After touching a record high in opening deals, the benchmarks remained in the green for the complete one-hour session.

The Sensex hit the record high of 43,830.93 and Nifty scaled the new peak of 12,828.70 during the Muhurat trading session.

Eventually, Sensex closed 195 points, or 45 percent, higher at 43,637.98, while the Nifty settled with a gain of 60 points, or 0.47 percent, at 12,780.25.

BSE MidCap and SmallCap indices closed 0.62 percent and 0.84 percent higher, respectively.

All the sectoral indices ended in the green with Oil & Gas and Telecom gaining over a percent each.

The market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms rose to Rs 169.32 lakh crore on November 14 from Rs 168.33 lakh crore in the previous session on November 13.

While Samvat 2076 was quite volatile for the market, the new Samvat is expected to augur well for equities.

Analysts and brokerage firms are bullish on market prospects as events such as the US election is over and positive reports on the vaccine front are giving hopes that soon COVID-19 will be under control.

Improving macroeconomic indicators are also signalling bulls will have enough fodder for jumping higher.

""We have a long bull market ahead. There may be corrections to keep the valuations healthy but these corrections should be bought,"" said market veteran Madhu Kela in an interview with CNBC-TV18 on November 14.

""Too many things are coming for a good market ahead. If you look at what all is done apart from liquidity, with these kinds of low-interest rates companies are benefitting,"" said Kela.

""What the government has done in the last six months, including the labour and agriculture reforms and PLI scheme, makes me believe that we have a long way to go for this market,"" he said.

Kela said he is focussing on stocks that are neglected and likely to get benefitted from recent government measures.

""I would look at more on neglected sectors, more on the manufacturing side and sectors that will benefit from the Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme and PLI scheme,"" Kela said.

The markets have fully recovered the losses and with the US elections uncertainty behind, Samvat 2077 looks promising for the emerging markets, said Naveen Kulkarni, Chief Investment Officer at Axis Securities.

""Nifty by next Diwali can touch 14,000. Markets have discounted FY22 earnings already and if earnings visibility improves, 2023 earnings will start getting factored. So, for FY23 Nifty earnings could easily cross Rs 700 and in that scenario a 14.000 on the Nifty index looks very likely,"" Kulkarni said.

Global brokerage house Goldman Sachs has upgraded India to 'overweight' and raised the Nifty's 2021-end target to 14,100.

Goldman Sachs is of the view that the market has moved higher as investors gained confidence in improving economic momentum.

Global brokerage firm Nomura is of the view that the Nifty may hit the level of 13,640 by December 2021.

Nomura is of the view that the improvement in sentiment around the pandemic and improving high-frequency growth indicators and corporate earnings as the economy opens up could lead to market overlooking potential growth concerns that can emerge over time.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

India’s largest IT services provider TCS will complete the acquisition of Postbank Systems AG, a technology unit of Deutsche Bank AG, by the ned of 2020.

The transaction is subject to customary regulatory and governmental approvals.

Postbank Systems is the full-range captive IT service provider that provides project management, application management, and infrastructure support services to Postbank and other subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank. The captive has close to 1,500 employees and post the acquisition they will become a part of TCS.

“This will further add to TCS’s scale in Germany and strengthen its growth outlook,” the company said in a statement.

TCS did not disclose the value of the acquisition. In the statement to BSE, it said estimated value at a symbolic 1 euro.

According to a reports, this acquisition is a part of the Deutsche Bank AG’s CEO Christian Sewing's restructuring exercise where it is looking to cut 18,000 jobs or 20 percent of its workforce.

“We are pleased to deepen our long-standing partnership with Deutsche Bank, continue to help accelerate their digital transformation, and to acquire market specific capabilities in the banking domain,” NG Subramaniam, Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director, TCS, said in the statement.

“As part of our move to one technology organisation, we are consolidating the IT platform for our retail banking brand Postbank into the Deutsche Bank platform,” Bernd Leukert, Chief Technology, Data and Innovation Officer, Deutsche Bank, said in the statement.

In 2008, TCS had acquired Citigroup’s captive for $512 million along with its close to 12,000 employees. Through the acquisition, the company got banking and financial services domain knowledge. It is one of the company's largest acquisition.

Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group’s exit plan from Tata Sons, if approved, would likely bring in a tax windfall for the Centre.

Experts say that current laws in relation to capital reduction and fair value of assets, require the recipient (SP Group) to pay charge on deemed dividend (to the extent of distributing free reserves) and capital gains tax (on assets over and above free reserves) to the Centre, Business Standard reported.

The Mistrys have 18.4 percent stake (worth Rs 1.78 lakh crore) in Tata Sons, which as of March 2020 had free reserves of Rs 45,545 crore. The tax would thus be hefty, requiring the Mistrys to sell shares in listed Tata group companies to build the amount.

Ketan Dalal, Managing Partner at Katalyst Advisors LLP told the paper that the capital reduction would likely be conducted under the Companies Act by a National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

“Tax would depend on 'methodology of the payment, such as payment in cash against payment in kind or a combination of both… the general provisions of tax laws applicable to capital reduction, the recipient would be chargeable to deemed dividend (to the extent of the distributing company's free reserves) and in relation to the fair value of assets over and above such free reserves, there would be capital gains. This seems unfair because there is no monetisation at that stage,"" he added.

SP Group submitted a plan of separation to the Supreme Court on October 29, seeking non-cash settlement in form of shares in all listed Tata entities where Tata Sons owns stake – basis pro rata split of listed assets (per known share price value) and pro rata split of brand (as per valuation done and published by Tatas).

The ask would mean that for the Tatas 72 percent ownership in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the SP Group's ownership of 18.37 per cent in Tata Sons would entitle them to 13.22 percent stake in TCS worth Rs 1,35,000 crore at present market capitalisation, as per the statement.

The Tatas had last told the Supreme Court that they were willing to buy out the Mistrys’ share. Sources said they would respond to the latest settlement offer in court, the report added.",381,

“The Cloud practice has now assumed higher revenue priority and TCS is looking to generate significant growth,” Krishnan Ramanujam, president of business and technology services at TCS told The Economic Times. He added that each unit’s vice president will be responsible for their revenue performance.

According to Ramanujam the goal is to achieve scale and exponential growth in each platform.

“Four individual business units (AWS, Azure, Google and TCS’ own) will have their own shadow P&L.

India's largest software services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on October 14 it has seen a surge in demand for its services and expects to recruit 10,000 individuals in the US by 2022. The Mumbai-based company has hired over 21,500 employees in the past five years in the US.

""TCS has been among the top two US recruiters of IT services talent, hiring more than 21,500 employees in the past five years alone. With technology emerging as central to US enterprises' ability to respond and recover from the pandemic, TCS has seen a surge in demand for its services,"" the software firm said in a statement. To support this growth, the company expects to recruit an additional 10,000 individuals in the US by 2022, it added.

Over the past few years, Indian IT firms have significantly increased hiring in the US and other international markets as these countries have taken steps to tighten their work visa regimes. TCS' consolidated headcount stood at 4,53,540 as of September 30, 2020, with a diverse workforce comprising 147 nationalities.

The company clocked 3.6 per cent sequential growth (constant currency) in revenue to USD 2.7 billion in the September 2020 quarter from the North America market – accounting for about half of the quarter's topline. TCS has been selected as a Superbrand in the US-based on the strength of its brand reputation across channels, business performance, industry-leading job creation, scale of employee training and development, and dedication to nationwide corporate social responsibility initiatives.

Superbrands, an independent arbiter of branding, evaluated companies in the US across more than 90 industries, and TCS was one of 35 brands accorded the US Superbrands status, alongside Amazon and Google in the technology sector, the statement said.

TCS said it has invested in its TCS Pace Port co-innovation and advanced research centre at the Cornell Tech campus in New York and similar Pace Ports will be launched in 2021 in TCS Hall on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University and at other locations across the country.

Though the outlook on the market is still bullish and traders are suggested to keep a buy on dips approach, Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Group, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts:

Q) The RBI kept rates on hold but assured that the GDP rate could well turn positive by Q4. But, history suggests that stock prices are relatively better predictors of future GDP’ than the other way round. What are your views?

A) The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the repo rates unchanged as expected but markets cheered the good commentary on GDP outlook and other liquidity measures.

Research suggests that lagged GDP data has no correlation with stock returns although stock returns are relatively better predictors of GDP numbers.

The stock markets are meant to be forward-looking which does suggest faster economic recovery. But, this is subject to a lot of uncertainty created by the pandemic, and a second wave or further lockdowns can turn the entire forecast upside down.

Additionally, a number of factors have to fall in place for the GDP to materialize as planned, and given the volatility in stock markets, it is not the ideal indicator for the prediction of ground-level reality.

Q) Nifty50 reclaimed 11800 while the S&P BSE Sensex rose above 40,000 in the week gone by. What led to the price action?

A) The Nifty50 continued the rally for the 7th day in a row, but the week’s rally was one of the shallowest in terms of stock participation from Nifty50 which was less than half.

Small & midcaps did not participate in this uptrend. This rally was led by FPI’s pumping money in the Indian markets throughout the week, while DIIs continued their selling spree.

The price action was also led by positive global trends as expectations grew of a Democratic victory in US elections next month and hopes for more US stimulus. The markets cheered the RBI monetary policy and liquidity measures on Friday as well.

Q) What are the important levels and events (micro & earnings) which one should watch out for in the coming week?

A) After a swift rally of more than 1000 points, a mild pullback cannot be ruled out. Though the outlook on the market is still bullish and traders are suggested to keep a buy on dips approach.

The immediate support and resistance levels to be watched in the short term are 10700 and 12020 respectively. Quarterly results will pick up the pace next week onwards after a strong earnings result by TCS this week.

It would be important to see if other IT majors including Infosys and Wipro which will report results in the upcoming week, follow the same suit.

Q) In terms of sectors, IT and Banking stocks remained top gainers. What led to the price action in this space?

A) TCS kicked off the result season on a great start leading to price action in the IT sector. Strong results and positive management commentary fueled the rally on expectations of a multiyear tech revolution.

The rally in the banking stocks was led by positive growth in deposits and loan books announced by the majority of the private banks in their quarterly updates.

Other than that, banking stocks were also in focus due to the Supreme Court hearing on loan moratorium and interest waiver on Monday.

Q) What should investors do --- Sensex touches Mount 40K while Nifty50 trades above 11800 levels? Time to put fresh money, hold for a dip, or book profits?

A) The Nifty 50 closes above 11,900 but with low stock participation. With the result season starting, it would be prudent to wait and watch to reckon how sectors performed during the staggered unlock period by giving special importance to management commentary and demand outlook.

Going ahead, markets may witness sectoral churning and Nifty50 may continue to remain subdued with stock specific significant movements. Investors are advised to wait and watch and initiate buy positions only on dips.

Q) There are 178 stocks above Rs 500 cr Mcap that are trading below 200-DMA despite strong rally seen in benchmark indices. There are 19 stocks that fell 10-50% since March (six months), and are also trading below 200-DMA. Does that mean that investors will be better off moving away from laggards?

A) Judging a stock only on the basis of its 200-DMA would be an incorrect approach. Ideally, investors should conduct sufficient due diligence and risk profiling while separating quality gems from the abundant haystack of stocks.

If stocks have lagged and are below their trading DMA they could have either underperformed or they could be good value buys who just haven’t gained momentum yet.

It is better to study the fundamentals and reasons for their underperformance before generalizing an approach to pick stocks.

He added that the margin aspirations that the company has are real and achievable. ""The timing of it will depend on multiple parameters, but long-term demand and growth visibility is a big lever for margin support. So it is net positive for margins.”

On the near-term outlook, Gopinathan said the company remains more confident about the firm than what was shared in the last management commentary. ""We caveated saying that this is the basis for which we are going forward and we are making our investment on that basis, now we have the results and the outcomes behind us. So it gives us even more confidence in what we have shared with you. No change to what we have said.”

On customer additions, he mentioned, “If you look at new customer additions in the 1 million, 5 million, 10 million kind of a range, you will see a steady expansion of the base of the pyramid, which is always a good indicator of how new customer additions are coming through.""

The company board has also approved a share buyback up to Rs 16,000 crore at Rs 3,000 per share. The buyback price of Rs 3,000 is at a 9 percent premium to the current market price (CMP). The IT bellwether will buy back a maximum of 5.33 crore shares, equivalent to 1.42 percent equity.

The company board has also announced a salary increase which will be effective from October 1, 2020.

India's largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services' (TCS) board will meet later this week, on October 7, to consider a share buyback proposal.

""...the board of directors will consider a proposal for buyback of equity shares of the company, at its meeting to be held on October 7, 2020,"" the company informed the exchanges on October 4.

No other details of the buyback plan were disclosed.

The board is also slated to consider its financial results for the September quarter and declaration of a second interim dividend to the equity shareholders at that meeting.

In 2018, the Mumbai-based company had undertaken a share buyback programme worth up to Rs 16,000 crore. The buyback, at Rs 2,100 per equity share, had entailed up to 7.61 crore shares. In 2017 too, TCS had undertaken a similar share purchase programme.

TCS had announced the mega buyback offer as part of its long-term capital allocation policy of returning excess cash to shareholders.

In a separate filing, TCS said in the EPIC Systems Corporation matter, it would be providing Rs 1,218 crore as exceptional item, in the financial results for the three and six months ended September 30, 2020.

In October 2014, EPIC had filed a legal claim against TCS in the court of Western District Madison, Wisconsin alleging infringement of Epic''s proprietary information.

""On August 20, 2020, the US Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit, Chicago, returned a verdict on the appeal filed by TCS, reducing the damages award. The Court held that the punitive damages award of $280 million is constitutionally excessive, vacated the punitive damages award and directed the Trial Court to reassess the punitive damages,"" TCS said in its filing.

The Court upheld the compensatory damages award of $140 million, it added.

""TCS is legally advised that it has the correct and the strongest possible arguments in its favour and the Order and reduced damages are not supported by facts presented during the Trial. In September 2020, TCS has filed petition seeking re-hearing on both compensatory and punitive damages,"" TCS said.

The company said EPIC has also filed a petition seeking re-hearing on the decision of the Appeals Court invalidating award of punitive damages exceeding the amount of compensatory damages.

""The provision in the books for legal claim is being made as a matter of prudence,"" it added.

The matter relates to a US grand jury order that slapped two Tata group companies — TCS and Tata America International Corp — with a $940 million fine in a trade secret lawsuit filed against them by EPIC in April 2016.

On April 16, 2016, TCS made a disclosure to the stock exchanges regarding a US court verdict related to an intellectual property rights case with EPIC Systems.

On October 1, 2017, TCS said the court significantly reduced the compensatory and punitive damages of $940 million to $420 million.

In May this year, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had warned TCS to be careful in dealing with disclosure of material information to investors after the watchdog found that the IT major did not prominently display the extent of damages related to a case in the US.

The regulator has also asked the company to ensure that disclosures provide adequate, accurate, explicit and timely information to the investors.

Note to readers: How ​do corporate leaders surf life after hanging up their boots? What do they do next? What are the lessons they learned in their eventful journeys? What advice do they have for the current crop of leaders? Veterans Unpacked is a new series of interviews aimed to offer readers lessons from retired bosses on life outside the corner office.

FC Kohli is widely recognised as the brilliant technocrat parachuted in from the Tata Electric Companies as a General Manager to run a tech

startup that grew to become TCS — the jewel in the crown of the Tata conglomerate. Kohli was also actively involved in the decision to

bring IBM to India as part of Tata-IBM, a JV for hardware manufacturing and support in India in 1991.

As the first CEO of TCS, which pioneered India’s 'Technology Revolution' and helped the country to build the $100 billion+ IT Industry, Kohli, 97, is referred to as the ""Father of the Software Industry"". In an interview with Moneycontrol, he said that when it comes to the C-Suite, he never looks back. He advises that corporate leaders must study the future, which is more geared towards the needs of society then it was in his time. Edited excerpts:

What have you been up to since hanging up your boots?

Even after I retired I was quite active, until I turned 94. After that my needs started to change and became very different in that if there was a conference I shared what I thought about technology. The main thing is that technology is never static, it is always moving forward. I worked on an adult literacy program in or two languages to teach adults who have never been educated and that was taken as a program in other countries such as Africa and it was reported that it did help build literacy. That's perhaps the biggest contribution to my own country and government in helping increase literacy. It allows people to read starting small and basically for those who have never ever read and no options and designed especially for them.

What keeps you busy now?

Sleeping. I’m not joking: my need for sleep has gone up a lot. I am 97-years old. I still read a lot of technical journals. Was traveling until the lock-down started. I also spend a lot of time in my garden at Alibaugh and make sure the lawn is kept well.

Looking back, can you tell us about three interesting events or anything that has stayed with you since?

The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is a professional association for electronic engineering and electrical engineering with its corporate office in New York City) and they honoured me with a fellowship. I was the only non-American in the world at the time to get it which meant a lot to me. The other was a member and fellow of the South East Asia Computer Society and again there I was the only non-Singaporean to get it.

What you miss most about the C-Suite?

I don’t miss it at all. My work is complete and my job is done.

If you had to relive your corporate career again, what would you do differently?

It's very difficult to say because I don’t think I won’t have another corporate life and at 97 you see the world differently and things are improving. Let us be very clear I have done whatever I thought I could do. I’m not going back in time. But as time goes on, people who are leaders also have to move on. But acquiring knowledge is something you can do all the time.

What are the changes in the corporate world that you see now that are vastly different from your time?

Changes occur constantly and are not specific to one period but the way that technology is moving and the way people are gaining knowledge is vastly different from my time. The educational institution is very different from what I got and it means that it is easier today to gain knowledge and then build your career. It's not a starting point with an ending point. This country has to update education and teaching methods—one has to learn how to change.

Which business leader in the current crop impresses you?

No single leader has impressed me in the earlier years and while I met a lot of CEOs here and abroad as well one does get suggestions and

ideas that are part of an exchange. I had a very high opinion of JRD Tata who was also very close to me.

How did you plan for life after retirement?

I retired in 1999 at the age of 75, and for another 15 years I kept doing things that are not part of any such curriculum but to get me to

learn from people. Until the lockdown, I was going into office for two hours in the morning and two in the evening.

Is there anything you would tell your younger self?

Not really but I would say in general for anyone is that the whole world is open to you and that you have to keep learning and read whatever is the most appropriate to your industry and contribute to society and be a part of it.

What is your advice for the next cadre of corporate leaders?

My advice is that you must study the future, which is more geared towards the needs of society then it was in my time. That is the difference and so no question that all the corporates want the best out of their people and want them to do what the times require but what is also required for corporates is to look into their people’s education levels and maybe they have to provide for people to educate themselves.

2020-10-01 11:37:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/sending-funds-abroad-be-aware-of-the-tax-collected-at-source-rules-5902841.html,"Rishabh Parakh

Be ready to pay a 5 per cent tax (i.e., TCS: tax collected at source) on your remittances done under the LRS (Liberalised Remittance Scheme), if it crosses Rs 7 lakh in a financial year. This tax was proposed in the Union Budget 2020 and will be applicable from October 1.

Is it a newly introduced tax?

No, this is not an additional tax liability, so do not confuse this as a tax on transferring funds abroad. This tax is like TDS on your salary or other professional payments where you get credit for the taxes deducted. You will get credit for the 5 per cent TCS, and it will be reflected in your Form 26AS. You can either claim it as a tax refund while filing your tax returns or adjust it against your outstanding tax liability.

Transactions under LRS and applicability of the TCS:

Money can be remitted under the LRS option for several purposes.

- Medical treatment, donations, gifts, maintenance of a close relative

- Overseas education

- Foreign travel

- Investment, like property or international stocks

How will this work?

The 5 per cent TCS will be deducted for remittance amounts exceeding Rs 7 lakh. For example, if you are remitting Rs 12 lakh in a year, 5 per cent will be calculated on Rs 5 lakh (Rs 12 lakh - Rs 7 lakh). So, Rs 25,000 will be deducted as TCS.

An important point to note here is that this Rs 7 lakh exemption limit is applicable for the current financial year, i.e., April 1, 2020 till March 31, 2021, though the rule will be applicable from October 1, 2020. So, if you have remitted any money after March 2020, then that will be counted while calculating the Rs 7 lakh exemption limit. For example, if you transferred Rs 5 lakh before October and then made another transfer of Rs 8 lakh after October 2020, then this 5 per cent TCS will be calculated on Rs 13 lakh (total transfer value) minus Rs 7 lakh (exempted value) which comes to Rs 6 lakh. So, 5 per cent of Rs 6 lakh, i.e. Rs 30,000 will be charged as TCS.

In case your remittance before October 2020 was more than Rs 7 lakh, then there is no need to pay 5 per cent retrospectively. It is applicable for all transactions done on or after October 1, 2020. Transactions in the current financial year, that is, from March 2020 onward, will count toward this tax if remittances are made after October 2020, with the total exceeding the exemption limit.

Are TCS and the exemption limit applicable to all transactions uniformly?

Yes, the 5 per cent TCS and Rs 7 lakh exemption limit applies to most of the remittance transactions except in the following cases:

Overseas travel package: When you remit money for purchasing an overseas travel tour package, you would not get the exemption of Rs 7 lakh and have to pay TCS on the total amount of remittance. For example, if you pay Rs. 10 lakh towards an overseas travel package, then you need to pay 5 per cent TCS on the entire Rs 10 lakh.

Non-furnishing of PAN: If you do not furnish your PAN details, then tax will be collected at the rate of 10 per cent instead of 5 per cent.

Overseas education: This is good news for all students going abroad for studies. The 5 per cent TCS rate will be reduced to 0.5 per cent for those who have taken an education loan. The exemption limit of Rs 7 lakh will be allowed as long as the education loan follows the norms defined under section 80E of the Income Tax Act.

Let us understand this in simple terms from the following table:

How do you get this TCS money back?

There are two ways by which you can get credit for the 5 per cent TCS. One is to claim an Income Tax refund, and the other is to claim TCS against your other tax liabilities for the year. If you claim a refund, you need to wait for the tax filing period.

Let me give you an example of Ankita who is working for an IT company, earning Rs 30 lakh as annual salary. Let us assume that she remits Rs 12 lakh abroad for investing in the international market. As per the new rule, she would pay Rs 25,000 (5 per cent on Rs 5 lakh i.e. 12 lakh – 7 lakh). Now, she is allowed to either claim the same as a tax refund while filing her tax return or offset against her other tax liabilities. If she does not have any income other than salary, she can submit the TCS certificate to her employer and get her TDS reduced accordingly. The same treatment applies to businesspersons for offsetting the TCS amount against their tax liability or for claiming a tax refund. You would get a TCS certificate from the deductor like you get your form 16/TDS certificate, which is proof of having tax deducted.

Named H-1B One Workforce Grant Program, the funding comes from the fees companies pay for H-1B petitions, and, hence, the name.

This raises two questions:

1. What does this mean for the Indian IT sector, which is the largest beneficiary of the highly skilled H-1B visas?

2. Can the IT industry attract talent, minus onsite opportunity?

Before answering the questions, let us look a little more into what this programme attempts to do.

The programme aims to upskill the workforce in the areas of information technology and cybersecurity, and advanced manufacturing and transportation, which is the future workforce.

This is in a bid to address the changing workforce dynamics that is now tilted towards emerging technologies.

For the funding, the Department of Labor will tap into the fees paid by the companies sponsoring H-1B petitions.

Shivendra Singh, Vice President and Head of Global Trade Development, National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), said: “Under this program, a series of grants will be made available to select organisations for qualified local workforce training and skills development initiative. It is meant to help US citizens.”

What does it mean for the IT sector?

According to Singh, there is no direct benefit for the IT sector since the idea is to impart skill to the local workforce. “For Indian IT companies in the US, this could potentially mean a likely increase in technical talent/ STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) qualified workers available locally in the US,” he added.

This also means that with more talents likely to come into the workforce in the US, IT firms will be encouraged to hire Americans than bring more Indians to the US through the H-1B route.

This also addresses concerns of IT services firms that there is a talent crunch, and, hence, they are using H-1B visas to bridge the gap, which the latest announcement is looking to fix to some extent.

Also Read: Good news for US Green Card aspirants: COVID-19 shortens the queue for H-1B/L-1 visa holders

Sure, bridging the talent gap will not happen overnight. But this fits well into the narrative of stepping up local hiring, which most of the IT firms have done over the last few years and the reducing demand for H-1B visas.

Visa dependency for IT firms came down by 40-60 percent over the last three years. Infosys recently said that it would hire 12,000 more locals in the US by 2022. TCS already has hired close to 20,000 Americans in the US. More than 60 percent of Wipro and HCL Tech employees in the US are Americans.

Attracting talent

This brings us to the second question about attracting talent.

Yugal Joshi, Vice President, Everest Group, an IT consultancy firm, has said in an earlier interaction: “Onshore deployment is a major attraction for employees and if that reduces, it will impact the IT industry positioning as an employer.”

Unlike multinational firms in India, Indian IT services firms offer more opportunities to travel to the US, given that the country accounts for about 60 percent of their revenue. Of the 85,000 H-1B visas issued every year, Indian IT services firms accounted for a significant share.

This was an attractive proposition of techies in the country and an incentive to join IT companies.

Pareekh Jain, founder, Pareekh Consulting, said that without the incentive of onsite opportunities and higher salary than multinationals, Indian IT services might have difficulty attracting good talent, if not now, post the pandemic.

“IT firms were already finding it difficult to attract good talent in the last few years as they were competing with startups, and multinationals that have set up offices in India,” he pointed out.

These companies were offering attractive packages compared to IT firms. Lack of onsite opportunity, Jain said, has created a level-playing field and IT firms will have to bring in innovative hiring strategies to be an attractive employer.

Some of the IT firms have introduced multiple salary structures while hiring in colleges. For instance, product arms in IT firms could hire separately as the type of talent and salary needed are different.",705,-0.13601555065675217

Tata Consultancy Services has opened its National Qualifier Test (NQT) to corporates to help them in their fresher recruitment programmes, and the IT major has received interest from various companies for being a part of the initiative. Till last year, NQT was restricted to hiring for TCS.

NQT – which is conducted by TCS’ strategic unit TCS iON – is a multi-level assessment to assess competence on core cognitive abilities required for entry-level jobs, industry-specific knowledge and insights, and specialisation on skills required for performing the job role.

Introduced in 2018, NQT last year saw more than 3.6 lakh students participating from over 2,600 colleges.

""NQT will now be a common gateway test for several participating corporates for their fresher recruitment programmes. This standardised test will provide candidates with access to open positions at multiple corporates giving millions of young jobseekers an opportunity to work for India’s top corporates,” TCS iON Global Head Venguswamy Ramaswamy told PTI.

It will provide subscribing corporates with a well-rounded evaluation of candidates’ abilities, and access to quality talent across the nation at speed and scale, he added.

""A large number of leading corporates including Croma, Titan, Kirloskar and Godrej have shown interest in participating in this hiring process,” Ramaswamy said.

Besides, the company is also in touch with small businesses across 600 cities in India so that students from these locations can get the NQT score and smaller enterprises can hire local talent, he added.

Young professionals with up to two years of experience, as well as students from any stream, currently enrolled in pre-final/final year of undergraduate or postgraduate programs can apply for the test.

""The test acts as a single window for job opportunities across leading organisations in IT, BFSI, manufacturing, pharma, and FMCG sectors, including TCS,” Ramaswamy said.

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, TCS iON will allow candidates take the test from their homes.

To ensure inclusion, candidates without access to the necessary infrastructure at home also have the option of taking the test from a TCS iON centre.

There are 600 such centres from where the students can take the test, and depending on the applications, the centres will be prepared to ensure that social distancing and sanitation protocols are followed.

The test will focus on general abilities covering verbal, numerical and reasoning abilities to arrive at the normalised NQT score that can be presented to corporates as a demonstration of the candidate’s cognitive abilities.

A subject NQT, focused on programming, is also being planned keeping in mind the huge demand for this skill in the IT industry.

TCS iON intends to continuously improve the test design to provide employers with a better understanding of candidates’ abilities.

The NQT will be conducted every quarter and the score will be valid for two years.

The first test, which will be available for free, will be held from October 24-26.

Registrations are open until October 17.

Employees at IT majors accounted for the highest numbers among those who availed of the advance employees' provident fund (EPF) withdrawal benefit offered during the COVID-19 pandemic.

At Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), 33,745 staff availed of COVID-19 advances totalling Rs 1.5 crore from their employees’ provident fund (EPF) during the April-July period, according to a report by Financial Express.

Among the top five private companies where the largest number of employees availed of the EPF benefit, three were IT companies - TCS, HCL Technologies (11,957 claims), and Infosys (5,534 claims), the report said, citing EPFO data.

These three companies accounted for 17 percent of the total claims for advancement settled during the April-July period.

The IT sector will continue to be an attractive destination for job seekers as demand for technology will only increase in the post pandemic world, said Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).

Speaking at the live interaction organised by LinkedIn on August 26, Gopinathan said, “The employment potential of India’s IT sector will continue to be quite strong and will relatively keep growing in pace with where we see the opportunity (because) demand for talent and services are only going to explode, given the role that technology is playing today and in future.”

Gopinathan pointed out that demand for digital has only increased over the last five months and companies like TCS are the forefront to take advantage of this demand, according to Kotak Institutional Equities report.

The report, quoting Gartner, estimates that IT spending would increase to 6-8 percent from 4-5 percent in the next four years, with COVID-19 pushing companies to accelerate spending.

Commenting on this, Gopinathan said there are kind of three horizons in which enterprises need to think about. ""The first horizon, which has been further accelerated by the pandemic, is how resilient is your digital core. The second phase of it has been significantly driven by innovation and research and integrating them into your operating model. Phase three is a more challenging one and that will define it as purpose-led changes to industry structure by adopting ecosystems as an operating model.""

Current demand in IT job landscape is reflective of these changes. While the demand for skills such as cloud, data analytics and cybersecurity has gone up, those who are unable to transition are losing their jobs. It is estimated that close to one lakh techies would lose their jobs amid COVID-19.

IT companies have also accelerated their reskilling efforts in the areas of cloud and cybersecurity in an effort to help employees transition to the new normal.",328,0.4998268783092499

Indian IT services providers Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys would benefit the most from the accelerated IT spending by their clients across sectors, according to a report by Kotak Institutional Equities.

The report states that companies have accelerated their spending in innovative capabilities to reduce operating costs, reimagine customer experience, and move to newer business at the back of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to Gartner, outsourced IT services spend will increase to 6-8 percent between 2021-24, from 4-5 percent in the last 10 years due to acceleration in digital transformation spending.

TCS and Infosys will be at the forefront of these changes given their comprehensive offerings, ability to win large integrated deals, and process capability, the report added.

Apart from these two, HCL Technologies and Wipro too have robust digital infrastructure layer that they will be able to leverage.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

These companies have also partnered with cloud hyperscalers like Google Cloud, Azure and Amazon Web Services and software-as-a-service providers to help their clients through the digital transformation journey, and are in the right space to help their clients at the back of the pandemic.

However, there is a catch. While clients are migrating to cloud at much faster pace, IT companies are unlikely to get the full benefit.

The report said while cloud service providers may see a 20-33 percent growth, the related growth for IT service providers would be low. “The surge post-COVID-19 can create new opportunities though not of the scale witnessed with cloud hyperscalers,” the report added.

In terms of customers, retail clients are investing in online platforms as shops were closed due to the pandemic to drive sales. Large retailers such as Lowes and Kohl are investing in digital platforms to increase online sales. For instance, e-commerce sales increased from 6 percent in FY19 to 8 percent between January and June for Unilever. For Nestle, the report said, e-commerce penetration increased from 8.5 percent in FY19 to 12.4 percent now.

Healthcare companies are ramping up their telehealth and telemedicine capabilities as the pandemic and lockdown have pushed the demand for these services. The US healthcare company Anthem’s on-demand telehealth solution surpassed one million visits in early April.

Tata Consultancy Services and two other vendors have been shortlisted for implementation of Integrated Market Surveillance System, according to an RBI document. The Reserve Bank of India had received responses from several vendors for implementation of Integrated Market Surveillance System (IMSS) after it invited Expression of Interest (EOI) in July last year.

The RBI's document said responses were evaluated in accordance with the procedure laid down in the EOI, and accordingly it has been decided to shortlist three vendors -- NSEIT Limited, Refinitiv India Private Limited, and Tata Consultancy Services Limited -- for issuance of Request for Proposal (RFP).

""The RFP will be issued to shortlisted vendors through a separate communication at a later date,"" it said.

The RBI has proposed to implement IMSS, which would include capabilities for market surveillance, management information system (MIS) reports, standard and ad hoc reports (through slicing and dicing of data), and compliance monitoring.

The Financial Markets Regulation Department (FMRD) undertakes surveillance of financial markets regulated by the RBI - government securities market, money market, foreign exchange market and markets for derivatives on interest rate, foreign exchange and credit.

In the EOI, the RBI had said the department has proposed to implement a robust Integrated Market Surveillance System for augmenting its surveillance capacities.

As per the EOI, the major requirements for IMSS include capability to identify market abuse and generate alerts by processing large number of data points across products and markets.

Tracking market developments and monitoring of macroeconomic parameters, dashboard to focus on specific products or markets, and capacity to drill-down based on the requirements of the stakeholders are among the other requirements for IMSS.

The RBI strives to adopt the global best practices, including three-tier architecture for all its applications and expects the proposed solution to align to these best practices, EOI had said.

It also said that for evaluation of RFP, the bidders selected during EOI stage may be asked to carry out Proof of Concept (PoC) in the bank's environment based on the scenarios provided to them.",347,0.7864192128181458

With the Covid pandemic wreaking havoc on normal life globally, Digital has never been as important as it is now for IT services providers. For many of their clients, Digital is the only way business can run and the IT companies’ recent results bear testimony to that.

TCS, India’s largest IT services provider, boasted deal wins worth $6.9 billion in the quarter ended June, a 15 percent year-on-year increase. The majority of the deals are in what IT companies call the Digital segment, which includes new-age services such as cloud.

But unlike its global rival Accenture, and local peers such as Wipro, which in addition to building in-house products make acquisitions that complements its portfolio, TCS has been building digital products and platform solutions in-house for its clients. It would not be a stretch to say that the company’s robust digital portfolio has been built from scratch.

However, there are doubts over whether this in-house product and platform development strategy is working given that TCS’s growth continues to decline despite the digital portion growing.

Over the last five quarters, TCS’s year-on-year revenue growth has seen a decline. The double-digit growth the company saw in the beginning of FY20 dropped to 6.8 percent in September on a constant currency basis year on year.

Source: TCS fact sheet

TCS’s peers Infosys and HCL Tech reported double-digit growth during the same period. Even during the pandemic, while TCS’s deal wins rose 15 percent, its margins missed market estimates by 160 basis points, a Motilal Oswal note said. Infosys has done better in this aspect.

Apples and oranges?

To be sure, it might not be fair to compare these Indian IT service providers with TCS, given the scale at which it operates. TCS’s revenues for FY20 stood at $22 billion versus Infosys’ $12 billion, Wipro’s $8.6 billion and HCL Tech’s $9.9 billion.

Digital accounted for 33 percent of TCS’s revenue for the quarter ended September 2019. During the results announcement for the second quarter in October, the company stopped reporting the metric citing the difficulty it faced differentiating between Digital and Core revenue.

Most experts agreed that at TCS’s scale, one cannot expect growth to be the same as that of its peers. “Large size does play its part in TCS growth. Moreover, unlike earlier years, now TCS has to fend off competition from accounts where it is the incumbent,” said Yugal Joshi, Vice President, Everest group, a consultancy firm.

However, TCS’s larger global rival Accenture, whose FY19 revenue stood at $43.2 billion, saw its revenue grow at an average rate of 8 percent versus 7 percent average for TCS in the comparable period (Accenture follows a September-August fiscal year). Digital accounts for about 70 percent of Accenture’s revenue.

Long-term payoff?

So, why is India’s largest IT services firm seeing a decline? And where does digital figure in all this? Experts and analysts say there might not be a simple answer.

Over the years, TCS has done reasonably well when it comes to developing platforms and services. “It is not a secret that TCS focuses on building capabilities organically,” Joshi told Moneycontrol. They have done so at scale and at a much faster pace than the others, he added.

However, it will take time for these investments to yield results and gain momentum. Sanchit Vir Gogia, founder, Greyhound Research, pointed out that TCS iON, which is widely adopted, had been in the making for more than a decade.

The company is investing significantly in the space and it takes few more quarters to materialise, he added.

V Ramakrishnan, CFO, TCS, said in a recent interaction with Moneycontrol that products and platforms such as ignio and BaNCS have gained traction in the wake of Covid-19 and will be one of the key growth drivers for the company.

During the earnings call on July 9, TCS Chief Executive Rajesh Gopinathan said ignio, its cognitive automation software, acquired eight new logos in Q1. BaNCS, the financial services suite, accounted for seven new wins.

TCS’s other products and platform solutions include Quartz Smart Ledgers, a blockchain solution that had two wins and HOBS, a software-as-a-service platform for communication service providers, which accounted for four new wins.

Acquisitions do not guarantee success

While its rivals have often relied on acquisitions to tap new areas and drive growth, the experts say this does not always pay off. “In recent times large acquisitions done by Europe-centric service providers have struggled. Many peers have struggled integrating acquired digital firms and creating a cohesive consistent story for their clients,” Joshi explained.

“So, it is difficult to comment on whether merger and acquisition is the right way to go or not,” he added.

Also TCS is not exactly shying away from acquisitions given that it acquired W12 and Bridge Point group in 2018. Gopinathan, too, said that TCS would make acquisitions when the time is right.

Given that it takes time to scale up the products, Pareekh Jain, founder, Pareekh Consulting, a tech consultancy firm, pointed out that there is a need to shift focus. One way to do it could be by widening its focus to other geographies such as the Asia Pacific region, India and Latin America, apart from the US and Europe, through smaller acquisitions, as Wipro has done. Wipro recently acquired a Brazil-based company IVIA Serviços de Informática to strengthen its presence in the region.

An analyst explained that TCS also need to take more risks when it comes to upping its risk metric when it comes to digital engagements, which not many IT firms have so far.",1213,0.13519964615503946

The Department of Telecommunication (DoT) has relaxed norms for facilitating work from home (WFH) for IT firms till the end of 2020 due to the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, outbreak.

In an order dated July 21, DoT, said, “In the view of ongoing concerns due to COVID-19, the department has decided to further extend these relaxation up to December 31, or until further orders, whichever is earlier.”

The order for relaxation, which was first granted till April 30, was extended to July 31.

The relaxation is for the Other Service Provider (OSP) licence, which is necessary for companies to enable WFH. Earlier, Nasscom has written to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to make relaxations around WFH permanent. But the industry is now looking to adopt a hybrid working model on the back of the pandemic.

The relaxation will give companies enough room to extend WFH for all their employees until the end of the year. As per current State government orders, IT companies can operate anywhere between 30 percent and 50 percent capacity.

In Pune, where the lockdown was imposed for 10 days from July 13, companies can work at 30 percent capacity.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), despite its weak performance in Q1FY21 as compared to its peer Infosys, emerged as the preferred choice for long-term investment, a Moneycontrol poll of readers showed.

In a social media poll conducted on Facebook, 51 percent of respondents favoured TCS for investment for the next year while on Linkedin, 58 percent of votes were in favour of TCS.

However, on Twitter, the majority (43.5 percent) went with Infosys. TCS fetched 40.8 percent votes and Wipro 15.7 percent.

TCS reported a 13.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall in Q1 profit, partially impacted by a 67.8 percent YoY decline in other income to Rs 456 crore.

On the other hand, Infosys posted an 11.5 percent YoY growth in net profit at Rs 4,233 crore while Wipro posted a flat 0.11 percent YoY growth in net profit at Rs 2,390.40 crore.

The June quarter numbers are expected to come weak due to coronavirus pandemic. Experts advise treating Q1 numbers as aberrations and focus more on the outlook and management commentary which is what seems to have helped investors maintain their faith in TCS.

""The revenue impact of the pandemic played out broadly along the lines we had anticipated at the start of the quarter. It affected all verticals, with the exception of life sciences and healthcare, with varying levels of impact. We believe it has bottomed out, and we should now start tracing our path to growth,"" Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and Managing Director of TCS, said when the Q1 earnings of the company were announced on July 9.

A tug of war

The Q1 numbers garnered mixed reviews for TCS from top global brokerages. On the other hand, they hailed Infosys for its surprising Q1 show.

Global brokerage firm CLSA kept 'outperform' rating on TCS after the results and raised the target price to Rs 2,260 from Rs 2,240.

""The Q1 margin was a miss but cashflow is stable and the outlook is optimistic. The company has exuded confidence of a recovery in the second half of the year,"" CLSA pointed out.

The BFSI demand showed that there is a better resilience with the healthy deal pipeline. It has changed FY21/FY22 EPS estimates by -3 percent/0 percent, CNBC-TV18 reported, quoting CLSA saying so.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services, which has a 'neutral' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,300 underscored TCS should be able to better navigate through challenges against the rest of the industry.

""Over the medium-term, we expect TCS to be a key beneficiary of the COVID-19-driven increase in technology intensity across verticals,"" Motilal said.

Macquarie downgraded TCS to neutral from outperform, with a target price of Rs 1,900 and said the company's growth recovery will be gradual given the uncertainties, while margin drag will remain till the growth recovers.

Macquarie said the EBIT margin of TCS may decline 80 bps in FY21 & improve 160 bps in FY22.

The result of Infosys surprised analysts and the market. Top global brokerages, such as UBS (target price: Rs 810), CLSA (target price: Raised to Rs 1,000 from Rs 860), Nomura (target price: Rs 975) and Citi (Target price: Raised to Rs 1,000 from Rs 825) recommended a 'buy' on the stock after the results were announced.

UBS said that the company’s Q1 numbers beat expectations, while FY21 guidance is a big positive and should help narrow valuation discount to TCS.

CLSA said the company could be the only scale player to report YoY growth in FY21.

CLSA raised FY21/FY22 EPS estimates by 9 percent and said with the restoration of formal guidance, PER gap with TCS should decline.

As per Nomura, the company’s digital positioning, silver linings during the COVID-19 outbreak, bodes well for the demand recovery.

Citi raised EPS estimates of the company by 6-7 percent for FY21E-23 and increased the target multiple to 23 times FY22 from 20 times.

Jyoti Roy DVP- Equity Strategist at Angel Broking said in light of the Q1 numbers and management guidance, Infosys appears better-placed at the current prices as compared to TCS over the next one year.

""While TCS numbers came below street estimates, Infosys reported numbers which were well above street estimates with dollar revenues contracting by 2.4 percent QoQ, as compared to street estimates of 4-5 percent degrowth,"" Roy said.

The management’s revenue growth guidance of 0-2 percent growth in constant currency terms for FY2021 also surprised markets positively and helped reaffirm the market's faith in the company.

""At the current levels, Infosys is trading at P/E multiple of 19.5 times FY22 EPS estimate which is at nearly 12 percent discount to TCS. Though the valuation gap has narrowed significantly post the Infosys numbers, we expect Infosys to continue outperforming TCS in the near-term and expect the valuation gap to narrow further from current levels,"" Roy said.

Technical View

IT sector has been one of the major outperformer in the last four months pullback since market bottoming out in March 2020. IT major TCS has lead the way and is currently placed at the cusp of breakout above the last two year almost identical highs (Rs 2275 and 2296 respectively). We expect the stock to resolve above the same thus offering fresh entry opportunity

The entire up move of the last four months is well channelled signalling sustained demand at elevated level. It has recently rebounded taking support at the lower band of the rising channel signalling strength and positive price structure. We expect the stock to continue with its positive momentum and head towards Rs 2550 levels in the coming months as it is the 138.2% external retracement of the CY 2020 decline (Rs 2260-1506) placed at Rs 2550 levels

Fundamental View

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is an IT service company catering to various segments like Banking & Insurance (~30% of revenues), Communication (~7%), Manufacturing (~10%), Life science & Healthcare (~8%) Technology & Services (~9%), Regional Markets (~20%) and CPG & Retail (~15%). Geographically the company generates ~52% revenues from Americas, 31% from Europe and 17% from Rest of the world. We expect TCS to report improving growth in coming quarters mainly led by receding challenges on supply side, ramp up of deals, vendor consolidation opportunities and traction in BFSI. The company also expects cloud, customer experience, automation and cyber security related digital technologies to gain traction in long term. We believe TCS could see a decline in FY21E revenues mainly due to a weak first quarter. However, we expect the company to register healthy growth in FY22E mainly led by ramp up of deal pipeline and acceleration in digital technologies

TCS Q1FY21 earnings were below our estimates on all fronts as Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the business performance of the company. Consolidated revenue stood at Rs 3,83,220 mn, below our estimate of Rs 3,95,458 mn, registering +0.4% YoY/-4.1% QoQ. Consolidated EBIT stood at Rs 90,480 mn, down by -1.9% YoY/-9.7% QoQ. On the margins front, EBIT margin contracted by 54bps YoY to 23.6% due to higher employee costs and depreciation expenses. Consolidated PAT saw a decline of 13.8% YoY to Rs 70,090 mn, vs 81,270 mn in Q1FY20 due to lower other income. The board recommended an interim dividend of Rs 5 per equity share of Rs 1 each of the company.



Outlook

TCS also expects Q3FY21 INR revenue to be equal to Q3FY20. At CMP of Rs 2204, TCS currently trades at FY20 P/E of 25.5x Factoring in weak Q1FY21 results, we slightly lowered our FY21/FY22 estimates. We value TCS at PE of 25x to its FY22E EPS of Rs 94, which yields a target price of Rs 2339 per share. We upgrade our rating to Hold from Neutral earlier.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on TCS

For 1QFY21, TCS missed our revenue (USD) / EBIT estimate by 2%/6%. However, in our view, this is not worrying given the unprecedented damage global economies have witnessed. The management undertook the best possible efforts to optimize cost (SG&A = 12.3% of sales v/s 13.5% in 4Q) and cash conversion (OCF/PAT = 133% v/s 109% in 4Q), which provided great comfort. Similar to Accenture, underlying trends were resilient. However, as we highlighted in our earlier note, lower exposure to the Healthcare vertical (10% of revenue v/s 18% for the former), which has continued to show strong traction, partly led to higher overall revenue decline. Deal wins (USD6.9b ex-Phoenix deal; +21% YoY) were stronger than our expectations (USD5.5–6.0b). More importantly, continued traction in large deals, a healthy pipeline, and better resilience in BFSI are encouraging factors. Management believes the worst impact of COVID-19 is behind (both in terms of revenue and profitability) even as some variables such as pricing and working capital cycles warrant a close watch. We expect TCS to be a key beneficiary of the COVID-19-led increase in tech intensity across verticals.



Outlook

Rich multiples (22x FY22E EPS) leave limited upside in the stock, in our view. Accordingly, we remain NEUTRAL on the stock despite being positive on the company.

Shares of Tata Group firms such as Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Consumer and Tata Power Company were trading higher on BSE in the afternoon on July 17 ahead of the group's meet.

Shares of Tata Power, Tata Steel and Tata Metaliks rose up to 4 percent while those of Tata Motors, Titan Company, Tata Consumer Products and Tata Coffee rose up to 2 percent.

However, shares of Tata Communications, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Tata Elxsi traded in the red.

Tata Sons board is set to meet later in the day to take stock of the coronavirus situation and assess the impact on individual companies, CNBC-TV18 reported sources as saying.

With many states unlocking, it is important to discuss operations across group companies and the plan of action for states that are undergoing more lockdowns.

Another key point will fund infusion into group companies after assessing the requirements, said sources. The two companies to keep a close watch on are Tata Steel and JLR, the report said.

The board will also assess the debt-reduction plan for companies as it wants to deleverage and reduce risks across the group. A long-term strategy for businesses like aviation, consumer, and IT may also be on the agenda.

The group may also look to fast track merger of businesses with a similar business focus, something that has been on the agenda for a while. Reports have also indicated that Tata Sons was the only company in the race for Air India assets. The bidding strategy may also be on the agenda, CNBC-TV18 reported.

TCS will selectively open lateral hiring and will go ahead with fresher hiring in geographies such as the US though the numbers are small at the back of the pandemic.

This comes as a surprise as companies are freezing hiring to cut costs. This is a move TCS reversed in the first quarter. Announcing the results for the March quarter, the company said that, while the company would honour all the offers, there would be a freeze on lateral hiring at the back of COVID-19.

Has the situation changed for the better? V Ramakrishnan, Chief Financial Officer, seems to think so. The worst is over, at least for TCS, he said during a recent interaction with Moneycontrol.

As per CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, the company has better visibility now and expects recovery from the third quarter onwards.

The confidence, Ramakrishnan says, comes from the strong order pipeline, heightened conversation with customers and also the kind of opportunities they are seeing.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

What has changed in the last three months?

Ramakrishnan explained that even amid the pandemic, countries across the world have been opening up the economy in a calibrated manner. “As economies open up and different sectors start opening up, it (business) should slowly start coming back to normal,” he said.

When it comes to industries, sectors such as banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), manufacturing and essential retail are adapting to the new normal and are embracing latest technologies to ensure business continuity.

It could be contactless banking, touchless delivery for essential retail or managing a robust supply chain for a manufacturing firm. Of the $6.9 billion order TCS signed for the quarter ending June 2020 even amid the pandemic, $2.3 billion was from BFSI and another large deal from manufacturing.

“So that is one indicator,” he added.

In terms of technology, there is a huge demand for migration to cloud, data analytics and TCS' own products and platforms such as Ignio, a cognitive automation product of TCS. Customers are spending significantly on cybersecurity with applications going online. In addition, some of the clients are also fast tracking their transformational agendas.

“So this is where opportunities are. Pipeline, if you look at it, it is healthy and it has a mix of large as well as small deal and that also gives us confidence,” he added.

This confidence and positivity has what led to opening up lateral hiring. “As far as laterals are concerned, they will be selective, depending on the requirement and markets where there is demand. Right now we don’t have a specific plan on a number,” Ramakrishnan said.

TCS is also going ahead with its fresher hiring in geographies such as the US though the numbers will be smaller.

Visa issues

H-1B visa ban till December and the US government's recent move not to issue student visa to students in the US whose classes have moved online could present challenges in the long-term.

According to Ramkrishnan, the US is the most innovative country in the world right now, and the largest innovation still comes out of the country.

“That is primarily because they have invested in meritocracy and also because of opportunities that have been made available for entrepreneurs and for the students for their higher education STEM education,” he added.



“If we have constraints on that, it is going to affect the technological leadership, our customers and it will also affect people like us,” Ramakrishnan added.

Will it change the current model? Ramakrishnan pointed out that the company has always found a way and its distributed agile model (remote working) would help. “But is it the most optimum way to do it? Perhaps not,” he said Challenges

There are challenges of course. The company’s revenue declined 7.8 percent to $5059 million in constant currency for the quarter ending June 2020 on a year-on-year basis. While Europe registered 2.7 percent growth, its other geographies such as the US and UK reported decline in growth of 6 percent and 8.5 percent respectively.

With the exception of life sciences and healthcare, other major verticals’ growth declined in the range of 4-13 percent.

While the company expects the US market to see recovery in the coming quarters, there is not much certainty over the UK, which is struggling from COVID-19 and also Brexit.

Ramakrishnan pointed out that while the company is positive, the growth does depend on whether there are too many frequent lockdowns in different cities. There could also be a possibility of recurrence and there could be a fall back because of that.

“But hopefully, it will not be,” said Ramakrishnan.",1047,-0.20382988055547077

The share price of the IT service major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) closed 0.78 percent up at Rs 2,221.65 on July 10, a day after the company reported its June quarter numbers.

The company reported 12.9 percent QoQ declined in the June quarter profit at Rs 7,008 crore, dented by lockdown-led supply and demand challenges.

The year-on-year fall in profit stood at 13.8 percent, which partially impacted by a 67.8 percent YoY (down 19 percent QoQ) decline in other income to Rs 456 crore.

Consolidated revenue declined 4.1 percent sequentially to Rs 38,322 crore in the quarter ended June, impacted by all segments, barring banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI). However, revenue increased 0.4 percent YoY.

CLSA | Rating: Outperform | Target: Raised to Rs 2,260 from Rs 2,240 per share

The Q1 margin was a miss but cashflow is stable and the outlook is optimistic. The company has exuded confidence of a recovery in the H2.

The BFSI demand showed that there is a better resilience with the healthy deal pipeline. It has changed FY21/FY22 EPS estimates by -3 percent/0 percent, CNBC-TV18 reported.

Macquarie | Rating: Downgrade to neutral from outperform | Target: Rs 1,900 per share

The growth recovery will be gradual given the uncertainties, while margin drag will remain till the growth recovers. The EBIT margin may decline 80 bps in FY21 & improve 160 bps in FY22, reported CNBC-TV18.

Kotak Institutional Equities| Rating: Reduce

The key highlight in Q1 was a strong 21 percent YoY growth in the new deals. It has cut FY21-23 EPS estimates by 2-4 percent, reported CNBC-TV18.

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 2,300

While the peak of COVID-19-led uncertainty may be behind, near-term negative surprises related to demand, pricing, and collections cannot be ruled out.

Nevertheless, TCS should be able to better navigate through these challenges (v/s the rest of the industry). Over the medium term, we expect TCS to be a key beneficiary of the COVID-19-driven increase in technology intensity across verticals.

Dolat Capital | Rating: Reduce | Target: Rs 2,070

Given higher-than-expected slide and softer-than-expected tone on recovery broking house have curtailed its growth estimates by 1 percent and 2 percent, respectively for FY21 and 22E. Also given the deeper than expected OPM cut in Q1, it has moderated the OPM estimates by 60bps/40bps respectively for FY21/22E.

It expects growth of 3 percent CC QoQ in USD revenues led by about 130bps tailwinds from supply-side normalisation and recovery of demand following the gradual opening of business across the globe.

Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Hold | Target: Rs 2,116

While TCS will see declining FY21 earnings growth due to COVID-19 led business disruption, broking house expects it to bounce back to sustained double-digit growth from FY22 as it resumes market share gains.

It has increased EPS estimates (2.6 percent avg) of FY22/23E led by revenue upgrade of 2.5 percent led by pent-up demand and now value TCS on 21X (earlier 20X, due to market share gains) Sep-22 EPS of Rs 100 and arrive at a changed target price of Rs 2116 (earlier Rs 1982).",543,-0.14895847910328916

TCS: Every dip should be considered a buying opportunity

The stock has registered a new all-time high at Rs 2,302 this week. It has seen a rally of over 54 percent since the bottom of 1,494 registered in March 2020.

Recently, TCS has shown a breakout above 2,132 levels, which happens to be the previous top on the short-term charts. Now, the level of 2,132 has become a strong support for the short-term.

TCS has been finding a strong resistance in the zone of 2,200-2,250 for the previous five quarters. In the current quarter, the stock has shown some signs of breaking out from this upper band of 2250.

We are very conservative in bringing people to work. Our strategy will vary depending on the COVID-19 situation in each country and each city.”

The management expects it will have only 5 percent of its workforce coming to office by the September-end. Also, these employees will have to be in office only 25 percent of the time, aligning with its Vision 25x25.

What is Vision 25x25?The company believes that by 2025, only 25 percent of its associates will need to work out of facilities at any point of time. Also, employees will not need to spend more than 25 percent of their time at work.

This model has been made possible by the Secured Borderless Workspaces (SBWS), which is secure, agile and has earned clients’ confidence, the management said. The company has also ramped up its security operations to monitor over four lakh endpoint devices that are connected remotely.

TCS employed about 4.43 lakh employees at the end of June.

Investing in campusesHowever, that does not mean investments are not happening in physical campus infrastructure. TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said the company is investing in dual operating model, both campuses and SBWS.

NG Subramaniam, COO, TCS, said, “All 118 delivery centres and campuses are now open and have significantly altered the way it will function taking in to account regulation aspects and guidelines that we receive from authorities and prioritising employee safety.”

This includes establishing safe operating zones, where maximum 100-120 people will be operating whenever they come to office. Other initiatives include contact tracing and monitoring the way employees reach office, interact with people and way they move. All this so that employees travelling to and from are safe in office and also at home, he added.

IT bellwether Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will start on-boarding of 40,000 freshers in a phased manner from mid-July. It will also start lateral hiring of freshers selectively.

Milind Lakkad, EVP and Global Head, Human Resources, TCS, said the company has been in touch with fresh recruits to reassure them that they would be able to join the company. “The process was delayed because of their academic year got delayed.”

TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said the company is selectively opening up lateral hiring given the positive demand environment. However, he did not disclose in which area will the hiring happen or the quantum of hiring.

TCS during its March quarter result said the company is freezing lateral hiring due to uncertainties around COVID-19. However it will honour 40,000 offers handed out to fresh recruits. The recent move to open lateral hiring indicates the demand recovery and the management’s confidence.

These hirings are likely to happen in new age technology areas such as cloud, where there is a huge demand. NG Subramanium, COO, TCS, said majority of the deal closures were in the areas of digital transformation, cloud migration and reimaging customer experience.

For the quarter-ended June, the company saw its total employee count decline by 4,788 to 4.43 lakh. According to Lakkad, this is due to voluntary attrition and the fact that the company has not added new employees in the quarter.

Lakkad said there will be no change in its bench policy and that the company is not looking at retrenching its employees. However, more offshoring is in the pipeline, which has been a challenge due to COVID-19.

It is the last day of the week and it does look like bulls will remain in control for the fifth consecutive week in a row.

The Sensex quickly recouped the losses seen on July 8 thanks to positive global cues. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address at the India Global Week 2020 lifted sentiment further. He said India was already seeing green shoots when it comes to economic recovery.

The broader markets underperformed while the benchmark indices put up a smart show by rallying over a percent each. The Sensex rallied by more than 400 points and the Nifty closed above 10,800 levels.

“Indian equities followed Asian markets as positive economic data from China boosted sentiment. A rise in Chinese iron ore futures and steel prices on the Shanghai Futures Exchange boosted metal stocks in India,” Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said.

Experts told Moneycontrol that the momentum remains strong, but further price action is likely to be guided by the number of fresh COVID-19 infections, and management commentary after the June quarter earnings.

Investors are advised to trade light as the trend could reverse or we could see profit-taking near the 200 Daily Moving Average (DMA), which is placed near 10,900 levels, a technical analyst said.

A similar sentiment was echoed by Khemka. He too advised traders to remain stock specific and look at booking profits at regular intervals.

TCS June quarter results hit by COVID storm: How should one trade the IT bellwether?The country's top IT services major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on July 9 flagged off the June quarter earnings season by reporting a profit of Rs 7,008 crore, down 12.9 percent QoQ, dented by lockdown-led supply and demand challenges.

The year-on-year fall in profit stood at 13.8 percent, which was partially impacted by other income that declined 67.8 percent YoY (down 19 percent QoQ) to Rs 456 crore.

The next big question in front of investors is – what should they do now?

TCS with a market capitalisation of Rs 8 lakh crore is the second-highest among the Indian companies listed on the BSE.

The stock registered a fresh high of Rs 2,302 this week. It has rallied over 50 percent after hitting a bottom of Rs 1,494 in March.

Recently, the counter broke above Rs 2,132 levels, which happens to be the previous tops on the short-term chart. Now, the level of Rs 2,132 has become a strong support for the short-term, a technical analyst said.

“TCS has been facing strong resistance in the Rs 2,200-2,250 zone for the previous five quarters. In Q2 FY21, the stock has shown some sign of breaking out of this upper band of Rs 2,250,” Vinay Rajani, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told Moneycontrol.

Experts told Moneycontrol that it is still a strong technical buy, hence, any dip in the stock post the result could be used to buy. Rajani added that TCS is looking bullish on all technical parameters and the stock should continue to do well in the coming quarters. ""So, every dip should be considered as a buying opportunity by investors.""

Nifty technical outlook for Friday:The Nifty formed a bullish candle on the daily chart on July 8. It closed above the crucial resistance level of 10,800, but 10,900 is likely to be a tough level to breach, experts told Moneycontrol.

Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, recommends investors book profit rather than create fresh longs. ""We see a fresh rally only if we sustain above 11,000 levels.""

The Nifty Bank closed July 9 at 22,907 with a gain of 1.43 percent. The index opened positive and after an early consolidation, it headed towards 23,000 levels in the last hour of the session.

It formed a Bullish candle and negated the effect of Shooting Star candle on a daily scale. “For the last 77 trading sessions, it has seen the highest daily close and has been making a higher top - higher bottom formation,” Chandan Taparia, Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“Now it has to continue to hold above 22,500 to witness an up move towards 23,500. On the downside, key support exists at 22,300 and 22,000 levels,” he added.

TCS is kicking off the June quarter results for Indian IT firms on July 9, followed by Wipro on July 14.

But will June quarter be really the worst for IT companies, considering the impact of COVID-19 outbreak? Going by narratives of analysts and executives, it is most probably going to be a mixed bag.

While the first quarter of FY21 is likely to see a decline, a 5 percent quarter-on-quarter as some brokerages estimate, there is a silver lining — digital. This include cloud and digital transformation projects, which clients are adopting at a much faster pace.

In FY20, IT firms' revenue did not see much of an impact and most of them saw strong order bookings. For TCS, March quarter of FY20 saw the highest ever order booking at $8.9 billion. Its revenue grew 0.9 percent sequentially during Q4 and for the year, the company grew 5.3 percent.

Its peer Infosys grew 4 percent sequentially in Q4 and saw 8.3 percent growth for FY20. HCL Tech’s FY20 revenue grew 13 percent and Wipro’s growth stood at 1.6 percent. For these firms too, the pandemic did not impact order bookings.

However, top IT firms withdrew guidance (TCS does not provide revenue guidance) at the back of uncertainty COVID-19 presented. In addition, in April, analysts and executives Moneycontrol interacted with pointed out that June quarter will bear the brunt of COVID-19, which intensified in the fag end of March.

This included drop in client discretionary spending to the range of 5-15 percent, project cancellations and deferrals and pricing pressures. Infosys and Wipro in their US Security and Exchanges Commission filing said that COVID-19 is likely to impact their revenues and profits.

Some brokerages pointed out that recovery was expected from September while others said recovery won't happen before January 2021.

The verticals that saw the highest impact were travel and hospitality manufacturing and retail whereas healthcare and communication will see minimal impact.

Tech spends continue to happen in banking and financial services and insurance, one of the largest revenue generator for IT firms. However they are now facing deferred loan payments and insurance sector is compelled to charge lower premiums in some categories, pointed out Nandan Nilekani, chairman, Infosys, during the recently concluded AGM.

The pandemic apart, slowdown in developed markets such as the US, UK and Europe will not help either, resulting in tepid Q1 results.

But if the recent Accenture Q3 FY20 results are anything to go by, the situation could be better than anticipated. The largest IT services major reported 1.3 percent year-on-year growth led by healthcare and public services with strong order booking.

The firms high exposure to digital (close to 70 percent) also helped, according to a brokerage reports.

Though it might not apply for Indian IT service providers, recent commentary by executives is encouraging.

Speaking at the 39th Annual General Meeting that was held virtually, Salil Parekh, CEO, Infosys, said in April, the company anticipated business impact in deal closures and longer decision cycles at the back of the pandemic.

""However, the business impact is less than what we had envisaged in April since many of the economies opened up with strong government fiscal monetary support. We have not seen large scale cancellations. Overall we see increase move to digital and we are assisting them more and more in this regard,"" Parekh said.

This could reflect in other companies' results too with Wipro, HCL Tech and TCS well-poised to tackle the pandemic, analysts point out.

Shares of IT players Wipro, TCS, Mindtree and Infosys ended in the red on June 22 when reports made rounds that the US may ban non-immigrant visas such as H-1B.

US President Donald Trump has confirmed that a new executive order that bans non-immigrant visas such as H-1B can be expected in the next couple of days.

The visas that would be the most impacted include skilled non-immigrant visa such as H-1B and L-1 and temporary worker visa for unskilled workers H-2B. Other visas that could be affected are J-1 (research scholars) and Optional Training Programme, where fresh graduates can seek employment in the US for up to three years under their student visa.

As per media reports, the impact for each of these visa could be of varying degrees, with H-1B and L-1 seeing the highest impact. There are about 4 lakh H-1B visa holders and about one lakh L-1 visa holders in the US from India.

Impact on IT players

The clamour for a curb on such visas has gained momentum after the US employment rates saw drastic falls.

The unemployment rate of the US for April was 14.7 percent, which was the highest since 1948. With the addition of 2.5 million jobs, the monthly rate dropped to 13.3 percent for May.

The economy had lost 22.1 million jobs in March and April when most parts of the US were under lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak. In May, some businesses have reopened and rehiring of workers has picked up. Trump had described the numbers as an affirmation of the good work his adminstration is doing.

Experts believe a ban on the H-1B visa may not have a significant impact on IT players as they have already hedged against that.

""It is more of pre-election rhetoric and won't have much impact on IT players since they have already hedged against that so it will have the marginal effect,"" said Sanjiv Bhasin, Director at IIFL Securities.

""Today the IT stocks are weak because a lot of buying is happening in banking and mid-cap stocks so money is probably rotating,"" Bhasin said.

COVID-19 has triggered a sort of makeover of the IT business model in India. Experts point out that work from home has become the new norm and major companies in India are planning to make 75 percent of its workforce working remotely by 2025. These shifts in models could bring savings for IT companies going ahead as there will be a reduction in travel, admin and real estate cost.

""IT spending is estimated to decline by 8 percent in 2020 against a 5.8 percent growth forecasted earlier by Gartner as the focus will turn to cost reduction. A broad-based recovery is expected in the latter half of FY21 powered by spending in healthcare, insurance and education segments. Given positive prospects and stability in business we remain positive on the sector for the long-term,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

There may be some underperformance by IT players owing to the pandemic and the sector s likely to see sunny days after the pandemic is over.

""IT companies are cash-rich and market-oriented. They can innovate and acquire. Rupee's weakness will be a hedge against them but there could be slightly market underperformers given that the market is now looking at a high beta rally. We will see better business once we are past this pandemic. We are very bullish on Tech Mahindra, Mindtree and Wipro at this point in time,"" Bhasin of IIFL said.

Tata Consultancy Services and customer engagement software firm Freshworks partner to build and market end-user and employee experience tools for global consumers.

These tools will be built on Freshworks' cloud platform. These tool include new age marketing, sales, support, customer success, and IT service management solutions, according to a statement.

TCS’ across industry domain strength will enable Freshworks to provide enterprise customers with cloud solutions. On the other hand, with Freshworks, businesses can unify all customer touchpoints.

“Gone are the days when digital transformation projects took months to complete and years to deliver value. With cloud software like Freshworks, implementation could take as little as a few weeks and businesses will be able to see immediate benefits,” said Sidharth Malik, Chief Revenue Officer, Freshworks.

This is a first of a kind partnership between an Indian SaaS firm and IT major such as TCS. It comes at the back of COVID-19 where tech firms are looking to venture into newer business models as its traditional businesses take a hit.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Given the pace at which cloud is being adopted, companies are partnering with cloud computing firms and offering their products and services on these cloud platforms to customers.

Recent times have also seem more cloud partnerships with companies like IBM and AWS. Infosys was the first systems integrator to collaborate with IBM to help its clients migrate to cloud in early March. Recently, Wipro too collaborated with the firm.

The partnership is aimed at helping their clients migrate to hybrid cloud, a cloud computing environment that uses a blend of on-premise infrastructure and private and public cloud services.

Lingraju Sawkar, General Manager - Global Technology Services, IBM India, told Moneycontrol that after big firms such as Infosys and Wipro, they are seeing greater adoption from smaller system integrators as well.",583,0.8772896975278854

In his reply to the Tatas' petition challenging his reinstatement by the NCLAT last December, Mistry also demands that group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata should reimburse all the expenses to Tata Sons since his departure in December 2012 in keeping with best global governance standards.

Early January, the Tatas challenged the December 18, 2019, order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in the Supreme Court, which had stayed the order. Then the apex court on May 29 began hearing on the case and asked all parties concerned to submit their replies within four weeks.

The Mistry family firms filed replies in response to Tatas' affidavits on Friday. PTI has seen the copy of the same.

Mistry was unceremoniously removed as the chairman of Tata Sons on October 24, 2016, in a boardroom coup offering no reason. But later in select press statements the group had claimed that Mistry was removed primarily for his non-performance and claimed that Tata Sons was in loss under his watch.

But, according to Mistry, the loss numbers were arrived at by excluding the huge dividend that the group cash-cow TCS was paying, which was averaging at over 85 per cent annually.

""The Tatas had sought to exclude the dividends from TCS to arrive at operating profit in a bid to discredit my performance. Applying the same yardstick, the adjusted profit after tax (excluding profit from TCS) stood at a negative Rs 13,000 crore in 2019 for the Tata Group, which is the worst loss in three decades,” Mistry says in his replies to the Supreme Court.

He also says Tata Sons had a 282 per cent increase in operating losses in 2019 at Rs 2,100 crore, up from around Rs 550 crore in 2016 and blames it for “the abysmal performance in recent years to legacy issues”.

Mistry also questions the belated claim by the Tatas that his inexplicable removal was due to lack of performance, pointing to the unequivocal endorsement of his performance by the nomination & remuneration committee which was duly approved by the board just weeks before his dramatic removal.

Emphasising that his removal had nothing to do with his performance, Mistry's reply highlights that the Tata Group had annually outperformed the Sensex by 5 percent in terms of market capitalisation when he was the chairman.

Mistry also says the group companies had logged in 34.6 per cent growth in annual net income in the first three years of his tenure and a 100 per cent rise in the patent filings, all leading to a USD 5 billion gain in brand value.

The plea also seeks full disclosure of the expenses of Ratan Tata's office as these are related party transactions.

""It was hoped that in keeping with the global best practices in corporate governance, Tata would reimburse his expenses over the past five years as was done by Jack Welch, the chairman emeritus of GE, reimbursed all his expenses to the company.""

Post-Mistry, the Tata Group's debt rose by Rs 80,740 crore in just two years compared to Rs 69,877 crore in the previous four years when he was the chairman.

The conversion of Tata Sons into a private limited company would also cause the cost of debt to increase, he says, adding the standalone borrowing cost of Tata Sons jumped 92 per cent to Rs 2,776 crore in 2019 from Rs 1,453 crore in 2016.

Similarly, employee expenses in the first three years of his chairmanship rose only by Rs 96 crore, which under the new management jumped by Rs 210 crore over a similar timeframe.

He also notes that the company has seen huge value erosion of the investments when Tata was the chairman. In the past three years, Tata Sons invested about Rs 67,000 crore in portfolio companies but these investments have lost Rs 40,000 crore of the invested value.

Though most of it was due to telecom ventures, the value of the listed non-telecom investments lost 23 per cent to Rs 16,243 crore, while during the same period the Sensex rallied 27 per cent, underperforming the index by 50 per cent.

Mistry also says when Tata was the chairman, the group had no proper investment strategy and that no strategy document ever presented to the board during his tenure.

“All that one saw was mere a set of ill-conceived global acquisition and bad decisions on choice telecom technology platforms, and other business decisions all led to the largest value destruction in Indian corporate history.

""These prejudicial actions led to the dividend yield from Tata Sons falling from around 0.26 per cent in 2005, the first year of the listing of TCS, to a paltry 0.06 per cent in 2019, when dividend yield of Sensex companies was around 1.4 per cent,” he says.

Seeking to hold the trustees of the dozen-odd Tata Trusts responsible for the mess at the group now, Mistry says he has evidence to prove that some trustees were involved in all major decisions and the same led to other shareholders getting negatively impacted. ""Its time the trustees are held accountable.”",893,-0.6305760524489663

For the 81-year-old Bhubaneswar resident, the annual general meeting (AGM) of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is an event he marks on his calendar. An investor in India’s biggest IT firm, he has been travelling 1,350 km to Mumbai for the last 20 years to be part of the proceedings.

But this year, instead of packing a suitcase, the octogenarian, who didn't wish to be identified, had to rush to get himself an internet connection to participate in TCS’ 25th AGM held on June 11. The AGM was held virtually, a first for India, as coronavirus outbreak restricts travel, movement of people and big gatherings.

“He got the internet connection just so he can join the AGM,” said Baibhav Mishra, another investor and a neighbour who helped the senior citizen with the process.

For 26-year-old Mishra, it was convenient and a good experience. According to him, virtual AGMs are efficient and save money.

Gaurav Pingle, a company secretary, couldn’t agree more. Describing the experience as sophisticated, he said, “For me, it was like being in physical AGMs.”

The same, however, cannot be said of the older investors, the majority of whom are not comfortable with technology. Signing up can be task in itself for them.

One has to go to the National Securities Depository's e-voting site and sign in using an ID and a password. After signing in, the investor is taken to the Webex link, where the meeting is hosted.

“While it is fairly a straight forward process, tell me how many people actually remember their ID and password?” asked another investor. “Many would probably give up in the middle.”

While enough time was given to shareholders to ask questions just like in physical AGMs, Sudha Jhunjhunwala tweeted that took a lot of patience from the management to listen to questions due to poor connectivity.

A 55-year-old investor complained that he was unable to ask questions as the connectivity was poor.

These glitches, say experts, are expected, given that it is first such attempt. Pingle was optimistic and said things would get smoother as people will get used to it.

Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran on Thursday said the world's dependency on China as the single sourcing market will reduce in the post-coronavirus future, which presents an opportunity for India. Speaking at the $110-billion group's cash cow TCS' annual general meeting -- the first shareholder meet to be conducted virtually because of the COVID-19 crisis -- Chandrasekaran said the technology world is moving to work from home (WFH) and the country's largest software exporter will also follow the trend.

The coronavirus pandemic, which originated in China, has forced companies the world over to rethink their reliance on the Chinese supply chain. Simultaneously, the constant flaring up of trade tensions has also meant that the world cannot depend on a single market.

""The opportunity does exist (for India). It is not only a question of a shift, but that of dependency on a single market which will reduce. India will definitely have an opportunity to participate,"" Chandrasekaran said, replying to a shareholder query.

He added that TCS has presence in China along with 50 other countries and uses its employees there for both domestic projects and also to deliver work globally.

With many shareholders keen to know about the benefits of working from home, Chandrasekaran said at present it is about expenditure in making the shift. He also made it clear that the post-coronavirus future will see a larger number of people working from home.

Replying to queries centred on media reports of only 25 per cent of employees working from its offices, he called it a ""guesstimate"", saying a specific number cannot be given, but directionally, it is clear that the staff's reliance on working from development centres will reduce.

""We are seeing this as a trend and making significant investments,"" he said, adding it is not just about connectivity and computer peripherals, but also about ensuring that all the necessary protocols on the security front are followed.

There was also a revenue loss because of the shift and the same has been absorbed in the March quarter, he said.

In his presentation to shareholders earlier, TCS Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Rajesh Gopinathan said 96 per cent of the over 4.5 lakh employees of the company are now working from home and the productivity, both from deadlines and quality perspective, has not been impacted.

Chandrasekaran said over the last few months since the onset of the crisis, the company has moved all its engagement processes with employees and shareholders online. It is also conducting virtual townhalls and off-sites for employees.

On the business front, he said the last two months have seen intense deal negotiations and closures as well, but declined to give a clear answer on pricing power.

Its largest revenue segment of banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) is doing ""fine"" with lots of deals and negotiations over the last two months, and the company does not anticipate any shock from that segment, Chandrasekaran said.

He said the healthcare and pharma segment, where TCS has a presence, will grow in the current period.

Replying to queries on acquisitions, he said the company will be very selective and will not acquire only for expanding its revenue. Synergies are very important while assessing a deal, he added.

From a domestic perspective, he said the contraction in GDP growth will not impact its turnover because of the low reliance on revenues from India. Only up to 2 per cent of BFSI revenues comes from India, he noted.

He said TCS has not invested in any electoral bonds in FY20 and the investments were done only in the previous fiscal year.

On the COVID-19 relief front, Chandrasekaran said TCS has built a hospital in Kerala and installed beds and wards in hospitals in Mumbai, adding that lack of land means it cannot build a new facility in the financial capital.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is well poised to lead the transformation post COVID-19 on the back of the investments that the company has made in digital over years, its Chairman N Chandrasekaran said.

Speaking to investors virtually on June 11 at TCS’ 25th Annual General Meeting, he said that the sharp shift in consumer preferences at the back of COVID-19 has now forced enterprises to significantly accelerate their digital transformation initiatives.

Many sectors are now adopting digital channels, which were once secondary and “nice-to-have” options have now become priority.

“This is the transformation that we spoke of five years ago when we said ‘Default is Digital’,” Chandrasekaran said. In the post pandemic world, technology will play an even greater role in helping enterprises adapt to new normal, which the company is more than capable of leading.

In addition, within TCS, it has been able to shift to work from home mode for 90 percent of its 4.5 lakh employees in a short time. The new operating model Secure Borderless Workspaces helped employees keep track of deliverables in a safe and secure manner.

However despite the shift, COVID-19 did impact company’s performance. Chandrasekaran said that the pandemic reversed the positive momentum the company had started seeing in some of the biggest verticals in the first half of the quarter.

As more people work from home, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) sees an increase in demand for its artificial intelligence product Ignio.

Ignio neared the $100 million mark in revenue in FY20, TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said, as quoted by The Economic Times.

In 2018-19, Ignio recorded a revenue of over $60 million, and $31 million in FY18.

""We had hoped that it (revenue from Ignio) will cross $100 million this year (FY20) but it's just short of it. It is still doing quite well,"" Gopinathan said.

Ignio, a part of TCS-owned Digitate, helps companies identify potential system failures.

""Its relevance will increase significantly as we go into a distributed operating model,"" the TCS CEO said.

In India, Ignio competes with Infosys' NIA and Wipro's Holmes. Globally, IBM's Watson has the largest market share, followed by Microsoft and Google's offerings.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

While Wipro CEO Abidali Z Neemuchwala saw his compensation rise 11.8 percent to $4.42 million (about Rs 33.38 crore) in fiscal 2020 from the previous year.

In his note to shareholders in the annual report, Infosys CEO Parekh said the company will closely monitor the impact of the pandemic as the market and client activity evolve.

""We can already see several European countries and US states starting to re-open. We see stability and expansion in our work in the global telecommunications, high technology and life sciences industries,"" he said.

Parekh noted that while methods like wearing masks, regular hand washing, and keeping safe distance help in increasing individual safety, the critical medical milestones of therapeutic and vaccine solutions are in the future.

""We remain extremely focussed on the needs of our clients in this environment and even more ready to expand our support to our clients as the world collectively emerges from the unprecedented situation,"" he said.

Nilekani, in his address, also emphasised that the post-cloud era – characterised by increasingly intelligent, autonomous and self-healing digital infrastructure – is bringing the industry the opportunity to do more.

""Our strong balance sheet, great growth momentum, scaled digital systems for our people to deliver collaboratively and an executive management team relentlessly focussed on executing our digital strategy, uniquely position Infosys to deal with the unprecedented challenges of these times and help our clients navigate to the next normal,"" he added.

In the FY20 annual report, Milind Lakkad, Chief Human Resources Officer, TCS, said that with teams working from home, in-person interactions are now replaced with virtual collaboration and has made physical location irrelevant. “This virtualisation blurs the traditional divide between onsite and offshore,” he added.

This would mean that traveling to onsite locations, particularly for initial transitions and knowledge transfer, potentially reducing the visa dependency.

This comes at the back of TCS’ Vision 25x25 model. TCS expects that by 2025, 25 percent of the workforce will have to work out of office and for not more than 25 percent of the time. This was made possible through its new operating model Secure Borderless Workspaces (SBWS).

SBWS is an agile location agnostic operating model that allows the company to support mission critical operations and transformational projects seamlessly. Currently close to 90 percent of the employees are working from home and TCS is not in a hurry to bring people back to work.

“In the longer term, it is possible that project teams will be seen as part of a virtualised talent cloud and provisioned for in the same way that we provision for compute power or storage today, he added.

In the last few years, the company has brought down the use of work visas by stepping up its localisation efforts. The company has hired close to 20,000 employees in the last five years. For short-term projects, the company has been using subcontractors.

“All this has brought down our use of work visas to a small fraction of what it used to be five years ago, de-risking our business significantly,” Lakkad said. The company has also managed to reduce the need for co-location with greater use of managed services contracting models.

“Looking into the future, as I mentioned earlier, the virtualisation of many activities with SBWS will reduce the need for travel and co-location even further,” he said in the report.

Will it impact deal closures?

V Ramakrishnan, CFO, TCS, it might not impact deal closures for couple of reasons. For one, the company was able to close a large, multi-million dollar deal in end-March, entirely virtually, while both parties were under lockdown. In addition travel restriction has impacted the entire ecosystem and not just TCS.

Ramakrishnan pointed out that the post-pandemic world will see more and more activities that previously involved in-person interactions go virtual, including the sales process.

The Finance Minister has postponed the deadline for filing income tax returns (ITR) for the previous financial year, to November 30, 2020 from July 31 earlier.

The government has also reduced the tax deduction at source (TDS) and tax collection at source (TCS) rates, so that taxpayers have more funds at their disposal. The rates for non-salaried payments to residents have been reduced by 1.25-7.5 percentage points depending on the category of deduction.

Reduced rates

“The reduction in TDS and TCS rates for non-salaried payments and reduction in EPF contribution rates will further increase cash in hand for taxpayers, leading to a consequent boost in demand, setting the economy rolling,” says Archit Gupta, Founder, and CEO, ClearTax.

Dr Suresh Surana, founder of tax consultancy RSM India, says, “The reduction in TDS and TCS rates would affect payment to contractors (1-2 per cent), rents (10-15 per cent), brokerage, dividends too (as they are tax deductible starting this year) and interest payment.”

The government has said that this overall relief of Rs 50,000 crores of liquidity through TDS/TCS rate reduction would be applicable from May 14, 2020 up to March 31, 2021.

“However, the government has only offered a deferment in tax liability by reducing the TDS and TCS rates. TDS is not the final tax liability. The total tax liability will in no way come down and hence this is a cashflow benefit and not absolute money in the pocket,” Surana points out.

So, for example, you would have to declare the entire interest income earned on your FDs in your returns and pay tax on that at your slab, even though TDS rates may be lower.

So, remember that a lower TDS rate would be collected while making payments to you, but the tax would have to be borne while filing returns. So, you merely get a leeway of time.

Assessment dates postponed

The date of assessments, which were getting barred on September 30, 2020, would now get barred on December 31, 2020 and similarly the ones expiring on March 31, 2020 would get barred on September 30, 2020. So, those tax returns which could come under scrutiny have been extended as per the dates mentioned. So, make sure you preserve your tax proofs and donation receipts for the additional period.

An extension has been granted for making payment under the Vivad se Vishwas scheme, without the additional penalty amount. One can pay the taxes under dispute at various levels in this settlement window up to December 31, 2020.",421,0.041909635066986084

Sophisticated quality inspection of wafers during the semiconductor manufacturing process is essential to detect and classify defects early and accurately, as well as improve quality, TCS said. Several companies still run manual inspections that rely heavily on human expertise.

This makes the process prone to errors and limits manufacturing throughput. TCS WaferWise leverages custom AI models to automatically detect and classify anomalies by analysing nano-scale images generated during the semiconductor manufacturing process, it said.

This decline is despite the momentum the firms saw in the first half of the year. First quarter of FY20 saw record hiring in the IT sector. Business Standard reported that close to 85,000 freshers were hired in Q4 FY19, the highest in a single quarter in the last six years.

Take for instance the top three firms. For FY19, TCS hired 30,000 freshers, its highest in the last five years in Q1. Infosys handed out more than 34,000 offers to both freshers and laterals between April and December 2019. Wipro said it had hired 9,000 freshers between April and September 2019 and about 12,000 in FY20.

IT staffers told Moneycontrol that the worst was over and the numbers reflect the confidence the companies have in terms of new age projects though the numbers will never be as huge as a decade ago. Rituparna Chakroborty, co-founder, Teamlease, an IT staffing firm, said in an earlier interaction that hiring will never be in mass numbers as it had been a decade back, but more niche.

In its early days, IT firms recruited freshers in thousands from campuses. However, hiring now has become more or less niche as firms are looking for people with new age skills such as cloud, AI and machine learning.

Grim hiring outlook for FY21Given the novel coronavirus pandemic, hiring is likely to dip further in FY21. All three IT companies will not have any new hires. Infosys, Wipro and TCS said that they would honour all the offers that has been given out so far in FY21. TCS has issued 40,000 offers and Infosys 35,000.

Wipro will defer on-boarding of freshers, whereas TCS and Infosys will start on-boarding after the students graduate. The graduation will likely to be pushed to July as the final year exams have been postponed due to COVID-19.",714,-0.05756402015686035

IT companies are staring at falling spends and mounting working capital and it could take more than two quarters to recover from the coronavirus-induced crisis, feel industry watchers.

TCS results and the leadership commentary reflected the same.

However, the IT major saw record deal wins and was able to quickly secure work from home for more than 90 percent of its workforce. There are close to 4.5 lakh employees in TCS.

The management said the actual impact will be felt in the June quarter as clients cut down on spending, discounts on existing contracts and slump in demand.

For the IT majors, the crisis mimics the global financial crisis of 2008.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

""We expect this to be worse than the global financial crisis,"" said Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO, TCS, while announcing the results.

The company reported $22,030 million in terms of revenue, up 5.34 percent, from FY19. Last time the company reported similar growth was back in FY10, during global financial crisis.

However, Gopinathan said he expects the demand recovery to start from Q3 after the peak impact in Q1. ""We expect Q3 and Q4 of FY21 to be what we saw in Q3 and Q4 of FY20,"" he said. The company’s revenue at the end of December 2019 quarter was $5586 million.

But it is surprising to see that the company is expecting a rebound in Q3 prospects despite operating in a tough environment.

Also Read: What should investors do with TCS stock post Q4: buy, sell or hold?

Most analysts Moneycontrol spoke to pointed out that growth revival in Q3 is a steep ask.

The crisis could not have come at a worse time. The company saw single digital growth in Q2 and Q3 due to macros such as Brexit and softness in the banking and financial markets, the largest revenue generator for the company. It accounts for about 30 percent of overall revenue.

Like Gopinathan said during the results announcement, the COVID-19 impact is more broad-based and has affected all sectors invariably. Aviation, manufacturing, retail, banking and even healthcare. While the healthcare sector is seeing traction, Gopinathan raised concerns about all activities including operations postponed except COVID-19 and it is likely to impact the business.

So getting back to Q3 growth of 6-7 percent growth is easier said than done. Unlike 2008, there is no clarity on how long the situation could prolong nor can you account for behavourial changes of customers.

According to an IT industry veteran, recovery may begin from Q3 but it will be at least 18 months or longer before IT sector can get back to normalcy and that includes TCS as well.

Speaking on the quarter gone by, Gopinathan said TCS went from an integrated delivery model to a dispersed delivery model. ""In the new operational model, more than 90 percent of TCS employees are able to work from home. Despite this, we maintained our execution capability and security processes."" The ability to seamlessly operate is one of the biggest positive takeaway from this phase, he added.

Comparing COVID-19 with the global financial crisis of 2008, he said the impact of the former has been more broad-based.

Gopinathan feels the peak of coronavirus impact is likely to felt in Q2 FY21. ""We should be able to get back to where we were in Q3 FY20 by Q3 FY21.""

Despite the near-term challenges, TCS has been able to maintain profitability and maintained its long-term margin guidance at 26-28 percent, he added.

In terms of geographies, the management expects US to continue to remain weak in the near term.

The pandemic has caused a number of firms to trip their workforce and to defer increments and promotions. On April 15, Wipro said will go slow on hiring and defer on-boarding in FY21 due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The company went slow on on-boarding in Q4 FY20 as well, resulting in decline in its headcount by 4,500. It added that employees are likely to face deferment in hikes and promotions.

He did mention that TCS will not offer any salary increments at this point in time, but added: ""Promotions will happen depending on business performance.""

TCS, he said, will honour all 40,000 offers made on campus, adding that the company will bring them onboard from Q2 and Q3.

But more than the numbers, the market will keenly observe the implications of the coronavirus outbreak on the business, the outlook for FY21E and commentary on client discretionary spending and pricing pressure.

According to ICICI Direct, COVID-19 is impacting the economy, with IT companies also expected to feel the heat. COVID-19 is the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

""We expect constant currency revenues to grow 0.5 percent sequentially (assuming 1 percent hit due to impact from COVID-19) mainly on the back of lockdown (in India and many other countries) and slower client- decision making led by lower discretionary spends,"" ICICI Direct said.

The brokerage added that the full impact of COVID-19 would be visible in Q1FY21E.

""Cross currency would act as a headwind of 10 bps leading to dollar revenue growth of 0.4 percent QoQ to $5,608 million. Rupee revenue growth is expected to grow 2 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to Rs 40,644 crore,"" ICICI Direct said.

The brokerage expects TCS' EBIT margins to remain flat QoQ to 25 percent, mainly aided by rupee depreciation and lower travel costs.

The estimates of Kotak Institutional Equities show TCS' CC (constant currency) revenue growth of 0.6 percent QoQ and 4.9 percent YoY.

""Our estimates for TCS bake in 1 percent hit from missed billings and lockdowns in India and developed markets in the last two weeks of March 2020. Without the COVID-19 hit, our revenue growth assumption would have been 1.6 percent QoQ in CC,"" Kotak said.

Kotak expects stable margins for TCS as the impact of lower billing due to COVID-19 disruptions will be offset by rupee depreciation and lower variable compensation payout.

""We note that March 2019 quarter had a one-time impact of 60 bps from contribution to electoral bonds. We expect record bookings despite disruptions in the second half of March. Robust bookings will be courtesy mega deals signed with Phoenix Group and $1.5 bn deal with Walgreen Boots,"" Kotak said.

Kotak believes the following 5 points will be in focus when TCS releases its numbers:

(1) Work from home -- focus will be on the percentage of employees, infrastructure readiness and client permissions.

(2) Longer-term implications on business from the current lockdown.

(3) Revenue and margin outlook for FY2021E in light of a potential recession.

(4) Nature and persistence of spending cuts and assumptions of normalization of growth, if any.

(5) Margin levers in light of potential pricing pressure. Kotak said it does not expect any change to capital allocation policy, nonetheless, this will be an area of focus.

Brokerage firm Sharekhan by BNP Paribas expects CC revenue growth of 4.8 percent YoY owing to supply disruption, lower billing and utlisation in the wake of coronavirus outbreak.

EBIT margin is expected to remain flat despite lower billing and utilisation decline due to COVID-19 disruption, offset by rupee depreciation, lower variable pays and lower travelling expense. Net profit is expected to grow by 1.3 percent QoQ during the quarter, said the brokerage.

Indian banking system may be staring at big challenges, but is at the cusp of huge growth in the next decade, a top TCS executive said.

There are very few industries which can boast of a 15 per cent growth on a yearly basis for ten years, TCS chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan said, conceding that this makes him envious of the business.

“In many ways, you are where Indian IT sector was 20 years ago, looking at a huge opportunity,” Gopinathan said, speaking at a technology awards of banking industry lobby IBA here late in the evening.

There are very few businesses globally where one can confidently speak about a 15 per cent yearly growth over a decade, he said.

Gopinathan acknowledged that there will be challenges in the process but exuded confidence in the Indian banking sector meeting those.

The sector has moved mountains silently till now, he said, noting its work on a slew of aspects like taking banking services to the grassroots and connecting a billion people.

He said Indian banking will have to play an important role for the country to achieve the USD 5 trillion GDP target set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi by FY2025.

It can be noted that the Indian banking system is currently plagued with the problem of huge pile of non-performing loans which are nearly 10 per cent of all the assets, and also facing sluggish credit growth.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported a 1 percent sequential growth in its Q3FY20 profit and clocked revenues worth Rs 39,854 crore, a QoQ growth of 2.25 percent .

The dollar revenue growth for the quarter stood at 1.25 percent and the same in constant currency stoof at 0.3 percent QoQ, which was lower than street's estimates of 1 percent.

The country's largest IT company won deals worth $6 billion during the quarter that ended in December 2019, taking the total of its 9-month deals to $18 billion.

Here are key highlights from TCS' conference call by Narnolia Financial Advisors:

Management participants: Rajesh Gopinathan - CEO and MD, NG Subramaniam - COO, V Ramakrishnan - CFO, Milind Lakkad - Global Head, Human Resources.

The company is closely monitoring the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) service vertical where they saw some tightening of its budget from the business of the year. Despite that, the company saw strong deal closures distributed across verticals and geography. This quarter, the company closed $1.8 billion TCV. The company added 20 new logos in BFSI.

In the short term, the resultant deflation is pulling down TCS' growth in the BFSI segment. However, in seven quarters, it grew materially by 200 percentage points relative to the market share of top six providers. This gives confidence over TCS' position to continue to participate in the demand turnaround in the medium to long term.

In the retail vertical, the company is growing substantially in the UK and Europe. Headwinds are coming from large retailers in US, as some going through financial stress. The company is confident of headwinds bottoming out soon. The momentum will be sustainable for growth in UK and Europe.

Europe continued to outperform for the company while UK on other hand decelerated sharply in the quarter due to Brexit anxieties. BFSI and retail headwinds also caused deceleration of US.

Ignio, TCS' cognitive automation product, has 10 new wins, and 7 went live during the quarter. Ignio's channel partner is also progressing well with 2 new partners on board this quarter, bringing the total number to 6.

TCS Banc has six new wins, and eight went live in Q3. Out of the six wins, two were in the asset services platform, and the remaining four were in areas of core banking, securities trading and securities processing.

The company focused on execution in Q3. With improved utilization and some support from currency, the company managed to expand the operating margin by 100 bps sequentially to 25 percent in Q3.

Going ahead, currency fluctuation can be a headwind while expanding the base of the pyramid to moderate intake at the mid level, and hiring fresher's ongoing basis will benefit margins. Also, higher growth will also play as significant benefit to margins.

Tata Consultancy Services, the country's largest IT services company, January 17 registered a 0.94 percent sequential growth (up 0.16 percent YoY) in third quarter net profit at Rs 8,118 crore, impacted by lower other income (down 40 percent QoQ).

Constant currency revenue growth for the quarter slowed down further for third consecutive quarter, coming in at 6.8 percent YoY against 8.4 percent in September quarter and 12.1 percent in December quarter 2018.

IT services attrition rate for the quarter stood at 12.2 percent.

While addressing press conference, N Ganapathy Subramaniam, Chief Operating Officer & Executive Director said the client mood has been swinging based on trade war discussion.

IT heavyweight Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will release its December quarter (Q3) scorecard on January 17. Analysts expect the numbers to be tepid.

While the numbers will show the hits and misses during Q3FY20, investors will focus on - demand from impacted BFS and retail verticals; the impact on new outsourcing deals in a US Presidential election year; overall IT budgets and spending outlook; TCV of deals; pipeline of large deals; and measures taken to mitigate supply-side pressures in the US.

Domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects a softer BFSI and retail numbers for TCS for the December quarter. The brokerage is of the view that better utilisation and rupee's depreciation will drive margins.

For Q3FY20, Motilal Oswal expects a 2.3 percent year-on-year (YoY) or 3.3 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) rise in the PAT for TCS to the tune of Rs 8,305 crore.

""Revenue may see a rise of 6.6 percent YoY to Rs 39,788.5 crore. In the dollar terms, the revenue may come at $5,588 million. EBITDA margin may come at 27.1 percent,"" Motilal Oswal said in a report.

On the other hand, brokerage firm Kotak Securities expects a 1.5 percent YoY increase in reported PAT for TCS at Rs 8,224.3 crore for Q3.

Kotak's estimates show an 11 bps YoY fall in EBITDA margin percentage at 26.9, while net sales or revenue may come to the tune of Rs 39,864.4 core, up 6.8 percent YoY and 2.3 percent QoQ.

""We expect revenue growth to moderate to 6.8 percent in constant currency (CC) basis on YoY comparison due to slowdown in BFS and retail and high base of the previous year. On a sequential basis, we expected a muted revenue growth of 0.8 percent,"" said Kotak Securities.

""CC tailwind on a sequential basis is 60 bps, while we expect headwind of 30 bps on YoY comparison. Rupee depreciation, the cross-currency tailwind of 60 bps and an increase in employee utilisation rate will contribute to a sequential increase in EBIT margin,"" the brokerage said.

Kotak expects a YoY decline in margin, while other income may decline sequentially to Rs 975 crore from Rs 1,170 crore in Q2FY20 due to the payout of over Rs 20,000 crore in the form of dividend and lower forex gain.

As per Kotak Securities, the lacklustre Q3 show of TCS can be attributed to the continued weakness in European banking and capital market clients in the US and to the account-specific challenges in retail vertical also.

Another brokerage firm Edelweiss Securities expects a 7.4 percent YoY and 2.9 percent QoQ rise in TCS' Q3 revenue to the tune of Rs 40,110.8 crore.

""After a slow H1FY20, We expect TCS to deliver 1.7 percent CC revenue growth, whereas a strong GBP (up 4 percent QoQ against USD) should help lift USD revenue growth rate by 40bps,"" Edelweiss said.

""Gains from a weak rupee and operational rigour should help TCS expand margins by 40 bps QoQ. We will be monitoring commentary on the macro environment and demand in BFSI & retail,"" Edelweiss added.

Top five technology companies are expected to report sequential constant currency revenue growth of 0.8-2 percent each in the third quarter of financial year 2020, brokerages say.

The October-December quarter is seasonally weak for the IT companies due to furloughs and holidays in the US.

Appreciation of GBP against the US dollar is likely to be a cross-currency (CC) tailwind which ultimately may support dollar revenue growth that could be around 1-2.3 percent over previous quarter, according to brokerages.

""We expect moderation in revenue growth due to tepid growth in BFSI, retail & manufacturing verticals with higher furloughs & client-specific challenges for few companies,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher which sees tier-1 companies reporting sequential growth between 0.9 percent and 2 percent CC, and 0.5 percent and 3 percent CC in tier-2 in Q3FY20.

Sharekhan also expects top five Indian IT companies to deliver 0.8-2.1 percent QoQ CC revenue growth in Q3FY20.

""Unlike Q3FY19, appreciation of GBP against USD would create cross-currency tailwinds of 20-60 BPS on USD revenue growth, resulting in USD revenue growth of 1.1-2.3 percent QoQ, the brokerage said.

Brokerages expect top five IT companies' margin to be supported by rupee depreciation, but among them, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies are likely to report degrowth in margin QoQ.

""Though depreciation of rupee against USD and GBP would provide margin tailwind to companies on a QoQ basis, margins of HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra are expected to decline on a QoQ basis,"" Sharekhand said.

Edelweiss also said, barring Tech Mahindra and HCL, it expects margins of the other three to rise 40–65 bps QoQ as weak rupee (down 1 percent QoQ against the USD) and operational levers kick in.

Sustained momentum in digital and robust deal pipeline across verticals are likely to underpin strong management commentaries after Q3 earnings, the brokerage said.

Key things to watch out for would be increase in deal sizes & tenures in digital; demand commentary, specifically BFSI & retail; and commentary on the improving geopolitical scenario.

From an operational standpoint, many companies have been struggling to tame high attrition over the previous few quarters. This, along with commentary around onsite supply bottlenecks, will be the key areas of investor focus, Motilal Oswal said.

Most brokerages do not expect any material change in the current guidance of Infosys (9-10 percent CC revenue growth YoY for FY20) and HCL Technologies (15-17 percent YoY).

But they expect moderation in revenue growth in medium term due to US elections, lower tech spending by US and Europe in capital markets & banking sectors, waning impact of US tax reforms and margin headwind.

""We expect Brexit outcome to be negative for Indian IT companies, as when UK will leave EU there will be lot of uncertainties due to transition process which could further result in delay in decision making hurting the IT spending environment,"" Prabhudas Lilladher said.

Despite these headwinds, the demand environment remains healthy, which is evident from the large deal momentum, robust deal pipeline and acceleration in core transformation works by large global enterprises, said Sharekhan which expects operating profitability to remain under pressure owing to elevated attrition, higher onsite expenses, transition costs in large deals, and intense competition.

Nifty IT index gained 0.72 percent during the quarter ended December 2019, underperforming Nifty50 which rallied 6.05 percent in same period.

The underperformance of IT index was due to Infosys whistleblower issue, weak global macro set up, muted spending by US banks, muted performance from european geography, higher impact of furloughs and upcoming election in the US.

Most brokerage houses bet on three stocks - Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies, citing better revenue growth than peers and reasonable valuations.

""We believe companies with the right set of services and capabilities are well placed to capture the opportunities available in the market and are able to deliver growth in CY2020,"" Sharekhan said.

Global financial services company Credit Suisse expects the economic slowdown to continue in 2020.

Earnings may bounce back and investing in ""safe stocks"" should be the prefered strategy for next year, the brokerage said in a report, India Market Strategy, released last week.

“Market performance in CY20 thought would be affected by how FY22 EPS moves—we expect this too to settle at a low to mid-teens growth on the reduced FY21 base. We expect narrow market performance to continue for now, as economic uncertainty continues to push funds into the safe stocks,” said the note.

For 2020, Credit Suisse has shifted to a more concentrated 30-stock portfolio where they have tried to reduce concentration risk by being more overweight on SBI than HDFC Bank.

The global investment bank will stay overweight on financials, telecom, utilities and metals. Pharma and IT also received minor uptick. It has a ‘Market Weight’ on staples and Underweight on discretionary cement, and industrials.

Top 30 stocks in Credit Suisse portfolio include RIL, HDFC Ltd, TCS, HUL, ICICI Bank, ITC, Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Finance, SBI, Tech Mahindra, Coal India, Dabur, Lupin, Chola Finance, ICICI Prudential, and Motherson Sumi.

Credit Suisse also highlighted ""quality bubble"" which is likely to remain inflated for some more time till growth comes back.

The global investment bank in the report highlighted that foreign investors reacted to the weak economic activity levels. FPIs too have been focusing on the top 100 names, though that has been their focus generally.

Almost 76 percent of the FPI holdings are in the Nifty stocks, compared to 66 percent for the domestic institutional holdings. This ratio for DIIs was 56 percent a year back.

As a result, performance is becoming lopsided, driven primarily by a select few large and liquid stocks, with the majority of stocks being 20-30 percent below their all-time highs even though most indexes are close to lifetime highs.

“Till growth uncertainty continues (we expect for another six months), we expect this “quality bubble” to stay inflated and market concentration to remain high,” said the note.

""TCS, Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank each can notch Rs 20 lakh crore in market capitalisation over next few years,"" said Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint Managing Director at Motilal Oswal Financial Services who has been focussing on top quality businesses by top quality managements.

Recently, Reliance Industries crossed Rs 10 lakh crore in market cap and became the most valued company among listed entities after tariff hikes and asset monetisation plans to cut down debt.

""Reliance Industries is very interesting case, invested more than Rs 3 lakh crore in capex in Jio and Retail. The outcome of these things will help the company maintain leadership,"" he said.

Raamdeo feels next five years will be fantastic and in the telecom space, average revenue per user (ARPU) can go from Rs 125 to Rs 250 and 60-70 percent of that goes to EBITDA. Hence, top telecom stocks will rally more from current levels.

TCS retained its second position in the highest market-cap list, followed by the country's second largest private sector lender (by asset size) HDFC Bank. These three stocks together now are valued at more than Rs 25 lakh crore.

HDFC Bank has been growing 20-22 percent consistently as it is very good money deployment machine with strong size while TCS has very low capital intensity business with higher free cash flow, through which they can do wonders.

Raamdeo said the quality of management was a difficult issue to focus on (for e.g. Manpasand Beverages which lost 97 percent of its value from highs due to corporate governance, debt concerns).

He believes tracking every company's accounts is a good way to understand management integrity. ""Satyam is the real example of accounting fraud. Its actual profit margin was 3-4 percent which was inflated to compete with Infosys.""

He said analysts typically focus more on profit & loss statement over balance sheets/cash flow statements, and dishonest accounting typically do debit balancesheets and credit P&Ls. Hence, the important is to focus on fixed assets, apart from free cash flows, he added.

Therefore, he advised buying stocks where managements have highest and unquestionable integrity. In fact, he believes investors should have a forensic mindset to study every company.

He further advised investors to have financials space in the portfolio with 30-40 percent exposure, where he sees private companies including banks, insurance, NBFCs continuing taking market share from public sector companies in coming years.

""Financials will continue to have a large contribution to wealth creation. One should stick with consistently and fastest growing companies,"" Raamdeo said.

Real estate remained one of the biggest industries globally and the government will resolve realty issue also soon, he feels. He sees huge housing demand in the country going ahead.

He said Sensex has hit a multiple of 25x forward earnings and hence, valuations remain very stretched currently.

The BSE Sensex and Nifty traded at around record high levels at the time of publishing this copy, after rising more than 13 percent since September 20 when the government announced the biggest decision of sharp cut in corporate tax rate which brought India to levels of developed nations.

At the closing of December 13, TCS was quoting at Rs 2,070.00 up by Rs 49.10 or 2.43 percent.

It happened as the Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group sold more of its shares in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in the open market on December 12, according to The Times of India.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

Over 71 lakh TCS shares were sold on the NSE and close to 2 lakh shares on the BSE on December 12. It is yet uncertain how much of this was sold specifically by the SP Group.

This is their second such stake sale in December. The group’s Sterling Investment Corporation and Cyrus Investments sold 19.90 lakh shares of TCS in the open market on December 4 and raised Rs 400 crore.

The move is a part of SP’s asset monetisation plan to deal with its Rs 30,000 crore debt.

The stake sale comes at a time when rating agencies have downgraded SP’s debt instruments and its renewable infra company Sterling & Wilson Solar, which has been impacted by the IL&FS debacle. The deadline for the repayment of Sterling’s debt is December 31.",200,

Sterling Investment Corporation and Cyrus Investments sold 19.90 lakh shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares in the open market last week and raised Rs 400 crore for Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group amid its shaky financial situation, reports The Times of India.

Sterling Investment headed by Shapoor Mistry, Chairman of SP Group, and Cyrus Mistry’s Cyrus Investments together held 73.45 lakh TCS shares (0.19 percent). This has now reduced to 53.55 lakh TCS shares, or 0.14 percent, the report noted.

Before the sale, Shapoor and his younger brother Cyrus together held 73.45 lakh TCS shares (or 0.19 percent of TCS equity), via the SP Group’s 18.38 percent stake in Tata Sons. They now own 53.55 lakh TCS shares (0.14 percent).

We expect allocations to move to non-HRITIK stocks in largecaps and into midcaps (having a market cap above Rs 8,000 cr), Vinay Pandit, Head, Institutional Equities, IndiaNivesh, said in an interview to Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts:

Q) It was a historic week for Indian equity markets with gains of nearly 3% for the week ended November 1. What is your view of markets in the coming week? Will the Nifty hit a fresh high or have we topped out?

A) This is in line with our view, where we said that the Nifty will hit new highs around Diwali. Largecap earnings growth has gone up by 15-18 percent, which augurs well for the broader markets and the index earnings.

Two major factors are contributing to this. First, the lower tax rate has averaged out the higher tax provisioning of Q1 over the lower tax for Q2, thereby cutting the tax provisioning for Q2 to 15-18 percent.

Second, the low base effect over the last year’s Q2 is being seen now, especially in auto volumes. We don’t believe that the Nifty has topped out, though multiples may have topped out for certain frontline stocks.

We expect allocations to move to other non-HRITIK stocks (HDFC, RIL, Infosys, TCS, HUL , IndusInd, and Kotak Mahindra Bank) in largecaps and into midcaps (having a market cap above Rs 8,000 cr).

HDFC Life and SBI Life were seen diluting equity and are now in the race to enter the Nifty (free float methodology) potentially replacing Yes Bank/Bharti Infratel.

Q) What is your view of the auto sales numbers for the month of October? Do you think things have bottomed out and can the auto sector be a dark horse in 2020?

A) Auto sales numbers have been encouraging. However, Maruti Suzuki India is still a long way from getting the premium 30x multiples, which it commanded in the past. To get there, it will have to start doing sales volume numbers of 160-170K per month.

However, this will still yield lifetime low margins and ROEs, thereby offering profit-booking opportunity every time it crosses Rs 7,500-7,700. As a house, we have a ‘sell’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 5,700 based on 23x FY21E earnings.

TVS Motor numbers were disappointing on the two-wheeler side. We expect Hero Motors and Bajaj Auto to throw up positive surprises, led by festival season sales, rural demand and strong support to the channel, coupled with a focus on liquidating BS-IV inventory.

Eicher Motors may do well on liquidation of inventory in the system for the quarter. However, competition from Jawa and cannibalising its products portfolio between 500CC & 650 CC, as well as between Classic 350 and Bullet 350, could hamper expectations of incremental volumes.

Exports could throw up major surprises in the coming months as displayed in October data. We expect the pain in CVs (commercial vehicles) to continue for some more time before economic activity picks up significantly while being attractively valued.

The sector witnessed a bottoming out in Jul-Aug’19, and we may see positive spurts on performance for select companies such as Hero Motocorp, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motors.

Q) The last 11 years data suggest that November usually belongs to the bears. The Sensex closed in the red in November in seven of the 11 years. Do you think 2019 will be different?

A) While such data points will always pop up, we believe broader market trends need to be studied. November in the last 11 years has been positive four out of 11 years. At the same time, September, October, and December have been positive 50% of the time. September 2019 was up 6.3% vs September 2018 (-5.6%). October 2019 was up 4.6% vs October 2018 (-5.6%).

November has started on a positive note and can be expected to close on a positive note just like November 2018, led by good festive sales, lower tax rate giving a boost to corporate earnings and the bottoming out scenario in certain sectors.

These kinds of data points are of little relevance to long-term investment strategies and can be easily ignored. Overall earnings performances of most companies have been good for Q2FY20 vs Q2FY19 when there were more misses than hits.

Analysts continue to be conservative on the back of weak expectations for the year, which is a good hidden opportunity to invest for the long-term in quality stocks at low valuations.

Q) Any important events to watch out for in November?

A) While the government has addressed supply-side concerns, the demand-side concerns need to be addressed as well. While not as early as November, we expect rationalisation of tax slabs in the upcoming budget in February 2020, easing out of the Long Term Capital Gains Tax, and improving corporate governance to be the key factors for the market starting next year.

Indian IIP data may disappoint but seems to be bottoming out over there as well. Green offshoots are visible in several beaten-down sectors like autos and auto ancillaries, NBFCs, banking, infrastructure, defence, apparel retail, domestic pharma, among others.

Q) How is the November series likely to pan out for investors? What are the bright spots if we look at the October series rollover data? Which stocks are likely to be on the list of bulls and those that will remain in the grip of the bears?

A) There is money to be made on the table by investing and trading in quality companies. Good companies are offering enough investment opportunities at low valuations on the back of strong performances and quality corporate governance.

Autos (two-wheelers) and auto ancillaries, resolution of banking & NBFC issues, defence ordering, pick-up in retail, and the strong performance by companies in domestic pharma will keep bulls busy, while airlines, telecom, passenger vehicles, capital goods, real estate will keep the bears busy.

We believe that the overall direction of the market is positive now, having seen time as well as an earnings correction across sectors over the last 18 months.

The positive FII inflows seen over the last 10-15 days coupled with continued inflows into mutual funds (as SIPs inflows continue to make lifetime highs) augurs well for overall markets and long-term direction of Indian markets.

Despite being the country's top IT company, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) also has to deal with attrition - an industry phenomena. As per reports, the company will double the salary of those employees who prove that they are 'Hot Talents'.

The company launched the TCS National Qualifier Test (TQNT) in 2018, whereby it made offers to 30,000 freshers that year. Out of these, 1,300 would be given a chance to appear for a more advanced test, a step towards proving that they could be the 'hot talent'.

The main idea behind this test was to bypass the yearly campus hiring process which takes up more time, while trying to bring the industry's top talent into their fold.

Meanwhile, a similar offer incentive is on the table for the company's existing employees as well. Those who have been working with TCS and hold at least three years of experience will also be able to take a shot at doubling their current pay starting in FY20.

But, TCS is not alone in its attempts to retain its best employees. Earlier this week, Wipro announced that it plans to promote nearly 5,000 employees by December this year. This, the firm said, was mainly to check attrition and prepare the company for the future. Employees in the five to eight years experience group would be eligible for these promotions.

Similarly, India's second largest IT major Infosys hired around 6,000 freshers in the quarter ended September this year. It also announced that for FY20, it would hire around 18,000 freshers via campus placements.

This year, the net hiring by these top three IT players went up 59 percent in the September quarter as against that in the June quarter, as per a report by The Hindu BusinessLine. They hired 28,157 employees in Q2FY20 as compared to the 16,687 hired in the quarter before that, the report added.

IT companies are increasingly resorting to new ways to retain crucial talent in their fold, while also working towards upskilling existing employees to train prepare them for the shifting demand in skill set.

Over the years, the industry has witnessed a rise and expansion in digital technologies, a phenomena which gives rise to different requirements in skill sets of employees. Companies are therefore rethinking their existing hiring processes to ensure that they are able to recruit people who have skills in line with the current industry demands.

India's two largest IT companies announced their September quarter earnings, with TCS posting numbers below analyst expectations while Infosys' results matched street estimates.

Infosys reported 2.5 percent sequential growth in Q2 dollar revenue and TCS 0.6 percent, but the deal size was strong for the quarter at $2.8 billion and $6.4 billion respectively.

Analysts are concerned about the full-year double-digit growth for TCS amid headwinds in Europe BFSI segment whereas they turned optimistic about Infosys after it raised the full-year constant-currency revenue guidance again in Q2 to 9-10 percent.

Earnings were mixed, but that does not mean analysts also have mixed opinions on stock. In fact, they advised sticking more to laregcaps (TCS and Infosys) than midcaps in the IT space due to likely strong growth in coming years.

""I am positive on IT sector in the current scenario and expect both Infosys and TCS to give good annual returns in the next couple of years,"" Romesh Tiwari, Head of Research - CapitalAim, told Moneycontrol.

The recently-declared result of TCS was a bit subdued while the Infosys result met market expectations. However, investors should buy into both on dips for a better portfolio returns, Tiwari advised.

He feels IT majors like Infosys and TCS are robust and can provide comparatively-secured returns while returns on midcap IT will be more volatile. So, investors should choose according to their risk appetite.

The major reason behind the advice is the company's digital revenue contribution to topline, which has been increasing. Hence, these two majors are expected to gain lead share though the slowing global economic growth have been hurting the Indian IT companies’ earnings.

Factors like Brexit, Trade War and stringent VISA norms resulted in local hiring in the US and have been impacting the IT companies' growth and margins.

""The concept of rising digitalization has completely changed the dynamics of the IT industry thus, those companies with a large share of the revenue from the digital business are going to benefit most in the coming days. Thus, odds are in favour of large IT companies having a higher share from digital revenue,"" Paras Bothra, President of Equity Research - Ashika Group of Companies, said.

Ajit Mishra, Vice President - Research, Religare Broking, is also positive on Infosys and TCS from the long-term perspective. He recommends buy on the stock on dips.

""We remain constructive on long term growth prospects of the company due to its increased focus on digital business, a rising share of high margin business and strong management,"" he said.

TCS is India’s largest IT company and offers its services to a wide range of industries such as BFSI, manufacturing, Telecom, retail, transportation, and insurance.

It has over 4,20,000 consultants present in over 50 countries. In terms of revenue, 51 percent of its business comes from North America. Mishra believes that the company is well placed to benefit from the increasing demand for offshore IT services seen over the last decade.

Meanwhile, global brokerages had mixed reactions to both companies earnings.

Jefferies has buy call on both stocks but cut target price for Infosys to Rs 915 from Rs 930 and for TCS to Rs 2,300 from Rs 2,500 per share.

""Infosys remains one of the best placed amongst top Tier IT companies and will benefit from the tailwind of large-scale digital transformation,"" the research firm said, adding that TCS will outperform Tier-I peers on growth and margin in the medium term. Weak results could provide a good entry opportunity into a strong long-term franchise.

Citi also maintained buy call on Infosys and sell rating on TCS with target price at Rs 900 and Rs 1,870 per share respectively.

""While the macro is tough, continued momentum/execution should provide comfort for Infosys. Company's positioning as a defensive in India context is good and the stock is one of our big overweights in the India model portfolio,"" the global brokerage said.

Slowdown signs are evident, though subtle, in the results of the two IT majors.

Though Q2 results of Infosys and TCS can be described as a case of contrasts with the former outperforming the latter, slowdown in consumer facing sectors such as BFSI and retail has rattled the IT bellwethers, say experts.

India's largest IT services firm TCS missed Street estimates after reporting double digit growth in the previous four quarters. This was in part due to slowdown in BFSI, its largest vertical and retail, which the company expected to pick up, and did not in Q2.

For Infosys, while the financial services fared well due to the Stater acquisition in the first quarter, its retail growth declined.

Sanchit Vir Gogia, founder, Greyhound Research, a technology advisory firm, said: ""This situation is not great. There is a sense of scare.""

Gogia pointed out that while the IT sector might do well due to festive season till December end, the fourth quarter will especially be challenging.

“The real challenge will start in 2020, when we will see how much investments goes where especially in consumer facing industries like BFSI and retail,” he added.

BFSI has been a cause for concern for the IT majors as large banks in Europe are cautious about investing. There has been softness in the US capital markets as well. Retail as both IT majors pointed, has not picked up and there is not enough visibility yet.

“But it is all dependent on the US economy at a very large level. We will have to wait for the next six months for more clarity to set in,” Gogia added.

The US is the largest revenue generator for IT firms and any macro-economic volatility in the continent will affect the business. There are uncertainties due to Brexit in the Europe, which is also effecting the business prospects for the firms.

Another cause for concern is the possible decline in digital revenues. Pareekh Jain, founder, Pareekh Consulting, said, “For IT firms, growth now depends on digital as legacy business is going down.”

Though digital revenues have been growing steadily at 35-40 percent year-on-year, the pace has declined this year. For instance, TCS’s digital revenue grew only 28 percent in Q2, from over 35 percent in Q1.

Infosys' digital revenue grew 38 percent in Q2, compared to 41 percent in Q1.

Digital revenues are important given that digital is becoming an engine for growth. For instance, Infosys’ core business growth declined 1.8 percent year-on-year to $1,980 million for the quarter ended September 2019 whereas digital grew 36 percent to $1,230 million.

The second quarter already saw some deal deferrals.

Underlining that the business environment is not as seasonal as it used to be, a top official of Tata Consulting Services reiterated that the country’s top IT company would continue to focus on posting a double digit growth in the financial year despite a muted first half.

“We were confident when we started the year,” Chief Financial Officer V Ramakrishnan told Moneycontrol about the company’s outlook for a double digit growth in FY20. “It is a challenge now…(but) we continue to be focused on that goal. It is not that we have given up,” said Ramakrishnan.

The reiteration is significant as market pundits raised doubts about TCS meeting its growth target after missing estimates in the second quarter.

The company reported 1 percent sequential decline in the September quarter profit at Rs 8,042 crore, missing expectations. The major concern was a slow down in constant currency revenue growth at 8.4 percent (YoY) in Q2FY20, after reporting double digit growth in previous four quarters.

This means that TCS would now have to have a better second half to get into a double-digit growth track. Traditionally, the third and fourth quarters have been “seasonally” slower.

But, that may not be the case anymore.

“We have been observing in the last five to six quarters, that seasonality is going off. There is no seasonally good quarter,” said Ramakrishnan and added that the trends were more broad based, across markets and across sectors.

At the same time, he added that some sectors, such as retail, may do well in December

“But seasonality by and large is a little different from a few years ago, when it was more pronounced,” added the senior executive.

Adding credence to the rational is the strong showing of the company in the third quarter of the last financial year, when it had managed a double-digit growth in revenues.

Retail push

One of the sectors that was expected to push TCS' growth in the second quarter was retail, especially to balance out the sluggishness in the BFSI segment, the company’s largest.

But, that did not happen.

The BFSI segment registered a 8 percent growth (YoY) in constant currency against 9.2 percent in previous quarter (but higher against 6.1 percent in Q2FY19) while the retail & CPG sector growth was 4.8 percent against 8.4 percent QoQ and 15.6 percent in Q2FY19.

“Retail is a surprise for us. We did expect retail to start picking up,” accepted Ramakrishnan. “But, some of the deals that were expected were pushed a little. There are retail businesses that are deeply challenged and some are going out of business,” he added.

That is why the upcoming holiday season is critical for the retail sector, with focus on more transactions, processing, pricing and customer promotion. “Last year, the brick and mortar companies did as much business as the online companies during the holiday season,” said the CFO, hoping that there will be a repeat this year too.

North America market

A 35-year veteran in the field, Ramakrishnan also headed TCS North America’s finance function for over seven years. The market is the largest pie for the company.

Despite the slowdown impacting the market, the company continues to be relevant, added the CFO.

“We have a deep relationship with our clients in the market. Some of them go back 35 years. Whatever the macroeconomic environment, the key is to stay relevant to the customers and understand what their requirement is and see where technology can make a difference in this business environment,” he said.

While agreeing that the last two years have been “soft,” Ramakrishnan said that, even as the bigger banks had curtailed investments, the smaller ones increased theirs. TCS is actively participating in the segment, he said.

Hiring and margins

TCS added a net of 14,097 employees in the second quarter, the highest ever number of employees to be on-boarded in the three-month period.

Much of the hiring was done anticipating the business growth, which though was muted. At the same time, the company is building capability with a major push in campus hiring, and then training them according to the skill requirement.

This may play a critical role, given the order book which was the highest in six quarters. As the orders come online, the hiring will begin to play a significant role.

In the second quarter though, it may have squeezed the margins. Its margin contracted 250bps YoY to 24 percent, missing analyst estimates of 25 percent.

But, with hiring not required in the same pace in the coming quarters, the margins may get a much required breather in the second half of the year.

Also giving out hope is the deal pipeline. “The deal pipeline is strong and demand environment is there,” said Ramakrishnan.",801,-0.1443761501993452

But Infosys is better placed than TCS to win large deals which will provide better growth visibility ahead, Paras Bothra, President of Equity Research, Ashika Group of Companies, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Q) Indian market rose marginally in the week gone by but do you think that we are out of the woods. What should be the trading strategy of investors for the rest of the October series and important levels to track?

A) A host of negative news has been haunting the market in the past couple of weeks thus restraining the market momentum. Globally, uncertainties like Brexit and delay in resolution of the US-China trade war are major overhangs for the market going ahead.

Back home, a new set of corporate defaults and the PMC crisis spooked the investors’ confidence. In addition to the above factors, global rating agencies fear that the present slowdown could be related to long-lasting factors.

Despite corporate tax rate cut by the government, the market failed to hold on to substantial gains registered earlier, partly in anticipation of subdued Q2 corporate earnings growth and partly because of sour sentiment in the financial sector.

Due to exceptional volatility (which is almost double than the normal), Nifty is expected to trade in a broader range between 10,778-11,720 till October 31.

Q) Do you think any adverse decision on the trade war front over the weekend could put bulls on the back foot? We have seen plenty of volatility in the week gone by already due to trade war rhetoric?

A) The fear of trade war has been affecting the sentiment of Indian markets in the last one and a half year, and the negotiations between US and China have gone into 13 rounds without any major conclusions.

This made the market volatile and created uncertainty among the investors' community over a considerable period. The resolution of the trade war will hold the key for an upgrade of global economic growth as well as positive momentum in global equities markets.

Q) Plenty of stocks have slipped from their 52-week highs in the S&P BSE 500 index since September 20 (breakout). What should be the selection criteria of investors in picking stocks?

A) Most of the stocks in BSE 500 index have wiped off the gains since September 20 on the backdrop of renewed fear of corporate defaults, PMC crisis and expectation of subdued Q2 earnings growth for corporate India.

Thus, it is better to stick to quality companies with a strong balance sheet, efficient management pedigree, good business moat, and substantial tax gains post the recent cut in the corporate tax rate.

Q) What are your views in Infosys and TCS -- which one is a better bet or investors should move funds to midcap IT?

A) Slowing global economic growth has been hurting Indian IT companies’ earnings. Factors like Brexit, trade war and stringent visa norms have resulted in local hiring in the US and have been impacting IT companies' growth and margins.

Q2FY20 has been disappointing for TCS as the IT major missed the estimates on revenue, profit and margin front. Thus, achieving double-digit growth in FY20 is unlikely to happen for TCS due to headwinds from the Europe BFSI segment.

In contrast, Infosys is better placed to win large deals which will provide better growth visibility ahead.

The concept of rising digitalisation has completely changed the dynamics of the IT industry thus, those companies with a large share of the revenue from the digital business are going to benefit most in the coming days. Thus, odds are in favour of large IT companies having a higher share from digital revenue.

Q) Banking stocks have again back in bear grip due to the news flow and asset quality woes. What are your view and how should investors approach this sector now?

A) Although, minor asset quality hiccups have surfaced recently for listed banking space. However, these incremental issues would not be large and probably could be taken care of through adequate provisioning by banks.

Large ticket size NPAs have all been majorly recognized in the last two years which are going through resolution in IBC/NCLT.

Large private banks are going to benefit at the cost of weaker banks with a lot of NPA issues and capital constraints.

Hence, large banks with efficient management and controlled NPAs are going to be key beneficiaries of this financial crisis witnessed in the last couple of years.

Since the earnings season has begun, volatility will remain high across the board, traders should focus more on risk management aspect and avoid naked leveraged trades, Ajit Mishra Vice President, Research, Religare Broking, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.



Q) Indian market rose marginally in the week gone by, but do you think that we are out of the woods? What should be the trading strategy of investors for the rest of the October series and the important levels to track?

A) The Nifty50 traded lackluster last week and somehow managed to end in the green. However, the price action suggests that there could be further consolidation. Thus traders should continue with the stock-specific trading approach.

Since the earnings season has begun, volatility will remain high across the board. Traders should focus more on risk management and avoid naked leveraged trades. We expect the Nifty50 to hover within the 11,000-11,500 band next week.

Q) Do you think any adverse decision on the trade war front over the weekend could put bulls on the back foot? We have seen plenty of volatility in the week gone by already due to trade war rhetoric?

A) The trade war tensions between two of the largest economies, the US and China, have been one of the most crucial events which have kept global markets on the edge.

We believe that any adverse decision on the trade war front would negatively impact the sentiment. However, we believe that the impact on Indian indices would be less severe as compared to US and China markets.

Q) Plenty of stocks have slipped from their 52-week highs on the S&P BSE 500 index since September 20 (breakout). What should be the selection criteria of investors in picking stocks?

A) The correction in several stocks is a result of profit booking, as well as concern over muted demand and expensive valuation as the recent government measures, could take time to yield results.

We believe that in a volatile market, the focus should be on stocks with strong corporate governance, a healthy balance sheet, comfortable valuations and good growth prospects.

Some of the good companies are available at an attractive valuation, thus providing a margin of safety. On the other hand, one should exit/book losses in stocks with deteriorating fundamentals, high debt, and corporate governance concerns.

Q) What are your views in Infosys and TCS – which one is a better bet or investors should move funds to midcap IT?

A) We are positive on Infosys and TCS both from a long term perspective and recommend to buy on the stock on dips.

Infosys: We believe that the business growth could witness some pressure in the near term but we remain constructive on long term growth prospects of the company due to its increased focus on digital business, a rising share of high margin business and strong management.

TCS: The company is India’s largest IT company and offers its services to a wide range of industries such as BFSI, manufacturing, Telecom, retail, transportation, and insurance.

It has over 4,20,000 consultants present in over 50 countries. In terms of revenue, 51 percent of its business comes from North America. We believe that the company is well placed to benefit from the increasing demand for offshore IT services seen over the last decade.

Further, the company’s wide experience and strong clientele would enable it to maintain its strong position in the IT space. In Q2FY20 the company delivered a subdued set of numbers.

Nonetheless, we expect revenue growth to remain healthy in the medium to long term led by strong traction in the digital revenue and strong momentum in deal wins.

Q) Banking stocks have again back in the bears' grip due to the news flow and asset quality woes. What are your view and how should investors approach this sector now?

A) The negative news flow regarding exposure of banks to troubled housing finance companies as well as fresh asset quality concerns post-PMC bank debacle has led to pessimism in the banking space.

Despite the RBI’s 25bps rate cut in this bi-monthly policy and cumulative rate cut of 135 bps so far this year, banking stocks continued to decline from the highs made post corporate tax cut announcement.

Going forward, banks and NBFCs are likely to be key beneficiaries of a corporate tax rate cut and this may start reflecting in their Q2FY20 earnings. Further, the impact of lower interest rates on the loan book/credit growth should also be visible in the coming months.

Moreover, liquidity infusion through RBI’s surplus transfer, recapitalization of public sector undertaking (PSU) banks and mega amalgamation of these banks are the other key factors that should spur banking sector growth.

We also expect asset quality to improve as weak assets are recognised and provided for and banks adopt stringent norms for loan disbursements.

Currently, many banks are trading below their historical P/BV average. Hence any correction in banks with high asset quality and strong corporate governance should be viewed as a buying opportunity.

The largest software exporter TCS on Thursday reported a tepid growth in net income for the September quarter at Rs 8,042 crore, and guided towards more challenges putting a big question mark over its ability to deliver the double-digit growth trajectory.

The gap between operating profit margins achieved and the aspirational number in the region of 28 percent widened, with the quarterly number printing in at a low 24 percent.

In what can be seen as an effort to calm the investors, the Tata Group company declared a second interim dividend of Rs 5 along with a special dividend of Rs 40.

TCS was the first large firm to open the second quarter earnings season and it would be interesting to see what others report in the coming days, especially its immediate rival Infosys on Friday.

Significantly, hours ahead of the TCS numbers, domestic ratings agency Crisil said it expects India Inc's revenue growth to fall to a 14-quarter low during this earning season.

It can be noted that citing rising uncertainties in the business environment, the software industry lobby Nasscom had in February stopped giving its yearly revenue growth estimates for the sector.

The Tata Group cash-cow delivered a tepid 5.8 percent spike in revenue growth at Rs 38,977 crore for the quarter, blaming the sluggishness in its mainstay of banking and also the retail sector for its woes.

""It is definitely lower than what we had thought at the start of the year,"" managing director and chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan told reporters departing from the company's typically cautious stance on commentary.

""We expected it to be a defining quarter, but it has come in wherever it is and we would require H2 to be better than H1 to get into double-digits. But we will have to wait and see how it unfolds,"" he said.

As a silver-lining, he said, he isn't worried much about the demand environment as a whole as the deal pipeline is still strong, and hinted at ""right-sizing"" the cost base to improve on the margins.

However, Gopinathan sounded circumspect about achieving the double-digit revenue growth mark for FY20.

""Seasonally H2 is weaker. If you have to get to double-digits, we will have to deliver a H2 which is better than H1 and as of now it looks challenging, but we are focused on making sure that we participate in all the opportunities that are there and put our best foot forward,"" he said.

Revenue growth from the mainstay of the BFSI sector continued to slow down to 8 percent as large banks and the storied names from Wall Street showed weariness in spends, he said, adding, however, the smaller banks are doing well.

Gopinathan singled out the retail sector, where revenue grew by only a tepid 4 percent, as an area which dented the performance the most.

""Incrementally, weakness in revenue is primarily coming from retail. We were expecting much better numbers from retail from the US and England,"" he said.

He said TCS signed deals worth over USD 6.4 billion in revenue potential during the quarter and is also participating in many negotiations. However, he rued that not many of the deals are fructifying.

""There is an increase in deal size and deal duration which is good from the structural side. But it will take time for the order book to convert. I won't expect any acceleration in Q3 and Q4,"" he said, conceding that it had expected Q2 to be a ""defining"" quarter.

Geographically, Europe and England delivered handsome revenue growth but same was not the case with US, he said, adding there was weakness in other geographies like India, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific as well.

Share of new age digital revenues grew to 33.2 percent of the revenue base on the back of a 28 percent growth.

From a margin perspective, the operating margin printed in at a nine-quarter low of 24 percent, much below the aspirational target of 26-28 percent.

When asked about target band, chief financial officer V Ramakrishnan chose not to directly answer the aspirational band saying there is scope for more improvement on this front as there are no structural headwinds.

It got impacted the most both because of lower revenue flows and also higher amount of overheads like higher wage outflows due to hiring of 14,000 during the quarter, he said, adding in the future talent investment will only be on a project-specific basis and not proactive.

Ramakrishnan also said the company will not benefit from the corporate tax cut as it already enjoys a slew tax incentives by the sheer nature of its business.

Currency also played a truant, he said, adding the perception of help coming in because of the rupee depreciation is also a misnomer as the domestic currency has lost ground only against the dollar, while it has appreciated or stayed stable in case of others like the British pound and the euro during the quarter.

Its overall employee base stands at over 4.50 lakh and the head of human resources Milind Lakkad said it will hire 30,000 from campuses in the next fiscal as well.

Gopinathan said after many quarters, the company was able to ensure that the sub-contracting costs are stable.

The results ""confirm the risks to TCS' earlier outlook of double-digits growth and we would reckon that the street will align FY20 revenue growth to under 9 percent on constant currency basis,"" analysts at the city-based brokerage Emkay Global said.

Ahead of the earnings announcement in the evening, the TCS counter shed 0.80 percent at Rs 2,004.40 on the BSE, as against a 0.78 percent correction on the benchmark.",951,-0.2657981107109471

Anticipating high growth, TCS on-boarded the highest number of employees in a quarter for the three months that ended on September 30.

In a statement, the company said that net addition of employees for the second quarter was about 14,097, its highest ever in a quarter.

During Q1, the company had announced that it gave offer letters to 30,000 freshers. It on-boarded 12,000 employees in the quarter that ended on June 2019, and absorbed the rest in the previous quarter.

Speaking to media persons, Milind Lakkad, Global Head, Human Resources, that the company increasing its overall capacity as it gears up for high growth.

This comes despite the moderate performance of the company in the light of macro-economic volatility and softness in banking, its largest vertical. The IT major’s results were below market expectations in terms of margins, revenue growth, BFSI and retail and digital.

The company’s digital revenues grew 28 percent year-on-year for the second quarter and it accounts for about 33 percent of overall revenue. However the growth is much less compared to the 30-40 percent growth range the company witnessed in the last few quarters.

Lakkad pointed out that despite uncertainties, the company sees no slowdown when it comes to digital. “Technology is fast evolving and changing. There is demand. We are constrained by talent,” he added.

According to TCS, of the $6.4 billion order book, most of them are digital including migration to cloud, blockchain and digital transformation. There is a huge demand for data and analytics, cloud and automation.

However resources that can cater to these demands are not enough.

That is why the company is investing in training its employees. In a statement, the company said that it continues to invest in organic talent development in emerging technologies. “At the end of Q2, over 322,000 employees had been trained on multiple new technologies, and over 391,000 had been trained on Agile methods,” the company said in a statement.",338,0.4327681575502668

The Nifty Services Sector index has formed a head & shoulders pattern at the top of the rally, but it is still 5 percent away from the neckline support.

It looks like the stock is experiencing a distribution formation and once it breaks the neckline support, which is a crucial support line, then the real decline starts.

In case the Nifty services index falls and breaks below the support of the neckline, then it would retest lower levels of October 2018, which is 13 percent down from the neckline support.

It is trading at 15,700 and the neckline support is placed at 15,000. The reason behind covering the Nifty Services index is mainly due to two major observations.

First, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut the GDP estimate from 6.9 percent to 6.1 percent, and second, the index is of the services sector which is a part of the GDP.

The index is designed to reflect the behaviour and performance of services sector companies, which include computers software and IT Education that have a weightage of 22.43 percent, financial services have a weightage of 68.05 percent.

These two sectors together account for 90.48 percent, the remaining contribution comes from four others sectors -- energy, telecom, services, and media.

The services index has offered significant returns to investors as it includes major stocks such as HDFC Ltd, HDFC Bank, Infosys and TCS. In the financial space, stocks include Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI and Bajaj Finance.

We covered HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and SBI in our previous updates and for the current week, we are covering HDFC Ltd, Infosys, and Bajaj Finance.

Technically, HDFC Ltd is failing to sustain above the level of Rs 2,000, which is negative and may decline to the next support that is placed around Rs 1,900-1,880 levels.

It is forming lower lows on the daily charts, but the fall is gradual and is trading in a wide range. If HDFC Ltd corrects towards Rs 1,900, investors can go long, with a final stop loss placed at Rs 1,800.

Infosys Ltd is indicating that it would remain range-bound between Rs 835 and Rs 765. Take profit on trading positions only if it bounces towards Rs 830-835.

Bajaj Financ is the most outperforming stock in the basket in the last two months. It was trading around Rs 2,900 levels, and from there it went towards Rs 4,100 levels. Price formation suggests that the strategy should be to buy on dips at major supports like Rs 3,700 and Rs 3,500.

Nifty technical outlook

There is a strong support for the Nifty at 11,140. But, if it breaks 11,140 then it would open the possibilities of hitting either 11,050 or 10,850 levels.

In case the Nifty refuses to fall below the same, then it will have major bullish implications. It seems unlikely, as domestic and global news flows are negative and could increase the selling pressure if indices break crucial supports.

On the higher side, the Nifty will face hurdles at 11,300 and 11,400. The broader formation is indicating that the Nifty is likely to form a higher bottom either at 11,050 or around 10,850, till there is no reversal formation, we should avoid any short-term trading call.

The market snapped from its three-week rally as the bulls were completely trapped throughout week that ended on October 4.

Rising concerns over banks' exposure to NBFCs and real estate after PMC Bank-HDIL fraud and Lakshmi Vilas Bank placed under Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s prompt corrective action hit market sentiment.

The fall in Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections to a 19-month low, weak September auto sales YoY (though improved MoM), a lower-than-expected repo rate cut and the reduction in full year GDP growth forecast by RBI along with global economic slowdown fears also dampened the mood on the street.

The BSE Sensex and Nifty50 fell 3 percent each during the truncated week after rising 5 percent each in their previous three consecutive weeks, which indicated that the corporate tax rate cut's momentum is waning.

Experts feel that as the market entered into an oversold zone, it is expected to see some bounce back initially in the coming truncated week, partly backed by the US jobs report that lifted Wall Street.

But overall, it may remain volatile ahead of the September quarter earnings season and till the results of recent government measures along with transmission of rate cuts.

""Since we are heading towards the earnings season, a lot of cues will now be taken from important results of TCS, Wipro, and Infosys. Volatility may be inching up in specific sectors and some rotation may be seen. With that, we will also see global developments taking the lead and influence since everyone has their eyes on the US-China trade war,"" Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research told Moneycontrol.

Vinod Nair Head of Research: Geojit Financial Services said, ""Despite cut in taxes and government stimulus, the broad economy will take more time to gain and invest in new projects. Having said that the worst for domestic economy may be over by Q2–Q3 FY20.

""We can expect a faster recovery in consumption led by the stability in the job market, festive seasons and a reduction in interest costs. This quick benefit cannot be replicated in non-consumer segment as financial sector and new investments have a lag-effect,"" he added.

The broader markets fell more than frontliners with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices losing nearly 4 percent each while all sectoral indices, barring IT and Energy, closed in the red.

The market will remain shut on October 8 for Dussehra.

Here are 10 key things that will keep traders busy this week:

Earnings

The July-September quarter earnings season will begin later in the coming week. Among laregcaps, Infosys, TCS and IndusInd Bank numbers will be key to watch out for.

Goa Carbon, GM Breweries, Bajaj Consumer Care, Hathway Bhawani Cabletel, Den Networks, Avenue Supermarts, ITI, California Software Company etc will also announce their results during the week.

""The earning season for Q2FY20 is unlikely to throw any surprises. RBI’s downward revision of GDP growth to 5.3 percent for Q2FY20 (in the backdrop of 5 percent growth in Q1FY20) from earlier 5.8-6.6 percent in H1FY20 says it all,"" Pankaj Bobade, Head of Fundamental Research, Axis Securities told Moneycontrol. All eyes would now be on the management commentary to understand how they see the performance for the rest of the year, he said.

TCS

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), country's second largest company by market cap, will announce its quarterly earnings on October 10. Brokerages feel overall numbers are expected to be steady during the quarter with constant currency revenue growth at around 3 percent.

Edelweiss expects TCS to deliver 3.5 percent constant currency revenue growth QoQ (2.9 percent in USD owing to cross-currency headwinds) as softness in European BFSI space to be offset by

strong growth metrics in North America.

The margin growth could be around 90-100bps QoQ and is expected to be supported by rupee depreciation in the absence of wage hikes while the profit may be flat to marginally positive on a sequential basis.

""We expect EBIT margins to improve by 90bps sequentially to 25.1 percent, aided by growth leverage, absence of wage increments, visa expenses and a slight INR depreciation.

Key issues to watch for would be the outlook and visibility for double-digit growth in FY20, the rajectory of margins amid rising sub-contractor expenses, its growth in the retail vertical, the commentary on the macro environment spends by retail clients, its growth in digital and BFSI, and manufacturing demand in North America and Europe.

Infosys

Infosys, the country's second largest IT company, is also expected to deliver steady growth in Q2FY20 with constant currency revenue growth of more than 3 percent QoQ supported by Starter NV deal and the likely upward revision in full year revenue guidance. The company will announce its numbers on October 11.

""We expect constant currency revenue growth of 3.6 percent and cross currency headwind of 58 bps; revenue growth will also be aided by Starter N.V deal (50bps),"" Prabhudas Lilladher said.

Brokerages feel the EBIT margin is likely to improve by 90-100bps sequentially owing to a weak rupee and operational efficiencies, and the absence of wage hikes while full year constant currency revenue growth could be revised to 9-11 percent from 8.5-10 percent currently.

Hence apart from the full year revenue growth guidance, the total contract value of large deal acquisitions, the commentary of US & European BFSI verticals, revenue conversion of past deals, outlook on margins for FY20 and attrition rate would also be closely watched.

US-China Trade Talks

Chinese and US officials will be meeting later this week to strike a trade deal, which will key to watch out for globally as the trade war continues to impact global growth after both countries started putting tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods on each other.

A high-level Chinese delegation is coming to the US for two-day meeting (October 10-11) for talks with officials from Trump's administration, including US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

US President Donald Trump on October 4 said that he would like to have a trade deal with China only if it is a great one for his country. He further said he has a very good chance of making a deal with China.

""Right now, we are in a very important stage in terms of possibly making a deal. If we make it, it will be the biggest trade deal ever made,"" the president said.

FII Outflow

The consistent outflow of foreign money is one of reasons for correction and weak sentiment in the market, which suggests that they continued to be on risk-off mode on account of global slowdown and trade issues.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net sellers to the tune of more than Rs 3,200 crore in week gone by, taking total outflow to nearly Rs 44,000 crore since May this year.

On the contrary, domestic institutional investors remained strong supporters to the market as they bought nearly Rs 3,500 crore worth of shares during the week. In fact their buying since May in total (Rs 65,750 crore) was much higher than FIIs outflow.

Experts feel FIIs money may return to India once the growth starts getting back on track.

Macro Data

Industrial production data for the month of August 2019 will be closely watched by the street as it is going to release on October 11.

Industrial output grew 4.3 percent month-on-month (MoM) in July against 1.2 percent growth in June that was revised downwards from 2 percent.

Foreign exchange reserves data for week that ended on October 4, and deposit and bank loan growth for the fortnight that ended on September 27 will be announced on the same day.

Technical View

The Nifty50 fell sharply on October 4 as well as for the week, forming a large bearish candle on the daily and weekly charts which indicated the bears have an upperhand on Dalal Street.

The index has also broken its 200 DEMA to close below the 11,200 level at 11,174.75 and resistance is also gradually shifting lower. Experts feel the index has strong support around 11,000-11,100 levels and if it breaks the same then there could be steep fall in market while if it gets back above 11,200 then there could be short covering.

""Markets have erased almost 3 percent of its gains last week and it is now very important for the market to hold the 11,100-11,150 levels. If those are taken out on a closing basis we may be going back in the range of 11,000-10,800. That is very bearish given the buying that was seen. But we believe this bearishness should be till 11,100 levels. That is an important point, and, since the undertone is bullish we may see some buying coming in,"" Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research said.

F&O Cues

Option data suggests a shift in the lower trading range for the Nifty to around 11,000 to 11,600 levels.

Maximum Put open interest is at 11,000 followed by 11,200 strike while maximum Call open interest is at 11,500 followed by 12,000 strike. Call writing was seen at 11,300, followed by 11,500 and 11,800 strikes whereas marginal Put writing was seen at 11,200 then 11,000 and 10,500 strikes.

""The noticeable Put base is placed at 11,000 Put strike. However, some positions at this strike have shifted from higher Put strikes. The noticeable Call base is placed at 11,500, which means the Nifty may enter into short-term consolidation with immediate support at 11,000,"" Amit Gupta of ICICIdirect said.

India VIX moved up by 9.12 percent from 16.11 to 17.58 levels during the week.

People are being laid off and factories are being shut down as demand for products and services reduce across sectors such as automobiles and FMCG. But not the IT sector.

In fact, IT is one of the few sectors that is bucking the trend even as uncertainty looms when it comes to client spending globally. The experience of having weathered multiple slowdowns in its journey and strong financials will keep the sector afloat, say experts.

In a recent interaction with Moneycontrol, Kris Gopalakrishnan, co-founder, Infosys, said, “IT sector is an exception and doing extremely well.”

The statement is not without any basis. Case in point are the robust deal bookings the IT majors witnessed.

Robust pipeline

In March 2019, HCL Tech renewed its deal with Xerox for $1.3 billion for a seven year period. It also bagged 12 large deals for the quarter that ended on June 2019. HCL Tech had given revenue guidance of 14-16 percent in constant currency terms.

TCS’ reported $5.7 billion deal win in the first quarter of FY20 compared to $4.9 billion in FY19 for the same period. The company is confident of achieving its margin guidance of 26-28 percent.

Infosys reported its biggest deal wins of $2.7 billion for Q1 and even raised its revenue guidance to 8.5-10 percent, up from 7.5-9.5 percent it gave in Q4 FY19 in the light of strong deal momentum.

In addition, the second quarter saw large scale deal wins for IT majors. For instance, Wipro won $300 million digital transformation deal from ICICI bank. TCS and General Motors had also inked a deal to work on future mobility. According to reports, the deal is worth $600 million.

The IT majors during their first quarter results announcement said that they are confident of meeting their guidance despite uncertainties.

Looming uncertainties

Globally there are uncertainties with regards to client spending, especially in the banking and financial verticals, one of the biggest verticals for major IT firms. However it is neither new nor big enough for the IT majors to worry about.

The sector has seen multiple slowdowns since the 1990s and in the first decade of the century and it was able to weather them well with the right leaderships decisions.

Also, the Indian IT firms are highly profitable. Most of them have zero debt and lot of cash on their balance sheet.

In addition, the digital transformation of IT firms is also a driving factor that will keep them insulated from slowdown pangs.

Nitin Rakesh, CEO, Mphasis, an IT service firm, pointed out that despite the slowdown or because of the slowdown, firms are more than willing to invest in IT to improve efficiency and cut down costs.

“Because that’s (technology adoption) an irreversible phenomenon. If anything they (clients) will say, let's squeeze my core business because I don’t want to spend any money there. So that gives me an opportunity to accelerate my digital spend,” he added.

Also in terms of domestic market, the slowdown is unlikely to impact the IT sector since business from Indian market is not very significant. For most IT services firms in India, revenue from India operations account for about less than 10 percent of the overall revenue.

“So I’m very optimistic about the IT industry, which is still a growing industry according to NASSCOM data,” Gopalakrishnan added.

Employment generation

The growth of IT is critical as it is the second largest employment generator in India. According to a recent employment report by CARE ratings, the sector will employ close to 12.30 lakh people in 2019, up 8 percent from 2018. This number in only next to the banking sector that employs 12.60 lakh people.

This reflected in the hiring growth in the major IT firms as well. FY19 saw positive sentiment return as IT majors went on a hiring spree after a lull in the last couple of years.

TCS saw the highest ever recruitment in the last five years for its first quarter ended June 2019. It gave offer letter to close to 30,000 freshers in the first quarter.

Some challenges

However there is word of caution. As positive the IT firms are, the major challenge is employee skilling, said Supaul Chanda, Business Head, Teamlease Digital, an IT staffing firm. Employees who are unable to upskill are being let off and those with new age skills are hard to find.

In a way what the IT sector is facing is not the recession in terms of business but of skills, he added.",763,0.43608385053547943

It is targeted at custodians, broker dealers, asset managers and investment and private banks, TCS said in a statement.

Stricter H-1B Visa approval requirements could be linked to the increased attrition rate of Indian Information Technology (IT) companies after 2017, as per industry experts. IT firms in India were known to claim the highest H-1B visas in the cap that stands at 65,000 by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. Due to increased rate rejection of these visas after President Donald Trump’s ""Buy American, Hire American"" executive order in 2017, IT firms have felt the brunt of this order.

IT service sector is known to be very competitive in general. Known for its large campus intakes, majority of employees in this sector hold bachelor's degrees. Multnational Corporations become attractive to junior employees if they see a possibility of small hikes and an opportunity to work overseas. But a number of these rejections come from the inability of the employer to prove that the job is a specialty occupation, which compels them to hire locally in America and increases costs for the company.

Denial Rate of Continuing H-1B Petition (Data via USCIS H-1B Employer Data Hub, National Foundation for American Policy) Fiscal Year Denial Rate FY19 (Q1) 18% FY18 12% FY17 5% FY16 4% FY15 3% FY14 3% FY12 3% FY10 5% FY09 6%

If we see the trend of H1-B applications after the tightened regime, there was a 6 percent rejection in FY 2015 which increased to 32 percent in the first quarter of FY 2019 as per Forbes . And since IT firms were the highest claimant in the past, they are heavily impacted. Cognizant recorded 4,338 denials between 2017 and 2018, which accounted for 32 percent of the applications .

This scrutiny is seen in both first-time applications and applications by continuing employees that look to renew their visas.

Another hurdle for the companies is issuance of requirement for evidence or RFE. Since the visa is only for skilled professionals for a tenure of three to six years, employing companies have to furnish proofs. It includes employer-employee relationship, duration with nature of work and employee’ qualification. Data for the first quarter of US fiscal 2019 shows that 60 percent of all completed H-1B cases had been issued RFEs. Of these cases, 39 percent were rejected. It is a significant increase from 38 percent RFEs during FY 2018 as per a report by Economic Times. Out of the top-30 IT companies, Cognizant, Tata, and Infosys are among the biggest. These companies teamed up small salary hikes with opportunity to work overseas as employee retention methods. More than salary requirements, studies show that Indians aspire to move abroad. India has the highest Mobility Index with 17 million Indians living abroad in 2017. This made India the largest source country seeing 143 percent in mobility from 1990. Infosys COO UB Pravin Rao was recently quoted in ToI report saying, ""We can arrest attrition from expense management but to a large extent, we believe it's more about giving them opportunities, more about a new narrative around some of these initiatives that we are doing, enabling them on their career progression and so on."" He further went on to say that this matter will not be solved by just giving raises or increments.

Indian IT firms have moved from Indian employees to local American employees wherever possible. They might have also planned to offshore most of their activities to India to reduce costs.",571,-0.3269456426302592

Tata Consultancy Services will acquire certain assets of General Motors' (GM) technical centre (GMTC-1) in Bengaluru and has also signed a five-year strategic agreement to support GM's global vehicle programme.

The programme will look at the future of mobility including how to make vehicles with zero emissions and crashes.

In a statement, the IT major said over 1,300 employees from GMTC-1 will be transferred to TCS including teams focused on propulsion systems, vehicle engineering, controls development, testing, creative design and special projects.

The transaction and handover are expected to be completed by the end of September, according to a press statement.

""TCS has been an outstanding partner for 16 years. We are pleased to evolve our partnership even further, as we work to deliver on our commitment to create a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion,"" Dan Nicholson, Vice President, electrification, controls, software & electronics, GM, said in a statement.

TCS in partnership with GM will help the latter design and engineer vehicles that set benchmarks in driving experience, safety and emissions.

Brian McMurray, GMTC-I Vice-President engineering and operations, said that the design and engineering center in Bengaluru had contributed to a number of innovations in GM’s global vehicle portfolio over many years.

""As a result of our new partnership, the design and engineering teams in Bengaluru will continue to play an important role in GM’s core business.

A US court has denied request for a fresh trial against Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) brought on by its former employees.

Moneycontrol has viewed a copy of the order.

The case was initially filed by three former employees after they were fired by TCS. In their lawsuit, they alleged they were fired as they were not of south Asian or Indian origin.

However, the nine-member California jury unanimously ruled in favour of the IT major in November last year. Following the ruling, employees filed a motion to review the case at the Northern District of California district court.

In its August 20 order, the jury had rejected the claims of the three employees based on evidence presented in court by TCS.

The company presented evidence that pointed to reasons which resulted in their firing. This includes their unwillingness to relocate. The order states that in its defence, TCS has highlighted two non-discriminatory factors contributing to majority of Indian and South Asian nationals in its workforce.

One, the US education system provides less than half the computer science graduates for entry-level jobs. Also, locals display resistance to TCS' relocation requirement for IT consulting. According to TCS, this is one of the largest challenges in hiring locally and also why unallocated employees were terminated.

The order also looks into Ashok Seetharaman, TCS' Deputy Head of Human Resources, testimony that close to 845 of its employees were unallocated (bench) due to various reasons such as performance-related issues, customer escalations or violation of TCS' policies.

Given the evidence, the Court in its order said, ""The Court is unpersuaded that it has erred in either of the evidentiary rulings raised by the motion. For the foregoing reasons, the court denies the plaintiffs motion for a new trial,"" the order concluded.

Though the company is yet to comment on the new development, after the verdict in November 2018, it said, ""We have always maintained, the claims made in this case were baseless and are gratified that the jury agreed. The success of TCS rests on the talents, expertise and deep industry knowledge of our employees, who help our customers in their growth and transformation journeys. The decisions we make about the hiring and retention of employees are based purely on their capabilities and fit in serving our customers' business needs.""",394,-0.49949260950088503

IT companies are increasing their efforts to prevent young skilled employees from quitting, according to a report in The Economic Times.

They are trying to stem the problem with better salary hikes and promotions along with overall employee value proposition.

Companies have even given retention bonuses of Rs 1 lakh to junior employees. A spokesperson of Wipro said that employees are given managerial positions and client-facing roles if they seek better roles and leadership opportunities to advance their career path.

Employees with at least 3 years of work experience along with mid-senior level employees tend to leave due to the skillsets that they have acquired while experienced senior employees are also at high risk of leaving, the average increase in attrition rate in the industry is around 1, according to Debasmita Das, principal – careers and hi-tech industry lead at Mercer.

Top IT firms like Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant and TCS have reported a higher attrition rate in Q2. Cognizant is at 23 percent attrition in Q2 which was at 19 percent in Q1. Infosys reported 23.4 percent attrition in Q2 jumping from 20.4 percent in Q1 while Wipro also saw a 1 percent increase as per the daily.

As the sector faces a regrettable attrition rate— when the replacement cost of experienced employees become high— Cognizant has established a Transformation Office to stem the problem.

Lakshminarayanan, 58, has been president and CEO of Tata Consultancy Services Japan, Ltd. since 2014.

""Tata Communications Limited has today selected Mr. Amur Swaminathan Lakshminarayanan to be appointed as the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD& CEO) of the Company subject to receipt of necessary regulatory approvals as may be required by the Company,"" the telecom company in a regulatory filing.

""He has experience with telecom and he has a track record of working well with the existing management and growing the business,"" a TCS executive told the daily.

The appointment is subject to regulatory approvals.

Lakshminarayanan joined TCS in 1983, and is believed to have been instrumental in developing various fronts of the company’s business.

With a presence in over 200 countries, Tata Communications along with TCS operates the largest wholly-owned subsea fibre network.

""I often tell my teams you have to play the cards you’re dealt… My philosophy has always been, make the best of what you have. Deal with what’s in front of you, not with ‘what ifs.’” Lakshminarayanan was quoted saying to Japan Times.

The top position at Tata Communications was previously held by Vinod Kumar, who resigned from the company on July 2 citing personal reasons. The resignation came after the company announced a loss of Rs 82.37 crore in the year ended March, the third year in the red, as per reports.

The board had accepted his decision to step down.

The report suggests that as a remedy to contain losses, Tata Sons might under the new leader combine some businesses of Tata Communication with TCS, and sell the rest. The backing of the Union government, which has a stake of around 26 per cent in Tata Communications, is crucial in this plan, the report says.

""Some similar services of Tata Communications may be merged with TCS and the rest of the business sold as separate business ventures. But it may not be an easy plan to execute, given the government shareholding in the company,"" said a source to the daily.

Meanwhile, Vinod Kumar, the former CEO, has joined Vodafone Group as CEO of Vodafone Business. Kumar’s appointment with the UK-based telecom giant will be effective from September 2, 2019 as per reports.",395,0.2521183689435323

Indian markets have remained resilient in 2019 despite bad news and even hit new record highs largely on the back of strong buying seen in some key heavyweights, describes as ‘HRITHIK’ stocks by market commentators .

HRITHIK is an acronym for the seven blue chips – HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Infosys, TCS, HDFC, ITC, and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Six of the seven stocks rose 8-20 percent compared to 4 percent rise seen in Nfity50 so far in 2019.

These seven account for more than 40 percent weight in the Nifty, and any substantial rise or fall in these stocks is likely to dictate the fate of the index.

The Nifty50, which hit a record high in June, went south and broke below crucial support levels on its way down. A close look at the HRITHIK stocks will help us understand this sudden U-turn .

Five—HDFC Bank, TCS, RIL, ITC, and HDFC Ltd —of the seven stocks have fallen 1-7 percent in July. Kotak Mahindra Bank rose 2 percent, and Infosys rallied more than 7 percent in the same period.

Most experts feel that investors are booking profits in the HRITHIK stocks, which were already trading at expensive valuations, and trend could well continue for some more time that would eventually cap the upside for the Nifty50 index as well.

“HRITHIK (HDFC, RIL, INFY, TCS, HUL, INDUS, KOTAK BANK) stocks can perform contrary to the broader market for quite a long time although these will also undergo correction due to relative valuation concerns or profit booking or reweighting of portfolios,” Deepak Jasani , Head, Retail Research at HDFC Securities, told Moneycontrol.

“The rally in these stocks enabled Nifty to break into new high in early June 2019. However, now it may be difficult for the Nifty to make another high till a wider section of the top 100-150 stock starts to perform; of course one would wish for even the small and midcap stocks to start performing,” he said.

Experts are of the opinion that at a time when the economy is showing signs of a slowdown, the HRITHIK stocks could underperform but will not fail or investors will not losses all their money. They could be called safe bets.

“As long as these companies deliver on performance, they will continue to move higher. Corrections will happen along the way. We disagree with the notion that these companies will fail but they could certainly disappoint on growth. Some of these stocks have stellar management and strong barriers to entry,” Sunil Sharma, Chief Investment Officer, Sanctum Wealth Management, told Moneycontrol.

“One or two of them may not succeed but if you look at Amazon, Apple in the US, they have worked for over 20 years, Coke for over 50 years, etc. Certainly along the way business models will change and it is the job of the investor to identify changing conditions,” he said.

The June quarter is likely to mimic the March quarter with financials leading the growth while consumer discretionary, consumer staples, Industrials, material, and real estate could well post declining trend sequentially in the top-line growth.

With a balance sheet size of Rs 36,282 crore as of June-end, DCB is a small-sized private bank. Hence, the bank must grow higher than the industry to remain relevant and gain scale.

The very question, how important is digital, could be considered archaic if the quarterly results of the top IT majors and their optimism in the digital space are taken as indicators.

The top IT firms have ramped up their hiring for the quarter, especially in new age technologies. These enterprises have also sharpened their focus on digital platforms, which is a key business strategy.

This is despite the softness in demand due to political uncertainty in Europe, especially in banking and financial services and insurance sectors (BFSI), healthcare and retail.

In fact it would not be too much of a stretch to say it is this very focus on digital platform and services that are helping these firms tide over the uncertainties.

Let us take Infosys for instance. BFSI is one of the largest revenue generators for the firm accounting for over 30 percent of total revenue. It registered a strong double digit growth of 11.5 percent in constant currency even as the company said it continues to see softness from Europe and capital markets in the US.

So how was it able to achieve the growth? According to Nilanjan Roy, CFO, Infosys, the company's sharpened focus on its in-house financial digital platform Finacle and its acquisition of Stater played a significant part in it.

Finacle is a flagship product of Infosys and the company has seen significant traction for the product in recent times. In addition the company is also developing capabilities to cater to the growing demand in niche areas such as mortgage.

Infosys has seen similar growth across verticals buoyed by demand for digital transformation and investment by telecom service providers on 5G across the world. The company increased its revenue guidance its guidance from 7.5-9.5 percent to 8.5-10 percent for the year.

TCS and Wipro are also on the same path though they are more cautious about growth.

While TCS' Q1 results showcased slower than expected growth trajectory, Wipro's was disappointing given that Q1 is a seasonally weak quarter for the firm.

However, both the firms have ramped up their hiring in Q1 anticipating demand for the rest of the year.

Rajesh Gopinathan said that the company gave 30,000 offer letters to freshers in the first quarter. It recruited over 12,000 people in Q1, the highest for a first quarter in the last five years in anticipation of demand unfolding.

This is also a part of TCS' strategy to build and train talent in-house as it expands its platform capabilities.

TCS’s financial services product TCS BaNCS is gaining traction and saw seven new deal wins. Its blockchain solution Quartz won two clients in the first quarter.

In case of Wipro, Abidali Neemuchwala, CEO, said that Wipro is ramping up its talent pool, both freshers and lateral hires, as the company sees a strogn digital deal pipeline in the coming quarters.

The company on-boarded 6,000 freshers in Q1, a significant jump compared to Q1 in previous year, said Saurabh Govil, Chief Human Resources Officer, Wipro.

But many of its digital growth parameter saw decline in growth.

The company’s digital operations and platforms dipped 3.1 percent compared to the quarter ended March 2019. The modern application services segment dropped 1.7 percent sequentially and 0.9 percent YoY basis. Industrial and engineering services fell 1.2 percent sequentially and saw a marginal increase of 0.4 percent YoY.

Bhanumurthy BM, COO, Wipro, attributed the decline to project completions in application and engineering services and delay in the start of newer projects. ""In engineering services, we see softness. That is why you are not seeing the level of growth you see in YoY for other practices. If you see other capabilities, analytics, infrastructure services, as well as our digital operations have grown significantly well YoY. These are basic and fundamental for any digital strategy for any organisations,"" he added.

Digital, clearly, is the way forward.

But will high dependence on digital come with a cost? Probably.

Unlike legacy projects, digital projects are short and seasonal. Unless there is a continuous demand they are likely to pull the revenue down. This was what happened in Wipro’s case where key digital growth metrics of Wipro saw a decline this quarter.

An analyst told Moneycontrol earlier that the enterprises need to find a balance between legacy/traditional projects that are long term and new age digital projects that are short term.",734,0.18327849752762737

Technology stocks gained momentum on July 15 with the Nifty IT index rising nearly 3 percent outperforming other sectoral indices after Infosys surged during the day.

Infosys touched a record high of Rs 781.65, rising more than 7 percent, followed by Oracle Financial, Tech Mahindra, TCS and Mindtree that gained 1-3 percent. Wipro and HCL Technologies also traded higher with moderate gains.

Infosys raised its full-year constant currency revenue guidance to 8.5-10 percent after reporting revenue growth of 2.3 percent, which was better than its closest peer TCS (1.6 percent), though profit fell 6.8 percent sequentially.

Brokerages also raised price target on the stock, saying the risk-reward is favourable and guidance revision alluded company's confidence in its pipeline and large deal wins.

The revised capital allocation to 85 percent from 70 percent earlier also turned positive for the stock.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is an IT services, consulting & business solutions provider that has been partnering with the world’s largest businesses in their transformation journeys for over past fifty years.

The company has grown consistently at industry leading growth rates on the back of its strategy of adding new clients, winning large deals and co-innovating with customers.

TCS has delivered a double digit revenue CAGR of 10.5 percent in the last three years. Its revenue has grown from Rs 10, 86,460 million in FY-16 to Rs 14, 64,630 million in FY-19.

TCS strong TCV wins, improving YoY growth in BFSI, all-round vertical growth, rising digital revenue and healthy Q4 exit rate drive confidence on underlying momentum, and we expect the IT major to comfortably post double-digit revenue growth in FY20E.

We expect growth momentum to continue in FY20, given deal wins of USD 6.2 billion in Q4-FY19.

The progress of monsoon would be actively tracked by traders and investors. Further, earnings announcement by companies is likely to lead to stock-specific volatility, Ajit Mishra, Vice President, Research, Religare Broking Ltd, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts:

Q: Where do you see Nifty this week?

A: The market is expected to remain choppy in the backdrop of weak domestic sentiments given on-going economic slowdown in the week. The monsoon has shown considerable improvement over the past 1-2 weeks which is positive for the Indian economy.

However, the progress of monsoon would be actively tracked by traders and investors. Further, the earnings announcement by companies is likely to lead to stock-specific volatility.

On the global front, on-going geopolitical tensions between US-Iran could have a bearing on Indian markets as crude price has inched higher and is likely to keep the market participants on edge.

Technically, Nifty is trading under pressure and has got a stiff resistance at 11,600. On charts, indications are still in favour of further consolidation. For this week, Nifty is expected to be in the range of 11,400-11,800.

Q: What are the important trigger to watch out this week? Alos, post their Q1 show, what is your view on TCS and Infosys?

A: In the coming week investors focus would be on the on-going corporate earnings season, WPI data and the geopolitical tensions between US-Iran.

Besides, they would actively track the progress of monsoon as it has shown considerable improvement over the past 1-2 weeks, which is positive for the Indian economy.

Further, these factors would influence market participant’s sentiments in the coming week. Infosys has delivered encouraging numbers for Q1FY20 on all counts and has increased its revenue growth guidance for FY20.

We believe Infosys and TCS are fundamentally sound with good growth potential in the long term. Hence, one can remain invested or accumulate the stocks on dips for healthy returns over the long term.

Q: SEBI has made it mandatory to disclose detailed reasons for share pledging. How should investors look at it?

A: In recent times, the market sentiments have been hurt badly due to the emergence of corporate governance issues. Especially, for companies that have a higher proportion of pledged shares by promoters. Investors have turned cautious, as such counters have been witnessing a free fall in their share prices.

Dismal financial performance along with the struggle to manage the existing debt by high debt-laden companies has compelled their lenders to sell the pledged shares of promoters, thus raising concerns for retail investors.

Hence, to protect the retail investors’ wealth, SEBI’s recent tightening of disclosure norms on pledged shares appears to be encouraging.

Widening the scope of encumbrance by including negative lien and NDUs (Non-Disposal Undertaking) is a welcome move, as it would help in tightening disclosure norms by promoters and result in improved transparency.

We feel investors should strictly avoid investing in all those companies involving a high level of pledging by promoters, as it reflects deteriorating fundamentals along with the company’s inability to raise funds through other viable options. Such stocks could continue to witness high volatility.

Q: About 300 BSE500 companies are trading below their 200-DMA. Are they attractive buys at current levels or investors should wait for the trend to reverse?

A: Most of these companies have reported subdued financial performance led by a slowdown or regulatory concerns in their respective sectors. The companies are fundamentally sound but are witnessing challenges currently.

The near term outlook also remains subdued for these companies given the on-going economic slowdown and persistent headwinds for respective companies.

Hence, further correction cannot be ruled out in the given names, but it would be advisable that investors with no exposure to these companies can start accumulating in a phased manner.

Q: Adding to the previous question, the trend is strong for 200 stocks. Are they attractive buy ideas?

A: Despite a challenging environment, the above companies have delivered strong financial performance and the stocks have seen considerable up move in the past six months.

We believe that these companies have strong growth prospects and have sound fundamentals and continue to command premium valuations.

However, given the recent run-up, it would be prudent to accumulate these stocks on dips (8-10 percent) as any slowdown in business could lead to some correction in these companies.

India’s two largest IT majors announced their results last week, which were in contrast to each other when it came to growth and attrition.

Growth

If TCS’ slow growth surprised industry watchers, Infosys surprised them with its strong growth.

TCS was cautious yet confident on growth where Infosys was positive and even increased its revenue guidance from 7.5-9.5 percent to 8.5-10 percent for the full year FY20.

What had changed? The growth, analysts said, came at the back of strong deal wins at $2.7 billion, its highest ever for a quarter. Like its CEO Salil Parekh said, the company has a seen double digit growth across most sectors. Its digital strategy, both organic and inorganic, is paying off with close to 36 percent of revenue coming from digital.

If you take banking, the company had grown 11.3 percent in constant currency as opposed to 9.3 percent for TCS. This is significant considering that banks have been cautious with their investments.

This caution was in part what pulled the growth down for TCS, for whom BFSI is one of the largest revenue generators.

Nilanjan Roy, CFO, Infosys had attributed the growth to the company’s banking product platform Finacle and the acquisition of Stater in May 2019.

But it was not just that though. Infosys was also able capitalize on the growing investment in the 5G space, which reflected in the 22 percent growth the company saw in the first quarter. The company working with telecom players across the world for developing 5G networks.

If you take BFSI for instance, the company has invested in developing capabilities in the mortgage space, where there is a gap in the US market. Close to Rs 1,000 crore investment was made by Infosys in the acquisition of Stater and leveraging its own platform Finacle. It was able to turn the tide in its favour in BFSI despite weakness in the sector.

Roy said the company is looking to develop similar sub-sectoral capabilities across various segment. This probably explains that company’s confidence in reaching the new revenue guidance.

Attrition

However, the growth on the back of high attrition rates has raised eyebrows. This is again in contrast to TCS’, which is able to maintain its attrition rate at 11.5 percent. For Infosys it stood at 23.4 percent, one of the highest Infosys has seen.

Parekh explained that while the quarter accounts for seasonally high attrition, this includes involuntary attrition as well. He did not offer further explanation on layoff numbers or the net number of employees added in Q1.

Layoffs aside, the recruitment plan for FY18, which stood at 18,000, is less compared to the number of people leaving the company.

TCS in Q1 saw the highest every addition of employees for a quarter at 12, 356 in the last five years. UB Pravin Rao told media persons in the press briefing that the attrition is not affecting the projects.

However question of at what cost the growth has come despite the high attrition remains.",509,0.44646357212747845

Major IT firms Wipro and TCS may have to dilute their promoter stake if the Budget proposal to increase public shareholding to 35 percent goes through.

In Budget 2019, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the government has recommended that the Security and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI) look at increasing the public shareholding to 35 percent from existing 25 percent for listed companies.

TCS and Wipro have promoter shareholding of 72.05 percent and 73.8 percent respectively. This is well below the 35 percent recommended.

According to a report by Jefferies Equity Research, a computer services and IT consulting firm, though the move is still at proposal stage, if such a rule is enforced, it would require significant stake sales by the promoters of TCS and Wipro.

TCS and Wipro will have to dilute close to 7.05 percent and 8.8 percent shares respectively. According to the report, the potential offer size for shares would be close to $8.3 billion for TCS and $2.2 billion for Wipro.

Other IT companies that have over 65 percent promoter shareholding include L&T Infotech and L&T Technology Services.

What would it mean for companies and investors?

Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD, Ingovern Research Services, a proxy advisory firm, said that this increase in public shareholding will lead to better liquidity for investors.

""But a few large Indian companies and most MNCs would be affected by this minimum public shareholding agreement,"" he said.

As promoters of large companies are forced to offload shares, it could depress share prices too, he added.

Subramaniam said: ""MNCs may explore alternative of delisting.""

However Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO, TCS, said that the company has nothing to share at this point on minimum public shareholding as it is investor-led.

Buybacks

The Budget also announced tax of 20 percent on buyback of shares effective immediately.

IT majors have been using the buyback route for returning excess cash to shareholders given its tax advantages. Currently buybacks are not taxed, whereas dividends attract a tax of 15 percent.

According to a Jefferies Equity Research report, over the last three years, top five IT firms have returned $12 billion.

Last year, TCS announced buyback worth Rs 16,000 crore and HCL Tech kicked off its Rs 4000 crore buyback in September 2018. Recently Infosys announced close to Rs 8000 crore buyback. Close to 60 percent of the buyback has been completed, Salil Parekh said in its 38th annual general meeting last month.

""Going forward, IT services companies will need to decide whether they still want to opt for buy-back route given limited tax advantages,"" the report added.

Another analyst said more companies will probably take the dividend route.",451,-0.1131324052810669

CNBC-TV18 spoke to Rajesh Gopinathan, Managing Director & CEO; NG Subramaniam, COO; V Ramakrishnan, CFO and Milind Lakkad, EVP Global Head-HR of TCS about the results.

Talking about the softness in growth, Gopinathan said: ""BFSI, we had already spoken about, some emerging softness that we saw in the capital markets part of it and the European banks that has turned out to be more than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. Then there are some individual ones like retail is more of this quarter impact but the company has hopes that it will come back up by next quarter itself.""

Also read: What should investors do with TCS post Q1 results: buy, sell or hold?

When asked if the macros were a little more uncertain than a couple of months ago, Gopinathan said: ""We are focused on near-term and long-term and what is encouraging is that many of the strategies that we put in place for getting back double-digit revenue growth. Focus on digital, investments in front-end capabilities on the experience part of it, analytics, automation all of these are resonating strongly with customers.

""I am happy that revenue strategy, which took us back to double-digit growth, continues to be extremely relevant to our customers. The short-term impact of what happens in the market is beyond us to predict,"" he added.

Talking about the BFSI vertical, Subramaniam said: ""The capital markets and the European banks which we called out got accentuated in the quarter and that’s something that is reflected in our performance in the BFSI sector.""

""However, if I focus on each of the customers and what they are looking at to deliver, the kind of deal wins that we have had and where is it that they would like us to focus. Absolutely, there is no concern that I have per se beyond the capital markets and things that we pointed out,"" he added.

When asked what it would take for the company to get back to the aspirational 26-28 percent margin band, Ramakrishnan said, “Of course currency will be a factor because rupee depreciation is part of our model. In recent few months we have seen significant currency appreciation, so that will be a definite factor. We have always maintained that temporary blips and currencies can be baked into the model but if there is a significant sustained appreciation that will have an impact.”

""However, it is important to see what other things we can continue to do and so we have been focused on significantly building a lot of capabilities both in technology as well as domain and also in terms of building our own intellectual property, assets in terms of products and platforms and that continues,"" said Ramakrishnan.

With regards to hiring, Lakkad said, ""It was a good thing that they could hire people quicker, faster – getting them on board, training them on time and then deploying them quickly because we are seeing demand and we will not be constrained by supply going forward.""

On full-year hiring trajectory, Lakkad said, ""We offered 30,000 campus offers. Every quarter we look at the demand and based on that we hire people from market.""

""At about 40 percent of that 30,000 are already on-board and the rest we expect to join between Q2 and Q3,"" Ramakrishnan added.

Arihant Capital 's research report on TCS

TCS came out with mixed set of numbers in Q1FY20, revenue and EBIT margin were slightly below our as well as street estimate; however PAT for the quarter was ahead of our estimate owing to higher other income. Digital business continued to show traction, though BFSI vertical remained on a weak footing. We are positive on the stock from longer term perspective, however in the near term we see limited upside due to expensive valuation and tepid management commentary.

Outlook

We maintain our HOLD rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2225 (unchanged).

This number, which consisted of quite a few who began their careers with the company, rose from 91 employees in FY17. The data excluded salaries drawn by CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, COO NG Subramaniam, and internationally-based executives. The compensation data included salary, allowances, cash incentive, the monetary value of perquisites as per Income Tax Rules and the company’s contribution to provident and superannuation fund.

Among the topmost earners, Life Sciences, healthcare and public services head Debashis Ghosh earned over Rs 4.7 crore; business and technology services head Krishnan Ramanujam took home more than Rs 4.1 crore; banking, financial services and insurance business head K Krithivasan earned over Rs 4.3 crore; chief technology officer K Ananth Krishnan got more than Rs 3.5 crore. Additionally, the former head of retail and consumer products Pratik Pal, who has since shifted to Tata Sons, drew over Rs 4.3 crore.

Moneycontrol couldn’t independently verify the report, and TCS did not respond to ET’s queries regarding the matter.

The paper also noted that TCS's oldest employee to be paid Rs 1 crore annually is 72-year-old Barinda Sanyal, the company's vice president of finance.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has been recognised among the top 50 companies in the US for diversity and inclusion management by excelling in areas as hiring, retaining and promoting women, minorities and people with disabilities. TCS was selected as one of DiversityInc's Top 50 Companies – out of more than 1,800 assessed organisations – for its sustained investments and efforts in diversity and inclusion, the company said in a statement.

TCS was ranked specifically for senior leadership accountability, talent programmes, workplace practices, philanthropy, and supplier diversity, it said.

The Top 50 analysis also addressed the intersectionality of race by analysing the representation of women and men in each race/ethnicity separately, rather than combined.

According to DiversityInc, TCS was at 49th place in the list.

“TCS' progressive and inclusive policies are helping us attract, nurture and retain diverse talent...Equally important is our work to expand access to opportunities for underserved and marginalised groups in the communities where we operate,"" said Balaji Ganapathy, Head, Workforce Effectiveness, TCS in the statement.

TCS provides business transformation services to customers across all 50 US states and DC, with a diverse local workforce that comprises 70 nationalities, and women making up 28 per cent of the base.

Since 2014, TCS has hired more than 20,000 Americans and is one of the nation's largest job creators in the Information Technology sector. This figure includes more than 1,500 recent college graduates, the statement said.",246,0.9998704195022583

The over $20-billion revenue company is also confident of expanding its play in large markets like continental Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand as it launches new services, products and platforms.

""...our share even in our largest markets is still in low single digits. We are only scratching the surface yet in large markets like continental Europe, Japan and Australia New Zealand. Market penetration will be a growth driver in the coming years,"" TCS Global Head (Business and Technology Services) Krishnan Ramanujam said in the company's annual report for 2018-19.

He added that emerging markets like Latin America, India and South Africa -- which have historically lagged in technology spending -- will see enterprises leapfrog into the 'Business 4.0' era and start spending.

Last year, TCS had introduced its 'Business 4.0' strategy -- a thought leadership framework to help customers leverage digital technologies to address their growth and transformation agendas.

About 53 percent of TCS' revenue came from Americas, 29.7 percent from Europe and 5.7 percent from India. Other geographies accounted for the remaining 11.36 percent.

""We keep expanding our addressable market by continually launching new services, products and platforms, catering to the needs of a broadening set of stakeholders... All this gives us greater confidence and visibility in our ability to sustain our market leading revenue growth,"" he noted.

The Mumbai-based company's consolidated net profit stood at Rs 31,562 crore, while its revenue was at Rs 1.46 lakh crore in FY 2018-19.

Apart from crossing the $20 billion revenue mark, TCS also became the first Indian company to achieve a market capitalisation of $100 billion in the last decade, and join the list of the top 100 most valuable companies in the world.

TCS COO N G Subramaniam said each time the company crossed a new milestone, it has only grown stronger, while retaining agility and entrepreneurial mindset.

""Today, we are not intimidated by scale. If anything, it has been a source of immense strength, giving us the ability to invest in many more capabilities all at once, and take on larger, more complex assignments,"" he said.

Subramaniam said TCS has maintained a very lean corporate structure and has been ""steadily devolving executive decision-making powers to lower and lower levels"".

""Diseconomies of scale arise from corporate bloat and bureaucracy that slows down decision making, and hinders responsiveness to changing market trends...Today, we have over 150 operating business units on the ground, each with its own P&L (profit and loss),"" he pointed out.

Five years ago, one would hardly find the mention of overseas hiring in annual reports of IT companies. Now overseas hiring, especially in the US, is one of the key points of discussion for the IT majors, thanks to the tightening visa regulations.

Since 2017, the Trump administration has been tightening the H-1B visa rules, provided to skilled migrant workers. This includes rising scrutinisation of visa applied by Indian IT services firms, ban on H-4 visa that enabled spouses of H-1B visa holders to work in the US and more importance to master degree holders from the US.

IT companies were one of the biggest beneficiaries of the visa and one of the worst affected as thousands of techies returned home due to rising rejection rates of H-1B visa.

This has made the coveted H-1B visa a constant headache in more ways than one for IT majors in the country. On one-hand, these companies have to cut-back on sending Indian techies overseas and on the other-hand there is a huge demand for new-age technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and cloud as new projects trickle in.

Enterprises are left with no option but to recruit overseas employees given that the US is the most important market.

Why is the US so important?

For most Indian IT companies, the US accounts for the about anywhere between 50-80 percent of their businesses. Europe, UK and others account for rest.

This translates to equivalent amount of Indian work force present in the country to handle the projects. However since 2017 the Indian overseas workforce began to come down due to visa rejections.

According to the data released by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) close to 60 percent of companies that applied for a visa on behalf of foreign workers received requests for additional information in the last quarter of 2018. It was 46 percent in 2017 and 28 percent in 2016. The approval rate fell to 75 percent in the final quarter of 2018 from 83 percent in 2017 and 92 percent in 2016.

Companies with large number of rejects were Indian firms such as TCS, Infosys, and Wipro.

Apart from new applications, H-1B renewals were a challenge too. ""Earlier, the Request for Evidence (RFEs), which required applicants to submit more documentation, for renewals was rare and they were hardly questioned. It is not the case anymore,"" said Pankai Joshi, Managing Director, NYSA Global, a firm that specialises in EB-5 migration visas.

Changing hiring pattern

Now most of the companies are rejigging their hiring pattern to factor in the visa challenges.

Yugal Joshi, Vice President, Everest Group, a management consultancy firm, said, “Most of the Indian heritage service companies are trying to hire onshore talent as much for visa as for the political climate. A lot of them never used to visit campuses or hire fresh graduates, now they are doing it. This is a significant departure in their talent strategy.”

V Apparao, Chief Human Resources Officer at HCL Technologies, during the announcement of quarter three results said that the company will continue its localisation efforts that now stand at over 65 percent from single digit over a decade ago. He also said that the company is looking to hire more people overseas in the next fiscal.

Infosys has made a commitment to hire 10,000 locals by over a two year period in 2017. TCS and Wipro too are investing significantly in this space.

Subcontract hiring

Second part of the story is increase subcontract hiring. A senior leader in a major IT company said that the company is engaging more contract hiring to fill in the talent gap in the US.

Contract hiring is the most feasible option for companies as a resource/talent with a valid visa is mapped to the project based on its requirement. Since it is fixed term, the contract ends when the project ends unlike when employees are on bench overseas, incurring unnecessary cost.

Nisha V is on overseas bench now as her project got over. “The company office is 40 miles away from where I stay. There is no point in going to office since there is no work. I’m waiting for a project to be assigned soon,” she said.

Contract hiring eliminates these issues though it comes at a cost. Kris Lakshmikanth, founder and CEO, Head Hunters India, an IT staffing firm said for most companies the margins have come down by 200 basis points as IT majors are spending more on overseas talents.

Joshi of Everest Group, said, “Increased subcontracting costs indicate they aren't hiring or don't plan or are unwilling to hire as much talent as is the demand. This talent management is a key to their business success as they don't want to build bench at onshore location.”

Umesh Belludi, Co-founder, BrainHR, a HR consultancy firm based in Bengaluru, agrees. Belludi’s firm specialises in processing H-1B for Indian IT firms and also map them to the right company. ""But that business has come down by 30-35 percent since the US started imposing visa regulations,"" he said.

With the demand for contract hiring on the rise, his company has moved on to working with valid H-1B visa holders in the US, green card holders and citizens to match them with the right company.

A blessing in disguise

Akhilesh Tuteja, Global Co-Leader - Cyber Security at KPMG, agrees that overseas hiring comes at cost and lowers operating margin. ""But these visa issues might be a blessing in disguise,"" he added.

Though the distance does not make client retention a huge issue, according to him proximity to clients does increase the trust factor. Salil Parekh in his recent interaction with CNBC TV-18 said that the company is staying more and more relevant to the client as it opens new offices outside India and hiring talents locally.

Infosys plans to open four technology and innovation centre in the US. Infosys also said that it will hire 1,200 people in Australia and open three offices there. HCL Technologies has opened 134 delivery centres outside India.

However this has not changed the acquisition strategy that are focused on building digital capabilities. According to a market analyst, acquisitions continue to be for capabilities and leveraging offshore factories to support onshore centric model of acquired firms be it in design, digital, or any next gen theme. ""The agenda is to leverage global service delivery to scale up the capabilities of acquired firm,"" the analyst added.

India’s largest IT firm TCS was recently in the news for a trade secret theft case filed by US-based tech firm CSC.

Given that it is not the first such suit against the IT firm, rather its third after the Epic Systems case, and the Simonelli Innovation Inc case that was later dismissed by a Texas court, analysts say the incident does raise questions about lackadaisical view Indian firms have on intellectual property (IP), lack of guidelines and enforcement for the same.

Mahindra Satyam had also earlier settled an IP infringement lawsuit filed by UPaid, which offers solutions for payments via mobile phone, for $70 million. The suit was filed by UPaid in 2007.

""Indian firms do not take intellectual property concerns seriously. These incidents will force companies to put in stringent guidelines in place and enforce them,"" said Pareekh Jain of technology consulting firm Pareekh Consulting.

Jain cautioned that larger implication of such cases will be that companies will be more cautious while outsourcing services and put stringent guidelines for IT services firms to follow.

At the same time, the incidents may not seriously dent TCS' reputation.

What is the lawsuit about?

Last month, US tech firm CSC filed a lawsuit in the US court accusing TCS of improperly accessing its proprietary code to build an insurance platform for the US market. A week later, TCS responded to the allegation in the court stating that lawsuit of CSC lacks evidence and it is aimed at disrupting its $2 billion business deal with Transamerica.

The case is similar to the two others filed against TCS by Epic Systems and Simonelli Innovation Inc.

Let us take Epic Systems case where TCS has levied a penalty of $420 million.

The US-based healthcare software company Epic Systems had implemented its healthcare management system in the Kaiser Permanente (KP), healthcare service provider. TCS was hired to test the system implementation. Epic systems had restricted TCS access to consultants, which limits TCS’ access to Epic's documents.

Despite that, Epic Systems alleged that TCS employees used a KP employee's credentials to steal over 6,000 documents that contain Epic System's development information. Deepak Shenoy in his post said the case was exposed when a whistleblower inside TCS warned KP and Epic about the issue.

In 2014, the company filed a lawsuit against TCS for stealing its intellectual property to develop its own product. ""The company did not misuse or derive any benefit from Epic's documents and plans to defend its position vigorously before the trial judge as well as in appeal,"" TCS said in the filing as quoted by The Economic Times.

The US court in 2016 penalised TCS for $940 million. This was later brought down to $420 million to comply with an existing legal limit on punitive damages. TCS is fighting the case in a federal court.

The Simonelli case

After the Epic case, TCS faced another lawsuit from Simonelli Innovation Inc that alleged the IT major for wrongful and improper use of Simonelli's intellectual property (IP) and trade secrets to build its own consulting practice.

A Mint article, quoting the lawsuit filed by Simonelli on August 15, 2018 said: ""This case is being brought because TCS and TAIC (Tata America International Corp.) agreed to keep the IP and trade secrets of Simonelli Innovation confidential and to only use same in projects under the 'Alliance Agreement' that would mutually benefit both entities.

""Despite this, the defendants (TCS) took the methodology and foundation given to them by plaintiff (Simonelli), and used it to transform their consulting options, obtain customers and increase revenue without including the plaintiff as required by the ‘Alliance Agreement’ contract between the parties,"" the article said.

However, in response to an email query from Moneycontrol, Simonelli said: ""Plaintiff and Defendants have resolved all claims in this lawsuit and, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(ii), Plaintiff stipulates that Plaintiff’s claims against Defendants should be dismissed with prejudice, with each party responsible for its own costs and fees.""

Analysts said these incidents are unlikely to affect the reputation of TCS from a business point of view.

""The TCS brand has taken a little hit in the developer community. But from business point of view, most understand that litigation is a separate area and might not cause an impact,"" said Jain of Pareekh Consulting.

According to Jain, with IT firms now getting into the development of products and platforms, there needs to be 'Chinese wall' between products and services.

Yugal Joshi, Vice President, Everest Group, a consulting firm, agrees that IP charges are not uncommon. However, Joshi pointed out that most service providers do deliver platform-based services and therefore need to further enhance their governance mechanism. In addition, they need to further educate their workforce on enforcing such a mechanism.

""Also, service providers should not buckle under the pressure of growth. Many employees may end up taking unintended and non-malicious short cuts and find themselves violating the IP ownership,"" he added.

It was a short week for the market, but Nifty remained highly volatile within the range. It failed to surpass 11,800 but managed to survive above 11,648, which is the highest low of the current up move. The close above the highest low of the current up move is positive for the market.

On 25th April 2019, Nifty formed a lower high and quickly reversed, which was negative for the broader market.

Since then, the Nifty has not fallen, even though the market breadth remained weak. It implies that the market is consolidating, narrowing its range and preparing to break the level of 11,800 decisively.

However, until the market is not crossing the same, we should be a buyer at supports or at a break out with a minimal stop loss.

Contra traders should look for short selling opportunity around 11,750/11,760 with a final stop loss at 11,810. Our view is to trade in one direction as the market trend could puzzle and make it extremely difficult to move with the tide.

For the week, trend followers should look to short if Nifty drops below 11,630. Buying is advisable above 11,810 as it would move to 11,900 or even 12,000 without any major difficulties.

Below 11,630, the index has multi major supports at 11600, 11580, 11560, 11549 and 11500. However, short term trend followers must take a short bet on the index below 11,630 keeping a tight stop-loss at 11,700 for the same.

Our take for the week is to trade on both sides of the market with a minimal stop loss. We are hearing a lot of chaos on the street that very few stocks are keeping Nifty higher, which is not positive for the market.

As per our observations, ahead of every major event only a few stocks dominate and keep the market higher. The reason behind is “careful evaluation of stocks by experienced participants of the market”.

We need to ask ourselves that why would anyone take a risk in stocks which have no impactful weight on the index like Coal India, Cipla, Hindalco, BPCL, GAIL, and ZEEL?

There focus is on the top 10 companies, which are fundamentally sound and have an adequate free float in the market.

Across the globe, the scenario is the same and very few companies that are fundamentally sound help the market to move either higher or lower.

In India, top 10 companies like HDFC Bank, HDFC LTD, RIL, SBI, Infosys, TCS, L&T, Bajaj Finance, HUL, and ITC are contributing nearly 65 percent to the index and which is the reason why ahead of major events, we see activity in few stocks.

At 11:21 hrs, the Nifty IT index was trading at 16,191.35, down 1.29 percent. All the constituent stocks were trading in the negative, with TCS being the biggest loser, down 2.05 percent.

Other major losers were, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies, down 1.68 percent and 1.51 percent, respectively.

The index was the biggest sectoral loser on NSE.

Cognizant forecast 2019 revenue growth in the range of 3.6 percent and 5.1 percent in constant currency terms, compared with between 7 percent and 9 percent earlier.

Chief Financial Officer Karen McLoughlin said the company was seeing some cautiousness in the banking sector around levels of spending in the second half of the year.

The company's reliance on the financial services sector has been weighing on its overall revenue growth in the past few quarters.

Revenue in its financial services unit fell 1.7 percent to $1.44 billion in the first quarter, while healthcare services revenue rose nearly 4 percent to $1.17 billion but missed the $1.20 billion forecast by three analysts polled by Refinitiv.

India’s largest IT services provider TCS said in a court filing that the allegation by tech firm CSC, about TCS improperly using its proprietary software, lacked evidence and an injunction would harm the company’s and its partner Transamerica’s business operations.

TCS responded after CSC last week sued it for accessing its source code to build an insurance platform for the US market.

In the lawsuit filed in Texas, CSC alleged that TCS is “improperly accessing and using CSC’s proprietary software to develop the TCS product and steal CSC’s customers.” CSC is seeking punitive damages for the same.

In the court filing, TCS said, “CSC has known for over one year about the access that these TCS employees have to Vantage.”

On June 2018, CSC's parent company DXC took up the matter of Transamerica employees using CSC's proprietary information.

“Yet, CSC did not file suit at that time, or in the subsequent ten months, alleging that this conduct was illegal or improper or that TCS was misappropriating its trade secrets. Nor did it communicate in any manner with TCS prior to its filing of this action,” the statement added.

CSC had licensed Vantage and CyberLife to Money Services Inc (MSI), a Transamerica affiliate since 1994. In 2014, MSI began using TCS to provide support to maintain its IT systems. This included maintenance of some of CSC’s software systems that resided on MSI’s servers.

In January 2018, TCS partnered with Transamerica in a 10-year deal worth over $2 billion. The IT major said it would use its BaNCS software system to offer insurance processing services. As a part of the deal, TCS also hired 2,200 Transamerica (or MSI) employees, who have been administering and processing policies using CSC software systems.

CSC said in the lawsuit that some of these employees still had access to the company’s source code and other confidential and proprietary CSC information as a part of its licensing agreement.

The TCS filing in the court also names CSC employee Ashish Barnwal, who worked closely with TCS employees to help the company transition from Vantage to TCS' platform in the same office.

The statement further briefed that the email conversation CSC is basing its allegation on is nothing more than a “routine request from Transamerica to certain knowledgeable employees of its service provider, TCS.”

TCS court brief elaborated that Barnwal has routinely offered his assistance and it was him who forwarded the source code when the calculation in question came up.

“In those email communications, Transamerica is attempting to understand how it is currently conducting a calculation so that it can make a decision on how to do it going forward on the platforms of its third-party service providers,” the filing stated.

In addition, TCS brief mentioned that the development team for BaNCS, which is based in Kolkata and Transamerica team is kept organisationally and physically separate.

""Likely upset about Transamerica’s decision to transition from Vantage to TCS’s BaNCS Platform, CSC appears determined to disrupt the legitimate business relationship between Transamerica and TCS,"" the statement added.

“The injunction CSC seeks could also potentially harm TCS’s reputation with its customers, particularly if CSC disparages TCS for its own competitive gain,” the brief said.

This is not the first case where TCS was accused of trade secret theft. In 2014, the US firm Epic System filed a similar lawsuit against TCS and won. TCS was levied a penalty of $420 million. The company is fighting the case in the federal court.

Banking and financial services and insurance is one of the key verticals for TCS. According to analysts such incidents will have an impact on the brand's image for a short-term.",619,-0.9422388332230704

Computer Sciences Corp (CSC) is suing India’s largest IT major TCS for accessing CSC’s source code to build its own insurance platform for the US market.

In the lawsuit filed in Texas on last week by the US-based IT services firm, the company has alleged that TCS is “improperly accessing and using CSC’s proprietary software to develop the TCS product and steal CSC’s customers.” CSC is seeking punitive damages for the same.

This is the second such lawsuit against the IT major. The first case was by Epic Systems, which alleged that TCS stole its documents. While the initial fine was close to $940 million, it was later brought down to $420 million by another court. TCS has appealed against this in a federal court.

“TCS is aware of CSCs court filing. Our legal team is reviewing the allegations and will respond appropriately. TCS BaNCS is a comprehensive product with several successful implementations globally. TCS will strongly defend its position before the court. As this is a pending legal matter, TCS would not like to comment further at this time,” a TCS spokesperson told Moneycontrol.

CSC is a subsidiary of DXC Technology Corporation and owns software platforms such as Vantage and CyberLife to process life insurance and annuity policies. The company licensed the two platforms to Money Services Inc (MSI) since 1994. The suit said that MSI processed close to 10 million life insurance and annuity policies of TransAmerica, its parent company.

In 2014, MSI began using TCS to provide support to maintain its IT systems. This included maintenance of some of CSC’s software systems that resided on MSI’s servers.

In January 2018, TCS partnered with TransAmerica in a 10-year deal worth over $2 billion. The IT major said that it would use its BaNCS software system to offer insurance processing services.

As a part of the deal, TCS hired 2,200 TransAmerica (or MSI) employees, who have been administering and processing policies using CSC software systems. CSC said in the lawsuit that some of these employees still had access to the company’s source code and other confidential and proprietary CSC information as a part of its licensing agreement.

CSC said in its lawsuit, “TCS is using this access to and knowledge of the CSC source code, software documentation, and other proprietary and confidential CSC information to develop TCS’ BaNCS for the US.”

The lawsuit further pointed out that CSC learned at the end of March 2019 that the TCS employees assigned to developing its BaNCS platform encountered difficulties devising a software solution and used CSC’s Vantage source code for the same.

“Over the course of three weeks, TCS employees then accessed and analysed both the proprietary CSC software documentation and the Vantage source code to try to determine the method and process by which Vantage calculates this particular rate of return,” CSC said in its lawsuit.

“Unless TCS is stopped from proceeding with these unjust efforts, TCS will be able to develop and launch a life insurance and annuities platform that is based on business and software solutions brazenly stolen from CSC,” the lawsuit added.

According to Statista, the US was the leading life insurance premium-writing country in 2017, with a total value of life direct premiums written amounting to $546.8 billion.

The lawsuit explained that the misappropriation of CSC’s trade secrets would allow TCS to develop BaNCS into a competitive product emulating CSC’s successful products, reduce the investment of time and resources, and be a short-cut to the otherwise years-long development process.

“Having learned nothing from the outcome of the Epic litigation or the massive judgment entered against it, TCS continues to improperly access, copy and make improper use of CSC’s source code, trade secrets and proprietary information,” lawsuit added.

In addition to damages, the company is also seeking permanent injunction to prevent TCS and its employees from using CSC’s source code to develop BaNCS platform.",657,-0.6204754965645927

In 2013, the Mumbai-based company had announced receiving an over Rs 1,100- crore multi-year contract from the Department of Posts (DoP) for an end-to-end IT modernisation programme.

The partnership was aimed at equipping India Post with modern technologies and systems to enable it to offer more services to the customers in an effective manner.

""At the heart of this transformation is the Core System Integration (CSI) program designed and implemented by TCS. This involved deploying an integrated ERP solution that caters to mail operations, finance and accounting, and HR functions, and connects its vast network of more than 1.5 lakh post offices, making this the largest distributed e-postal network in the world,"" TCS said in a statement.

The integrated solution supports requirements of over five lakh employees, services over 40,000 concurrent users, and processes over three million postal transactions a day, making this one of the largest SAP implementations globally, it added.

On the front-end, TCS said, it has implemented its Point of Sale (PoS) solution across 24,000 post offices with over 80,000 PoS terminals and has also built a web portal with consignment tracking capabilities, and set up a multi-lingual call centre for customer support.

""An important objective of the transformation is to use the department's nation-wide reach to drive financial inclusion and accessibility of citizen services in remote areas.

""This is being accomplished through over 1.3 lakh DARPAN 1 hand-held devices that Gramin Dak Sevaks use to provide postal, banking, insurance, and cash management services in remote villages, even those without network connectivity,"" TCS said.

TCS Business Group Head (Public Services) Debashis Ghosh said postal services across the world are reinventing themselves to stay relevant to a new generation in the digital era.

""We are proud to have partnered with the Department of Posts in this pioneering, mission mode initiative to build a world class, future-ready digital platform that the nation can be proud of.

Oil & gas major, RIL gained 4.06 percent for the week after it reported a 9.8 percent growth in the fourth quarter with a consolidated net profit of Rs 10,362 crore. This was driven by a 19.4 percent increase in quarterly revenue to Rs 1.54 lakh crore.

The company attributed the robust revenue performance to strong growth in its retail and digital services businesses which grew by 51.6 percent and 61.6 percent, respectively. Higher petrochemical volumes also contributed to growth in revenue, the company said.

IT major Tata Consultancy Services surged close to 5 percent for the week after it reported the strongest revenue growth in the last 15 quarters clocking a revenue growth of 2.4 percent QoQ.

Though the EBIT margin of the company was marginally down at 25.2 percent, against expectations of 25.7 percent. Global brokerage firms also reaffirmed their faith in India's largest software services exporter by revenue as they upgraded the stock.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has partnered with Israel's Finance Ministry to make technology affordable for small banks in the country, according to a report in The Economic Times.

""In India, we created a core banking platform and have taken it to other markets. Having developed the first one, the Ministry of Finance wanted us to set-up a complete banking service bureau in Israel,"" N Ganapathy Subramaniam, Chief Operating Officer at TCS, told the newspaper.

Moneycontrol couldn’t independently verify the report.

Israel-based Bank Yahav began using the TCS BaNCS Universal Banking platform in 2017.

""The Ministry wanted to move beyond the big three or four big banks. They want new banks to come up at affordable technology, so that they can quickly adopt technology that straightaway goes to an open banking concept,"" Subramaniam told the newspaper.

Open banking allows banks to share details about transactions with other financial institutions through application programming interfaces (APIs).

The practice of open banking will likely widen the playing field in Israel’s credit sector, which is currently dominated by large banks and financial institutions.

""Banking platforms are significant for TCS. Platforms are the way to go. It gives faster go-to market for IT firms. It can be used by clients with minimum customisation,"" the report quoted Urmil Shah, a research analyst with brokerage IDBI Capital, as saying.

TCS in February made its BaNCS platform available on Amazon Web Services. The IT bellwether is not the only Indian company with a presence in Israel. Flipkart too is expanding its presence in Israel after acquiring analytics startup Upstream Commerce in 2018.",273,

Dolat Capital's research report on TCS

The management is confident of strong growth in FY20 despite macro-economic challenges in the environment. The company signed TCV of USD 6.3bn during the quarter and TCV of USD 21.9bn for FY19 which gives us comfort for the growth trajectory in FY20. We expect a USD revenue growth of 9%/10% in USD terms for FY20/FY21, which factors in healthy growth in the BFSI vertical. The company maintained its aspirational margin band of 26%-28% despite visa rejection and talent shortage; we expect TCS to deliver margin towards lower end of its guidance. We downgrade our earnings estimate by 1.8%/6% for FY20/FY21 due revision in rupee assumption to ` 70 for FY20/FY21 (vs ` 72/` 74 for FY20/FY21 earlier).

Outlook

However, we maintain our ACCUMULATE rating with a revised TP of ` 2,225 based on 22x (20x earlier) one-year fwd. PER. We upgraded our multiple on back of strong deal win and order book which will help company deliver healthy growth over the next two years.
