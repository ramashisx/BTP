The shareholders of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) approved the appointment of Anant Ambani, the younger son of billionaire Mukesh Ambani, to the board of the company by an overwhelming majority, shrugging off the advice of two proxy advisory firms that had urged them to vote against the resolution.

Anant Ambani's appointment as non-executive director of RIL was approved by a whopping 92.2 percent of the company's shareholders, according to the results declared on October 27. The shareholders also approved the appointment of his older siblings Isha Ambani and Akash Ambani as non-executive directors.

Two proxy advisory firms — Institutional Investor Advisory Services India Ltd (IiAS) and International proxy firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) — had urged RIL shareholders to defeat the proposal to appoint Anant Ambani to the board.

IiAS had cited Anant Ambanis's age (28) as the reason for its objection, which it said doesn't align with its voting guidelines. ISS had expressed concerns about his limited leadership experience.

Both proxy firms had supported the appointments of Isha and Akash Ambani, who are 31 years old.

Ingovern, a third proxy advisory firm, supported the appointment of all three siblings as non-executive directors to the RIL Board.

RIL, founded by the siblings’ late grandfather Dhirubhai Ambani, had sought shareholder approval through a remote e-voting process for their appointments as non-executive directors. The e-voting started on September 27 and closed on October 26, following a postal ballot notice on September 25.

RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani had spoken about mentoring his three children for leadership roles in the company for the next five years at the company's annual general meeting in August. The board's recommendation for the three appointments was seen as the initiation of a succession plan for the company's future.",329,-0.9999572038650513

Reliance Brands Limited (RBL), through its wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom (RBUK), on October 4, signed a definitive agreement to enter into a joint venture with UK-based Superdry PLC, marking a significant new chapter in its partnership with the firm. The joint venture entity will acquire Superdry's intellectual property assets for the India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh territories.

RBUK and Superdry will own 76 percent and 24 percent of the joint venture entity, respectively. The consideration for the IP is £40 million, which is estimated to result in Superdry PLC receiving gross cash proceeds worth £30.4 million (approximately £28.3 million net of fees and taxes) from RBUK.

RBL had inked a long-term franchise agreement with Superdry PLC in 2012 and introduced the brand in India.

“This strategic evolution of brand ownership aims to capitalise on the increasing affluence and evolving consumption patterns of Indian shoppers. Coupled with Reliance Brand’s appetite to invest in accelerating Indian consumption narrative, the deal paves the way for Superdry’s future expansion in the country and neighbouring territories,” the company said in a release.

“This announcement represents a natural progression in the brand's ongoing success and popularity in India. The new partnership will enable deeper collaboration between RBL and Superdry PLC, facilitating new sourcing channels, as well as the introduction of India-centric product categories, cost optimization, and long-term investments in brand development,” it added.

Darshan Mehta, MD of Reliance Brands Limited, commented on the development and said, “Superdry has come to define urban cool in India for more than a decade. The journey has been rewarding and fun in equal parts due to working with the hugely talented Superdry team and the sense of camaraderie led by Julian. I look forward with excitement to this new era of our partnership.”

Superdry, which has carved a niche among young Indian consumers, has expanded rapidly to 200 points of sale across 50 cities. E-commerce continues to drive incremental growth for the brand, boosting its reach beyond 2,300 cities in India, underlining RBL-run Superdry India operations as the largest franchisee network of the brand globally, the Reliance Brands release added.

Bollywood actor Kartik Aryan has also been associated with Superdry since 2022 in the capacity of a brand ambassador, featuring prominently in brand campaigns and new launches.

Notably, Superdry UK will maintain a stake in the brand for the Indian territory and will continue to support brand development through sharing expertise in design, product development, and marketing.

Julian Dunkerton, Superdry’s CEO and Founder, said: “We are pleased to be announcing this IP agreement with our long-term partners, Reliance. India represents an incredible opportunity for Superdry, and our excellent existing relationship with Reliance means we will be able to hit the ground running. Under our new partnership, I am confident that the brand will continue to accelerate and build on our success to date to become a major force in the Indian fashion market.”

2023-09-19 08:18:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hydrogen-boom-after-the-centre-states-begin-to-roll-out-green-hydrogen-policies-11390091.html,"The Indian government is also planning to use green hydrogen and green ammonia as energy storage systems.

After the central government’s announcements regarding incentives to promote green hydrogen production and electrolyser manufacturing in India, states have now started rolling out their own green hydrogen policies and incentives.

The union government approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) on January 4 this year, hoping to become a leading producer and exporter of green hydrogen in the world by hitting an annual production of 5 million metric tons (MMT) by 2030.

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) accordingly rolled out the NGHM with an initial outlay of Rs 19,744 crore, of which Rs 17,490 crore is for incentives to produce green hydrogen (Rs 13,050 crore) and manufacture electrolysers (Rs 4,440 crore).

Now, a number of states are following suit, offering incentives on the production of the green gas and renewable energy which is needed to make hydrogen ‘green’; subsidies on transmission within their region; SGST reimbursement; government land allotments; and so on.

The good news for producers is that whatever the states offer in terms of subsidies or incentives under their own green hydrogen policies will be in addition to the schemes rolled out by the central government.

“We are seeing great response from states ever since the ministry launched India’s green hydrogen mission. Some states have come out with a green hydrogen policy, while a few others have included the new form of energy in their renewable energy policies. A number of states are working on such policies and will release them in the next few months,” said a senior MNRE official.

Also read: Green hydrogen as energy storage could be as low as Rs 6/kWh: RK Singh.

To avoid any confusion, on August 18, the MNRE released India’s standards for green hydrogen produced in the country. In that, the government has mandated that the carbon emission should not be more than two kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen. Carbon dioxide equivalent is a measure of the total greenhouse gases emitted, expressed in terms of the equivalent measure of carbon dioxide.

Asked if implementation of the central policy could be difficult due to states now bringing in their own policies, the official said it would be otherwise.

“States are free to offer any incentive or subsidy which promotes green hydrogen and renewable energy in their region. Whatever the states offer will be in addition to the incentives offered by the central government. It will be a win-win situation for producers. The definition of green hydrogen has also been released for the convenience of all states and union territories. So, states don’t have to look anywhere else. They will simply follow the standards issued by the Centre,” said the official, requesting anonymity.

Moneycontrol takes a look at some of the states which have released a green hydrogen policy or included it in their energy transition plans. Many states have already signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with several big corporates, including NTPC, Reliance, Adani, ArcelorMittal, and Torrent, which have pledged huge investments in green energy projects.

Andhra Pradesh

Only five months after the union cabinet approved the NGHM, the Andhra Pradesh government, on June 20, notified its own green hydrogen and green ammonia policy.

The state has set a green hydrogen production target of 0.5 MTPA (million tons per annum), and green ammonia production target of 2.0 MTPA, in the next five years by harnessing the renewable energy (RE) potential in the region.

Estimating that the AP government’s move will create 12,000 jobs per MTPA of green hydrogen produced, the government is intensively promoting the setting up of green hydrogen, green ammonia, and related manufacturing facilities in the state.

The incentives and offers include the lease of government land at a subsidised rate of Rs 31,000 per acre per year, with an escalation of 5 percent every two years; 100 percent exemption from land-use conversion charges and stamp duty; and any incentive available to industrial units in the state will be made available to green hydrogen and ammonia units too.

It is also offering a 100 percent SGST waiver in the sale of green hydrogen/ammonia; 100 percent waiver of electricity duty levied on RE used to produce the green energy; and reimbursement of cross-subsidy surcharge for five years for energy drawn from RE sources within the state. Cross-subsidy surcharge goes towards the supply of electricity to poor and under-privileged customers.

Maharashtra

On July 4, the Maharashtra government approved its green hydrogen policy and sanctioned Rs 8,562 crore to provide subsidies and benefits to companies producing the green energy or manufacturing electrolysers in the state.

At present, the demand for green hydrogen in the state is 500 kilo tonnes annually, and the state is aiming to create 1.5 million tonnes of production capacity.

The policy includes exemption of cross-subsidy surcharge and additional surcharge in power bills for green electricity procured for the production of green hydrogen; 50 percent exemption from intra-state transmission charges for 10 years from the commissioning of green hydrogen projects, for power procured from RE plants; and 100 percent exemption from electricity duty.

Gujarat

Gujarat plans to give green hydrogen manufacturing the status of a priority sector. The state government has already announced a land allotment policy that offers several benefits to companies investing in green hydrogen projects in the state.

Per the policy, companies must roll out 50 percent of their green hydrogen production capacity within five years of plant commissioning, and 100 percent within eight years. The land, initially provided on a 40-year lease, will be deemed non-agricultural and subject to an annual rent of Rs 15,000 per hectare, increasing by 15 percent every three years.

The Gujarat government aims to become a hub for green hydrogen by building a production capacity of 8 metric tonnes per annum (MTPA) by 2035.

Senior state government officials told Moneycontrol that the incentives are likely to include interest subsidy of 7 percent for 8-10 years with a cap of 1 percent of investment; 80-100 percent net SGST reimbursement for 10 years; and electricity duty exemption, to name a few.

Uttar Pradesh

The Uttar Pradesh (UP) government plans to have a green hydrogen production capacity of nearly 5,00,000 tonnes per annum by 2028, for which the state is drafting its Green Hydrogen Policy, 2023.

The current demand for hydrogen in UP is approximately 9,00,000 tonnes per annum, especially in the fertiliser and refinery sectors. The UP government has announced it will set up two centres of excellence dedicated to green hydrogen research under the UP New and Renewable Energy Development Agency.

Per the draft policy that was floated for public comments last year in November, the incentives proposed are exemption of stamp duty, electricity duty, tax reimbursement, capital interest subsidy, subsidised infra loans, etc. These will be applicable to new green hydrogen/ammonia projects, and green expansion of existing fertiliser units in the state.

Rajasthan

On September 16, the Ashok Gehlot-led state announced its Rajasthan Green Hydrogen Policy, 2023.

The Rajasthan government will offer a 50 percent rebate in transmission and distribution charges for 10 years for 500 KTPA (kilo-tonnes per annum) renewable energy plants to be installed on the state's transmission system.

It will also provide exemption from additional and cross-subsidy surcharges for 10 years if green hydrogen is procured from third parties; priority in land allocation for green hydrogen production; 30 percent subsidy of up to Rs 25 crore for establishing green hydrogen research centres; freedom to bank generated electricity; no capacity restrictions on captive power projects; 100 percent waiver on transmission charges; and reimbursement/waiver of energy banking charges for 7-10 years.

Madhya Pradesh

Madhya Pradesh has included green hydrogen and green ammonia related interventions in its renewable energy policy. In that it has stated that electrolyser manufacturing units with investments greater than or equal to Rs 50 crore will be eligible for special incentives earmarked for the RE equipment manufacturing sector under the industrial promotion policy.

Tamil Nadu and Odisha

While Tamil Nadu is finalising a separate green hydrogen policy, Odisha has announced exemptions on cross-subsidy, additional surcharges, and state transmission charges for 20 years. Odisha is also offering SGST waiver and reimbursement of Rs 3 per unit of green power purchased and consumed from local discoms for 20 years.

“This state-of-the-art platform will be a catalyst in accelerating AI-driven innovations across sectors, from healthcare and education to enterprise solutions. Our vision is to make AI accessible to researchers, start-ups, and enterprises across the nation, thereby accelerating India's journey towards becoming an AI powerhouse,” Akash said.

Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekharan said that advancements in AI have made it central priority in governments, industries and societies at large.

""Our partnership with NVIDIA will democratize access to AI infrastructure, accelerate build-out of AI solutions and enable upgradation of AI talent at scale. Tata Group’s presence across sectors coupled with NVIDIA’s deep capabilities offers numerous opportunities for collaboration to advance India’s AI ambition,"" he said.

Clad in his trademark black biker jacket, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang spoke to journalists in Bengaluru that the plan is to build supercomputers.

“In the case of Reliance, they're going to use it to create generative AI services for their 450 million customers. In the case of Tata, Tata Communications is going to create infrastructure,” he said.

This infrastructure that Tata Communications will be building is to support AI companies in India right now that are looking for infrastructure.

“They're all clamouring for supply, access to infrastructure. They're flying all over the world looking for infrastructure around the world, they might have to export their engineers to go work in California, so they can have infrastructure there. There's no reason to do that. Build the infrastructure here, the engineers don't have to leave,” he said.

Meeting with PM Modi

This comes in the same week that the NVIDIA chief met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, where it was previously revealed that they discussed the ‘rich potential’ of AI.

Huang said that he spoke to the Prime Minister on three aspects: acceleration of building AI infra in India, the need to upskill and primarily reskill every single engineer to be an AI engineer in the future (including NVIDIA’s own talent pool), and thirdly that NVIDIA would like to partner with companies in India — where it also reskills the IT workforce in India to make it the largest AI workforce in the world.

“I would like to accelerate the building of AI infrastructure here in India. You have your own data, lots and lots of data. You also have very diverse languages. Your diverse languages and population have diverse needs, different from the rest of the world. You have a local market, you have all of your own data. You have the great talent of computer scientists. You produce more computer scientists than any country on the planet. Your infrastructure for producing computer scientists is actual intelligence. You produce world-class computer scientists at scale,” Huang said.

Now, the idea is to create a new type of infrastructure that transforms data into intelligence, and Huang stresses there is no need for India to outsource that task.

“We should build it here. Train it here. Produce AI here. You have everything you need. Everything you need to build the AI and use the AI here in India, but you need to have infrastructure. This is now the production of intelligence,” he said.

The NVIDIA head honcho later made a prediction that one of India's largest export products is likely to be the AI it produces. “You will export more AI expertise than any country in the world. It potentially could be your largest export,” Huang said.

He stressed on artificial intelligence closing the technology divide.

“India has invested with so much vision in building the 5G infrastructure, and because everyone has access to a phone, on the other side of the phone is going to be an AI in the future. Whatever that villager would like to do, or a farmer would like to do what anybody would like to do. You just ask your phone, and your phone will perform the task for you. We have closed the technology divided. And he [PM Modi] is so happy to hear that.

Across India, NVIDIA has four development centres — Gurugram, Hyderabad, Pune and Bengaluru — and has more than 3,800 employees in the country. Of this, a little over 2,200 are based in India’s Silicon Valley. In fact, Huang said the company will be looking to double or triple its headcount here but did not offer any timeline.

Huang also backed the idea of India having AI sovereignty, because the country itself has sovereign needs. “The country itself has sovereign needs. It has data that the country needs to process and wants to process. It has national security reasons maybe. It needs to advance the infrastructure, irrespective of the profitability of companies.”

In a boost to India's artificial intelligence and semiconductor chip ambitions, global chip design major NVIDIA and local oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries on September 8 announced a partnership to develop an indigenous foundation large language model trained on the nation's diverse languages and tailored for generative AI applications.

The two companies will work together to build AI infrastructure that is over an order of magnitude more powerful than the fastest supercomputer in India today.

While NVIDIA will provide access to its most advanced chips and AI supercomputing service in the cloud, execution and implementation will be managed by Reliance Jio, which has extensive offerings and experience across mobile telephony, 5G spectrum, fibre networks and more.

The Al infrastructure will be hosted in AI-ready computing data centres that will eventually expand to 2,000 MW.

""We are delighted to partner with Reliance to build state-of-the-art AI supercomputers in India,"" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.

""India has scale, data and talent. With the most advanced AI computing infrastructure, Reliance can build its own large language models that power generative AI applications made in India, for the people of India,"" he added.

Jio's collaboration with NVIDIA also aligns with the local conglomerate's strategy of serving as a large, comprehensive digital, cloud and networking platform for both consumers and business customers.

""As India advances from a country of data proliferation to creating technology infrastructure for widespread and accelerated growth, computing and technology super centres like the one we envisage with NVIDIA will provide the catalytic growth just like Jio did to our nation's digital march,"" said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries. ""I am delighted with the partnership with NVIDIA and looking forward to a purposeful journey together.

""At Jio, we are committed to fueling India's technology renaissance by democratizing access to cutting-edge technologies, and our collaboration with NVIDIA is a significant step in this direction,"" said Akash Ambani, chairman of Reliance Jio Infocomm. ""Together, we will develop a state-of-the-art AI cloud infrastructure that is secure, sustainable and deeply relevant across India, accelerating the nation's journey towards becoming an AI powerhouse.""

Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail Ventures is in advanced talks with global investors to raise around $2.5 billion by the end of September, ahead of a potential stock market listing, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Three sources said the target fund raise of $2.5 billion is part of a combined $3.5 billion target the firm has set for itself, a part of which – $1 billion – came from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and was announced last month.

In an emailed statement, Reliance said ”As a policy, we do not comment on media speculation and rumours.”, but added ”Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis.”

Reliance last month said it raised $1 billion from QIA at a $100 billion valuation for India’s biggest retailer whose operations stretch from selling groceries to electronics, and include foreign partnerships with brands like Burberry and Pret A Manger.

Morgan Stanley is advising Reliance on the process, said two sources with direct knowledge. Morgan Stanley did not respond to a request for comment.

All the three sources declined to name potential investors. But the first source said Reliance was talking to at least two U.S.-based investors, while the other two sources said there was growing interest from existing foreign investors of Reliance, including some sovereign wealth funds.

The investment, if it materializes, will bolster India’s status as a rare bright spot for Western private investors who are shying away from new investments in China due to the country’s worsening economic outlook and geopolitical tensions.

In 2020, Reliance Retail raised $5.71 billion by selling a 10.09% stake to investors including KKR, the Saudi Public Investment Fund, General Atlantic and the United Arab Emirates’ Mubadala.

Ambani said this week its 2020 fund raise valued the business at around $52 billion, and ”in less than three years, the valuation of retail has almost doubled.”

A fourth source with direct knowledge said two Reliance fund raise announcements were likely within two weeks, and valuation of the company would be around the same at which QIA invested -around $100 billion. That implies a potential $2.5 billion investment will be equivalent to a 2.5% stake in the company.

”Several marquee global strategic and financial investors have shown strong interest in Reliance Retail. I will update you about our progress with them in due course,” Ambani said on Monday during the company’s annual general meeting, without sharing further details.

Ambani said in 2019 that the group planned to list the retail business in five years.

Ambani’s daughter Isha Ambani leads the retail expansion. Reliance Retail has more than 18,000 retail outlets, but also a growing e-commerce operation where it competes with the likes of Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart.

Reliance Retail reported a consolidated net profit of 91.81 billion Indian rupees ($1.11 billion) for the financial year that ended in March 2023, on revenue of 2.6 trillion rupees.

Since last year, Reliance Retail has been expanding its consumer business by acquiring dozens of small grocery and non-food brands as it targets building a consumer business generating annual sales of $6 billion within five years to challenge foreign giants like Unilever.",536,0.8811115175485611

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has become India’s largest bio-energy producer based on the company’s indigenously developed technology, Chairman Mukesh Ambani recently said at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM).

In this explainer, Moneycontrol looks at the work done by Reliance in the bio-energy segment and the bigger picture.

To start with, bio-energy is a form of energy which is generated from organic materials known as biomass.

What is the big picture?

RIL said the objective is to solve the issue of stubble burning which causes severe air pollution during winters.

“Your company prides itself in embracing societal challenges and delivering world-class solutions suited for India. In the same spirit, we took to solving the problem of severe pollution faced by many of our Indian cities during winters, caused by stubble burning, and accelerated our plans to deploy bio-energy projects,” said Ambani.

In North India, stubble burning is a major cause of air pollution. During the onset of winter, farmers set agricultural waste on fire to get rid of it and prepare the fields for sowing again. This causes pollution levels to rise and the air quality index to reach severe levels.

What has Reliance done so far?

Reliance has commissioned its first commercial-scale compressed bio-gas (CBG) plant at Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh in 10 months, Ambani had informed the AGM.

It had earlier set up two demo units for CBG at Jamnagar.

Reliance now plans to rapidly scale this up to 25 CBG plants across India.

What does Reliance plan to do?

Ambani said RIL targets to establish 100 compressed bio-gas (CBG) plants in the next five years, consuming 5.5 million tonnes of agro-residue and organic waste.

The company said the move would help in mitigating nearly 2 million tonnes of carbon emissions, and producing 2.5 million tonnes of organic manure annually. Reliance expects that this would also result in a reduction of about 0.7 MMTPA (million metric tonnes per annum) of imported LNG.

What is RIL's net zero plan and how does it aim to reach there?

Reliance is targeting net carbon zero by 2035. The company has said that its oil-to-chemicals business (O2C) will transition to a sustainable, green, circular and consumer-integrated, chemicals and materials business.

Ambani said the first stage of this strategy is to switch to 100 percent green energy for captive consumption to ‘net zero’, which will reduce the energy costs and make these assets cost-competitive. The second stage is to upgrade the refinery products into downstream value-added chemicals, for which RIL has developed in-house technology.

The key pillars of the O2C transition would be accelerating the company’s journey to achieve net carbon zero by 2035 through the use of renewables and bio-energy for a sustainable and green business and accelerating circularity and consumer integration, he added.

“We are well on our way to building the new energy ecosystem of manufacturing solar, wind, batteries, hydrogen and bio-energy platforms. This will enable us to speed up the development of our renewable generation assets to deliver round-the-clock electricity for our captive requirements as well as to meet the growing needs of Indian consumers,” he added.

Ambani said the company has also been working on scaling up its chemical recycling technology to deliver application-specific green products, which is helping Reliance access high-value, high-potential customers in new value chains.

The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Friday set aside a Sebi order that imposed a Rs 25 crore penalty on industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Anil Ambani and other entities for non-compliance with takeover norms in the Reliance Industries case. The order came after Ambanis appealed in the appellate tribunal against the capital markets regulator’s directive.

""We find that the appellant has not violated … the SAST (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations. The imposition of penalty upon the appellant is without any authority of law. Consequently, the impugned order cannot be sustained and is quashed,” the appellate tribunal said in its 124-page order. The case pertains to alleged failure to comply with takeover rules.

Noting that the penalty amount following Sebi’s order was deposited by the appellants, SAT directed the markets regulator to refund the amount of Rs 25 crore within four weeks. In April 2021, Sebi levied a fine totalling Rs 25 crore on Mukesh Ambani, Anil Ambani, Nita Ambani, Tina Ambani and other entities for non-compliance with takeover norms in a Reliance Industries case dating back to 2000.

Nita is the wife of Mukesh Ambani and Tina is the wife of Anil Ambani. In its order, Sebi had stated that RIL’s promoters and Persons Acting in Concert (PAC) failed to disclose the acquisition of more than a 5 per cent stake in the company way back in 2000.

In 2005, Mukesh and Anil split the business empire built by their father Dhirubhai Ambani. Sebi noted that a 6.83 per cent stake was acquired by RIL promoters together with PACs consequent to the exercise of an option on warrants attached with non-convertible secured redeemable debentures was in excess of the ceiling of 5 per cent prescribed under the takeover regulations.

Thus, the obligation to make a public announcement about acquiring the shares arose on January 7, 2000. This was the date on which the PACs were allotted RIL equity shares on the exercise of warrants issued in January 1994, the order had mentioned.

However, Sebi found that the promoters and PACs did not make any public announcement about acquiring the shares. Since the promoters and PACs did not make any public announcement about acquiring shares, it was alleged that they violated the provisions of the takeover regulations.

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) on July 24 announced its partnership with Brookfield Infrastructure and Digital Realty to collectively invest in special purpose vehicles (SPVs) for the development of data centres in India. As per the joint statement, Reliance will hold a 33.33 percent stake in each of the SPVs, making it an equal partner in the venture.

As per the statement, Digital Realty Trust holds the position as the leading global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data centres, colocation, and interconnection solutions. With a vast network of over 300 data centres spanning 27 countries, the company has partnered with Brookfield Infrastructure to establish a joint venture. This collaboration aims to develop top-tier, well-connected, and flexible data centres in India, catering to the essential infrastructure requirements of enterprises and digital services firms.

RIL will become an equal partner in the JV, and the venture will be branded as ‘Digital Connexion: A Brookfield, Jio and Digital Realty Company’, the joint statement further stated.

The joint venture between Digital Realty Trust and Brookfield Infrastructure, according to the statement, is currently building data centres in Chennai and Mumbai. The first project MAA10 is a 100 MW campus-based 20 MW greenfield data centre in Chennai that is scheduled to be finished by the end of 2023. In addition, the JV recently bought 2.15 acres of property in Mumbai to build a 40 MW data centre.

These two strategic locations will enable the data centres to have seamless connectivity with crucial terrestrial infrastructure and undersea cables, transforming them into significant hubs for global connectivity for Indian businesses and providing gateways into India for multinational companies, the statement added.

The statement noted that India's data centre capacity is set to experience a substantial increase in the coming years as the country is already among the world's largest consumers of mobile data. This trend is anticipated to significantly increase as OTT platforms and gaming become more widely available along with the ongoing 5G rollout.

Enterprises will also incorporate data-intensive technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) when they implement 5G use cases, the statement added.

The statement further said continuous developments in generative AI technologies rely on hardware and data centre infrastructure, and so an increase in demand for these resources is predicted. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on preserving personal data within the country, which adds to the demand for additional data centre capacity in India.

The joint venture will meet the cloud and colocation demands of both local and global organisations, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the startups. The JV will effectively meet their needs as these entities increasingly move their resources to the cloud and off-premise.

Quick-commerce player Dunzo has been served a legal notice by Facebook India Online Services Private Limited (""FBI"") and Nilenso, a software consultancy firm, based out of Bengaluru, over non-payment of dues, Moneycontrol has learnt.

These developments come at a time when Google, Dunzo’s second-largest backer, has also issued a legal notice to Dunzo asking the startup to clear unpaid dues.

Dunzo has made part payments to Facebook but still owes about Rs 1.5 crore to the tech giant, people in the know told Moneycontrol. Dunzo had availed Facebook’s advertising services but did not pay the entire amount for the same.

“...Dunzo defaulted in making its payments to FBI under the Contract, despite repeated efforts, verbally and in writing, to rectify the delinquency, Dunzo acknowledged its liabilities and started making the payment to FBI. However, the payment was insufficient to settle all the outstanding balances under the account,” the legal notice read.

In total, the demand notices would not amount to more than Rs 5-6 crore for the startup, a person aware of the developments said.



Moneycontrol has reviewed a copy of the notice.

“...FBI appropriated another attempt by sending a follow up email and make a few calls on the lookout for payment status or payment plan (""Plan”) for entire outstanding. However, Dunzo failed to provide the plan, thus, the account remains suspended,” the notice dated March 17, 2023 said while adding that Dunzo had agreed to pay FBI's dues within 30 days from the date of invoices raised by FBI.

Facebook and Dunzo did not immediately reply to Moneycontrol’s queries. The story will be updated if they respond.

While Dunzo was still dealing with Facebook, people aware of the developments at the startup told Moneycontrol that Nilenso, which provides software engineers on contract, has also sent a demand notice under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to Dunzo for the payment of outstanding dues.

The Bengaluru-based cooperative is still owed around Rs 2.5 crore, after paying roughly Rs 1 crore from its total outstanding, one of the persons cited above said.

Nilenso did not immediately reply to Moneycontrol’s emails but a person aware to the developments confirmed that there is a pending litigation between Nilenso and Dunzo.

As it looks to clear its dues and better its financial health, Dunzo, which is faced with a severe cash crunch, will also be laying off employees, Moneycontrol had reported on July 19.

This will be the company’s third round of layoffs within the last seven months, with the company having its back to the wall as it faces mounting troubles, thanks to issues surrounding cashflow.

Senior employees estimated that at least 20 percent of the company’s workforce — approximately 200 employees — will be affected. So far, 380 employees have already been let go by the company in two rounds of layoffs.

In June, Dunzo deferred salaries for around 50 percent of its workforce — roughly 500 employees — with the promise that dues would be cleared by July 20. That deadline was however missed. Due to the cash crunch, the company had also capped the salaries of employees at Rs 75,000 in June, no matter how much higher than this their salary is. Everyone below the threshold was to get paid in full.

""We understand this is very difficult for you and we appreciate your patience. At this stage, we need to focus on streamlining our cash flow so we can build a more sustainable business for the future. We need your support as we work through this,"" the email sent to employees read.

Dunzo had raised $75 million in April, but continues to struggle — a clear indicator of its high burn rate.

The company has continued to juggle measures to stay afloat. It has looked at sourcing products through a marketplace model after it reportedly shut over 50 percent of its dark stores, along with exiting unprofitable markets. Additionally, it has increased its delivery fees, started delaying deliveries and is also levying convenience fees on users to earn more on each order.

Founded in 2015, Dunzo has so far raised close to $500 million since 2015 from Reliance, Google, Lightrock, Lightbox, Blume Ventures and several others. Reliance is the largest shareholder with a 25.8 percent stake in the company, and Google was the second-largest with around 19 percent ownership in Dunzo, according to Tracxn.

Jio Financial Services (JFS), the demerged financial services unit of Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries, was valued at around $20 billion after its stock price was set at a much higher-than-expected 261.85 rupees on Thursday.

The demerger by billionaire Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance is considered the oil-to-retail conglomerate’s way of expanding in the lucrative financial services sector, especially as it has a non-bank financial company licence.

In a first, India’s main stock exchanges held a special hour-long ”pre-open call auction” trading session for Reliance on Thursday to determine JFS’ share price.

The price was determined as 261.85 rupees, or the difference between 2,841.85 rupees, Reliance’s closing price on Wednesday, and 2,580 rupees, its price at the end of the special session.

JFS’s stock price is higher than analysts’ estimate of 160 rupees to 190 rupees. Stockholders will get one JFS share for each Reliance share they hold.

The stock will be included in major Indian indices, including the benchmark Nifty 50, but will not trade until it is listed, the date for which Reliance will likely set at its upcoming annual general meeting.

Reliance announced the demerger of Reliance Strategic Investments, which will be renamed JFS, last October.

JFS’ access to vast amounts of data from Reliance’s telecom and retail businesses will also help it kick-start lending, analysts have said. Macquarie Research said JFS would likely be an AAA-rated entity that could borrow at attractive rates.

Late on Wednesday, Reliance Strategic Investments reported a standalone net profit after tax of 1.45 billion rupees ($17.7 million) for April-June, and a total income of 2.15 billion rupees.

Reliance had surged about 8% from July 8, when it set the record date for the demerger, through Wednesday.

The stock was trading about 1.4% higher at 10.16 a.m. IST after the special session. It is up 11.6% so far this year, outpacing a 9.5% rise in the Nifty 50.

The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impulsive to the patient, from the overreacting to the disciplined. - Jason Zweig

Cricket lovers will remember an extended period in the Nineties when the entire burden of India’s batting was borne by Sachin Tendulkar alone. Something similar transpired in yesterday’s anaemic session, with Reliance Industries single-handedly keeping the frontline benchmarks afloat even as the broader market struggled for direction.

The triggers were two-fold. First, it fixed July 20 as the record date for allotting shares of Reliance Strategic Investments to RIL shareholders in a 1:1 ratio. RSIL will be renamed Jio Financial Services (JFSL), marking the oil-to-telecom conglomerate’s foray into the scorching-hot financial services space. Second, Reliance Retail will buy back its unlisted shares from non-promoters at Rs 1,362 apiece. The promoter and holding company Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL) holds 99.91 percent of the share capital.

There was a flurry of activity in the derivative segment as well, with a spike in demand for puts. Massive put writing was seen in strikes of 2,680, 2,700,

2,720, and 2,740. Among single-stock options, RIL topped the list of maximum open interest in terms of contracts outstanding. Why the sudden interest in puts? One explanation is that the stock is at a crucial juncture. Twice last year, it ran into resistance at the Rs 2,800 mark, and the market is keenly watching if the index heavyweight will be able to break past the resistance this time around.

Brokerages too are gung-ho about the corporate giant's network linkages – Reliance Retail’s footprint, Jio Telecom’s subscriber base and now the financial unit’s expected big-bang debut. Jio Financial Services has been one of the most keenly-tracked names in recent times, with excitable analysts and investors brandishing epithets like ‘the next big thing’, ‘BajajFinance-killer’ and so on.

The capex debate… continued

Yesterday, Short Call mentioned the contrasting trends in capex for the central government (rising) and state government (falling). The popular view in the market is capital goods and engineering stocks are among the safe bets in the current market, as macro-environment appears to be similar to the one seen during 2003-08. Capex is one of the compelling stories at the moment, but investors should be wary of any comparison with the 2003-08 period, cautions Kotak Institutional Equities. That is because global growth and trade cycle are much weaker this time, and will be a major headwind. And, while the central government has been doing the heavy lifting so far, there is only so much it can do.

From the Kotak Note:

“Private capex cycle would require visibility of long-term high demand growth (including global growth), which is still missing. For now, even as the long-term growth fundamentals remain strong, we remain cautious in calling out for a broad-based sustained capex cycle.”

Tale of Two Cities

The Q1 results season is upon us, and analysts are looking forward to another standout show by banks, though there are some murmurs of concern regarding agri delinquencies (which see a spurt in the June quarter).

That said, opinion is near unanimous that proactive NPA recognition, robust loan demand, reasonable buffers and strong capital position have placed banks in a structurally sound space.

In contrast, the mood on the other side of the planet is as gloomy as a Monday morning team meeting.

The largest US banks are this week set to report the biggest jump in loan losses since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, as rising interest rates pile up pressure on borrowers across the economy, reports FT. Six largest US banks — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — are predicted to have written off a collective $5 billion tied to defaulted loans in the June quarter, according to the average estimates of bank analysts compiled by Bloomberg.

With three years of relatively low defaults, in part fuelled by pandemic-era stimulus and other government assistance, the banks are set to face the full force of record interest rates, souring consumer sentiment and stubborn inflation.

Too much of a good thing

After sitting on the sidelines at the start of this year, asset managers, hedge funds and individual investors have picked up buying activity, joining quant funds, reports Wall Street Journal.

This frenzy of buying has pushed their US stock market positioning to its highest level in nearly 18 months, according to an estimate from JPMorgan Chase, and making some parts of the tech sector, namely software and semiconductor companies, look particularly stretched. This crowded positioning has stirred worries that US stocks could be vulnerable to a rapid reversal later this year.

Icahn chastened

Famed corporate raider Carl Icahn has raised a white flag to the bears by amending loan agreements with his banks that delink his personal loans from the trading price of his company’s shares, increase his collateral and set up a plan to fully repay the loans in three years. The first point, of personal loans being linked to the trading price of the shares, was one of the major concerns raised by Hindenburg Research in its report, which sent shares of his holding firm Icahn Corp tumbling 40 percent. And while Hindenburg Research may have succeeded in forcing a change of approach at Ichan, its report is yet to have the same effect on the Adani group.

Reverse swing

Splitting the face value of a stock to increase liquidity and make it accessible to retail investors is quite common. Not so common is companies going in for a reverse stock split, i.e increasing the face value to boost the share price. That is what Nasdaq-listed spacecraft engine manufacturer and small rocket builder Astra plans to do. In stock exchange filing, the company said it plans to conduct a reverse stock split at a 1 to 15 ratio. This means an investor with 15 shares of Astra quoting at $0.4 will now own 1 share of $6 if the proposal is approved.

Like the regular stock split, a reverse stock split too does not affect the fundamentals of a company, but it would lift the stock price by combining shares.

From CNBC.com

“A reverse split can be seen as a sign a company is in distress and is trying to “artificially” boost its stock price, or it can be viewed as a way for a viable company with a beaten up stock to continue operations on a public exchange.""

After a string of layoffs this year, Google-backed Dunzo, the quick-commerce player, has now deferred the salaries of 50 percent of its employees for the month of June, Moneycontrol has learnt. The company’s top management will be the most affected by the move, people aware of the developments added.

The decision was primarily because the company was facing issues managing its cashflows, despite raising $75 million in April this year, underscoring the company’s high cash burn rate. In the same month, Dunzo also fired around 300 employees in its second cost-cutting move, after it had let go of around 80 staffers in January 2023.

Dunzo has over 1,000 employees in total and the latest decision to defer salaries will impact about 500 of them, the people cited above told Moneycontrol. The decision also indicates that there could be more layoffs in the pipeline, they added. The startup has, however, assured staffers that it would be paying them salaries later this month.

The company declined to comment on Moneycontrol’s queries.

Cost cuts at the Bengaluru-based company are not new. Over the past few months, Dunzo is also increasing focus on sourcing products through a marketplace model, instead of fully relying on its network of dark stores. The company now buys products from the nearest supermarket and delivers them to customers, rather than storing items in-house contrary to what Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit and Zepto do.

That move has reportedly led to Dunzo reducing its dark store count by around 50 percent. The company also began charging higher delivery fees, delaying deliveries and also levying convenience fees on users as it looks to earn more money per order and put itself on a path to profitability.

Dunzo has so far raised close to $500 million since 2015 from Reliance, Google, Lightrock, Lightbox, Blume Ventures and several others. Reliance is the largest shareholder with a 25.6 percent stake in the company, and Google was the second-largest with around 19 percent ownership in Dunzo, according to Tracxn.

Reliance Jio, the telecom arm of oil-to-retail conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd, on July 3 announced the launch of the internet-enabled 'JioBharat' phones, at a starting price of Rs 999.

Chairman, CII Branding and Marketing Committee and Managing Partner Counselage India, Suhel Seth said that over the years, in everything Reliance has done, there has been a commitment to every Indian irrespective of caste, colour, creed or income.

""The JioBharat phone is about digital democracy and empowerment at its best. It's about making everything everyone able to do what they want through their phones. In many ways, just like when Mukesh Ambani launched Jio in 2016, this launch is a similar day in the history of Indian telecom and the digitisation history of India."" he added.

According to Seth, Reliance has created uniform access across platforms. ""They are platform-agnostic and wholly consumer-centric,"" he said. ""... they are empowering every Indian to make the choices they couldn't make either because of limitations of money or access. In one swoop, both have been marginalised. Today you have affordable access of the highest kind.""

The phone has been launched with the ""2G-mukt Bharat vision"", and is aimed at providing the ""existing 250 million feature phone users"" in the country with internet-enabled phones, Jio said.

In many ways, the ""2G-mukt Bharat"" dream of Mukesh Ambani has arrived as this phone aims to hasten the demise of the 2G phone era.

""When Jio was launched in 2016, the market had to do price correction and behaviour correction. The arrogance of the erstwhile telecom operators disappeared overnight because they were faced with a challenge both in terms of price and performance by Jio. Today is another such day when price and performance will be far superior to what's available right now,"" Seth adds.

This is the ""lowest entry price for an internet-enabled phone"", Jio said in a release, adding that those buying the handset will be eligible for ""30 percent cheaper monthly plan and 7 times more data compared to feature phone offerings of other operators"".

Jio's launch tailwinds the PM's vision of a digital India.

""... in many ways, they are creating an egalitarian world in India with affordable prices,"" Seth says.

This launch sets the benchmark for more products and services for the other sectors of society where affordability is a factor, said Seth, adding in every category that Reliance operates, it will follow the same principles.

""Expect more of this in Jio, in FMCG, and others. Reliance is India's original disruptor... it's a disruption with added value. They not only disrupt the market, they create it."" Seth said.

Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and energy major bp on June 30 announced the commencement of production from the MJ field of KG D6 block in India’s east coast.

MJ field is the last major deepwater development that the RIL-bp consortium was working on in the KG D6 block. The field will produce from eight wells and reach a peak gas production of around 12 MMSCMD (million metric standard cubic meters per day) gas and 25,000 barrels of condensate per day, according to a press release.

Other than the MJ field, gas & condensate production in the KG D6 block had started from the R-Cluster field in December 2020 and Satellite Cluster in April 2021.

The companies said that the three fields collectively are expected to produce around 30 million standard cubic metres of gas a day (or 1 billion cubic feet a day) when MJ field reaches peak production.

The collective production is expected to account for around one third of India’s current domestic gas production and meet approximately 15 percent of India’s demand, the companies added.

This comes as India, which imports around 50 percent of its natural gas requirements, is pushing to increase the share of gas in its energy basket from current 6.2 percent to 15 percent by 2030.

The Indian government is focusing on increasing domestic oil and gas production to reduce the country’s reliance on imports for energy requirements.

bp Chief Executive Bernard Looney said, “By safely bringing these new developments onstream, RIL and bp are making an important contribution to meeting India’s demand for secure supplies of gas.”

The MJ field, which was discovered in 2013 and sanctioned in 2019, is located in water depths of up to 1,200 metres about 30 kilometres from the existing onshore terminal at Gadimoga on the east coast of India. MJ is a high Pressure and high Temperature (HPHT), gas & condensate field.

The development includes a new Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel – the ‘Ruby’ – to process and separate the condensate, gas, water, and impurities, before sending the gas onshore for sale. Condensate is stored on the FPSO before being offloaded to shuttle tankers for supply to Indian refineries.

RIL is the operator of the KG D6 block, with a 66.67 percent participating interest while bp holds 33.33 percent.

It is a list of the 500 most valuable non-state-owned companies in India, ranked according to their value, defined as market capitalization for listed companies, and valuations for non-listed companies.

""The total value of the top 500 companies in India declined marginally by 6.4 per cent to Rs 212 lakh crore from Rs 227 lakh crore as of October 30, 2022,"" it said adding the companies on the list underperformed compared to SENSEX and other global indices.

government garnered in 2021-22. The amount could rise further since because a few such as Gail (India), Hindustan Copper, and Balmer Lawrie are yet to declare dividend.

Why it’s important: The record dividend from listed state-owned will provide the government additional dry powder to upscale public expenditure in an election year without widening the fiscal deficit.

#2. Key local market gauge indicates interest rates may stay high for longer

The rates for overnight indexed swaps, a key indicator of how the Reserve Bank of India may act on policy rates, have climbed over the past eight days, reversing earlier optimism that rates were likely to head lower in the last quarter of 2023. The reset in domestic interest rate expectations have been

driven are policy statements by the Indian central bank and the US Federal Reserve on June 8 and 14, in which both flagged concerns over persistent inflation.

Why it’s important: The important market gauge is now penciling in a reduction in the cost of borrowing funds only in April next year. Inflation is simply not cooling fast enough to warrant an immediate easing of monetary policy in the near term.

#3. Exports decline for fourth straight month; trade deficit widens to five-month high

India’s merchandise exports in May contracted for a fourth straight month as external demand remained slack on a slowdown in its key markets, commerce ministry data showed. Outbound shipments declined 10.31 percent on year to $34.98 billion, and imports fell 6.59 per cent to $57.10 billion. External trade contracted for a fifth consecutive month amid cooling commodity prices and India’s policy to substitute inbound shipments. It led to the trade deficit widening to a five-month high

of $22.12 billion in May.

Why it’s important: The headwind to India’s external trade is expected to continue due to an economic slowdown in the key markets in the West and elsewhere.

#4. Singapore Airlines may gradually raise its stake in Air India to 40 percent

Singapore Airlines may gradually raise its stake in Air India from the current 25.1 percent to about 40percent. The carrier and the Tata group have held initial talks regarding the potential increase in stake in response to a request from the Singapore-based airline. The proposal is still at an early

stage.

Why it’s important: Air India would welcome such a move as it seeks to take on domestic market leader IndiGo and compete with other global carriers popular with Indians for overseas travel.

#5. iPhone maker Foxconn may build an electric vehicle factory in Indian in 2023

Foxconn is looking to enter the electric vehicle manufacturing sector in India. The Taiwanese contract manufacturer has been in talks with some state governments to further its plans. Foxconn has said in its annual report that India will assist with the establishment of a production line this year to provide two-wheeled electric vehicle manufacturing services that will cater to the market in Southeast Asia.

Why it’s important: It is the first time Foxconn has articulated its ambitions of manufacturing electric two-wheelers in India on the back of a rapidly growing market in the country and southeast Asia.

#6. Transamerica cancels $2 billion contract with TCS to focus on insourcing IT services

Tata Consultancy Services’ $2 billion, 10-year deal with US arm of Dutch insurer Aegon has been scrapped five-and-a-half years after Transamerica Life Insurance company selected India’s largest IT services company. Transamerica plans to cut its dependence on third-party IT services firms such as TCS, choosing to do much of the IT work on its own.

Why it’s important: Losing a marquee client would be seen as a setback although the financial impact will be minimal as TCS will have concluded about eight years of the contract period before its ends prematurely.

#7. Reliance Industries to raise $2 billion in dollar loans to fund business expansion

Reliance Industries is in talks with lenders for a foreign currency loan of up to $2 billion to fund the ongoing expansion of its oil to telecom business. The firm controlled by Mukesh Ambani intends to use India’s dedicated external commercial borrowing route to secure the loan. The facility may have a maturity period ranging between three to five years and the proceeds will be used for capital expenditure and to refinance a loan that matures in September.

Why it’s important: Reliance’s recent activity towards expansion of its various businesses has been driven by huge borrowings after the conglomerate achieved net debt zero status in 2020. It is in a

strong position to secure loans at favorable terms.

#8. Two-wheeler demand in rural market sees resurgence after a few years

Demand for motorcycles and scooters has remained weak in the Past few years amid a rise in acquisition costs and the economic impact of the pandemic. It has now started picking up, propelled by a turnaround in consumer sentiment in rural markets, industry executives said. The sector expect sales to grow in double digits in the current financial year, largely driven by pent-up demand in rural areas that account for about 55 percent of two-wheeler sales in the country.

Why it’s important: Better farm output, an increase in the minimum support price for the autumn harvest announced last week and state spending on rural development are expected will help increase disposable incomes in rural areas, leading to a spurt in demand.

#9. Willful defaulters in India to get loans only after five years of settlement

India’s banks will be allowed to provide loans to willful borrowers and defaulters after five years of a compromise settlement. Debt restructuring will be allowed only if there is a change in promoters. The Reserve Bank of India had issued circular on compromise settlement with borrowers, including willful defaulters and accounts.

Why it’s important: The move by the central bank will make defaulting on loans ore expensive in terms of opportunity cost for borrowing firms, compelling them to work harder to service loans regularly.

#10. Market leader IndiGo improves share after Go First halted operations

IndiGo has registered its highest ever domestic market share of 61.4 percent in May, capitalising on Go First suspending flights. Domestic airlines flew a record 13.2 million passengers in May, improving on the December 2019 figure of 13.01 million. IndiGo flew more than 8.1 million passengers and registered a 61.4 per cent share, official data showed.

Why it’s important: Despite persistent complaints of poor service quality, IndiGo’s on time performance and multiple flight options has made it a passenger favorite for domestic air travel.",1152,0.07547598726609174

The re-entry of Shein into the Indian e-commerce market, through its partnership with Reliance, could help revitalise the e-commerce sector that has slowed down over the past year as it's dealing with macro headwinds like the funding winter and drop in demand, according to Delhivery co-founder and chief executive officer Sahil Barua.

“They obviously were a fairly high-volume player the last time they were here. I think they will significantly improve the sourcing capabilities for Reliance. In fact, I think Ajio has been one of the fastest-growing ecommerce platforms in the last 12 months. And I think this certainly bodes well for the market,” Barua said in a post-earnings call.

“I think category spending by any single large player is like a high tide which lifts all boats. And so when Shein comes in, category spending hopefully comes in. Because of that, I think other e-commerce companies also stand to benefit,” he added.

Almost three years after getting banned in India, Chinese online fast fashion brand Shein is re-entering here in partnership with the country’s leading retailer Reliance Retail, according to news reports. It was one of the apps that were banned by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in June 2020 after tension with China escalated on the Himalayan borders.

Meanwhile, the e-commerce sector in India has slowed down after fast growth during the pandemic years.

According to consulting firm Redseer, e-tailing gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew by about 44 percent from $25 billion in FY20 to $36 billion in FY21. And then the GMV further increased by around 36 percent year-on-year (YoY) to $49 billion in FY22. However, the pace of YoY growth slowed sharply to 22 percent in FY23 when the GMV increased to $60 billion.

""I don't want to become the Cassandra of this industry. But I must say when I said that three quarters ago, it was generally met with widespread disbelief… My own estimation hasn't changed. I expect e-commerce to continue to grow between 15% and 20% year on year,"" said Barua.

The sector's slowdown is attributed to inflation pangs hitting consumer demand, funding crunch for private e-commerce players who relied on discounts, and returns and refund policies favourable to customers.

“I think individual players will continue to see headwinds through the year because they have to fundamentally re-architect some portions of their business. And I think ultimately, that will cause a drag on the sector to some extent, but I think if you look at the news from on Shein, for instance, I think that is going to drive growth in the market next year,” Barua said.

The Delhivery chief also added that the increased focus on profitability in the e-commerce sector is a good thing for the company as it is able to gain market share by offering its logistics services at more affordable costs. However, he denied that there was pricing pressure on the industry.

After Delhivery posted a 10 percent year-on-year decline in revenue, Barua pointed out that the drop was on account of Chinese e-commerce company Shopee’s exit from India last year. He argued that — adjusted for the revenue that Shopee had brought — Delhivey had actually grown 17 percent year-on-year in the March quarter.

Barua said that Delhivery was ready to get back on the lane of fast growth as its integration with Spoton, which it acquired last year, is now complete.

“At the start of the year when we did the Spoton integration and there were multiple questions around growth. I had mentioned at the time that the company's primary focus was not getting the growth strap on, but really was making sure that the margins were intact,” he said.

“Because there's no point driving fast if you don't know where you're going. In our case, we have four sequential quarter quarters of margin improvement, I think it's quite clear as to how the margin improvement will continue. And now turning on the growth tap for us is not going to be very hard,” he added.

The Delhivery chief also said that the logistics company was already seeing some volumes from Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), but the network had yet to sort out issues on fronts like returns and refunds.

Delhivery's net loss widened to Rs 159 crore in the fourth quarter ended March 2023, as the logistics company's revenue dropped for the second straight quarter amid a slowdown in e-commerce.

Delhivery reported an operating income of Rs 1,859.6 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, 10 percent lower than Rs 2,017 crore in the same period last year, the company's filings with the BSE showed. The logistics company had a net loss of Rs 119.8 crore in the fourth quarter of FY22 (2021-22).

The company's revenue has now declined for two consecutive quarters. In the December quarter, the logistics company's revenue had dropped 8.5 percent from a year earlier.

Six of the 10 most valued firms faced a combined erosion of Rs 70,486.95 crore in their market valuation last week, with Reliance Industries and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) taking the biggest hit following a weak trend in equities.

While Reliance Industries, TCS, HDFC Bank, ITC, State Bank of India and HDFC were the laggards from the top 10 pack, ICICI Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys and Bharti Airtel were the gainers.

Last week, the BSE Sensex declined 298.22 points or 0.48 per cent.

""Markets took a breather last week and shed half a per cent amid mixed cues. The beginning was upbeat, however, profit-taking in heavyweights across sectors pushed the index lower in the following sessions,"" Ajit Mishra, VP - Technical Research at Religare Broking Ltd, said.

Among major losers, the market valuation of Reliance Industries fell by Rs 27,941.49 crore to Rs 16,52,702.63 crore and that of TCS eroded by Rs 19,027.06 crore to Rs 11,78,854.88 crore.

Investors in US exchange-traded funds are once again starting to favor emerging-market stocks — as long as they don’t include China.

The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, which invests in stocks across the developing world, but not those in the world’s second-biggest economy, received inflows of $148 million last week. That was its fifth successive week of net deposits and the biggest in five months for the fund whose largest holdings include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Reliance Industries Ltd. and Vale SA.

Meanwhile, ETFs that exclusively buy Chinese shares continued to fail to get new inflows last week. China’s patchy economic recovery as well as rising geopolitical tensions and regulatory risks have tempered investor enthusiasm for Chinese equities, even as cheaper valuations and improved growth prospects are luring some investors back to emerging markets. The MSCI China Index has trailed its counterpart for the rest of emerging markets since late January, with the ratio between the two gauges at its lowest level since early December.

“The challenges overshadowing the Chinese economy are immense and have serious implications for international capital flows as well as the domestic allocation of capital, where we see a growing risk of Japan-style economic stagnation,” Ashish Chugh, a money manager at Loomis Sayles & Co. in Boston, said in an email interview Friday. “The excessive property sector and local-government debt are a major overhang on long-term growth and solvency.”

The ex-China fund has rallied in six of the past seven weeks and has not witnessed a week of outflows since Oct. 7. Investors have poured $639 million into the $3.8 billion fund, buying it even during the emerging-market selloffs in February and April. The all-equity fund has allocated 21% of its resources to Taiwan, 20% to India, 17% to South Korea and 7.4% to Brazil.

In contrast, the iShares MSCI China ETF has gone without a single day of inflows since Jan. 30, as the optimism from the start of the year around the country’s economic reopening from Covid curbs evaporates.

Other funds, such as the Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF and the iShares China Large-Cap ETF, have also gone without fresh deposits over several weeks.

Broader data on ETF flows backed the idea that emerging-market investors are avoiding China. According to Bloomberg’s calculations, developing-nation stock funds received new deposits of $223 million in the week through May 5, with the biggest flows going to Mexico, Taiwan, India and South Korea. China witnessed outflows across stocks and bonds.

First Solar is setting up India's first fully integrated cadmium telluride based solar module manufacturing unit.

US-based solar cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film module manufacturer, First Solar, is among the three companies chosen for the Indian government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for developing fully integrated solar module manufacturing plants in the country.

In the Polysilicon-ingots-wafers-cells-modules (PWCM) basket of the PLI, First Solar has been allocated a PLI of Rs 1177.573 crore, Reliance New Solar Energy Ltd has won Rs 3,098.04 crore and Indosol Solar Pvt Ltd has been offered Rs 3,300 crore.

In an exclusive interaction with Moneycontrol, the company’s country managing director, Sujoy Ghosh, talks about the initial production targets for its manufacturing unit and the challenges being faced in the supply-chain ecosystem.

First Solar is building a 3.4 gigawatt (GW) solar panel manufacturing unit in Tamil Nadu, the trial runs of which will begin from June 2023. “As we speak right now, we are in the final stages of installing our plant and machinery, and ramping up our hiring. Once we start trial runs, it will take about three months to get all certifications, such as BIS, ALLM, local approvals and certain global certifications. October is when we plan to start commercial shipments,” Ghosh said.

He added that the firm does not have any plan to acquire renewable energy projects in India and that it is not seeking any additional funding. The company, however, continues to assess opportunities for additional investments and further expansion in India. In India, the firm will continue to cater to power utilities instead of B2C companies.

Will take at least a year to get to 3.4 GW production

The plant, built on 130 acres of land, will take at least a year to start producing 3.4 GW of solar modules annually. When it is commissioned in October, the company is looking at about 6,000 modules a day.

“When we start off, we would be looking at about 50-60 percent of our nameplate. The plant is designed to produce about 17,000 modules a day, and once we get to that milestone, it will be about 3.4 GW per annum. But when we start off in October, we will be at about 6,000 modules per day,” Ghosh said.

The plant has a lot of process equipment which takes time to stabilise. In the beginning, the equipment does not produce optimally, which adds to the variability. It takes a year to get a sustained output.

Will export up to 2GW of modules

The plant is being built at an investment of $700 million, of which $500 million of credit line has been extended by the US Development Finance Corporation (USDFC).

“The modules from our plant are primarily meant to support the Indian market. But we imported most of our plant and machinery to build the factory and none of that is available in India. When we imported, we paid about 10 percent duty and 18 percent IGST (Integrated Goods and Services Tax). It is a total of about 28 percent duty, which one has to bear for capex. To offset that, we took the Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) licence, which is why we have certain minimum export obligations to fulfil. So, we will have to export anywhere between 1.5 and 2 GW,” Ghosh said.

Will take at least three years to localise supply-chain

The PLI scheme is going to pave the way for about 30-35 GW of high efficiency solar module manufacturing in the country. The same scheme will also lead to polysilicon manufacturing of about 21 GW. Currently, it is zero in India. It only means that for several years from now, the country will have to keep importing polysilicon.

But the gap in the supplier ecosystem is beyond that of wafers and polysilicon. There are not enough manufacturing units even for glass in India, which is also used to make solar modules.

“There is not enough glass capacity in the country. Glass is a very capital- intensive business. It requires big float furnaces to make float glass, and the gestation period for a float line typically is about three years because it takes a year for the permits, two and a half years to build, and these are very capital -intensive, energy-intensive processes,” Ghosh said.

Localisation of the component ecosystem is one of the main parameters, other than technical and efficiency parameters, based on which the government will grant the PLI amount to the allottees in about three years from now.

“The starting point is to import from the existing supply chain. We have two other factories in the same geography – Malaysia and Vietnam – from where we are sourcing our machinery and raw materials from suppliers who are supporting our units there. Hopefully, by the end of 2025, we will significantly localise our component supply chain,” he said.

CdTe panels have higher installation cost, better efficiency

First Solar is the only company in the world which manufactures solar panels using cadmium telluride, instead of crystalline silicon, which has a share of 90-92 percent in the global technology distribution of solar photovoltaics. The firm claimed it accounts for the balance 8 percent, as another company, Solar Frontier, which makes thin-film modules using a different material - Copper Indium Selenide (CIS) – only has a 2 GW unit in Japan.

“Our modules weigh about 40 kg, whereas the silicon-based modules weigh about 22 kg. Hence, our installation is typically 5-7 percent more expensive because you need more steel to install the module. Once installed, the semiconductor which we use responds better under hot and humid climate conditions. Typically, we produce 5-8 percent more energy for the same installed capacity, which offsets the slight incremental cost that comes from initial installation,” Ghosh said.

Slashing corporate tax biggest boost to manufacturing

Ghosh said slashing corporate tax for new manufacturing from 25 percent to 15 percent has been the single biggest policy instrument which made manufacturing of solar modules in India very attractive.

“The 15 percent tax rate cut, which the government did for manufacturing, put India at par with some of the other Southeast Asian economies, which are offering zero tax. But then you also had minimum alternate tax in the US. The 15 percent tax rate, compared with a huge domestic demand, is not there in some of the other economies. That balances things out and makes the case in favour of India,” he said.

The second big policy instrument, he added, was ring-fencing imports, especially to counter dumping by China.

The sources did not disclose the financials of the deal.

The first source said the partnership will be exclusive and see most of Warner's marquee content on the JioCinema platform. Warner cannot offer most of its popular titles to other Indian rivals including Amazon Prime Video and Disney Hotstar, said one of the sources.

""It's a deep exclusive arrangement which will make JioCinema the house of Warner, HBO in India,"" said the person.

Warner did not immediately respond, while Viacom18 had no immediate comment.

The content deal could bring in thousands of hours of streaming content onto JioCinema, which has become popular for streaming the IPL cricket tournament on the platform for free in the ongoing season.

Viacom18 won the IPL digital streaming rights from 2023 to 2027 for around $2.9 billion, rights which Disney previously held.

Several of HBO's top rated shows, including Succession, aired in India on the Disney Hotstar platform until March 31 this year, as part of a deal between the two companies that ended on the date.

Viacom18 recently received an investment of $528 million from Bodhi Tree, a joint venture between James Murdoch and a former Star India executive, Uday Shankar.

The first source added that Warner so far had various arrangements with Indian streaming giants, but the Viacom-Warner deal will see consolidation of that library and will include HBO, Max and Warner content, among others.

JioCinema is seeking to compete with rivals including Netflix and Amazon in a market where such platforms are becoming increasingly popular, thanks to cheap data prices.

But JioCinema is a small player. Netflix outperforms rivals in the subscription video-on-demand market, commanding a 39% share by revenue in 2021 compared to nearest rival Hotstar's 23%, according to Media Partners Asia.

Reliance Industries Ltd, India's largest company by market value, will commence natural gas production from its deepest discovery in the KG-D6 block this quarter, meeting 15 per cent of India's gas demand.

KG-D6 off the Andhra coast is India's only deepwater block under production.

The block averaged 20 million standard cubic meters per day of production in the January-March quarter, the company said in an investor presentation post-presentation of the March quarter earnings.

Reliance and its partner, UK super major BP are now nearing the start of production from their giant MJ deep-water project, which will significantly boost gas output from the prized east coast asset.

""MJ field is expected to commence production in 1Q FY24 (April 2023 to March 2024),"" it said.

The company, which is the operator of the block, earlier planned to start production in the December quarter, but it was delayed by three months.

Reliance and BP are spending about USD 5 billion on further developing KG-D6 through three different projects, aimed at rejuvenating gas production from the offshore asset. While the first two developmentsR-cluster and Satellite Clusterhave started gas production, MJ is now nearing completion.

Start of MJ will take KG-D6 gas production to 30 mmscmd in FY24, Reliance said in the presentation.

""Testing and commissioning underway in the MJ field,"" it said. ""One well opened as part of the ongoing testing of the integrated production system."" The company has already sold 6 mmscmd of gas to companies in the city gas, power and fertiliser sectors.

The two partners plan to use a floating production system at high-sea in the Bay of Bengal to bring to production the deepest gas discovery in the KG-D6 block.

The MJ-1 gas find is located about 2,000 metres directly below the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fieldsthe first and the largest fields in KG-D6 block. MJ-1 is estimated to hold a minimum of 0.988 trillion cubic feet of contingent resources.

The field also has oil deposits. Both gas and oil will flow from wells drilled below seabed to the Floating Production Storage and Offloading, where they will be stripped of impurities. Oil will be loaded on tankers for sale to refineries while gas will travel to onshore through an under-sea pipeline and onwards to customers.

South Korea's Samsung Heavy Industries-built double-hulled FPSO is built to handle 60,000 barrels per day of liquids and around 12.7 million cubic metres per day of gas. The floater is expected to have condensate production capacity of 30,000 bpd and water-handling capacity of at least 20,000 bpd, with the potential for the latter to be increased.

R-Cluster started production in December 2020 and the Satellite Cluster came on stream in April next year. While R-Cluster is expected to reach plateau gas production of about 12.9 mmscmd in 2021, Satellite Cluster will have a peak output of 6 mmscmd. The MJ field will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.

Oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3the largest among the lotwere brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block, was put to production in September 2008.

While the MA field stopped producing in 2019, the output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February 2020. Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production.

Located on Block KG-D6 in water depths of between 600 and 1,200 metres, the MJ development includes seven production wells to be linked to the FPSO via a pair of subsea drill centres. MJ's reservoirs are about 2,000 metres below the producing D1-D3 gas fields and the development is expected to be the third largest on the block.

Reliance holds a 66.67 per cent operated interest in KG-D6, with BP holding the remaining 33.33 per cent.

New energy investments will drive energy transition and the next wave of earnings growth for Reliance Industries Ltd, Chief Financial Officer Venkatachari Srikanth said in a press conference on April 21.

Reliance Industries on April 21 reported net profit, attributable to the owners of the company, at Rs 19,299 crore for the March quarter of the financial year 2022-23, up 19 percent from the year-ago period. The profit beat estimates driven by strong performance across businesses. Gross revenue from operations of the most-valued company came in at Rs 2.39 lakh crore, registering a year-on-year rise of 2.8 percent.

In a statement after the company announced its earnings, Reliance Industries Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh D. Ambani said the implementation of new energy giga factories at Jamnagar is making significant progress. ""This puts us on track to achieve our goals of transitioning to cleaner energy and enabling sustainable growth,"" he stated.

""I believe Reliance’s significant investments and strategic partnerships in the renewable energy vertical will help transform the energy landscape of India and the world, in the coming years,"" Ambani said.

Ambani is focusing on RIL’s pivot to green energy. The RIL chairman last year unveiled plans to spend $75 billion on clean energy projects over the next 15 years.

In 2021, Ambani had announced setting up of Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex at Jamnagar to establish four Giga Factories, and at Reliance Industries' 45th Annual General Meeting (AGM) in August 2022, he had announced its new Giga Factory for Power Electronics.

The clean energy business of the conglomerate will focus on building technologies, scaling capacities and creating a new energy ecosystem for India and RIL to achieve the ambition of net carbon zero. RIL aims to be net carbon zero by 2035.

On August 29, 2022, Ambani said the company aims to transition to green hydrogen production, from grey now, by 2025. The company aims to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen to under $1/kg by the end of this decade.",352,0.9387547075748444

Mukesh Ambani, the billionaire businessman and Chairman of Reliance Industries, celebrated his 66th birthday today, on April 19th. Ambani is one of the richest people in the world and is known for his contributions to the Indian economy and society.

Born in Yemen in 1957, Ambani is the son of the late Dhirubhai Ambani, the founder of Reliance Industries. He studied chemical engineering at the University of Mumbai before joining the family business in 1981. Since then, he has played a key role in transforming Reliance Industries into one of India's largest conglomerates.

Under Ambani's leadership, Reliance Industries has diversified into various sectors, including petrochemicals, refining, oil and gas exploration, retail, and telecommunications. The company is the largest private-sector company in India.

On his birthday, Ambani received congratulatory messages from several prominent figures and some, like Zomato, had a funny take.

“Happy b'day Mukesh Ambani, one of the only people who has never asked us for a coupon code,” the food delivery company wrote on Twitter.

The comments on the tweet were hilarious as well.

Other Twitter users to wished the businessman.

Rajya Sabha MP Vijayasai Reddy V wrote: “Wishing Shri Mukesh Ambani Ji on his birthday today. May Lord Venkateswara bless you with a long and healthy life. May you continue making us proud by making India’s corporate sector world-class and leading us to many revolutions like you did with Jio in telecommunications.”

“Wishing #MukeshAmbani a very happy birthday and many happy returns. Enjoy the insightful conversations as we break bread every time we meet. Congratulations on your vision and the execution to create a New India as evidenced by your companies and the Jio Centre,” Dr Shriram Nene wrote.

“The actual results of an investment over a long term of years seldom agree with the initial expectation.” - John Maynard Keynes

Stocks made it six in a row on Tuesday, but the lack of conviction at higher levels is evident. Global markets too are lacking direction. The last word on inflation and interest rates has not been said yet.

High rise

Godrej Properties shares rocketed 9 percent on Monday on the back of strong business update for the March quarter. With this, the stock has risen 20 percent over the last couple of weeks, outperforming peers. But then, Godrej Properties has been a sector laggard for a while, falling around 40 percent in FY23. Even after the recent rally, the stock is still quoting at half its record high price seen in October 2021. The company has surpassed its pre-sales guidance for FY23 by a mile, and that raises the question if the renewed interest in the stock signals a rerating move or if it is just a relief rally after the brutal selloff in March that almost pushed the price below the Rs 1,000 mark. The company has made losses at the operating level in 10 of the last 11 quarters.

Analysts tracking the sector blame it on the aggressive strategy pursued by the company. Initially, the market was hyper bullish on Godrej Properties also because it was considered to have better corporate governance standards compared to its rivals. FII ownership in the stock climbed from 19 percent to 30 percent between March 2020 and September 2021, as the stock rose fourfold from the pandemic lows. Since then, the stock has been struggling, as investor expectations were not matched by the operating performance.

“There was no reason for the stock to go up so much so soon, and when the market found cheaper alternatives because of the boom in the sector, Godrej was ignored ,” an HNI investor tracking the stock told Short Call.

Seen from the prism of price to earnings multiple, the stock still looks expensive. “But the medium term call would be on whether the company’s strategy is finally beginning to pay off. Realty P&Ls (profit and loss) are hard to decipher. Strong pre-sales need to be seen in the context of how much margins the company is making,” said the investor.

Low on gas

Shares of city gas distribution companies rose Monday after the government implemented changes to the pricing model of domestic natural gas as proposed by the Kirit Parikh committee. The reduction in gas prices helps city gas companies as demand had been falling for the last many months because of high gas prices. Leading brokerages reaffirmed their bullish views on the sector, but the stock price moves showed that investors were not overly enthused.

Why?

MC Pro analyst Nitin Sharma feels there could be two reasons for the guarded response by the market. One, the event was already discounted by the market when the committee had made the recommendations public. The government had little choice but to lower gas prices as part of its overall strategy to counter inflation.

Two, and more importantly, the price control will be applicable only for domestically produced gas. “Domestic gas production has been declining for the last many years. If demand is strong, you are not going to get enough gas under APM (administered pricing mechanism).

The shortfall will have to be met by buying gas at market rates, which are much higher. Also, the floor of $4 mmbtu means that gas companies can’t get prices cheaper than that. So you are not going to see the juicy profit margins of the past.”

Two-wheeler recovery

Things may be finally looking up for the two-wheeler segment, which has suffered the most since the pandemic broke out. Last week, Bajaj Auto sounded hopeful on demand recovery. Umesh Revankar, executive VC of Shriram Finance agrees with that view. In an interview to CNBCTV18, he said that demand is returning in the urban market and overall demand has been good in the last six months. Traditionally known for its expertise in commercial vehicle financing, Shriram is now stepping up its presence in the two-wheeler financing as it sees strong growth there.

Disruption ahead

Reliance Consumer Products’ ambitious foray into the FMCG market could rewrite sector rules, given the sustained disruptive pricing, and likely extension of credit to traders, writes Emkay senior analyst Nitin Gupta in a note to clients.

Gupta’s view of how it will play out:

“In the home and personal care segment, the initial thrust is on penetrating essential categories, where RCPL is looking to build its business at the mass-end (except laundry). HUL, Rohit Surfactants, Godrej Consumer, Procter & Gamble (P&G), Jyothy Labs and Reckitt Benckiser are expected to face the heat of RCPL's entry.

At this stage, Nestlé India, Colgate, Marico, Dabur and Emami are not likely to be impacted by RCPL's entry, while ITC and Tata Consumer may benefit from market development (as the market is highly unorganised).

Crude concerns

Investors are pulling money out of crude oil exchange traded funds despite the recent strength in oil prices, reports Bloomberg.

WisdomTree’s Brent Crude Oil ETF saw an outflow of $55.7 million last Thursday, the largest one-day fall since late 2019. Another fund, the ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF saw outflows of $158.5 million last week, the report said.

“There is still a large segment of the market concerned over the demand outlook and OPEC+ cuts would have likely only reinforced these concerns,” said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING Groep NV in Singapore.

Insider trading?

Two US lawmakers traded in bank stocks last month while working on a rescue plan for Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, reports Wall Street Journal.

“Nicole Malliotakis bought stock in a regional bank before a subsidiary agreed to take over Signature Bank’s deposits following its closure. Days before she bought the stock, she said she met with financial regulators to discuss the bank’s closure. Earl Blumenauer reported three trades in bank stocks as he co-sponsored legislation seeking to strengthen restrictions on financial firms in the wake of the bank failures.”

The battery war

After Japan and South Korea, it is now Indonesia. The island nation will propose a free trade agreement with the US for key minerals in the electric vehicle battery supply chain, reports website mining.com.

“Indonesia does not have a free trade agreement with the United States, but its nickel products have increasingly become important in the supply chain. It has been trying to leverage its nickel reserves, the world’s biggest, to attract investment from battery and EV makers, including US companies such as Tesla and Ford.”

Mixed picture

The US labour market is showing some signs of cooling at the aggregate level, but some industries continue to see tightness, reports the Northwest Arakansas Democrat newspaper.

Twiddy & Co, which sells property and helps homeowners rent to vacationers has sharply raised entry-level pay for seasonal workers. Owner Clark Twiddy said several companies have to treat employees as respectfully as they do customers, knowing that the best ones have ample job opportunities elsewhere.

1. Rural FMCG sales rise sharply in fiscal fourth quarter on higher grocer stockpiling

Sales of FMCG products in rural areas rose faster than urban sales in the fourth quarter of 2022-23. Sales for the whole year grew faster in rural areas as well than urban, according to data from Bizom. Rural consumer goods sales rose 16.8 per cent in the three months to January, showing 8.9 per cent growth for the full financial year. Urban sales grew 7.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, ending the full year with 5.5 per cent. Overall, FMCG sales grew 14.1 per cent in the fourth quarter and 7.8 per cent in the entire financial year.

Why it’s important: This growth cannot be seen as an indication of an overall recovery because discretionary spending on personal care, and confectionery are yet to pick up. The fourth-quarter rise can be attributed to stocking up at grocery stores. Inflation continues to hurt consumption.

2. Sovereign bonds fall past psychologically important 7 per cent, lowest since September

Yields on five-year Indian sovereign bonds have dipped below the psychologically significant 7 per cent, touching their lowest level since September, as the odds shortened on a protracted policy pause on interest rates. The central bank last week unexpectedly left the cost of funds unchanged for the first time in nearly a year. Profit-taking towards end of the trading session erased gains for these bonds, but outlook on short-term sovereign debt of up to 3- and 5-year maturities remained favorable. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.

Why it’s important: There are increasing expectations the unexpected pause in monetary tightening will eventually be a pivot for broader rate trajectory. It remains to be seen if these expectations are realized. Stubborn retail inflation could play spoilsport.

3. Private forecaster predicts below-average monsoon, posing risks to economic growth

India may see below-normal rains this year, with the onset of the southwest monsoon between July and September likely delayed by about 10-15 days, according to private forecaster Skymet Weather Services. Skymet in its first forecast for monsoon 2023 said rainfall will be 94 per cent of the long-period average due to the impact of the El Niño weather pattern, which is linked to droughts or poor rainfall in India.

Why it’s important: The forecast raises concerns over farm output, posing mounting risks to rural incomes, consumption, and economic growth. It could deepen the farming crisis, which still employs the largest segment of the country’s population.

4. Corporate India likely to report highly profitable fiscal fourth quarter

Brokerages expect Indian companies to report a rise in earnings for the March quarter of 2022-23 after a relatively muted showing in the preceding two quarters. The growth is expected to be led by financial services, FMCG firms, and automakers. The combined net profit of the Nifty companies, excluding Adani Enterprises, is expected to have grown 15.6 per cent to Rs 1.77 lakh crore from Rs 1.53 lakh a year ago. It was up 9.3 and 1.4 per cent year-on-year in third and second quarters, respectively.

Why it’s important: Despite the expected uptick in net profits, revenue growth might be losing steam due to sluggish demand and decline in commodity prices, which impact price realizations of upstream firms.

5. State Bank to raise up to $2 billion through overseas bond sales in 2023-24

The State Bank of India, the country’s biggest lender, plans to garner up to $2 billion in 2023-24 through overseas bond sales, dwarfing last year’s foreign fundraises by three of its closest private-sector rivals, including HDFC Bank. Its board will meet on April 18 to consider the fundraising through sales of senior unsecured notes. State Bank is expected to issue these bonds to overseas investors in multiple tranches.

Why it’s important: Despite the uncertainty in the global bond market due to the rising interest rate scenario, SBI is likely to take advantage of investor interest for bonds of state-run companies considered quasi-sovereign from an investment perspective.

6. Manipal Hospitals close to acquiring KIMS Health for Rs 3,500-4,000 crore

Manipal Hospitals, backed by Singapore’s sovereign investor Temasek, is close to acquiring Kerala-based hospital chain KIMS Health for Rs 3,500-4,000 crore. Manipal intends to buy the stake held by True North, which invested $200 million in KIMS Group in March 2017. Discussions are in advanced stages, and an announcement is expected soon. Founded in 2002, the Kerala Institute of Medical Sciences is a network of hospitals offering quaternary care in India and the Middle East.

Why it’s important: Once the deal goes through, it will be the Manipal Group’s third acquisition after AMRI Hospitals and Columbia Asia. The acquisitions could catapult Manipal to India’s largest hospital chain.

7. Reliance, WH Smith and other show interest in buying Future Retail

Reliance Retail, WH Smith, a consortium led by Boston-based restructuring firm Gordon Brothers, and April Moon Retail, in which the Adani Group owns a stake, are among 49 contenders that have submitted expressions of interest for Future Retail, which has a debt of around Rs 21,000 crore. It was admitted for insolvency proceedings in July last year after it was unable to repay loans. Resolution professional Vijay Iyer of Deloitte had sought expressions of interest a second time after the first round lacked enough participants and didn’t result in firm offers.

Why it’s important: Creditors of Future Retail would like to recover as much of their dues as possible. A buyer, on the other hand, would like to acquire it on the cheap since the status of many of its supermarkets and stores are under a cloud because the company failed to pay rent.

8. E-scooters drive electric vehicle sales to record 1 million in 2022-23

Electric vehicle sales in India roared past one million units in 2022-23, propelled by state incentives and robust production. Electric scooters, which tripled in sales, accounted for the bulk of the industry’s volumes, with sales climbing 30 per cent in March from the preceding month. EV sales in India rose 153 per cent in 2022-23 from the previous year to 1.15 million units, surpassing the cumulative 1.09 million sales until the previous year. All segments of EVs, including cars, three-wheelers, and two-wheelers, more than doubled sales, VAHAN vehicle registration data showed.

Why it’s important: The rapid expansion the sales of electric vehicles mark a significant stride towards sustainable transportation and green transition. Government incentives have proven to be effective in this instance.

9. Stockbroker Zerodha expects 20 per cent jump in revenue and profits

India’s largest broker Zerodha expects revenue and profit to have grown by a fifth in the financial year ended March. But there is a major correction ahead for the stockbroker firm in the current fiscal, founder and chief executive officer Nithin Kamath said. If current trends continue, overall revenues for Zerodha can decline by as much as 40 per cent in 2023-24.

Why it’s important: The volatility in stock markets, sparked by geopolitical tension that is impacting supply chains, recessionary fears, and interest rate hikes could be a dampener for brokers in 2023-24.

10. Government turns on heat on offshore online gaming companies

The Directorate General of GST Intelligence has cracked down on Cyprus, Mauritius and Cayman Islands-based entities offering online gambling and betting. These companies are not registered in India and were helping many wealthy individuals, including celebrities and social media influencers, launder money abroad. Tax officials have identified 38 such portals offering services in India that have not paid any GST. Initial estimates put the tax evasion at Rs 12,000 crore from April 2019 to November 2022. The tax department has issued notices to these companies and the investigation is ongoing.

Why it’s important: Concerns are rising over charges of money laundering and tax evasion by offshore gaming firms, which policymakers suspect are distorting the market. More stringent action by the authorities is expected.",1317,-0.037139234088716055
2023-04-06 14:23:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-targets-1-2-mmt-green-hydrogen-annual-production-in-first-three-years-of-incentive-programme-10372491.html,"The Union cabinet approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission on January 4, 2023.

The government has proposed an incentive of up to Rs 50 per kilogram (kg) production of green hydrogen in India, which will come down to a maximum of Rs 30 per kg by the third year of the scheme, documents seen by Moneycontrol showed.

After being approved by the Union Cabinet on January 4, the government released a blueprint for its ambitious National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) on January 13, with a total initial outlay of Rs 19,744 crore, of which Rs 17,490 crore has been kept for the production-linked incentives (PLIs) for producing green hydrogen and manufacturing electrolysers.

Now, the government has prepared the draft proposals for the two PLI schemes, copies of which have been accessed by Moneycontrol. The proposal on green hydrogen production states that the proposed incentive outlay will be Rs 13,050 crore spread over three years. “Beneficiaries under the scheme will be selected through a competitive bidding process. The incentive will start at a cap of ₹50/kg and end at a cap of ₹30/kg. Prospective bidders will quote the base incentive for the first year of production with the upper cap of ₹50/kg. Incentive is proposed to be higher in the initial period and will gradually taper off,” read the draft proposal.

With Rs 13,050 crore worth of incentive for green hydrogen production, the government is aiming at indigenous production of about 3.6 million metric tonnes (MMT) in three years. Annually, the target is to produce 1.2 MMT of green hydrogen in India for these three years. The bidding for the PLIs is likely to happen in three tranches, with a total bid capacity of 400,000 MMT in each tranche. The maximum allocation to a single bidder has been set at 150,000 MMT per annum. Senior officials in the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) said the government is aiming to open the first tranche by June this year.

Coming to the technical qualifications of the bidder, officials requesting anonymity said the average annual turnover for the last three years should be Rs 50 crore per thousand MT of their quoted annual production capacity (the estimated price of thousand MT hydrogen has been taken as ₹25-30 crore). “The bidder should have experience of developing at least 500 MW of renewable energy capacity over the last 4 years or producing at least 500,000 tonnes of ammonia or methanol or 100,000 tonnes of hydrogen over the last 4 years,” the proposal stated.

PLI FOR ELECTTROLYSER MANUFACTURING

For electrolyser manufacturing, the incentive will be offered for the first five years, reducing in magnitude. In the first year, it will be Rs 4,440 crore, Rs 3,700 crore in the second year, Rs 2,960 crore in the third year, Rs 2,220 crore for the fourth year and Rs 1,480 crore for the fifth year.

Officials said allocation of ₹4,440 crore can support about 3 GW per annum of production. “It is suggested to bid out the capacity in 2 tranches. Bid announcement for the first tranche will happen by June this year and the bid would be awarded by the second quarter of FY 2023-24. The total bid capacity will be 1,500 MW per annum and the maximum allocation to a single bidder will be 400 MW per annum,” read the proposal.

The technical qualification states that the bidder should have an average annual turnover of Rs 10 crore per MW of the quoted annual production capacity in the last three years. It also states that the bidder should have produced at least 100 MW of electrolysers over the last two years or should demonstrate technology partnerships with an entity that has produced at least 100 MW of electrolysers over the last two years.

It also suggests a possible performance multiplier matrix to reward lower energy consumption and penalise higher energy consumption to ensure high-efficiency electrolysers are pushed more.

Green hydrogen is produced using renewable energy through electrolysis and, thus, is carbon free. In this process, hydrogen is separated from oxygen in the water through an electric current. Renewable sources, such as solar or wind, are used to meet the power needed for electrolysis and, hence, the “green” is appended to this form of hydrogen.

Talking to Moneycontrol on March 25, Union minister for power and renewable energy RK Singh said that Kandla and Tuticorin ports will be India's first green hydrogen and green ammonia refuelling hubs for green shipping. He also said the government is working out a trajectory for the companies concerned to start blending green hydrogen into the city gas system, and the same will be done for the LNG they use for transport. Another trajectory is being worked out for sectors such as refineries, steel plants and so on, Singh said.

Companies such as Reliance Industries, Indian Oil, NTPC, GAIL, BPCL and so on have already committed to green hydrogen production in India.

India has set an ambitious target of setting up 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 and going net zero by 2070, which is why the NGHM will play an important role in the years to come.

1. World Bank, ADB slash India’s growth forecast to below 6.5 per cent for 2023-24

The World Bank has pared India’s 2023-24 economic growth forecast to 6.3 per cent from its December estimate of 6.6 per cent, citing slower consumption growth and challenging external conditions. The Asian Development Bank, too, has cut the country’s growth outlook to 6.4 per cent from 7.2 per cent earlier, citing risks from both global and domestic factors.

Why it’s important: The lower growth projections are mainly due to global economic slowdown, higher interest rates and elevated crude oil prices. Worryingly, domestic consumption growth also seems to be slowing down as earnings fail to rise in low-income households.

2. Reliance Industries secure additional $2 billion credit line from 18 banks

Reliance Industries has secured an additional credit line of $2 billion from 18 banks after obtaining $3 billion from 55 banks last week. The conglomerate has thus got a total loan of $5 billion. Reliance Jio Infocomm secured the $2 billion add-on facility with the same terms as its recent $3 billion syndicated loan. The funds will be allocated towards Reliance’s capital expenditures and Jio’s nationwide 5G telecom expansion.

Why it’s important: This is the largest fundraising through syndicated loans in India’s corporate history. It indicates the faith lenders place on the conglomerate’s ability to repay loans.

3. Market regulator’s move to reclassify start-up promoters may disrupt IPO plans

India’s capital markets regulator has started asking start-up founders who have at least 10 per cent stake to be legally classified as promoters. Portea Medical has reclassified its founders Meena Ganesh and Ganesh Krishnan as promoters, in the first instance where the Securities and Exchange Board of India intervened to get the founders to be reclassified as promoters. It has earlier said it was a professionally managed company and did not have an identifiable promoter.

Why it’s important: The change in rules could disrupt listing plans of several start-ups with low founder shareholding that position themselves as professionally managed entities. It could also lead to restrictions on their shareholding in the firm and higher disclosure requirements.

4. Stock market overseer to introduce regulations for passive mutual fund products

The Securities and Exchange Board of India plans to introduce the mutual fund lite regulations for asset management companies offering passive-only products in the current financial year. The framework would reduce compliance burden by 90 per cent and remove limitations on net worth and experience for those offering exchange-traded funds and index funds, where investment decisions are tied to changes in the underlying benchmark index.

Why it’s important: The mutual fund lite framework could be a game changer for the passive funds industry, which currently accounts for less than a fifth of the industry’s Rs assets under management. It comes on the heels of the regulator allowing private equity entities to act as mutual fund sponsors, and could further deepen the market.

5. LIC gains Rs 65,000 crore by placing contrarian bets on top 10 listed companies

The Life Insurance Corporation of India has recorded a Rs 65,500 crore gain in market value from its investments in the top 10 publicly traded companies in the year ended March 31, outperforming the benchmark indices. The companies made up almost 50 per cent of LIC’s portfolio. In contrast, Nifty and Sensex declined by 1.76 per cent and 0.49 per cent in the just concluded financial year.

Why it’s important: The contrarian investment approach by India’s largest investor in public markets has enabled the insurer to register gains even amid a market decline, a feat many fund managers struggle to replicate.

6. Hindustan Zinc unlikely to act on proposal to buy Vedanta’s zinc assets

Facing strong opposition from the government, Hindustan Zinc may not act on the proposal to buy parent Vedanta’s global zinc business for $2.98 billion in cash. As per rules, if the board’s January 19 proposal isn’t endorsed by shareholders within three months, it will automatically lapse. The government has warned of legal action if the company went ahead with the proposed deal. The firm was privatized over two decades ago, but the government still holds a 29.54 per cent stake. Vedanta holds 64.92 per cent.

Why it’s important: The failure will stress London-listed Vedanta Resources, parent of Vedanta. It spooked investors, as Hindustan Zinc lost 21 per cent since the proposal was mooted. Vedanta Resources could be staring at a crisis as the cash deal would have allowed it to pare its high debt burden.

7. SEBI chief briefs Supreme Court committee on Adani-Hindenburg issue

India’s market regulator has made a presentation to the six-member committee set up by the Supreme Court following the Hindenburg report on Adani Group on January 25. The presentation by Securities and Exchange Board of India chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch covered disclosures on related party transactions by both listed and privately held Adani Group companies. Other issues pertaining to the group, including offshore firms, foreign portfolio investor holdings and minimum stock market floats, were also covered in the meeting. Buch also briefed the panel on its policy for regulated short selling introduced in 2007.

Why it’s important: The report by Hindenburg led to an unprecedented fall in the share prices of the Adani Group. The Supreme Court has tasked its panels to ascertain the veracity of Hindenburg’s accusations of accounting fraud and stock manipulation. Adani denies wrongdoing.

8. Government cuts windfall tax to zero, duty may come back if crude prices rise

The central government has cut the windfall tax on selling domestic crude oil to zero from Rs 3,500 per ton after crude prices fell in March. The duty could make a comeback in subsequent reviews as the global oil cartel’s surprise production cuts have lifted prices again. The government has also halved the export duty on diesel to 50 paise per liter from Re 1. The cuts come after Brent crude fell below $75 per barrel in March.

Why it’s important: The windfall tax introduced in July last year as crude prices soared after the war in Europe, fetching extraordinary profits to oil producers. The latest duty cut may not last long as crude il prices are headed north again.

9. Carbon tax could be sticking point in discussions on UK-India free trade agreement

India’s proposed free trade agreement with the UK could face a major roadblock because Britain might impose a carbon tax similar to the European Union’s policy, which proposes to levy steep tariffs on imports with higher carbon footprints. The European style carbon border adjustment mechanism would dent India’s metal exports to the UK even if India and the UK agree on tariff concessions. India and the UK have completed six rounds of negotiations and are expected to sign the agreement shortly.

Why it’s important: Many developing economies like India view the carbon tax as a tariff barrier. It could hinder the proposed free trade pact as India would naturally like to safeguard the interests of its exporters.

10. More directors paid Rs 1 lakh per board meeting than before the pandemic

A larger number of companies are paying directors sitting fees of Rs 1 lakh per board meeting than was the case before the pandemic. This is the highest amount permitted under the rules. The share of Nifty 100 companies that pay their directors Rs 1 lakh per board meeting has risen from 37.1 per cent in 2018-19 to 41.4 per cent in 2021-22, according to data from the Excellence Enablers’ Survey on Corporate Governance. The number of board meetings have also gone up as the pandemic receded.

Why it’s important: The trend suggests that the authorities could consider raising the ceiling on the fees as directors now have more responsibilities than earlier.",1293,-0.39961448487113505

A multi-disciplinary cultural space, India’s first-of-its-kind, the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre, will open on March 31 with an exquisite showcase of the best of India across music, theatre, fine arts and crafts to audiences from India and the world.

The launch will feature a specially curated art and craft exposition called ‘Swadesh’ along with three blockbuster shows – a musical theatrical called ‘The Great Indian Musical: Civilization to Nation’; a costume art exhibition called ‘India in Fashion’ and a visual art show called ‘Sangam/Confluence’.

Together these will present the diversity of India’s cultural traditions and their impact on the world while also showcasing the diversity of spaces at the cultural centre.

Speaking on the eve of the inaugural day, Nita Ambani said, “Bringing this cultural centre to life has been a sacred journey. We were keen to create a space for both promoting and celebrating our artistic and cultural heritage in cinema and music, dance and drama, literature and folklore, arts and crafts and science and spirituality. A space where we showcase the best of India to the world and welcome the best of the world to India.”

The centre will offer free access for children, students, senior citizens and the differently-abled. It will focus on community nurturing programmes, including school and college outreach and competitions, awards for art teachers, in-residency programmes and art literacy programmes among others.

‘The Great Indian Musical: Civilization to Nation’ will see a line-up of exceptional Indian talent, along with a Tony & Emmy award-winning crew, and has been conceived and directed by Feroz Abbas Khan. The marquee production will bring together talents such as Ajay-Atul (music), Mayuri Upadhya, Vaibhavi Merchant, (choreography) along with 350+ artists, including an epic 55-piece live orchestra from Budapest, to showcase India’s cultural journey through history. The visual spectacle will also feature over 1,100 costumes designed by leading fashion designer Manish Malhotra.

The cultural centre, located within the Jio World Centre at Bandra Kurla Complex, is home to three performing arts spaces: the 2,000-seat Grand Theatre, the technologically advanced 250-seat Studio Theatre, and the dynamic 125-seat Cube.

It also features the Art House, a four-storey dedicated visual arts space built as per global museum standards with the aim of housing a shifting array of exhibits and installations from the finest artistic talent across India and the world.

Spread across the centre’s concourses is a captivating mix of public art by renowned Indian and global artists, including ‘Kamal Kunj’ – one of the largest Pichwai paintings in India.",441,0.816951334476471

1. Public sector banks to submit plan to government on tackling key business risks

State-run banks will submit a detailed scenario-mapped plan of various business risks within two weeks to the central government. They will also outline a communication strategy to deal with any exigency. These banks will also share information on provisioning made for pledged shares along with strategies to integrate market data of such securities. This mechanism will send out alerts, enabling banks to take timely action and steps to manage overall exposure to a corporate, inclusive of lending through pledged shares.

Why it’s important: The failure of banks in the US and Europe has rung alarm bells across the globe. The Indian banking system is resilient but increased vigilance and abundant caution is not misplaced.

2. Mutual funds hard-sell debt schemes before tax benefits ends on March 31

Mutual funds are asking investors to put money in debt schemes before March 31, when the tax advantage these products enjoy will come to an end. Investors are being asked to lock their money into long-term debt fund categories such as target maturity schemes, dynamic bond funds and medium-term bond funds, even if it means premature withdrawal from fixed deposits held in commercial banks.

Why it’s important: An unexpected change in the tax regime means earnings from fresh investments in debt mutual fund schemes will be added to taxable income and taxed in line with the income tax slab rate. This will make debt schemes less attractive from April 1.

3. Ultrarich and family offices to turn to alternative investments after blow to debt schemes

Since the central government has decided to end tax benefits enjoyed by debt mutual funds, wealthy investors and family offices could turn to alternative investment funds to chase high-yielding assets. The new rules mandate taxing gains from debt funds, irrespective of the holding period, at the income tax rate. The move has put an end to the long-term capital gains taxation and indexation benefits enjoyed by the Rs 40 lakh crore mutual fund industry.

Why it’s important: The surprising change in taxation rules has made debt schemes unattractive and will lead to investments in riskier equity funds.

4. More than 30 Indian cities prepare to raise money through municipal bonds

The central government has identified more than 30 cities with good ratings in the municipal bond market. Surat and Visakhapatnam are likely to soon issue these bonds soon, and Chennai could be the first of the big cities to do so in 2023. Surat and Vizag’s issuances are for specific ring-fenced projects and preparations are said to be at an advanced stage.

Why it’s important: The development comes at a time when there is a renewed push for deepening the municipal bond market in the 2023 budget. Urban infrastructure financing is one of the key agenda items for the G20 grouping under India’s presidency.

5. LIC plans record Rs 2.4 lakh crore investment in 2023-24 financial year

The Life Insurance Corporation of India plans to invest a record Rs 2.4 lakh crore across markets, including shares of locally traded companies, in 2023-24. Around 35 per cent of the total investment, or up to Rs 85,000 crore, could be allocated in shares of domestic listed companies.

Why it’s important: The massive investment could prop India’s stock market at a time when overseas investors are pulling out money from emerging economies in a flight to safer instruments.

6. Creditor of Reliance Capital fear recoveries below liquidation value in second auction

Lenders of bankrupt Reliance Capital are concerned that their loan recovery could fall below the liquidation value of Rs 12,500-13,000 crore for the financial services company since both bidders, Hinduja Group and Torrent Investments, are reluctant to improve their offers, bankers said. Hinduja Group is said to stick to its Rs 8,110 crore offer. Torrent Investments has declined to participate in the second auction.

Why it’s important: Although the Supreme court has allowed lenders to hold a second auction, the attempt by creditors of the insolvent company to maximize recoveries seem to have come to nothing.

7. Elder brother Vinod Adani played pivotal role in making deals for Adani Group

Although Gautam Adani is the public face of the Adani Group, the sprawling conglomerate that has been accused by US short seller Hindenburg Research of stock manipulation and accounting fraud has another family member, elder brother Vinod Adani, behind the scenes playing a pivotal role in the company and the activities that critics say misled investors. The Wall Street Journal has reported on some such deals where Vinod Adani played a key role.

Why it’s important: The Hindenburg report prompted a massive stock selloff that wiped out several billions of dollars in market value from Adani’s listed firms. The selloff seems to have slowed down, but the embattled conglomerate continues efforts to restore business credibility.

8. FMCG push by Reliance may spark price war in India’s organized retail sector

Reliance Consumer Products’ aggressive efforts to expand distribution in a short time as it enters the household goods market, a feat that usually takes years, is expected to trigger a pricing war, industry experts said. The unit of Reliance Industries, which unveiled its packaged consumer products brand, Independence, in December, has invested in and partnered with companies to gain access to categories such as beverages, biscuits, and chocolates.

Why it’s important: Reliance has a track record of rapidly expanding its market share, as seen in the telecom sector with Jio. FMCG companies in India will have to brace for a blitzkrieg in retail as well.

9. Overseas investors show keen interest in Niva Bupa’s $100 million fundraising

Temasek Holdings, Warburg Pincus and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board are keen to participate in Niva Bupa Health Insurance’s upcoming $100 million fundraising. The True North-backed health insurer expects a valuation of $2 billion for the pre-IPO capital raising. The prospective investors are already conducting due diligence.

Why it’s important: There has been recent investor interest in healthcare firms in a rapidly expanding Indian market. Increasing private healthcare means health insurers will also see significant business expansion.

10. Government will not reconsider building mega port in Great Nicobar Island

Development of the shipping sector will be crucial to reduce India’s cost of logistics to 7-8 per cent of GDP, shipping, and ports minister Sarbananda Sonowal has said. The Rs 72,000 crore mega transshipment port in Great Nicobar Island is one such project and the central government is confident about going forward with it, the minister said.

Why it’s important: The Great Nicobar mega project has faced criticism because of its environmental impact in a pristine biodiversity hotspot. The government is unlikely to back down.",1126,-0.3953023595469339

Campa Cola, that much-loved soft drink from the '70s and '80s, is set to return to supermarket shelves this summer. Mukesh Ambani's newly floated FMCG flagship Reliance Consumer Products (RCP) bought the brand from its makers Pure Drinks in August last year, reportedly for Rs 22 crore. The cola will be re-launched in a new contemporised avatar this summer. Campa Cola, Campa Lemon and Campa Orange will be rolled out in phases starting with Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and then across the country. The company is on a drive to acquire and promote homegrown Indian brands with a deep-rooted connect with Indian consumers. RCP has also acquired a 50 percent stake in the 100-year-old legacy brand Sosyo from Hajoori Beverages Pvt. Ltd this January. Lotus Chocolate from the Pai family, Sri Lanka's leading biscuit brand Maliban and its own JoyLand confectionery, and Independence and Good Life food brands are other important pieces of its portfolio.

The back story

An old Campa Cola advertisement. (Photo courtesy India History)

Coca-Cola entered India in the 1950s but made a hasty retreat two decades later when the Indian government introduced a regulation that would have required it to reveal its formula. Interestingly, it was the Pure Drinks Group that first introduced Coca-Cola in India in 1949, and was its sole licensed manufacturer and distributor. The Group which also owns the Le Méridien hotel in Delhi, decided to launch its own cola in the market after the unexpected and overnight exit of Coca-Cola from India. Since the company already had the expertise and the infrastructure — 12 bottling plants, plus manpower in excess of 10,000 — this seemed the natural thing to do. Pepsi had not yet arrived and the only other competition was the state-owned Double Seven and Thums Up owned by Ramesh Chauhan’s Parle Bisleri.

Campa which promised “The Great Indian Taste” was launched using locally developed concentrate in three flavours — cola, orange and lemon. Though apple and jeera flavours were added later, cola made up almost 80 percent of the product mix. In the 15 years that followed Campa went on to rule the Indian soft drinks market. It even used the same Coca-Cola font. During its heyday, it was manufactured in over 50 factories across the country, including four in Delhi. However, Campa started to lose its fizz by the mid-'90s, when Coca-Cola returned and homegrown Thums Up started gaining ground. It gradually disappeared from stalls and shelves across the country. Production of the drink at the Delhi factory stopped in 1999. The heroic comeback of the ‘Made in India’ brand after more than three decades is making many Indians nostalgic. And the fact that it’s backed by a home grown conglomerate is only adding to the excitement.

Can you bottle nostalgia?

Will nationalism and nostalgia alone suffice to throttle the strong base, aggressive marketing campaign and sprawling distribution network created by Coca Cola and Pepsi? Experts feel that nostalgia will definitely drive people to try the cola especially since its challenging international giants in the segment. But it will take a lot more than that believes Devangshu Dutta, founder of retail consulting firm Third Eyesight. “Though the brand has some latent awareness, it’s with a different segment — people in the late 40s and upwards. But the consumption pattern is driven by a younger profile. So Reliance will have to build the awareness and the stickiness for the product with the segment. And that’s a hard piece of work which is why I believe they have brought in the tried and tested tactic that they use — price wars. They have launched it at a price which has forced the incumbent two international brands to lower their prices.” Campa is priced at Rs 10 for a 200 ml bottle and Rs 20 for a 500 ml bottle.

Positioning will also play an important role in this, he adds. “Reliance will have to figure out how to position the brand correctly and make that positioning distinct from the existing players. Coca-Cola has always been about happiness, whereas Pepsi is all about the younger generation and Thums Up is about daring. Campa Cola will have to find its own distinct positioning. Without that they will just be a generic cola drink. Of course being the largest retailer in the country helps and their vast retail network will definitely be an advantage. But that can’t be the end of it.” According to sources, the company is expected to advertise Campa Cola heavily during the Indian Premier League (IPL).

According to brand strategy expert Harish Bijoor, Campa has the potential of emerging a viable competitor to the two big MNC colas Coke and Pepsi. “The brand has the power of being a local one, in an environment where the local is celebrated over the global. I do believe Campa can enjoy the power of desi-revival to give it wings,” he says but cautions that nostalgia won’t suffice. “The brand and its taste is long forgotten. It is important to stoke these dead embers. It is important to position the brand distinctly with USPs that scream the 'desi taste'! Desi tone, desi tenor and desi decibel will help.”

The branded non alcoholic beverage market in India is pegged at Rs 450 billion with Coca Cola, PepsiCo, Parle, Dabur and ITC being the key players along with several regional brands. The strong wave towards healthier options will pose some problems for the iconic brand feels Angshuman Bhattacharya, national leader — consumer product and retail sector, EY India. “The carbonated soft drink (CSD) market is witnessing headwinds (4 percent growth) as consumers are moving towards healthier beverages (12-15 percent growth). In this context, CSD is a tough and highly competitive category, hinging on bottling and distribution strengths. Campa Cola is a brand which is familiar to Indians, but will need large investments to scale. However with the largest retail house backing the brand, it could well be a success story given the larger modern trade and general trade platform available to scale it up.”

The return of the cola

Campa Cola Orange advertisement in Indrajal Comics.

Though Campa was synonymous with cola in the 1990s, today’s urban 20-somethings have only heard of the drink through nostalgic ramblings of their parents and older cousins. Incidentally Campa Cola gave actor Salman Khan his first TV commercial, much before he became a mega star. The 1982 advertisement showed Khan guzzling on the cola while on a yacht along with Tiger Shroff’s mom Ayesha Shroff and other models, while a catchy jingle played in the background. This was a time when Bollywood actors used TV commercials to break into the industry. “The creative was pretty much left to me. I had suggested, for some strange reason, that we do it underwater. A lot of people had done beach scenes, a lot of people had done parties scenes, music, beach parties, stuff like that. It was something different and I also liked to travel while shooting ads,” says advertisement film-maker Kailash Surendranath who shot the ad in the Andamans.

“Campa Cola used to be a birthday party treat or a drink we had at get togethers. We would also pack crates of it for long drives and picnics. There was not much choice those days as Coke had just exited the country and Pepsi hadn’t entered. But above all it was a great tasting drink — not too fizzy like Thums Up or overtly sweet like Gold Spot. It was just right,” remembers Swati Roy, an advertising professional.

Aarti Khandelwal a housewife in Delhi remembers visiting the Campa factory in Connaught Place as a student. “We were packed in a school bus and led to this factory where we were dazzled with how colas were made.

Piramal Realty, the real estate arm of the Piramal Group and Jio-bp have partnered to provide electric vehicle charging solutions across all of Piramal’s residential projects in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).

Jio-bp, a fuel and mobility joint venture between Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and bp, announced on March 23 that it has installed the first set of EV charging points at Piramal Vaikunth in Thane.

Under this partnership, customers and visitors to Piramal’s residential projects will be able to charge their electric vehicles at the Jio-bp pulse EV charging stations set up at the properties, using the Jio-bp pulse mobile app.

The real estate development company said in a release: “Piramal Realty is constantly seeking new ways to contribute towards creating a healthy, sustainable ecosystem while meeting the evolving expectations of customers who aspire to adopt a greener lifestyle. The installation of electric vehicle charging stations is in line with this goal.”

It added that sustainability is a “key pillar” of Piramal Realty's business strategy and the availability of EV charging infrastructure within its residential complexes will ensure convenient charging of electric vehicles while also encouraging potential EV buyers.

Notably, within a few years of operations, Jio-bp has constructed and launched several of India’s largest EV fleet charging hubs along with hundreds of public charge points in various cities and major highways across the country. Besides fixed charging, Jio-bp also offers battery-swapping services through its wide network of battery-swapping stations. Customers will be able to avail of both charging services using Jio-bp’s mobile app.

The company said: “To give impetus to the EV adoption in the country, Jio-bp is working together with demand aggregators, original equipment manufacturers, and technology partners. Backed by industry-wide partnerships, Jio-bp is on the path to providing the widest, most reliable, and completely differentiated charging network at the best value for money to Indian EV customers.”

Reliance Retail plans to open offline stores of its soon-to-be-launched e-commerce beauty platform Tira also, a top company official said on Monday.

The company would open its first offline Tira store in Mumbai and plans to expand its presence in the country, both in a 'shop-in-shop' format and standalone stores.

Currently, Tira's e-commerce platform, on which Reliance Retail is offering makeup, skincare, hair care, fragrances, bathing, men's beauty and luxury sections, is open to Reliance employees only.

This portal will open for customers soon, said Reliance Retail Director Subramaniam V on the sidelines of an event organised by industry chamber FICCI.

When asked about the offline expansion of Tira, Subramaniam said: ""It will come up in the month of April in Mumbai."" Though he did not share the number of stores Reliance Retail plans to open initially said: ""We would have a sufficient number of stores to take it pan-India."" He said, ""Tira would be the premium and for non-premium (brand), we still have to decide."" According to sources, there could be several tech interventions at the proposed Tira stores, including customised recommendations and virtual try-ons.

Tira could be retailing luxury products under a specialised category called Tira Red, he added.

Last year, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) bought a controlling stake in makeup and personal care brand Insight Cosmetics, which has the largest opening price points at leading e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart and Nykaa.

Subramaniam said Reliance Retail is one of the largest players in the beauty segment.

""We were there in personal care, hair care and the largest customer for Lakme. But now, we are bringing a kind of special channel for beauty,"" he said.

In a 2021 report, global market research platform Statista said that India ranked fourth in revenue generation from the beauty and personal care market, just behind the US, China, and Japan, projecting that online sales would grow 18.2 per cent in the next few years.

(Mukesh Ambani - File image)

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani on Friday announced plans for setting up a 10 gigawatt solar plant in Andhra Pradesh as his oil-to-telecom conglomerate bets big on renewable sources which can be converted into carbon-free green hydrogen.

Speaking at the Andhra Pradesh Global Investors Summit, Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries Ltd, said his group is investing Rs 40,000 crore for rollout of ultra-high speed 5G telephony network in the state.

""This morning, I am happy to announce that we will continue our investments and we will invest in 10 gigawatt of renewable solar energy in the state of Andhra Pradesh,"" he said without giving investment details.

Reliance had in 2021 announced plans to create by 2030 capacity to generate at least 100 GW of electricity from renewable sources, which can be converted into carbon-free green hydrogen. It is also investing in setting up giga-factories to manufacture components for the green energy value chain.

Ambani said his company has invested more than Rs 1.5 lakh crore in developing oil and gas discoveries it made off the Andhra coast and in supporting gas pipeline infrastructure to transport the fuel to consumers.

Gas from Reliance's KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal contributes nearly 30 per cent of of all gas production in the country, he said. ""This is just an example of how important Andhra is to the India story. And how deeply Reliance is invested in the Andhra story."" Reliance Jio, the group's telecom arm, is rolling out what it called a 'True 5G' network.

""We are creating the largest and the best digital network footprint in the state by investing over Rs 40,000 crore. Our 4G network covers 98 per cent of Andhra Pradesh's population, including those living in the remotest corners of the state.

""The rollout of Jio's True 5G will be completed before the end of 2023 throughout India, including your state of Andhra Pradesh,"" he said.

5G will trigger a new wave of digital revolution, creating large-scale business and employment opportunities.

Similarly, its retail arm has partnered with more than 1.2 lakh kirana merchants across 6,000 villages of Andhra Pradesh. ""Reliance Retail will source significantly more agri and agro-based products and manufactured goods from Andhra Pradesh for sale all over India,"" he said.

""I would like to assure you that Reliance will continue to be an unflinching partner to the people and the Government of Andhra Pradesh in your state's all-around accelerated progress,"" he added.

Strong quarterly performance which saw a 42 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,782 crore contributed to the high upgrades over the month for Bajaj Finserv.

Brokerage Sharekhan, has given the company a buy rating with an upside potential of 23 percent over yesterday's closing price, and believes the company’s digital initiatives will drive growth.

“For the general insurance business, the company is focusing on profitability and generating sustainable RoE (return on equity) while pursuing sustainable premium growth which is a key positive. The life insurance business is growing stronger due to its focus on a balanced product mix and new product launches. We believe strong growth in the lending business and an improving outlook for both the insurance businesses will likely act as a positive trigger for strong consolidated earnings going forward,” analysts at the firm said in a note.

Adani Ports, which saw a strong sell-off triggered by the negative report by US-based Hindenburg Research on the group, did not however lose favour among analysts, who gave buy recommendations on the basis of the company’s strong business outlook and positive cash flows.

Adani Ports may generate a cumulative operating cash flow of Rs 26,100 crore in FY24-25 with a capital expenditure of Rs 12,000 crore, resulting in Rs 14,000 crore of free cash flow, substantially higher than its debt-repayment obligations of Rs 11,000 crore, as per JM Financial. The brokerage sees a 35 percent upside at a target price of Rs 800 and expects Adani Ports to remain the market leader in India with volume growth of 16 percent, translating into revenue growth of 15 percent, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) growth of 15 percent and PAT (profit after tax) growth of 13 percent, compounded annually over FY23-25E.

HDFC Life Insurance got the maximum downgrades in February, followed by Divi’s Laboratories and Grasim Industries.

The budget proposal to tax income from high-value insurance policies (excluding unit-linked products) having premiums of over Rs 5 lakh annually has weighed in on HDFC Life, with its share price tanking around 20 percent since. HDFC Life’s share of the business of non-unit-linked policies with an annual premium of above Rs 5 lakh is over 10 per cent.

According to Phillip Capital, “HDFC Life will be the most impacted, given a higher share of single-premium product (Sanchay Fixed Maturity Plan), which constitutes around 20-25 percent of NPAR (non-participating insurance plan) APE (annualised premium equivalent),” said analysts at Phillip Capital.

A single-premium product or policy carries a large-ticket premium as it is paid through a single, upfront lump sum payment while a non-participating insurance plan is one with a guaranteed payout at maturity.

“(HDFC Life has a) very high dependence on a product which may go out of fashion or may have to be revamped or relaunched based on the new budget proposals,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research, HDFC Securities. He added that the company was the most expensive insurance stock compared to peers, which could have also led to high downgrades.

While poor performance for the last couple of quarters has resulted in high downgrades for Divi’s, the mixed outlook towards the pharma sector, in general, has also led to the inclusion of names like Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries in the list of top 10 downgrades last month.

“There are multiple pressures, one is on non-branded generic exports which is the weakest segment of the market. There is absolutely no pricing power, in fact, just to get the volumes going, these companies are selling at either cost or even below cost. So till there is price recovery in non-branded generics, which is still a fair part of all these companies’ business, that pressure will continue. The second is that while there is a reduction in input prices, margin pressure still exists, so it’s not like they are going to benefit. So I think the non-branded generics business is what is going to keep pressures on these companies for a fair bit of time till we see price recovery there.” said Abhay Agarwal, Founder of Piper Serica Advisors, a portfolio management services firm.

Quarterly upgrades, downgrades

Bajaj Finance topped the list for the highest upgrades over the past quarter followed by Bajaj Finserv and Adani Ports.

Bajaj Finance’s move towards digital transformation to increase growth in client acquisition as well as assets under management has made analysts more confident about its business model.

“Omnipresence strategy and organic momentum building up offer comfort on growth sustainability. We revise target price to Rs 7,250 from Rs 8,650 keeping multiple at ~5.7x FY25E ABV,” said ICICI Direct analysts.

Brokerage firm IIFL believes that Bajaj Finance is building an ecosystem to preserve customer cohorts across various businesses. With its fintech platform and health-tech platform, customers may not have to look around for products that Bajaj Finance doesn’t offer directly, it said.

With all its offerings under one digital umbrella, Bajaj finance is better positioned in terms of customer acquisition, engagement as well opportunities to cross-sell.

Among the top 10 companies with the maximum upgrades over a quarter, Bajaj Auto saw the highest number of buy ratings, rising to 34 versus 31 a quarter ago. The general uptrend in the auto sector along with its resilient performance in the face of global macro challenges had analysts upbeat on the stock.

Tech Mahindra, Divi’s Labs and HDFC Life were among the companies with the highest number of downgrades over the past quarter.

The number of hold ratings on Tech Mahindra’s stock increased to 15 this quarter from 11 a quarter ago, while buy ratings dropped to 21 from 29. Motilal Oswal, which has a neutral rating on the stock, said that near-term growth remains weak and they are waiting for more comfort in margins.

“Although its current performance remains muted, the company's high exposure to the communications vertical offers a potential opportunity, as a broader 5G rollout can result in a new spending cycle in this space,” it added.

Maximum upgrades, downgrades over past year

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) had the maximum upgrades over last year, with 32 buy calls compared to 23 a year ago. The hold calls on the company’s stock have also shrunk from 11 to 2.

The company is firing on all cylinders, said research firm Antique Stock Broking in its initiating coverage on RIL.

“While O2C (oil-to-chemicals) will benefit from the ‘platinum age of refining’, telecom is set to ride the 5G transition with significant tariff increase tailwind, robust growth in retail from aggressive investments so far, and the gas production growth driving earnings of oil and gas segment,” the brokerage said, adding that it saw an upside of 25 percent at a target price of Rs 2,900 apiece.

The O2C business stoked optimism in the light of earnings growth as well as refining margin recovery. The sector is further expected to do well with the International Energy Agency saying that oil demand will hit a record in CY23 and grow by 2 million barrels per day year-on-year.

ITC, Titan and Bajaj Finance followed RIL in terms of the most upgrades over the past year.

ITC’s stock witnessed its buy ratings increase to 35 compared to 27 a year ago on the back of consistently improving financial performance reported in the last few quarters. In its latest quarter, ITC reported a 21 percent annualized increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 5,031 crore.

“We expect the strong business growth momentum to continue across divisions. In cigarettes, we believe a pragmatic tax regime not only acts as fodder for illicit volume growth but also increases its predictability premium. We expect FMCG, hotels and paperboard to continue to witness improvement in business and margins supported by new launches and reach expansion. We increase FY23F-25F EPS by +2-3 percent to factor in the 3Q23 beat,” Nomura said in its research note.

Analysts at Motilal Oswal believe that ITC is still trading at a 15 percent discount to its January 2019 valuations of 25.4 times one-year forward earnings per share, even though valuations of ITC’s global tobacco peers have been restored to their pre-Covid levels.

“The stock has gained 45 percent since our upgrade to Buy call in Jun 2022 and we believe there is further scope for upside based on its healthy earnings outlook,” they said.

Divi’s Laboratories got the maximum downgrades in the last year followed by JSW Steel and Tech Mahindra, while Wipro saw the highest number of hold ratings at 17.

For JSW Steel the high debt had analysts doubting its steep valuation with many not seeing any upside in the stock price.

Tech Mahindra and Wipro seem to have borne the brunt of the slowdown in the IT sector in the last year of Tech Mahindra and Wipro have declined 22 percent and 32 percent, respectively, in the last year.",1510,0.5058347071920123

Nine of the 10 most valued firms faced a combined erosion of Rs 1,87,808.26 crore in market valuation last week, with HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries taking the biggest hit amid an overall weak trend in equities.

Last week, the BSE benchmark tumbled 1,538.64 points or 2.52 per cent amid concerns that the US Federal Reserve might raise interest rates further to curb inflation. Fresh foreign fund outflows also dented investor sentiments.

Barring ITC, all 10 firms, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, ICICI Bank and Hindustan Unilever, were the laggards.

HDFC Bank's valuation declined by Rs 37,848.16 crore to Rs 8,86,070.99 crore at close on Friday.

The market valuation of Reliance Industries fell by Rs 36,567.46 crore to Rs 16,14,109.66 crore.

The valuation of TCS tumbled Rs 36,444.15 crore to Rs 12,44,095.76 crore and that of HDFC tanked Rs 20,871.15 crore to Rs 4,71,365.94 crore.

The market capitalisation (mcap) of ICICI Bank fell by Rs 15,765.56 crore to Rs 5,86,154.58 crore and that of Infosys declined by Rs 13,465.86 crore to Rs 6,52,862.70 crore.

Bharti Airtel's mcap dipped by Rs 10,729.2 crore to Rs 4,22,034.05 crore and that of State Bank of India went lower by Rs 8,879.98 crore to Rs 4,64,927.66 crore.

The valuation of Hindustan Unilever slipped Rs 7,236.74 crore to Rs 5,83,697.21 crore.

However, ITC added Rs 2,143.73 crore taking its mcap to Rs 4,77,910.85 crore.

Reliance Industries continued to retain the title of the most valued firm followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Hindustan Unilever, ITC, HDFC, State Bank of India and Bharti Airtel.

The Republic Day break did little to dissuade the bears which were back in force on January 27, with the Sensex sinking 870 points to 59,330 and the Nifty slipping close to the 17,600 mark, as investors remained nervous ahead of Budget 2022-23.

Despite firm global cues, investors remained nervous ahead of Budget 2023. Here were the factors that dragged D-Street lower:

1 Budget 2023

Market participants are hoping the government will continue with its infrastructure spending and announce measures to attract more funds from the private sector.

If Street expectations are not met, market could see a fall. The FY24 fiscal deficit number will also be watched keenly. Foreign brokerage Morgan Stanley expects the fiscal deficit to be 5.9 percent of the GDP in FY24 against 6.4 percent for FY23.

“There is a need to consolidate the fiscal deficit. The starting point of 6.4 percent is already so elevated that markets will not like it if there is any further slippage,” Upasana Chachra, Chief India Economist, Morgan Stanley has said.

2 Big boys fall

Adani Ports and Adani Enterprises continued their free fall for the second straight session. The stocks ended lower by 16 percent and 18.5 percent, respectively. On January 25, Adani Ports had closed 6.3 percent lower.

Other heavyweights that dragged the index down were HDFC Bank, SBI and Reliance Industries, which closed 3-5 percent lower.

3 UN cuts India's 2023 growth forecast by 20 basis points

The United Nations has cut its GDP growth forecast for India for the calendar year 2023 to 5.8 percent, citing the effect of tighter monetary policy and weak global demand.

""Growth in India is expected to remain strong at 5.8 percent, albeit slightly lower than the estimated 6.4 percent in 2022, as higher interest rates and a global slowdown weigh on investment and exports,"" the UN's World Economic Situation and Prospects 2023 report, published on January 25, said.

4 FII selling

""Market sentiments are dampened by persistent FII selling, where funds are being shifted to other emerging markets as a result of attractive valuations,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said.

Till date, foreign institutional investors have already around $1.61 billion in stocks. Financials and IT have faced the brunt of this selling, followed by consumer services, oil & gas, telecommunication and autos.

The US economy expanded at a 2.9 percent annual pace from October through December, which was better than expected. Economists had predicted a 2.3 percent growth. This indicates that the US Federal Reserve might remain hawkish for a longer period of time.

Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani has ranked second on Brand Finance’s list of the world’s top CEOs. ""Brand Finance's Brand Guardianship Index 2023 saw the rise of Nvidia CEO CEO, Jensen Huang, and Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries Ltd to 1st and 2nd position respectively,” the report said.

The Brand Guardianship Index, released annually by brand valuation consultancy Brand Finance, celebrates CEOs who balance the needs of commercial success with long-term brand building and personal reputation management.

Mukesh Ambani has overtaken the likes of Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Google’s Sundar Pichai to rank first among Indian and Indian-origin CEOs on the Brand Guardianship Index 2023.

“Ambani continues to oversee Reliance’s transition into green energy, and the diversification of its telecoms and retail branches.

Diversified conglomerate and the biggest Nifty heavyweight Reliance Industries is expected to report double-digit growth in consolidated revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) for the October-December quarter, according to a Moneycontrol poll.

Net profit is expected to grow 4.4 percent to Rs 16,366 crore from a year earlier and sequentially by 19.7 percent, according to the average of estimates of brokerages polled by Moneycontrol. Revenue is expected to rise 21 percent YoY to Rs 2.23 lakh crore.

The company will report its December quarter earnings on January 20, after market hours.

While most brokerages expect RIL to report broad-based growth across segments, the retail and Jio verticals’ performances will be watched with particular interest.

“We estimate RIL’s Q3 FY23 consolidated EBITDA to grow 10 percent sequentially, driven by a recovery for the O2C (oil-to-chemical) segment on a low base, strong uptick for upstream and sustained growth across consumer-facing businesses,” analysts at Nomura noted.

Energy business

In the last quarter, the central government's special additional excise duty on export of refined products had cost the company Rs 4,039 crore. This had resulted in flat profit growth year on year. However, the windfall tax has been revised lower several times till then, and thus, O2C earnings will recover sequentially.

Tax on export of diesel now stands at Rs 5 per litre and the same on overseas shipments of ATF (aviation turbine fuel) now stands at Rs 3.5 a litre.

“This segment’s earnings would recover QoQ led by lower taxes aiding higher refining margins, though partly offset by lower petchem spreads,” added UBS. Jefferies has pegged this segment's EBITDA at Rs 12,893 crore.

Elevated middle distillate cracks, higher E&P (exploration & production) profitability on gas price hikes and currency depreciation will also aid earnings recovery, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE) noted.

Telecom and retail

Analysts expect telecom arm Jio’s ARPU (average revenue per user) to improve to Rs 179 from Rs 177 last quarter. A strong net subscriber addition of 7 million is expected to boost Jio’s EBITDA by 3-4 percent sequentially. Brokerages have forecast an EBITDA of Rs 12,635 crore in this segment.

Residual benefits of the operator’s lower Spectrum Usage Charge (SUC) will also boost its earnings, added KIE.

Reliance Retail is also expected to continue its strong growth show with an improvement in footfalls during the festive season and the benefits of operating leverage. The launch of its FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) brand Independence and the acquisition of Metro Cash and Carry were the two major announcements on the retail front last quarter.

Investors are keenly awaiting clarity on how the retail business is poised for future growth, with analysts expecting 25-30 percent year-on-year growth in the segment’s EBITDA.

The Street will also be watching for announcements on the new energy business and the progress of Jio’s 5G rollout.

2023-01-16 18:15:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/reliance-suspends-gas-auction-after-change-in-marketing-rules-9876521.html,"Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner bp plc on Monday suspended a planned auction for the sale of natural gas from their eastern offshore KG-D6 block after the government altered marketing rules to cap margins.

In a notice, Reliance and its partner BP Exploration (Alpha) Ltd (BPEAL) said the auction has been suspended indefinitely.

E-bidding for the sale of 6 million standard cubic meters per day of gas was originally planned for January 18 but was later pushed back first to January 19 and then to January 24.

On January 13, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas published new rules for the sale and resale of gas produced from discoveries in deep sea, ultra-deep water and high pressure-high temperature areas with marketing and pricing freedom.

It required bidders to state upfront if they were purchasing the gas through the auction for 'own use as end consumers (including for use of their group entities) or as a trader."" While end consumers were allowed to resale any unconsumed gas, traders participating in the auction were allowed to resell subject to a maximum trading margin of Rs 200 per thousand cubic meters.

""In any situation, which may require proportionate distribution of the gas offered under the bidding process, the contractor (company selling the gas) shall offer gas to bidders belonging to CNG (transport)/PNG(domestic) sector, fertilizer, LPG and power sector in that order,"" the ministry said, adding any leftover gas shall be offered to other bidders.

In the auction that Reliance-bp launched on December 29, 2022, the gas was intended for sale to end consumers who were not permitted to resale any unconsumed gas.

Also, there was no clarity on the participation of traders.

""It is hereby notified that the current bidding process is suspended till further notice,"" the two firms said in a notice on Monday.

It did not give the reason for the suspension but industry sources said the suspension was linked to the new rules brought by the government.

The two partners invited bids for the sale of 6 mmscmd, or a third of the volumes being produced at KG-D6, starting February 2023, according to the tender document.

Users such as city gas operators that convert gas into CNG for sale to automobiles and pipe it to household kitchens for cooking purposes, or power plants that use it to generate electricity, or fertilizer units that use it to make urea, were asked to quote a premium they are willing to pay over the JKM price.

JKM is the Northeast Asian spot price index for LNG delivered ex-ship to Japan and Korea. JKM price for March is around USD 21 per million British thermal unit.

Bidders were asked to quote variable 'V' in the gas price formula 'JKM + V'.

The starting bid for 'V' was initially set at USD (minus) 0.30 per mmBtu but later changed to USD (minus) 0.42.

Each bidder was required to enter bids that were higher than or equal to the starting bid quote, the tender document said.

The maximum valid bid for 'V' was initially put at USD 5.01 per mmBtu but later changed to USD 2.01, beyond which the bid shall not be accepted by the e-bidding portal.

The gas price was supposed to be higher of the government-set ceiling price for gas produced from deep sea fields or the price arrived at the bidding.

In May last year, Reliance-bp had auctioned 5.5 mmscmd of incremental gas from the newer discoveries in the KG-D6 block, benchmarking it to the same JKM gas marker.

Three-fourths of that volume was picked up by Reliance and its affiliates.

The price discovered in that e-auction came at a USD 0.06 discount to the JKM (Japan-Korea Marker) LNG price.

Prior to that, the duo had sold 7.5 mmscmd of gas at a discount of USD 0.18 per mmBtu to JKM.

The government sets a cap or ceiling rate at which natural gas from difficult fields like deep sea can be sold. This cap for the period from October 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023 is USD 12.46 per mmBtu.

Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production in April 2009, and MA, the only oilfield in the block, was put into production in September 2008.

While the MA field stopped producing in September 2018, output from D-1 and D-3 ceased in February 2020.

Since then, Reliance-bp is investing USD 5 billion in bringing to production three deep water gas projects in block KG-D6 -- R-Cluster, Satellites Cluster, and MJ -- which together are expected to meet about 15 per cent of India's gas demand by 2023.

The government of India while clearing the National Green Hydrogen mission on January 4 also earmarked incentives worth Rs 17,490 crore for its production and manufacturing of electrolysers.

But even as details of how these incentives will be rolled out are yet to be announced, a host of private sector conglomerates have already made pitches to go big on green hydrogen. Some of them announced their targets way back in 2021 when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman first revealed about India’s plan to harness green hydrogen in her 2021 budget speech and later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the National Hydrogen Energy Mission in his Independence Day speech in August the same year.

For starters, green hydrogen is produced using renewable energy through electrolysis and thus, is carbon free. In this process, hydrogen is separated from oxygen in the water through an electric current. Renewable sources, such as solar or wind, are used in the requirement for electricity for electrolysis and hence, the colour “green” is attributed to this form of hydrogen.

Moneycontrol takes a look at what companies have promised to accelerate India’s green hydrogen mission.

ADANI GROUP

On June 14, 2022, Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL) announced that it has partnered with France’s TotalEnergies SE to invest $50 billion over the next 10 years in India to produce green hydrogen and develop an ecosystem around it.

In the initial phase, ANIL aims to develop green hydrogen production capacity of 1 million ton per annum before 2030.

Last month (December, 2022), ANIL signed a development and licensing agreement with Cavendish Renewable Technology (CRT), a Melbourne based hydrogen technology firm, for development of alkaline electrolyses, polymer exchange membrane (PEMs), anion exchange membranes (AEMs) and CRT’s innovative “C-Cell” technology for mass scale production.

RELIANCE INDUSTRIES LTD (RIL)

On August 29, 2022, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries said the company aims to transition to green hydrogen production, from grey now, by 2025. The company aims to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen to under $1/kg by the end of this decade.

According to sources, RIL is in advanced talks with Hinduja-owned truck and bus maker Ashok Leyland for the development and supply chain of hydrogen-powered engines.

Bloomberg on January 5 reported that Mukesh Ambani will be focusing his attention on RIL’s pivot to green energy. The 65-year-old will oversee strategy, including the building of gigafactories and blue hydrogen facilities, will assess acquisition targets, and is talking to potential investors, the people said, asking not to be named as the information isn’t public.

Ambani last year unveiled plans to spend $75 billion on clean energy projects over the next 15 years.

INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LTD (IOCL)

IOCL is targeting to replace at least a tenth of its current fossil-fuel-based hydrogen at its refineries with green hydrogen as part of a decarbonisation drive. This year, the company is also going to set up subsidiary to house its green energy businesses.

“The company is venturing into green hydrogen production and is targeting 5 percent of hydrogen produced by it as green hydrogen by 2027-28 and 10 per cent by 2029-30,” the PSU’s 2022 annual report stated.

To start with, the nation's largest oil firm is setting up green hydrogen plants at its Panipat and Mathura refineries.

Besides, Chennai petroleum corporation, a subsidiary of IOCL, has recently issued an EOI for the design, manufacturing and commissioning f the electrolyser and related items for the production of green hydrogen at its refinery at Manali in Chennai.

ONGC

In July, 2022, India’s state-controlled Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and joint venture partner Greenko inked a pact to spend up to $6.2 billion on renewable energy and green hydrogen projects.

GREENKO-KEPPEL DEAL

In October, 2022, Greenko Group announced that India will for the first-time export green energy from 2025, with the first shipments going to a Singapore power plant as it signed a MoU with Singapore's Keppel Infrastructure.

Through the MoU, the two companies will explore opportunities in green hydrogen in India. They are working towards a 250,000 tonne per annum contract to be supplied to Keppel’s new 600Mw power plant in Singapore.

Greenko’s wide range of investments includes $5 billion in the storage of carbon-free green hydrogen energy across India

GAIL India Ltd

On May 12, 2022, GAIL announced that it has awarded a contract to set up one of the largest Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Electrolyser in India. The project would be installed at GAIL’s Vijaipur Complex, in Guna district of Madhya Pradesh, and would be based on renewable power. The project has been designed to produce around 4.3 MT of green hydrogen per day (approx. 10 MW capacity). It is scheduled to be commissioned by November 2023.

In January, 2022, GAIL had commenced India’s first-of-it’s-kind project of mixing hydrogen into natural gas system.

BHARAT PETROLEUM CORPORATION LTD (BPCL)

BPCL is going to install a 5 MW electrolyser system to set up a green hydrogen production facility in a phased manner in one of its city gas distribution projects. In June, 2022, it invited bids for the same.

In April 2022, BPCL signed a five-year Memorandum of Understanding with the Odisha government to explore the feasibility of setting up a renewable energy plant and a green hydrogen plant (both for domestic and export customers) among other things.

The company has collaborated with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) to work on alkaline electrolyser technology for Green Hydrogen production. It aims to scale up production of the electrolyser for commercial use, especially in refineries.

NTPC Ltd

India’s largest electricity producer, NTPC, plans to use about 5 GW capacity in green hydrogen and ammonia business out of its 60 GW green portfolio target by 2032.

NTPC has started three pilots on the hydrogen business. One is a pilot project of blending green hydrogen and natural gas at its Kawas plant in Gujarat. The second is in Leh where the company is setting up a green hydrogen filling station along with solar plants. The plan is to run hydrogen based fuel cell buses there as well. The third is a pilot project of producing hydrogen along with carbon capture at its Vindhyachal plant in Madhya Pradesh.

LARSEN & TOUBRO LTD (L&T)

Engineering major L&T commissioned a green hydrogen plant at its AM Naik Heavy Engineering Complex in Hazira, Gujarat in August 2022. The plant produces 45 Kg of green hydrogen on a daily basis, which is used for captive consumption in the company’s Hazira manufacturing complex.

The company has also signed an agreement with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay to jointly pursue research and development work in the green hydrogen value chain.

In January, 2022, L&T signed a pact with Norway-based electrolyser technology and manufacturer HydrogenPro AS to set up a unit in India. As per the memorandum of understanding, L&T and HydrogenPro will work towards setting up of a gigawatt-scale manufacturing unit for alkaline water electrolysers based on HydrogenPro technology.

In December 2021, L&T tied up with Nasdaq-listed ReNew Power to jointly develop, own, execute and operate green hydrogen projects in India.

HPCL

Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) aims to have a green hydrogen capacity of 24,000 tonnes a year, and hopes to commission a 370-tonne-a-year-capacity green hydrogen plant at its Vizag refinery.

Mukesh Ambani, the billionaire chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd., will be focusing his attention on the Indian conglomerate’s pivot to green energy, according to people familiar with the matter, after putting his children in charge of other businesses.

The 65-year-old will oversee strategy, including the building of gigafactories and blue hydrogen facilities, will assess acquisition targets, and is talking to potential investors, the people said, asking not to be named as the information isn’t public. Ambani last year unveiled plans to spend $75 billion on clean energy projects over the next 15 years.

Asia’s second-richest man is known for his single-minded focus on key pursuits: In the 1990s he lived for months in shipping containers to build what is today the world’s largest petrochemical refinery and about two decades later another of his upstart firms became India’s biggest telecom operator. Ambani has since handed the operational reins to his three children and turned his attention to green energy, which will see him go head-to-head with the region’s wealthiest person, Gautam Adani.

A spokesman for Reliance didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.

Reliance is seeking billions of dollars of investments in India’s energy sector and has approached potential investors including Middle Eastern funds, two of the people said. His ambition is to disrupt the sector just like he did with his mobile phone company Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., one of the people said, adding that the billionaire and his team were telling marquee investors they would own own every link of the renewables supply chain that can enhance margins.

Ambani’s dealmaking acumen will be crucial. Reliance spent almost $50 billion to build Reliance Jio, which became India’s No. 1 wireless carrier within some three years of its 2016 debut by offering free calls and cheap data. Then, over a few months of the pandemic lockdown in 2020, Ambani raised more than $20 billion for his digital ventures from a slew of investors including Silicon Valley giants, Meta Platforms Inc. and Google.

Reliance, with a market value of $206 billion, has a 2035 target for turning carbon net-zero. India’s transition from fossil fuels to renewables will provide an opportunity for Reliance’s continuous “hyper-growth” over many decades, Ambani told shareholders last August. Adani, on his part, has committed $70 billion to become the world’s largest renewables player.

Ambani’s focus on clean energy comes after he spent much of last year establishing his children at his empire’s other businesses. Eldest son Akash Ambani was named chairman of Reliance Jio, twin sister Isha Ambani will oversee Reliance’s retail operations and youngest Anant Ambani will be looking after the energy unit.

2022-12-28 19:08:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/how-the-jio-juggernaut-turbocharged-the-start-up-ecosystem-9777091.html,"“In less than 170 days, more than 100 million customers signed up for Jio's services. On an average, Jio added seven customers per second every single day. This was the fastest adoption of any technology service, anywhere in the world. Faster than even Facebook, WhatsApp, and Skype.”

“Today, we have 421 million mobile broadband subscribers on our 4G network. And they consume, on an average, nearly 20 GB of broadband data every month.”

It might seem that the above two assessments by Mukesh Ambani at the RIL AGMs of 2017 and 2022, respectively, talk about milestones achieved by the oil-to-telecom conglomerate. But many would say that more than anything else, they characterise the journey of India’s digital economy.

In the pre-Jio era of Indian telecom, data was a costly proposition. The average cost of one gigabyte (GB) of mobile data was Rs 226 in 2015, a year before the launch of Jio. Those were the days when people would visit the neighbourhood store every few weeks to replenish their phone’s storage with new music and films.

All that changed with Jio’s launch in late 2016. The company’s move to jumpstart the new telecom network by offering free voice calls across 18,000 cities and 2 lakh villages shook up the industry and thrilled potential customers. But the bigger thing was that mobile broadband data was also offered free of cost.

While this triggered a bloody pricing war over the next couple of years, the cost of data reduced drastically for the user. In a 2019 report, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) said that prices of mobile data had fallen by about 95 per cent (to Rs 11.78 per GB) in three years.

“The acceleration from 3G to 4G was driven by Jio, bringing more value to consumers of high-speed data at a highly affordable price point, the cheapest in the world at the time. This forced the competition to offer data at affordable rates,” said Neil Shah, VP, Research, Counterpoint, an analytics and research firm.

It also had a tremendous knock-on effect on the entire digital economy and helped the upcoming tech startup ecosystem take root and flourish, say industry watchers.

“As a result, the first internet experience for a majority of Indians was on their smartphone. Building internet services for them was, therefore, smartphone led. Startups had a much larger addressable market, and the cost of reaching and retaining their customers came down exponentially,” said Pranav Pai, Managing Partner of venture capital (VC) firm 3One4 Capital.

“Over $400 billion of market cap has already been built on top of this foundation, and we can see it going to $1 trillion within this decade,” he added.

Coupled with the digital architecture of the India Stack that comprises pillars like Aadhaar, United Payments Interface (UPI), etc., cheap data has unleashed a massive uptake of online content, digital payments, and e-commerce. According to government data, the number of digital transactions have risen from 72 crore in October 2016 (the month before demonetisation and a month after Jio’s launch) to 989 crore in October 2022 — a 14X jump in six years.

“At first, Jio led to a mass adoption of the internet in the country, then came the consumption of social media (SM) and content, and thereafter, digital transactions. Before Jio, the question that used to be asked was how to reach the consumer or how will a farmer know about the latest government scheme. Today, that’s not a question anymore,” said Sreedhar Prasad, an internet sector expert.

As a result of the increasing digital transactions, India has become one of the focal points of the global tech startup investment landscape. While many VC firms had already set up shop in India around 2010, there were very few startups which saw large funding rounds.

This was because low internet penetration meant a very small addressable market in India — only 7.5 percent of the population was hooked up to the internet in 2010. That year, 415 startups raised a total of $513 million in the country, according to Tracxn data.

As the internet penetration grew to around 15 percent in 2015, startup funding peaked at $8.2 billion across 1,662 deals — an average cheque size of about $5 million. But, the growth in internet adoption brought about by Jio’s entry — 30 percent penetration by 2020 — worked wonders for startups.

When the pandemic came in 2020, it was all about contactless commerce, and the tech sector was ready to capitalise on it. Barring the disruption created by the lockdown in the first few months, digital payments and e-commerce rose multi-fold.

Edtech startups offering online courses, like Byju’s and Unacademy, hyperlocal commerce companies like Zomato and Swiggy, e-commerce marketplaces like Udaan and Meesho, fintech unicorns like Paytm, BharatPe, and Razorpay, among others, have raised billions of dollars in big-ticket investments in the last couple of years.

Despite a global slowdown in tech investment, around 2,000 Indian startups have raised a total of $26 billion this year — at an average cheque size of $13 million, a 160 percent growth compared to the pre-Jio year of 2015.

“All these companies rode the wave of data consumption that Jio brought on. Any unicorn — whether B2B or B2C — which serves the mass market of consumers or merchants has benefitted,” said Prasad.

Metro AG global chief executive officer Steffen Greubel has hinted that the company might exit from India soon, The Economic Times reported on December 20.

The company is at a “very advanced” level of discussions on its India business. “We are very advanced in the process regarding India and are at a certain maturity level in the process. It’s too early to share any information, but we have discussed it greatly,” Greubel reportedly told analysts when asked if he is looking at a possible withdrawal from India and the status of talks. “We are very deep in the (sale) process in India,” he said last week while announcing annual earnings.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

As per its latest annual report, German wholesaler grew its Indian business by 21 percent to $982 million during the year-ended September.

Reportedly, the world’s fourth-largest retailer by revenue may have decided to exit the country due to heightened competition, a tougher regulatory environment and the lack of a level playing field between local and foreign retail companies.

However, in January this year, the group was aiming for robust growth via wholesale and e-commerce, and had denied any rumours about a certain exit from Belgium and India.

In November, industry sources said that Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries is set to acquire German retailer METRO AG's Cash & Carry business in India in a deal estimated at around 500 million euros (Rs 4,060 crore). The deal includes 31 wholesale distribution centres, land banks and other assets owned by METRO Cash & Carry here, they added.

METRO AG, which operates in 34 countries, entered the Indian market in 2003.

It operates six stores in Bengaluru, four in Hyderabad, two each in Mumbai and Delhi, and one each in Kolkata, Jaipur, Jalandhar, Zirakpur, Amritsar, Ahmedabad, Surat, Indore, Lucknow, Meerut, Nasik, Ghaziabad, Tumakuru, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Guntur and Hubballi.",338,0.478276863694191

Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is in advanced talks with Hinduja-owned truck and bus maker Ashok Leyland for the development and supply chain of hydrogen-powered engines, The Economic Times reported quoting two people with the knowledge of the development.

Ashok Leyland will install fuel-cell engines in an existing fleet of 45,000 trucks that RIL has hired to transport refined products and other marketing goods as a first stage in the strategy, the sources said. This will allow the trucks to run on green hydrogen rather than diesel.

Beginning in 2025, Reliance intends to manufacture green hydrogen at its refinery facility in Jamnagar. With the advancement of technology, there are plans to increase the supply of hydrogen to the greater automobile market, especially for buses and taxis, the report said.

""RIL has reached out to Ashok Leyland for the development of these engines. The plan is to use these engines for the fleet of trucks RIL uses and, of course, going expand this to the larger automotive market,"" ET quoted one of the people. ""Currently the plan envisages retrofitting the engines of these Ashok Leyland fleet of trucks before moving on to the fleet of other service providers. These retro-fittings would take place across Ashok Leyland's truck workshops in the country.""

The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the business plans are still in the private domain. The report quoted one of the sources as saying that this may include expanding the scope of cooperation with Ashok Leyland or forming similar partnerships with other automakers.

It is unclear at this time whether RIL would eventually partner with cab aggregators like Ola or Uber.

According to the sources, RIL and Ashok Leyland are finalising the partnership's structure, prospective equity commitment, and capital expenditures.

The two companies did not react to questions sent by ET.

Green hydrogen is the cleanest form of fuel when produced through renewable sources of energy. This August, at RIL's AGM, Chairman Mukesh Ambani had unveiled his plan to shift to green hydrogen with an aim to start the transition by 2025.

Ambani said that while the company is one of the largest producers of grey hydrogen globally, it is assessing new technologies for making electrolysers in its efforts to produce low-cost green hydrogen in the country.

Ashok Leyland and RIL have an existing collaboration where Ashok Leyland provides driver training for RIL's supply chain division. In Gujarat, RIL operates three driving schools and in terms of truck supplies, while Ashok Leyland is RIL's main supplier.

According to sources in the report, RIL intends to establish itself as a market leader in the transportation sector as India prioritises green hydrogen as a potential option to decarbonise industries and transportation.

Additionally, the business is interested in creating an ecosystem for the fuel and reaching a critical mass because it will be a major producer of green hydrogen in the future.

A government-appointed gas price review panel, led by Kirit Parikh, is likely to recommend price caps for natural gas produced from legacy fields of state-owned firms to help moderate CNG and piped cooking gas rates, while keeping the pricing formula for difficult fields unchanged.

The panel, which was tasked with suggesting a ""fair price to the end-consumer"" while ensuring ""market-oriented, transparent and reliable pricing regime for India's long-term vision for ensuring a gas-based economy"", may opt to suggest two different pricing regimes, officials said.

For the legacy or old fields of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) -- where the cost has long been recovered and which are currently governed by a formula that uses rates in gas-surplus nations such as the US, Canada and Russia -- the committee is likely to recommend a floor or minimum base price and cap or ceiling rates.

This would ensure that prices do not fall below cost of production, as they did last year, or do not spike to record levels as currently.

Gas from legacy fields is sold to city gas distributors who had to raise rates of CNG and piped cooking gas by over 70 per cent after prices went up from USD 2.90 per million British thermal unit till March to USD 6.10 in April and further to USD 8.57 last month, reflecting a surge in global rates. This rise in rates, which narrowed the gap between CNG and polluting diesel, had prompted the review.

For the gas from difficult fields such as those lying in deepsea or which are in high-pressure, high-temperature zones, the committee is likely to suggest not tinkering with the existing mechanism of paying them higher rates based on a different formula to compensate for the greater risk and cost involved, officials said.

This would ensure that explorers, who are seeing a surge in cost of services due to the spike in global energy rates, are not put at a disadvantage.

This way the concerns over investments in exploration and production (E&P) being hit would also be addressed, they said, adding that market-driven pricing would also encourage new investments and attract global players.

KG-D6 fields of Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner bp plc of UK are governed by the pricing formula for difficult fields. Rates for difficult fields from October 1 is USD 12.46 per mmBtu.

The panel headed by former planning commission member Kirit S Parikh is in the final stages of finalising its report. It would be submitted to the government in the next few days, the officials said, adding the cap for the legacy fields is likely to be higher than USD 4.75 per mmBtu cost of production and the floor could be set at USD 3.50.

The oil ministry will process the recommendations before moving the Cabinet for approval for changes in the existing gas pricing regime.

Natural gas is a fossil energy source that is formed deep beneath the earth's surface. It is used to generate electricity, produce fertiliser and petrochemicals, converted into CNG to run automobiles and piped to household kitchens for cooking and heating. It is also used in making glass, steel, cement, bricks, ceramics, tile, paper, food products, and many other commodities as a heat source.

Its prices remained docile till March 2022 but have shot up in recent months, raising the cost of production of user industries in general and city gas operators that sell CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households, in particular.

To keep rates under check so that they do not add fire to the already high inflation, the government formed a committee to review the way prices of gas produced in India are fixed.

The panel includes representatives of the gas producers association as also state-owned producers ONGC and OIL, a member from private city gas operators, state gas utility GAIL, a representative of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and a member from the fertiliser ministry.

In the panel meetings, the producers insisted on complete market freedom as had been guaranteed in the contracts they signed for finding and producing the fuel, while consumers wanted a ""fair price"", officials said.

Producers argue that artificially controlling prices would dry up investments in exploration. Consumers, particularly the city gas sector, felt that the environment-friendly fuel would lose out to other hydrocarbon fuels if the prices were not reasonable, they said.

The panel is of the view that an attempt has to be made to see that investments in exploration are not dissuaded. At the same time, the momentum that the city gas sector has got should not be disturbed.

The Modi government had in 2014 used prices in gas surplus countries to arrive at a formula for locally produced gas. Rates, according to this, are set every six months -- on April 1 and October 1 -- each year based on prices prevalent in gas surplus nations such as the US, Canada and Russia in one year with a lag of one quarter.

The rates according to this formula were subdued and at times lower than the cost of production till March 2022, but rose sharply thereafter, reflecting the surge in global rates in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The price of gas from old fields, which are predominantly of state-owned producers like ONGC and Oil India Ltd, was more than doubled to USD 6.1 per mmBtu from April 1, and to USD 8.57 9 per mmBtu from October 1.

Similarly, the rates paid for gas from difficult fields such as deep sea KG-D6 went up to USD 9.92 per mmBtu from April 1 against USD 6.13 per mmBtu. They rose to USD 12.46 per mmBtu last month.

Officials said the panel recommendations will aid in meeting the government target of more than doubling the share of natural gas in the primary energy basket to 15 per cent by 2030 from the current 6.7 per cent.",995,0.016212821006774902

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has dropped BSNL from the 4G speed chart in October as it is yet to roll out 4G services. In October, the telecom major maintained its leadership in download segment by recording an average speed of 20.3 megabits per second (mbps).

It was followed by Airtel, which recorded a download speed of 15 mbps and Vodafone Idea (Vi) with 14.5 mbps speed. Jio’s 4G upload speed declined marginally to 6.2 mbps in October from 6.4 mbps in September. However, it continued to maintain its lead in the segment.

In September, Jio had pipped Vi to top the upload speed segment. Jio was followed by Vi which recorded an average upload speed of 4.5 mbps in October and Airtel with an average upload of 2.7 mbps The average speed is computed by Trai based on the data it collects across India with the help of its MySpeed application on a real-time basis.

Reliance Retail plans to enter the salon business by acquiring a stake in Chennai-based Naturals Salon & Spa, the Economic Times reported on November 4, citing unidentified executives in the know of the matter.

The retail arm of the oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd is in talks to acquire a 49 percent stake in Groom India Salons & Spa, the parent company of Naturals Salon & Spa.

Naturals Salon has around 700 outlets in India and Reliance wants to expand it to over 3,000 outlets, the anonyms official told ET. “However, the existing promoters could continue running its operations and Reliance’s funding will help network expansion,” the report said.

The Rs 20,000-crore salon industry was the worst-hit sector during the Covid-19 pandemic.

CK Kumaravel, the CEO of Naturals Salon & Spa, confirmed the development, saying that the negotiations are at a ‘nascent stage’.

The entry of the two home-grown majors is a ""great opportunity"" albeit with enhanced competition and Coca-Cola India would invest to develop the market further and bring innovations to evolve the category and ultimately benefit the consumers, he said here in an interaction.

Ray, however, said the entry of Reliance Retail and Tata Consumer Products can result in ""some disruptions at the local level"" leading to consolidation, but pricing will not be a game changer.

""This category penetration is one of the lowest in FMCG. Coke and Pepsi do not have enough budget to get into that,"" he said when asked how the market dynamics would be with the entry of new players.

Reliance Retail had acquired the home-grown brand Campa Cola signalling its intention to enter the soft drinks market in India. TCPL, Tata group's FMCG arm, is expanding its presence in the beverage market.

""If TCPL and Reliance come, they would put more money into the market. This category would expand from commercial to non-commercial level,"" he added.

According to him, Coca-Cola and Pepsi together control over 65 per cent of the market and the rest 35 per cent is still controlled by other beverage makers.

""There is space for more players,"" he said, adding, already new players like TCPL are doing well.

This would help bring in some consolidation at the local level, which he sees as ""positive"" as the larger players would bring more money in advertising and help the category to evolve finally.

Citing the examples of the spices segment, in which several FMCG companies such as Dabur, Emami, and ITC have entered, now the market has started moving towards branded from non-branded.

""For me, that's a great opportunity,"" he said, adding he respects TCPL and Reliance, which are top-rated companies and ""space is there"" for more players.

On the pricing pressure due to competition, he said, ""Only pricing will not be a game changer. They will operate at different levels they would bring a lot of innovations and disruptions. It is good for the overall industry."" When asked whether Coca-Cola may face stiff competition from Campa Cola in the modern trade format, as Reliance is the largest retailer in the country, Ray said it may get the initial first level of placement at their stores.

However, he said, stocks at the stores have to be rotated and ""if the stock does not move then Reliance Retail also has to deliver the stockholder's value as well"".

When asked about the rural demand, Ray said, now it is growing along with the urban market. Moreover, rural sales would also get help from good monsoons and increased government spending towards those areas.

However, he also added that lower price points are doing well and high price points are not doing well and hence there is pressure on larger packs.

Over Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), Ray said: ""We see a potential in that"". Coca-Cola is registering itself as a supplier on ONDC, which is an initiative of the government to promote an open platform for all aspects of the exchange of goods and services through electronic networks.

Presently around 2.4 per cent of sales come from e-commerce and it is expected to grow.

Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) on October 31 stated that it will use FRX Innovations’ Nofia technology to enhance the sustainable edge of its ""well-established"" Recron FS, a fire-resistant polyester staple fibre.

Nofia’s polymeric phosphorus-based chemistry helps make Recron FS more sustainable and technically superior for polyester textile applications. Its additives are certified by OEKO-TEX Standard 100 for textile applications and other sustainability certifications such as ChemForward, Green Screen and TCO accrediting that the technology meets these global standards of safety and sustainability, RIL said in a statement.

As the world is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic impact, sustainable textiles have seen a resurgence in demand as many leading textile companies are embedding their environmental and social responsibility goals as a part of their post-pandemic growth strategy.

To meet the goals of a circular economy (including the 3Rs of the waste hierarchy: reduce, recycle, and reuse), textile manufacturers are relying on innovative technologies that enable sustainable products. As per RIL's statement, the global textile flame retardants market size was valued at $519.5 million in 2021 and is anticipated to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.6 percent from 2022 to 2030.

RIL added that it is seeing increasing interest from leading global textile companies for more sustainable, eco-friendly, fire-retardant technologies. ""Recron FS is a part of RIL’s extensive R&D achievements in attaining its commitment to launch new products that are completely sustainable throughout-out their lifecycle and responsibly using natural resources.""

Recron FS-based fabrics are used by Indian Railways in seats and curtains due to their cost-effectiveness, fire safety and durability.

How FRX Innovations' Nofia works on polyester?

Reliance has developed a new fire-resistant polyester solution, Recron FS, with FRX Innovations’ Nofia, technology at its core. FRX Innovations’ Nofia polymeric phosphorus additives deliver improved tenacity in RIL’s polyester textiles and is the only flame-retardant technology that allows for the use of recycled polyester as a feedstock to contents above 60 percent, with the capability of reaching above 90 percent. The ability to use it with recycled polyester makes it a sustainable technology which is proving to be of interest for multiple end-users. The new technology also enables adjustable flame retardancy from levels of 7,000 ppm to 25,000 ppm of phosphorus, depending on end-user needs, making it an attractive solution in multiple markets.

Commenting on the partnership, Hemant D. Sharma, Sector Head – Polyester Business, RIL, said, “We are very proud in bolstering Recron FS on safety and technical parameters with FRX’s Nofia technology. We are committed to deliver exceptional fire safety without compromising health, environment, and aesthetics.”

Further, Marc Lebel, CEO of FRX Innovations, commented, “For years now, consumer interest in sustainability has been steadily increasing. It is rewarding to see Nofia being deployed in such high-visibility consumer products. With ever-increasing pressure to deliver sustainable products to the market, we believe that FRX Innovations is well positioned to grow with sustainably minded customers around the world such as Reliance.”

Additionally, the Charles de Gaulle terminal 2 airport, recently unveiled its interior refurbishment featuring Recron FS polyester in its new airport furniture. Moreover, a Spain-based furniture designers, Happers has specified Recron FS yarns in their new collection of lounge chairs citing its beauty, safety, and sustainability attributes.

The financial services arm of the Aditya Birla Group has expressed intent to pick up 51 per cent stake of Reliance Capital in Reliance Nippon Life Insurance Company (RNLIC), sources said.

Reliance Nippon Life Insurance is a 51:49 joint venture between Reliance Capital and Nippon Life of Japan. When contacted, Aditya Birla Capital Ltd declined to comment on the issue. Reliance Nippon Life Insurance was the only subsidiary of Reliance Capital that had not received any bid when the deadline for submission of non-binding bids had ended on August 29.

Reliance Capital Ltd (RCL) had received 14 non-binding bids for its multiple businesses. Six companies had submitted bids for the entire company, while the rest of the bidders had submitted offers for its multiple subsidiaries.

The last date for submitting the binding bids is October 31. Two options are available for the bidders. Under the first, bidders are required to submit bids for entire RCL and in the second one, they have the choice to bid for specific verticals of the company.

Apart from Aditya Birla Capital, Torrent Group has partnered with Nippon Life Insurance to bid for Reliance Capital’s 51 per cent stake in Reliance Nippon Life Insurance Company as part of the resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

A valuer appointed by the administrator has pegged the embedded value of the life insurance company at Rs 5,800 crore, sources said. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had on November 29 last year superseded the board of RCL in view of payment defaults and serious governance issues.

The RBI appointed Nageswara Rao Y as the administrator in relation to the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) of the firm. This is the third large non-banking financial company (NBFC) against which the central bank has initiated bankruptcy proceedings under IBC.

The other two were Srei Group NBFC and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL). The RBI subsequently filed an application for initiation of CIRP against the company at the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

In February this year, the RBI-appointed administrator invited expressions of interest for the sale of Reliance Capital.

Reliance Industries' subsidiary RSBVL and US-based Sanmina Corporation have completed the deal to set up an electronics manufacturing joint venture at a total enterprise valuation of about Rs 3,300 crore.

Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited (RSBVL) will hold 50.1 per cent equity stake in the joint venture while Sanmina will have 49.9 per cent shareholding.

RSBVL will achieve this ownership primarily through an investment of up to Rs 1,670 crore in new shares in Sanmina's existing Indian entity.

With the investment, the entity will become a joint venture and will be capitalised with over USD 200 million of cash to fund growth.

""Sanmina Corporation, a leading integrated manufacturing solutions company and Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited (RSBVL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), India's largest private sector company, today announced they have completed the previously announced joint venture transaction,"" a joint statement by the two companies said on Tuesday.

RSBVL had a revenue of Rs 1,478.1 crore (USD 194.9 million) and a net profit of Rs 179.8 crore for the year ended March 2022. It had a total investment of Rs 10,857.7 crore at the end of March 2022, the statement said.

The joint venture will leverage Sanmina's 40 years of advanced manufacturing experience and Reliance's expertise and leadership in the Indian business ecosystem. The day-to-day business will continue to be managed by Sanmina's management team in Chennai.

""The joint venture will create a world-class electronic manufacturing hub in India. The joint venture will prioritise high technology infrastructure hardware, for growth markets, and across industries such as communications networking (5G, cloud infrastructure, hyperscale datacentres), medical and healthcare systems, industrial and cleantech, and defence and aerospace,"" the statement said.

In addition to supporting Sanmina's current customer base, the joint venture will create a 'Manufacturing Technology Centre of Excellence' that will serve as an incubation centre to support the product development and hardware start-up ecosystem in India as well as promote research and innovation of leading-edge technologies.

All the manufacturing will take place at Sanmina's 100-acre campus in Chennai, with the ability for site expansion to support future growth opportunities as well as to potentially expand to new manufacturing sites in India over time, based on business needs, the statement said.

Jio, Reliance telecoms unit, has been credited with upending the world's no. 2 mobile market with cheap 4G data plans and free voice services in 2016. Last year, it followed that up with its 4G JioPhone that costs $81.

The laptop, to be called JioBook and which will be embedded with a 4G sim card, will be available to customers such as schools and government institutes from this month while a consumer launch is anticipated within the next three months, the sources said. As with the JioPhone, a 5G-enabled version is set to follow.

""This will be as big as JioPhone,"" one of the sources told Reuters.

The sources declined to be identified as the launch plans have not been made public. Jio, India's biggest telecom carrier with more than 420 million customers, did not respond to a request for comment.

The JioPhone has been India's top-selling smartphone priced under $100, accounting for a fifth of that market segment over the last three quarters, according to Counterpoint Research. The segment accounts for 9% of the country's smartphone sales.

JioBook will run on the JioOS operating system, the sources said, adding that some of Microsoft's apps will also be available. It will use Qualcomm chips based on technology from Arm Ltd, they added.

The laptop will compete with a limited number of offerings in that price range from Acer, Lenovo and Indian firm Lava.

But it could face some resistance in a country where laptops running Microsoft Windows dominate.

""Challenges for the adoption will be user awareness...Also non-Windows (operating system) is a letdown too,"" Counterpoint analyst Tarun Pathak said.

Currently, HP and Dell dominate laptop sales in India - a market of 14 million unit sales annually which could expand another 15% with the addition of JioBook, Pathak estimates.

The JioBook will be produced locally by contract manufacturer Flex with Jio aiming to sell ""hundreds of thousands"" of units by March, one of the sources said.

Jio, which is also pitching the laptop as an alternative to tablets for out-of-office corporate employees, raised around $22 billion from global investors such as KKR & Co Inc and Silver Lake in 2020.

Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani said 5G would help in accelerating India's growth by making the country a 40-trillion dollar economy by 2047, up from $3 trillion today.

Speaking at the inaugural session of the India Mobile Congress on October 1 which saw the launch of 5G services in the country, the billionaire businessman said the next generation of telecom services would help in the dual goals of acceleration of growth and inclusion in the development.

5G would accelerate India's growth and help inclusive development by increasing the per capita income to 20,000 dollars from 2,000 dollars.

""Therefore it will not be an exaggeration to say that 5G is like a digital Kamdhenu, the heavenly cow that grants whatever we desire,"" Ambani said.

The 65-year-old industrialist said Reliance Jio would deliver 5G in every town, taluka and tehsil of the country by December of 2023.

""Most of Jio's 5G is made in India and thus carries the stamp of Atmanirbhar Bharat,"" Ambani said, referring to the government’s push for self-reliance.

""India may have started a little late, yet I want to assure all of you that we will finish first by rolling out 5G services across the length and breadth of India,"" he said.

""As an industry, we will also ensure the highest quality and most affordable rates than anywhere else in the world.”

Tech revolution on the fast track

5G would help in providing quality healthcare to rural areas by turning hospitals into smart hospitals, he said. The next wave of wireless network can also bridge gap between urban and rural India by accelerating digitsation, he said.

""5G can make available powerful tools for small-scale industries and commercial enterprises as are used by large captial intensive businesses,"" Ambani said.

By bringing artificial intelligence into every domain, 5G can ""power India's emergence as the world's intelligence capital"", he said. ""This will make India a major exporter of high value-added digital solutions and services.""

The next wave

The department of telecommunciatons had in August received total bids worth Rs 1.50 lakh crore from the 5G spectrum auction.

Reliance Jio, Adani group, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea were the four major participants in the spectrum sale.

Reliance Jio is betting big on its standalone 5G architecture through which it can deliver new and powerful services such as low latency connectivity, massive machine-to-machine communication, 5G voice, Edge computing and network slicing, and metaverse.

The company earlier said most telecom operators at present were deploying a version of 5G called non-standalone 5G, which is essentially a 5G radio signal delivered over an existing 4G infrastructure.

In terms of speed, the thumb rule for 5G is 100 Mbps, though it may vary. The broad consensus for 4G is that it is in the range of 60-70 Mbps.

The letter was issued to Jio Satellite Communications Ltd (JSCL) on Monday, sources informed. An email sent to Reliance Jio for comments did not fetch a response. The sources, meanwhile, said the Department of Telecom (DoT) has granted Letter of Intent for global mobile personal communication by satellite (GMPCS) services to the company.

With this, the company can set up and operate the GMPCS services in the licensed service areas. The licences are for a period of 20 years (from the date of its grant after fulfilling stipulated conditions). The offering under GMPCS include voice and data services via satellite. These mobile satellite networks can operate with low-earth orbit (LEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO) and Geosynchronous (GEO) satellites.

On February 14 this year, Mukesh Ambani's conglomerate had announced a joint venture to provide satellite-based broadband services across India, joining the race with billionaires Elon Musk's SpaceX and Sunil Mittal's OneWeb to offer reliable, high-speed internet everywhere.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd can explore reorganization of the company into three independent entities for different business verticals as it prepares to list subsidiaries and induct next-generation of the founding family into key roles, a report said.

This, a report by Kotak Institutional Equities, would help prevent any holding company discount in Reliance as and when its subsidiaries list, prepare for eventual management change and preclude inter-linkages between entities as and when they become independent, listed entities.

India’s most valuable company has three distinct businesses — oil refining and petrochemicals business house in oil-to-chemicals (O2C) unit, digital business including telecom and retail.”

Reliance can explore reorganization of the company into three independent entities for its three different business verticals as it prepares to list its subsidiaries and induct next-generation members of the founding family into key roles,” the report said.

Company management and shareholders may consider a reorganisation of the company to achieve three mutually linked objectives of structure, succession and segregation.”One option could be to reorganize Reliance into three independent listed business verticals (communications, energy and retailing).

This would broadly entail shareholders of Reliance eventually becoming shareholders of the retailing and telecommunications entities other than the minority shareholders in those entities. Various smaller entities may be clubbed into one of the appropriate verticals to ensure limited overlaps post the restructuring,” it said.

At the company’s annual shareholders meeting last month, Ambani identified his twin children Akash and Isha for digital and retail respectively and youngest son Anant for energy business.”We note that our hypothetical structure of three independent listed entities instead of four listed entities (Reliance + three listed subsidiaries in communications, energy, retailing) or three listed entities (Reliance + two listed subsidiaries in communications and retailing) will prevent potential large holding company discount for Reliance stock relative to the value of its assets in the parent entity and holdings in various subsidiaries. This has been the fate of several holding-cum-operating and holding companies,” Kotak said.

It was of the opinion that the ‘new’ Reliance would be in a better position to manage the ‘new’ world with rapid changes and disruption as and when the firm enters the next phase of its corporate life under a new top management.”Reliance is an incredibly complex entity and its sheer scale and size of operations across different businesses demonstrates the exceptional management abilities of the founder family over the past few decades.

Nonetheless, growing external challenges (rapid pace of technological change and disruption) and internal complexity (the firm is a massive conglomerate) may require smaller, specialised entities with separate objectives and operations,” it said.The new structure, it said, will provide a cleaner framework for the retailing and telecommunications businesses as and when they were to list.

“Shareholders would presumably prefer limited related-party transactions across various listed entities and some may even prefer ‘cleaner’ structures as a precondition for investment. There is significant overlap between the media, retailing and telecommunications businesses at present,” it added.

The acquisition of the iconic Campa brand could pit the company against Pepsi, and Coca-Cola in the beverages market.

The brands are likely to be relaunched this year.

The news of the acquisition comes days after Isha Ambani, director of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd, announced on August 29 that the retail arm of the company is set to foray into the FMCG segment.

“I am excited to announce that this year, we will launch our fast-moving consumer goods business. The objective of this business is to develop and deliver high quality, affordable products which solve every Indian's daily needs,” said Ambani.

Reliance Retail’s announcement on August 29 that it would enter the packaged consumer goods segment has created buzz in the market.

The retail giant’s entry into the so-called Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector is set to intensify competition as it does in every new industry that its parent, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), enters, experts say.

With the venture, Reliance Retail will be competing with FMCG behemoths like Hindustan Unilever, Nestle and Britannia in an industry valued at over $110 billion.

Even so, the company potentially confronts multiple challenges in its intended venture into FMCG.

“The competition intensifies in every segment that Reliance gets into because of their approach of being aggressive and not just in terms of growth. The company also wants to acquire market share very rapidly. The telecom sector was a prime example of this,” said Devangshu Dutta, CEO of retail consulting firm Third Eyesight.

“However, Reliance’s entry into any consumer-facing business has always been a long play,” he added.

The intended entry of Reliance Retail, the retail arm of RIL, into FMCG was announced by Isha Ambani, director of Reliance Retail Ventures, at RIL’s 45th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on August 29.

“I am excited to announce that this year, we will launch our Fast-Moving Consumer Goods business. The objective of this business is to develop and deliver high-quality, affordable products which solve every Indian's daily needs,” Ambani told shareholders.

Isha Ambani was introduced as the leader of the company’s retail business by Mukesh Ambani, her father and Chairman and MD of RIL, at the AGM.

In his speech, Mukesh Ambani also said that he is hopeful of the retail arm emerging as the largest segment within the group.

(Read: Reliance Retail to become largest segment in RIL family, says Mukesh Ambani)

Private labels

Reliance Retail already has a presence in the FMCG segment in the form of private labels that are sold in the company’s chain stores such as Reliance Smart, Reliance Mart, and its online grocery platform JioMart.

Brands like Good Life, Best Farms, Desi Kitchen, Snac Tac, Yeah!, Safe Lite, Petals, Mothercare and Calcident are some private label FMCG brands that the company sells.

Private labels (including in the fashion and lifestyle segment) contribute 65 percent of the company’s revenue.

According to analysts, the company initially is going to expand its private label offerings and will focus on segments in which it already has a presence.

“The products which it plans to sell range from groceries like pulses and grains, edible oils, flour, dry fruits, spices, pickles, pastes, idli dosa batter, snacks which include biscuits, namkeens and sweets, ready-to-cook meals, ketchup, jams, carbonated drinks, fruit juices, breakfast cereal, oats, muesli, honey, sauces, tea and coffee in the foods space,” said a note by Edelweiss.

In the non-foods space, the company sells products like soaps, shower gels, hand wash, face wash, hair oils, talcum powder, sanitisers, sanitary pads, diapers, toothpaste and toothbrushes, nail enamel, beauty and hair accessories, and daily essentials including deodorants, nail clippers and scissors, the securities firm said.

Edelweiss said it expects Reliance Retail to initially target the commoditised parts of FMCG like pulses and grains, edible oils, flour, dry fruits, spices, pickles, pastes, idli and dosa batter, namkeens, sweets and lower-end detergents.

Potential strategies

Experts indicate that much on the lines of its earlier playbook, Reliance Retail is likely to adopt organic as well as inorganic strategies for growth in the sector.

“Reliance aims to be a dominant player in every segment and, hence, the company, besides organic growth opportunities, is also likely to look out for acquisitions in the space,” said Dutta of Third Eyesight.

Edelweiss also expects Reliance Retail to acquire regional entities and Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) brands and also target unorganised/regional brands in most FMCG segments it enters.

The company, analysts said, will also look at value-play to gain penetration into the categories.

Impact on the competition

According to experts, the move is set to intensify competition in the segment and may have an impact on existing FMCG companies in the near term.

“We don’t expect a big impact on numbers of existing players from a two-three years’ perspective. However, near-term multiples could come under risk for some companies Hindustan Unilever, Britannia, Marico, Adani Wilmar, Godrej Consumer Products, etc. It will not have much impact on Nestle, Colgate, Dabur, ITC,” Edelweiss wrote in its note.

The impact on the industry will depend on the level of aggression Reliance Retail summons in product launches.

Challenges

FMCG is a well-established segment with well-known brands that have a huge distribution network, and cracking the market would be the biggest challenge for Reliance Retail, industry experts suggested.

“It is tough for new players to get shelf space in kirana (grocery stores). Earlier, we have seen some retailers entering the segment but with little success,” Edelweiss said.

“The existing players have decades of loyalty with consumers and relationships with distributors,” it added.

Analysts indicate that even after getting shelf space, new FMCG players have to constantly innovate to stay ahead of the curve.

“A company can offer early-stage incentives, launch offers to retailers to grab the shelf space but then it has to keep reviving that engine constantly, which is not easy,” said Dutta.

Although Reliance Retail has a significant share of modern retail trade through its grocery chains, the company needs to build a multi-tier distribution network, especially in general trade, which commands 80-90 percent of FMCG sales.

With JioAirFiber, it will be easy to connect any home or office to Gigabit-speed Internet, Ambani said during the company’s 45th annual general meeting on Monday.

He said, “With the 5G services being rolled out in India, the current 800 million connected internet devices will double to 1.5 billion connected internet devices in just a year”.

Let's take a look at what JioAirFiber is, how it will work, and whether there are other players in the market offering similar products.

What is AirFiber?

AirFiber works on radio-based solutions and is wireless. AirFiber uses fixed broadband technology to deliver the same high speeds and service as traditional broadband providers but delivered wirelessly as opposed to through buried cables.

AirFiber also has the bandwidth to connect hundreds of homes and offices to ultra-high-speed broadband within a short time period.

How are JioFiber Connection and Jio AirFiber different?

Jio Fiber is a fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) internet broadband service provided by telecom operator Reliance Jio Infocomm was first announced as Jio GigaFiber in 2018 at the Reliance Industries 41st annual general meeting.

The FTTH broadband service promises a speed of up to 1 Gigabit per second. Besides, it would be the core technology enabler behind the GigaTV platform and the company’s products in the internet of things (IoT) ecosystem.

JioAirFiber, on the other hand, offers speed similar to JioFiber broadband connection, however, unlocks engaging experiences, such as interactive live content, cloud gaming, immersive shopping and more. JioAirFiber also has the potential to connect hundreds of homes and offices at the same time.

How does it work?

For any AirFibers, a small antenna is placed on one's building that receives a direct signal from one of Reliance's towers nearby. The connection from one’s location and the tower allows for fast reliable service via a fixed wireless connection. This prevents interrupted data which is common with cellular or wired internet connections.

Jio in fact demonstrated one of AirFiber’s capabilities, where users will be able to watch a live IPL match with multiple camera angles in ultra HD at the same time. Users can also dynamically switch between the camera angles. AirFiber also lets users enjoy multiplayer cloud gaming or host a watch party with their friends, courtesy of its ultra-low latency.

What is JioCloud PC?

Jio has also launched a new JioCloud PC, which is a thin device with a pay-for-what-you-use model. Consumers can get the Jio virtual PC with no upfront investments or upgrades. The company stated that Jio True 5G and its other services will be useful for various industries and sectors, such as agriculture, healthcare and education.

“With no upfront investment or tension of periodical upgrading, a user needs to pay only to the extent used, resulting in a super-affordable way to bring the power of a PC, even multiple PCs, to every Indian home and business,” Ambani said during the launch.

What about other players in the market?

In 2020, Government-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited also introduced AirFiber, Bharat Air Fiber Services through local business partners as part of the Digital India initiatives. BSNL lauched with an aim of providing wireless connectivity in the range of 20KMs from BSNL locations, which will benefit citizens residing in remote areas.

After BSNL, Jio is the only company to have brought the AirFiber features to India.

He highlighted that within a year, the consumption of renewable energy at Reliance has jumped 352 percent.

The push towards new energy was visible as also was the stress on boosting existing capacities in its main businesses. “We will also be establishing 20 GW of solar energy generation capacity by 2025. This will be entirely consumed for our captive needs of round-the-clock (RTC) power and intermittent energy for Green Hydrogen. Once proven at scale, we are prepared to double the investment to scale up our manufacturing ecosystem,” he said.

The company will set up a new Giga factory for power electronics. “We are building significant capabilities in design and manufacturing of power electronics and software systems, integrating with our capabilities of Telecommunications, Cloud Computing and IoT platform” Ambani said in his address.

All these are steps towards the company reducing its net carbon footprint to zero by 2035.

Its digital and retail businesses that have grabbed investors’ attention the most: Jio and Reliance Retail, too will have enough dough to spend and expand. The conglomerate’s retail enterprise will launch its fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), the management announces at the AGM.

Its telecom and digital services firm Jio will focus on rolling out 5G services across the country. “Using 5G technology, we can dramatically reduce latency or lag, and deliver breakthrough increases in broadband speed, network capacity, and the number of connected users,” he said.

Unlike other operators that are planning to deploy 5G signal over existing 4G network, Jio will roll out Stand-Alone 5G which does not depend on the existing network infrastructure. “With Stand-Alone 5G, Jio can deliver new and powerful services such as low latency connectivity, massive machine-to-machine communication, 5G voice, Edge computing and network slicing, and metaverse,” he said.

This is in addition to the mid-band spectrum of 3500 MHz is earmarked for 5G globally for all players. The company is working globally with mobile phone makers to support its 5G rollout, Ambani said.

The auction that stretched into seven days ended this afternoon, the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The provisional figure for the sale proceeds is Rs 1,50,173 crore and the final numbers are being tallied, they added.

The auction of spectrum that supports 5G services in India started on July 26, with about 72,000 MHz under nine bands up for sale with a validity period of 20 years.

The response on Day 1 of the auction shows that the telecom industry has ""turned the tide and is now growing into a sunrise industry"", Vaishnaw said. ""It will focus on investment and providing better quality of service,"" CNBC TV18 quoted him as saying.

Four rounds of auction were completed today, the minister noted, adding that ""strong bids"" were received from the applicants. Four bidders were in the fray — Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Adani Data.

On July 27, on day one of the 5G spectrum auction, the 700MHz (megahertz) band, which no one had bid for in the previous two spectrum auctions in 2016 and 2021, suddenly rose to become the belle of the ball. In this auction, 40% of this band was bid for Rs 39,300 crore.

Seven new rounds of bidding held on the sixth day of auction on Sunday 'dialled in' an incremental Rs 163 crore, propelling the cumulative spectrum sale beyond the Rs 1.50 lakh crore-mark.

The auction has fetched provisional bids worth Rs 1,50,130 crore in the first six days, according to data released by the telecom department. Sources said that after a relative easing of demand on Saturday, the UP East circle – which includes Lucknow, Allahabad, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Kanpur – saw bidding activity pick-up once again for 1800 MHz, a band primarily used by telcos for 4G services.

UP East – which has over 10 crore mobile subscribers – accounted for all the incremental spectrum sales on Sunday, amid a pitched battle for radio waves among players such as Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. As on May, Reliance Jio had 3.29 mobile subscribers in UP East, Bharti Airtel (3.7 crore) and Vodafone Idea (2.02 crore).

The bidding intensity for 1800 MHz band in Uttar Pradesh East circle had peaked between Wednesday and Friday, then subsided somewhat on Saturday. On Sunday, however, renewed interest was seen and demand flared once again outstripping the spectrum supply, sources said. All the three private operators are said to be keen on topping up their holdings in this band in UP East, as radiowaves in 900 MHz band are not available.

All eyes will be on this circle when bidding resumes on Monday with 38th round, and the auction timelines would depend on how the bidding progresses through the day. Telecom Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had earlier said the 5G auction underscored that industry wants to expand, and had entered a growth phase.

""The auction results are very good, close to Rs 1,49,966 crore has been committed by the industry for buying the spectrum,"" Vaishnaw had said at a briefing on Saturday. The reserve price fixed for spectrum is a ""fair number"" and the same is visible from the auction outcome, the minister had asserted.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio, Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and a unit of billionaire Gautam Adani’s flagship Adani Enterprises are in the race to bid for the 5G spectrum, which offers speeds about 10 times faster than 4G, lag-free connectivity and can enable billions of connected devices to share data in real-time. Besides powering ultra-low latency connections, which allow downloading full-length high-quality video or movie to a mobile device in a matter of seconds (even in crowded areas), the Fifth Generation or 5G would enable solutions such as e-health, connected vehicles, more-immersive augmented reality and metaverse experiences, life-saving use cases, and advanced mobile cloud gaming, among others.

Up until Friday, about 71 per cent of the total spectrum put on the block had been provisionally sold. After a flying start on Tuesday that saw players pouring in Rs 1.45 lakh crore on the first day, the numbers have inched up incrementally since Wednesday, with players such as Jio and Airtel locked in intense bidding in Uttar Pradesh East circle for 1800 MHz band.

In all, 72 GHz (gigahertz) of radiowaves worth at least Rs 4.3 lakh crore is on the block in the 2022 auction. The auction is being held for spectrum in various low (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz), mid (3300 MHz) and high (26 GHz) frequency bands.",598,0.963795828819275

Incrementally, Rs 111-112 crore came in on July 30, the provisional proceeds rising from the Rs 1,49,855 crore received till Friday from players like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. Industry analysts citing the telecom ministry data said that the demand in Uttar Pradesh East – which had peaked over the last three days – fell below supply levels on July 30.

Earlier, the demand was for 75 blocks against the supply of 54 blocks, experts said, adding in the just-concluded round the demand was for 50 blocks, four less than the supply in the circle. The demand-supply pattern in Uttar Pradesh East indicated that the bidding activity may be showing signs of winding down, although the situation will be clearer on July 31 morning.

Seven fresh rounds were conducted on July 30, and the bidding will resume on July 31 (a departure from the usual practice) with the 31st round. Till July 29, about 71 per cent of the total spectrum put on the block had been provisionally sold.

The conglomerate, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, expects the price cap for its KG-D6 gas sales to rise over the current USD 9.92 per million British thermal units, Sanjay Roy, senior vice-president for exploration and production, said in an investor call following the announcement of the firm's quarterly earnings on Friday.

After remaining a loss-making provision for several quarters, Reliance's gas exploration business has begun reaping rewards of a global surge in energy prices that have already pushed the rates to a record high.

The government sets gas prices every six months based on international rates.

The price of gas from old or regulated fields was more than doubled to a record USD 6.1 per mmBtu from April 1, and that for difficult fields like those lying in deepsea to USD 9.92 per mmBtu.

Rates are due for a revision in October. It is anticipated that the price of gas from old fields of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will be hiked to about USD 9 per mmBtu and the cap for difficult fields will rise to double digits.

Reliance produced about 19 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from its newer fields in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block in the April-June quarter. KG-D6 block lies in deepsea and so gets a price equivalent to that for difficult fields.

""Price ceiling for KGD6 (R-Cluster/Sats) revised to USD 9.92 per mmBtu for H1FY23 (April-September 2022) which is expected to rise further for H2FY23 (October 2022 to March 2023),"" Roy said.

But this rate remains disconnected with global prices.

""We do see that the domestic price ceiling remains disconnected, whether the prices are elevated or when prices fall. And you know we are continuing our advocacy for removal of ceiling prices. Overall, we expect higher gas price realizations in FY23 and in the quarters to come,"" he said.

Reliance got a price of USD 22.48 per mmBtu for 0.7 mmscmd of gas it produces from coal seams (CBM) from blocks in Madhya Pradesh. There is no cap on CBM gas price.

Higher gas prices propelled a 80.5 per cent rise in revenue from the business to Rs 3,625 crore during April-June and a 76 per cent jump in EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) to Rs 2,737 crore.

Roy said the company is expecting the MJ field in the KG-D6 block to be on stream by the third quarter of this fiscal year, which will help take the output from the block to about 30 mmscmd.

""Overall, the outlook is, once the MJ field is commissioned, we should be progressively moving towards delivering more than a billion cubic feet per day (30 mmscmd) by FY24 (April 2023 to March 2024),"" he said.

On the elevated global gas prices, he said the shift in European demand from Russian gas to LNG and some supply destruction are driving prices. Current prices of benchmark JKM are ruling at about USD 38 per mmBtu.

""So, prices continue to remain elevated and are expected to, given the challenges that are there today,"" he said.

The Indian gas market outlook, he said, remains robust, with the availability of domestic gas being one of the reasons.

""Because domestic gas particularly like in KG-D6, where there is a price ceiling and that is much in demand as compared to the market prices that are currently prevailing at these times,"" he said.

He further noted, ""Now, in terms of price ceiling, as you all are aware and I mentioned earlier, the price must move up and we will see higher realizations. It is expected that, based on higher energy prices, this will go further up.""

Reliance and its partner bp plc of UK produce about 19 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) of gas from two sets of new fields in the deepsea block KG-D6.

Reliance-bp is currently producing about 20 per cent of India's total domestic production and MJ would help increase this to up to 30 per cent.

The government on July 20 scrapped a windfall tax on the export of petrol and cut the levy on overseas shipments of diesel and ATF as well as on domestically produced crude oil following a decline in global oil prices.

While the Rs 6 a litre export duty on petrol was scrapped, the tax on the export of diesel and jet fuel (ATF) was cut by Rs 2 per litre each to Rs 11 and Rs 4 respectively, government notifications showed. The tax on domestically produced crude was also cut to Rs 17,000 per tonne from Rs 23,250, a move that will benefit state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Vedanta Ltd.

Also, correcting the anomaly that crept in when the windfall taxes were slapped on July 1, the government exempted fuel exports from refineries located in export-focused zones from the levies. The move will benefit Reliance Industries whose exports had become uncompetitive due to the export levies that were as high as USD 26 per barrel.

Reliance shares closed 2.47 per cent higher at Rs 2,501.40 a piece on the BSE. the stock of ONGC rose 4 per cent to Rs 132.55, while Vedanta stock closed 6.22 per cent higher at Rs 253.45 a piece. India imposed windfall taxes on July 1, joining a growing number of nations that taxes super normal profits of energy companies. But international oil prices have cooled since then, eroding profit margins at both oil producers and refiners. India imposed windfall taxes on July 1, joining a growing number of nations that taxes super normal profits of energy companies.

International crude prices slumped on concerns of a potential global recession, which was mirrored in cracks or margins on diesel, petrol and ATF falling. The July 1 export duties of Rs 6 per litre on petrol and ATF translated into USD 12 per barrel, while Rs 13 a litre tax on diesel was equivalent to USD 26 a barrel. The Rs 23,250 per tonne windfall tax on domestic crude production equalled USD 40 per barrel.

The realised spread on petrol after considering the tax was near a loss-making level of just USD 2 per barrel, while the diesel spread too was a meagre sum. For oil producers, the windfall levy, which was separate from the royalty and cess they continue to pay, took away 40 per cent of their earnings. This as, petrol cracks have dipped to USD 10 per barrel in July from USD 34.6 in June (currently below USD 3 per barrel), diesel cracks fell to USD 34.9 from USD 48.9 per barrel and Jet/kero cracks declined to USD 28 per barrel from USD 41.6.

The cut in windfall tax will benefit Reliance, which operates two oil refineries at Jamnagar, in Gujarat with one focused only on exports. 55 per cent of its refining production comes from its export refinery. ""We estimate the gross refining margin (GRM) impact for Reliance could now decline to USD 1 per barrel vs a potential USD 9-10 per barrel impact earlier,"" Citi said. The reduced tax now translates into USD 29 per barrel for crude oil producers and USD 22 a barrel on diesel and USD 8 on aviation fuel (ATF).

At the time of imposing the windfall tax, the government had stated that the objective behind the move was to shore up domestic supplies as refiners were preferring to export than to meet the local requirements. But an export levy on only-for-export refineries did not make sense as those units aren’t meant to supply fuel to the domestic market. And that anomaly has now been corrected. ""This will also ensure that the government’s export-friendly image is not hurt,"" CLSA said.

State-owned ONGC and Oil India Ltd as well as private sector Vedanta Ltd, who account for almost all the crude oil produced in the country, will benefit from the cut in windfall tax. The USD 11 per barrel cut in windfall tax reflects the Government’s approach to limit net oil realization for upstream industry at around USD 75 per barrel. ""We expect the duty structure to remain dynamic and move along with the crude oil prices,"" brokerage Haitong said.

Besides Reliance, Russia’s Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy, which operates a 20 million tonnes a year refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat, will also benefit from the cut in the export levy. When the taxes were introduced, it was estimated that they would bring over Rs 1 lakh crore additional revenue in the full year.

The windfall tax on crude production alone was estimated to generate revenue of Rs 65,600 crore and tax on export products another Rs 52,700 crore if they were to be continued for the full year. The reduction in tax rates will change these calculations. Prashant Vasisht, Vice President and Co-Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited, said the tax on domestically produced crude oil remains quite steep and is likely to adversely impact the EBITDA of the Indian upstream industry by about Rs 39,000 crore for FY2023.

The export duty on diesel and ATF, though reduced, remains negative for the non-SEZ situated exporters of these products and would adversely impact the realisations on export sales, he said. ""The impact on the overall GRMs of exporters is expected to be in the range of USD 1 per barrel to USD 3 a barrel depending on their proportion of exports and the EBITDA impact on the downstream industry is expected to be Rs 22,000 crore for FY2023,"" he said.",913,-0.23169862031936644

Impulsive decision-making isn’t something that one associates with Mukesh Ambani. Asia’s richest man, who’s built Reliance into one of the most enduring success stories in the world of business, didn’t get here by relying on hunches and intuition. Even his most audacious bets — on retail in 2006 and telecom 10 years later — came on the back of extensive research, market mapping, and hours of confabulations with experts in the business.

It is safe to assume then that the current succession plan underway in the group has been soused and marinated for years before being put into motion with Akash Ambani, the elder of the twins by minutes, being named as chairman of Reliance Jio Infocomm after being on its board since 2014.

Mukesh Ambani, still only 65, made a clear declaration of intent in December 2021, when on the occasion of Reliance Family Day marking the birth anniversary of group founder Dhirubhai Ambani, he articulated the coming leadership change: “All seniors — myself included — should now yield to the highly competent, extremely committed and incredibly promising young leadership talent at Reliance.”

The first piece in the elaborate exercise came in 2020 when in the midst of a raging pandemic, the group cemented deals to sell stakes in both Jio and the retail business to companies like Meta and Google as well as sovereign and private equity funds like the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia and General Atlantic.

Both businesses are also scheduled to be listed sometime in the next few years, allowing the group to unlock further value. The cash will be needed for its next big plan, the entry into green energy and its debt-free status would give it the cushion of being able to raise funds when needed. Succession planning in a highly leveraged group, laden with debt, can be very very tricky as the experience of many other Indian business families suggests.

Against a backdrop of financial stability, Ambani’s succession plan went into place keeping two key tenets in mind. For a harmonious transition there had to be an equitable distribution of the business empire among the three children, Akash, Isha, and Anant. This isn’t just a matter of the value of the business today but its future opportunities for growth and returns. Since the conglomerate spans businesses at different points of the business cycle, that’s probably the most challenging part.

If eventually, Akash heads telecom, Isha retail, and Anant the energy business including the mature fossil fuel refining and exploration as well as the proposed diversification into new energy, each of the next-gen Ambanis will have a smorgasbord of options that should keep them interested for the next few decades.

But while doing so, the next generation of Ambanis will need the support of professionals to manage their inheritances. Mukesh Ambani learnt at the feet of his father, a master strategist. But many of his early lessons also came from working closely with seasoned professionals like PMS Prasad, particularly during the setting up of Reliance's Jamnagar Refinery complex in 1999.

In scale and spread, the group’s three broad business areas — telecom, retail, and energy — are much too vast and complex for any one person to be able to manage on their own. Akash, Isha and Anant are 30, 30, and 27 respectively and for all their exposure to the business over the last few years, they require more experience to manage a rapidly changing environment while competing with large, well-funded, Indian and multinational competitors.

In retail, for instance, Reliance is up against formidable adversaries like Dmart, Amazon and Flipkart but also newly emerging rivals like Nykaa. This is why, the Reliance Jio Infocomm board while approving Akash Ambani as chairman, also simultaneously cleared the appointment of Pankaj Mohan Pawar as Managing Director of the company for five years. The 48-year-old Pawar has been a director in various group companies for the last 12 years, including Reliance Retail whose board he joined in 2010.

The emerging structure bears some resemblance to the one that exists in WalMart. Since references have been made to the US retailer in connection with the Ambani succession plan, it is instructive to consider how the iconic US retailer’s founder Sam Walton set up his successors. More so because Walton’s plan has worked very well with WalMart managing to retain its preeminent position in America’s retail landscape even 30 years after his death in 1992.

Walton, who was 74 at that time, had been planning for his succession since 1988 when he was diagnosed with an incurable form of cancer. As part of the exercise, he promoted David D. Glass to the president and chief executive. Glass worked under Walton’s watchful eye till he was alive and continued in the job for the next 12 years while Rob Walton, Sam’s oldest son became chairman.

The arrangement worked perfectly as Walmart soon overtook Sears Roebuck & Co. and Kmart to become America’s largest retail chain. In 2015, Greg Penner, Rob Walton’s son-in-law who had been a company director since 2008, took over him as the company’s third chairman.

Over the last 30 years, the Walton family has exercised control through its roughly 51 percent of the voting power in Wal-Mart Stores. The vehicle of control is the private holding company Walton Enterprises which owns approximately 35 percent of the total shares and the Walton Family Holdings Trust which holds another 15 percent of the shares.

Something similar could play out at Reliance though it will be a while before it is completely in place. As it is, Reliance is a conglomerate and for successful succession, it needs to be desegregated into clearly identifiable and manageable companies.

Eventually, though, an egalitarian distribution of the business interests along with support from professional managers who are also Reliance loyalists is the bedrock on which Ambani’s generational transition will be built. It will comprise elements taken from similar transitions elsewhere but will also strive to avoid the kind of pitfalls that Mukesh Ambani himself had to overcome. But by kickstarting the process, Ambani may have shown the way to many other Indian business families looking at similar succession issues.

Industry body Broadband India Forum on Tuesday termed telcos’ arguments on a level playing field between public and captive private 5G networks as ”absurd and impractical”, and asserted that the two are separate sets of services on a completely different footing and not competing with each other. The age-old and time-tested concept of ’level playing field’ cannot apply in the case of captive private 5G networks, as they have several distinctive traits, which distinguish them from public networks, with whom they are being compared ”without any logic or basis”, Broadband India Forum (BIF) said in a statement.

”Seeking a level playing field with enterprises for captive private networks is akin to a child in kindergarten being asked to compete with someone who has a doctoral degree,” BIF President, TV Ramachandran pointed out. The suggestion that private networks should not be given spectrum in bands, which are possible for telcos to use for offering services is ”unjustified”, as the telcos’ businesses depend on economies of scale, while that of enterprise businesses having private networks does not, BIF said.

Regulations, Ramachandran said, are applied to mature players in the competition, who have significant market share and can abuse it. ”No mature regulator anywhere in the world imposes regulation on a player with no or minimal market share,” Ramachandran said. ”

The telecom players on Monday flagged their concerns over the decision on private captive networks, during the pre-bid conference held by the Department of Telecom (DoT). Industry association COAI – whose members include Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea – wrote to the DoT recently expressing disappointment at the government’s decision on captive private networks.

Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has demanded a level playing field, arguing that solution providers too should pay the license fee and GST at the rates applicable for telcos on the billed amount of revenue and that such captive networks must remain ”truly” private and isolated, and adhere to security norms. It has been argued that since a decision to enable the captive networks through direct spectrum assignment has been taken, the government must now restrict the scope of such non-public networks to machine-to-machine communication inside the specific premise and plant automation only. Such networks must ensure they do not cause any interference to public networks.

Last week, the Cabinet approved the auction of airwaves capable of offering fifth-generation or 5G telecom services, including ultra-high-speed internet, and gave its nod for setting up captive 5G networks by tech firms. While the 5G spectrum in nine frequency bands will be auctioned to telecom operators like Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio, enterprises and tech firms for the time being will be allowed to take the 5G spectrum for their captive non-public network on lease from the telecom companies.

After winning these rights, Viacom18 will make IPL available to every Indian in every part of India, including the 60 million FreeDish homes which today are not able to access this popular content, the company said in a statement.

“Our mission is to take the joyful experience of IPL to cricket fans wherever they are - in every part of our country and around the world,” said Nita Ambani, Director, Reliance Industries Ltd.

Viacom18 is a joint venture of Reliance Industries-owned Network18, through its subsidiary TV18, and Paramount Global. It recently entered into a strategic partnership transaction with Bodhi Tree Systems (a platform of Lupa Systems of James Murdoch and Uday Shankar).

“Cricket and IPL personify the best of sport and the best of India, which is why we are proud to be deepening our association with this great game and this wonderful league,” said Ambani.

Viacom18 paid Rs 50 crore per match for the Indian subcontinent streaming rights, Rs 33.24 crore for the Indian subcontinent special rights package, and Rs 1.45 crore for international rights in some regions. These include cricket-loving nations such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK. The digital rights for the subcontinent at Rs 23,758 crore have surpassed the TV rights acquired by Star for Rs 23,575 crore.

The IPL rights mark Viacom18’s first major entry into cricket. This, along with the rights of other events such as the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, National Basketball Association (NBA), La Liga, Ligue 1, Serie A, Abu Dhabi T10, and top ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) and Badminton World Federation (BWF), makes Viacom18 and its platforms one of the largest sporting destinations in the country.

What’s more, Viacom has state-of-the-art digital expertise to provide the best possible user experience to hundreds of millions of Indian and global consumers. The digital platforms utilise a combination of top-class content as well as digital prowess through big data analytics and predictive algorithms to offer contextualised and relevant content to each consumer, the company said in a statement.

This also provides an exceptional opportunity for advertisers to reach a larger, younger, more relevant and highly-engaged audience. The targeting opportunities because of Viacom18’s strategic partnership with Jio, which has brought about a mobile data revolution in India, will be unparalleled.

""The Jio DNA in Reliance gives them the foresight and the conviction to stay with very long-tail customer acquisition strategies,"" said Utkarsh Sinha, Managing Director, Bexley advisors a boutique investment bank firm.

Streaming viewership for IPL has been growing with the league registering 421 million viewers last year as compared to 375 million and 325 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively.

The league's digital viewership is expected to see the highest growth with analysts estimating it to touch 523 million in 2023.

High Court judge Ross Cranston on June 9, 2022 ruled that the government should have brought its objections over the arbitration tribunal not meeting the required thresholds, when issuing the 2021 award earlier, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.

Rejecting the government’s arguments, the court said the objections are barred by an English law principle whereby a party cannot raise matters in new proceedings that could have been raised in earlier proceedings.

While an email sent to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas for comments remained unanswered, officials said the government will study the court order and look for appropriate forums for remedy.

It also upheld that the cost recovery in the contract is fixed at USD 545 million in Tapti gas field and USD 577.5 million in Panna-Mukta oil and gas field.

The country's top three private telecom operators will resort to another round of tariff hike in the second half of the current fiscal and will close FY23 with a revenue growth of 20-25 per cent, a report said on Tuesday. A growth in average revenue per user is essential for the industry to invest in the network and spectrum, and if they do not do so, it can result in poor service offerings, domestic rating agency Crisil's research wing said in a report.

After years of intense competition following the entry of the deep-pocketed Reliance Jio, the industry had started hiking tariffs from December 2019. ""…revenue of the top three players is expected to grow a robust 20-25 per cent this fiscal,"" the note said, adding that the operating profit margin will expand by 1.80-2.20 per cent during the fiscal.

It said after a slow 5 per cent growth in the ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) in FY22, the crucial number is set to grow by 15-20 per cent in FY23 as the full impact of the hikes carried out in the previous fiscal plays out, and also on the back of the newer hikes which are expected in the second half of the current fiscal. Since players are expected to spend incrementally on network and regulatory capex in FY23, ARPU growth and tariff hikes could ease some pressure on their books, it said.

In the fiscal gone by, there was a fall in the overall number of subscribers as 3.70 crore inactive users were weeded out, the report said, adding that the active subscribers rose during the year. The three top telcos witnessed a 3 per cent rise in the number of active users by adding 2.90 crore subscribers to the tally, it said.

Reliance Jio saw its total subscriber base fall sharply between August 2021 and February 2022. However, the share of its active subscribers reached 94 per cent in March 2022, compared with 78 per cent in the first quarter of last fiscal, it said, adding that Bharti Airtel added 1.10 crore active subscribers during the fiscal year to take its share of active users to 99 per cent. For Vodafone Idea, it was a ""mixed bag"" during FY23 as the company lost 3 crore active subscribers because of low capex in 4G and ""deterioration of services"", the rating agency said.",396,0.19578617811203003

In a strongly-worded letter to Amazon, the independent directors of Future Retail Ltd (FRL), have rebuked the e-commerce major for preaching governance.

“It is not for a company like yours to preach governance to us. This is akin to ‘a demon preaching vedas’. We, as independent directors of FRL, know our duties and have acted and will continue to act in the discharge of our duties,” said a letter from the independent directors dated May 28.

Amazon on May 19 had written a letter addressed to the independent directors of FRL alleging that the inaction of the directors helped the company in executing a stratagem and transfer of stores to Reliance. In April, Reliance had taken over 835 retail stores of Future Retail.

“Your inaction and material omissions have resulted in the execution of this stratagem orchestrated to commit a fraud by FRL, its promoters, directors and KMPs on various stakeholders inter alia constitutional courts, regulators, lender banks and its shareholders in collusion and connivance with the MDA Group,” said Amazon in its letter.

The independent directors FRL in a reply to Amazon’s recent letter accused the company of “wrecking all the prospects of revival of FRL” and causing the downfall of the company.

“Amazon is neither a shareholder nor a creditor of FRL. On the contrary, it has been responsible for the present state of affairs in FRL. Having wrecked all prospects of revival of FRL, it is remarkable that Amazon has written a letter like this. You have no locus, whatsoever, to address any letter to us,” said the letter addressed to Amazon.

The independent director in their reply also said that Amazon’s allegations are baseless.

“It is unfortunate that Amazon is attempting to pursue the same frivolous and untenable allegations before different fora and is issuing defamatory and scurrilous public statements in this regard even while these matters are presently sub judice before the High Court of Delhi in proceedings initiated by Amazon itself,” the directors said.

According to the independent directors, Amazon’s action made the landlords apprehensive of the prospect of recovering their pending dues, because of which they started terminating the leases of the store premises from December 2020/January 2021 and asked FRL to vacate the premises.

The letter further added that the landlords are free to deal with their properties as they considered fit and they leased these store premises to Reliance. “FRL could not have prevented the lease of store premises by these individual landlords to Reliance,” it added.

Amazon and Future Retail have been embroiled in legal battles since 2020 after Future Group sold its retail assets to Reliance in an attempt to revive the debt-ridden company. Amazon had then objected to the deal and moved to Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) and sought a stay on the deal. Amazon’s objection to the Reliance-Future deal dates back to 2018 when it had bought a 49 percent stake in unlisted Future Coupons Private Limited. According to the company, one of the clauses in the agreement entitled it to pick up a stake in Future Retail at a later date. ​After years of legal tussle, Reliance called off the deal in April after secured creditors rejected the plan.

India's biggest retailer Reliance will acquire dozens of small grocery and non-food brands as it targets building its own $6.5 billion consumer goods business to challenge foreign giants like Unilever, two sources familiar with the plan told Reuters.

Reliance, run by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, plans to build a portfolio of 50 to 60 grocery, household and personal care brands within six months and is hiring an army of distributors to take them to mom-and-pop stores and bigger retail outlets across the nation, the sources added.

The consumer goods push under a vertical named Reliance Retail Consumer Brands will come on top of Ambani's brick-and-mortar store network of more than 2,000 grocery outlets and ongoing expansion of ""JioMart"" e-commerce operations in India's nearly $900 billion retail market, one of world's biggest.

Reliance is in final stages of negotiations with around 30 popular niche local consumer brands to fully acquire them or form joint venture partnerships for sales, said the first source familiar with its business planning.

The total investment outlay planned by the company to acquire brands isn't clear, but the second source said Reliance had set a goal to achieve 500 billion rupees ($6.5 billion) of annual sales from the business within five years.

""Reliance will become a house of brands. This is an inorganic play,"" said the person.

Reliance did not respond to a request for comment.

With the new business plan, Reliance is seeking to challenge some of the world's biggest consumer groups, like Nestle (NESN.S), Unilever (ULVR.L), PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O) and Coca-Cola (KO.N), which have been operating for decades in India, the sources said.

It's a daunting task, though, to beat such well-established foreign companies that have their own manufacturing units in India and thousands of distributors who take their world-famous products like Pond's creams or Maggi noodles across the vast nation of 1.4 billion people.

Unilever's India unit reported sales of $6.5 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2022, and says that nine out of 10 Indian households use at least one of its brands.

""There is a fair bit of brand value which is attached to the established names and it becomes very difficult to compete with them,"" said Alok Shah, a consumer analyst at India's Ambit Capital.

""If inorganic is the route for Reliance, they will be able to scale up much faster. But they'll need to get the pricing and distribution right to compete with bigger rivals.""

HIRING, PRODUCT CATEGORIES

As a retail leader, Reliance still garners most consumer goods revenues by selling or distributing products of other rivals at its own supermarkets and mom-and-pop outlet partners.

Reliance did develop a few so-called private labels where it hired contract manufacturers to make cola drinks and noodle packs for sale in its own retail network, but that business generates only 35 billion rupees ($450 million) in annual sales, said the second source.

Foreign firms had been already uneasy about Reliance's supermarket strategy, where its private labels were competing for shelf space with brands of global rivals, Reuters reported last year.

Reliance's new consumer goods push targets deals with popular Indian brands.

Among the brands it is in talks with for acquisition or potential joint venture, according to one of the sources, is Sosyo, a soft-drink brand of a near 100-year old Indian company, Hajoori, based in the western state of Gujarat and popular for its flavoured drinks.

The company's director, Aliasgar Abbas Hajoori, said in a statement, ""We don't comment on speculations.""

LinkedIn profiles reveal how Reliance has been slowly ramping up efforts to expand its consumer business. In recent weeks, it has hired senior executives from companies like Danone and Kellogg Co for quality control and sales.

One LinkedIn job ad by Reliance stated it had short-listed staples, personal care, beverages, and chocolates as categories for initial launches, and was hiring mid-level sales managers for the business in more than 100 cities and small towns.

Ashni Biyani, daughter of Future Group promoter Kishore Biyani, has resigned as the managing director of Future Consumer Limited citing personal reasons, the company informed in a filing to the stock exchange on May 12. The company also announced the appointment of Samson Samuel as the new CEO of the company, effective from May 12.

Ashni Biyani resigned “...as managing director of the company with effect from closure of business hours on 12th May, 2022. Consequent to the same, she has also ceased to be a 'key managerial personnel' of the company,” the company said in its filing.

“Ashni Biyani has informed the company that she has resigned so due to her personal constraints and challenges due to which she is unable to dedicate necessary time and attention on the affairs of the Company. She shall continue to provide her support to the management and the Company as may be required,” it added.

Biyani will continue to serve on the FCEL board as non-executive director, the filing added.

Ashni Biyani’s resignation comes close on the heels of Rakesh Biyani’s departure from Future Retail as its managing director. Rakesh Biyani is a cousin of Kishore Biyani.

Future Consumer is a subsidiary of Future Group, which has been embroiled in legal battles with Amazon over the sale of Future Retail to Reliance Industries. In a setback to the Future Group last month, Reliance called off its takeover of Future Retail. Even as Amazon and Future Retail are engaged in litigations, the lenders have started insolvency proceedings against the latter.

Of late, reports have surfaced that Kishore Biyani plans to sell key assets and restructure debt to pay off his debts as Future Retail faces bankruptcy proceedings.

Future Consumer, the FMCG arm of Future Group, houses brands such as Golden Harvest, Tasty Treat, CleanMate, Kara etc.

The new CEO of the company, Samson Samuel, said he is ""well aware of challenges ahead to restore profitable growth & alleviate debt by selling certain non-strategic assets,"" according to the filing.

Samson Samuel, is an engineer with around 24 years of experience spanning across manufacturing, consulting, IT and supply chain industries. He has worked in India and US in various capacities with organisations like BestBuy, Staples, Lowes, Future Group, Mafatlal Consultancy, Wipro & Cognizant.

“He has been recently associated with Future Consumer Limited to look after the overall business affairs of its subsidiary operating under the format 'Nilgiris’,” the company said.

Reliance Industries Ltd expects prices of natural gas in India to rise again in October as its gas exploration business reaps the rewards of a global surge in energy prices that have already pushed the rates to a record high. The conglomerate, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, expects the price cap for its KG-D6 gas sales to rise over the current $9.92 per million British thermal units, Sanjay Roy, senior vice-president for exploration and production, said in an investor call following the announcement of its quarterly earnings on Friday.

The government sets gas prices every six months based on international rates. The price of gas from old or regulated fields was more than doubled to a record $6.1 per mmBtu from April 1 and that for difficult fields like those lying in deepsea to $9.92. per mmBtu. Rates are due for a revision in October. It is anticipated that the price of gas from old fields of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will be hiked to about $9 per mmBtu and the cap for difficult fields will rise to double digits.

""In fact, we have also seen prices rise, as we know the gas markets are quite tight and prices have been elevated, and that effect we are seeing now in the revenues as well as improved EBITDA margins,"" Roy said. ""Now, going forward, we expect ceiling prices to increase to $9.92 in the first half (of current fiscal that began on April 1) – that has been notified. And further, we expect increases going from there onwards in the second half of the year.""

Reliance and its partner bp plc of UK produce about 18 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from two sets of new fields in the eastern offshore deepsea block KG-D6. Higher gas prices have helped the company's EBITDA (pre-tax profit) from oil and gas exploration and production business to climb to a seven-year high. Revenue from the segment rose 3.5 times to Rs 7,492 crore in 2021-22 (April 2021 to March 2022) fiscal while EBITDA surged 21 fold to Rs 5,457 crore.

""So, the MJ field is very much on track,"" Roy said. ""We have now drilled all the wells and we expect to undertake the lower and upper completions over the next few months. The FPSO is on track. It is coming together, and we expect that to converge with the completion of the wells towards the end of this year."" Despite challenging circumstances because of the weather window, the company ""expects to bring this field on stream by the end of year,"" he said, adding the firm is also carrying out exploration activities in block KG-DW1, which is contiguous to KG-D6.

On price hike effected from April 1, Morgan Stanley had last month stated that state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is likely to see a $3 billion (about Rs 23,000 crore) rise in its annual earnings from the more than doubling of the price of natural gas it produces, while Reliance may get $1.5 billion (Rs 11,500 crore) more in revenue. Gas accounts for 58 percent of domestic gas production for ONGC and every $1 per mmBtu change in gas price affects ONGC's earnings by five to eight percent.

Morgan Stanley predicted a further hike of 25 percent in the next revision scheduled for October 2022 as tight supplies keep four global benchmark prices at elevated levels. India fixes domestic gas rates based on a formula using prices in the previous 12 months at global gas hubs NBP, Henry Hub, Alberta, and Russia Gas.

On global gas markets, Roy said the tightness has been exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. ""Now in Europe as they try to diversify their source from Russian supplies, there seems to be quite a bit of competition with the Asian consumption. Europe itself consumes about 85 million tons per annum, which is 1% of global supplies. So, you know, a bit them moving away from Russian supplies there's going to be tightness particularly because there's no additional capacity coming on stream until at least 2026 or so.""

""So, we expect this tightness to continue, prices to be elevated. And in India. We have seen a slight pullback because of the high prices. But KG-D6, which has the price ceiling, will be quite attractive because of the lower prices compared to the market prices,"" he said. ""So, demand remains quite strong. That is the overview, essentially, the forward outlook is the sustained production and increased production based on KG-D6 field as well as prices will drive value for the business.""

Reliance-bp, he said, are currently producing about 20% of India's total domestic production and MJ would help increase this to up to 30%.

(Representative image. Source: Reuters)

Creditors of debt-laden Future Group are considering clubbing all group companies under the bankruptcy process after Reliance Industries Ltd called off a deal to acquire the Kishore Biyani-backed company’s retail, logistics, and warehouse assets.

Multiple bankers and legal experts told Moneycontrol on Monday that a group insolvency process could be the best way forward for banks to maximise debt recovery.

Group companies to which banks have exposure include Future Consumer Ltd, Future Retail Ltd and Future Enterprises Ltd.

Lenders to the group include Bank of India, Union Bank of India, State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, and IDBI Bank, among others. These lenders have, together, lent more than Rs 28,000 crore to the group as of January 31, according to the data sourced by Moneycontrol from banks.

Bank of India on April 14 filed insolvency proceedings against Future Retail for non-payment of dues. Future Retail owes banks Rs 5,322.32 crore as of March 31, according to Bank of India’s petition in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

Rapid expansion and acquisition of several retail assets have burdened Future Group with debt over the past few years. The company’s debt woes were exacerbated by the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown that strained its liquidity position and led to rating downgrades.

Future Retail alone made a loss of Rs 4,445 crore in the last four quarters, the company said in an exchange filing on February 26.

In a stock exchange filing on April 23, Reliance Industries said the $3.4 billion deal to take over the retail assets of Future Retail could not be implemented because the company's secured creditors had ""voted against the scheme.”

While over 75 percent of Future Group's shareholders and unsecured creditors had voted in favour of the deal with Reliance, 69.29 percent of secured creditors rejected the deal and the remaining 30.71 percent voted in favour of it, Future Retail said in an exchange filing on April 22.

Wait-and-watch game

“The plan is now to start insolvency proceedings against all Future Group companies. Clearly, the majority of the lenders were not happy with what Reliance was offering in the deal, and were uncertain about some aspects of it,” said a banker with a leading state-run bank that has exposure to Future Group.

“Now, there is no option but to wait and watch. Once the formal insolvency process begins, let Reliance come and submit a fresh bid,” added the banker, who requested anonymity.

Another senior banker with a state-owned bank said: “Right now, banks are looking at how to get the best value out of Future Group’s assets, and the process of starting insolvency proceedings against all of Future Group companies will be initiated shortly.”

Ideally, when a bankruptcy process is initiated, the Committee of Creditors selects a resolution professional who takes care of the entire debt resolution process. The committee also calls for potential suitors to bid for assets of the company and votes for the highest bidder.

Uncertainty ahead for banks

To be fair, banks have already made provisions against Future Group accounts to shield their balance sheets from a potential default. Given the history of long-drawn-out insolvency proceedings, analysts said this could mean banks will take a long time to recover their loans.

According to Asutosh Mishra, head of research at Ashika Stock Broking, even if there are potential suitors, bids are likely to be close to the liquidation value of the group and that could mean “minimal recovery” for lenders.

“Apart from a few large cases, overall recovery from the IBC process has been very low for banks, and this time, given Future Group’s complex (legal) situation, it should be no different,” Mishra said. IBC is short for the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

Mishra was referring to Future Group’s insolvency process, which faces legal hurdles from US online retail giant Amazon.com Inc.

In 2019, Amazon invested $200 million in Future Coupons Pvt Ltd, the group’s gift voucher unit, for a 49 percent stake, by virtue of which the US company secured a 7.3 percent foothold in Future Retail. Amazon tried to block Future Group’s deal with Reliance by obtaining a freeze order on it from a Singapore arbitration court. The dispute gradually snowballed into a slew of cases that are pending across multiple Indian courts.

New valuation methodology

Analysts also said prospective bidders may want to submit fresh bids to acquire the company, but its valuation methodology will have to consider the value erosion of Future Group’s assets and a fresh assessment of the company’s debt obligations.

“Now that the companies will most likely be dragged in the insolvency court, potential suitors, and that could also include Reliance, will have to re-work the asset size of the company and submit fresh bids. Depending on the size of the new bids, banks will reassess their haircuts and debt recovery potential,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, director at IIFL Securities Ltd.

Legal experts said banks can file an insolvency application under section 7 of the IBC and that it could be their best option of going ahead.

“For the Future Groups companies, a restructuring scheme is not a possible option,” said Anushkaa Arora, principal and founder, ABA Law Office.

“Under the IBC, Reliance Retail can participate in the bidding process for Future Group's assets and bid afresh to take over the company’s assets,” Arora added.

According to Pooja Chakrabarti, a partner at Argus Partners (Solicitors & Advocates), as the businesses of the Future Group companies are dependent on each other, a complete resolution would make more sense.

“Banks could also move the Debt Recovery Tribunal seeking repayment of outstanding dues, injunction against alienation of assets and allied prayers against the defaulting entities,” Chakrabarti added.

Reliance Retail Limited, the subsidiary of Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL) – the holding company of all the retail companies under the Reliance Industries Limited, is set to launch stores that would be built on a dedicated artisan-only format to showcase artisanal products. This would include agriculture and food products, handlooms, clothing, textiles, handicrafts, and handmade natural products.

Reliance Retail announced on April 21 that it is embarking on several new initiatives aimed at showcasing authentic handcrafted products and promoting the rich Indian art forms globally, which will not only help revive various traditional Indian art and craft forms, but also provide sustainable livelihood for hundreds and thousands of artisans and craftsmen in the ecosystem while presenting a new platform to take Indian crafts to consumers across the world.

The plan to launch the artisan-centric stores across the country is expected to provide a strong impetus to the company’s ‘Handmade in India' programme. The programme is being spearheaded by Reliance Retail’s handicrafts brand ‘Swadesh’, which envisages an artisan-only dedicated store format for handcrafted products from across the country.

The first such Swadesh store is expected to open in the second half of the current year and will house a wide range of products including handmade textiles, handicrafts, agriculture products and other artisanal merchandise sourced directly from artisans, RRL said in a statement.

The statement added: “Swadesh will also build a global marketplace to connect Indian artisans and sellers of authentic handmade products to consumers across the world.”

RRVL Director Isha Ambani said: “The future of Indian arts and crafts is poised at an exciting stage. Our past efforts towards development of a robust infrastructure towards reviving dying art forms and building and enabling ecosystem for local artisans, weavers and craftsmen have yielded encouraging results. Our standalone handicrafts destination store format, Swadesh is now on the anvil and will present India through its Art and Crafts and it will showcase everything from apparel, home textiles, home décor, furniture, jewellery, wellness products, and more.”

“We see a great opportunity for the artisans of our country in co-creating and co-curating handcrafted Indian products for the world. To realise this opportunity Reliance Retail is partnering with various government organisations to help popularise various local art forms, both nationally and globally. Reliance Retail and Reliance Foundation have also aligned to identify core epicentres for various indigenous crafts and will set up RiSE centres, a robust network of skill development centres to ensure reach at grassroots level and to contribute in sustaining artisan communities and art forms,” she added.

According to a statement released by RRL, “Swadesh aims to create a unique eco-system for reviving languishing crafts, enhancing skills of the creative communities by providing skill enhancement /design trainings, capacity building workshops that will ensure sustainable livelihoods for artisan communities.”

It has already partnered with several government undertakings and state governments and has also signed an MoU with the Ministry of Textiles which enables the sourcing of 100 percent authentically crafted products, directly from artisan communities.

Future Retail Ltd was ""hanging by a thread"", as only 374 of its stores remained with it after over 830 shops shut down on the lapse of lease due to the non-payment of rent, the company told the Supreme Court on April 1.

""Amazon wanted to destroy us... they have destroyed us,"" senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Future Retail, said. He was referring to the litigation kicked off by the American e-commerce giant to block the Rs 27,000-crore asset sale deal between Future Retail and Reliance Retail, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries.

The court was hearing Amazon's plea to restrain Future Retail from alienating its retail assets until arbitration between the American company and the Kishore Biyani-owned group concluded.

""This court and other courts were repeatedly told by Future group that there will be no transfer of any assets and the proceedings before the NCLT should be allowed to go on,"" senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, who is representing Amazon, told the Supreme Court bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana. ""Your Lordships have recorded this undertaking in your order.""

Future Retail said it had not affected the transfer of its stores and the eviction action was initiated by the landlords.

""We have not breached anything,"" senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, arguing for Future Coupons Pvt Ltd, said. ""Landlords are bound to take action if rent has not been paid... are we supposed to resist landlords when lakhs of rupees of rent remain unpaid?""

Future Retail's accounts have been frozen by the lenders after they were declared non-performing assets and no payments, even towards rent, could be made, he said.

Future Retail's lapsed leases were now in favour of Reliance and it was unfathomable that over 830 stores could be let go without any attempt to save them, senior advocate Aspi Chinoy, arguing for Amazon, said.

Responding to the allegation, Rohtagi questioned how could an injunction be sought against landlords and the new tenants?

Salve said Reliance couldn’t possibly be directed or refrained from doing something in the case since it was not a party to the dispute in the court.

The Supreme Court asked Amazon how could interim relief be granted when it involved restraining alienation of stores and the landlords owning the shops were not parties before the court.

A consortium of banks that are owed money by Future Retail urged the court not to pass an interim order that could prejudice the interests and rights of the lenders.

The case will next be heard on April 4 when the court is expected to conclude the hearing.

The casefile

Future Retail, which is now on the brink of bankruptcy, had announced an asset sale deal worth Rs 27,000 crore with Reliance Retail in 2020. The announcement came on the back of the brick-and-mortar retail businesses taking a hit due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The deal, however, was stayed in October 2020 by an emergency arbitrator under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) rules after Amazon invoked arbitration.

The American firm had entered into an investment deal with Future Coupons Pvt Ltd, a Future group firm, for Rs 1,400 crore. It gave certain protective rights to Amazon and barred the Future group from doing business with certain entities which involved Reliance Industries.

The court was responding to an application filed by the American firm on March 16, a day after it raised the issue of Future Retail’s shops and assets being taken over by Reliance Industries. The court had allowed Amazon to file an application to seek relief.

After Amazon filed a 370-page application, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said it would not be possible to pass orders on interim relief the same day as the court needed time to go through the document.

The court proposed that the arbitration proceedings before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) governed tribunal may resume, where Amazon could press for the relief.

While Future group’s counsel was agreeable to resumption of proceedings, Amazon pressed for interim relief even if the hearing were to resume.

“The tribunal has already granted protection (against alienation of Future group’s assets),” Amazon’s counsel Gopal Subramanium told the court.

“If there has been no adherence of the order passed in 2020 till now then there is no point to file another application before the tribunal.”

Future Retail’s counsel Harish Salve said the main petition before the court concerned resumption of arbitration proceedings. With all parties agreeing to go before the tribunal, the interim relief application also ought to be heard only by one forum. “It cannot be pressed here also (before SC) and before the tribunal also,” he said.

The top court will now hear the case on interim relief on March 23. Future group has been directed by the court to file its reply to Amazon’s application. No order was passed on the resumption of arbitration.

The Supreme Court is hearing Amazon’s plea seeking resumption of arbitration proceedings before the SIAC. The proceedings were stayed the Delhi High Court in February, which was challenged by the American company in the Supreme Court.

Earlier, the Supreme Court said the case for resumption of arbitration hinged on the validity of the order passed by the Competition Commission of India in December 2021.

The CCI had suspended its approval for Amazon-Future group deal. The Future group secured a stay on arbitration proceedings based on CCI order, while Amazon approached the appellate forum, challenging its validity.

The top court observed that the NCLAT’s decision on CCI order’s validity was crucial before it could proceed with the case.

Amazon proposed informal talks with the Future group to arrive at an amicable solution. The talks, however, failed, the court was informed. While the talks were on, many of Future group’s shops were taken over by Reliance Retail, which saw Amazon seek court’s intervention once again.

The Supreme Court was informed on March 15 that talks between Amazon and Future Group were not successful. The apex court is currently hearing Amazon’s plea seeking resumption of arbitration proceedings with Future group. These proceedings before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) governed tribunal were stayed in February by the Delhi High Court. The basis for this interim stay was the Competition Commission of India (CCI) suspending its approval for the investment deal between Amazon and Future group’s firm, Future Coupons Pvt Ltd.

The protracted legal dispute between Amazon and Future group moved into a new leg of litigation following the CCI order of December 2021 which suspended the approval for the deal in question.

While Amazon challenged the stay before the Supreme Court, it also challenged the correctness of the CCI’s decision before the appellate body – the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). Considering the intertwined nature of the proceedings, the apex court, in February, said that NCLAT’s decision on whether or not CCI order stands is critical for the case to proceed.

What CCI said in its order of December 2021, therefore, assumes importance in the case at this stage.

In a one-of-its-kind move, the CCI kept in abeyance its approval for the 2019 investment deal on the grounds that Amazon had not divulged its real intention with respect to the investment deal with Future Coupons.

Referring to the Amazon’s strategic interest in Future Retail’s brick and mortar retail shop chain Big Bazaar, the antitrust watchdog said that this critical information was not furnished before the regulator when Amazon sought its approval.

In its order, the CCI said that it was “a clear, conscious and willful case of omission” on Amazon’s part to disclose that its investment in a private firm of the Future group was done with the intention to secure interest in the public listed company. “The Internal Correspondence discussed above clearly demonstrates that Amazon had failed to disclose true and complete details of the purpose of the Combination,” the CCI stated in its order holding Amazon culpable of suppressing material information while seeking CCI’s approval.

As per the competition watchdog, Amazon not only suppressed the material facts but continued the misrepresentation.

“Such conducts of Amazon amount to suppression and misrepresentation,” the CCI held in its order while also imposing a fine of Rs 202 crore on Amazon.

The scheme, or combination, that the CCI refers to in its order relates to the terms in Amazon’s agreement with Future Coupons Pvt Ltd which gives Amazon the first right over Future Retail’s assets in the event India’s law governing FDI change to allow for the same. Moreover, the terms also made certain parties “prohibited” for the Future group to enter into business with. This condition precluded Future group from doing business with the Reliance group.

As per the CCI, these material facts being suppressed would amount to obtaining CCI’s approval by fraud, the order noted.

While Amazon vehemently denied any wrongdoing and claimed to have disclosed its interests adequately, the CCI kept its approval in abeyance. This move does not mean termination or revocation of the approval but its temporary suspension. The CCI gave Amazon a chance to seek fresh approval from the CCI by placing all the relevant and material on record.

Amazon, however, chose the second remedy that was available to it – challenge the CCI order.

The outcome of the fate of this CCI order will shape the way the legal dispute turns going forward.

Talks between Future group and Amazon to resolve their dispute, which is at the heart of a battle for supremacy in the country's retail sector, have not been successful, the Supreme Court was informed today.

Earlier this month, Amazon had proposed to hold talks with all the stakeholders in this dispute in an attempt to arrive at an amicable solution. The Supreme Court had granted parties time to hold informal talks without any mediators.

If the talks bear no fruit, then the court can decide the dispute judicially, the top court had remarked while encouraging the parties to give talks a chance.

Today, the US-ecommerce giant also flagged the development concerning transfer of Future Retail’s shops to Reliance Industries. “All this time we have heard them (Future group) argue that let proceedings go on before the NCLT and nothing will happen. Now the shops have been transferred to Reliance,” senior counsel Gopal Subramanium representing Amazon said.

“We don’t want the message to go out that orders of courts can be flouted,” he added.

This charge was vehemently denied by Future Retail’s counsel Harish Salve. “Rents have not been paid for past two years and landlords have terminated the leases,” he said. “We (Future Retail) are broke… They (Amazon) have brought us to our knees.

“Parties to this dispute have not made any transfer of assets,” Salve stressed.

With the talks between parties remaining inconclusive, the issue of resumption of arbitration proceedings is now the main point of contention before the top court. Meanwhile, Amazon also urged the court to pass interim orders to ensure that Future Retail’s assets are not transferred to Reliance when the dispute remains pending.

The Supreme Court has allowed Amazon to move an application seeking interim relief and will hear the case on the issue of this relief on March 16.

On March 3, the proposal for talks was accepted by Future group too, with a caveat that Amazon does not initiate criminal proceedings against Future group as was reported in the media at the time. Amazon termed the media report “incorrect” which, in effect, meant giving an undertaking to the effect of not initiating criminal action.

Supreme Court is currently hearing Amazon’s plea challenging the Delhi High Court’s interim order passed in February that stayed the arbitration proceedings between Amazon and Future group before Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) governed tribunal.

The high court’s order was based on the Competition Commission of India’s suspension of its approval for the Amazon-Future group investment deal of 2019. It was the agreement for this deal that provided for dispute resolution through arbitration as per SIAC rules.

Meanwhile, the CCI’s suspension order is under challenge before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). Separately, the Delhi High Court is hearing a batch of cases concerning award passed by the emergency arbitrator in this dispute.

Reliance Infrastructure-promoted Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt Ltd (DAMEPL) had moved the Delhi High Court seeking enforcement of an arbitration award of 2017 passed in its favour relating to Delhi Airport Metro Express Line.

The arbitration award “cannot be allowed to remain as a paper award,” the high court said in its judgment rendered on March 10. The court asked DMRC to divert funds available with it under various funds and accounts towards execution of the arbitration award. DMRC can seek permission from the central government or raise loans to discharge this obligation, the high court said.

After factoring in the amount of Rs 1,678 crore already paid by DMRC, the dues claimed by Reliance Infra, including interest per the arbitration award, stood at Rs 6,330 crore.

The high court has granted DMRC two weeks’ time to pay a sum of Rs 824.10 to Reliance Infra’s DAMEPL. The remainder of the amount owed towards the decreed amount is required to be paid by DMRC in two equal instalments to be fulfilled on or before April 30 and May 31 respectively.

The plea filed by Reliance Infra’s arm before the high court had sought a direction for DMRC to deposit the amount of over Rs 6,330 crore in an escrow account in line with the arbitral award.

DMRC, however, had challenged the amount claimed by Reliance Infra and said that after making payments, it owed around Rs 3,500 crore to Reliance Infra.

In February this year, when the high court concluded hearing in the case and reserved its judgment, DMRC undertook to deposit a sum of Rs 600 crore in the escrow account forthwith towards the decreed amount payment. This undertaking was taken on record by the high court.

For the remainder of the money that DMRC claims to owe, the public sector undertaking had sought for extension in time for repayment.

DMRC and Reliance Infra's DAMEPL had entered into a contract in 2008 for the Delhi Airport Metro Express Line. DAMEPL terminated the concession agreement with DMRC in 2012 on the grounds that the DMRC was not fulfilling certain requirements pertaining to curing construction defects within the stipulated time.

DMRC invoked arbitration thereafter and the award was passed in favour of DAMEPL. This award was upheld by the Supreme Court. Subsequently, the Delhi High Court was moved for the execution of the arbitral award.",429,-0.9371509552001953

Prospective customers were turned back by security, disappointed at the closed state of the store that still carries the signage of Future's biggest brand, Big Bazaar, but which will likely soon be rebranded as a Reliance outlet.

Across India, similar scenes are being played out as Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), India's biggest conglomerate run by Mukesh Ambani, the country's richest man, presses ahead with a shock de facto takeover of prized retail real estate that Amazon.com Inc has been keen to take part-ownership of.

The high-profile bitter dispute between corporate titans in which Amazon has sought to block Reliance's planned $3.4 billion purchase of Future Group's retail assets is currently before India's Supreme Court.

Reliance's takeover began with utmost stealth on the night of February 25 when its staff began arriving at Future stores. Many in Future's management were in the dark about the plans as store employees from all over the country frantically began to call, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

""It was tense, everybody was panicking. We didn't know who they were. They wanted access and seniors didn't know about it,"" a New Delhi Big Bazaar store employee said, describing what happened around 8 p.m. that day.

At a Future store in Sonipat town in northern Haryana state, announcements were made asking customers to leave as Reliance seized control, one source said. In Vadodara in western Gujarat, Future employees arriving for work the next morning were asked to go back home with no explanation, said another source.

Citing unpaid payments by Future, Reliance has taken control of operations of some 200 Big Bazaar stores and has plans to seize another 250 of Future's retail outlets. Combined, they represent the crown jewels of Future's retail network and around a third of all Future outlets.

Although Reliance had not played a large public role in the legal dispute, it had, according to sources, for some months assumed many of the leases held by cash-strapped Future, India's No. 2 retailer and Amazon's estranged business partner.

Reliance's sudden possession of the stores appears to have landed what some analysts are calling a coup de grace that spoils Amazon's chances of untangling the transfer of Future's assets to Reliance. That's despite a series of legal battles won by the U.S. e-commerce giant to date blocking the 2020 deal announced between the two Indian companies.

""What will Amazon fight for now?"" said a source close to the U.S. company with knowledge of the legal dispute. ""The shops are gone.""

Representatives for Reliance, Amazon and Future did not respond to Reuters queries for this article. Sources asked not to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the dispute.

AFTER THE TAKEOVER, TALKS

Future Retail said on Feb. 26 it was ""scaling down its operations"" to cut losses although it made no mention of Reliance in its statement. Future Group as a whole has more than $4 billion in debt.

Reliance plans to retain Future's employees at the stores it takes over, sources have said.

Amazon, which has a stake in a separate Future Group unit that it argues prevents Future from selling retail assets without its permission, has called the supermarkets and other stores an ""irreplaceable"" network in a sector worth $900 billion in revenues annually.

The legal wrangles had over time become increasingly high-stakes and marked by ugly rhetoric. At one point, Amazon sought for Future Chief Executive Kishore Biyani to be detained in prison for disobeying a legal order. And Future once likened Amazon to Alexander the Great and his ""ruthless ambition to scorch the earth"".

But on Thursday, six days after Reliance's move, Amazon at a Supreme Court hearing unexpectedly called for cordial talks to end the dispute - a proposal Future agreed to.

""People have taken over shops ... let's at least have a conversation,"" Amazon's lawyer Gopal Subramanium said.

Discussions are expected to begin soon.

Whatever the outcome of the talks, analysts say Amazon had gravely underestimated Reliance.

""If anybody should have seen this coming, it should have been Amazon and they should have prepared against it,"" said Devangshu Dutta of retail consultancy Third Eyesight.

Senior counsel representing Amazon, Gopal Subramanium, proposed before the Supreme Court today that the parties hold informal talks without mediators in order to arrive at an amicable solution to put the multifarious legal dispute to rest.

The court bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana was hearing Amazon's appeal against the Delhi High Court staying arbitration proceedings between the ecommerce giant and Future group.

While the Supreme Court favoured deferring the hearing owing to the pending and connected cases before National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and Delhi High Court, it also urged the parties to find an amicable solution.

The top court said it remains open to deciding on the dispute should the parties not be able to resolve it. However, an attempt for an amicable resolution ought to be made, the court added.

The proposition was not opposed by the Future group which urged the court to take up the case after a period of 10 days during which period the parties along with Reliance can hold talks.

Amazon's request to direct NCLAT and Delhi High Court to withhold pronouncement of any final orders in this period of 10 days was denied by the top court.

Meanwhile, Future sought an undertaking from Amazon not to take any fresh legal steps against the group during this 10-day period. Senior counsel Harish Salve, arguing for one of the Future group firms, cited a news report which hinted at Amazon's intention to initiate criminal proceedings against the Future group.

Amazon's counsel termed the report as ""incorrect"".

The Supreme Court is now likely to hear the case next on March 15.

Amazon had approached the Supreme Court after a division bench of the Delhi High Court had passed an interim order staying arbitration proceedings before the tribunal under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) rules.

The Supreme Court had earlier indicated waiting for the NCLAT ruling on the validity of the Competition Commission of India (CCI)’s order of December 2017. The top court had said that the outcome of the challenge to the CCI order is crucial for the case before it as the arguments of both the parties hinge on the CCI order.

The Future group argues that with the CCI approval for the investment deal in suspension, the arbitration proceedings are rendered irrelevant. Amazon, on the other hand, says that the proceedings are independent of the underlying contracts and agreements. It has also challenged the CCI’s suspension order before the NCLAT.

The CJI-led bench of the Supreme Court had asked the parties to urge the NCLAT to hear and decide on the challenge to the CCI order expeditiously.

The High Court is scheduled to hear Future group’s case seeking termination of the arbitration proceedings in the third week of March after it stayed the proceedings as an interim measure. Meanwhile, a single-judge bench is hearing a batch of cases involving Amazon and Future group almost on a daily basis in order to conclude the case expeditiously.

Reliance Industries has stepped in to rescue Future Retail Limited (FRL), taking over the operations of its stores and offering jobs to its employees, even as the Kishore Biyani-led group is locked in a bitter legal wrangle with e-commerce major Amazon at several judicial forums over the sale of its business to the retail arm of the oil-to-telecom conglomerate.

Reliance Retail has started taking over operations of Future Retail stores such as Big Bazaar and replaced them with its brand stores, according to sources.

Future Group has been finding it difficult to finance its working capital needs. In a stock exchange filing on February 26, Future Retail said it plans to scale down its offline operations to reduce its losses in the coming months and instead focus on expanding its online and home delivery business.

“The company has been finding it difficult to finance the working capital needs. Increasing losses at store level is a grave concern and is a vicious cycle where larger operations are leading to higher losses,” it added.

The company has made a loss of Rs 4,445 crore in the last four quarters. Termination notices have been received for a significant number of stores due to huge outstanding, and it would no longer have access to such store premises.

The retail major also informed that the long stop date for its scheme of arrangement with Reliance Industries has been extended to September 30.

“The company is hopeful that the scheme of arrangement proposed with Reliance will be implemented which will be beneficial for all the stakeholders,” it said.

In August 2020, the boards of Future Retail Ltd, Future Group companies, and Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) approved a Scheme of Arrangement for the transfer of Future Group’s retail and logistics business to RRVL on a slump sale basis for an aggregate consideration of Rs 24,713 crore.

At the time of the agreement, Future Group was in acute financial trouble. It had defaulted on payments to creditors and landlords for its leased premises. The amount outstanding to the creditors and the landlords exceeded a staggering Rs 6,000 crore.

At the same time, Amazon initiated a litigation against the Future-Reliance deal. From the Supreme Court to the Delhi high court, from company law tribunal to the appellate tribunal and a Singapore arbitration panel, Amazon has dug into its deep pockets to stymie the scheme of arrangement under which the troubled Future group would have been rescued by Reliance Retail.

This dealt a blow to the creditors and the landlords for Future Retail.

According to people close to the development, had the situation persisted, Future Group would have suffered a severe loss in value and plunged into insolvency.

Unable to bear the burden of defaults, many landlords terminated their lease agreements with FRL by January 2021.

Sources said it was in these dire circumstances that several landlords of FRL, who knew about the Scheme of Arrangement as it was in public domain, approached Reliance for support. Taking cognisance of the situation, sources said, Reliance took a slew of measures to enable FRL to continue its operations, avoid the prospects of insolvency.

Reliance ensured payment of dues to a number of landlords by signing lease agreements for their premises and at the same time, it enabled FRL to continue its operations at these premises.

Reliance has so far incurred an expense of over Rs 1,500 crore towards payment of dues, as per sources.

It also extended working capital support to FRL, according to sources, with which FRL has been able to pay its statutory dues, repay interests and one-time settlement amounts to banks, and continue its business operations. So far, Reliance has lent a total of Rs 3,700 crore to FRL as working capital support to the company, said people close to the development.

However, in spite of Reliance’s support, FRL incurred losses of over Rs 4,445 crore during the calendar year 2021. Therefore, to help FRL contain its losses, Reliance has exercised its rights to control and manage FRL’s loss-making stores, they added.

A Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana noted that the issue of arbitration proceedings hinges on an order passed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on December 17, keeping in abeyance its approval for the investment deal between Amazon and Future Group.

With Amazon challenging the CCI order, and Future group, on the other hand, citing the CCI order for seeking termination of the arbitration proceedings, the decision of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) becomes crucial n the case.

The present case, the Supreme Court said, is in one way or the other connected with the outcome of the NCLAT’s decision on the validity of the CCI order. The NCLAT is scheduled to hear the appeal on February 25. Accordingly, the Supreme Court deferred the hearing till NCLAT concludes its hearing.

The apex court asked the parties to seek an expeditious hearing before the NCLAT while adjourning the case till March 3.

Amazon informed the apex court today that the arbitration proceedings had been suspended after the high court’s order. ""It is in the best interest of all stakeholders if the (arbitration) proceedings are concluded expeditiously,” Senior Counsel Gopal Subramanium said representing the ecommerce major.

Future Group highlighted that the December 17 order of the CCI formed the basis for it to seek termination of the arbitration proceedings. However, the CCI order is challenged before the appellate forum by Amazon, Senior Counsel Mukul Rohatgi told the Supreme Court. The fate of the CCI order at this point remains uncertain, he explained.

The apex court has decided to wait for clarity from the NCLAT on the issue of validity of the CCI order before hearing Amazon’s appeal challenging the Delhi High Court’s stay order on arbitration proceedings.

The Delhi High Court had in January passed an interim order staying the arbitration proceedings that were going on before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) governed tribunal on a plea made by the Future Group.

Future Group took support in the Competition Commission of India’s (CCI) December 2021 order which temporarily suspended the regulator’s approval for the 2019 investment deal between Amazon and one of Future Group firm Future Coupons Pvt Ltd. It was this investment deal due to which the arbitration proceedings were kicked off.

Future group claimed that with the CCI approval for the deal suspended, the deal is no longer in force and the arbitration proceedings emanating from the same are rendered irrelevant. A division bench of the high court found prima facie merit in this argument and stayed the proceedings till further orders.

Future Group had moved the high court after the tribunal was unable to accommodate its plea seeking termination of the arbitration proceedings on priority. While a single-judge of the high court dismissed the plea, a division-bench proceeded to stay the proceedings.

This stay order brought Amazon to the Supreme Court in appeal.

Amazon and the Future Group locked horns after the American e-commerce giant invoked arbitration. The move was prompted by Future Group’s listed company – Future Retail Ltd – announcing an asset sale deal valuing around Rs 27,000 crore with Reliance Industries’ wholly owned subsidiary Reliance Retail.

The asset sale deal between the two leading retail players in India was a result of Future Retail running into losses owing to the reduced business for brick-and-mortar retail stores due to the pandemic.

Amazon claimed to have the first right in Future Group’s retail business on account of the 2019 investment deal with Future Coupons. Amazon claimed that the agreement also barred Future Group from entering into business with certain entities which included the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani Group. This caused Amazon to invoke arbitration on the announcement of the asset sale deal between Future Group and Reliance.

The dispute between Amazon and Future Group has developed into a convoluted web of litigation ever since.

In what could be the biggest disruption in India’s hydrogen processing industry, Reliance Industries has decided to repurpose its Rs 30,000-crore petroleum processing plant to produce vast amounts of blue hydrogen. The move is part of the conglomerate’s plans to become the world’s largest blue hydrogen producer.

Amid the global scramble for new sources of clean fuels, the government announced the National Hydrogen Mission in August 2021. Moneycontrol takes a deep dive into why this latest version of hydrogen is generating interest among Indian Inc and policymakers alike, what the environmental impact will be, and how he size of the renewable energy payoff.

What is clean hydrogen?

Hydrogen is the cleanest-known form of fuel. It is zero-carbon, and when burned with oxygen, provides the same function as petrol or diesel at much low levels of pollution. Hydrogen fuel-based internal combustion engines can be used to run all kinds of vehicles. It is expected to be used in lieu of aviation turbine fuel in few years while Tesla has planned to use it in spacecraft propulsion.

Over the past few years, nations have increasingly turned to it due to its potential to displace fossil fuels in heavily polluting sectors that solar and wind cannot effectively target. Interest in the developing technology has also peaked as countries commit to aggressive decarbonisation targets, which invariably include plans to phase out diesel and petrol vehicles, oil-run power plants and even conventional public transport systems.

So far, much of the focus and the bulk of the hydrogen market has been commanded by green hydrogen, which is produced from renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power, or low carbon power and is known to be the benchmark for clean fuel. Water is split into two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom through a process called electrolysis. However, on a commercial scale, it is mostly generated by steam reforming of natural gas.

What is the situation globally?

As with any potentially game-changing technology, countries across the globe have gotten into the race to establish hydrogen production and domestic hydrogen markets.

In 2020, major European companies announced plans to switch their truck fleets completely to hydrogen-based vehicles with the Netherlands and Switzerland already beginning commercial production of hydrogen trucks. Looking to replace costly liquefied natural gas imports, Japan has announced an action plan to set up 10,000 hydrogen refuelling stations over the next decade.

Nations considered traditionally conservative when it comes to energy policy such as Australia, Russia and the United States have also announced projects to tap the fuel. Closer home, China has announced the production of 1 million fuel-cell vehicles by 2030. It has also developed hydrogen fuel cell hybrid locomotives, and a vehicle subsidy policy that focuses on fuel cell tech manufacturing across the whole value chain.

What exactly is blue hydrogen and how is it different from other forms of hydrogen?

Apart from green, hydrogen can also be yellow, turquoise, pink or blue, depending on the production method. Essentially colour codes, these various types of hydrogen vary in their energy payload.

Grey hydrogen is the most common form and is generated from natural gas, or methane, through a process called steam reforming. Pink hydrogen is produced by nuclear power. Blue hydrogen is produced from natural gas with a process of steam methane reforming, whereby natural gas is mixed with very hot steam and a catalyst.

Studies have shown that greenhouse gas emissions from the production of blue hydrogen are quite high, particularly due to the release of fugitive methane. Incidentally, methane is known to be a major destroyer of the ozone layer, Earth’s protective shield that stops radioactive ultraviolet rays from the sun from reaching the surface.

However, it is pegged to be the most commercially viable as production is relatively easier, does not suffer from input shocks, and can be adapted to the technology already available with petroleum refineries, chemical production units and other industries. Since these industries have historically made major investments in their physical infrastructure, blue hydrogen has increasingly become a part of corporate plans.

Overall, hydrogen production suffers from high transportation and storage cost, and leads to higher pricing. As a result, all visions of large hydrogen production mandates that it be co-located on or near-site. For this reason, blue hydrogen has also elicited industry interest.

How has blue hydrogen been received in India?

The overall Indian hydrogen market was valued at $50 million in 2017, and is projected to reach $81 million by 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 6.3 percent from 2018 to 2025, according to Allied Market Research. The Centre’s ambitious National Hydrogen Mission focuses on green hydrogen production and utilisation, and aims to align India’s efforts with global best practices in technology, policy and regulation.

However, as carbon emission reduction goals prove to be a challenge, the government has indicated that it may be open to the production of hydrogen through other means as well. Reliance Industries is now set to repurpose a Rs 30,000-crore plant that currently converts petroleum coke into synthesis gas or syngas, to become a production site for blue hydrogen, the company has said. It has priced the hydrogen at $1.20-1.50 per kg.

Reliance has set a net-zero carbon emission target for its businesses by 2035. It is reportedly planning to turn syngas into blue hydrogen in the interim period, while the cost of green hydrogen reduces.

How will it reduce energy imports?

According to official statistics, India currently spends over Rs 12 lakh crore on energy imports, of which crude oil and allied products make up Rs 7.45 lakh crore. The government has set a target to become energy independent by the time of India’s 100th Independence Day, over the next 25 years. Meanwhile, Indian Railways has plans to go completely carbon-neutral by 2030.

While most government incentives for domestic energy production have revolved around solar and wind power generation, it is currently planning to provide production-linked incentives for hydrogen producers as well. Converting smaller coal-fired power plants into hydrogen-fuelled plants has also reportedly been suggested.

Officials say the largescale switch to green hydrogen would take time as domestic energy producers shift from liquefied petroleum gas to hydrogen. For this, they say blue hydrogen would act as a necessary step.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd is targeting to become one of the largest producers of blue hydrogen globally, producing zero-emission fuel at costs that will be half of the global average.

The operator of the world's largest oil refining complex will repurpose a Rs 30,000 crore plant that currently converts petroleum coke into synthesis gas to produce blue hydrogen for USD 1.2-1.5 a kilogram, Reliance said in a presentation detailing the separation plan.

Hydrogen is the cleanest form of known fuel. Depending on production methods, hydrogen can be grey, blue, or green. While grey hydrogen is the most common form and is generated from natural gas, or methane, through a process called 'steam reforming', blue hydrogen is whenever the carbon generated from steam reforming is captured and stored.

Blue hydrogen is, therefore, sometimes referred to as carbon neutral as the emissions are not dispersed in the atmosphere. Green hydrogen - also referred to as 'clean hydrogen' - is produced by using clean energy from renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, to split water into two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom through a process called electrolysis.

Reliance, which has set a net-zero carbon emission target for its businesses by 2035, is looking at blue hydrogen in the interim period while the cost of green hydrogen reduces.

""In the interim, till the cost of green hydrogen comes down, RIL can be the first mover to establish a hydrogen ecosystem, with minimal incremental investment, in India,"" Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) said in the presentation.

Syngas has the potential to produce hydrogen at a competitive cost of USD 1.2-1.5 per kg, it said. Green hydrogen produced with renewable resources costs between USD 3-6.55 per kg, according to the European Commission's July 2020 Hydrogen strategy.

Fossil-based hydrogen costs about USD 1.80, and the commission estimated the cost of blue hydrogen at about USD 2.40-3 per kg. Ambani had previously stated that his group is aiming to produce green hydrogen at USD 1 per kilogram by the turn of this decade. Last month, he announced plans to invest about USD 75 billion in renewables infrastructure.

Reliance said RIL's framework for reducing carbon footprint includes migration from fossil energy to renewables, maximizing sustainable materials and chemicals as part of its portfolio, and carbon fixation, capture, and utilization.

""Transition to Net Carbon Zero provides a unique opportunity to unlock value through repurposing of assets and upgradation of configuration,"" it said.

At its mega oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat, the low value fuel streams (off-gases) are taken out from the fuel pool and used as feedstock to convert to high value petrochemicals. This syngas project will now be transferred to a subsidiary it owns fully with a view to unlocking value.

""Jamnagar energy demand is currently met through fossil fuels including syngas from the gasifiers. Fossil fuel can be replaced by renewables, including solar, biomass-based fuel, hydrogen and changing steam drives to electric drives"", the firm noted.

Jamnagar will progressively transition to renewables with a battery energy storage system (BESS) to meet its electricity and steam demand. Over a period of time, hydrogen demand will be met by green hydrogen produced through water electrolysis. Repurposing the gasification assets will involve using syngas to produce hydrogen.

""Subsequently, as hydrogen from syngas is replaced by green hydrogen, the entire syngas will be converted to chemicals,"" the firm said, adding it will explore biomass feed in gasification to produce green hydrogen.

""Hydrogen production from gasification provides highly concentrated carbon-di-oxide (CO2) stream which provides unique opportunity to capture 15 million tonnes per annum of CO2 at 30 percent of the typical cost of carbon capture,"" Reliance said adding this CO2 can be monetized by sale to urea producers and other users.

The gasification unit is proposed to be transferred, as a going concern on slump sale basis, by way of the proposed scheme, it said, adding the scheme of Arrangement has been presented to National Company Law Tribunal for approval.",666,0.9685970693826675

The high court had stayed the proceedings that were going on before a Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) governed tribunal at a time when the process was purportedly in its last leg.

Future group had sought for the proceedings to be terminated and had urged the tribunal itself to hear the termination application on an urgent basis. The basis for seeking this termination was the suspension of Competition Commission of India’s (CCI) approval to the 2019 investment deal between Amazon and Future group.

In 2019, Amazon and Future became partners when the US company invested $200 million in a gift voucher unit of the Indian group. That deal, Amazon argues, came with certain non-compete clauses that prohibited Future from selling retail assets to certain rivals, including Reliance. The deal also included clauses for settlement of any disputes under rules laid down by the SIAC.

But in 2020, Future decided to sell assets to Reliance prompting Amazon to approach Singapore arbitrators.

Future’s case hinges on this CCI order of suspension of approval to the 2019 investment deal and the group says that with the approval recalled, the deal holds no value and as such the proceedings provided for in the contract for the deal are irrelevant. Amazon fervently argued that the arbitration remains independent of the contract itself and cannot be terminated on the basis of a temporary suspension of regulatory approval.

However, the case for termination reached courts in India when the SIAC arbitration tribunal was unable to hear Future’s termination application on a priority basis.

Future knocked on the doors of the Delhi high court. The petition urged the court to direct the arbitration tribunal to hear the termination application before proceeding with the remainder of the case.

A single-judge bench heard the case at first and dismissed Future’s plea following which an intra-court appeal was filed by the group within 24 hours. This led to a division bench hearing the appeal and passing an order, all quickly. It was in this interim order that the arbitration proceedings were stayed, in a huge relief for Future.

Amazon challenged this stay order before the Supreme Court which will now hear the case on February 23.

Meanwhile, an appeal against CCI’s order of suspension of approval is pending before the appellate forum – National Company Law Appellate Tribunal – which is scheduled to hear the case later this month.

Future failed to sell its retail assets to Reliance for $3.4 billion after business partner Amazon went for arbitration and moved court arguing that Future Retail had violated certain non-compete contractual terms. Future denied this.

Amazon wants to own a part of Future Retail as part of its plans to dominate Indian retail.

“There are two suitors for Future Retail and we (banks) have a stake in it and we are entitled to sell the assets,” senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi arguing for the banks said. “Let the two suitors bid for it, why litigate for one year for an uncertain outcome about who will get it.”

Explaining further why bidding was a viable option, Dwivedi said that this was the only “sure shot” method of recovering the money owed to the banks.

Future Retail owes around Rs 17,000 crore to the banks and the overall debt of the entire Future group is larger. The top court was informed today that the lenders have already begun the process of classifying the accounts of Future Retail as NPAs.

If Amazon was to win the litigation, a sum of only Rs 7,000 crore would come in through a private fund to save Future Retail. If the deal with Reliance is allowed to go through, the group will receive Rs 25,000 crore. “There is an element of uncertainty about who will get it,” Dwivedi stressed.

Dwivedi said that the two “cash-rich suitors” can bid for the assets of Future Retail and this is the only way the banks can get the entirety of the money owed and the issue of who gets Future Retail will also be put to rest.

Future Retail agreed with the lenders on the aspect that the interests of public depositors ought to take precedence and stressed that if the Reliance deal fructifies, not only will the “banks be repaid in full” but the jobs of 25,000 employees will be saved.

While Amazon expressed its interest to discuss any possible arrangement with the banks, it highlighted that the injunction orders still remain in force.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court also posed a question regarding continuation of NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) proceedings without the forum passing a final order and proceeded to reserve its order on this issue.

The top court will hear the issue of NPA classification later this month and refused to grant any interim relief to Future Retail against such tagging.

The Delhi High Court orders were not only critical of the Biyanis and other management personnel of Future group firms but had also held them to be in contempt and imposed punitive actions against them.

To recap, in October 2020, an emergency arbitrator (EA) had injuncted Future Retail from proceeding with its Rs 25,000 crore asset-sale deal with Reliance Industries. Under SIAC rules, EA awards are interim in nature and remain in force till they are either affirmed or set aside by a duly constituted arbitral tribunal. In this case, the injunction order of the EA was affirmed by the duly set up arbitration tribunal in October 2021. Both these developments became the subject of litigation before the Delhi High Court.

Two of the three high court orders set aside had been passed by Justice JR Midha – an interim one in February and a final one in March 2021. Justice Midha has since retired. The primary direction of the orders passed by Justice Midha was for enforcement of the award passed by the EA under SIAC rules. Justice Midha also directed the Future Group to ensure that all regulatory approvals received for the transaction were reversed and recalled.

The third order set aside by the top court on February 1 had been pronounced by Justice Suresh Kumar Kait in October 2021. Justice Kait’s court had refused to interfere with the award of the arbitration tribunal, which had affirmed and confirmed the injunction order of the EA.

The Supreme Court said that the challenge to the tribunal order confirming the EA’s order needed to be looked at afresh.

The top court’s intervention does not mean that the Future-Reliance deal can go through. It has, however, has set the clock back by a few months in this long-drawn legal battle.

Here is why the top court set aside the Delhi High Court orders.

“Natural justice is the sworn enemy of unfairness” – Supreme Court

While deciding whether the two orders — interim and final — passed by Justice Midha were valid in law, the court noted a procedural anomaly. The high court had held the Future group and its managerial personnel to be guilty of wilful disobedience and imposed punitive action against them. However, the Supreme Court underlined that this was done without affording sufficient opportunity to the Future group to present its defence.

This procedural error, according to the Supreme Court, goes against the principles of natural justice.

“Natural justice is an important facet of a judicial review. Providing effective natural justice to affected parties, before a decision is taken, is necessary to maintain rule of law,” the Supreme Court said in its judgment.

The principles of natural justice are tied into procedures of the court and these have to be “followed meticulously to ensure that highest standards of fairness are afforded to the parties,” the court said, finding this lacking.

Was it “wilful” disobedience by Future group?

For an action to be called wilful disobedience, the disobedience has to be conscious, the Supreme Court said, while citing precedents on this interpretation.

While Justice Midha found the Future group’s managerial personnel to be in wilful disobedience of the EA’s award because they proceeded to approach regulators for the Future-Reliance deal, the Supreme Court factored in another point of consideration.

In the first round of litigation before an Indian court in December 2020, a single-judge bench of Justice Mukta Gupta of the Delhi High Court had allowed both Amazon and Future group to proceed with their pursuits before various regulators. Future group companies were seeking approvals for the asset sale deal and Amazon was trying to block the approvals by informing the regulators of the EA award.

This order of the high court was challenged but never stayed.

The Supreme Court took note of this order passed by Justice Mukta Gupta as well as previous orders passed by the Supreme Court, which allowed the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to continue hearings concerning the Future-Reliance deal but barred it from passing any final order on the scheme of amalgamation.

This led the top court to set aside Justice Midha’s orders.

What was remanded to the high court and why?

Justice Kait’s order was the third to be set aside on February 1.

The question for consideration before Justice Kait pertained to the award passed by the duly constituted arbitration tribunal which, in October 2021, affirmed the injunction against Future group in an EA award. The high court refused to interfere with this order when Future group challenged it.

While noting that the challenge to the arbitral award brings up important questions of law that need to be decided, the Supreme Court also pointed out that the high court was never barred from ruling on this aspect.

The top court as such remanded the issue to the high court and asked it to decide on the issue afresh “on its own merit.”

What happens next?

A single-judge bench of the Delhi High Court will in due course hear afresh Future group’s plea challenging the arbitral award that had refused to lift the injunctions passed by the EA.

The enforcement of the EA award was set aside by the Supreme Court in this judgment. However, to be clear, the injunctions passed by the EA award still remain in force since the arbitral tribunal affirmed those in October 2021, giving them legal force.

This means that the injunctions against Future group remain, as of now.",962,-0.834855705499649

The Supreme Court on February 1 asked the lenders of Future Retail Ltd to file their response on the company’s plea to be spared the non-performing asset tag on its accounts.

A consortium of 27 banks, including some private and foreign banks, had lent money to Future Retail and issued “event of default” notices to the company after it missed its repayment deadline. The grace period after the deadline lapsed on January 29.

Chief Justice of India NV Ramana headed an apex court bench that heard the case and made an oral observation that the banks too have to take a realistic approach in the matter and consider the consequence of the action they might take against Future group. It gave the lenders till Thursday to file their response to the petition.

While the Kishore Biyani-led company told the top court that it seeks relief in terms of an extension to make the repayment, it said the ongoing legal dispute with Amazon has been the sole reason for the company to be unable to alienate its assets and clear its dues.

With the company being barred from disposing of or alienating any of its assets, Future Retail offered for the banks to take over the company’s small format stores and monetise them for loan repayment, the court was told.

The counsel representing Future Retail and the Biyanis outlined that once the accounts are allowed to be declared as NPA, the logical next step would be initiation of insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. This would “kill the company” and “nothing will survive to fight for”. The banks too would have to take home massive haircuts if the IBC route is taken.

The advocate arguing for the banks, however, told the court that the lenders have nothing to do with either Amazon’s interests in Future Retail’s business, nor with the company's asset sale deal with Reliance. Moreover, Future Retail claims to be bankrupt and does not have the wherewithal to continue with its functions until March 2023, the bank told the apex court, citing one of the filings made by Future Retail.

On being asked about its position by the court, Amazon said that it is also interested in the survival of Future Retail’s business and would not welcome IBC proceedings against it.

The case will be heard once the parties have filed their replies.

The issue of enforcement of the emergency award, in Future group's dispute with Amazon, has been remanded to the high court to be heard afresh on merit.

The apex court bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana was delivering its ruling on a batch of pleas filed by the Future group companies that pertained to the enforcement of the award passed by an emergency arbitrator under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre's rules that injuncted Future group from proceedings with its Rs 25,000 crore asset sale deal with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd.

The Kishore Biyani-led group had challenged orders of the Delhi High Court passed in February 2021 that directed for the enforcement of this emergency award, made adverse remarks against the promoters of Future group, and directed for coercive steps to be taken against Biyani and other key persons in the Future group management.

While the Supreme Court today set aside the order pertaining to coercive steps and adverse remarks, the issue concerning enforcement of the emergency award has been remanded to the high court and must be heard afresh, the court said.

The legal battle between Amazon and Future began back in 2020 when Amazon invoked arbitration after Future Retail announced its asset sale deal with Reliance Industries Ltd’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Reliance Retail. Amazon claimed that its deal with Future Coupons prevented Future Retail also, in capacity of a related party, from entering into agreements with certain entities including the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani group. Future Retail claimed that it was not bound by the deal between Amazon and Future Retail’s promoter firm.

The asset sale deal between India’s two leading retailers was stayed by an emergency arbitrator in October 2020 and the validity of this order was finally affirmed by the Supreme Court in August 2021. While this merger remains stayed, Future group firm moved CCI accusing Amazon of withholding pertinent information leading to the CCI order of December which has now led to a stay on the arbitration proceedings granted by the Delhi High Court.

Asking the parties to file their replies within a period of ten days, the NCLAT fixed the next date of hearing for February 2.

Despite Amazon’s plea for staying the CCI order in the meantime, the NCLAT refrained from granting any interim relief and said that the case will be heard on merits finally on a day before the deadline for Amazon to pay the fine levied by CCI ends.

The US e-commerce giant approached the NCLAT against the order of the Competition Commission of India passed in December 2021 through which the anti-trust body kept in abeyance its approval given for the 2019 investment deal between Amazon and Future Coupons Pvt Ltd, one of the promoter firms of the public listed company Future Retail Ltd. A fine of Rs 202 crore was also levied on Amazon with a window of 60 days to pay the same.

CCI had found that Amazon had withheld certain necessary information concerning Amazon’s strategic interest in Future Retail.

While arguing the case before the NCLAT today, Amazon challenged the CCI order and said that a twin entity investment structure was adopted by Amazon and Future group owing to the existing laws in India concerning Foreign Direct Investment in multi-brand retail. The share-subscription agreement makes it clear that Amazon would invest Rs 1,431 crore in Future Coupons Pvt Ltd which would be directly transmitted to Future Retail Ltd. This information and arrangement were disclosed to the CCI, Amazon’s counsel told the NCLAT.

The arrangement gave certain protective rights to Amazon and also a call option to make a direct investment in Future Retail should the Indian law on FDI change, the appellate tribunal was told. Senior Advocate Gopal Subramanium, representing Amazon, said that the agreement made it clear that Future Retail would not alienate its assets or deal with certain restricted parties which included Reliance Industries. With Future Retail announcing an asset sale deal to a Reliance firm, the contractual obligations are breached, Amazon argued.

The commission’s December 2021 order came after it was Kishore Biyani’s Future Coupons itself that sought for the reconsideration for the CCI approval. This plea by the Future group firm also found support from certain independent directors of Future Retail as well as the Confederation of All India Traders.

The commission did not quash the approval it had granted, but kept it in abeyance and granted time to Amazon to seek approval once again.

While Amazon claims no wrong-doing in securing CCI approval for the 2019 deal, and filed an appeal against CCI’s ruling, Future group sought for the arbitration proceedings between the two giants to be terminated and approached the Delhi High Court for this

Before the NCLAT, Amazon argued that the Future group approached the CCI with a complaint after it feared losing in the arbitration proceedings.

In a major relief for Future group, the Delhi High Court, earlier this month, stayed the arbitration proceedings citing the CCI order stating that the balance of convenience leans in favour of Kishore Biyani’s group companies in light of the CCI order. The stay order has been challenged before the Supreme Court while a separate appeal against the CCI order came before the NCLAT where Amazon cited the development as reason for urgency in hearing the appeal.

The legal battle between Amazon and Future began back in 2020 when Amazon invoked arbitration after Future Retail announced its asset sale deal with Reliance Industries Ltd’s wholly owned subsidiary, Reliance Retail. Amazon claimed that its deal with Future Coupons prevented Future Retail also, in capacity of related party, from entering into agreements with certain entities including the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani group. Future Retail claimed that it was not bound by the deal between Amazon and Future Retail’s promoter firm.

The asset sale deal between India’s two leading retailers was stayed by an emergency arbitrator in October 2020 and the validity of this order was finally affirmed by the Supreme Court in August 2021. While this merger remains stayed, Future group firm moved CCI accusing Amazon of withholding pertinent information leading to the CCI order of December which has now become basis for a fresh round of litigation.

Amazon.com Inc has filed fresh legal challenges in its long-running dispute with Indian retailer Future Group after the national antitrust agency suspended a 2019 deal between the two sides, leading to a halt in their arbitration, four sources told Reuters on Sunday.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) last month suspended its approval of Amazon's 2019 deal with Future, denting the U.S. e-commerce giant's attempts to block the sale of Future's retail assets to Indian market leader Reliance Industries.

The suspension jolted Amazon as subsequently, a New Delhi court halted the arbitration proceedings between the two sides. Late on Saturday night, Amazon filed an appeal against the CCI suspension decision at India's National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, two of the sources said.

Separately, two other sources said that Amazon also filed a challenge in the Supreme Court against the Delhi court decision in which judges last week said Future-Amazon arbitration proceedings must remain on hold until Feb. 1 in light of the antitrust suspension of the deal.

Amazon and the CCI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The filings are the latest in the bitter legal dispute which has embroiled Amazon, Future and Reliance over what is seen as a battle for retail supremacy in India's booming consumer market.

Reliance, run by one of India's richest men Mukesh Ambani, wants to expand its footprint by acquiring debt-laden Future, but Amazon has told India's antitrust body it believes Reliance's consolidated position ""will further restrict competition in the Indian retail market"".

Amazon has long argued that Future violated the terms of its 2019 deal in deciding to sell retail assets to Reliance. The U.S. company's position has so far been backed by the Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts. Future denies any wrongdoing.

But after the CCI suspended that deal's approval, saying Amazon suppressed information while seeking clearances for the deal, Future has argued Amazon no longer has any legal basis to pursue the dispute.

Both of Amazon's appeals, to the Indian tribunal and Supreme Court, are likely to be heard in the coming days, two of the sources said.",351,-0.8682190974553426

Indian companies had flooded the dollar bond market in 2021, emboldened by low-interest rates amid copious global liquidity. That dollar bond party just got extended into 2022 with Reliance Industries Ltd’s latest $4 billion bond issuance.

RIL issued 10-year, 30-year, and a benchmark 40-year dollar bond to global investors at competitive pricing. Its issue received a total subscription in excess of $11 billion which shows that foreign investors are still enamored by Indian bonds. Indeed, during 2021 Indian companies raised $18.5 billion through dollar bond issuances, a 65 percent year-on-year increase according to Dealogic data. The total issuance from India including sovereign added up to $26.03 billion in 2021.

Encore in 2022

Bankers believe that Indian companies would be able to raise a significant amount from global bond markets in 2022 and RIL’s issue may act as a catalyst. “The phenomenal response to the bond issuance clearly demonstrates the quality of the RIL credit and also evidences that there is tremendous global liquidity available for well-rated Indian issuers, who will be able to get size and tenure,” said Asit Bhatia, Managing Director, Global Corporate and Investment Banking, Bank of America.

RIL raises $4 billion in US dollars. Key highlights of India’s largest forex bond issue

RIL’s issue received a strong subscription in its 30-year bond, even more than the shorter 10-year paper. It raised $1.75 billion from 30-year bonds and $1.5 billion from the 10-year bond. Bankers said that investors such as sovereign wealth funds and insurance and pension funds saw a clear yield advantage with a proven balance sheet.

Further, the uncertainty over the direction of US interest rates is over with the US Federal Reserve indicating that it would reduce its bond-buying sooner and also begin hiking rates. “Rates are relatively stable and there is enough liquidity which investors are happy to deploy into quality credit. The clarity of the Fed’s tone helps investors make investments with conviction,” said Hardik Dalal, Managing Director & Head of Loans and Bonds, Barclays Bank India.

Bhatia agrees, adding that the issuance volume could rival that of 2021. “The RIL issuance sets the tone for the rest of the year. I reckon some high-quality Indian companies will follow suit and tap the market to fund capex and growth requirements,” he said.

What works for Indian companies is the fact that they have deleveraged their balance sheet over the past several years. Further, the earnings performance of large listed Indian companies has been healthy in the past four quarters. Yet another reason is that bonds of Indian companies offer a higher yield compared with many peer emerging market economies. Bankers reckon that the yield advantage of Indian companies will remain intact.

Look out for risks

The 2021 dollar bond issuance is not exactly a celebratory matter. Companies used the bulk of the funds towards retiring old costly bonds and not for capital expenditure or fresh investment. Bankers hope that the current year would be different. Out of the $4 billion raised, RIL intends to use $1.5 billion towards refinancing its old debt.

Then there is the cost factor which is at risk. The cost of dollar borrowing won’t stay cheap for Indian issuers. The yield on benchmark US treasury bonds has spiked in the past few weeks and the US Federal Reserve’s statements have strengthened the expectations of further rise in interest rates.

That would drive up the cost for Indian issuers in the coming months. Dalal believes that for longer durations, issuers should be willing to pay up. The threat of inflation and the beginnings of tightening of monetary policy across geographies may keep the pressure up on interest rates.

RIL’s pricing may not be replicated by other top-rated companies.

That said, the cost may still be lower than the levels seen before the pandemic. “Spreads had compressed in 2020 and the first half of 2021. They have remained steady since then,” points out Dalal of Barclays.

The upshot is Indian companies may continue to find it easy to raise dollars from global markets given that global liquidity won’t drastically reduce. But the price of liquidity is another matter and the use of the funds yet another.

This feature, namely the UPI autopay, would allow Jio customers to set standing instructions on the MyJio app for a hassle-free recharging experience and allow them to seamlessly enjoy their favourite tariff plans.

Hundreds of millions of both Jio prepaid and postpaid customers can now set standing instructions on the MyJio App using UPI autopay for their favourite tariff plans and enjoy hassle-free auto-recharge and bill payment experiences.

Jio’s integration with UPI autopay has made it the first player in the telecom industry to go live with the unique e-mandate feature that was launched by NPCI.

Kunal Kalawatia, Chief of Products - NPCI, said, “We are glad to associate with Jio and witness UPI autopay venturing into the ever-evolving telecom sector. We believe our collaboration will change the way Jio customers experience a renewal of their mobile tariff plans. ""

""With UPI autopay, it’s our constant endeavour at NPCI to provide an extra layer of comfort and convenience to all the customers for their recurring spends and payments. We believe that this integration will drive a favourable customer sentiment about seamless and automated recurring payments.” he added.

The mandate would mean that Jio users will no longer have to remember their recharge or renewal dates, for their chosen plan will be auto-renewed under the UPI autopay feature as and when their plan's validity expires. The users can, per their requirements, also modify, remove, or create the e-mandates.

Also, for executing recharges of up to Rs 5,000, the need to enter a UPI pin to validate the transaction has also been done away with.

Kiran Thomas, Director - Jio, said, “The combination of Jio’s superior prepaid and postpaid plans and UPI autopay will now be available to every Jio user. Jio users will no longer need to remember their recharge renewal date or bill payment date and perform manual payments. This will enable an ALWAYS-ON service experience for every Jio prepaid user.”

Reliance Industries has raised $4 billion in the largest ever foreign currency bond issuance from India. The bond issue was subscribed over three times.

Srikanth Venkatachari, Joint CFO of RIL, said in a statement that the mega issue was the largest debt capital market transaction for the company, and had “the tightest credit spreads across each of the long-dated tenors for any corporate in India.”

“The support received from the marquee international capital market investors is reflective of the strength of our underlying businesses with established growth platforms across energy, consumer and technology as well as robustness of our balance sheet. This issue continues the tradition of Reliance being a sophisticated and innovative issuer across the capital structure,” he added.

The conglomerate’s jumbo note issuance of US dollar bonds was done in three tranches – $1.5 billion for 10 years at 2.875%, $1.75 billion for 30 years at 3.625% and $750 million for 40-year term and 3.750% coupon rate. The proceeds will mainly be used for refinancing existing borrowings. Part of it will go towards refinancing of $1.5 billion worth of debt that is due to mature in February.

The notes have been priced competitively at 120 basis points, 160 basis points and 170 basis points over the respective US Treasuries benchmark. The issue has the lowest coupon achieved for benchmark 30-year and 40-year issuances and is the first ever 40-year tranche by a ‘BBB’ rated private sector corporate from Asia, excluding Japan.

RIL said that the notes received orders from over 200 accounts in Asia, Europe and the United States. “The notes were distributed to high quality fixed income accounts: 69% to fund managers, 24% to insurance companies, 5% to banks and 2% to public institutions,” the company said.

Rating agency Moody’s had rated the bond ‘Baa2’ while S&P Global Rating gave it ‘BBB+’; both had a ‘stable’ outlook on the bonds. The interest on the notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears, and the notes shall rank at par with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of RIL.

RIL did not reveal the name of the investors who subscribed to the bonds. But market sources said that the bidders included– Hong Kong-based BFAM Opportunities Fund, China Life Insurance, Mizuho Bank, Fidelity, Singapore-based UOB Asset Management, among others. A query sent to RIL awaits response.

BofA Securities, Citigroup and HSBC were the joint global coordinators to the issue. BofA Securities, Citigroup, HSBC, Barclays, JP Morgan and MUFG acted as joint active bookrunners. ANZ, BNP PARIBAS, Crédit Agricole CIB, DBS Bank Ltd., Mizuho Securities, SMBC Nikko, Standard Chartered Bank and SBI London Branch were the joint passive bookrunners.

Reliance Industries turned net debt free in June 2020 after it raised Rs 168,818 crore in two months through the country’s largest ever rights issue and series of stake sale deals in its businesses. Experts tracking the sector said that the jumbo fund raising through the US bonds will bring down its cost of funds even more and will make the repayment tenure longer.

At 14:30IST, shares of RIL were trading at Rs 2425.00 on the BSE, down 1.7% from the previous close. The benchmark index Sensex was down 0.8%.

The Delhi High Court on January 3 reserved its order on Future group’s plea seeking termination of the ongoing arbitration proceedings with e-retailer Amazon in the wake of an anti-trust order passed in December 2021. The court will pronounce its order on Future group’s plea at 4.30 PM on January 4, it said.

Considering the arbitration tribunal tasked to decide the dispute between two entities is scheduled to meet on January 5, Future group cited the urgency in its plea and urged the Delhi High Court to hear the case today itself. As such, a single-judge bench of Justice Amit Bansal took up the case for hearing on late-Monday afternoon and reserved its orders after concluding the hearing that lasted nearly three hours.

Kishore Biyani’s Future group approached the Delhi high Court seeking termination of ongoing arbitration proceedings with Amazon in the wake of Competition Commission of India suspending its approval for the 2019 deal between the two entities.

CCI order, Arbitration law, and what Future group and Amazon argued:

The request for such termination was made by Future group before the Singapore tribunal that is hearing the case but the request was not accommodated by the tribunal which then brought Future group before the Delhi High Court, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi representing Future Coupons Pvt Ltd said while explaining the timeline to the high court.

According to Rohatgi, the tribunal, citing its busy schedule, agreed to accommodate Future group’s plea for termination of proceedings after carrying out the main hearing in the case between January 5 and 7 on the issue of damages to be ascertained. “It will be completely illegal, completely in defiance of Indian law and in defiance of CCI procedure,” Rohatgi said referring to tribunal’s decision to proceed with main arbitration proceedings.

Now, before the Delhi High Court, it is Future group’s case that with the CCI approval for the 2019 deal suspended, the investment deal is rendered invalid and the arbitration proceedings arising from the same cannot stand. Rohatgi termed the arbitration proceedings “futile” and “irrelevant” in light of the CCI order.

It is important to note, however, that the CCI has kept the approval for the deal in abeyance and has not quashed it yet. CCI noted that Amazon had hidden important strategic information while seeking approval for its investment in Future Retail’s promoter firm Future Coupons Pvt Ltd. Amazon, which denies any wrong-doing, has also been granted time by CCI to put forth its case and make fresh application for approval following which the commission will reconsider the approval for the deal.

The tribunal set up by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre was reportedly told by Amazon that the company has legal remedies available against the CCI order.

While arguing before the high court, senior advocate Gopal Subramanium representing Amazon highlighted that the position in law outlines that arbitration clauses and agreements are independent of the main contracts and would not perish simply because a regulatory approval has been suspended.

Subramanium also defended the tribunal to say that the tribunal did not reject Future group’s plea to hear termination application altogether but agreed to accommodate hearing on the application after the scheduled hearings. “Any attempt to paint a different picture would be less than fair,” Subramanium said countering Rohatgi’s arguments. The senior counsel added that the schedule for hearing on main case was fixed in November 2021.

“The essence of Arbitration and Conciliation Act is to ensure expeditious adjudication, and the tribunal is cognizant of this,” Subramanium added.

The asset sale deal between India’s two leading retailers was stayed by an emergency arbitrator in October 2020 and the validity of this order was finally affirmed by the Supreme Court in August 2021. While this merger remains stayed, Future group firm moved CCI accusing Amazon of withholding pertinent information leading to the CCI order of December which has now become basis for a fresh round of litigation.

Reliance shares gained 19.3 percent in 2021, while the Nifty climbed 22 percent and the Sensex advanced 24.1 percent.

The stock had declined 5.2 percent in November and 2 percent in December. The fall in the share price came after Reliance Jio Infocomm, the telecom unit, saw a reduction in subscribers and a delay in the launch of JioPhone, a low-cost smartphone. Analysts said the launch of JioPhone Next is unlikely to increase subscribers.

“The new smartphone JioPhone Next plans are less aggressive than we expected,” Morgan Stanley said in a note to investors. “While the subscriber market share increase could be more measured, considering the handset price point, subscriber churns could be lower as well.”

The re-evaluation of a proposed investment in Reliance’s oil-to-chemicals business by Saudi Aramco and Reliance was a sentiment dampener.

“Non-consumption of deals is negative; but we don’t rule out more broad-based partnership in future. Recent stock price correction offers an attractive entry point; we expect multiple value unlocking opportunities at play,” Prabhudas Lilladher said in a note to investors.

Kotak Institutional Equities upgraded the Reliance stock to ‘buy’ from ‘add’ after noting a favourable reward-risk balance following the decline in the shares and the relative sharp underperformance compared with peers in the telecom and retail businesses.

It expects Reliance’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda) to grow at a compound annual rate of 26 percent over the next two years, driven by strength in refining and polyester margins, higher telecom tariffs, robust growth in retailing, and an increase in contributions from the oil exploration and production segment.

It said the stock is set for a re-rating, led by the scaling up of its new commerce and energy ventures. Kotak said the stage is set for further increases in telecom tariffs in the coming years following the recent policy decision to defer adjusted gross revenue and spectrum liabilities payable by telecom companies by four years.

Kotak raised the FY22-24 Ebitda estimates for Jio by 8-23 percent and by 2-10 percent for Reliance (consolidated), factoring in higher average revenue per user along with a modestly lower subscriber base and other minor changes.

Analysts said the 5G spectrum auction and pricing, expected next year, progress in the new energy business with large acquisitions and stake sales to outside investors, and the listing of Jio and retail entities would be the new triggers for the Reliance stock.

A delay in the launch of Jio Payment Bank and the Reliance-Future deal court cases with Amazon are likely to be the main concerns for investors

“We do not see Jio/Retail being listed for the next 18 months at least; stake sales of any other businesses (e-commerce/smaller stake sale in O2C) would be positive. We highlight that e-commerce across segments for Reliance is growing strongly,” JPMorgan said in a note to investors.

Chairman Mukesh Ambani said recently that Reliance will become one of the strongest and most reputed Indian multinational firms in the world in the coming years, propelled by its entry into the clean and green energy sector as well as retail and telecom operations reaching unprecedented heights. Ambani also said it is in the process of effecting a momentous leadership transition.

Even after more than a year since the dispute began, the corporate-legal saga remains on the boil.

The convoluted tussle between the US-based Amazon and Kishore Biyani-led Future group saw many rounds of courtroom battles and has affected several other parties, including an Indian confederation of sellers, a lender, and also another retail giant of India.

The CCI’s order now has kept its approval for the 2019 investment deal between the two companies in abeyance noting that the commission may need to take a fresh look at the arrangement between the parties for approval.

The CCI also said that Amazon made “false and incorrect statements” while seeking the body’s approval for its investment deal with Future group firm Future Coupons Pvt Ltd. The American retailer also “suppressed actual scope” of the arrangement, the antitrust watchdog said, referring to Amazon’s strategic interest in Future group’s listed company Future Retail Ltd.

Through this investment, Amazon acquired not only a 49% stake in Future Coupons but also certain benefits in terms of right of first refusal, among other things. The clauses in the agreement have also placed a ban on the Future group from entering into any deal with a list of entities which included Reliance Industries. It was this clause that Amazon cited while seeking to block the asset sale agreement between India’s top two retailers, Reliance Retail and Future Retail.

The question on the minds of many then is, how does this CCI order affect the legal proceedings and the stalled deal?

CCI order and what it means for Amazon:

Interestingly, while the CCI’s move to keep its previous approval in abeyance is by and large unprecedented, it is pertinent to note that the approval has not been quashed.

The proceedings before CCI took place after Future Coupons Pvt Ltd filed a complaint of wrongdoing against Amazon. This plea urging the CCI to reconsider its approval also found support from the Confederation All India Traders as well as some independent directors of Future Retail. The result of a fresh reconsideration of the 2019 deal may go either way and chances of Amazon securing the approval even after this initial jolt remain 50-50.

In the meantime, however, an appeal may be expected to be filed by Amazon before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal against the CCI’s December 17 ruling as the natural next step. The possibility of Amazon approaching either the Delhi High Court or the Supreme Court directly is slim but cannot be ruled out.

Pending arbitration proceedings before SIAC:

The CCI order will not have a direct impact on the international arbitration proceedings pending before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre between Amazon and Future group. The tribunal, which is scheduled to meet in January, has full discretion to proceed with or pause the proceedings after the development of December 17 is made known to it.

The tribunal is tasked with deciding the dispute concerning the impending Future-Reliance merger in the light of the Amazon-Future deal of 2019 and the specific clause barring Future from dealing with Reliance Industries. A suspension of approval by one Indian regulator may not preclude the tribunal from deciding the dispute before it in accordance with the arbitration laws and the arbitration agreement that both Amazon and Future group consented to back in 2019.

It has been seen in the past in the same case that the observations and findings of an Indian court have little bearing on proceedings before the tribunal. Despite the findings of a single-judge bench of the Delhi High Court noting, in December 2020, that the agreement between Amazon and Future Coupons cannot be conflated with the agreement Future Coupons has with Future Retail in the capacity of its promoter, the SIAC tribunal ruled to hold Future Retail a valid party to the agreement with Amazon.

Frozen merger between Future group and Reliance:

The CCI’s order does nothing to “de-freeze” the asset sale deal between the top two retailers of India even as Future Retail struggles to keep afloat.

This deal, which was stayed by an emergency arbitrator under the SIAC proceedings in October 2020, subsequently received almost all the requisite regulatory approvals in India on applications by Future Retail. The move by the Biyani camp to seek these approvals despite the tribunal’s stay did not hold ground before the court, though.

The Delhi High Court’s single-judge bench had rebuked Future group and its key managerial persons for wilfully disobeying the tribunal’s order. An appeal against this order remains pending. Over at SIAC, the emergency tribunal’s stay on the deal was affirmed by the duly constituted tribunal which is now holding regular proceedings.

In the light of the Supreme Court’s judgment of August 2021, no authority or regulatory body can pass any final orders concerning the Future group-Reliance merger deal till the issue is resolved in arbitration.

Shri Rajeev Chandrashekhar ji,

Shri Devusinh Chauhan ji,

Shri K Rajaraman ji,

Dr S P Kochhar

My good friends from the industry – Shri Sunil Mittal and Shri Kumar Mangalam Birla,

Distinguished delegates



Ladies and Gentlemen, a very warm good morning.

I want to congratulate the DoT and the COAI for hosting the fifth edition of the Indian Mobile Congress.

In a very short time, the Indian Mobile Congress has emerged as a prestigious platform for impact-making interaction among all the stakeholders in the industry.

This is because of the visionary leadership provided by our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji.

Because of our Prime Minister’s vision and mission, India has seen a spectacular transformation of the mobile and digital landscape since 2014.

Honourable Minister and Friends,

This conference is taking place at a crucial juncture in India’s post-COVID recovery.

On one hand, India is making phenomenal progress in its COVID-19 vaccination campaign.

And on the other hand, it is stepping up efforts to get the economy back on the high growth track.

Also read: 5G rollout should be India’s national priority: Mukesh Ambani

Our industry’s contribution to the success of these two gigantic tasks has been pivotal.

I am supremely confident that India will not only succeed in containing any future wave of COVID, but also stage a rapid economic comeback that will astonish the world.

My conviction is based on a good reason.

India has fundamentally redefined its relationship with technology in the past few years — especially since the outbreak of the pandemic.

Indians have embraced technology with unbridled optimism.

During COVID, when the chips were down, it is the chipsets that kept us going.

When COVID-induced lockdowns rocked our boats, it is technology that kept our lives and livelihoods afloat.

Work from Home, Study from Home, Pay from Home, Shop from Home...all this became common because of the world-class digital technology infrastructure created by our industry. 9

Friends,

The theme of this conference is ‘Connectivity for the next Decade’. I would like to place before all of you five ideas related to this theme.

My first idea is: India must complete the migration from 2G to 4G to 5G at the earliest.

To keep millions of Indians at the bottom of the socio-economic pyramid confined to 2G is to deprive them of the benefits of the digital revolution.

My second idea is: Roll-out of 5G should be India’s national priority.

At Jio, we are currently focused on 4G and 5G execution and broadband infrastructure expansion.

We have developed a 100% home-grown and comprehensive 5G solution which is fully cloud native and digitally managed.

Because of our converged, future-proof architecture, Jio's network could be quickly and seamlessly upgraded from 4G to 5G.

My third idea is: We should not lose sight of the fact that affordability has been a critical driver of the phenomenally rapid expansion of the mobile subscriber base in India.

India should move towards greater digital inclusion, and not greater digital exclusion.

When we talk of affordability in the policy context, we only think of affordability of services.

Actually, India needs to ensure affordability not only of services, but also of devices and applications.

The best way of ensuring comprehensive affordability is nimble adoption of futuristic technologies and supportive policy tools like use of the USO fund for purposes other than services. USO fund can be used to subsidise devices to select target groups.

My fourth idea is: Ubiquitous Fibre Connectivity should be completed across India on a mission mode.

This is because the world is now transitioning into a DIGITAL FIRST ERA, when almost everything will be done in the digital space first, and then translated into the physical world.

The paradigm of economic activities and even social interactions will change dramatically.

Virtual will become as important as real or Actual.

Wealth creation will not only be accelerated but will also become inclusive.

Indeed, adoption of the FIRST strategy, coupled with our demographic strength, will enable India to outperform most other countries.

This will necessitate increase in data carriage beyond anything we can now imagine.

Fibre has almost unlimited data carriage capacity.

Therefore, to be future-ready, India has to be fiber-ready.

Even during these Covid times, Jio was able to introduce Fibre to Home to 5 million homes.

If all the players in the industry work together, we can rapidly achieve a nationwide footprint of Fibre, just as we reached mobile telephony to every corner of the country in the last decade.

My fifth idea is: that, beyond connectivity, we should focus on the critical components of the digital eco-system which are necessary for India’s digital transformation.

The Government is putting in place a sound regulatory and policy framework for this.

This has helped thousands of young Indian entrepreneurs and start-ups create platforms, applications and solutions that can accelerate India’s digital transformation.

We are already seeing innovative solutions in Education, Financial Services, Entertainment, Retail, Agriculture, Manufacturing and other key verticals of the economy.

The National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) under the visionary leadership of our Prime Minister is set to transform the landscape of healthcare in India.

Another candidate for radical transformation is India’s energy systems.

Technologies are maturing for energy saving through smart grids, decarbonisation of the economy, and drastic reduction in cost of India’s transition to clean and green energy.

All this shows that CARE FOR THE PEOPLE and CARE FOR THE PLANET are embedded in the gigantic transformation our industry has initiated.

Distinguished Friends,

Our industry can take legitimate pride in the fact that we have democratized the Mobile and Digital Revolution in India.

Now we are ready to democratize digitally enabled development, so that its fruits can be enjoyed by all the 1.35 billion Indians.

We are determined to transform India as a premier Digital Society, with the ease of living and the ease of doing business, which are comparable to advanced countries in the world.

I end my remarks by pledging that we stand fully committed to realizing this mission and mandate of our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji.

Thank you and a very warm good morning to each and everyone of you.

The Supreme Court (SC), on November 23, deferred the hearing in the legal tussle between Amazon and Future group of companies on account of the inconvenience caused by the voluminous documents placed on record by the parties.

The Chief Justice of India led bench of the top court questioned both the sides over filing bulky volumes of documents ranging to over 20 compilations under the name of “convenience compilation”.

Directing both sides to file a smaller number of documents, the court adjourned the hearing to December 8.

During the hearing on November 23, Amazon told the apex court that it had also challenged the recent order passed by the Delhi High Court - directing the Competition Commission of India to decide on a plea filed by the Confederation of All India Traders within two weeks.

The CAIT has sought revocation of approval granted to Amazon on its deal with Future group back in 2019. The CCI was scheduled to take up the matter for consideration on Jan 4, however, the window for this was reduced to two weeks after the high court’s decision.

The SC, in no uncertain terms said today that now all legal cases involving Amazon or Future group companies can be clubbed together and the specific case concerning the CCI approval on CAIT’s plea will be heard separately. This appeal is expected to come up for hearing later this week.

Future group moved the apex court earlier in November challenging a Singapore Tribunal’s decision to freeze the asset sale deal between two of India’s largest retailers – Future Retail and Reliance Industries (RIL).

On the other hand, US e-retailer, Amazon, relied on the same arbitration award and has urged the apex court to stay the permission granted by the Mumbai bench of National Company Law Tribunal to Future Retail and Reliance Retail to hold shareholder meetings to discuss the merger deal.

The top court had agreed to hear both the pleas when they came up for hearing earlier this month.

The dispute between Amazon and Future group dates back to 2019 when the American retailer had made an investment in one of the Future group firms – Future Coupons Pvt Ltd. The agreement spelled out a prohibitory clause which barred Future coupons from entering into any business with a host of entities including the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani group.

When Future Coupons and Kishore Biyani led public listed company Future Retail announced an asset sale deal with Reliance Industries wholly owned subsidiary Reliance Retail Pvt Ltd, Amazon invoked arbitration and objected to the merger citing its agreement with Future Coupons.

In October last year, an emergency arbitrator passed an award staying the merger which kicked off a long first leg of litigation in Indian courts where the validity of this award was under challenge.

At the highest forum, the SC - earlier in 2021 - held that the emergency award is valid under the Indian law of arbitration and restored the Delhi High Court’s order which had found Biyanis and the key managerial persons in Future group to be in wilful violation of the emergency award. The apex court had also barred all fora and regulators from passing any final orders to give effect to the contested merger.

Meanwhile, a duly constituted arbitration panel affirmed what was ruled by the emergency arbitrator and held that Future Retail is a valid party to the agreement between Future Coupons and Amazon which has now kicked off a second round of litigation in Indian courts.

The letter to the Competition Commission of India asking it to revoke the approval to the November 2019 Amazon-Future Coupons deal was triggered by a ruling of the Singapore arbitrator, Ravindra Dhariwal, an independent director of Future Retail, told Moneycontrol in an interview. He and other independent directors had sent the letter on 8 November 2021.

In an October 2021 ruling, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) had ruled that Future Retail is a party to the case between Amazon and Future Group, rejecting the retail company’s request to be excluded from the arbitration proceedings. The SIAC, while hearing the dispute between Amazon and Future Group, said that the three commercial agreements between Amazon and Future Coupons must be read together and not separately.

The three agreements referred to a) the deal between Future Retail, Future Coupons and certain promoter entities of the Future Group under which the retail firm was required to get the nod of Future Coupons for selling its assets, among other things; b) a share subscription agreement for Amazon to invest Rs 1431 to buy 49 percent of Future Coupons and c) a shareholder agreement under which Future Coupons had to take Amazon’s consent before it okayed any proposal of Future Retail.

“We were always led to believe that the three agreements are to be read separately and cannot be linked together but with the recent ruling by SIAC, we realised this is not the case and hence decided to bring the issue to the notice of CCI,” said Dhariwal.

If the three agreements are read together, they give Amazon veto powers over Future Retail without owing any shares of the listed company. Future Coupons holds 9.8 percent in Future Retail.

Further, they violate foreign exchange and foreign direct investment (FDI) rules of India. A foreign entity cannot hold a stake in a multi-brand retail company without government approval. Moreover, as this combination deal amounts to the control of Future Retail changing hands to Amazon, it would trigger an open offer under SEBI norms.

The Singapore arbitrator came into the picture when Amazon blocked the deal between Future Retail and Reliance saying it had a prior agreement with the Future Group that entitled the company to pick up a stake in Future Retail between three to ten years. SIAC had passed an interim verdict blocking the deal last year.

In tribunals and courts, Amazon had presented the three agreements as a single and integrated transaction that intended to give it special and material strategic rights over Future Retail, the letter said.

To the competition regulator, however, Amazon had misrepresented its strategic intent in Future Retail while seeking approval of the deal and claimed that its rights over Future Retail were only investment protection rights, the letter added.

“Amazon had actually deposed before the Competition Commission of India (CCI) that they were investing in Future Coupons and were absolutely silent on Future Retail. They (the authorities) are realising Amazon has control (over Future Retail) and ought to have sought approval because it is against FDI, FEMA laws of the country,” said Dhariwal.

The recent ruling has made the authorities realise that Amazon, a foreign entity, has control over Future Retail and they have started investigating the matter, said Dhariwal. He confirmed that the Enforcement Directorate has asked Future Coupons to submit all documents related to its deal with Amazon.

Dhariwal also said that while CCI was aware of the misrepresentation of the facts by Amazon and had pulled up the company in July as reported by Moneycontrol, it is now realising the full extent of violation with the SIAC ruling.

“It is only after the tribunal award came that the CCI realised that Amazon is representing the three agreements as integrated,” he added.

According to Dhariwal while the legal tussle is going on and the court will decide on the technicalities of the deal, independent directors are concerned about the company which has been built over many years.

“Our concern is how we save this business,” he added. “We had cleared the deal (with Amazon) as we had no option, and would have faced default. We had borrowed money from the banks, lenders and nobody was giving us credits. As independent directors, our fiduciary responsibilities are first and foremost,” he adds.

Future Retail is on the verge of bankruptcy and owes almost Rs 30,000 crore in debt to the lenders, the letter said.",738,-0.8515183478593826

""The JioPhone Next is an affordable smartphone designed for India, inspired by the belief that everyone in India should benefit from the opportunities the internet creates"" Pichai said.

Google also shared additional details on the operating system that will power the smartphone, which has been co-developed with Reliance.

Called Pragati OS, the operating system is based on Android Go operating system, a stripped down version of the Android operating system designed for entry-level smartphones. On October 29, Reliance announced that the made-for-India smartphone will be available for an entry price of Rs 1,999, with the remaining amount paid via the company's easy EMI over 18 or 24 months. The smartphone can also be bought upfront for Rs 6,499.

In an official blogpost, Ram Papatla - GM & India Engineering Lead, Android said they worked closely with Jio to create this operating system with capabilities built to cater to the diverse needs of the Indian consumer.

This includes read-aloud and language translation for any on-screen text in 10 Indian languages and voice-first features that will also enable people to consume content and navigate the phone in their language of choice.

Google has partnered with Snap Inc to integrate India-specific Snapchat Lenses directly into the phone's camera app Camera Go to provide a better photo-taking experience for users. The high-quality camera will also include features such as night mode, Portrait mode and HDR mode.

JioPhone Next will also include Android's ‘Nearby Share’ feature that will allow users to quickly share apps, photos, videos, music and other content from their devices.

Apart from this, users will have access to Google Play Store along with over the air updates support for new features, customization, and Android security updates with built-in Google Play Protect among others.

""We are actively expanding our Android product and engineering presence in India, where we will continue to focus on building new experiences in close collaboration with our global engineering teams aimed at the millions of new users coming online,"" Papatla said.

Reliance Industries (RIL) shares traded marginally lower on the National Stock Exchange on October 25, as the Nifty 50 index, too, declined, although analysts are broadly pleased with the company’s September quarter results announced on October 22.

They were especially satisfied with Reliance’s retail business, where revenue surpassed pre-pandemic levels. The easing of the second Covid-19 wave’s restrictions meant that the retail segment recovered as demand improved.

Core retail year-on-year revenue growth stood at 16 percent in Q2. Footfalls recovered to 78 percent of pre-pandemic level compared with 46 percent in Q1. Analysts expect footfalls to improve as consumer sentiment improves, provided a potential third covid wave doesn’t hit the country and stall business recovery.

Emkay Global Financial Services analysts assigned a higher multiple for RIL’s retail business in keeping with its peers.

Also read: RIL Q2 earnings: Should you buy, sell, or hold the stock?

“Our revised enterprise value for RIL’s 84 percent stake in retail stands at Rs 5.97 trillion (Rs 4.83 trillion earlier), based on 40 times December 2023 estimated EBITDA (36 times June 2023 estimated EBITDA earlier),” Emkay Global Financial Services said in a report on October 24. EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) is a key measure of profitability for companies.

Target price

The broker increased its target price by 18 percent to Rs 2,750 but retained its ‘hold’ rating. Reliance shares traded at about Rs 2,620 on the NSE after closing at Rs 2,627.40 on October 22.

“Our target price increase is driven by rollover, higher multiple for retail (based on peers), introduction of new energy in SoTP (based on announced invested capital), higher GRMs, and lower debt,” Emkay’s analysts said.

SoTP refers to the Sum-of-The-Parts valuation methodology where the value of each division is ascertained separately and added together to arrive at the total value of the firm.

There is a fair share of excitement over the strong rebound in gross refining margins (GRM), the amount refiners earn from turning each barrel of crude oil into fuel products. Improving demand on the lifting of pandemic-led restrictions on travel unsurprisingly have a positive influence on refining margins.

“We project RIL’s refining margins at $11.5 per barrel and $12 per barrel over FY23 and FY24 (up 89% and 97% over FY21), driven by demand recovery and supply rationalisation/delays in planned capacity additions,” Morgan Stanley Research said in a report on October 25.

Reliance’s oil-to-chemical business revenue grew 58 percent YoY in Q2 mainly on account of better realisations driven by the increase in oil prices and higher volumes. The segment’s EBITDA rose by about 44 percent YoY and 4 percent quarter-on-quarter.

RIL’s oil and gas segment performed well, too, although telecom unit Jio’s net subscriber additions were muted. Overall, RIL’s consolidated EBITDA increased by 11 percent to Rs 26,020 crore in Q2 vis-à-vis the June quarter. EBITDA growth stood at 37 percent YoY.

To be sure, the outlook for many of Reliance’s segments is on a strong footing. Investors seem to be capturing a good portion of the optimism into the share price. RIL’s shares have appreciated as much as 32 percent so far this calendar year. This may cap significant upsides from a near-term perspective.

“As key segments (oil-to-chemicals, retail, Jio) are reflecting premium valuations, in our view, further rerating would have to come from a higher renewables option value,” JP Morgan India analyst Pinakin Parekh wrote in a report on October 23. “We currently build in around $10 billion in renewable option value.”

Additionally, investors should keep a close eye on news flow about the oil-to-chemicals stake sale to Saudi Aramco.

JioPhone Next - the latest from the Reliance stable in partnership with Google - is set to the hit the market before Diwali.

The ultra-affordable 4G handset was unveiled by Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani and Google CEO Sundar Pichai at RIL's annual general meeting (AGM) on June 24, 2021. During the unveiling, Ambani said that the JioPhone Next will be the “most affordable smartphone” in the world.

Reliance recently shared some details about the JioPhone Next and how it has worked with Google to deliver a made-in-India smartphone.

The phone is aimed at helping India’s estimated 300 million 2G users shift to 4G without breaking the bank. The smartphone is powered by an “extremely optimised version” of the Android operating system, jointly developed by Google and Jio and tailored for the Indian market.

The JioPhone Next comes with features like automatic read-aloud of screen text, language translation, smart camera with augmented reality filters, and voice assistant. Google has also worked closely with the Jio team on engineering and product development on voice-first features that enable JioPhone Next users to consume content and navigate the OS in their own language, deliver a great camera experience, and get the latest Android feature and security updates.

The phone was initially scheduled to arrive in India on September 10 on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, but was delayed due to the global semiconductor shortage.

JioPhone Next Expected Specs

The JioPhone Next is rumoured to be powered by the Snapdragon 215 SoC paired with a 2GB RAM, although a 3GB RAM variant may also be on the cards. The phone could also get 16GB and 32GB storage options with room for expansion via a microSD card. It is also set to sport a 5.5-inch HD+ display with a 720x1, 440 pixels resolution and a 320dpi screen density.

For optics, the JioPhone Next is also expected to use a 13MP single rear camera and an 8MP front camera. It will pack a 2,500 mAh battery with charging over a micro-USB port. The device will run on Android 11 (Go Edition) rather than KaiOS.

The JioPhone Next’s price in India is likely to start from Rs 3,499.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

This was during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic that has been terrorising the world and most, if not all countries had issued lockdowns and public restrictions to contain the spread of the virus.

At the recently-concluded AGM, the sheer number of virtual attendees at more than 3.8 lakh proves the scalability of the app when it comes to conferencing. A statement released by Reliance reads, “It was a proud moment for the team JioMeet to have successfully completed an event of this scale. This reemphasized on the world class engineering which has gone in making JioMeet so scalable and flexible.”

The statement further adds, “JioMeet is already one of India’s most favorite video conferencing app with HD quality Audio and Video and how it has been built for Indian conditions. JioMeet has made huge in-roads into both retail and enterprise segments.”

JioMeet has also been undergoing upgrades and has been adding features to better suit a conferencing environment in India. For example, along with a classroom and whiteboard mode, there is support for the Hindi language as well as support coming in the form of Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada.

The JioMeet app is available on all platforms like Android and iOS as well as Mac, Windows and even for Set Top Boxes and has support for VC room connectivity.

We have all been there, rushing to send an email to your boss just as the mobile data plan runs out and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere. Better yet, how about an intense session of Battlegrounds Mobile being interrupted by low data.

Good news for Jio users though, the company has launched a new facility that lets its prepaid customers avail some extra data that can be paid for at a later stage. These plans come in packs ranging from 1GB to 5GB.

The 1GB pack is valued at Rs 11 and can be availed till the expiry of your base plan. The important thing to note is that you need a prepaid base plan active in order for this to work.

How to avail Jio emergency data loan?

The first thing you need to do is have the MyJio app installed on the phone, if it isn't already. Your profile also needs to be setup, which is a fairly easy process.

Once you have done that, open the app and click on the three lines on the top left of the home screen. From there, select 'Emergency Data Loan' which will be a sub-option under 'Mobile'.

Then tap proceed and select 'Get Emergency Data'. Finally tap on 'Activate'.

You do not need to pay for this immediately and you can only withdraw a maximum of 5GB as emergency data, so its better to save it in cases of emergency.

The Reliance research and development (R&D) team has proposed that Niclosamide -- the drug used to treat tapeworm infestation be used to treat COVID-19 patients. The company has submitted a proposal for the administration of Niclosamide as a potential drug against COVID-19.

A study conducted by a team of researchers at the University Hospital in Trieste, Italy, had found Niclosamide to be effective in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In the study, they had explained how the drug can help fight the deadly pathogen.

This tapeworm drug was also used on SARS patients during the 2004 outbreak.

The Government of India has already given clearance to conduct Phase two clinical trials of Niclosamide for COVID-19 treatment.

The Reliance R&D team is also working with various Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) laboratories to certify Nexar polymer, which has been found to be effective in destroying the lipid layer of various viruses and bacteria.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Leveraging its intellectual capital to help the nation tackle the COVID-19 crisis, Reliance has developed novel cost-effective diagnostic kits called ‘R-Green’ and ‘R-Green Pro’ for COVID-19 detection. Both kits have received approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

The company has further designed a process to produce sanitisers aligned with World Health Organization (WHO) specifications at 20 percent of the market rate.

Additionally, it is working on addressing insufficient ventilator supply in emergency rooms across hospitals in India by deploying a concept developed in Italy, which enables CPAP machine with a 3D-printed charlotte valve and special snorkeling mask.

Foreseeing a significant rise in the demand for onsite oxygen in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic, Reliance started working on a value-engineered robust design for oxygen generators too. These oxygen generators are capable of producing five to seven litres of oxygen per minute with a purity of 90-95 percent.

“Spectrum augmentation of this magnitude will certainly help improve the network experience manifold for the entire Jio subscriber base in Karnataka,” the company said in a release. The telco claims to have over 2.1 crore subscriber base in Karnataka.

The company had acquired the right to use spectrum in all 22 circles across India in 850MHZ, 1800MHZ, and 2300MHZ bands, respectively, in the March spectrum auctions conducted by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), at a cost of Rs 57,123 crore for a period of 20 years.

“As on date, Jio has gone ahead with the deployment of all the three spectrums across all 22.3K sites spread across the state.. With this, the total bandwidth available for usage in 850 MHz will be doubled & 2300 MHz will be enhanced by 25%,” the release added

The company said its move will help many including professionals working from home, students to attend classes online, businesses running from home, to seamlessly carry out their activities while being safe at home. Owing to the increasing demand for more 4G towers, Jio Karnataka is expanding its 4G network by 28% in 2021, it added.

“Jio currently has 426 million subscribers and with the enhanced spectrum footprint, RJIL will enhance network capacity to service its existing users.

Friends

Ladies and gentlemen,

A very good evening to each and every one of you!

My hearty congratulations to the entrepreneurs who have won the EY Awards this year.As I look at the India of today and tomorrow, I see a tsunami of opportunities for entrepreneurs.

There are two reasons for my confidence.

Firstly, our Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has been advocating a greater role for the private sector in India’s future development. All of us should welcome this.

Secondly, we now have the revolutionary power of new technologies to transform our economy. A small, medium and big businesses have once in a lifetime opportunity to meet the needs and aspirations of 1.3 billion people for good quality of life.

We have the potential in the coming decades to be among top three economies of the world.

New sectors like Clean Energy, Education, Healthcare, Lifesciences & Biotechnology and transformation of existing agricultural, industrial, and service sectors offer unprecedented opportunities.

Moreover, Indian entrepreneurs are now capable of providing world beating quality to meet the needs of our market at the most competitive cost. This opens-up the entire global market for Indian entrepreneurs.

Hence, Indian entrepreneurs have dual opportunities, first, to serve the domestic markets and then the global markets.

Today, our country is going to be the epicentre of global growth and transformation.

India’s Rise has already begun.

India is surging ahead …

…As an Economic Power.

…As a Democratic Power.

…As a Diplomatic and Strategic Power.

…As a Cultural Power.

And also, as a Digital and Technology Power.

And the key driving force of INDIA’S RISE will be our entrepreneurs,

…who are striving to scale and globalize their businesses;

…who are inventing new things every day that can transform India and the world;…who are disruptive and hungry for success.

My Dear Entrepreneurs,Many of you have started new businesses. Therefore, I would like to share one personal learning with you.

Start-up entrepreneurs must be ready to work with limited resources but with unlimited determination.

My young friends, my message is not to be deterred by failure, because only after many failures there is success. I am sure as an entrepreneur you will have the courage and the determination to succeed. Therefore, I am absolutely confident that you are going to script far bigger success stories for India then the entrepreneurs of my generation.

All the best to you as you pursue your dreams.

May God bless you!

Stay safe. Stay healthy. Thank you.

A ""tsunami of opportunities"" exists for entrepreneurs in India, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani said on March 25, in his keynote address at the EY Entrepreneur of the Year (EOY) India 2020 awards.

""We have the potential in the coming decades to be among top three economies of the world,"" Ambani said, as he lauded the Indian government for advocating a ""greater role"" for the private sector.

The adoption of new technologies in various sectors of the economy has also maximised the scope for entrepreneurs, he added.

""As I look at the India of today and tomorrow, I see a tsunami of opportunities for entrepreneurs,"" Ambani said.

""We now have the revolutionary power of new technologies to transform our economy. A small, medium and big businesses have once in a lifetime opportunity to meet the needs and aspirations of 1.3 billion people for good quality of life,"" the RIL chief added.

The virtual meeting is scheduled for noon and will be chaired by Guruprasad Mohapatra, Secretary of the Department of Promotion for Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). Apart from the players mentioned above, the meeting will also have representatives from Snapdeal, Paytm Mall, Swiggy, Zomato, Urban Ladder, Pepperfry, Urban Clap, Grofers, Big Basket, and Shopclues.

The Government has also been meeting various stakeholders, including industry bodies and traders, on the soon-to-be-unveiled draft e-commerce policy. It also held an inter-ministerial meeting recently on issues related to discounts offered on online marketplaces and preferential treatment given to select sellers.

Both the issues, FDI in e-commerce and the draft policy for the sector, are being discussed simultaneously by the government. According to a leaked copy of the draft seen by Moneycontrol, the policy says online marketplaces cannot be partial to any of their sellers and they cannot use algorithms to the advantage of certain vendors.

One such stakeholder meeting between FICCI and DPIIT last week saw an unexpected twist, with the industry chamber issuing a statement that it did not stand by the statement of its co-chair, who represented it at the meeting. An Amazon official had represented FICCI but the latter said that his views represent only a section of its e-commerce members.

“Any policy must be strictly implemented in letter and spirit and the law of the land has to be strictly abided by any company be it foreign or Indian, big or small. However, if the government or authorities feel that any company, irrespective of their ownership, is found violating the law, the government may speak with them directly and take appropriate action. FICCI supports effective implementation of the FDI policy,"" Uday Shankar, President, FICCI, said in a letter written to Mohapatra hours after the meeting.

This is not the first time the government is trying to address the issue of FDI in e-commerce. In 2018, it introduced Press Note 2, which was a clarification on the existing Press Note 3. The Press Note 2 barred e-commerce players from selling products from sellers in which it had an equity stake. Companies such as Amazon and Flipkart later rejigged their structure to comply with these norms. Currently, the rules only allow foreign e-commerce players to operate as a marketplace, prohibiting them from owning inventory of goods and selling it directly.",433,

The Future Group on March 20 approached the Delhi High Court challenging a single judge's order upholding the Singapore's Emergency Arbitrator's (EA) order restraining Future Retail Ltd (FRL) from going ahead with its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail to sell its business, which was objected to by US-based e-commerce giant Amazon.

The appeal by FRL, Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) will be heard on March 22 by a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh.

The appeal, filed through advocate Harshvardhan Jha, has challenged the single judge's March 18 judgment directing Kishore Biyani-led FRL not to take further action in relation to the deal with Reliance and holding that the group willfully violated the Singapore Arbitrator's order. Justice JR Midha had rejected all the objections raised by Future Group and imposed a cost of Rs 20 lakh on the Future Group and its directors and directed them to deposit the amount in Prime Minister's Relief Fund within two weeks for being used for providing COVID-19 vaccination to senior citizens of Below Poverty Line (BPL) category of Delhi.

The March 18 verdict had come on Amazon's plea seeking direction to order enforcement of the award by Singapore's EA on October 25, 2020, restraining FRL from going ahead with its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail. The HC, which directed the presence of Biyani and others before it on April 28, had also ordered attachment of their properties and asked them to file an affidavit detailing their assets as on today within one month. It had also asked them to show cause as to why they be not detained under civil prison for a term not exceeding three months for violating the emergency arbitrator's order and file reply within two weeks.

The single judge Bench, which has listed the matter for April 28 for reporting compliance of its order, had held that the EA is an arbitrator for all intents and purposes and he had rightly invoked the 'Group of Companies' doctrine in relation to the Future Group companies. It had said the respondents have raised a vague plea of nullity without substantiating the same and it was done to mislead this Court. It had also directed the Future Group to approach authorities for recalling the approvals granted for the FRL-Reliance deal and also asked them not to violate the EA's October 25 last year order.

The Delhi High Court had also asked the Future Group to place on record the details of action taken by it in connection with the Reliance deal after the October 25, 2020 order. Amazon, in its interim plea, had sought to restrain FRL from taking any steps to complete the transaction with entities that are a part of the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (MDA) Group.

Future Group and Amazon have been engaged in a battle after the US-based company took FRL into the emergency arbitration over alleged breach of a contract between them. Justice Midha had earlier, in an interim order, directed FRL to maintain status quo in relation to its deal with Reliance. However, it was stayed by the division bench of the high court.

Amazon challenged the division bench's order before the Supreme Court where the plea is pending. Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, in its plea, had also sought detention of the Biyanis, directors of Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) and FRL and other related parties in civil prison and attaching of their properties for alleged ""wilful disobedience"" of the emergency arbitrator's order.

Amazon had also sought to restrain Future Group from taking any steps to transfer or dispose of FRL's retail assets or the shares held in FRL by the Biyanis in any manner without prior written consent of Amazon. The three domestic firms — FRL, FCPL and Reliance — however had contended that if Amazon's claim — that it indirectly invested in FRL by investing in FCL — was accepted then it would amount to a violation of Indian foreign direct investment laws which permit only 10 percent investment by a foreign entity in the multi-brand retail sector.

In August last year, Future had reached an agreement to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to Reliance. The SIAC on October 25 last year, had passed an interim order in favour of Amazon barring FRL from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.

Subsequently, Amazon wrote to SEBI, stock exchanges and Competition Commission of India, urging them to take into consideration the Singapore arbitrator's interim decision as it is a binding order, FRL had earlier told the high court.

Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries has set the ball rolling for an important internal recast, which involves the demerger of its cash cow oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business into an independent subsidiary, as India's most valuable firm looks to unlock value for shareholders and embrace new-age businesses to boost growth in the next decade.

The move comes at a time when there is a global clarion call for a shift to sustainable energy and follows a blitzkrieg of fundraising in a pandemic hit 2020 when RIL raised a whopping $27 billion for its digital and retail verticals to deleverage its balance sheet. Below is an account of the significance of the move, answering some vital questions.

WHAT'S THE TRIGGER FOR THE CARVEOUT?

The creation of a separate arm housing the O2C business with a dedicated management team sets the stage for the induction of strategic global investors who are keen to tap the massive Indian market, which is still seen as a growth hub for the next decade with Europe shrinking.

Sitting at the top of that pile of potential investors is the world's largest oil exporter—the Middle East giant Saudi Aramco. In August 2019, the oil-to-retail conglomerate announced plans to divest a 20 percent stake to Aramco in the O2C business at an enterprise value of $75 billion.

After briefly hitting a pause button due to the pandemic, talks between both parties are believed to be back on track.

RIL, which has seen a recovery in its petrochemical margins and refining business, plans to gradually reduce its carbon footprint and be net carbon zero by 2035. The O2C business is looking to invest in next-generation carbon capture and storage technologies to convert CO2 into useful products and chemicals.

These plans are in sync with the vision of Saudi Aramco, which wants to diversify its energy mix and emerge as a force to reckon with in clean energy. The tone was set at the recent annual Davos gathering where many global industrial powerhouses pledged their allegiance to a set of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance ) goals.

""New-age investors will chase new-age businesses. The group has many different businesses right now and getting the right global investor subset for the right business is critical, hence this move. RIL's cost competitiveness in the 02C segment is mind-boggling and this will continue to be a powerful, cash-generating vertical for them,"" says an industry observer, who has closely tracked the group for over a decade, requesting anonymity.

WHAT WILL A NEW INVESTOR GET IN THE O2C BIZ?

RIL is widely respected for its prowess at backward integration and is arguably the only company globally with integration from oil to polymers, chemicals, polyesters, and elastomers. The O2C business has high-quality, technologically advanced assets and boasts of the largest single-site crude refinery complex globally. RIL is also the largest petcoke gasifier globally, the largest global producer of PX (para-xylene), and has 12 manufacturing facilities in India and three in Malaysia.

The O2C business also includes a 51:49 joint venture with British Petroleum (BP) that includes a retail service station network and aviation stations. The plan is to hit 5,500 retail outlets in the next five years from the existing portfolio of around 1,400 outlets.

Importantly, according to the official announcement, management control of the O2C business will continue to remain with RIL and the firm expects regulatory approvals for the demerger (which will not impact its consolidated financial position) to be secured by Q2FY22. The deal will result in O2C cash flows optimized to fund its own growth along with efficient upstreaming of cash to RIL.

DOES THIS PAVE THE WAY FOR A NEW-LOOK RIL?

Yes. Looking ahead, RIL is betting on four high-growth engines to drive value creation. Firstly, the O2C business where it expects growth from high-value downstream chemicals and materials. Secondly, Digital (which includes Jio) where connectivity and scaling up of digital platforms will be key. Thirdly, Retail where consumer-led growth will look to leverage technology and an omni-channel presence and finally New Material & Energy, which will focus on clean, green and affordable energy.

The fourth growth pillar i.e clean energy is critical as back in September 2019, at the United Nations Climate Action Summit, India had hiked its renewable energy target to 450 GW by 2030 from 175 GW by 2022.

The clear demarcation of separate growth engines is also being perceived on the street as a step towards eventual succession planning by Mukesh Ambani, especially with Isha, Akash and Anant, heirs to the Reliance empire, already taking up various roles at group companies.

Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail, which are backed by marquee investors ranging from Facebook and Google to KKR & Silver Lake are believed to be candidates for blockbuster IPOs in the next two to three years.

WHAT'S THE MARKET FEEDBACK?

The markets gave a thumbs-up to the demerger roadmap as the RIL stock perked up in early trade on February 23.

A brokerage note by Morgan Stanley titled: ""The Decade Ahead -II: Green RIL"" said, ""RIL's demerger plan for Oil to Chemicals (O2C) business is a step towards monetisation and acceleration of its new energy and material plans into batteries, hydrogen, renewables and carbon capture - all of which point to the next leg of multiple expansion and clarity on the next investment cycle.""

Out of a 10-year capital outlay of $50 to $60 billion, Morgan Stanley expects new energy (Renewable/Battery/other fuels) to bag $13 billion to $15 billion, digital to get $12 billion -$15 billion, followed by retail at $12 billion-$14 billion, chemicals at $8.5 billion to $10.5 billion and finally plastic recycling to get $0.5 billion to $1.5 billion.

RIL 2.0 in the making? Undoubtedly, yes!

Amid ongoing farmer protests in the country, Reliance Jio towers in Punjab were vandalised by protesters. According to reports, close to 1,500 towers of Jio were destroyed disrupting its services in the state.

In a statement on January 4, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) said it has moved the Punjab High Court through its subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (RJIL), seeking urgent intervention of authorities concerned “to bring a complete stop to the illegal acts of vandalism by miscreants.”

“These acts of violence have endangered the lives of thousands of its employees and caused damage and disruption to the vital communications infrastructure, sales and service outlets run by its subsidiaries in the two states,” the statement added. According to the RIL statement, the violence has been instigated and aided by vested interests and business rivals.

Pai has observed that the trend of increasing violence does not bode well for businesses, as the cost of doing business in India is more of an issue than ease of doing business.

“The big issue for businesses is the cost of doing business, which is high because of high supply chain cost, and high legal cost because of a broken justice system. And also lack of choices for businesses and consumers,” he added. The farm bills, he said, were an attempt to expand the choice of businesses and consumers and open up to private trade with the minimum guarantee given to farmers to protect their interests.

In addition, in the case of Reliance, the company is in the trade of retail distribution and its business dealing with grain is extremely small compared to that of the huge market. “Nobody expects either Adani or Reliance to become monopolists and dominate the grain trade in any part of India,” he added.

Total agriculture economy is Rs 32 lakh crore a year in terms of value addition, of which 18 lakh crore is just grains. ""No Indian private company has the money or wherewithal to dominate this trade,"" he pointed out.

“So it is clear, the industry should fight back such vandalism and ask states to enforce the law as it is,” he added.",455,-0.9995858867963155

The Delhi High court is all set to deliver a verdict in the case of Future Retail Ltd.’s petition to restrain Amazon.com from writing letters to regulators against its asset sale deal with Reliance Industries Ltd.

The verdict will be rendered at 10:30 a.m. on December 21, Bloomberg reported.

On November 10, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) approved the acquisition of retail, wholesale, logistics, and warehousing businesses of Future Group by Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) and Reliance Retail and Fashion Lifestyle Ltd.

This came as a huge setback to Amazon which has claimed that Future Group violated its agreement with the US e-commerce giant by entering into the deal with RIL.

2020-11-19 07:25:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/future-deal-amazon-ensnared-in-web-of-contradictions-6134671.html,"Amazon may have become ensnared in a web of its own duplicitousness, finding itself trapped as its attempt to block Reliance’s takeover of the retailer Future’s assets is stymied by legal contradictions.

The US-based online retailer, the largest in the world, has been spinning one set of arguments at an emergency arbitration in Singapore and saying quite the opposite to Indian regulators, a perusal of regulatory filings and legal arguments shows. The consequence is a series of inconsistencies—of Amazonian proportions.

At the emergency arbitration in Singapore, it contended that it has “protective, special and material rights” over the assets of the listed entity Future Retail (which is in the business of multi-brand retail through Big Bazaar, Easyday, eZone and FoodHall) by virtue of its investment in unlisted Future Coupons (which is in the business of wholesale trading of goods and merchandise and marketing and distribution of corporate gifts cards, loyalty cards, and reward cards to corporate customers).

By saying so, Amazon convinced the Singapore emergency arbitrator of its special interest in Future Retail and obtained an emergency injunction to stay Reliance’s acquisition in a slump sale of Future’s retail assets for about Rs 25,000 crore.

Here in India, the US company is telling the Delhi High Court that it only has “protective rights” / “passive rights” over Future Retail. That is because, if it were to make the same claim it made in Singapore, Amazon would be running afoul of Indian laws which do not permit it to own even a single share in Future Retail without government approval.

In August this year, Reliance stepped in to prevent the imminent collapse of Future after the storied retailer found itself dangerously mired in debt, with employees, lenders and suppliers on tenterhooks. Amazon, which dominates online retail in the US and Europe and is the subject of scrutiny for alleged anti-competitive practices there, used the pretext of its shareholding in Future Coupons to block the sale transaction from going through by obtaining a temporary injunction in Singapore with arguments that contradict those it is making in India.

Indian laws allow FDI in multi-brand retail only with stringent conditions, such as using 50 percent of the investment for back-end infrastructure, mandatory local sourcing of goods and services and so on. Most crucially, government permission is needed for such investment.

Thus, what the Seattle-headquartered company did was a two-step duck-and-weave of Indian regulations. First, there was an agreement between listed Future Retail (where FDI would not have been possible) and Future Coupons (where FDI is allowed) that gave the latter effective veto power over the former.

In step two, Amazon invested Rs 1,430 crore for a 49 percent stake in Future Coupons (which owned a 9.82 percent stake in Future Retail), giving itself effective veto power over Future Coupons. Thus, Amazon, with a tiny investment, was able to obtain effective veto powers and control over a multi-brand retail company where FDI is not permitted without government approval.

To try and insulate itself the charge of violating FDI rules, Clause 15.17 was included in the shareholder agreement with Future Coupons. It states that Amazon’s investment is in Future Coupons only and that there is no agreement or understanding in relation to the acquisition of shares voting rights, or exercising control over Future Retail. It also made clear that Future Coupons, the Promoters and Amazon do not intend to act in concert with each other in any way.

What Amazon is attempting now is to claim that it could have invested directly in Future Retail as a Foreign Portfolio Investor. Amazon contends that it could have invested up to 10 percent under the FPI route and that under the current transaction, if the agreements with Future Coupons and Future Retail were conflated, Amazon merely held 4.81 percent in Future Retail through Future Coupons.

Had this investment been done directly in Future Retail, whereby Amazon claims the right to dictate terms on how the promoters must vote as shareholders and how promoter-directors must vote as directors—a position they now claim to be in—government approval would have been required in terms of para 3(a)(iii) of Schedule I of the FEMA FDI Rules.

“Emergency Arbitrator was not familiar with the Indian ecosystem. He fell for the 10% portfolio investment,” Future Retail’s counsel and former Solicitor General of India Harish Salve told the Delhi High Court, where Future Retail is seeking that Amazon stop interfering in the approval process for the asset sale scheme. ""I am subject to Indian Courts. If a gentleman sitting in Singapore says something, I can bin that order. It is not to show any disrespect. I'm saying as a matter of law,” Salve said.

Future Retail has chosen to ignore the emergency arbitration award for a number of reasons. One, Indian laws do not recognise an emergency arbitrator. If any of the parties to a contract wants emergency relief, they have to either approach a high court (in case arbitration proceedings haven’t started) or the arbitration tribunal. Typically, courts hear the matter afresh when such applications are filed.

""Emergency Arbitration is the most important point of law. It is a creature unknown to Indian law and should not be looked at...it may have whatever status in Singapore,"" said senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Reliance, reinforcing Salve’s arguments.

Moreover, Future Retail has not signed any agreement with Amazon. The US retail giant is not a direct shareholder in Future Retail. All Amazon has is a stake in Future Coupons, a stakeholder in Future Retail. So, legal experts ask how Future Retail can be made party to the emergency arbitration.

What Amazon seems to be doing is treating two separate shareholder agreements as composite transactions to claim rights over Future Retail.

The first agreement was signed on August 10, 2019, between Future Retail with the KB Group (comprising Kishore Biyani, his family and some companies they control), and Future Coupons. It gave special rights to Future Coupons. In particular, it said that the retail assets of Future Retail could not be licensed, transferred or sold without the consent of Future Coupons. It effectively gave Future Coupons veto power over the sale of Future Retail’s assets to competitors such as Reliance.

A second agreement was signed 10 days later between Future Coupons and Amazon. Under this, the special rights Future Coupons had over Future Retail were transferred to Amazon. This agreement enjoined Biyani and his firms to vote in the same manner as Amazon in matters concerning the sale of retail assets. It restricted Biyani and his nominated directors from even placing a proposal on these issues before the Future Retail board; further the Future Retail board could not even consider proposals on these issues without Amazon’s consent.

But here’s the nub, according to legal experts. In case, the two shareholder agreements are treated as an integrated transaction that means Amazon has indirect control over Future Retail which is prohibited by law. Indian law allows FDI in multi-brand retail only under stringent conditions and after securing government permission.

Thus, if Amazon gains control, it would not only have violated India’s FDI policy bringing down the Enforcement Directorate upon it, but also required Amazon and Future Retail promoters to make an open offer to the listed retail company’s public shareholders.

That’s the reason why Amazon bought a stake in Future Coupons with a call option to buy shares of Future Retail in the hope that the law would change. That’s why Amazon expressly told the Competition Commission of India that its investment is in Future Coupons and for promoting its interest in that business. And finally, that’s also the reason why the shareholder agreement between Amazon and FCL had the specific clause—15.17.

“Here (Clause) 15.17 in FCPL SHA (Future Coupons Ltd Shareholder Agreement) is important. Amazon is asserting far and above of voting rights,” Salve told the High Court. “The clause says that Promoters and Amazon will not act in concert.”

Although Amazon could possibly invest up to 10% in Future Retail directly through the FPI route, it would have needed government approval to enjoy the special rights over Future Retail similar to the one in the Future Coupons agreement.

In the current instance there is no principle of law which binds Future Retail’s board of directors to Future Coupons’ articles of association. Even if Amazon invested in Future Coupons on the assurance that the latter had special rights over Future Retail, it doesn’t give the US behemoth any derivative rights over the Indian listed retail company.

“There is a fiduciary duty to shareholders when Future Retail is sinking,” argued Salve. “In a listed company, you cannot by agreement dilute this duty.”

It stands to reason that the board of directors acted in the best interests of the company and to avoid bankruptcy. Because the laws are such, Amazon cannot rescue the Future group from bankruptcy. Perforce, Future talked to other suitors and came to an understanding with Reliance.

“This whole concept of minority rights being protected is nonsense. Thousands may lose jobs, Future Retail may go bankrupt but this great American giant should not be upset,” said Salve

The Future Group employs 50,000 people and owes Rs 18,000 crore to financial institutions and Rs 7500 crore to suppliers and vendors. Amazon’s delaying tactics could well push it into a painful bankruptcy.

Note that the Companies Act provides for firms to go in for a scheme of arrangement provided they fulfil certain conditions such as obtaining SEBI approval and getting a nod from three-fourths of shareholders and creditors. This right supersedes any contractual obligations. Moreover, in this particular case, Amazon’s rights, if any, can and only be limited to Future Coupons.

“In today's day and age, to say that I will kill a (Rs) 25,000 crore company… God knows if Amazon still thinks that it's living during the time of the East India Company,” said Salve.

India is perfectly placed to embrace cleaner sources of energy, Chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) Mukesh Ambani said.

Stating that transformation of energy is one of his aims, Ambani said: “India is in the right space to move away from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the next few decades.”

The RIL chairman was speaking at the virtual launch of 15th Finance Commission Chairman NK Singh's Autobiography. Ambani spoke about a range of topics and highlighted his relationship with NK Singh. as well as switching to clean sources of energy.

The event was also attended by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Minister of Social Policies at Singapore Tharman Shanmugaratnam.

Here is a look at the Q&A session with Mukesh Ambani:

Q: When did you first meet NK and tell us about your interactions with him since then?

I call him NK Uncle, because ours is a multi-generational relationship. My father Dhirubhai knew his father and when he entered services my father knew him as a son of his friend. That relationship grew and when I came back from Stanford, I was introduced to him as one of the brightest IAS officers overseeing how this country works. That was my first interaction and I still remember that my first impression was that IAS guys have style!

Since then what really struck me in my consequent interactions was his curiosity. At all times, he would always be more and more curious in terms of saying ‘what’s happening in your generation?’, ‘what more can we do?’

I have seen him in Commerce Ministry, Finance Ministry, PMO, even in the Home Ministry, say, ‘now what can we do in terms of improving our border security or internal security?’ The curiosity and his single-minded mindset in terms of belief in the ability in Indians and India to do and can do and the positivity. From all of us in the industry, he would take those inputs, convert them into action and make sure that … he was a champion, to my mind, of the economic reforms that have actually happened. In the book he calls himself a Ringside View – I think that a more appropriate description of that would be that he was at least one of the modest Ring Masters of this economic transition in the thirty years. And I have been very fortunate to see that closely, to understand his thought process, and to benefit in my own personal development

Q: Dhirubhai once in his office took out a postcard and asked me ‘if every Indian could speak with each other at the cost of this postcard, where will India be? Think about it’. As of June, you’ve nearly 400 million subscribers in Jio, it is the fastest-growing business and the telecom sector. Can you quickly take us through the trials and tribulations, the failures, the successes and the challenges?

As you spoke about my father – he is mentioned in the book. I think that one of the best pictures – the picture that I cherish the most – is part of the book. And, again, just to recap, my father was a son of a schoolteacher who came to the city of Mumbai to live the Indian dream in 1960. And he came with 1000 rupees and a belief that if you invest in businesses of the future and in talent, we can create our own Indian dream, and we can create one of the largest enterprises or companies in the world. As we navigate through the journey of my father in terms of the first few years – and I think the book mentions it – there was a time when Reliance was show-caused by the government and penalised for producing more than its licensed capacity. And then with the economic reforms, today we only incentivize production, and everything that we do today is linked to production and more production. So that is how much mindsets have changed.

If you think about the book and think about what really has happened, we also changed the mindsets of the ruling class, the mindsets of the bureaucracy to be more empowering, to liberalize. And until the DEA licensing in 1990, we used to struggle to create every 10,000; 20,000; 30,000 tons of polyester capacity. At all times, there would be people like N K Singh would have high aspirations for the country saying, ‘Why can't we beat the Taiwanese or ‘Why can't we beat the Koreans’.

And surely, we are now among the top two polyester producers in the world. Even during the COVID crisis we could manufacture PPEs in the shortest possible time. If you look at Telecom, our view was that at the end of the day, we've got to embrace technologies of the future. And this was my father's view, he'd always say ‘I don't want to be only a textile company. If you want to move from textiles, you should move to businesses of the future and you should invest in next generation talent.’ And that is what we've done. Even when we thought through telecom together, the roadmap was very clear. The roadmap was to make calling cheaper than the price of a postcard. Today it is free. And as we migrate to the future, it will not only connect people but also billions of things.

And we have the concept of a digital society, which our Prime Minister unveiled a couple of weeks ago in his AI conference, where he has given a vision for India in terms of using technology for all sectors of our economy.

As we see the journey, the faster we embrace technology, the faster we adopt new technologies and adopt the future industries, we will be better off. And I have to congratulate the finance minister for her leadership and, in the last six months, taking some of the most difficult second-generation reforms. We've talked about second generation reforms, but I think that we have now been bold enough to bring about reforms in Education, Healthcare, Employment, Labour and Agriculture. I am sure that these reforms will lay the foundation for our future growth.

Q: How do you wish to be remembered as?

Well, it’s more than what I wish to be remembered by. It’s not about me, it is about what I can do to contribute to our society and I think, what I am working towards is really three things as we said like the first is really transformation of India into a digital society and that digital society incorporates all the future industries, so that the next 30 years of India is a 100 times, like what we have never imagined is what we can achieve. That’s the first piece that at least in my humble way of working to.

The second coincidently combines with the magic that our respected Finance Minister talked about and I think that linkages in education and its time to transform our education sector at any point in time we have 200 million children in India in the education system and it will take us 8 to 10 years to completely transform the skill base of India and I think that you know what we have been what our Finance Minister very aptly describe what is magic.

I think that we have the formula to convert the magic into reality and establish linkages between academic institutions to real world, skill training and employment in a way that actually sustains India of much higher quality and better jobs.

And the third thing that we are working towards is really transformation of energy. And we think again that the world is right and India is in the right mindset to completely, in the next few decades, move away from fossil fuels to completely renewable energy. Be Atmanirbhar and really try and see if we can make our modest contribution in terms of development of India and in energy also development of the world in terms of this transition. The way I think about it is that what really controls life is, we are already in information. Both with our IT industry has done and what we have done in communications. We are leaders in the world in information. We have to now covert that to intelligence. We have to have the best human resources and we have to have our own energy and be Atmanirbhar.

If I can play my small part in actually achieving this and create institutions that will perpetuate and sustain that than I would have done my Job. I don’t know whether I will succeed or not.

Q: Indian manufacturing has still not become globally competitive and why is manufacturing growth slower than what we would like. What can be done?

We just have to rethink and reinvent manufacturing, I would agree that some areas – like if you take our own refining and petrochemicals, where we are the most globally competitive – the opportunity for us is to embrace the future industries, think in terms of ecosystems. Three specific things we can do for leadership is to strengthen our small and medium sector. Just like we have startups in technology sector, I think India is ripe now to support our small and medium sector entrepreneurs and get them the physical start up. We need as much thinking about bricks as we have about clicks, and we need to think in terms of an entire ecosystem that delivers future industries and future services and I think that we are already on the way, with what we have done with batteries and solar and all the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution.

If we do that right, rather than worry about the past, we can think about the future then the future is not going to be an extension of the past. We can create our new destiny in terms of eco system, platforms and manufacturing which then becomes a high employment generation piece and we then have a play not only for our domestic market, but all the marginal pieces we can support to the international market.

India is now rolling out a massive pan-India optical fiber network, connecting not only all our cities and towns but each of our six lakh villages. This will put India among the top nations in fixed broadband as well.

Third, through your ‘Make in India’ initiatives, we are now creating the capacity for affordable manufacture of all necessary digital devices, sensors, and equipment in our own country.

Fourth, India is becoming a leading nation in compute power with world-class Data Centres. Along with IoT, this is laying the groundwork for smart platforms that will converge physical and digital domains and boost productivity and efficiency to unprecedented levels in all sectors of our economy.

We now have all the crucial components in place to make India a premier Digital Society. Together, our economy and society will generate data at an explosive and exponential rate.

Data is the raw material for Artificial Intelligence. Intelligent data is Digital Capital. It is a vital national resource. In the past, nations have competed on physical capital, financial capital, human capital, and intellectual capital. But, in the coming decades, nations will increasingly compete on Digital Capital. India has the unique advantage to harness its enormous Digital Capital for AI-driven development, which is bottom-up and inclusive. This is because of our twin strengths of Democracy and Demography.

When 1.3 billion Indians are digitally empowered, they will unleash a proliferation of new digital enterprises that will create faster economic growth, greater prosperity, high-quality employment opportunities, and better standards of living, across all sections of our society.

We are confident that the government will introduce a sound data regulation framework to protect this national resource and ensure data privacy. Therefore, the time is ripe, and the tools are ready to make India a world leader in Artificial Intelligence and to make AI work for all Indians.

It is important to understand the epoch-changing importance of AI. The advent of modern Artificial Intelligence is comparable only to the birth of intelligent life on our planet. In the coming decades, the total non-biological intelligence will exceed the rational intelligence of the entire human population.

But this does not mean that AI will replace the human mind. It never can. It never will.

Rather, AI and other associated technologies of the 4th Industrial Revolution will vastly expand our capacity to solve the most complex and pressing problems before India and the world. Specifically, AI will enable India to move faster towards achieving the five ambitious goals set by our Prime Minister.





First, of transforming India into a high growth economy on its path to $5 trillion



Second, of making our Industry and our small businesses Atmanirbhar and dominating new global value chains



Third, of modernising Indian agriculture and multiplying incomes of our farmers



Fourth, of delivering high-quality and affordable healthcare to all Indians



And fifth, of delivering world-class education, skill training, and talent enrichment to every Indian, including those in the remotest parts of rural India

Ladies and Gentlemen, this summit is rightly called the RAISE Summit because it raises our hope and confidence that the hardships and hurdles caused by the corona pandemic will be temporary. India has the resilience and resolves to bounce back and progress faster than ever before.

The very purpose of this summit is to make India future-ready. The Indian industry is ready. The Indian youth are ready. Indeed, the entire nation is ready to implement an agenda that will promote AI for a Strong, Sustainable and Equitable New India. Thank you.

The move ushered in a new communication revolution in the country and is widely recognized as the first time a mobile phone was used in India.

The call made between Writer's Building in Calcutta and Sanchar Bhavan in New Delhi was carried over Modi Telstra MobileNet service. At the time, Modi Telstra was a joint venture between Telstra (Australian Telecom Giant) and India's Modi Group. Modi Telstra was one of eight companies licensed to provide cellular services in India.

Since then, telecommunications have come a long way. Today, India is the world's second-largest market for mobile phones, with the total number of connections crossing the one billion mark. The country has also become the biggest player in the smartphone game, having one of the most competitive markets in the world.

Last year, smartphone sales in India reached a total of 148 million units. The country is considered one of the most important markets for OEMs. There are has also been a massive uptake in the number of smartphone OEMs that have reiterated their comment to provide ""Made in India"" smartphones, which is aimed at helping create new employment opportunities for Indians.

2020 also marks the beginning of a paradigm shift in the smartphone industry, as smartphone OEMs and telecommunication companies veer away from 4G and begin to embrace the next generation technology standard for cellular networks, '5G'. Reliance Jio has already announced plans to kick start the 5G revolution in 2021, with commitments to create a global telecommunications ecosystem with India at the centre.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also praised Jio for prohibiting the use of Huawei equipment in their networks.

""With this decision, the UK joins a growing list of countries from around the world that are standing up for their national security by prohibiting the use of untrusted, high-risk vendors,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.

Asserting that the momentum in favour of secure 5G is building, Pompeo said the UK joins democracies such as the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Sweden in banning Huawei from future 5G networks.

""Clean carriers like Jio in India, Telstra in Australia, SK and KT in South Korea, NTT in Japan and others have also prohibited the use of Huawei equipment in their networks. Countries need to be able to trust that 5G equipment and software will not threaten national security, economic security, privacy, intellectual property or human rights,"" Pompeo said as the British move was welcomed by top American lawmakers.

Democratic Senator Mark R Warner, Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and co-chair of the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, hoped that the Trump administration will begin to engage multilaterally with like-minded allies on promoting secure and competitively-priced alternatives to Huawei equipment.

""My bipartisan legislation, the United Strategic Allied Telecommunications Act, would be a major step in the right direction and I hope to see it included, fully funded, in the eventual defence authorisation act,"" he said.

Senator Jim Risch, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he is relieved to hear that the UK has initiated a plan to remove Huawei products from its communications systems. ""I have long been concerned about the national security risks posed by allowing high-risk vendors such as Huawei, and with them, the Chinese Communist Party, into any of our allies' telecommunications infrastructure. I know this has not been an easy decision to make, but it is the right one,"" he said.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said he is pleased to see the action being taken by the UK to address the security concerns they have identified with allowing equipment from Huawei into 5G networks.

""There is an overwhelming consensus that Huawei is in a position to exploit network vulnerabilities and compromise critical communications infrastructure for the benefit of the Chinese Communist Party. The UK has taken a necessary step to safeguard its national security as it builds out advanced networks,"" he said.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith and Ranking Member Mac Thornberry described it as a reassuring development that will benefit not only British security and privacy, but the ability of these countries to work even more closely together on vital security matters.

""Both our countries have much work ahead to replace Huawei equipment in our networks as soon as possible,"" they said.

Supporting the British decision to prevent the inclusion of new Huawei equipment in the UK 5G network and the goal of removing all Huawei equipment from the network by 2027, Congressman Mike Turner said Huawei's inclusion in the UK 5G network directly puts at risk the ability of the Five Eyes alliance to continue as it has since World War II.

""Today's announcement alleviates the US's critical concern that any information shared with the UK would inadvertently be shared with the Chinese Communist Party through Huawei's inclusion in its 5G network,"" he said.

Reliance Industries on May 23 expanded its JioMart service to customers across metro cities, after successfully conducting a pilot service across Navi Mumbai, Thane and Kalyan, as per a CNBCTV18 report.

The website is powered by Reliance Retail's Smart and Fresh stores. The previous reliancesmart.in currently redirects to the newly launched jiomart.com.

Customers can now login to the jiomart.com website to place an order. The website has various categories such as fruits and vegetables, dairy and bakery, personal care, home care, and baby care.

While the company has not confirmed the list of cities where the service has been launched, punching in PIN codes from various metros such as Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata shows that those areas are service-able.

The minimum amount to avail free delivery is about Rs 750, if the amount is less, Rs 25 delivery charges will be levied.

For payments, it currently only supports payments through netbanking and credit/debit cards while more options will be added later.

During the pilot project across Navi Mumbai, Thane, and Kalyan, Jiomart went live last month with a WhatsApp business account.

Customers could simply add a number to their contact and place their order. However, this service is still limited to selected PIN codes.

Reliance Retail is one of the biggest offline retailer in India with 11,784 outlets. It plans to converge with JioMart offline and online trade not only by driving the online service via inventory from its Smart and Fresh stores but also by spreading hyperlocal ‘Reliance Smart Points’ across the region.

It also plans to register small Kirana stores on its networks, enabling customers to order online and deliver food from their neighborhood.

Last month, Facebook announced that it is investing $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms. Analysts expect Reliance to ride on WhatsApp’s omnipresent reach (owned by Facebook) to integrate the messaging app’s seamless shopping experience, which is about to launch a payment service.

The United States, she said, should start by setting up stronger guardrails to prevent China from exploiting America's economic openness and punish it for its predatory actions.

“It involves pushing back against Beijing's manipulation of international forums like the World Trade Organization. It means ensuring that our most important security-related industries — from essential medicine to semiconductors — have American-friendly supply chains, instead of depending on an authoritarian rival state,” she wrote.

Americans, she wrote, have always understood that national security is the foundation of economic security.

“As we strive to come through the coronavirus crisis stronger and safer, we must courageously and creatively act to protect our people from Chinese communist duplicity and aggression,” she added.

Haley suggested that the US should adopt an approach similar to the Cold War times, when it crafted new policies to check Soviet military technological progress, which included export control and trade promotion.

“Now, it's time to take a similar approach with Communist China. The coronavirus pandemic has shown just how dependent we are on that country for vital medical supplies, from specific drugs to much-needed personal protective equipment. This crisis is as dangerous as the coronavirus itself, and addressing it should be one of our top priorities,” she wrote.

The US Ambassador to the United Nations said the country's reliance on China for medical supplies was clear from the early stages of the pandemic as people rushed to purchase masks, gloves and hospitals tried to stock up on everything they needed, resulting in shortages.

“China, which controls nearly half of all US-imported personal protective equipment, was hoarding material for itself while banning companies from exporting their products,” she alleged.

“All of this leaves us less safe and jeopardises American lives in a time of crisis,” Haley said, alleging it's part of the strategic plan of China's communist rulers.

“Beijing has long had its sights on capturing the world's most important supply chains to give it an edge over America and the free world,” Haley wrote. She said to accomplish this goal, the Chinese Communist Party used its state-led economic model to manipulate the market to its advantage, often illegally. “Among other things, China has subsidised competitors to US companies and ordered the theft of their trade secrets and intellectual property,” she claimed.

She further said in near future, China is especially focused on controlling the cutting-edge industries of 5G, advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence and robotics.

“The Chinese communists envision an authoritarian world where they call the shots and command an unbeatable technological edge. They're working overtime to make that vision a reality. This is where America must respond — and lead,” she said.",515,0.15682879516056605

Queuing up at his local store for grocery worried Naman Jain. With coronavirus cases rising, it was too much of a risk for the resident of the Mumbai suburb of Thane.

A friend then introduced Jain to JioMart, the ecommerce venture of Reliance Industries retail arm. “It’s straightforward. You need to create a login and place an order on JioMart’s WhatsApp number 8850008000 using your phone,” Jain told Moneycontrol.

JioMart sends a link to the customer on WhatsApp that allows the user to pick the items and the order is then shared with the nearest mom-and-pop store. The kirana store alerts the customer when the order is ready. The customer goes to store, pays and picks up the order.

Jain collects his from Dharamsi & Co Kirana, which is 600 meters from his home. No more queues for him.

The disruptor

It was on April 26, four days after Reliance Retail signed a deal with Facebook-owned WhatsApp, that JioMart went live in Thane, Kalyan and Navi Mumbai after five months of a soft launch.

The tie-up was part of the Facebook-Jio Platforms deal that saw the social media giant pick up a 9.9 percent stake in RIL’s digital unit for $5.7 billion.

India’s biggest FDI in technology is also expected to change the face of ecommerce, especially online grocery, an increasingly competitive space. As the coronavirus outbreak changes consumer behaviour, the competition will only get fierce.

“Jio Mart, Jio’s digital new commerce platform, and WhatsApp will empower nearly three crore small Indian kirana shops to digitally transact with every customer in their neighbourhood and small kiranas can grow using digital technology,” RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani said in a video statement on the day the deal was announced.

Jain is a happy customer but what about the store owner, the second important link in JioMart’s grocery push.

“Due to JioMart, we are getting more customers and products are also getting sold. Otherwise, most customers preferred to go to supermarkets,” Dharamsi store owner Manishbhai Dedhia said.

Supermarkets and malls continue to be no-go in most parts of the country as Indians stay home to break the chain of coronavirus infections.

“Margins of kirana stores are in the range of 10-15 percent, of which around 5-6 percent would be shared with JioMart,” Dedhia said.

Owners like Dedhia can keep a tab on their inventory through the Point of Sale (PoS) machines installed by JioMart. These machines also allow them to order their supplies from Reliance’s cash-and-carry stores.

Kirana to the rescue

After the lockdown was announced on March 24, customers struggled to get groceries and other essentials from established e-retailers like Big Basket, D-Mart Ready, Big Bazaar and Amazon.

The sudden spike in orders led to delays and even cancellations as restrictions on the movement of people and goods hobbled these companies.

Kirana shops came to the rescue of harried customers. JioMart connected them to their smaller but efficient neighbourhood grocery stores.

The company took a risk by rolling out during the lockdown but it seems to have worked. It has not only allowed the company to on-board customers but has also given it a chance to test waters before expanding to other cities.

The big picture

“Data is the new oil,” Ambani had said at the launch on Reliance Jio in 2016.

Reliance Jio has maintained it wants to more than a telecom player and is on track to be as an end-to-end digital behemoth.

In its three and half years of existence, Jio Infocomm has emerged as India’s biggest telecom service provider with 388 million subscribers.

Its pricing strategy has played a big role in Jio bagging 32 percent market share in terms of subscriber base, way ahead of rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea.

The telecom business ties in neatly with the company’s digital ambitions.

In the last few weeks, Jio Platforms, of which telecom business is an important part, announced investments worth $8 billion.

After Facebook picked a 9.99 percent stake, American private equity giant Silver Lake Partners bought 1 percent of Jio Platforms for $750 million. Vista Equity Partners also picked up a 2.3 percent stake for $1.5 billion.

The Reliance Retail and WhatsApp arrangement will go a long way in making JioMart “Desh Ki Nayi Dukaan"", as the company describes itself.

India is the biggest market for WhatsApp with 400 million users, while RIL is the biggest retail player in the country.

The partnership will allow consumers to order through Facebook or WhatsApp and these will be fulfilled by Jio’s network of small kiranas and wholesale businesses.

“Our focus will be India’s 60 million micro, small and medium businesses, 120 million farmers, 30 million small merchants and millions of small and medium enterprises in the informal sector,” Jio has said.

India is predominantly a cash economy. The retail sector is largely unorganised and traditionally skewed in favour of offline though online sales have gained in recent years.

The social distancing norms will lead to a noticeable shift towards ecommerce, with customers preferring the safety of homes over going to shops.

Despite digitisation push, cashless transactions remain minuscule. But the outbreak may change that as merchants and customers will look to technology to minimise contact to guard against infections.

For now, customers have to pay in cash for their grocery but experts are of the view that the tie-up with RIL will help Facebook hasten the launch of WhatsApp Pay, which is in a testing stage.



The game-changer?

RIL’s ambitions for Jio are bigger and deeper, says Greyhound Research, a technology and innovation advisory firm.

Biggest investments, in terms of people, technology and maybe even acquisitions in the coming times would be observed in commerce, Greyhound Research Founder & CEO Sanchit Vir Gogia said.

“RIL will put to use its recent acquisitions and offer omnichannel retail across key categories like grocery, pharma, electronics, fashion and lifestyle. With the enabling tech available in-house, RIL can even consider using new-age retail formats like mobile vans,” he said.

The data giant’s collaboration with one of the most common communication platform could boost many businesses, said Zulfiquar Memon, Managing Partner, MZM Legal, who has worked closely with the retail industry.

“The Jio-WhatsApp partnership is a game-changer,” he said. “This JV is not restricted to benefit the kiranas and small retail stores but could change the way the entire B2C (business to consumer) industry operates, including making payments platforms easier and safer.”

Security and consumer data protection would be crucial for an uninterrupted run, he added.

Online food and grocery retail, which accounts for just 0.2 percent of the total market share, is expected grow to 1.2 percent and will be worth $10.5 billion by 2023, driven by an increased assortment of products and efforts like express delivery operations, a report by consulting firm Redseer has said.

The JioMart–WhatsApp collaboration would tap into the solid customer base of kirana stores and tide over inefficiencies associated with such shops, Saxena said.

It will digitise kirana stores as they will receive orders and eventually payments on WhatsApp.

Its widespread network was another opportunity for Reliance Retail to reduce operation cost as grocery space gets competitive, with startups, too joining in.

Its aggressive expansion saw Reliance Retail's revenues go up by 24.8% year-on-year to Rs 1.63 lakh crore for the financial year 2020.

Analysts foresee a consolidation in the grocery space, allowing for only two to three big players.

Walmart-owned Flipkart is mulling a full-fledged wholesale business.

Facing a staff crunch, several online players have tied up with Swiggy and Zomato for doorstep delivery.

They believe JioMart will ensure that the demand-supply gap is plugged.

The Indian consumer is price-sensitive and usually explores the best options before making a purchase. JioMart, with its various offers and WhatsApp as a partner, can target such buyers.

Desh Ki Nayi Dukaan is now open for business.

BIF hailed the move as a “big positive” for the digital sector in the country.

The think-tank believes that the decision to make such a significant investment in the midst of a global pandemic and its resultant economic fallout underlines the resilience, vitality and outlook of the sector for the future.

According to BIF, the partnership between Facebook and Jio could be beneficial to over 50 million micro, small and medium businesses, about 30 million small merchants, millions of small and medium enterprises in the informal sector and 100 million farmers across India.

The pact signed between WhatsApp, Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail to cross-leverage JioMart and WhatsApp is aimed at facilitating new business opportunities and enabling seamless digital connectivity between consumers and local businesses, shops and Kirana stores.

This is especially relevant in the present COVID-19 crisis, which has constrained consumer options, severely impacting the supply chain and standard business practices, forcing smaller businesses to resort to innovative measures to carter to the needs of the consumers.

Mr TV Ramachandran, President, Broadband India Forum, commented on the investment; “Facebook and Jio, both esteemed members of BIF, and leaders in their respective business verticals have come together through this move and reaffirmed the promise and potential that the future holds for the Digital Services sector in the country. The critical importance of this sector has been amply demonstrated by the major role it has played and continues to play in these difficult times to mitigate the ill-effects of the pandemic while maintaining near-normalcy in the country.""

""BIF is happy to note that this investment decision will further boost India’s attractiveness in the global investment community, especially in the digital domain,” it added.

BIF also dismissed the concerns around net neutrality and data sharing rules being flouted. The association said in a statement; “BIF believes that this is erroneous, farfetched and not based on facts. Net Neutrality rules are now unambiguously written into the TSP licenses, and so they are inviolate.”

The think-tank also believes that the move will future strengthen the prospects of the broadband ecosystem in the country.

Facebook's investment for a 9.99 per cent stake in Jio Platforms is the single-largest FDI in the Indian telecoms and technology sector.

Reliance Jio, the wireless market leader with around 390 million subscribers, is a subsidiary of Jio Platforms. At the same time, Reliance Retail, RIL's retail arm, has also partnered with Facebook's WhatsApp to allow RIL's e-commerce business users to use the WhatsApp platform.

Fitch said it had in August last year revised the outlook on RIL's 'BBB' rating to 'positive' and may upgrade to 'BBB+' if ""net adjusted debt/EBITDA ratio improves to below 1.5x on a sustained basis"".

""The deal is part of RIL's plan to strengthen its businesses and to achieve a net cash position - through partnerships and supported by organic growth and lowcapex,"" Fitch said in a statement. ""We expect the partnership with Facebook to bolster RIL's consumer business in the medium term.""

The rating agency said the proceeds from the transaction should help RIL maintain the pace of its deleveraging - counteracting the likely weakness in its refining and petrochemical segment during 2020-21.

Fitch expects RIL's oil-to-chemical segment to face volume and margins headwinds due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in line with the industry trend.

""We expect the pandemic to weaken demand for refined products and petrochemicals in Asia-Pacific during 2020, with a gradual recovery through 2021 to pre-COVID-19 levels. However, RIL should be less affected than peers, due to the high complexity of its refineries and integrated petrochemical operations with feedstock flexibility,"" it said.

The deal, it said, will allow both Facebook and Jio to monetise their digital platforms, engage customers online, and provide direct connectivity between users and merchants.

Usage of digital platforms is likely to grow significantly in the medium-term amid severe disruptions caused by lockdowns and social distancing measures.

Increasing reliance on digital platforms might also assist RIL in gaining market share in India's growing e-commerce segment, and soften the impact of lower footfalls in its physical retail stores.

""Jiomart, which is a market-place platform and built in partnership with small merchants and 'kirana' (small neighbourhood retail store) shops, will allow users to buy goods and services using WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Jio Platforms will focus on introducing digital solutions for 60 million micro, small and medium businesses; 120 million farmers; 30 million merchants; and millions of SMEs in the informal sector,"" Fitch said.

On its part, Facebook is likely to be able to expand its platforms - including Facebook Marketplace, Instagram Shopping and Facebook Pay - to help SMEs set up virtual shops on such platforms and sell goods and services.

Facebook plans to roll out WhatsApp Payments in India and other countries this year, after having tested this with a million people in India in 2018. WhatsApp Platform, which has started charging businesses, is still offered free to retail users globally, it said.

Facebook reported 641 million daily active users (DAU) in APAC in 4Q19, up by 14 per cent year-on-year and now contributing around 39 per cent of overall 1.7 million DAUs.

India is the single-largest market with about 330 million monthly users, and also one of the fastest-growing markets for Facebook. WhatsApp's messaging app also has the largest user base in India, with about 400 million users.

""We believe internet users in the country will rise to at least 800 million by 2022, up from around 600 million in 2019 as India overtook the US to become the world's second-largest smartphone market after China by unit shipments in 2019. DAUs represented around 66 per cent of 2.5 billion monthly active users in December 2019,"" Fitch added.

The deal values Jio at $65.95 billion, way ahead of analysts' estimates of about $40 billion.

Experts say the deal will be beneficial to both sides. ""It’s a win-win situation for both the partners, as on one hand, it gives Facebook a wider audience with Jio’s 388 million clients, it helps Reliance to pay its debt as well as leverage the reach of Whatsapp, Facebook’s chat service,"" Aamar Deo Singh, Head Advisory, Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.

Concurrent with the investment, Jio Platforms, Reliance Retail and Facebook's WhatsApp have also entered a commercial partnership agreement to further accelerate Reliance Retail’s new commerce business on the JioMart platform using WhatsApp and to support small businesses on WhatsApp, RIL said.

This will help Jio leverage India's 900 million-strong internet user base, which is second only to that of China. Analysts say the deal will also help RIL's long-standing dream of being debt-free by the second half of 2021.

The Facebook-RIL deal may also accelerate the listing of Jio on bourses. Since last year, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani has been exploring options to take the company public.

Experts say the multi-billion-dollar deal unlocks Jio's true potential of becoming a leading digital company, which, in turn, would attract more investor and help the IPO initiative pick up pace.

""The deal will help Jio become a true digital company in the coming years. Apart, Reliance will be able to reduce its debt and help the company achieve debt-free status by FY21. In short, we believe this deal with Facebook would augur well for Jio IPO (likely in FY20-21) as it would boost investor’s confidence and attract more investment,"" said Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking.

Following the announcement, shares of RIL rose 11 percent on April 21, while those of Facebook gained 3 percent in after-hours trade.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

In its latest annual report, Aramco said it is looking at investment opportunities in high-growth markets as well as nations that rely on importing crude oil.

India is the world's fastest-growing energy market with fuel consumption rising at 4-5 percent annually.

It also relies on imports to meet its 83 percent of oil needs.

Saudi Arabia is its second-biggest oil supplier, exporting close to a fifth of India's oil sourced from abroad.

""Saudi Aramco is focusing its downstream investments in areas of high growth, including China, India and Southeast Asia, material demand centers such as the United States, and countries that rely on importing crude oil, such as Japan and South Korea,"" the firm said in its annual report.

Besides, the integration of the firm's upstream and downstream segments provides a unique opportunity for Saudi Aramco to secure crude oil demand by selling to refineries designed specifically to economically process Arabian crude oil.

""Furthermore, Saudi Aramco intends to enhance its domestic and global marketing businesses to support the position of its upstream business in key, high-growth geographies, including China, India and Southeast Asia, which are integral to Saudi Aramco's existing business and future expansion strategy,"" it said adding the firm intends to maintain its presence in key large countries that rely on importing crude oil.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani had in August last year announced initial agreements to sell a 20 percent stake in the oil-to-chemical business to the Saudi national oil company.

Also, a 49 percent interest in fuel retailing business was sold to the UK's BP plc for Rs 7,000 crore.

Morgan Stanley in a March 19 research note stated that Aramco had in a conference call stated that it is still conducting due diligence on a potential investment in RIL's oil to chemicals operation.

""Once evaluation is complete, it will move to the next stage of the approval process,"" it said.

Refining and petrochemicals are a cash cow for Reliance.

As part of the August deal, Saudi Aramco will supply 500,000 barrels per day of crude (25 million tonnes per annum) on a long-term basis to Reliance's Jamnagar refinery complex (40 percent of the refining capacity).

Market analyst firm Bernstein in a recent report had stated that Reliance's partnership with Aramco signals expansion rather than retreat as growth opportunities are expected to boost the petrochemical and refining vertical.

Stating that India has significant secular expansion (that is, unaffected by short-term trends) ahead in refined products and petrochemicals, it had said with the lowest demand per capita of 1.3 barrels per person, demand for refined products will grow by 5 million barrels per day over the next two decades, more than any other major market.

Ethylene demand could grow ten-fold from 5kg per person per annum to 50-60kg pp/pa as consumer demand rises.

India is estimated to be the fastest-growing refined fuels market over the next 20 years (faster than China) and will also one of the fastest-growing markets for petrochemicals given the per capita demand which will grow with the GDP.

The single largest asset within Reliance's refining and petrochemical business is the Jamnagar complex, which is one of the world's largest refining hubs.

The Jamnagar complex was built in 2000 with a capacity of 0.67 million barrels per day.

After upgrades in 2008, Jamnagar's crude processing capacity has more than doubled to 1.24 million bpd.

Not only is Jamnagar the largest refinery hub in the world, but it is also one of the most complex refineries globally, allowing RIL to process discounted heavier crude oil into oil products.

As a result, it has decided to start charging its customers 6 paisa per minute on the outgoing calls made to other network to recover the IUC which the company pays to other network providers.

IUC is a cost paid by one mobile telecom operator to another when its customers make outgoing mobile calls to the other operator’s customers.

The trigger

Earlier, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had decided to reduce the IUC from levels of 14 paise per minute to 6 paise, with effect from October 1, 2017, and zero from January 1, 2020. As the chart indicates, IUC, over a period of time, has followed a downward trajectory.

However, TRAI has now started re-thinking whether to bring IUC down to zero or not, which has led to significant uncertainties for RJio which has paid nearly Rs 13,500 crore as net IUC charges to the other operators over the past years.

Therefore, in light of the regulatory uncertainty, RJio has decided to recover IUC cost from its customers. It has, however, assured that this charge will go away as soon as TRAI implements zero IUC. In fact, RJIo is giving additional data with IUC top-up vouchers so that there is no effective tariff increase till December 31, 2019.

Implications

Though there is no direct benefit to Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea from this move -- they would continue to get the same IUC from RJio -- the decision, however, augurs well for the entire industry, which has suffered due to lower Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). This would lead to acceptance of higher tariffs by the customers, thereby giving some pricing power to the service providers to inch up tariffs.

RJio, specifically, would be able to see improvement in its operating margin, post the decision.

Saudi Aramco, the world's largest crude oil producer, is in ""serious discussions"" to acquire up to a 25 percent stake in Reliance Industries' refining and petrochemicals businesses, the Times of India reported on Wednesday.

A minority stake sale could fetch around $10 billion to $15 billion, valuing the Indian company's refining and petrochemicals businesses at around $55 billion to 60 billion, the report said.

The agreement on valuation could be reached around June, the Indian newspaper reported, citing people with knowledge of the development. Goldman Sachs is said to have been mandated to advise on the proposed deal, the report added.

Aramco's interest in the operator of the world's biggest refining complex comes after Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to Delhi in February when he said he expected investment opportunities worth more than $100 billion in India over the next two years.

Separately, Saudi Aramco's Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser had met Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani to discuss the Saudi state-owned company's businesses including crude, chemicals and non-metallics.

Aramco and Reliance were not available for comment outside business hours.

The company said it has ""stopped shipments of diluent naphtha to Venezuela, and has reduced its purchases of Venezuelan crude oil to well below its contracted levels.""

On reports of its refineries in Jamnagar continuing to send fuel to Venezuela in violation of sanctions, Reliance said ""a few transportation fuel shipments to Venezuela, treated as offsets for crude oil receipts, were committed and in-transit when there were no specific restrictions to such transactions. They were all fuels refined in India.""

Reliance will continue its transactions in full compliance of prevailing sanctions, it added.

India's Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world's biggest refining complex, said it had halted supply of diluents to Venezuela's national oil company PDVSA and will not resume such sales until sanctions are lifted.

Washington is preparing to impose ""very significant"" Venezuela-related sanctions against financial institutions in the coming days, US special envoy Elliott Abrams said.

PDVSA was importing about 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of naphtha, mostly from the United States, to dilute up to 400,000 bpd of extra heavy oil and make it exportable.

Reliance's Houston-based subsidiary was supplying diluents to Venezuela.

Reliance, led by Mukesh Ambani, has significant exposure to the financial system of the United States, where it operates some subsidiaries that are linked to its oil and telecom businesses among others.

Reliance has not increased oil purchases from Venezuela, the company said in response to a Reuters email seeking comment.

In 2012 Reliance, Venezuela's key oil client, signed a 15-year deal to buy between 300,000-400,000 bpd of heavy oil from PDVSA.

Ship tracking data obtained by Reuters showed that Reliance averages purchase from Venezuela were below 300,000 bpd in 2018 and in January this year.

""Our US subsidiary has completely stopped all business with Venezuela's state-owned oil company, PDVSA, and its global parent has not increased crude purchases,"" it said.

The administration of US President Donald Trump imposed sweeping sanctions on PDVSA in January, aimed at severely curbing the OPEC member's crude exports to the United States to pressure socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down.

""Since the U.S. government imposed sanctions on the government of Venezuela in late January 2019, Reliance Industries Ltd has been in close contact with representatives from the US State Department to ensure full compliance,"" Reliance said.

The Indian market is crucial for Venezuela's economy because it has historically been the second-largest cash-paying customer for the OPEC country's crude, behind the United States.

""We will continue a constructive dialogue with the U.S. government to ensure Reliance remains in compliance,"" it said.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met India's Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale on Monday and discussed India's purchases of oil from the Maduro-led government.

""We are asking the same thing of India as we are of every country: do not be the economic lifeline for the Maduro regime,"" Pompeo said.

The RFI (Request for Information) or initial tender for the deal was issued by IAF in April 6 2018, the first mega procurement initiative for fighter jets. This was after the government scrapped the process to acquire 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) around six years ago.

""There is no scandal in the Rafale deal. We are going to deliver 36 aircraft. If the Government of India wants more aircraft, we will be pleased to deliver. There is also an RFI for 110 aircraft and we are in the race because we feel Rafale is the best aircraft and we have our footprint here in India. So we feel confident here in India,"" Dassault Aviation CEO Eric Trappier told reporters here.

Asked why Dassault had partnered Reliance despite that company's lack of experience in making defence equipment, Trappier said: ""Yes. But I have the experience. I am transferring this know-how and experience to the Indian team. The Indian team has been appointed by a new company Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DARL).

They are good for India and the company. So where is the problem?"" The deal had raised a political row with Congress relentlessly accusing the Narendra Modi-led government of extending the benefit to industrialist Anil Ambani owned Reliance by firming up an overpriced deal of Rafale jets.

The opposition has been keeping the pot boiling over the deal and made it their electoral campaign for the coming 2019 Lok Sabha elections. India had signed a deal with France in 2016 for 36 Rafale fighter jets.

Asked the reasons for Dassault going ahead with partnering Reliance despite that company's financial problems, Trappier said, ""They have their own matters, but we are working together. Our teams, both Indian and French, are working well.

So I have no worry for the time being."" Trappier also said they chose Reliance as he wanted to be in charge of the industrial process in the company that manufactures parts of the French aircraft in India. ""I invested my money to have facilities here in India and I found partners,"" he added.

On Rahul Gandhi's charge that Rafale prices were escalated during NDA rule compared to UPA rule, Trappier said both nations made a rebate of about nine per cent compared to the original pricing.

The CAG report saying that the Rafale pricing was 2.8 per cent cheaper during NDA rule compared to UPA's showed that the pricing was better, Trappier said. Also, the Supreme Court had said that the deal was totally transparent and hence he was 'very much pleased' with these two observations.

To a query, Trappier said it was sad that politics has taken a front seat in the Rafale deal. Instead, discussions should have been around the importance of having the fighter aircraft for India's defence needs, he said. ""Rafale has high performance capacity. The air force officials have examined the aircraft. This fighter will be one of the backbones of the defence of this country,"" he said.

With the world getting more and more accustomed to the Internet of Things, it is no surprise when more and more apps crop up to control more and more devices. Even home lighting has not been spared from the onslaught.

One of the most useful things to come out of IoT would be connected automobiles. It is true that there are various apps that help monitor your vehicle from service requirements and mileage offered to tyre pressure and now even Reliance Industries seems to be jumping onto the bandwagon.

Reliance has been has been revolutionising the Indian digital space ever since the launch of its Jio 4G network back in 2016. Now the company is preparing a new app called JioMotive to track and monitor your car.

Upon launch, the app will be capable of a variety of features that include using a live map to track your car in real time. This allows you to find your car in a crowded parking lot or even track it remotely while someone is driving.

Other features include the ability to get notifications in case the car is being moved like in the case of towing. Vehicle tampering, theft and accident alerts are also part of the app. Trip insights also come as part of the app with mileage mapping, top speed, emergency brakes, idle time and fuel costs.

To top it off, JioMotive also gets a safety feature which allows you to reach out for medical assistance or in case of a sudden breakdown by sending location and other information to the nearest police station.

Lastly, the app also allows users to upload vehicle documents like registration papers, insurance, PUC certificate with reminders for last date of premiums and re-certifications.

The app is available on the Google Play Store beta stage right now but with 10,000 plus downloads, the early access programme is now full.

Shareholders of Reliance Industries have approved giving Mukesh Ambani another five years as the Chairman and Managing Director of the company. Ambani, 61, has been on the board of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) since 1977 and was elevated as Chairman of the company after the death of his father and group patriarch Dhirubhai Ambani in July 2002.

The company put a resolution to re-appoint Ambani ""for a period of five years, on expiry of his present term of office, i e with effect from April 19, 2019"" at the 41st Annual General Meeting held on July 5 in Mumbai.

As many as 50,818 crore shares out of a total share base of 616.45 crore voted on the resolution, RIL said in a regulatory filing. Of the votes polled, 98.5 per cent were in favour of the resolution while 1.48 voted against it.

According to the resolution, Ambani will be paid an annual salary of Rs 4.17 crore and Rs 59 lakh of perquisites and allowances. Retirement benefits are not included in the overall ceiling of remuneration.

He will also be entitled to receive bonus based on net profits and ""expenses incurred for travelling, boarding and lodging, including for spouse and attendant(s) during business trips and provision of car(s) for use on company's business and communication expenses at residence shall be reimbursed at actuals and not considered as perquisites,"" it said.

Also, ""the expenses, as may be borne by the company for providing security to Shri Mukesh D Ambani and his family members shall not be considered as perquisites and accordingly, not to be included for the purpose of computation of the overall ceiling of remuneration,"" the resolution, which was carried at the AGM, said.

After Dhirubhai Ambani's demise on July 6, 2012, Mukesh was elected Chairman and Managing Director of RIL, while younger brother Anil was elected Vice Chairman and MD.

The two siblings parted ways in 2005 and divided the business their father created between them.

At the AGM, shareholders also allowed RIL to raise up to Rs 20,000 crore through a non-convertible debenture (NCD) issue in 2018-19, according to the regulatory filing.

RIL wants to ""offer or invite subscriptions for secured / unsecured redeemable non-convertible debentures, in one or more series / tranches, of an aggregate nominal value up to Rs 20,000 crore, on private placement, from such persons and on such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors of the company may, from time to time, determine and consider proper and most beneficial"".

The company did not say where the proceeds will be utilised.

""The announcements made by Mukesh Ambani (Reliance Industries Limited Chairman) today have positioned RJio as an extensive technology company rather than just a telecom service provider. This is an interesting development and once the plans laid out today start taking shape, we can expect new streams of revenue to be initiated that will benefit the industry,"" Rajan S Mathews, Director General of COAI, said in a statement.

Jio, the newest entrant in the telecom market, as also old operators like Bharti Airtel and soon-to-be-merged Vodafone and Idea Cellular are all members of the COAI.

Reliance Jio's entry into the mobile segment in 2016 led to a bruising tariff war that dented the financial metrics of the incumbent operators.

After storming the mobile telephony market with free voice calls and dirt cheap data, Ambani today announced an ultra high-speed fixed line fibre broadband for homes and enterprises across 1,100 cities and also outlined blueprint for an online-to-offline 'new commerce' platform.

Mathews said while he expected Jio's proposed fixed line broadband and digital offerings to make ""some disruption"" and drive down prices in the market, the competitive pricing pressure is unlikely to be as intense as seen in the mobile telephony market.

At the 41st annual general meeting of Reliance Industries today, Ambani said customers can start registering for the fixed line broadband from August 15 but did not give a launch date or pricing for the service, which will through home fibre provide high-speed internet, ultra high definition entertainment on large screen TVs, multi-party video conferencing, voice-activated virtual assistance, virtual reality gaming and digital shopping as well as smart home solutions.

Jio has amassed 215 million customers and sold over 25 million Jio phones so far.

""Getting more than 200 million subscribers in such a short time is indeed a commendable achievement, for any company,"" COAI's Mathews said.

Ambani also announced second-generation JioPhone with added features which will be available for Rs 2,999.

""We are happy to note that JioPhone 2 will provide more features/apps, especially Facebook, Whatsapp and Youtube, which will make it more attractive for subscribers. Moreover, the newly launched Jio smartphone is very attractively priced and is expected to see increased uptake; and we expect feature phone users to transition to smartphones,"" Mathews said.

On the new fixed-line broadband offering being lined up by Jio, Mathews said he expected 'JioGigaFiber' to be a ""game changer"" and ""revolutionise"" the Information and Communications Technology sector.

Over the last few years, COAI and Jio have locked horns over a number of issues that ranged from the newcomer's introductory free voice and data offers to provision of points of interconnect and from predatory pricing rules to the voting norms followed by the industry body.

Meanwhile in its latest note, JP Morgan said that while there are no details yet on pricing of the upcoming optic fiber broadband service, it is of the view that given Jio's customer acquisition strategy, the launch pricing should effectively be at a ""large discount"" to current broadband and set top box pricing prevalent.

Here is the full text of the speech:

My Dear Shareowners,

A very warm good morning to each and every one of you.

It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the 41st Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries Limited.

This is the first AGM as Reliance begins its Golden Decade.

The Company's accounts for the year ended March 31, 2018, along with the Directors' and Auditors' report, a Letter to the Shareholders, and Management's Discussion and Analysis, have already been circulated to you.

With your permission, I would like to take them as read.

1. Business and Financial Performance

This year has been yet another transformational year for Reliance.

On one hand, our new-age consumer businesses have started delivering profits. On the other, our hydrocarbon business (refining and petrochemicals) has further scaled up its capabilities to become

more profitable, integrated and predictable in its earnings profile. Together, our hydrocarbon and consumer businesses have helped create more records and scale greater heights than ever before.

I am delighted to report yet another record breaking performance by your company. Our net profits grew by more than 20.6% to Rs 36,075 crore.

Reliance's earnings profile underwent a fundamental change this year. The company's consumer businesses – Jio and Retail – represented about 13% of the consolidated EBIDTA, up from a mere 2% last year.

This increase is especially remarkable because it is taking place at a time when the hydrocarbon businesses are growing rapidly.

I can tell you with confidence that Reliance has reached an inflection point. As the Golden Decade rolls on, our consumer businesses will contribute nearly as much to the overall earnings of the company as our energy and petrochemical businesses.

Reliance continues to be India's largest exporter accounting for 8.9 % of India's total merchandise exports with a value of Rs 176,117 crore with access to markets in 113 countries.

Your company paid Rs 26,312 crore of customs and excise duty – 6.4 % of India's total collections during the year – highest in the Indian private sector.

We also paid Rs. 42,553 crore of GST, which is another record.

Reliance is also the highest Income tax payer in the private sector in India, paying Rs 9,844 crore during the year.

2. Reliance Jio – Our Digital Services Initiative

Dear Friends,

I want to start with Reliance Jio – OUR DIGITAL SERVICES INITIATIVE.

Since I last spoke, we have doubled our customer base to over 215 million now. 215 million customers within 22 months of start is a record that no technology company has been able to achieve anywhere in the world.

In the last one year, we have achieved UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH starting with an already existing large base:

Data usage has grown from 125 crore GBs per month to more than 240 crore GBs per month.

We were the world's largest mobile data network last year and the gap from the others has only widened in the last 12 months.

Voice usage on the network has grown from 250 crore minutes per day to more than 530 crore minutes per day.

The amount of video consumption has grown from 165 crore hours per month to more than 340 crore hours per month.

Doubling of these metrics at such scale is truly unparalleled. Our customers are actively engaged with us for more than 290 minutes per day on an average.

Friends,

Jio's motto is simple:

We are determined to connect everyone and everything, everywhere – always at the highest quality and the most affordable price. Like our customer metrics, our NETWORK also CONTINUES to expand rapidly.

In terms of COVERAGE…

Our network has a wider coverage than any other network in India.

We are on track towards achieving our target of 99% population coverage with 4G-LTE.

This means that Jio will be present in every district, taluk, gram panchayat and village of India.

When it comes to CAPACITY…

Over the past 12 months, we have more than doubled our NETWORK CAPACITY.

Even after serving the needs of our 215+ MILLION customers, the capacity utilization of the Jio network is LESS THAN 20%.

Which means, we can multiply our customer base without additional investment.

We have achieved this unprecedented network growth while maintaining our NUMBER ONE position as the FASTEST network in India… as attested by the TRAI speed-test data for each and every month of the past year.

We recognize that just around 1% of our customers are yet to enjoy the best user experience some of the time.

But we are working tirelessly to satisfy and delight them as well.

Jio is a customer obsessed organization and will work harder to ensure that not even one consumer remains dissatisfied on our network.

Let me now update you about the JIOPHONE. JioPhone has taken the country by storm. I am pleased to announce that we have more than 25 MILLION JIOPHONE USERS in India.

We are now taking the JioPhone to the next level, with added capabilities and functionalities.

Friends,

WHAT COMES NEXT FOR BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY IN INDIA?

While India has pole-vaulted into global leadership in the mobile broadband space… we still lag behind SIGNIFICANTLY in fixed-line broadband.

India is ranked quite low at 134th in the global ranking for fixed broadband,

Poor fixed-line infrastructure has been a key reason for this.

In countries with better developed communication infrastructure, more than 80% of data consumption happens INDOORS THROUGH FIXED-LINE CONNECTIVITY in homes, in offices and other premises. Optical Fiber based fixed-line broadband is the future.

Fixed-line broadband offers HUNDREDS OF MEGABITS, even GIGABITS per second of data speeds. Jio is determined to move India to among the top 5 in fixed-line broadband, too.

Your company has already invested over Rs 250,000 crore for creating state-of-the-art digital infrastructure to provide mobile and broadband connectivity across the country, with the largest fiber footprint.

We will now extend this fiber connectivity to homes, merchants, small and medium enterprises and large enterprises simultaneously across 1,100 cities to offer the most advanced fiber-based broadband connectivity solutions.

FOR THE HOME, this will mean…

ULTRA HIGH DEFINITION entertainment on your large screen TVs…

MULTI-PARTY VIDEO CONFERENCING from the comfort of your living room…VOICE-ACTIVATED VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS who obey your every command…VIRTUAL REALITY GAMING and DIGITAL SHOPPING where you are magically transported into a digital universe of IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCES…

SMART-HOME SOLUTIONS… where hundreds of devices like security cameras, home appliances… even lights and switches… can be securely controlled by their owners using a smartphone… from both inside and outside the home.

This will redefine 24X7 emergency help for all homes.

FOR MERCHANTS and SMALL BUSINESSES, fixed-line broadband means…

When you combine fixed-line connectivity and cloud applications with the agility and customer obsession of a small owner-driven business you empower them to compete on level terms with larger businesses.

Jio is thus performing a task of VITAL NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.

Because the success of Indian small businesses and small merchants translates directly into faster and more sustainable growth with large-scale employment for the Indian economy.

Likewise, FOR LARGE ENTERPRISES, fixed-line broadband will mean…

Having the ability to compete in the global marketplace using digital tools and techniques that are powering the FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION…

We are calling this fiber based-broadband service JIO GIGAFIBER.

Dear Friends,

The three most popular apps YouTube, WhatsApp and Facebook will be available to all the JioPhone users from 15th August.

Jio was born with a purpose. To transform India with the power of the Digital Revolution.

For this vision to be realised, every Indian must become a DIGITAL INDIAN.

However, as many as 500 million Indians still use feature phones, who cannot use the Internet.

The doors of Digital Life are closed to them because of the problem of affordability.

Which is why, last year we offered the JioPhone – India Ka Smartphone – for a fully refundable deposit of Rs 1,500. In other words, for an effective price of zero.

25 million Indians have availed this scheme and become JioPhone users.

This scheme will, of course, continue.

Today we are introducing another attractive offer to feature phone users.

It is the JIOPHONE ""MONSOON HUNGAMA"" offer.

Starting July 21st... they can exchange their existing feature phone for a brand new JIOPHONE for just Rs 501!

We have thus reduced the effective entry cost of the JioPhone from Rs 1500 to as low as Rs 501.

Starting 15th August, our JioPhone2 will be available at an introductory price of only Rs 2999.

Our purpose is to accelerate the Digital Revolution in India with the extreme affordability of a JioPhone, so that each and every Indian can access the internet and enjoy the Digital Life.

Further details about both these offers will soon be made available on jio.com.

With the added functionalities, our wider network reach across India and strong retail presence across India, the goal that I have now set for our Jio team is to enable 100 MILLION users on this JIOPHONE platform in the shortest possible time.

Friends,

JioGigaFiber creates magical experiences that are going to be available to every Indian consumer.

SO… WHEN WILL JIOGIGAFIBER BE AVAILABLE?

We are currently running beta trials in tens of thousands of homes.

Starting this Independence Day, August 15th you can start registering your interest for JioGigaFiber through both MyJio and Jio.com.

We will prioritize our JioGigaFiber rollout to those localities from where we receive the highest number of registrations.

JIOGIGAFIBER will be the largest greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout anywhere in the world, with rollout happening in 1,100 cities of India simultaneously.

So, this 15th of August, Jio welcomes you to celebrate the day of India's Freedom by signing in for every Indian's Digital Freedom. Make sure you register your interest, and more importantly make sure that your neighbors register so that your locality will be among the first to get JIOGIGAFIBER!

At Jio, we are determined to take India to be among the top-5 in broadband connectivity, both for mobility as well as fiber based wireline connectivity.

We have built future proof networks and will continue to deliver the most advanced technologies to our customers for decades to come.

With Jio, we have built a Digital Connectivity Platform of unparalleled capacity and a nation-wide reach. This has enabled Reliance to strategically reinvent itself as a Technology Platform Company.

Digital platforms have become the new-age factories and service providers.

These new hyper-growth engines of value creation are fired by the combination of digital connectivity, computing power and software.

They use data as the raw material, and Artificial Intelligence plays the role that electricity played in the past.

The world is entering into an era of Anytime Value-Creation, Everywhere Value-Creation, and Value-Creation by anyone who has a smart business idea.

I am happy to inform you that your company has prepared itself for this exciting future of non-linear and exponential growth.

3. Reliance Retail

Reliance Retail has been one of the catalysts for the growth of modern organised retail in India.

It is the LARGEST, FASTEST GROWING AND MOST PROFITABLE retail company in India. Our 7,500 stores received over 350 million footfalls last year.

Our revenues crossed Rs 69,000 crore, a growth of over 100% year on year.

More than 4,000 new stores were opened during the year, an unprecedented expansion in the retail industry.

We now operate over 7,500 stores across more than 4,400 cities.

Reliance Digital is the LARGEST RETAILER OF CONSUMER ELECTRONICS in the country.

Reliance Trends continues to be the LARGEST FASHION RETAILER in India…. It sells nearly 1.2 crore garments a month or over 33,000 garments every hour.

In Grocery, we are the LARGEST MODERN TRADE RETAILER. We sold over 500,000 tonnes of groceries last year, connecting thousands of farmers and small manufacturers to happy customers.

Over the years Reliance Market has been creating value for small merchants by bringing both buying and operational efficiency to their businesses.

The existing ecosystem of 3 million plus partners will be enabled further with our digital merchant platform.

Reliance Retail has emerged as the partner of choice for International brands.

It operates the largest portfolio of 41 international retail brands in India.

Our network of over 1,300 fully automated and future ready petroleum outlets on key highways cater to major demand centres and witnessed robust revenue growth.

Based on our growth initiatives and commitment to our customers, I am confident that Reliance Retail will become bigger, better and more profitable.

Friends,

As Reliance transitions to become a TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM COMPANY, we see our biggest growth opportunity in creating a hybrid, online-to-offline NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM.

We shall create this by integrating and synergising the power of Reliance Retail's physical marketplace with the fabulous strengths of Jio's digital infrastructure and services.

This platform will bring together …The 35 crore and growing customer footfalls at Reliance Retail stores...The 21.5 crore and growing JIO connectivity customers. The targeted 5 crore Jio GIGA-HOMES; and…

…Most importantly,

All the 3 crore small merchants and shop-keepers all over India who provide the last-mile physical market connectivity. Hence, we will integrate the physical and digital marketplaces in a uniquely collaborative BHARAT-INDIA JODO enterprise.

We see merchants and small shop owners as critical customer interaction and fulfilment points, who will share a mutually beneficial win-win relationship with us.

Through the deployment of Merchant Point of Sale for small shop owners, we will enable them to do everything that large enterprises and large ecommerce players are able to do.

They will be able to manage inventory, keep digital records and file returns, improve working capital management, retain and upgrade customers, access new customers, run promotion and loyalty programs, link to our highly efficient supply chain, and much more.

Our NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM will redefine retail in India by enabling all customers ─ rich or poor, whether at home or on mobile ─ to transition from simple shopping to personalised Immersive shopping experience.

This will be made possible by Augmented Reality, holographic technology and VR devices.

Our digital tools will predict and anticipate the needs of shoppers.

JioGigaFiber will bring the entire marketplace to large screens powered by high speed broadband at home.

We will also leverage Reliance Retail's deep insights into Indian customers, large local presence, and best-in-class supply chain.

We will invest in the best data analytics engines using artificial intelligence to bring a powerful offering to all consumers, merchants and small businesses.

We will also facilitate availability of financing to small shopkeepers and merchants to improve their capital efficiency, so that they can become competitive and grow their businesses.

Thus, the principal purpose of our hybrid NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM is to promote Shared Prosperity.

This will enable even the smallest merchant to earn more, employ more people, and give common Indian customers the best value for their money.

4. Media and Entertainment

Let me turn to our media and entertainment platform.

We have already created a large portfolio of media and digital properties, which are as widespread as they are valuable.

We have the largest portfolio of TV Channels in India - 69 Channels across News and Entertainment.

We have India's largest TV News Platform in News18 that is multilingual providing independent and reliable news.

We also have India's largest entertainment platform which spans all major regional languages.

We are consistently ranked amongst the top players in each of our segments.

We are the partner of choice for leading global brands like CNBC, CNN, Forbes, History, MTV and Nickelodeon.

Our digital properties MyJio, JioTV, JioCinema, JioMusic, BookMyShow, FirstPost and MoneyControl are all leaders in their category with significant embedded value.

We have a leading market share in television broadcasting, movie production and distribution, digital content and commerce, print magazines, mobile content and allied media services businesses,

One in every two Indians consume Network18's content.

One in every five internet users in India is on Network18 websites or apps.

Regional content and digital delivery continue to be the focus of Network18, which will drive its future growth.

The media and entertainment platform with a viewership in excess of 700 million enables us to achieve a very special societal purpose:

Our purpose is two-fold: to provide wholesome entertainment and to enrich the power of Ideas that can make India a great nation.

5. Other Platform Opportunities

Let me illustrate the power of our PLATFORM BUSINESS STRATEGY by highlighting three other large opportunities.

Agriculture

First, and most important, the AGRICULTURE PLATFORM.

In agriculture, India has an unprecedented opportunity to create wealth and new knowledge-rich livelihood opportunities in rural areas.

…by encouraging adoption of technologies for water conservation, soil management, precision farming, waste reduction.

…to enhance agricultural productivity.

Our purpose is to benefit both the kisan and the consumer.

…to more than double the incomes of our farmers.

…and to bring nutritious food products to consumers at affordable prices.

I am sure that if we combine digital technology tools with the innate knowledge and wisdom of Indian farmers, Jio can usher in a SMART NEW GREEN REVOLUTION in India.

Education

Second, the EDUCATION PLATFORM.

The purpose of this platform is to overcome the challenge of poor and inadequate educational infrastructure by digitally delivering high-quality education and skills training to schools, colleges and universities across the country.

This will enable every educated Indian youth to earn a respectable livelihood and contribute to the nation's wealth.

We have to equip our children to be digitally-savvy right from school.

So that we can lay the foundation for a sustained leadership in the digital age for India.

Through Jio, we are providing broadband connectivity to all the 58,000 colleges and will connect 1.9 million schools across the country.

These educational institutions collectively provide education to nearly 200 million children.

And all these can be done in less than two years. Jio will achieve this by partnering with a large number of stakeholders. Once this is done, India will have one of the most-digitally enabled education systems in the world.

Healthcare

Third, the HEALTHCARE PLATFORM.

Here our purpose is to ensure affordable and quality healthcare to all, which is both a national necessity and a national responsibility.

For the first time in history, this has become possible because of digital technologies – accessible across the country and even in remote locations.

India can considerably overcome the deficit of physical infrastructure of hospitals and doctors by universalising telemedicine, tele-radiology, eDiagnostics, genomics and other cost-effective cloud-based solutions.

This cannot happen overnight.

It is a long-term gestation opportunity, and we will pursue this with a host of partners to realise this for India to become a global leader in healthcare.

To summarise, our DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY PLATFORM has served as the foundation on which we are building our NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM, OUR MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM, EDUCATION PLATFORM, HEALTHCARE PLATFORM and AGRICULTURE PLATFORM.

Going forward, we shall build more such platforms. Each of these will create significant shareholder value and enormous societal value.

6. Hydrocarbons Business

Let me now turn to the performance of our hydrocarbons business of petrochemicals and refining. This year Jamnagar completes 20 years of operations.

Jamnagar has expanded manifold in scale, complexity, scope and size since we commissioned the world's largest greenfield refinery in 1998.

Let me update you on the progress of the projects, as we are now nearing the end of our largest-ever investment at Jamnagar.

We have successfully commissioned and stabilized the world's largest Paraxylene complex.

Today, Reliance is the second largest PX producer in the world and Jamnagar has the distinction of being the largest manufacturing facility of PX in the world with 4.2 million MT of capacity.

We also commissioned the largest off-Gas cracker complex in the world. Using our Refinery off-gasses as feedstock, this cracker is the most cost competitive ethylene cracker, globally. This positions us uniquely, as one of the most efficient producers of Polymers in the world. I am proud to report that both these projects have been completed in a record time frame, at world-beating capital productivity and commissioned flawlessly. Both the Paraxylene and Cracker complexes are already running substantially higher than their design capacity.

The Butyl rubber project will be commissioned later this year.We are also adding a new line of materials to our portfolio – composites and carbon fibre.

These high-value materials will cater to the growing needs of India's transportation and alternate energy sectors.

All these projects position your company amongst the leading and most-diversified and integrated producer of materials globally.

In Petrochemicals, we continued to generate value for our customers through constant innovation and product development.

As an example, we launched R-Elan, a super micro-denier polyester with unique anti-sweat and anti-bacterial properties for use in active wear.

Similarly, our RecoSilk and SuperFeel products have emerged as products of choice in ladies fashion wear.

Environmental regulation is now a global imperative.

I am happy to state that your company is the largest recycler of PET in India recycling over 2 billion bottles annually.

We are committed to becoming a leader in the emerging circular economy and to become one of the largest recyclers of plastics in India, All these initiatives will enhance our capabilities and competencies, making us future-ready, as we transition from a cyclical business to annuity business.

Let me now turn to Refining business.

This year we commissioned the world's largest and most unique Petcoke gasification project. I am pleased to share that the DTA Gasification complex startup and stabilization was accomplished in a record time of

less than 120 days against a typical 9 to 12 months period required for a project of this magnitude and complexity by global peers.

The gasification project will eliminate the dependence of the refinery on imported natural gas and add value to our profitability, particularly in a high oil price scenario.

Our strategy of a full “Bottom of the Barrel conversion” is truly unique.

A key element of our configuration driven competitiveness is the integration of Refining with Petrochemicals.

As a result of our robust and flexible configuration we are also uniquely positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities in view of IMO 2020.

The forthcoming changes in sulphur specifications of bunker fuel will lead to a significant jump in demand for low sulphur distillates.

Equally it will benefit versatile and complex refiners like us with a capability to process challenged heavy crudes.

We began our “Oil to Chemicals” journey starting with the inception of the Jamnagar complex in 1996-1999 when Reliance challenged the industry paradigm and set a new benchmark by maximizing Propylene and Aromatics.

We took a further quantum jump with the commissioning of the world's largest Refinery off gas cracker and the Paraxylene complex.

These set of new projects have redefined Oil to Chemicals integration.

It is our belief that with the rapidly increasing demand for Petrochemicals maximizing Oil to Chemicals conversion will play a catalytic role in determining profitability of hydrocarbons businesses of the future.

As the world migrates from fossil fuels to renewable energy, we will further maximize this Oil to Chemicals conversion and upgrade all of our fuels to high value petrochemicals. This up-gradation will be implemented in a phased manner over the next decade to meet the rapidly increasing demand for petrochemicals, in India and the region. The hydrocarbon business is thus poised for robust value creation and exciting times ahead.

7. Oil and Gas Exploration and Production

Your company, along with its joint venture partner BP, continues to optimize its India upstream business by pursuing integrated development in KG D6 Block. In these gas field developments, we will deploy many advanced technologies to start gas production in 2020 and reaching full production of 30-35 MMSCMD by 2022.

Our Gas marketing JV with BP is looking for opportunities to source and distribute gas to Indian consumers including in cities.

Our Coal-Bed Methane production crossed 1 MMSCMD level last year.

We have started the second phase of CBM development to more than double the current production.

Your company is proposing a cross-border merger of RHUSA with RIL thereby integrating the US gas resources with Indian market as we have done with ethane for Petro-chemicals.

I am confident that our participation in the gas economy of India will generate value in the coming years.

8. Reliance Foundation

I would now like to share the good work being done by our Foundation.

Let us congratulate Nita for her leadership of the Foundation and her relentless efforts in driving grassroots sports and education in the country.

Our diverse sports initiatives provide a world class platform to young sportspersons.

In recognition of her accomplishments in the field of sports, Nita was awarded the Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Puraskar by the Honourable President of India.

Reliance Foundation's rural transformation initiatives are focused on establishing strong market linkages for farmers and leveraging technology for better reach and impact.

The initiatives now reach out to over 13,500 villages in 15 states across the country.

We are now focused on increasing our reach and expanding the scope of our Foundation to deliver impact to larger sections of India through a combination of partnership and direct action.

I hope to share several success stories with all of you in the future as Reliance Foundation continues to make a difference as the largest corporate Foundation in India.

9. Value Creation Roadmap

Last year I had shared with you my vision for value creation in Reliance's Golden Decade. We are laying a robust foundation to realise this vision.

We have already made a lot of progress in the past year.

Reliance is making a strategic transition to become a Technology Platform Company. We are focussed on creating multiple platforms that will accelerate our growth and create significant societal value for

years to come.

Our connectivity platform has already made Jio the largest mobile data network in the world. Through JioGigaFibre we will now build the home-and-office connectivity platform.

A platform that potentially connects 50 million homes. It will be as big as the mobile connectivity platform. Moreover, it will have a much higher value proposition because the core investments have been made while building the mobility network.

The third big platform that we are building is New Commerce.

This platform has the potential to redefine retailing in India and become one of the biggest new growth engines for Reliance in the years to come.

We are also looking at nation-wide platforms in Agriculture, Education and Healthcare.

I am confident that our growth in these consumer businesses, based on asset-light platforms of the future, will be nonlinear and exponential.

In our hydrocarbon businesses, the largest ever cycle of investment in our world-scale complex projects is nearly complete.

This will yield healthy profits for many years to come. The value-chain integration allows us to create an annuity-like cash flow with lower risk of cyclical markets.

Reliance was among the first companies globally that adopted an 'Oil to Chemicals' strategy and manage it as one integrated business.

We have a full plan to further increase the level of integration by adding new chemical chains and capacity to produce new materials and composites of high value.

This will minimise the impact of renewables and electricity on transportation fuels.

We have the unique advantage, among global players, of being able to pursue this strategy with physical integration at one large site.

I am confident that our current business model and planned investments make our hydrocarbon portfolio future-proof with sustained earnings growth.

We are committed to strengthening our balance sheet while we pursue growth and realise multiple monetisations.

As the earnings from our consumer businesses begin to match those from our hydrocarbon businesses, I assure you that the next decade will truly become a Golden Decade for Reliance.

10. Conclusion

Reliance has always been a responsible Corporate Citizen.

We know fully that our responsibilities have grown with our opportunities.

We shall discharge them with utmost commitment. Employment generation for all our youth has become an urgent national imperative.

In addition to employing as many as 200,000 people in the last two years alone, Jio and Retail have created indirect livelihood opportunities for 1 million people across India.

In all our digital service businesses, data privacy is sacrosanct.

Cyber-security is our solemn promise.

Our energy and petrochemical businesses follow the philosophy of not only the Green Economy but also the Circular Economy.

Because we care for the Environment, which is the most precious asset of mankind. Lastly, ensuring the safety, satisfaction and happiness of our employees is our Dharma, because, for me, all of them are members of the extended Reliance Family.

Before I conclude, permit me once again to share with you ─ and with all my dear countrymen ─ a dream I have inherited from my father.

It is the dream to see India become an economic superpower.

And to see that India becomes a global leader in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

India's prosperity and Reliance's progress have been closely intertwined in every phase of our journey so far. Which is why, Reliance has become a shining icon of Modern India.

As India starts on its high growth journey to double the size of its economy by 2025, I assure you that the size of Reliance will more than double in the same period.

And the creation of societal value by Reliance will be of an even higher order. Old-timers amongst you will recall that whenever our Founder Dhirubhai Ambani spoke of India, there was a surge of patriotic passion in the audience.

He always urged us to 'Think big, think fast, think ahead…and, above all, THINK OF WHAT WE CAN DO TO BRIGHTEN INDIA'S FUTURE.'

That passion will never subside.

As we kick off our Golden Decade with a flourish, we remind ourselves of Reliance's unwavering commitment towards India's Rise.

May the God Almighty bless us in our endeavour.

11. Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the Central and State Governments, shareholders, investors, suppliers and customers for their consistent and resolute support.

I thank all my colleagues on the Board for their unanimous support and immense encouragement.

I have special words to acknowledge the collective efforts of the entire Reliance team, working tirelessly for creating and sustaining a world-class enterprise.

Thank you.",5043,0.8948196134121298

Krishna Karwa, Nitin Agrawal & Ruchi AgrawalMoneycontrol Research

A recent Goldman Sachs report has hinted at the possibility of Reliance Retail going public in the foreseeable future. This calls for a closer look at the Mukesh Ambani-led retail giant, especially at a time when D-Street is getting increasingly bullish about this fast growing sector.

About Reliance RetailReliance Retail (RR), a part of Reliance Industries, is India’s biggest retailer by revenue and network. The company has 7,573 retail stores (with a retail area of 17.7 million square feet) and 495 company owned company operated (COCO) petro retail outlets across more than 4,400 cities throughout the country.

What could work in Reliance Retail’s favour ?Supply chain tie-ups: Given the breadth of its presence, RR has been successful in sourcing products cheaply and has ensured last-mile connectivity through distribution partners across geographies.

Brands: Keeping product differentiation and appeal in mind, RR has a basket of private label brands in its kitty:

Since its own brands have better margins, the company can afford to increase marketing and promotional spends for the same to drive revenue growth.

Diverse product range: RR’s key product verticals include fuel retailing (Reliance petrol pumps), food items, apparel, lifestyle accessories, electronic goods, jewellery and footwear. Varied price points within each category, coupled with periodic schemes/discounts, have helped mitigate segmental risks and boosted revenue growth over the years.

Aggressive expansion: To accelerate sales growth, RR is focusing on a healthy blend of outlet additions and same-store sales growth. Grocery and fashion outlets attract high footfalls, but consumer electronics have a higher ticket size per transaction. To capitalise on the boom in e-commerce, the company is investing more in its online portals too.

Peer comparison – an overview

The path ahead RR has all that it takes to hold its own when pitted against the best in the Indian retail industry. Topline traction visibility across all segments, increased emphasis on omnichannels and own brands and the ability to leverage RIL’s strengths (in terms of logistics, sourcing efficiencies, Jio’s vast customer base etc) should boost its growth prospects noticeably.

In the grocery segment, RR is optimistic about the fruits category. In case of apparel, a robust domestic demand scenario is further bolstered by the company’s association with 36 foreign brands. The company’s downstream fuel outlets are strategically located on highways and derive good volumes. Lastly, tailwinds in the white goods industry will benefit the consumer durables segment.

However, RR, like any other retail company, isn’t immune to some bottlenecks. Retail businesses, more often than not, are not high margin. Compounding the problem for RR is the fact that juicy margins in some segments could be offset by lower margins in others. Stiff competition will persist, thus necessitating capex and operating expenditure at regular intervals.

Does a shareholder receive any value on RR's listing ?We valued the various businesses of RIL based on FY20 projected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by sum-of-the-parts (SoTP) methodology to calculate the potential upside if the retail business was to be carved out.

Should RR be listed as a separate entity by going through a public issue, we expect it to trade at an FY20e enterprise value/EBITDA of 24.8 times. We arrived at this multiple after considering a discount of 30 percent to the average industry EV/EBITDA multiple of 35.4 times. The discount is because RR’s operating margin is only 3.7 percent as against the industry average of 7.9 percent.

The markets are factoring in value from RIL's retail division in RR’s price. RR’s EBITDA constitutes only 5 percent of RIL's consolidated EBITDA. Hence, RR’s margins won’t move the needle for RIL's overall margins significantly.

If RR was to be hived off from RIL and listed, the upside would be limited.

Debt-ridden Reliance Communications said the number of employees have come down by over 48,000 to the current level of 3,400 people.

This is a reduction of a whopping 94 percent from the peak level of around 52,000 employees.

""Total number of people in the RCom group: from peak of approximately 52,000 to current 3,400, a reduction of approximately 94 percent,"" RCom said in a BSE filing.

The company was estimated to be at its peak around 2008-10.

RCom, which is reeling under debt of around Rs 45,000 crore, closed it mobile services business in January this year and continues to provide business-to-business (B2B) telecom services.

The company in the filing said that its B2B unit is insulated from ongoing tariff war in the industry.

""The tariff wars between the incumbents -- Airtel, Idea, Vodafone and the new entrant Reliance Jio continue unabated, further dragging down all key financial metrics of the wireless sector. However, post its wireless B2C business exit on January 2018, RCom is no longer affected by the severe and prolonged wireless sector hyper competition,"" the filing said.

RCom said it is evident from the latest sector revenue report released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India that the wireless sector continues to be on a downward spiral, with over 21 per cent revenue decline on an year-on-year basis.

Overall revenue market size shrunk by over Rs 26,000 crore on annualised basis, it added.

Reliance Communications is close to resolving its lingering debt problems with its asset sale plan taking definitive shape, thus averting any need for write-offs of any loan or conversion of debt into equity by banks, according to the company’s Chairman and Managing Director Anil Ambani.

With the company set to exit the strategic debt restructuring process it was negotiating with its 35 lenders, the company’s debt will come down to Rs. 6,000 crores from Rs. 45,000 crores currently, Ambani said.

The 40-day exercise that the company undertook will help it escape from the clutches of the National Company Law Tribunal that its foreign lenders had approached to recover their debt.

​Ambani said the company had received 75 expressions of interest for sale of its various assets and definitive documents were at an advanced stage of negotiation with the entire process being overseen by a committee headed by Reserve Bank of India deputy governor SS Mundra.

“All the final binding bids have already been received by the lenders and we expect a full and financial closure of all the transactions for all the modules that we are running to be completed between January and March 2018 which is the next three months,” Ambani said at a press conference in Mumbai. He said the entire monetization process was to be solely used to prepay the debt of the lenders.

Those words from the junior Ambani sent shares of his company soaring to the day’s high of Rs. 23 before closing the session at Rs. 21.33 on the BSE, still up as much as 30.78 per cent from Friday’s close. Markets were closed Monday on account of Christmas.

He said the company’s asset monetization programme comprised five modules related to its wireless business and 125 acres at its Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City campus in Navi Mumbai. The five modules of the mobile business included the company’s spectrum portfolio, its 40,000 towers, optic fiber network, mobile switching nodes spread over 5 million square feet of space and real estate that is not part of the Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City campus.

Ambani said the company had also run a process, run by real estate consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle, to select a contractor to develop and monetize 20 million square feet at the knowledge city. According to him, bids from five developers had been received for the purpose. He said HDFC Realty had pegged the gross proceeds from the development of the land at Rs. 25,000 crores. He said a special purpose vehicle holding this real estate will have long-term debt financing of Rs. 10,000 crores on a non-recourse basis.

Speaking on the shape the company would take once the debt resolution is put behind, Ambani said the new Reliance Communications would be a B2B company with 90 percent of its revenues being annuity in nature and half the revenues coming from overseas.

Ambani said the company had also received non-binding interest from nine companies to acquire strategic stake in it, pegging its enterprise value, post all the restructuring and debt pre payments, at Rs. 15,000 crores.

The stripping down of Reliance Communications’ business is an outcome of the onslaught of competition brought in by the second coming of Mukesh Ambani in telecom when his company and Reliance Industries subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm launched its services.

The entry of Jio has led to a spate of mergers and acquisitions in the sector which has seen Bharti Airtel acquiring Telenor and Tata Teleservices’ business, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular merging and Reliance Communications shutting most of its wireless business. The Anil Ambani company spared the international voice traffic business, consumer broadband and 4G post-paid dongle services from the axe. These businesses have been moved to the company’s enterprise segment.

Continuing its streak, Tata has topped the table for the best Indian brands for the fifth year, according to the Interbrand Best Indian Brands 2017 report. Tata is followed by Reliance which has toppled Airtel to third place riding on the successful launch of Jio.

Commenting on its stellar run, Harish Bhat, the Brand Custodian of Tata Sons, said, “Over the past 149 years of its existence, the Tata Group has consistently kept the community at the centre of everything it does, in line with the vision of its founder, Jamsedji Tata.”

“Simultaneously, Tata has remained relevant to every generation, powered by its pioneering spirit. These values make Tata a unique and powerful brand that is well regarded and much loved by all its stakeholders.”

In the top 10 Indian brands, four are strictly financial services providers. HDFC is at 4th position, followed by Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and State Bank of India (SBI) at 5th and 6th position, respectively. The largest private sector lender, ICICI Bank is at 9th position in the list.

Other brands which complete the top 10 are IT major Infosys at 7th, Mahindra at 8th and Godrej at 10th. Maruti, Reliance, HDFC, JSW and Kotak showed the best growth performances, according to the report.

“Maruti Suzuki, our top growing brand for the second year in a row has done an exemplary job with Reliance, Kotak, JSW, HDFC and Ashok Leyland not far behind,” said Ashish Mishra, Managing Director, Interbrand India.

There are two brands which appeared on the list for the first time. The motorcycle maker Royal Enfield which has established its own cult following in the market is placed at 17th position. The brand is valued at Rs 90.8 billion riding on its successful year on year financial performance.

Cement manufacturer Ambuja Cements with a brand value of Rs 15.18 billion also made its entry into the list at 40th position. The company which saw its merger with ACC negotiated the impact of demonetisation successfully and gave strong financial results.

The top 40 Indian brands have a combined total value of Rs 4755.7 billion, an increase of 5 percent from 2016.

Andhra Pradesh government has tied up with Reliance Retail and Future Group to convert fair price shops under the Public Distribution System into 'Village Malls'.

Incidentally, Future Retail last year purchased the retail business of Heritage Foods in which Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu's family has a stake.

Both Reliance and Future will now be partners in the 'Village Malls'.

In all, there are 29,000 fair price shops across the state of which 6,500 would be converted in the first phase and christened 'Anna' Village Malls after former Chief Minister N T Rama Rao.

The Chief Minister, at a high-level review meeting here today, directed the Civil Supplies Department to make the Anna Village Malls attractive and also design a special logo.

The state government, he said, would bear 25 percent of the establishment cost while another 25 percent would be provided as a loan to the dealers under the Centre's Mudra Yojana.

Products manufactured by women self-help groups and Girijan Cooperative Corporation would also be sold at the proposed malls along with the agriculture produce procured directly from farmers.

""The Anna Village Malls will enable anyone to sell their products,"" the Chief Minister added.

Interestingly, it was revealed during the review that as many 4,599 FPS dealerships were lying vacant in the state for the past several months.

The Chief Minister directed the authorities to fill these vacancies soon.

RIL had in May become the first buyer of gas it produced from its own coal-bed methane (CBM) block after agreeing to pay the highest price for the fuel.

It paid USD 4.23 per million British thermal unit for the CBM produced during May-June.

""For 2Q (July-September) FY18 supplies discovered price is USD 4.50 per mmBtu,"" the company said in an investor presentation after announcing first quarter earnings. ""RIL is the successful bidder.""

RIL said it began CBM production from its Sohagpur blocks in Madhya Pradesh in March this year.

""205 wells are flowing and production ramp up is in progress. Produced 8.6 million standard cubic meters of gas in 1Q FY18,"" it said.

Following the April decision of the government to give coal bed methane (CBM) producers freedom to discover market price, RIL invited bids from users of gas.

The price discovered in the process was USD 4.23 for May-June and USD 4.5 for July-September.

The rate is almost double the USD 2.48 per mmBtu price RIL gets for natural gas produced from its eastern offshore KG-D6 block.

RIL said average production of gas from KG-D6 was 6.4 million standard cubic meters per per day and oil and condensate at 2,791 barrels per day during April-June quarter.

This compares to 7.4 mmscmd of average gas production and 3,749 bdp of oil and condensate production during January- March.

""Production continues to decline due to natural decline in the fields,"" it said. ""Currently eight wells in D1-D3 and three wells in MA field (in KG-D6 block) are under production."" RIL has invested about USD 500 million in CBM and laying a 300-km pipeline from Sohagpur to Phulpur in Uttar Pradesh to connect to the national gas grid.

Through the April 13 notification, the oil ministry had stated that a CBM producer has to call for open bids for sale of coal gas and seek price quotes to discover the market price.

The process prescribed was the same as the one RIL had run in 2012 to discover a price for CBM gas it is to produce in Madhya Pradesh. Back in 2012, it had sought bids for 3.5 mmscmd (as against 0.40 mmscmd put on offer this time) of coal gas from its Sohagpur CBM block in Madhya Pradesh at a benchmarked rate at 12.67 per cent of JCC, or Japan Customs- Cleared Crude, plus USD 0.26 per million British thermal unit.

The formula was the same at which Petronet LNG, a joint venture of public sector oil companies, whose chairman is the oil secretary, used to buy long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.

At USD 100 per barrel oil price prevalent that year, CBM from RIL's Madhya Pradesh block was to cost USD 12.93 per mmBtu. At USD 55 a barrel rate currently, it would cost USD 7.2. That formula was, however, rejected by the ministry even though 59 valid bids seeking about 70 mmscmd of gas were received in the open tender.

This time, RIL sought bids in form of a deductible from Platts DES West India price of USD 7.659 per MMBtu.

Shares of Balaji Telefilms soared over 8 percent intraday on Friday as investors cheered a stake purchase by Reliance Industries on Thursday.

In a late evening announcement, Balaji Telefilms announced that Reliance Industries invested Rs 413.28 crore to purchase 24.9 percent stake in the company.

The investment will take place through a preferential issue of 2.52 crore shares at Rs 164 apiece, aggregating to the said amount, Balaji Telefilms told the exchanges in a notification.

The proceeds from the transaction would be used to further speed up content development initiatives, especially for ALT (its digital content platform), thereby providing it with a strong ability to compete with other OTT service providers- both global and Indian.

“We welcome Reliance Industries as a partner in our growth journey towards becoming the preferred content producer for the Indian diaspora across all means of video consumption and across all geographies. This investment is a vote of confidence to the Company’s strategic move to own our IP and our viewers,” Jeetendra Kapoor, Chairman, Balaji Telefilms, said in a statement.

Axis Capital acted as the sole investment banker for the transaction.

The company was also in the news recently after one of its top executives exited the firm. It announced the stepping down of its Group CEO Sameer Nair from an executive capacity.

""Nair was formerly in an advisory role with the company and now, on the successful completion of his 3-year term, he relinquishes his executive role with effect from July 15 and returns to an advisory capacity,"" the media company told the exchanges.

They are sewing up a thread of unorthodox revenue streams including data monetisation, cross-selling of financial products, forming credit access platforms and creating alternate merchant payment models to get around the constraint of not being able to lend.

These pre-dominantly digital companies can accept deposits of up to Rs 100,000 per customer, but cannot give loans. This rule makes them ineligible to earn money from interest rates, the primary income source for conventional banks.

Airtel Payments Bank, Paytm and India Posts Payments Bank have already launched operations. Finotech, Vodafone and Reliance are expected to launch their payments banks soon.

“A lot is happening from the technology, regulatory and legislation perspective,” said Rishi Gupta, managing director and chief executive officer, Fino Payments Bank.

Of every Rs 100 of deposits collected, payment banks will have to invest at least Rs 75 (75 percent) in approved government securities, and may choose to park the remaining Rs 25 (25 percent) in current and fixed deposits of conventional commercial banks.

Government bonds and bank fixed deposits are currently fetching annual returns of about 7 percent, limiting the payments banks’ ability to widen their margins and offer attractive interest earnings to customers to save money with them.

According to experts, payments banks are likely to offer micro-savings options, given that most of their customers will have a propensity to make small, infrequent savings. This could mean customers could be allowed to maintain FD accounts with amounts of as low as Rs 100.

“While savings is core to banking, very few banks have taken an approach toward encouraging micro-savings, i.e. making acceptable savings amount to near zero,” said a recent report entitled 'Alternate revenue models for Payments Banks in India' by EY, an audit and consulting firm.

“Payments Banks need to focus on developing products that significantly reduce the minimum denomination that needs to be accumulated to be put into a savings product,” the EY report said.

These companies are also likely to offer a suite of products by cross-selling services such as insurance and mutual funds through strategic alliances with non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), asset management companies (AMCs) and even conventional large banks.

“Payments bank cannot lend on their own, but can offer credit products on behalf of partner banks,” said Gupta. “We are following a two-pronged approach, (earning through) transaction fees on the banking activity that the customer does and (through) cross-selling charges”.

Cross-selling charges are fees that a bank can earn, as commission, by partnering with other financial institutions and providing services such as insurance and loans.

Vivek Bekgavi, partner-fintech leader, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), an audit and consulting firm, said that said that tie-ups with other banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), mutual funds and insurance companies could be the “main source of income” for payments banks.

Payments banks can also develop alternate merchant payment models with low transaction costs for merchants and customers.

“The idea with payments bank is that they can make money from the merchants’ side,” Bekgavi said.

While some banks have decided to charge a fee from customers on cash withdrawals from bank branch, others will charge Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cash withdrawals above a certain limit.

“Payments Banks can make customer transactions, including merchant acceptance, free as long as they are within the bank’s ecosystem. This will incentivise merchants to accept cashless payments, reduce the acquiring costs and positively impact the overall system. However, to prevent cash-outs, free withdrawals can be limited,” the EY report said.

Data monetisation can turn out to be another major revenue source for these banks in the years to come.

After it reaches a critical mass, analysing data along with additional customer profile parameters can lead to valuable insights about spend patterns and preferences. These insights can enable payments banks to explore new revenue opportunities, EY said in its report.

These banks will generate a high volume of consumer transactions-led data, which will include transactions such as mobile recharges, utility bill payments, e-commerce spends and offline merchant transactions.

A significant value can be unlocked if this data is analysed and consumer insights are be monetised, which can help in very precise targeted marketing without compromising on data privacy.

“Payments bank need to have a very strong system of data analytics,” Bekgavi said.

While many experts believe that payments banks will take about five years, on an average, to break even, Gupta was confident that Fino Payments Bank will turn profits after the third year.

“We expect to break even in three years’ time,” said Gupta.",770,0.4659978449344635

Reliance Industries

Citi maintained its buy call on the stock with an increase in its bull case target to Rs 1,923 due to higher Jio valuation and lower peak net debt. It believes that the company’s outperformance could sustain as the earnings are an at an inflection point. Among key risks to the stock are weakening in refining fundamentals and global petrochemical spreads, the research firm added.

Analysts at the firm termed the company’s March quarter performance as strong, with the standalone EBITDA being 3 percent ahead of estimates. Meanwhile, the profit after tax (PAT) was largely in line, it said. Gross refining margins of USD 11.5 per barrel

were above its estimates, it said.

On the company’s capex plans, it sees standalone capex being lesser than USD 2.5 billion in FY18. Jio’s capex in the first quarter of the fiscal will be similar to March quarter before declining sharply, it said.

Nomura maintained its buy call on the stock as well, but with an unchanged target price of Rs 1,540. The brokerage house observed that the net profit was 1-2 percent ahead of its estimates, driven by lower tax rate. It too feels that the recent outperformance of the company could sustain.

However, the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and profit before tax (PBT) were below its estimates on the back of higher depreciation and lower other income. These numbers too were partly offset by lower finance costs, it added.

Going forward, it sees earnings growing ahead once Jio, petchem and refining expansion projects start to deliver. It expects consolidated EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 19 percent/15 percent, respectively over FY16-20.

Meanwhile, it observed that high capex on Jio continued during the quarter and expects similar capex in Q1 of this fiscal. The near term focus will be on addition in customers of Jio. Having said that, it feels that the large capex cycle is coming to an end.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch has downgraded the stock to neutral, but increased the target price to Rs 1,450 from Rs 1,375. The global brokerage firm observed that the firm’s March quarter net profit was 9 percent above estimates, while refining beat was led by GRM.

Analysts at the firm now have the focus on Jio’s success and the capex cycle. They believe that a further rerating on the stock is contingent on a successful Jio P&L as well as falling capex. It further added that while capex could decline, there is limited visibility on a successful Jio P&L.

The stock could find support from growth in Jio’s monthly subscribers, while weak margin, project startup hiccups and high capex were the key risks, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, has an overweight rating on the stock as it saw upside risks from improving energy margins as well as project executions. A steady project pipeline commissioning from FY18 should reduce the risk of further capex, it added.

JPMorgan is neutral on Reliance with an increased target price of Rs 1,310 from Rs 1,240. While the lower capex in its core business was positive, Jio was the key unknown element, it said. Further extension of discounts by Jio would be negative, it added.

Rolling forward its valuation to FY19, Deutsche Bank raised its target by 10 percent to Rs 1,600. Lower downstream margins, policy vagaries were the key downside risks for stock, it said.

Indiabulls Housing Finance

CLSA retained its buy call on Indiabulls Housing Finance with an increase in target price to Rs 1,170 from Rs 950. The brokerage firm also raised its earnings estimates by 3 percent and saw 23 percent profit CAGR over FY17-20. It observed that the earnings growth was led by topline growth and operating efficiencies. CLSA also saw growth to be led by housing loans, especially from the affordable segment in the next three years.

Mahindra and Mahindra

Credit Suisse upgraded Mahindra and Mahindra to outperform from neutral and increased the target price to Rs 1,500 from Rs 1,390, implying 20 percent potential upside. While tractor volumes were up 14 percent in March despite demonetisation, there was a potential for tractor business to surprise positively, it added.

The weakness in utility vehicle market was already factored in, it observed. The stock was currently trading at a 40 percent discount to Maruti Suzuki, which it expects to narrow.

UltraTech Cement

CLSA raised the target price of the stock to Rs 4,575 from Rs 4,000. The company’s March quarter performance was in line with its estimates, it stated. A pan-India presence, growth focus and cost optimization were the key focusses, CLSA said. UltraTech was the only preferred stock in the sector, it added.

Deutsche Bank reiterated its buy call on the stock with an increase in target price to Rs 4,750 from Rs 4,560. It highlighted the company’s gain in market share during a challenging environment in the cement space. Moreover, it expects continuing reduction in costs and working capital for the company.

Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating with a target of Rs 4,690. It projected 25 percent EBITDA CAGR over FY17-19 and added that the focus on cost by the firm will aid earnings growth.

JPMorgan, meanwhile, has an overweight rating on the stock with a target of Rs 4,400. Citi, on the other hand, has a buy call on the stock with a target of Rs 4,400.",913,0.32536999384562176

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)

CLSA has retained its conviction buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 3,000. The research firm believes that while the company missed revenue marginally due to a drag in BFSI and retail, other verticals such as telecom, manufacturing and life sciences surprised positively. It sees growth accelerating from the first or the second quarter of this fiscal.

Analysts at the firm observed that the constant currency margin was intact due to ramp ups in Dilligenta projects and may aid margin in FY18. As such, it sees shaved margins by 60 basis points in FY18 but still expects expansion in FY18-19. It has cut earnings by 2 percent. Furthermore, the capital allocation policy announced by TCS lacks detail, it added.

Macquarie has maintained a neutral stance on the stock with a lower target of Rs 2,274. It has lowered FY18-19 estimated earnings per share by 3-5 percent. A pick up in US BFSI, large deal win are the key likely catalysts for the stock.

Deutsche Bank reiterated top buy status on the stock with a target at Rs 2,900. It expects the firm to deliver constant currency revenue guidance of 9.4 percent year on year in FY18. Furthermore, it has also cut earnings estimates by 4-5 percent given the margin miss in Q4. It expect the company to deliver EPS Of Rs 145.7 in FY18 & earnings CAGR of 12% in FY18-20

JPMorgan has a neutral call on the stock with a target of Rs 2,450. The research firm observed that FY17’s robustly free cash flow/PAT conversion ratio implies 75-80 percent PAT paid out as dividends.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch has retained an underperform rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,130. It believes that TCS’ Q4 revenue growth and EBIT margin were below consensus and expectations. It expects a decline in EBIT margin as rupee appreciation is also weighing on it.

Citi has a sell call on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,140 from Rs 2,195. The company’s Q4 results are largely in line with estimates and the margin band of 26-28 percent looks difficult considering FY17 miss. The lower than consensus expectation remains unchanged, it added. Furthermore, valuation at over 17 times FY18e is difficult to justify given the slowing growth.

IDFC securities has reiterated its neutral rating on the stock with a cut in target price to Rs 2,325. The soft performance in Q4 is largely on account of weaker BFSI and retail growth. It believes that the drag from larger vertical would restrict revenue growth to 6 percent. Appreciation in rupee and investment to mitigate visa risk will erode earnings further, it added.

The brokerage house was factoring in mid-single digit earnings CAGR over FY17-19

The management’s outlook for BFSI is stronger for FY18, but optimism is not translated in deal wins, it added. Furthermore, it is factoring in slight erosion in operating margin, but sees downside risk if the rupee held on to its level.

Jefferies has maintained its buy call on the stock with a reduced target to Rs 2,590. It projected dollar revenue growth of 8.7/10 percent in FY18/19 with margin below 26-28 percent range. A more constructive outlook for FY18 and robust execution are key positives.

ICICI Securities retained add call on the stock due to the management commentary on strong pipeline and deal momentum. The target price for the stock is at Rs 2,415. It expects growth at higher end of peer averages on an organic basis in FY18. But it also sees difficulty in sustaining margin in FY18 even at lower end of targeted range.

Goldman Sachs has maintained its neutral rating with a cut in target price to Rs 2,092. The earnings in Q4 were below expectations and BFSI growth remained elusive, the research firm observed. A pick up in BFSI and strong digital practice should lead to 8.3 percent CC growth in FY18.

Coal India

Citi has a buy call on the stock with a cut in target price to Rs 325 from Rs 375. It sees a fair bit of negative news flow to be priced in.

VST Industries

ICICI Securities has downgraded the stock to add from buy, but increased target to Rs 3,249 from Rs 2,713. The brokerage remains positive but the 40 percent rally in the past four months is compelling it to downgrade the stock.

Reliance Industries

JPMorgan has a neutral call on the stock with a target of Rs 1,240. The brokerage house expects another strong quarter, driven by a strong refining margin. It expects standalone PAT at RS 8,180 crore and EBITDA should be up 6 percent quarter on quarter. Furthermore, on Jio, it maintained the view that it would turn profit positive only in 2021.

Reliance Industries (RIL) reclaimed its tag of India's most valued company in intraday trade on Tuesday, surpassing that of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) at Rs 4.5 lakh crore.

Bringing an end to 8 years of underperformance, RIL rallied 30 percent so far in the year 2017 and has been hitting a multi-year high on a regular basis, compared to a little over 2 percent fall in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in the same period.

There are many positive developments going in favour of RIL. The stock has been an analysts’ radar from the beginning of Jio launch back in the month of September 2016.

Apart from being under-owned, the major trigger which analysts are not forecasting and which is still not reflected in the valuations is the cash flows from RIL Jio from 2018-19 as well as refining margins which are likely to outperform its peers.

Goldman Sachs maintains a buy rating on Reliance Industries posts Q3 results with a 12-month target price of Rs 1210. The global investment bank expects RIL's refining margins to outperform peers due to high complexity.

Goldman Sachs expects full benefits of new refining/petchem projects in FY19. It also sees new projects driving FY16-19 earnings CAGR of 11 percent.

“RIL has broken out of multi-year consolidation in the last quarter out of an 8-year-old triangular formation on long term charts. Usually such a break out after prolonged consolidation shall lead to bigger rallies. In case of RIL, logical targets in the present robust bull market shall be to make new life time highs with a re test of 2008 high present around Rs 1,649 levels whereas pattern breakout target is placed around Rs 1,873 levels. Even after this kind of bigger rally which the counter witnessed recently it still qualifies as buy because of clearly visible upside potentiality,” said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in.

India’s oil & gas major witnessed long buildup on Tuesday with the rise in open interest (OI) which suggests traders are creating long positions, but delivery percentage remains low at 36 percent.

Reliance Industries

CLSA has retained its buy rating on the stock. The research firm believes the new promotional offer will further cement high data usage. Jio could reach 100 million paid subscribers well before March 2019 estimates, CLSA observed. This may lead to an upgreade in EPS estimates. Strong delivery by Jio could drive a significant stock re-rating, it added.

Morgan Stanley believes Reliance Jio’s offerings are attractive and disruptive as Jio Summer Surprise. The new offerings are at 40 percent discount to Bharti Airtel’s average revenue per user (ARPU).

Cairn-Vedanta

Macquarie has an outperform rating on Vedanta with a 30 percent upside potential to its target price. It believes that the Cairn-Vedanta merger further diversifies Vedanta’s earnings and strengthens balance sheet. Post the merger, the company will be the 20th largest free gloat midcap company in India.

On the financial front, Vedanta’s Q4FY17 production shows good volume ramp-up across divisions, analysts at the firm wrote in their report. Strong production with higher commodity prices will help the firm repeat historic EBITDA in Q4.

Furthermore, it sees a lot of steam being left in Vedanta’s valuations. It valued the stock at five times EV/EBITDA.

Eicher Motors

Citi has maintained its buy call on the stock with an increased target price of Rs 30,000 from Rs 28,000 earlier. It believes that Q4 results are likely to be strong driven by volume growth of over 20 percent year on year. The margins would be over levels of 32 percent on higher operating leverage.

The expected a further increase in the waitlist period for Royal Enfield, which is already on the higher side. It is not ruling out a shift of potential Royal Enfield clients to Dominar due to the long waiting. The firm hit a peak production capacity of 60,000 units a month. With the third plant at Vallam Vadagal likely to start production by Q3 of this fiscal, the combined capacity will be 75,000 units per month and nine lakh a year.

It has increased FY17-19 Royal Enfield volume estimates by 1-2 percent and has also increased consolidated EPS estimates by 4-5 percent over FY17-19. Citi has also increased target multiple for Royal Enfield business to 34 times from 33 times.

Petronet LNG

Nomura has a buy rating with an increased target of Rs 510 from Rs 425. It believes that earnings can grow 17-19 percent despite a very strong base. It also sees no risks tp the company’s eligibility to raise tariff by 5 percent in the near term. It feels that the company can still surprise on volume and marketing margins as LNG demand remains strong.

Yes Bank

CLSA has a buy call on the stock with an increased target of Rs 1,920 from Rs 1,780. Recent USD 750 million capital raise will lift Tier-I car to 15% and aid faster growth, the research firm said. Furthermore, it expected the retail segment to lead loan growth.

Meanwhile, the CASA should continue to expand at over 35 percent over the next two years. The research firm also raised profit estimates for FY18-19 by 6-7 percent.

Cyient

Credit Suisse has initiated coverage on the stock with an outperform rating and target of Rs 625. It believes that the firm’s offerings are relatively immune from challenges that the IT industry is facing. H-1B/L-1 visa dependence is less than 15%, possibly least among its Indian peers, the research firm said. It also expects Cyient to report over 13 percent revenue CAGR over FY17-19. Meanwhile, the margins have scope to expand from the current 13.6% to 14.6% by FY19.

Power

CLSA has a buy call on Tata Power and a sell call on Adani Power and Adani Enterprises. The research firm sees no impact on Tata Power’s estimates after the Supreme Court’s ruling on compensatory tariffs. The company may cut cost by shifting to cheaper coal against Melawan currently. Tata Power Mundra UMPP claimed under- recovery of 70 paise/kwh during Q3, it said in its report.

Meanwhile, on Adani Power, CLSA feels the recovery of USD 578 million to Adani Power by Adani Enterprises looks tough after the apex court’s order. Furthermore, Adani Power is falling short to service 12 percent of debt even at 90% operating PLF.

Non-banking financials

Credit Suisse is positive on Shriram Transport Finance, LIC Housing and Cholamandalam Finance. Additionally, it expects Bajaj Finance and Indiabulls to continue to deliver fast growth. Bharat Financial Inclusion should see some growth after the decline seen in Q3 and it will look for improvement in its collection efficiency. It expects steady growth and continued margin expansion for LIC Housing.

For vehicle financers, it sees a resumption in growth after being hit in December. Q4 will see two Shriram firms’ transition to 120 days past due (DPD) from 150 DPD. These lower DPD may result in an increase of gross NPA numbers.",833,0.8453481472455538

Telecom operator Vodafone today complained to Trai that Reliance Jio is still ""luring customers"" to subscribe the 'Summer Surprise' offer despite the regulator finding it in violation of norms.

""Reliance Jio is continuing with this offer held as not meeting regulatory norms, in the garb of configuration changes. For past three days, it has been promoting and luring customers to quickly recharge to avail the benefits of a non-compliant offer and also asking its retailers to communicate the same,"" Vodafone said in a letter to Trai.

The letter also referred to SMSes allegedly being sent by Reliance Jio to consumers and retailers asking them to quickly recharge to avail the benefit of the scheme.

An SMS content reads that Jio has given time till April 10 to its customers for enrolling for the scheme.

The Mukesh Ambani-led Jio on March 31 had announced that the customers who were yet to register for its ""Prime Membership Plan"" will have time till April 15 to join the scheme by paying Rs 99 and recharging with a minimum of Rs 303, which will get them 3-month complimentary 4G service.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) asked Jio on April 6 to stop the offer as it was not in compliance with the norms.

""In our view, such promotion of the customers on an offer held as non-compliant, is a blatant violation and disregard of Trai's advisory. Such promotions to customers makes the regulatory advisory meaningless,"" the letter said.

Vodafone said that Reliance Jio's continuation of the scheme paints a wrong picture to customers of non-robust regulatory framework where non-complaint offers are allowed to be sold in the market.

""Considering above, we request for Trai's immediate intervention and issuance of suitable directions to Reliance Jio for withdrawing the said offer on immediate basis and notifying the consumers about withdrawal of said offer from the date of advisory received from Trai,"" the letter said.

When contacted, Reliance Jio spokesperson said the telco in its press release on April 6 made it clear that the 'Summer Surprise' offer will be withdrawn as soon as it is operationally feasible, in compliance with the regulator's advice.

""All the customers who have subscribed to the 'Summer Surprise' prior to its discontinuation will remain eligible for the offer. We are pained to note such continued and deliberate attempts by competitors to create unnecessary confusion in the market,"" the spokesperson said.

Vodafone, however, declined to comment on the letter it sent to the regulator.

Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal also met today Trai chairman R S Sharma and believed to have discussed a range of issues, including the Jio offer, according to sources.

Shares of index heavyweight Reliance Industries rose over 2.5 percent intraday, driven by buying interest among investors due to the positive response to Jio Prime membership offer.

The shares were off to a flier on the first day of FY18 as well and drove up the indices higher.

Buying momentum spilled over on Wednesday and that saw the stock touching Rs 1,400 mark. With this upmove, the company’s market capitalisation clocked Rs 4.5 lakh crore.

Investors have been placing a bullish bet on the stock after the company announced an extension of its Jio Prime membership deadline till April 15.

Over 72 million Jio customers have signed up for Jio Prime membership, the company said in a statement.

""Customers who could not enroll for Jio Prime by March 31 can still do so by paying Rs 99 along with their first purchase of Jio’s Rs 303 and other plans till 15th April,"" Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani had said in a statement.

The entry of Jio in the Indian telecom space has rained offers on consumers but it has also had a huge impact on digital consumption.

The disruption caused by the new entrant initiated a price war, which led to prices for data plans – including for 4G -- falling in a big way. This led to a shift in the way people consumed data.

According to a report by KPMG-FICCI, 4G connections in India are expected to grow five-fold from 2016 to 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38 percent. About 80 percent of mobile broadband connections are expected to be either 3G or 4G, which the former expected to surpass 2G by 2019.

Less to pay, more to watch

Before the 4G revolution got underway in India, watching video online seemed to be a not-so-affordable option but as data rates came down due to competition, video streaming gained the most from it.

According to the report, video streaming apps saw a 336 percent increase in their usage after Jio launch.

The battle between telcos is not just about prices: they are also competing with each other over which offers the fastest speeds. In a recent commercial, Bharti Airtel claimed to be the fastest internet provider, offering global broadband tester Ookla’s speed certificate as “proof”.

Cheap access to high speed data is also increasing the quantum of data each user consumes: the report sees a 5.5 times rise in data consumption per mobile user by 2021.

Video consumption shifting from TV?

Digital video viewing is growing 50 percent year-on-year and video as a segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 40 percent by 2021.

Over the top (OTT) players, such as Amazon Prime, Voot and Jio apps, have introduced viewers to an alternate way to consume video.

These players are leveraging cheaper data rates offered by telcos to make viewers shift from traditional television to smartphones.",381,0.4260210565158299

United Spirits

Jefferies has reiterated an underperform rating on the stock with a lowered target price of Rs 1,812 from Rs 1,900. The research firm sees a disruption due to the Supreme Court order that banned liquor shops on highways. Even if states choose to circumvent the ban, the company may still see demand destruction, it added. The ban will now shift demand to shops further away from highways.

The key risk to the stock could be monetization of non-core assets and a further buyback by Diageo.

On the financials front, analysts at the firm have cut FY19 earnings per share estimates by 6.5 percent and value the stock using 12-month forward PE target multiple of 50 times.

CLSA has recommended a sell call with a reduced target price to Rs 1,600 from Rs 2,100 as profitability could be long going ahead. It has cut FY17-19 EPS by 17-28 percent, but also expects states to support the industry during the transition which will still take time. The key upside risk to the stock could be the hope of a tender offer from Diageo.

Morgan Stanley is overweight on United Spirits with a target price of Rs 2,900. It foresees 42 percent of the country’s liquor sales facing dislocation due to the ban. Furthermore, it sees a near-term impact on the firm’s volumes as the business gets aligned to the new rules.

IIFL has an add rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,250. The brokerage house sees muted growth to FY18 on the back of the apex court’s verdict as well as implementation of GST. The ban will weigh on the company’s Q4 alcohol sales as well.

Further, demonetisation impact will continue to be visible, but at a lower level than Q3. It sees the firm’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation growing 15 percent and hence sees 14 percent decline in EPS in Q4.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects the SC verdict’s impact to be material but transitionary in nature till shops relocate. It sees the decision hitting liquor firms as 35-40 percent liquor outlets are located along the highways. This relocation will drive de-stocking in the near term which can impact Q1 volume.

Reliance Industries

JPMorgan is neutral on the stock with a target of Rs 1,240. The research firm sees Reliance’s decision to extend Jio Prime deadline as a step to add more subscribers and believes that the firm’s telecom journey has just begun. The sign-ups are a positive, but extension and more freebies are puzzling, it says.

Furthermore, it sees net debt to continue to rise and the final capex figure is yet to be seen. Jio would need revenues of USD 400-500 billion to be PBT positive and forecasts EBITDA of USD 221 billion in FY21 and USD 287 billion in FY22. The stock also implies a telecom EBITDA of over USD 4.7 billion.

Chairman, Reliance Industries

Dear Jio Family member,

Last month, I announced a special membership program – JIO PRIME - for all Jio customers who signed up before 31st March.

JIO PRIME offers many attractive benefits – the absolute best data tariffs in the industry, free voice calling, access to all Jio apps, and many more periodic surprises going forward. JIO PRIME members will always get the very best of what Jio has to offer.

In just one month, over 72 MILLION (and still counting!) Jio customers have signed up for JIO PRIME. We, at Jio, are honoured and grateful for this tremendous response.

I want to personally thank you for choosing Jio, and for being a founding member of the Jio movement. A movement to transform India. A movement to empower and enrich each one of you with the revolutionary power and possibilities of Digital Life.

I assure you that Jio will always be obsessed with serving you and delighting you every day.

Over the past few days, we have been deluged by millions of customers queuing up to purchase Jio’s popular Rs 303 and other tariff plans. This nationwide trend indicates that very many customers are still in the process of purchasing JIO PRIME and their first paid tariff plan.

I am committed to WALKING THE EXTRA MILE for my Jio Family members.

We have heard your voice, and we are EXTENDING the deadline for purchasing Jio’s Rs 303 (and other) plans till 15TH APRIL. This extension will provide the necessary breathing room for users to avoid service disruption during the transition from free to paid services.

Customers who could not enrol for JIO PRIME by 31st March for whatever reason can still do so by paying Rs 99 along with their first purchase of Jio’s Rs 303 and other plans till 15th April.

Jio’s free service period is COMING TO AN END. Users who do not recharge by the extended date of 15th April will experience degradation and/or discontinuation of services.

But, I am conscious that this is the largest migration from free to paid services in history. We are committed to doing this gradually, so that both Jio and Jio customers have the time to adjust, fine tune and perfect this transition.

I want to assure you that Jio will walk alongside you all through this transition to paid services.

Dear friend,

In India, we have the fine tradition of SHAGUN – offering gifts on auspicious occasions.

For us, your first recharge is an auspicious moment. Therefore, we want to offer a token of our appreciation and gratitude to all JIO PRIME members… the JIO SUMMER SURPRISE.

Every JIO PRIME member – when they make their first paid recharge prior to 15th April using Jio’s Rs 303 plan (or any higher value plan) – will get services for the INITIAL 3 MONTHS on a complimentary basis. Your paid tariff plan will be applied only in July, after the expiry of the complimentary service.

This complimentary period will also help to familiarize Jio customers with Jio’s fully digital, self-service process of using the MyJio app to perform recharges and to set up digital payment methods for further purchases.

The JIO SUMMER SURPRISE is the first of many surprises for our JIO PRIME members. Details of JIO SUMMER SURPRISE will be available on the Jio website (http://www.jio.com).

I invite all Jio customers to take full advantage of the extended timeline, as well as the JIO SUMMER SURPRISE, and complete the purchase of Rs 303 (or higher) plan well before 15th April.

All JIO PRIME customers who have already done their first recharge of Rs 303 (or higher) before 31st March will get the benefit of JIO SUMMER SURPRISE without any further action on their part.

Dear family member,

Jio has created the world’s largest greenfield 4G LTE wireless broadband network, with over 100,000 mobile towers. And we will add another 100,000 towers to our network in the coming months. This greenfield investment – of over Rs 200,000 crores – is the largest anywhere in the world.

We are acutely aware that we have small pockets of congestion on our network. With our investment in network expansion, you will see a dramatic improvement in service quality in the coming weeks.

Mobile Number Portability (MNP), which allows consumers to retain their existing mobile number when they switch to Jio, is available for all consumers. Lakhs of consumers have already used this facility. If you have not done so already, I invite you to do MNP and make Jio your permanent home.

For International travellers, Jio’s International roaming service is now available across the world, with the best voice and data rates in the industry.

Dear Jio Family member,

I commit that Jio will always strive to provide you the highest quality – and the world’s most affordable – data and voice services.

I thank you once again for choosing Jio and look forward to you enjoying Jio’s next-generation services to the fullest.

For me, Jio is a mission to enable each one of you to live and experience Digital Life in all its destiny-reshaping possibilities.

Jio provides opportunities for every Indian to prosper and live a better life.

Isn’t it time for us, together, to strengthen the Jio Movement for creating a New India?

Yes, it is!

May you and your family members continue to live a beautiful Digital Life.

God bless you, and God bless our beloved nation.

With warm regards,

Mukesh D. Ambani

The Nifty took a breather after hitting a record high of 9,218 in the previous week and closed 0.56 percent lower for the week ended March 24, 2017.

Investors who went long in this market should continue with their positions as long as index holds 9,048 levels, suggest experts.

Here’s are top cues from domestic as well as international markets which could have a bearing on D-Street.

Govt may table GST on Monday

The government is likely to table supplementary goods and services tax legislations in Parliament on Monday. Sources said C-GST, I-GST, UT-GST and the compensation law are likely to be introduced in the Lok Sabha and could be taken up for discussion as early as March 28.

According to the sources, the government is looking at the passage of the GST Bills in the Lower House by March 29 or latest by March 30.

Wall Street ends flat

The US stocks ended flat on Friday as the Trump administration struggled in Congress to repeal Obamacare. For traders, it heightened concerns about Trump’s ability to push through major tax reforms as well as infra spending that had spurred equity valuations to fresh records.

Benchmark US stock market indices ended the session. The S&P 500 index ended fractionally lower, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped about 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose about 0.2 percent.

SGX Nifty

The Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 6 points higher at 9,118 indicating a flat-to-positive opening for the domestic market.

Reliance to appeal against SEBI verdict

Reliance Industries on Friday said it would appeal against SEBI's decision to ban the company and 12 others from equity derivatives trading for a year and disgorge nearly Rs 1,000 crore for alleged fraudulent trading in a 10-year-old case.

The company said it had full confidence in the judicial process and proposed to vigorously exercise all options available to challenge the untenable findings in the order.

Coal India announces dividend

The state-owned Coal India announced another interim dividend of Rs 1.15 per share of face value Rs 10 on Sunday. Following instructions from the government, Coal India (CIL) at a scheduled board meet decided to shell out another Rs 714 crore as dividends.

Earlier this month, CIL declared an interim dividend of Rs 18.75 per share of face value Rs 10 per share. Government being the single largest shareholder in the company with a 79.11 percent stake was entitled to receive Rs 9,208 crore, said a report.

Dollar pares losses

The US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, hit a seven-week low of 99.527 before the healthcare decision but pared losses after the announcement and was last marginally higher at 99.765, said a report.

Benchmark 10-year US Treasuries prices turned flat after the decision, with their yields last at 2.418 per cent after hitting a session low of 2.393 percent earlier.

Oil Output cut

A joint committee of ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers has agreed to review whether a global pact to limit supplies should be extended by six months, it said in a statement on Sunday.

Oil largely fell during the week as concerns persisted over an excess of crude. Brent crude settled up 24 cents, or 0.47 per cent, at $50.80 a barrel. U.S. crude settled up 27 cents, or 0.57 per cent, at $47.97.

Rupee may depreciate to 68-69/USD

The Indian rupee on Friday closed stronger against the US dollar as foreign investors continued to buy in local equities and debt markets.

The home currency closed at 65.42, up 0.19 per cent from its previous close of 65.53. On a Year to date basis, the rupee has gained 4 per cent supported by large buying by FIIs which have pumped close to USD 4.60 billion and $3.03 million from local equity and debt markets.

According to Edelweiss, the rupee will depreciate to 68-69 range by December 2017 and global political risks and strengthening of the US dollar could be the key factors affecting rupee as against the greenback.

Nifty forms ‘Doji’ pattern on charts

The Nifty index opened higher on Friday but failed to continue its momentum and made a 'Doji' type of pattern on daily charts which suggests that bulls might be losing their grip on the market. Traders are advised to stay long and maintain strict stop loss below 9,048.

A 'Doji' is formed when the index opens and then closes approximately around the same level but remain volatile throughout the day which is indicated by its long shadow on either side. It appears like a cross or a plus sign.

For the week, it will be important for the index to hold above 9,075-9,100 level to continue its journey towards 9,160-9218 levels. Recently, it took support at its 13 DEMA and formed a bottom near to 9,020 zone.",934,-0.22877611897208475

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Sarin shared his views on the likely merger of Vodafone and Idea Cellular. Freebies launched by Reliance Jio in September sent the telecom industry scampering for mergers and acquisitions to build size and take on the competition.

This, he says, would be good for the customer as the companies will compete aggressively on pricing. Currently, there are about 13 players in the industry.

The business advisory group said its survey also found that almost six in ten British consumers are concerned about their lack of disposable income.

Last week, official data showed British shoppers unexpectedly cut back on spending in January after last year's Brexit vote pushed up inflation - the strongest sign to date the UK economy is heading for a slowdown.

Consumers were barely fazed last year by June's decision to leave the European Union. But they are turning more cautious with prices rising quickly in response to the post-referendum slump in the value of the pound and higher oil prices.

PwC's survey of more than 1,000 UK shoppers found that price was still the most important factor for determining customer loyalty, with 59 percent of respondents saying they returned to a retailer because prices were good.

Other important reasons were trust in the brand (43 percent)and items being in stock (37 percent).

ICICI Securities analysed the Indian air traffic data for the month of January 2017.

It says passenger load factors (PLF) as well as traffic growth remain high with IndiGo, SpiceJet and Go Air maintaining PLFs at more than 90 percent in the domestic segment and overall domestic passenger growing by 25 percent in January 2017. Higher PLFs has led to widening of the gap between pax (passenger) growth and capacity growth in January 2017, which is one of the structural positive construct in Indian aviation.

PLF driven traffic growth is fundamentally better than capacity driven traffic growth, it feels. According to ICICI Securities, higher PLFs could partially be due to the advance sales which the airlines offered during the demonetisation time period (November-December 2016) and hence could remain elevated in February as well.

However, this also presents an opportunity for airlines to take yield hikes in the current booking window, especially with rising cost pressures, it feels.

Moneycontrol Bureau Reliance Industries’ scrip clocked multi-year high on Wednesday as investors cheered the announcements made by Chairman & Managing Director Mukesh Ambani for Jio customers. The stock had risen to this extent last in June 2009. On Wednesday, the scrip soared over 10 percent intraday on the BSE and was the biggest contributor to the Nifty. The stock in post afternoon trade hit Rs 1,200-mark for the first time since May 19, 2009.Analysts have largely hailed the pricing set by Jio for its customers. However, they have also raised a few issues related to the service quality and retention of customers. Goldman Sachs, in a report, said that nearly 10 percent of overall Indian mobile subscribers will likely view Jio’s pricing of Rs 303 as attractive. These subscribers have an average ARPU (average revenue per user) of Rs 600 and account for 40 percent of the industry’s revenues. According to Jeffries, the Rs 303-plan was the most ‘disruptive’ announcement by Jio. Given the way Jio's plans are structured and how incumbents have responded over the past quarter, “focus should be solely on ARPU which would also come under pressure,” said the Jefferies note to clients.CLSA also feels that the ‘more-for-more’ strategy of the company is targeted at high ARPU and retention. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse said that nearly 50 percent of revenues for incumbent operators like Bharti are from subscribers with Rs 300 + ARPU. The Rs 303-plan will put an ARPU ceiling on all such subscribers, it said. On challenges, Goldman Sachs feels that customer concerns around call failure and likely further cuts from rival telecom companies are the key hurdles for Jio. It estimates a 50 percent customer retention in FY18. CLSA feels that the compulsion on upfront payment may impact its subscriber retention. Jefferies also highlighted the challenge for Jio being the ability to maintain quality of services as there issues relating to point of interconnect and data speeds, which according to TRAI have been lower than Airtel. These would put to test Jio’s ability to retain customers once they start charging for services, it said.Credit Suisse continues stay ‘cautious’ on the stock price outlook for most listed telecom companies as Jio’s aggressive pricing plans will pressure their revenues, especially from high-value customers. CLSA says that Jio estimates assume 50 percent conversion of active 4G subscribers, aggregating to 8 percent sector revenues. If these conversions are higher, these will add incremental risks to the incumbent forecasts, the brokerage added. Ambani on February 21 announced a slew of offers for its existing Jio customers as a reward for their loyalty to their brand. At a one-time fee of Rs 99, existing Jio customers could get Jio’s services for one year at a price of Rs 303 per month from April 1, 2017. Jio notched the 100-million customer mark within just 170 days and was adding almost seven customers per second, he added. Expressing gratitude to Jio's first 100 million users, Mukesh Ambani said that for customers coming onboard before April 1 will be eligible to avail a 'Jio Prime' membership, enrolment for which will start from March 1 onwards.In the past one week, the stock has risen over 11 percent and has shown strong movements in the past three days as well, posting a near 9 percent gain.

Newcomer Reliance Jio has asked telecom regulator TRAI to ""impose highest penalty"" on Airtel, accusing the latter of grossly exaggerating the value of data in a promotional offer, and giving misleading tariff ads.

Jio has shot-off a letter to the telecom regulator alleging that in so far as the advertisements issued by Airtel for pre-paid and post-paid tariff packs are concerned, the unlimited calls and free data being offered by Airtel is in ""gross violation of extant telecommunication laws"".

Jio has further charged Airtel of misrepresenting the benefits as free unlimited calls without indicating the applicability of Fair Usage Policy (FUP).

It alleged that the free calls under Airtel's Special Tariff Voucher 345 were not really unlimited as Airtel has implemented a FUP of 300 minutes/day or 1,200 minutes/week, post which all calls are chargable.

""Therefore, these prepaid packs do not provide unlimited free calling to customers. This fact is not discernable from the advertisements of Airtel and neither does Airtel specify in the advertisements that such limitations apply or are conceived as part of the terms and conditions,"" Jio claimed.

It also claimed that FUP related information is provided only by call centre executives of Airtel and that too when the issue is specifically highlighted to them.

It said that this was violative and inconsistent with TRAI's instructions dated September 10, 2010.

On Airtel's advertisement of 'Free data for 12 months, worth Rs 9,000' on the prepaid STV of Rs 345, Jio alleged that the data benefits were available only on paying Rs 345 and therefore, could not be termed free.

""Further, post expiry of the data benefits in the pack, the subscriber is charged at pay-as-you-go rates, therefore, the free data claims are grossly misleading,"" it said.

Arguing that the value of 3GB data (at the rate of Rs 450 a month) would work out to only Rs 5,400 over 12 months, Jio said that the benefits are therefore ""much lower"" than Airtel's claim of Rs 9,000.

Jio has also accused Airtel of arbitrary discrimination between subscribers of same class, saying that offer (free data for 12 months) can be availed only by subscribers with new 4G handsets, that is 4G handsets that have previously not been used on Airtel's network.

This ""arbitrary classification"" by Airtel is a gross violation of the Telecom Tariff order 1999 Section IV (Transparency and Consumer Protection), Jio said.

""In view of the gross violation by Airtel of TRAI directions, instructions, tariff orders, we request the authority to take strongest action under the Act and impose highest penalty on Airtel,"" the letter said.Disclosure: Reliance Jio is part of Reliance Industries which also owns Network18 and Moneycontrol.com",453,-0.8383401036262512

Equity benchmarks closed off day's high for the second consecutive session Wednesday as investors eyed corporate earnings. Globally investors awaited Friday's inauguration of Donald Trump as US president. The Nifty reclaimed 8450 intraday after the tax department kept in abeyance its recent circular on indirect transfer of shares by foreign investors.

The 30-share BSE Sensex rose 21.98 points to 27257.64 and the 50-share NSE Nifty rose 19 points at 8417 while broader markets outperformed. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices gained around half a percent.

Experts expect the market to move gradually higher amid consolidation ahead of Union Budget, the next big trigger, on consistent support from domestic inflows.

Foreign outflows, though a cause for concern, are more technical than fundamental, Vikas Khemani of Edelweiss Securities says.

Since India was on top of most emerging market portfolios so far, it was natural to take the first hit in case of any global uncertainties, he noted, adding, a favourable Budget can reverse the trend.

Khemani does not see any major disappointment from corporate earnings yet. The market is keenly watching changes in corporate and long term capital gains taxation in the Budget and will certainly cheer if these are constructive, he says.

The market breadth was positive as about 1494 shares advanced against 1241 declining shares on the BSE.

1:30 pm Gold: Gold remained volatile in Asian trade on Friday and was set for its first weekly decline in four, with investors continuing to mull over the economic outlook after Republican Donald Trump won this week's U.S. presidential election.

US gold futures were down 0.4 percent at USD 1,261.60 per ounce after falling as much as 1.3 percent to a four-week low of USD 1250.40 earlier. The dollar hovered near a 3-1/2-month high versus the yen, after making big gains overnight as the markets prepared for a Donald Trump presidency that could stimulate the U.S. economy fiscally and lift interest rates.

The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates more quickly if Washington used lower taxes or higher spending to boost economic growth, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said on Thursday. Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.

""We expect Reliance Jio to gain less than a 2 per cent revenue market share in 2017, but to act a major price-disruptor,"" it said in a note today.

The top four existing telcos will consolidate their revenue market share by eating into the revenues of the smaller players, it said.

The agency expects Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular and Rcom/Aircel's market share to go up to 84 per cent from 79 per cent in 2016.

It can be noted that the Mukesh Ambani-led company has invested Rs 1.5 trillion for the service so far, and has earmarked another Rs 1 trillion capex by 2020, which has been launched with many firsts like free lifetime voice telephony and cheaper data prices. It is offering its services for free till end of the year.

Earlier this week, Ambani had asserted that Jio is a well thought-out venture and not a ""punt"".

""First and foremost, it is no punt. It is a well-thought, well-executed, well-engineered ecosystem. It is a Rs 2,50,000 crore investment,"" Ambani had said in a media interaction last week.

Fitch said the intense competition will weaken the credit profiles, and coupled with the high capital expenditure requirements, gave it a negative outlook.

The industry's revenue growth could slow down to mid single-digit from 7-8 per cent in 2016 on lower data revenue growth, where it expects tariffs to fall by up to 20 per cent.

The pre-tax profit margins of the top four telcos, which stood at 34 per cent in 2016, will be hit by up to 2 percentage points, it said, attributing it to lower tariffs and increased marketing spend as data competition rises.

The free cash flows will be negative as cash generation is likely to fall short of capex requirements, the report said.

It said Rcom's plan to demerge its wireless business is credit neutral - as the demerger will take away an equal proportion of debt and pretax profit from the company.

On its stable outlook for the Anil Ambani-led company, the company said it is based on the expectation that Rcom will use the proceeds from the sale of tower assets to improve leverage.(Disclosure: Reliance Jio is part of Reliance Industries which owns Network18 Media and moneycontrol.com)",414,-0.19499585777521133

Telecom companies today told the Supreme Court that entire sector is under huge debt and they have to pay big price for spectrum, therefore zero tolerance on call drops should not be imposed on them.

Refuting the allegations of TRAI that the telecom service providers are making huge gains in the sector, the companies told the apex court that they have been investing hugely on the infrastructure.

""They (TRAI) said that we have been making Rs 250 crore a day but what was not specified was that we are under huge debt. We have to pay over Rs 3.8 lakh crores as debt. We are buying spectrum at Rs 45,000 crore, which was earlier Rs 1,658 crore.

""We are not gaining anything and our rate of return is less than one percent at the end of a year,"" senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for telecom operators, told a bench comprising Justices Kurian Joseph and RF Nariman. The bench reserved its verdict on the issue.

Sibal said that TRAI had compared India with China but in that country the spectrum is given for free to the top three telecom companies which are state run.

Sibal said that like TRAI worries for consumers, so do the telecom companies and no one wants the call drop to happen but the factors responsible are beyond their control.

""Our tariff is lowest in the world. We are serving over one billion subscribers in India and we are one of the largest contributor to FDI and provide a million of jobs,"" Sibal said.

He said that although Telecom companies have largest subscriber base in India but have the lowest revenue and also the Industry's revenue is gradually going down.

Sibal refuted the allegations of TRAI that Telecom companies are not investing on technology and towers and said that in past 15 months over two lakh towers have been installed.

""We have installed over two lakh towers in past 15 months and every third minute a tower is being installed. What has been done in past fifteen months has not been done in past 20 years,"" he said.

Indian refiners together imported 506,100 bpd oil from Iran last month, a jump of about 135 percent from February, the data showed. In March of last year, the refiners halted imports from Iran to keep shipments within the parameters of the temporary nuclear deal then in force.

The higher imports by India signals Tehran's success in beginning to regain market share after the lifting of Western sanctions targeting its nuclear programme.

Iran has said it will continue increasing its oil production and exports until it reaches the market position it held before the imposition of sanctions. [nL5N1770E8]

In the fiscal year ended on March 31, Indian refiners shipped in 14.4 percent more oil from Iran at about 251,100 bpd, the data showed. The increase was the largest annual growth since the 2007/08 fiscal year, according to Reuters data.

Essar Oil was the biggest importer of Iranian oil in March with about 207,400 bpd oil, followed by about 130,000 bpd by Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd and about 90,600 bpd by Reliance, its first shipments in about six years.

Reliance had halted Iranian oil imports in 2010 because it was worried that the threat of U.S. sanctions on companies doing business with the Islamic republic would complicate its efforts to boost market share for its fuels in the United States.

Last month Reliance imported Forozan grade and South Pars condensate from Iran, the data showed.

Indian Oil Corp , the country's biggest refiner and not a regular buyer of Iranian oil, shipped in 2 million barrels or about 67,000 bpd from Tehran last month.

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India in July 2014 had recommended a comprehensive plan for improving telecom services in ANI and Lakshadweep island with an outlay of about Rs 2,900 crore.

The DoT in a detailed project report prepared by state-run BSNL found two of the components, satellite capacity increase in Lakshadweep and optical fibre connectivity within ANI, suggested by the regulator are costing about double the amount computed by Trai and hence sought its view on the estimates.

Trai in its reply said the estimation of the investment required was done by the it on the basis of costs data inputs provided by the telecom operators including BSNL and based on certain valid assumptions.

""The authority does not have any other source to examine the item-wise costs mentioned in the DPR. Moreover, preparing or vetting Detailed Project Report is not a function of TRAI.

It is for DoT to take a decision on the matter,"" Trai said.

The regulator said it has been almost 20 months since the recommendations were made in July 2014 and costs and need for replacement of infrastructure may vary with time.

Trai in its recommendation laid primary importance of connecting these islands through undersea cable which is dependent on connectivity from satellite only for telecom services.

The regulator said decision about the cost of project based on factors such as the availability and suitability of existing telecom infrastructure, their residual life etc can be taken by DoT.

""Keeping in view that the broad objectives outlined by the Authority in its recommendations on the Comprehensive Telecom Plan of ANI and Lakshadweep are fulfilled even if the estimated costs of the project(s) is somewhat more than the costs estimated by the Authority,"" Trai said.

The regulator has recommended that besides connecting these regions with cables, satellite connectivity should be retained in parts of both of these union territories.

In Andaman and Nicobar Island (ANI) 29 out of 576 islands are inhabited and 90 per cent of the population lives in three islands - North, Middle and South Andaman Islands alone. In Lakshadweep, 11 out of 36 are inhabited and 10 of the inhabited islands have population above 100.

For Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the regulator has suggested connecting 22 islands, which included 18 islands with population of above 100 and four islands which have presence of police, forest camps and tourists.

For Lakshadweep, the regulator has factored connectivity at 10 inhabited villages.

The islands are a part of the West Bengal service area and Lakshadweep is a part of the Kerala circle.

In Andaman & Nicobar Islands, four telecom operators - BSNL, Airtel, Vodafone and Reliance - have launched services.

In Lakshadweep, only BSNL and Airtel (partly) have launched services.

While in the rest of West Bengal and Kerala service areas there are eight telecom operators.",507,

As far as China is concerned, Mowat feels the situation is becoming less precarious and the pressure on the Chinese currency (yuan) is easing now. He does not see China dragging India lower, instead feels it is the repositioning of portfolios that has dragged the country lower.Don't miss: Ready to ease if market rout hurts economy: BOJ's Kuroda

RBI, on Wednesday, gave licenses to 11 entities to open payment banks.The concept to payment banks is on same lines as those of PayPal or Paytm. These banks collect small deposits from its customers and make payments, on their behalf, to other parties. A payment bank cannot give loans. It will just make payment on behalf of its customers. Opening payment banks will open the era of cashless transactions across the world. Big names like Reliance, Bharti Airtel, Birla, Vodafone, Mahindra and startups, namely Paytm, have been given the license. Indian Post and NSDL have also been roped in considering their wide reach. The key trigger for these differentiated licenses is to bank the unbanked. A year or two from now, the direct benefit transfers (DBT) from the government will happen into mobile wallets and people in rural as well as urban areas will be able pay for groceries through mobile and account in SBI’s payment bank. In a probable scenario, it will be urban India that will first open payment bank accounts to pay cab drivers, vegetable vendors and our pizza delivery boys.These companies will be able to make money via float of cash or by charging for services rendered. Right now, legacy banks believe that the money will come from services. The payment service may evolve much like banks provide free ATM services.The big fallout of this system could be phase out of cash payments in day-to-day lives. However, another huge incidental positive could be that monetary transmission will improve. In the past and even today, a rate hike by the RBI does not touch half the population because they don’t have a bank account.

10:20 am Oil volatile: The reason behind the fall and rise in oil prices yesterday, according to Miswin Mahesh of Barclays, is the fact that the Iranian nuclear agreement still needs to be approved within the Congress in the US. They have 60 days to do that. Despite US President Barack Obama firm statement that he will veto any opposition to it, it is still important. Secondly, even after the Congress approval in September, actual oil from Iran will hit the market only in the fourth quarter.

There are also a few other roadblocks to go through in terms of Iranian oil hitting the market. The first tranche that would hit the market would be the 40 million barrels of oil Iran has on oil tankers, says Mahesh. This will hit the market first after the European insurance sanctions are removed on tanker shipments, he told CNBC-TV18.

Iran has the fifth largest oil reserves in the world. Despite the fact that Iran will be opening its oil sector to foreign companies, oil contracts will play a key role here, he says. While foreign companies are extremely keen to go to Iran, a lot will depend on how attractive it will be for major oil companies around the world to go to there and start rejuvenating the oil fields, he adds.

1:45 pm Market outlook: Market masters say there is a super sale going on in Indian equities and retail investors should jump the bandwagon or repent later for missing the bus. However, the velocity of uptrend, which is based on monetary, fiscal and currency stimuli, is capped as of today, says Manish Gunwani, Senior Fund Manager at ICICI Pru AMC. In an interview to CNBC-TV18, he says holding up of the stimuli is actually setting up base for a strong bull run ahead. In the short run, the macros may look tough, but long term is undoubtedly good. However, a big meltdown from here is unlikely and banks, capital goods and cement are looking quite attractive from medium term perspective. Since we have growth at cyclical lows, there's a lot of scope for rate cuts which should happen to boost economy, he said. He suggests looking at good quality private sector banks, which have been growing faster than nominal GDP.

The telecom department panel that was set up to look into the Net neutrality issue has submitted its report to Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and the report will be made public in a few days.

“Yes, they (the panel) have submitted the report to me. In few days time, the report will be put on the web site, you can see and access it. I have asked the Secretary to send a copy to TRAI, so that they can also have a look at it,” Prasad said at the press meet marking a year of the Modi government.

Net neutrality implies equal treatment be accorded to all internet traffic and no priority should be given to any person or entity or company based on payment, which is seen as discriminatory.

“The decision (on net neutrality) will be taken by the government and the Cabinet. The government will have the benefit of both the reports namely of my department and TRAI. I would expect that report to be expedited,” he said.

Apart from the six-member committee appointed in January this year by DoT, TRAI had also invited comments from stakeholders on issues like Net neutrality and regulation of OTT services like WhatsApp and Skype.

Net Neutrality, a widely debated issue globally, has in the past few weeks caught India’s attention with politicians, corporate leaders and film stars taking to social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook to debate on the issue.

Net neutrality gained national attention after Internet activists and experts flagged telecom giant Bharti Airtel’s ’Airtel Zero’ platform to be in violation of the principle.

Airtel Zero is an open marketing platform that allows customers to access a variety of mobile applications for free, with the data charges being paid by start-ups and large firms.

Its fourth quarter consolidated profit shot up 124.63 percent sequentially (down 44 percent year-on-year) to Rs 888 crore. Weak operational performance dented bottomline on year-on-year basis.

Total income declined by 11.1 percent quarter-on-quarter (up 51.7 percent on yearly basis) to Rs 6,157 crore during January-March quarter, the company said in its filing.

However, analysts do not seem to be perturbed. Macquaire has an outperform rating with a target price of Rs 1100 per share. With strong execution, free cash flow and a niche pipeline, Sun Pharma should sustain the upper-end of its historical premium valuation, says the brokerage. Ranbaxy integration provides an additional lever for growth, over the medium-term, it adds.

Equity benchmarks surged for the second straight session Monday, even as players are divided on whether the rally can sustain.

The 30-share Sensex closed at 27507.30, up 401.91 points or 1.48 percent over its previous close. The Nifty closed at 8325.25, up 133.75 points or 1.63 percent.

In the last two sessions, the Sensex has risen around 908 points and the Nifty around 268 points.

There was good demand for mid cap shares too, with S&P BSE Midcap Index gaining over 2 percent.

Brokers attributed much of the rise in the last of couple of sessions to short covering of positions, and said there was not much of fresh buying by institutional investors.

They said the possibility of the Fed deferring its rate hike beyond June, or even September, further boosted sentiment.

“We think this (latest jobs data) will not be enough for the Fed to move in June maybe not even September because both we have seen is average hourly earnings are still stuck somewhat in a trading range, year-over-year (Y-o-Y) that number is up 2.2 percent which is not quite enough for the Fed to make a move,” Hans Goetti, head of investment-Asia, Banque Internationale, said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

“Our base case is a move by the Fed in September at the earliest could just as well be a little bit late to maybe December or even 2016,” he said.

Auto, bank and metal shares were the star performers of the day. FMCG shares were the biggest laggards.

Many market experts feel valuations are looking attractive after the near 10 percent decline from the record highs in March.

“If you are a late comer to the party or a little sceptical around the edges this is actually an entry opportunity and you should be buying now,” said Dipan Sheth of HDFC Securities in an interview to CNBC-TV18 today.

“It doesn’t mean markets can’t fall, of course not, they can, but the downside from here on looks limited and the upsides look much more promising than what they did maybe a month or two ago,” he said.

Players tracking technical indicators say the Nifty holding above its 200-day moving average (DMA) is a reassuring sign.

“The crossover of the 50 DMA and the 200 DMA are important signals for long-term trends on the market,” said Dipen Mehta, BSE & NSE member, in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

“I think that if you go back to 2003 to 2007 bull market, there were five occasions where the 200 DMA was breached briefly for a few trading sessions and that acted as a support level and the markets rebounded from there,” he said.

Bank of Baroda was among the prominent gainers of the day, with the stock rising 17 percent. The company’s fourth quarter earnings fell short of market expectations, but improvement in asset quality was better than what analysts had estimated.

Moreover, the MSCI India has fallen 28 percent versus MSCI China since March to April. However, now since China has already seen a strong move, people would wait for consolidation to add further exposure there and would look at India that has now come back to a level which is a good support, he adds.

1:45 pm Macro economy: Growth in India's dominant services industry continued to lose momentum in April as domestic demand softened, a business survey showed on Wednesday.

Coupled with a slowing manufacturing sector and falling inflation, the findings are likely to strengthen expectations that the Reserve Bank of India will cut interest rates for the third time this year, possibly before its next scheduled policy review on June 2.

1:30 pm Big bull: The Indian stock market has corrected enough over the past few weeks and the thesis remains that local equities are in a sustainable long-term run, as compared to countries like China where shares have seen a ‘poor quality’ rally.

That’s the view of Samir Arora of Singapore-based Helios Capital, who has upped the net exposure of his long-short hedge fund by 5-7 percent. (Arora’s current net long exposure is not known but in February this year, he said his position then stood at 63-64 percent.)

“As opposed to 2014, which was a long-only year, we expect this year to be long-short,” he said, while maintaining that investors should expect 12-15-18 percent kind of returns from stocks this year.

On the issue that has had investors the most worried, Arora said that even if earnings were muted in the current fiscal year (at about 10-12 percent growth), they will likely make up for it in the following year and that on a 2016-17 basis, shares were priced at a reasonable 16-17 times earnings.

12:40pm Jefferies on Tata Motors: Brokerage house Jefferies feels the market underestimating the value of Tata Motors’ domestic business.

“As troubled as the business is today, the signs of turnaround are visible, the extent of margin improvement significant and contribution to overall value material. Recently announced equity issuance is long overdue and welcome in the interest of risk mitigation,” the Jefferies note to clients says.

The brokerage has raised target price of the company ‘marginally’ to Rs 669.

Jefferies sees Tata Motors medium and heavy commercial vehicle sales volumes growing 23.5 percent over FY15-17 boosted by recovery in commercial vehicle cycle.

“Passenger vehicle sales will likely grow 22.3 percent in this period on the back of new products (2 launched, 2 more in 1HFY16), recovering from an extremely low base. Combined, we expect ASP (average selling price) to grow 6.3 percent and per unit costs to grow around 0.3 percent, resulting in EBIT margins increasing to 2.6 percent in FY17E, still about 600 basis points below peak,” says the note.

While the overall average wage hike would be effective from April 1, which is 1-2.5 percent for onsite and 6.5 percent for offshore, higher performers would get a hike of 9.5 percent and the top performers would get 15-20 percent hike. For this, per team one to two percent of the top most employees have been scrutinized, say sources.

This step would not only encourage people to work better by increasing utilisation but also help the company contain attrition. This is the highest hike by company had done in the last three years for top performers.

JP Morgan’s Jahangir Aziz says central banks in some countries have had to answer the governments if the inflation target was missed for three quarters in a row.

He said the arrangement gives a fair degree of independence to the RBI, and said this will also lead to greater scrutiny of the Monetary Policy Committee’s decisions.

Certain core issues have been plaguing the Railways for many years now and if Suresh Prabhu has to bring the railways back on track, there is a need for some radical decisions on that front as well.

1:55 pm Oil market: Oil markets edged up to halt a two-day drop, helped by expectations that data later in the day would show a continued decline in the US oil rig count, a clear sign of the pressure the tumble in crude has put on crude producers.

A weekly survey by Baker Hughes last week showed the US oil rig count fell to its lowest since August 2011, although government data indicated US oil output was 9.2 million barrels a day, the highest since 1973. ""I assume we're going to continue to see another big fall and that's going to provide support for the market,"" said Tony Nunan, a risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp in Tokyo.

In an exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18, JSPL MD and CEO Ravi Uppal said the company was not comfortable with the prices that were being quoted for the mine in question. “We have known that mine intimately as we were operating it for 12 to 14 years. We quoted a price that we were comfortable with. But it did not qualify.”

JSPL had been previously operating blocks IV/1, 2 and 3 and while 2 and 3 (which it won back yesterday) was for the regulated power sector, block 1 was for the unregulated sector (steel, cement and iron).

Despite high valuations, Dennis remains overweight on India. He believes valuations should be high as he expects earnings growth to be 15-16 percent in dollar terms in two years.

Share markets were mostly lower following a soft finish on Wall Street though sentiment was supported by speculation the Federal Reserve would be patient in tightening policy given the weakness of wages apparent in the jobs numbers. Wages fell by the most since the series began in 2006 even as payrolls increased by a brisk 252,000.

11:30 am Truce: Coal India unions, protesting against a move to open up the industry to private firms, called off a five-day strike on its second day on Wednesday after a meeting with the coal and power minister, staving off a looming power crisis.

The company accounts for about 80 percent of India's total output and strikes have previously crippled power plants, hampering government efforts to reform the coal industry. Coal fuels 60 percent of the country's power production.

Coal India struggled to produce and ship less than half of its daily target on Tuesday, the first day of the strike, threatening to exacerbate a shortage of the fuel.

A union leader said they decided to end the strike late on Wednesday after minister Piyush Goyal agreed to form a committee to look into any issues with a recently passed executive order, which would allow private companies to mine and sell the fuel for the first time in 42 years.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken direct control of a project-monitoring body to fast-track investments worth almost USD 300 billion and revive manufacturing in the country, two officials with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Industrial output contracted in October in its worst performance in three years, jarring with a much-publicised ""Make in India"" campaign Modi has championed to make the country a manufacturing powerhouse.

By taking over the Project Monitoring Group (PMG), which was previously in the Cabinet Secretariat, Modi could help firms planning coal, power, steel and infrastructure projects cut through a maze of up to 180 clearances.

1:50 pm SpiceJet woes: With troubled SpiceJet having grounded its flights, oil companies have made it clear the budget carrier will get fuel only on immediate payments, as the airline is on 'cash and carry' mode.

The carrier had till yesterday bought some jet fuel but it has not made any request for cash purchase since last evening and so no aircraft of SpiceJet has been refuelled, industry sources said. SpiceJet had been put on cash-and-carry about six months back, which meant fuel will be supplied to the aircraft only if they pay for it, they said.

SpiceJet used to buy about Rs 5.5 crore worth of fuel daily from Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) but six months back it shifted some purchases to Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and Reliance Industries. The daily offtake had since then fallen due to groundingof several of its aircraft and SpiceJet cutting back its fleet.

The downtrend could persist next week followed the disastrous October IIP figure of negative 4.2 percent announced post market Friday. While inflation continued to drift lower, weakness in industrial output during the festive season is clearly a cause for concern.

Tata Steel, Sesa Sterlite, GAIL, BHEL, JSPL, Reliance and ONGC, L&T, Cairn India and Infosys slid between 6-12.5 percent lower, faring among biggest Nifty losers this week.

Sun Pharma, Coal India, UltraTech Cement, ITC bucked the trend, gaining between 1-2.4 percent this week.

Weakness was ubiquitous this week, with broader markets at the center of profit-taking. BSE Small Cap and CNX Midcap indices were down 3.4-3.8 percent, performing slightly better than the benchmarks.

Diamond Power, Bombay Burmah, HCL Info, Havells, India Cements, HDIL, Rel Comm, HCC and Unitech lost between 10-43 percent on the bourses, on a weekly basis. Investors booked profits this week amid weak global cues and mixed signals domestically. The start of the week saw India's current account deficit widen to US$10.1bn in the second quarter of 2014-15 from US$7.8bn (1.7% of GDP) in the preceding quarter. A bump in imports and slowing of exports led to the widening of the gap. The Finance Minister however said there was no cause for concern since FII and FDI flows were adequate to finance the deficit.

Globally, Chinese benchmark Shanghai Composite fell almost 6 percent sending shockwaves in the region in particular and the rest of the world in general. The blame was put on new restrictions imposed by the government on corporate bond market and subdued growth outlook for the country.

Stocks of metal companies, which depend on exports to China took a beating owing to weakness in China.

The scenario wasn't all rosy back home either as some of the founders sold their stake in the blue-chip software behemoth -Infosys- which gently rattled investor sentiment and caused turmoil in benchmark indices on that day, somewhat setting a precedent for profit taking for the week ahead.

Government's reforms agenda has taken a blow on the chin, as latest reports from CNBC-TV18 suggest that the much awaited GST Bill might be tabled in the budget session of the parliament in 2015 and not in the ongoing winted session, owing to ongoing differences between centre and states on inclusion of petroleum in the bill's ambit among other issues.

This weakness hasn't deterred Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint MD, Motilal Oswal, who in an interview with CNBC-TV18 that market could see a correction near term, but it made sense only for traders to book profits now and get in at lower prices. For those looking to benefit from the secular bull market over the next few years, it would pay to sit tight and ignore market fluctuations.

Energy stocks slumped as oil prices hit five and half year lows even as IEA lowered it's demand outlook. Brent crude which was last seen trading at USD63-a-barrel, has dropped 40 percent since July. BSE oil & gas index lost 7.3 percent owing to a weak demand.

About 1346 shares have advanced, 1734 shares declined, and 116 shares are unchanged.

China’s unexpected rate cut by the central bank, first time in two years, boosted metal stocks as it currently consumes around half of the world's metals. What added to the euphoria is hope of a stimulus as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi threw the door wide open for more drastic measures to prevent the euro zone from sliding into deflation, promising to use whatever means.

Experts are still betting on India's outperformance. Manishi Raychaudhuri, Asia Pacific Equity Strategist at BNP Paribas retains his overweight stance on Indian equities. However, he warns that India may consolidate at current levels having outperformed so sharply as valuations are becoming worrisome.

Moreover, given the current scenario, the Reserve Bank of India may not cut rates on December 2, he adds. Although India remains one of the best games in town amongst emerging markets (EMs), incremental outflows can be seen flowing into north Asia, specifically China and Korea in near-term, he says in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

11:55 am View on China rate cut: Shaun Rein, China Mkt Research Group, in an interview to CNBC-TV18, said rate cut by the People's Bank of Chian doesn’t necessarily mean there will be a massive quantitative easing but could be targeted easing.

It is possible that there could be reserve ratio cut in the next quarter, he adds.

According to him rate cut in China could mean other regions like EU might too reduce some rates which might lead to fund flows into equities, so one could see strength into Asian equities like in Hang Seng or Hong Kong over the next day or two but the government may not do too much because the credit problems still persists.

The Chinese government is in a difficult position right not to get its economy moving which is why it has cut rates but at the same time the unemployment numbers are still strong, salaries continue to go up and there are still very real weakness in non-performing loans.

Even the industrial output (IIP) for September is expected to come at 2 percent versus 0.4 percent in August.

CPI-based inflation eased for the second month in a row to 6.46 percent in September, compared with a downward revised 7.73 percent a month ago. It is expected to come in at its lowest since the new index was started on the back of a recovery in monsoon, which prevented food inflation from becoming a nasty shock.

Following the trend of past three months, one can see that food inflation peaked in July and after that it has been falling month-on-month. In July, it stood up 2.7 percent against the previous, while it fell by 1.6 percent and 0.3 percent in August and September, respectively. October prices are expected to be down by about 7 percent against September on a sharp fall in vegetable and cereal prices.

However, industrial output numbers (IIP), expected at 2 percent, could be bit of negative news. According to the poll, it can range from 1 to 2 percent, while many respondents also gave zero as the expected IIP growth, which means no growth at all.

1:30 pm: Macro outlook: The down tick seen in the consumer price index (CPI) number yesterday could be a one-off. In fact, the next few months could see headline CPI inflation moving higher, believes Sonal Varma, India Economist, Nomura Financial Advisory & Securities. She is expecting the number to inch back up to 8.5 percent. And there could be two factors responsible for that. One, the current adverse weather conditions in India like the unseasonal winter rains, hailstorms in certain part of India and the El Nino phenomena could again pose a risk to food inflation and vegetable prices may go up.

Two, the moderation seen in core CPI was mainly because of transport and communication segment and if one excludes that then the number was indeed higher said Varma. ""The underlying services segments of CPI still remains very sticky, some segments like medical, education which are relatively inelastic as compared to some of the other items like personal care which are more elastic to demand,"" she said.

Therefore, he expects the upward momentum in banking to continue in the run-up to elections, so is positive on the space for the short-term. However, for the medium-term he is negative because the fundamental problems still remain and the economy is not going to suddenly show signs of revival just because a new government with majority comes in.

Similarly, on back of a hope rally Larsen and Toubro could see an upside to the tune of 5-7 percent in the near term but from medium-term outlook, it seems to have run its course and so the house remains negative on the stock says Damania.

The brokerage house expects the trend of forced fiscal austerity to continue next year.

According to them, the true picture will be known only in July post elections.

Government’s projections on asset sales and tax revenues for FY15 are optimistic, Nomura said.

There’s some good news for the auto company and capital Goods as the excise duty was cut for small cars to 8 percent from 12 percent earlier, 20 percent on large and mid-segment cars and excise duty has been reduced to 24 percent from 30 percent earlier on SUV,"" he added.

""Rich people who earn more than rupees 1 crore a year will have an extra impact as per the budget as they have to pay a extra 10 percent surcharge on their income. The finance minister exempted rice from the service tax ambit which now stands at 12 percent. There was no change in corporate rate tax rate for domestic companies and foreign companies which stand at 33.99 percent and 43.26 percent percent respectively,"" Gadia said.

02:20pm Shikha Sharma talks to CNBC-TV18

FM in the Interim Budget announced that total planned expenditure would be cut and the cut would come in this quarter.

According to Shikha Sharma, MD & CEO, Axis Bank to the extent that the planned expenditure is going to be lower is already factored into the numbers since it is already February 17 today. “So the expenditure number for next six weeks is not going to have that much of an impact in terms of growth or orders,” said Sharma

According to her despite this being a Vote-on-Account, there has been a positive trigger for the auto sector.

Commenting on the borrowing number being revised lower to Rs 5.79 lakh crores, Sharma said: “If the borrowing number is as what has been put out in the plan then that would be positive for the bond markets but there is still scepticism around on where the revenue numbers are going to happen and therefore if the borrowing number can be contained.”

So, I don’t think the bond markets are going to react at this point of time until all numbers are clear, she said

If Arvind Kejriwal is making strong allegations against how gas prices are being fixed, and how Reliance may be benefitting at the cost of the economy, the UPA government has largely itself to blame.

In announcing a dubious way of fixing gas prices last year, the government made itself vulnerable to such charges. As we noted in Firstpost last year, there was no tearing hurry to announce a decision for 2014 back then, when a government may change, and the entire global energy scenario may be different. Not only has the UPA tied down the next government to a seriously flawed decision, but its motives in doing so are also suspect.

Real reform is what the US did with shale gas, which is to free exploration and domestic pricing. You don't fix prices through a government and call it reform. If you fix prices, instead of letting the market determine the price, you are likely to be accused of collusion with businessmen. You have handed a propaganda coup to Kejriwal - whose remedies are unlikely to help reduce energy prices either.

Among the follies announced last year were the decision to fix KG gas prices at around $8 per mmBtu based on a complex formula. There is no reason why pricing should be announced in dollars. Remember the criticism of the Enron deal? Why price power in dollars when the revenues are all in rupee? The same logic should apply to the Indian gas pricing scene. Why should the Indian consumer, and possibly the taxpayer, take on the exchange risk of India-produced gas?

Moreover, how can a committee - or bureaucrat-decided price - be called reform? Do bureaucrats know better than the market? If the logic for allowing a price increase is that import prices are higher currently, one wonders what would happen if global prices crash? The only move that can be called reform is market-based pricing - where businesses take both the risks and rewards of global and domestic price movements.

The pricing decision announced last June, and especially the explanation given by Finance Minister P Chidambaram, involved gas output prices and not input prices for user industries - which meant the government had decided how much money gas producers, ONGC and Reliance among them, will make, but not how much gas users (power, fertiliser consumers) should pay. This is utter stupidity.

Chidambaram said: ""At the moment we are fixing only output prices, the price payable to gas producers. This will indeed have an impact on the consumer, but those prices are not being fixed today.....What is the price at which it should be supplied to a power plant, to a fertiliser plant, in order to make power affordable, fertiliser affordable... that can still be decided between now and April 1 (2014).""

This begs the question: if input prices for power and fertiliser can be decided later, why rush to decide output prices nearly a year in advance? When the two are inter-linked, it's like trying to have your cake today, and leaving the job of cleaning up the mess to someone else in 2014.

Then, any fixing of input at a lower price than output price will mean a bloating of subsidies. Who will pay this? The taxpayer, or somebody else? In the case of oil subsidies, both taxpayers and public sector oil companies have carried the can for the government's political decisions. Will the same happen with gas now? Will ONGC and GAIL bear the subsidies? This would be a disaster, and a clear case of misgovernance. ONGC shareholders should be suing the government if that happens.

The UPA's intentions appear suspect and mala fide - and it didn't need a Kejriwal to tell us this. If the benefits of a gas price hike are to be had upfront and the costs will be shifted to the next government (which will have to take the painful decision of bearing more subsidies, or reducing the gas price at the output end), this is clearly a scorched-earth policy. The UPA has essentially lobbed a ticking time-bomb to the next government.

It appears that the gas price announcement was intended to achieve two non-reform goals of the UPA: given the drastic fall in the rupee, the government needed the market to perk up in order to reverse capital outflows last year; it also needed a buoyant stock market to meet its fiscal deficit target. These targets can be met only if public sector shares can be sold to investors. In June, foreign institutional investors sold equity and debt to the tune of over Rs 40,000 crore. The gas price announcement temporarily reversed that trend. But reform cannot be about meeting these kinds of goals. Or pandering to FIIs.

Even if gas pricing is intended to induce new investments in petrocarbon exploration, it cannot be done in isolation. The energy sector comprises oil, gas, coal, coal-bed methane and shale gas, too. If you want to reform the sector, you have to reform pricing in all of them, not just gas. By raising gas prices, and leaving other prices and sectors as they are, the government is clearly worsening its energy sector problems. The only way to reform is to let prices of fuels find their own levels, so that businesses can make a rational decision on which fuel to use for what kind of output.

The doubling of gas prices is widely seen as a favour to gas producers. It may well be that, but in the long-term, it will actually damage the gas sector. When you double prices by fiat, the chances are that gas users will go into losses; they will have to be rescued either by the taxpayer or banks. And future demand for gas-based fertiliser and power plants will be curbed. Who will the gas producers sell to then?

In the US, when the government decided to boost shale gas production, it did not set any price. The market did that. This brought in new investment, and competition - and today natural gas prices at the US's Henry Hub are below USD 4 per mmBtu. And here we are, trying to double that price and calling it reform.

It is difficult to believe that the UPA's gas price move was at all intended to reform anything beyond putting out the fire in the economy's backyard - where the rupee was clearly going down in flames last June. Real reform is what the US did with shale gas.And we didn't need Kejriwal - an anti-market rabble-rouser - to remind us of this.

The market continued to consolidate around 6050 level on the Nifty from last week. Investors will closely watch January consumer price index (CPI) and December industrial output data due on Wednesday while globally all eyes are on first speech by Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair.

Tata group, banks and technology stocks supported the market while capital goods and healthcare stocks were under pressure.

The BSE Sensex rose 29.10 points to 20,363.37 and the NSE Nifty was up 9.25 points to 6,062.70.

Experts said the market will continue to trade in a tight range though there is a possibility of breaking 5900 level on the Nifty in near term.

Gautam Shah, Associate Director & Technical Analyst, JM Financial feels the Nifty will broadly trade in the range of 5950-6350. However, he adds that the near term trend looks weak. At worse, he feels Nifty may hit 5700 levels in the near-term.

Meanwhile, Dilip Bhat, joint MD, Prabhudas Lilladher believes muted foreign flows can possibly upset the market in the short run. Foreign institutional investors sold nearly Rs 1,800 crore worth of equity shares in February (till February 10). In fact, they started selling in India after the Federal Reserve reduced monthly fiscal stimulus by USD 10 billion to USD 65 billion and indicated that tapering will continue.

Trade deficit for January declined at USD 9.92 billion as against USD 10.14 billion in previous month and USD 18.97 billion in a year-ago period.

Imports increased (down 18.1 percent on yearly basis) to USD 36.67 billion versus USD 36.49 billion on month-on-month basis while exports jumped (3.8 percent Y-o-Y) to USD 26.75 billion from USD 26.35 billion M-o-M.

Tata Motors kept its top position in the buying list, rising 3 percent after December quarter net profit trebled year-on-year to Rs 4,805 crore. It was driven mainly by an exceptional income in the local standalone business and a robust performance at its British subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover.

CLSA has upgraded the stock to buy and raised target price to Rs 450 per share from Rs 405 per share.

Tata Steel gained 2 percent ahead of Q3 earnings due later in the day. HDFC, ICICI Bank and ONGC climbed over a percent.

Infosys was up 0.8 percent and TCS rose 0.35 percent. Nasscom expects the IT sector exports to grow by 13-15 percent as against 13 percent (Y-o-Y) in FY15. The domestic IT market is expected to grow 9-12 percent and the additional FY15 revenue will be USD 13-14 billion in FY15, said Nasscom.

However, Reliance Industries extended its fall in late trade, losing 2 percent. Hero Motocorp and NTPC too lost 2 percent each.

Hindalco Industries plunged 2 percent after Novelis’ October-December quarter earnings. Subsidiary reported net income of USD 13 million on net sales of USD 2.4 billion.

Dr Reddy’s Labs slipped 0.67 percent despite strong earnings in December ended quarter. Net profit of the pharmaceutical firm jumped 70 percent year-on-year to Rs 618.53 crore and net sales grew 23.3 percent to Rs 3,533.76 crore driven by global generics.",509,0.1987360566854477

AK Purwar, former chairman of State Bank of India and industry expert feels this time more licences may be issued. According to him, the focus could be on organisations which can work for financial inclusion and highly specialised institutions focusing on infrastructure, healthcare education, services sector, among others.

These issues may lead to a larger number of licences being issued this time. Santosh Singh, banking analyst, Espirito Santo Securities, feels NBFCs getting a bank licnence may not be a positive.

11:40 am Macro outlook: There is no way foreign investor community can choose to ignore India, says Naina Lal Kidwai, country head at HSBC India.

Although Investments have slowed down considerably and the current environment is still fragile, Kidwai is ready to bet on good agricultural growth and rural demand as positives that would lead to a pick-up in the economy. India can clock GDP growth of 5.5-6.5 percent in FY15 if things improve, and most of it will be visible after elections when clarity on governance comes in.

""Post elections, institutional investors would like to see a strong government,"" she said. Speaking about the fear of rupee resuming its fall, the banker said the currency will is not going to see rapid depreciation. ""The government had acted very swiftly on the currency front which resulted in a manageable current account deficit.""

11:30 am Market outlook: UR Bhat, MD, Dalton Capital Advisors feels that Nifty may settle between 5900-6200 range for the near-term. This is because not only have the foreign institutional investor (FII) flows been weak in February but even the December quarter results have not been impressive.

According to him the Fed taper too is likely to continue, so the only news that could turn the sentiment for India would be some positive news flow on political front.

Upendra Kumar Sinha, the current chairman of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), has been given an extension for two years by the finance ministry.

This makes Sinha only the second Sebi chief after DR Mehta to be heading the regulatory body over three years.

Sinha took over the Sebi reins in February 2011, succeeding CB Bhave. Before being appointed the boss, he was the Chairman and Managing Director of UTI Mutual Fund.

Credited with an effort, sometimes acting tough, to bring more transparency to stock markets, we take a look back at this career bureaucrat’s tenure as the Sebi chief.

*After taking his office, Sinha introduced rules to improve corporate governance and disclosure standards.

*Under his regime, Sinha unveiled reforms like change in policies for mutual funds (MFs) and foreign institutional investors (FIIs)

* Sebi became tough on new fund launches. The regulator said it would not allow asset managers to launch funds if their existing portfolio includes a fund with same or similar strategy.

At a public event Sinha had said that Sebi does not want “new funds unless they have a separate (different) style of investment”.

*During his tenure, Sebi also came up with new rules aimed at curbing improper selling by distributors.

*In 2009, Sebi had banned fund houses from charging entry load from new investors and had put curbs on the exit load. This hit the asset management industry. However, Sinha allowed MFs to charge additional fees from existing investors.

*In order to attract more foreign investors and fund flow, Sebi unified the investment route by FIIs and qualified foreign investors by unveiling a uniform entry norm.

*Under Sinha, Sebi asked for special powers for investigations and enforcement by the government.

The finance ministry has sought law ministry’s opinion regarding re-promulgation of the Sebi ordinance. The ordinance authorises Sebi chairman to investigate, conduct search and seizure under the Sebi Act and crack down on Ponzi schemes.

*Sinha found himself entangled in controversy. In 2011, Former Sebi board member KM Abraham had alleged that the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, his officer of special duty (OSD) Omita Paul and Sebi chief UK Sinha had pressured Abraham to go easy against some corporate interests, including the Sahara Group, Reliance, and MCX.

However, the finance ministry rejected Abraham’s allegations claiming it to be “defamatory, devoid of any truth and are a complete distortion of facts”.

*Currently Sebi is fighting some high profile legal cases like – Subrata Roy (Sahara case), Reliance Industries (Mukesh Ambani), Financial Technologies (Jignesh Shah)",431,-0.8810130953788757

12:00 pm Outlook: For all its talk of cutting back on the monetary stimulus, the US Federal Reserve may be in no position to end its monthly bond purchases in 2014, feels Richard Duncan of Blackhorse Asset Management Co.

After much deliberation, the Fed decided to trim monthly bond purchases to USD 75 billion from USD 85 billion from this month. The original plan last year was to pull the plug on the bond purchases by the end of this calendar.

Brokerage house Antique has maintained its ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 84. “We expect volume growth to continue given the fact that due to coal constraints in the short term there may be higher regional deficits and with elections round the corner higher demand will lead to firming of interstate power trading,” the Antique note to clients said.

Higher depreciation and increase in tax rates should result in a muted PAT growth of 13 percent. Depreciation is expected to increase 60-70 percent and tax rate may jump by 130 basis points Y-o-Y.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) may grow 16.6 percent on yearly basis to Rs 595 crore and operating profit margin may expand 30 basis points to 17 percent compared to a year ago period.

9:30 am FII view: Prabhat Awasthi of Nomura sees market returns of 17 percent but is cautious of potential post-poll volatility. ""We expect the market's macro ecosystem this year to improve on both the inflation and rates fronts. Meanwhile, a range-bound rupee and slow growth should rein in the current account deficit against the backdrop of a rebounding global economy. However, we expect growth to remain a drag this year, held down by weak investment and muted consumption,"" he says.

Chris Wood of CLSA believes the macro hopes of a sustained acceleration in US growth rest on a pick-up in capex and average hourly earnings growth. In the absence of that evidence the best that can be hoped for is a short-term acceleration driven by the end of 'fiscal drag', he adds.

The 30-share BSE benchmark rallied 375.72 points on Monday, marking the biggest gain since November 25, 2013. The rally was largely driven by new gas pricing policy, rupee appreciation, Infosys earnings and hopes of no hike in policy rates.

Investors will be keenly scrutinising the consumer price index (CPI) and wholesale price index (WPI) numbers for December 2013 to be declared on January 13 and January 15, respectively.

Bloomberg consensus estimate for CPI is 10.09 percent compared to 11.24 percent November reading. Similarly estimate for WPI is 7.00 percent compared to 7.52 percent November reading.

Also read: Five things that keep Goldman Sachs up at night

A lot depends on these numbers as regards to the future stance of Reserve Bank of India. The central bank governor, in the last meeting, had taken a dovish stance as far as interest rate is concerned based on the premise that inflation is expected to cool from the peaks of November readings.

Even as Raguram Rajan had left the field open for RBI intervention midway if the situation calls, the next date to be noted is when the RBI meets on January 28.

Focus will also be on third-quarter earnings that started on January 10, with key results from Infosys and IndusInd Bank. The key results to be declared this week are: Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, HCL Tech and TCS on January 16, and HDFC Bank, ITC, Reliance Industries and Wipro on January 17.

Apart from the results due to which stock-specific action may take place, the markets are expected to be range-bound with a downward bias as politics takes the centre stage in the run-up to the parliamentary elections due in May this year.

Investors are deeply concerned that the election may throw up a highly fragmented parliament leading to unstable ruling combination, which may result in more populism rather than following of a progressive reforms-oriented path by lawmakers.

Globally, it was a somewhat quieter last week following the routine jobs and central bank releases. In US too, the earnings will be on focus with consensus building up that the market is ripe for profit taking, and the earnings season is its first big test of the year. With no major data release from China, Eurozone is largely going to be focused upon the German constitutional hearing that has been shifted back from last week.

Bharat Iyer of JP Morgan: The dependence on global liquidity and quantitative easing tapering linked volatility will likely continue over Q1CY14. The result of the national election in May would play an important role in H2CY (January-June 2014) growth revival, particularly for the investment cycle and also for the performance of Indian equities. Our top picks have a cyclical bias. ICICI Bank and DLF are domestic cyclical expected to benefit from a revival in growth and modest valuations. We also expect global growth to accelerate into the year ahead which should benefit companies like Tata Motors, Tata Steel and HCL Technologies. Cyclical recovery makes us more cautious on expensive defensives, HUL and Colgate.

Neelkanth Mishra of Credit Suisse: We expect the divergence between the investment cycle and middle-income consumption on one hand and low-end consumption on the other to continue. Growth in the informal economy though should continue to drive wage growth for the poor. Indices have already started to reflect this divergence.

Reliance Industries and its partners BP Plc of UK and Canada's Niko Resources may have to provide a maximum of USD 1.2 billion in bank guarantees over three years to get nearly double the rate for natural gas being produced from the main fields in KG-D6 block.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on December 20 decided to allow RIL to almost double the price of natural gas from April, 2014 provided the firm gave a bank guarantee to cover its liability if gas-hoarding charges are proved.The bank guarantee, which will be equivalent to the incremental revenue that RIL will get from the new gas price, will be encashed if it is proved that the company hoarded gas or deliberately suppressed production at the main Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&D3) fields in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block since 2010-11, sources said.Considering gas prices will rise from USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit to USD 8.2-8.4 after the Rangarajan pricing formula comes into effect from next fiscal, the bank guarantee - being the difference of current and new price - for every trillion cubic feet of gas production will come to USD 4 billion.Sources said the bank guarantee for the entire remaining recoverable gas reserves of about 0.75 Tcf in D1&D3 fields comes to USD 3 billion. At current rate of production of about 8 million standard cubic meters per day, D1&D3 will produce about 0.3 Tcf in the next three years - the time that may be needed to settle the issue of gas hoarding charges.The bank guarantee for 0.3 Tcf comes to USD 1.2 billion, they said. Of this, the share of RIL, which holds 60 per cent stake in KG-D6, will come to USD 60 million per quarter. BP has 30 per cent interest and the remaining 10 per cent is with Niko.D1&D3, the first of the 19 discoveries in eastern offshore KG-D6 block that was put on production in April 2009, originally was estimated to hold 10.03 Tcf of reserves. But these were last year slashed to 2.9 Tcf based on production data for first three years when wells were shut one after another following water and sand sweeping inside along with sharp drop in reservoir pressure.Of the re-stated reserves of 2.9 Tcf, about 2.2 Tcf have already been produced in first four-and-half-years and balance of about 0.75 Tcf remains to be produced.Sources said the new rate will apply to all other fields in KG-D6 without any preconditions. The currently producing MA oil and gas as well as fields like R-Series and satellite discoveries that will come into production in 2016-17 will also get the new rates without any preconditions.The government, sources said, has already imposed a penalty of USD 1.78 billion on RIL and its partners for producing less-than-stated production targets during last three years. The bank guarantee is an addition to this.While RIL blames unseen geological complexities for production not matching the pre-stated targets for D1&D3, the Petroleum Ministry and its technical arm DGH hold the company for not drilling the committed number of wells, resulting in output fall.With both sides not budging from their positions, the issue has been referred to arbitration which may take anywhere between 2 to 3 years to arrive at final verdict.Prodded by the Finance ministry, the Oil ministry had initially proposed to deny the new gas prices that will kick in from next fiscal till such time that RIL either made up for the shortfall in output during past three fiscals, or it is proved that the company was not responsible for production falling below targets.The issue had held up notification of the new gas pricing formula that will be applicable to all producers - public and private - and all forms of gas - conventional and unconventional forms like coal-bed methane and shale gas.As a way out, it was proposed that RIL and its partners BP and Niko be asked to give bank guarantees for the incremental revenue they will get till the hoarding issue is resolved through arbitration and validation by independent international experts.The government in June approved the Rangarajan formula for pricing of all domestically produced natural gas at an average of global gas hub rates and price at which India imports LNG (gas in liquid form).The rate in April 2014, when the new pricing is to be implemented, will be about USD 8.2 to 8.4 as against the current USD 4.2.Prices of natural gas, which is an input for manufacturing fertiliser and electricity generation, will be revised every quarter based on the average of the past four quarters, with a gap of one quarter.",780,0.0

Corporate czars like Anil Ambani, Sunil Bharti Mittal and business houses including Tatas came under intense judicial scanner for scam-related cases in 2013 with Subrata Roy Sahara facing the toughest time in Supreme Court which restrained him from leaving India.Be it the witness box in trial courts or corridors of the Delhi High Court and the apex court, names of business tycoons like Mukesh Ambani, Kumar Mangalam Birla, Naveen Jindal and Ravi Ruia cropped up in controversial matters and cases which are under scrutiny in different judicial forums.The year also saw several multinational giants like Finish mobile maker Nokia rushing to the high court in a high stake tax dispute while UK-based Vedanta Group, Korean steel major Posco and Swiss pharma firm Novartis were engaged in Supreme Court on issues ranging from industrial pollution, licences and patent.The patent battle saw domestic pharmaceutical firms getting a major boost with the apex court dismissing the plea of Novartis for patent of a cancer drug Glivec, paving the way for Indian companies to manufacture cheap generic drugs.So was the case in the high court where US-pharma major Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) failed to get any relief against Indian Pharma Glenmark which has come up with generic anti- diabetic medicines. An intra-court appeal against the order is pending before a larger bench.However, the year was tough for Sahara India Parivar as Roy was not only restrained from leaving India but he and his group firms were accused of taking the apex court ""for ride"" and ""playing hide and seek"" in the case relating to refund of Rs 20,000 crore to investors in which they are facing contempt proceedings.More trouble came when the apex court said that contempt proceedings can go ahead against Roy and his two employees for interfering with the investigation into the 2G spectrum case.The 2G spectrum scam also forced Bharti Cellular CMD Sunil Mittal, Essar Group promoter Ravi Ruia and Reliance ADAG chief Anil Ambani to rush to the apex court in the wake of special CBI court issuing them summonses to appear as accused and witnesses respectively.While Mittal and Ruia got a temporary relief from the apex court which stayed the proceedings against them in additional spectrum scam in which they have been summoned as an accused, Ambani failed to convince the court to give an order against the trial court directing him to appear as a witness in the 2G case involving former Telecom Minister A Raja and others, including three top executives of his group.A day after ADAG chief's testimony, his wife Tina Ambani also made her appearance in the Patiala house court and recorded her statement which was described as ""better than her husband"" in answering questions by special judge O P Saini.Government's controversial decision to hike the price of natural gas reached the Supreme Court which agreed to examine the issue raised by CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta who filed a PIL accusing Petroleum Minister M Veerappa Moily of allegedly favouring Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which have been refuted by them.If 2012 was the year of 2G scam, then 2013 would be recorded in the history of the apex court for coalgate case and CBI's clamour to attain autonomy and free itself from its political masters to investigate top bureaucrats.The high voltage hearing in the coal scam saw the apex court taking strong exception to the interference into its probe by the then Law Minister Ashwani Kumar, who was forced to resign.CBI, which was termed as ""caged parrot"" by the apex court during the hearing in the coal scam, came out all guns blazing and named corporate bigwigs Naveen Jindal and Kumar Mangalam Birla in separate FIRs registered in connection with the case.The controversy surrounding former corporate lobbyist Niira Radia's tapped conversations was dealt by the apex court and after long hearing, it directed CBI to probe some key issues in which names of some big corporates, politicians, bureaucrats and journalists cropped up.

Nokia, which, as per the Income Tax department, owes it Rs 21,153 crore as total tax liability (existing and anticipated), including penalty during a seven-year period from 2006-2013, had moved the court with its plea for lifting of stay on sale of the assets.The controversy surrounding the AirAsia deal reached the Delhi High Court after the apex court asked BJP leader Subramanian Swamy to approach the high court.The high court sought responses from Civil Aviation Ministry and DGCA on the plea which has sought a direction against grant of further approvals on the ground that the deal was contrary to the applicable FDI policy and DGCA guidelines.During the year, the functioning of UK-based multinational accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Pvt Ltd and its network audit firms in India came under judicial scrutiny with the apex court agreeing to hear a petition for a probe against them for allegedly indulging in financial irregularities and fudging of accounts.The court issued notice to Centre, RBI, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), PwC and the audit firms sharing its brand name saying the issues raised in the petition need ""examination"".In the issue of arbitration proceedings of dispute between Antrix Corporation, the commercial arm of ISRO, and Devas Multimedia regarding scrapping of 1,000 crore deal for scarce S-band spectrum, the apex court held that it can take place at International Court of Arbitration in London.The court had dismissed Antrix's plea which had contended that according to their agreement and tender conditions, the place of arbitration was Bangalore and sought seeking its direction for conducting arbitration proceeding in India.",939,0.0

Equity benchmarks crawled higher during the week-ended December 28, with the Nifty gaining 0.7 percent to finish at 6,313, and the Sensex closing at 21,193, up 0.5 percent.

Buyers scoured for bargains among secondline shares, pushing up the CNX Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices 2.5 and 3.5 percent, respectively.

Capital goods, realty, power and bank shares were the flavour of the week, while pharma, FMCG and IT had an indifferent run.

Dealers said overall activity was low key because of the vacation season.

Mid- and small-cap stocks have been trading far below their 2008 highs -- the CNX Midcap index is trading close to 8,000, compared to a high of 9,637 logged in January 2008 even as the Nifty trades close to its record highs.

This is an indication that the broader markets could outperform going into 2014, believes broker Dipan Mehta. ""The best returns [in 2014] will be in mid- and small-cap stocks,"" he said. ""As you see uncertainty levels come down, these shares will rally as their as their earnings become more predictable and they attain higher price-to-earnings multiples.""

This, he said, was typical of bull markets where ""in the first phase, large-cap stocks do well and then mid- and small-caps start outperforming large-caps.""

KR Bharat, MD, Advent Advisors, however, was more cautious in his outlook and said given the weak fundamentals of the Indian economy, most of the 2013 rally in equities was driven by liquidity. One could witness a correction lasting the first or even a few quarters of 2014 and then a bull market from thereon, he said.

""Over the next two-three months, the pace of the Federal Reserve tapering will hasten and so liquidity will not play a major role in 2014. If India is to see a bull market, it has to be on the basis of [strong] Indian fundamentals and we are a fair distance from that.""

1:50 pm Interview: The government recently hiked the customs duty on imported natural rubber from Rs 20/kg or 20 percent (whichever being lower) to Rs 30/kg or 30 percent (lower of the two). The move was prompted by a shortfall in domestic rubber production and cheap international rubber prices that led to increased rubber imports by tyre companies.

A Subba Rao, CFO of the company said in an interview to CNBC-TV18, ""It is unfortunate but it is not a significant increase: about Rs 10 per kilo. Rubber prices were anyway expected around Rs 160 levels. Since rubber prices haven’t gone up significantly, it’s not going to impact the industry. It also boils down to demand. The auto industry has not been doing very well, we are seeing mostly replacement demand. So in the tyre-cost structure, natural rubber has about 30 percent cost component. An increase of Rs 10 would translate into about Rs 2-2.5 cost increase so it is not significant.""

Natural gas prices in India may jump to USD 10 within three years of implementation of the Rangarajan formula, generating enough additional revenue to meet higher subsidy outgo on the fertiliser sector.

The government has decided to price all domestically produced gas by both public and private sector firms at an average price of LNG imports into India and benchmark global gas rates from April 1, 2014.

Barclays Equity Research estimates the price will be USD 8.3 per million British thermal unit in 2014-15 as against the current rate of USD 4.2. This will rise to USD 9.1 in the following year and then to USD 9.4 in 2016-17.

""We estimate the gas price could be more than USD 10 per mmBtu by FY16 as per the formula,"" Goldman Sachs said. The new rates, which will change every quarter based on 12-month average of global rates and LNG import price with a lag of one quarter, will apply to all gas produced by both public sector firms like ONGC and private companies like Reliance Industries Ltd.

""Prices will be revised quarterly and, in our view, will change by USD 0.1-0.5 per mmBtu for every USD 10 change in oil prices given the linkage to LNG pricing,"" Barclays said in a research note.

It estimated gas producers to garner USD 4 billion in revenue from higher gas prices from 2014-15 while government will rake in an additional USD 505 million from royalty, profit share, taxes and dividend.

After paying USD 360 million in additional fertiliser subsidy resulting for higher input gas cost, the government will be left with USD 101 million, it said.

ICICI Securities said the decision will ""reignite investments in Indian exploration and production, especially development of offshore gas discoveries on the east coast and gradual alignment of industry demand (across sectors) to a higher gas price environment"".

More than 30 Trillion cubic feet of reserves in the Krishna Godavari basin can be developed at the new rates.

""Economics for marginal gas fields, primarily owned by ONGC (and some by RIL), could also improve,"" it said.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp's (ONGC) 2-3 Tcf reserves, 4.98 Tcf of RIL and 4 Tcf of Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) could be viable at higher gas prices, it said.

The decision, Edelweiss Securities, is ""a significant positive for the sector considering that a lot of deep water resources become viable"".

Of the total domestic gas volume of about 86 million standard cubic meters per day, three key economically sensitive sectors - power, fertiliser and LPG - consume about 67 mmscmd. ""We see additional burden for them of Rs 19,700 crore or 0.16 per cent of GDP,"" Morgan Stanley said.",458,0.6013691067695618

Defending the government decision to double natural gas prices from April next year, Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily today said higher rates will help raise domestic production and cut dependence on imports. While the government had in June approved a new formula for pricing of all domestically produced natural gas, the Cabinet yesterday allowed the same principles to also be applied to Reliance Industries' currently producing fields in KG-D6 block subject to certain conditions.

""If you don't raise gas price, no domestic production will come and dependence on imports will increase,"" Moily said at the AIMA's 3rd PSU Summit here. India, which currently imports half of its gas needs, has the hydrocarbon potential which require lot of money to exploit, he said. ""You need to spend a lot of money on technology (to access the hydrocarbon) and research."" Higher gas price will help bring to production over 3 Trillion cubic feet of gas reserves that had been declared economically unviable at current rates of USD 4.2.

Several gas discoveries of firms like Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) as well as of RIL had been declared unviable by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) as current gas price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit was inadequate to cover the cost. The Minister said the option before the country was to either keep the finds in the ground and continue importing gas at USD 12-13 or pay much lesser than this price to domestic producers to bring the discoveries to production and cut foreign exchange outgo on imports.

""We may end up importing 100 percent (of our needs) if we don't encourage exploration,"" Moily said. The reserves in the discoveries not viable at current price equals the remaining resources in the currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&D3) gas fields in RIL's eastern offshore KG-D6 block. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on June 27 approved pricing of domestically produced gas at an average of imported LNG and international benchmarks from April 1 2014. Accordingly, the price in April would be about USD 8.4.

While the decision was to apply to all public and private producers of conventional gas and non-conventional fuel like coal-bed methane and shale gas, the decision was not notified as the Finance Ministry felt RIL should not get the benefit because it has in past three years produced less than targets. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs yesterday allowed RIL the new rates provided it gave a bank guarantee to cover its liability if gas-hoarding charges are proved. The bank guarantee, which will be equivalent to the incremental revenue that RIL will get from the new gas price, will be encashed if it is proved that the company hoarded gas or deliberately suppressed production at the main Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&D3) fields in KG-D6 block since 2010-11.",481,0.18329856793085733

A day after the call to taper, US markets ended flat to lower on mixed economic data on Thursday. European markets though reacted positively to a less easy Fed, with core markets ending 1.5 percent higher. The Indian market gave up some of previous day’s gains on fears that Fed tapering, which will begin in January, may impact inflow of overseas money. The Sensex slipped 151.24 points to close at 20,708.62, and the Nifty lost 50.50 points to 6,166.65.

Meanwhile, Asian markets opened cautious today morning as China's liquidity fears resurface. Caution before the Bank of Japan's monetary policy decision could also explain the weak sentiment though investors will be watching out for hints of future stimulus.

China's spiking money market rates will dominate trade in Asia after the People's Bank of China took emergency steps yesterday to inject liquidity into selected banks, aiming to soothe a liquidity squeeze as borrowing costs rise to six-month highs.

GAIL India Ltd, the nation's biggest natural gas distributor, has doubled the marketing margin it charges from customers on sale of a small volume of gas sourced from state-owned ONGC. GAIL used to charge Rs 200 per thousand cubic metres (Rs 5 per million British thermal unit) as effort money or marketing margin from consumers like fertiliser plants and power stations, for selling natural gas sourced from fields that Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had got from the government on nomination basis (called APM gas).

However, a distinction has now been made in the gas produced from fields given to ONGC on nomination basis. Any gas that came into production after 2010 is being treated differently than APM gas for which the government decides the price as well as marketing margin.

Gas from the fields of ONGC that came into production after 2010 are being termed as non-APM gas and GAIL has been since November billing higher marketing margin of Rs 10.21 per mmBtu on such fuel sold to consumers, sources said.

Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers Ltd (RCF) and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are among the consumers who have got two bills for November quoting the higher marketing margin.

While RCF refused to pay the higher charges, RIL paid the first bill in protest but when the second bill came it deducted the higher charges it had paid earlier, they said. Non-APM gas coming from the nomination fields of ONGC is distributed to consumers by GAIL although a small volume is directly sold to consumers by ONGC itself.

While ONGC has not changed the marketing margin on the volumes it trades directly to consumers, GAIL has been since November billing consumers a higher marketing margin. GAIL, sources said, has reasoned that the higher marketing margin is at par with the rate it charges for its effort on sale of gas from western offshore fields of Panna/Mukta and Tapti.

At the time of revising APM gas price to USD 4.2 per mmBtu in May 2010 (effective from June 1, 2010), the Oil Ministry had directed that marketing margin of Rs 200 per thousand cubic metres would be charged from customers by the company marketing the gas produced by national oil companies (ONGC and Oil India Ltd).

The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) today suggested that market regulator Sebi could look at considering the consent application of Reliance Industries to settle the 6-year-old insider-trading case against the firm, and adjourned the hearing to October 29.

SAT has been hearing the appeal filed by RIL against Sebi in the insider-trading case related to its erstwhile subsidiary Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) dating back to 2007.The company is also contesting the regulator's decision of last May to keep the case out of the consent mechanism, suggesting the amount involved is too high.Under Sebi's consent mechanism, companies can seek to settle cases with the regulator after paying certain charges and disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains.Hearing the arguments, which have been adjourned eight times in recent past alone, SAT presiding officer J P Devadhar said: ""Without going into the merits of the case, we want to know if Sebi can consider RIL's consent application in the interest of justice.""In response to this, Sebi senior counsel Darius Khambata said he will inform the tribunal after discussing the suggestion with the regulator.Following this, SAT adjourned the further hearing on the petition to October 29.The case dates back to 2007, when before the merger of the RPL with itself, RIL sold 4.1 per cent stake in Reliance Petroleum for Rs 4,023 crore in the futures market to allegedly prevent a price correction and later in the spot market, covering the share sales in the futures market.As per the Sebi findings, the company booked a profit of Rs 513 crore in the futures segment through this deal. RPL was later merged with RIL.Sebi claimed that the company was aware of the sale of shares and sold futures ahead of that, therefore amounting to insider trading.Following this Sebi ordered a probe and found that RIL had violated insider-trading norms. Though it approached Sebi for consent settlement, the regulator did not entertain the application, forcing RIL to move SAT.At the last hearing on September 25, SAT had asked Sebi to produce the file on the alleged RIL insider trading case and the notings of the committee that decided to withdraw the company from the consent mechanism.Under the consent mechanism companies/individuals can seek to settle cases with paying a fine but without admitting to or denying any wrongdoing. In case the allegations are proved, then a company may end up paying up to three times the profit made from the illegal trade practices.Accordingly, in the case of RIL, the company could pay over Rs 1,500 crore, as it has been alleged that it booked Rs 513 crore from insider trading.RIL has challenged the show-cause notice issued by Sebi in December 2010 citing that it was not given adequate access to the documents on which the show-cause was based. RIL has also challenged Sebi for taking the case out of the consent process and also for changing the norms governing this mechanism, especially when the case was already under its consideration.In May 2012, Sebi had tightened the consent mechanism framework. As a result, many cases, including those related to insider trading, are not being settled through this mechanism.On January 3 this year, Sebi published a list of 149 consent pleas, including 16 from entities related to the RIL Group, which it had not found suitable for consent settlement.These include applications of RIL itself and that of RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani's close aide Manoj Modi. At the last hearing, SAT had rejected an intervention petition filed in the case by a little-known Urdu daily editor M Furquan who claimed that there could be possible collusion between Sebi and RIL to settle the matter.The matter was last heard by SAT on February 21, when the tribunal sought time to study the application, which Sebi termed as ""not maintainable"". Since then RIL has been seeking adjournments. The case has been adjourned every month since March.",651,0.0

Reliance Industries is evaluating investing multi-billion dollars in 2-3 oil blocks offered by Venezuela as it looks at countries from Myanmar to Canada to expand its overseas energy assets.

""We are looking at two things in Venezuela. One is, we have a long term (crude oil) supply contract and we are looking at enhancing the quantities under this contract, possibly from next year,"" RIL Executive Director P M S Prasad told reporters on sidelines of a FICCI event.

RIL currently imports about 300,000 barrels per day of oil from Venezuela for processing at its twin refineries at Jamangar in Gujarat. It now wants to increase these volumes, possibly to 400,000 bpd.

""The second is, we are also looking at investing in Venezuela... They have given us 2-3 opportunities for us to evaluate and make a decision. So, in the next few months complete our evaluation and make a decision,"" he said.

Venezuela has offered 2-3 oil blocks. Years after it dropped out of a ONGC-led consortium for developing Venezuela's giant oil fields, RIL is now keen on taking a project to produce heavy oil in the South American nation. It last year signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, to develop a project in the Orinoco extra heavy crude belt.

Though Prasad did not elaborate on the ""opportunities"" offered by Venezuela, RIL may be looking at the Boyaca 4 block and a separate section in the Ayacucho area of the Orinoco belt. Both these areas can produce 2,00,000 bpd (10 million tonnes a year) each.

He, however, said the project may involve developing the field and setting up an upgrader to convert the synthetic oil into oil that can be processed in refineries.

Last year, RIL had also signed a new agreement to buy more crude oil from Venezuela. It had in 2008 signed a deal to buy 150,000 bpd of oil, which was gradually raised to 270,000 bpd. Under the new 15-year agreement, the South American country would sell between 300,000 and 400,000 bpd.

RIL operates twin refineries at Jamnagar with a total refining capacity of 1.24 million barrels a day. Half of its crude diet can be heavy oil. Prasad said RIL was looking at opportunities to invest in Mexico, Iraq, Canada and Myanmar.

RIL was in 2009 supposed to bid with the Indian consortium of ONGC Videsh Ltd, Indian Oil Corp and Oil India Ltd for one of the three giant oil blocks Venezuela was offering through auction. It, however, walked out of the consortium possibly due to delays in bidding.

After RIL's exit, OVL-IOC-OIL teamed up with Repsol YPF SA, Spain's biggest oil company, and Malaysia's Petronas to make a successful bid for the massive Carabobo-1 project in Venezuela's Orinoco heavy oil belt. The field, which had about 50 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, can produce a minimum of 400,000 bpd of oil.",492,0.3537906010945638

Reliance Industries has countered Power Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia's assertion that power plants were lying idle due to fall in KG-D6 gas supplies, saying most of these plants were built much before the field was even discovered.

RIL Executive Director P M S Prasad on August 24 wrote to Scindia saying none of the 31 power plants that he had stated as being dependent on gas supplies from RIL, were ""installed or financed on the basis of supply of KG-D6 gas"".

Also read: Reliance Cap to invest Rs 100 cr in wind power proj: Ambani



""All records available (based on publicly available information) reveal that almost all of these plants came up and were financed by lending institutions, based on specific alternative allocations/supply sources much before the KG-D6 block had even acquired a development plan,"" he wrote.



These plants, he said, were built on promise of gas from ONGC, Cairn, GSPC-Niko or BG-operated PMT fields.



""In most cases, the stipulated gas supplies not materialising or other fuels being found to be too expensive, allocations of KG-D6 gas were made by way of substitution in 2008,"" Prasad wrote attaching list of power plants, their date of commissioning and the stated source of fuel.



Scindia had on August 22 told Lok Sabha that 31 power plants of 14,028 MW capacity were dependent on KG-D6 gas. Of these, 12 plants with generation capacity of 2,978.62 MW were solely dependent on gas supplies from RIL'S KG-D6 fields and are lying idle.



With water and sand ingress shutting down half of wells on KG-D6 fields, gas production has dropped dramatically and power plants, which are third in priority list for receipt of gas, are not being supplied any fuel since March.



Prasad said of the 31 power plants mentioned by Scindia, 20 with combined capacity of 9,100 MW had been commissioned even before RIL gas discovery in KG-D6 block in 2002. Another 300 MW got commissioned in 2003.



Further out of the remaining 4,600 MW, 3,800 MW was installed or was under construction before 2005. ""All these plants had allocations as well as specific fuel supply agreements on the basis of APM gas, gas from domestic sources other than KG-D6 or LNG,"" he said.



RIL had barely begun to invest in developing the D1&D3 gas fields in KG-D6 block in 2005 and so out of 14,028 MW mentioned by Scindia to be dependent on KG-D6 gas, 13,200 MW were either already installed or under construction before that, he said.



Prasad said the statement that 3000 MW of projects that were dependent completely on KG-D6 gas and lying idle due to fall in KG-D6 output was factually incorrect.



Of these, 2,150 MW was in existence before 2002 and another 1,200 MW was constructed based on imported LNG as fuel, he said.",474,-0.9927380681037903

Reliance Industries has agreed to provide access to all records and cooperate unconditionally with the CAG for audit on its spending in the flagging KG-D6 gas fields, the Oil Ministry said today.



Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Panabaka Lakshmi, in a written statement to the Rajya Sabha, corrected a reply she had given on August 6 wherein she had stated that the Comptroller & Auditor General of India (CAG) was doing a ""performance"" audit of KG-D6 block.



A statement that Lakshmi laid on the table of the Rajya Sabha said it was to correct ""the error by deleting the word performance"" audit in the reply given on August 8.



""The Ministry has taken seriously the issue raised by CAG in audit of KG-D6 block. Initially, there were certain issues being raised by the operator, RIL, relating to scope and coverage of audit to be conducted by the CAG. Due to this, there was a delay in taking up the audit.



""However, these issues have since been resolve with continuous engagement of government with audit as well as the operator. Consequently, RIL has agreed to provide access to all records and cooperate unconditionally with regard to audit of the block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6). Audit by the CAG is currently under progress,"" she said.

CAG Principal Director of Audit (Economic and Service Ministries) A M Bajaj had last month written a letter to the ministry stating that RIL was providing information sought in phases and some records sought were still pending.



CAG, at the request of the Oil Ministry, is auditing KG-D6 spending for 2008-09 to 2011-12. It restarted the audit in April after issues like scope and extent of its scrutiny

were resolved.

RIL had previously stated that CAG cannot contractually perform a performance audit on it and Production Sharing Contract (PSC) only provides for a government appointed auditor to verify reasonableness of all charges and credits.



CAG too has stated that it is not planning to do a performance audit of the company but only wants to examine ""propriety"" of expenses made. For doing that CAG has been given the discretion of requisitioning records as it deems fit.



In the August 6 reply, Lakshmi had stated that ""RIL has agreed to provide access to all records and cooperate unconditionally with regard to performance audit of the block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6).""",401,-0.9088109731674194

Oil regulator DGH has recommended an additional penalty of USD 781 million on Reliance Industries, taking the total fine on the company for producing less than projected natural gas from KG-D6 fields to USD 1.786 billion.

Also read:

Natural gas trades sideways on forecasts for warmer temps in U.S. plains

The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) last month recommended to the Oil Ministry that USD 781 million of the cost RIL has incurred in KG-D6 fields be disallowed for producing only an average of 26.07 million cubic meters per day of gas as against the target of 86.73 mmcmd in 2012-13.

This will be in addition to USD 1.005 billion in cost recovery already disallowed for output falling short of targets during 2010-11 and 2011-12, a top official said.



""DGH had in July 22 letter proposed for disallowance of cumulative cost recovery amounting to USD 1.786 billion (USD 1.005 billion for plus USD 781 million) up to FY 2012-13 towards creation of excess capacity,"" he said.



It blamed RIL for not drilling its committed quota of wells leading to fall in production, resulting in a large chunk of production facilities lying unused or under-utilised.

RIL has built infrastructure to handle 80 mmscmd of output but is currently producing less than 14 mmscmd.

As per the production sharing contract, RIL and its partners BP Plc and Niko Resources are allowed to deduct all of the capital and operating expenses from sale of gas before sharing profits with the government. Creation of excess or unutilised infrastructure impacts government's profit share and this is being sought to be corrected by disallowing part of the cost.



DGH, the official said, stated that after cost disallowance, RIL would be required to pay USD 114 million in additional profit petroleum to the government for 2012-13 in addition to USD 103 million that was already due.



The Oil Ministry is yet to act on the advice of DGH as the previous cost recovery disallowance notice is under arbitration.



While DGH made a case against RIL for not meeting the gas output projects, the regulator in a separate communication to the ministry took a diagonally opposite view on the issue of capping gas prices and the company being asked to deliver gas shortfall at old prices.



It said companies cannot be held against the projected output in a field development plan due to the dynamic nature of the exploration and production.



DGH Head of PSC Anurag Gupta on August 1 wrote that projected production in most blocks would not be identical with actual output ""because of the dynamic nature of exploration and production activities which need to be adapted to suit the ground realities and operational requirements.""",459,-0.9629997213681539

Over USD 21 billion powers plants being stranded for want of fuel notwithstanding, an Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) may not give any significant natural gas to the fuel-starved units till domestic production rises in 2016-17.

The EGoM headed by Defence Minister A K Antony is to meet shortly to squeeze out some gas from current year output of 105 million standard cubic meters a day for the power plants.

Official sources said things have been complicated by fall in Reliance Industries' eastern offshore KG-D6 field to just 14 mmscmd at present. It is projected to 11 mmscmd this fiscal before rising to 19 mmscmd in the first quarter of 2015 and remain at that level till 2016-17.

The fall in KG-D6 from 62 mmscmd achieved in March 2010 means 25 power plants that signed up for 29.74 mmscmd of KG-D6 get no gas.

Sources said on instructions of EGoM the Oil Ministry carried out a detailed exercise to assess additional gas available and the demand.

About 4-5 mmscmd additional gas will be available from fields of ONGC and GSPC in 2013-14. A similar additional volume may be available in the next fiscal and a further 2 mmscmd from GSPC in 2015-16.

This additional production will have to make up for fall in KG-D6 this fiscal and the next as also meet 3.8 mmscmd need of 5 newly converted fertiliser plants for whom allocation had previously been approved by the Cabinet and EGoM.

Also, 2.95 mmscmd has to be given to LPG extraction plants of GAIL and ONGC, they said, adding LPG has been given second priority after urea manufacturing units.

Moreover, there will be an additional demand of 2.17 mmscmd of gas for petrochemical plant of ONGC at Dahej. The EGoM had at the time of deciding priority of gas allocation, had taken a call that all molecules from the gas should be extracted before it is burnt as fuel. ONGC's C2/C3 plant will fits into that priority.

Sources said out of additional availability of 4-5 mmscmd in 2014-15, availability for power sector would be 2-3 mmscmd. Most of this will flow to the Dabhol power plant that had been given equal priority as fertiliser plants after its revival at a cost of Rs 13,000 crore. No KG-D6 gas flows to the plant now despite it being allocated 7 mmscmd of KG-D6 gas.

Additional availability of about 10 mmscmd during 2015-16 could be provided for the power sector, they said adding further availability of 29 mmscmd from ONGC during 2016-17 and 11 mmscmd from RIL's R-Series fields in KG-D6 block in 2017-18 would be sufficient for power and fertiliser sectors.

For the present, the power sector may be asked to consider buying more imported LNG to produce electricity.

At present, only a third of the 72 mmscmd of gas needs of the 18,713 MW gas-based power plants is being met. Another 8,000 MW capacity is almost ready for commissioning but there is no gas availability to fire the plants.

At its last meeting, EGOM rejected the proposal to snap natural gas supplies to urea plants and divert that fuel to power companies.",533,

ADA Group Chairman's testimony is needed to explain why Reliance invested over Rs 900 crore in Swan Telecom Pvt Ltd, facing trial in the case along with its promoters Shahid Usman Balwa and Vinod Goenka. The court had also allowed 11 others to be examined in the case.

Anil Ambani had told the CBI that questions on shell firms allegedly related to his company can be ""best answered"" by his colleagues as he has ""full faith"" on them. He had also claimed before the CBI that Tatas had ""funded"" Unitech's applications and fee for grant of 2G spectrum licences during the tenure of former Telecom Minister A Raja.

In a statement given to CBI on February 16, 2011, Ambani had said he ""does not"" admit that Swan Telecom Pvt Ltd, facing trial in the case along with its promoters, was a Reliance ADA Group company and that he has lost his ""prestige"" in the entire saga. Ambani's statement was placed before the court on Monday.

The CBI, in its chargesheet, had alleged that Reliance ADAG's firm Reliance Telecom Ltd (RTL) had used Swan Telecom, an ineligible firm, as its front company to get licenses and the costly radio waves. Three top executives of Reliance ADAG are facing trial in the case along with others, including Unitech Ltd MD Sanjay Chandra and Unitech Wireless (Tamil Nadu) Ltd.

Market capital of Reliance Communications has come down drastically. It was vision of my father to make telecom for public,"" Ambani has said in his statement.

On being asked about the alleged shell companies and funds which purportedly came through the firms promoted by RADAG, he said, ""All the paper work is done by my colleagues and these questions can be best answered by my colleagues."" ""There are millions of transactions and I cannot recollect each and every one of them. I do not admit that Swan Telecom was a Reliance ADA Group company,"" he said.

Reliance ADAG chairman Anil Ambani may have to appear on Friday before a special CBI court as a prosecution witness in 2G case as the Supreme Court on Thursday refused to give an urgent hearing on Reliance Telecom Ltd's (RTL) plea against the trial court order and posted the case for hearing on Monday.

A bench headed by Justice GS Singhvi said the matter would be listed on Monday when senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for RTL, pleaded for an early hearing in view of the fact that Ambani has been summoned to appear on Friday before the special CBI court.

Earlier, the apex court had said the case will be heard by a special bench, comprising justices Singhvi and KS Radhakrishnan, which is hearing all the matters pertaining to 2G scam but no date was fixed for the hearing.

Contesting the July 19 order of the special CBI court summoning Anil Ambani and his wife Tina Ambani to depose as CBI witnesses, RTL questioned the decision to call new witnesses at such a late stage of trial.

RTL, one of the three companies accused in the case, has challenged the order of special CBI judge OP Saini, who made the ADAG chairman and his wife prosecution witnesses on CBI's plea that their testimony would throw light on ADAG's companies alleged investment of over Rs. 990 crore relating to 2G spectrum in Swan Telecom.

RTL has moved the Supreme Court against the trial court's order as the apex court bench headed by Justice Singhvi had earlier restrained all other courts, including high court, from entertaining any plea arising out of the 2G case.

The trial court had allowed CBI's plea that the testimony of Anil and Tina Ambani may throw light on alleged investment of over Rs. 990 crore by his group companies in Swan Telecom, facing trial in the case along with its promoters Shahid Usman Balwa and Vinod Goenka.

It had said CBI's plea to summon Anil Ambani, Tina and 11 others as prosecution witnesses was essential for arriving at a just decision in the case.

Testimony of Anil and Tina is required to prove the facts ""pertaining to incorporation of shell companies as some of the witnesses examined earlier have not been able to do so,"" the trial court had said.

The court had dismissed the contentions of the counsel for the accused persons that CBI's plea ""suffers from the vice of delay"", saying the process of examination of prosecution witnesses is still underway.

RADAG's company RTL is an accused in the case. Three top Reliance ADAG executives Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair are also facing trial in the case.

The agency had alleged RTL used Swan Telecom, an ineligible firm, as its front company to get 2G licenses and radio waves.",477,

Reliance Gas Pipeline Ltd (RGPL), a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, has won a licence to lay a 312-km pipeline to transport coal gas produced from RIL's Sohagpur block in Madhya Pradesh. Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) on July 11 authorised the Mukesh Ambani-led RGPL to lay the pipeline from Shahdol in Madhya Pradesh to Phulpur near Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh.

The pipeline will have a capacity to transport 4.3 million standard cubic metres per day of gas including 0.875 mmscmd capacity which will be available for any third party for open access on non-discriminatory basis. PNGRB in the authorisation order said the pipeline will travel from Shahdol to JaysingNagar to Beohari to Gurh and finally culminate at Phulpur.

At Phulpur, the pipeline may be hooked into state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd's main Hazira-Vijaypur-Jagdishpur trunk gas pipeline. Connection with HVJ would enable gas to flow to any consumer. RIL plans to produce 3.5 mmscmd of gas from its Sohagpur (east) and Sohagpur (west) coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks in Shahdol, Madhya Pradesh from 2015.

""The entity is allowed a maximum period of 36 months from the date of issue of authorisation letter for commissioning of the natural gas pipeline project,"" PNGRB said in the July 11 authorisation letter.""Any failure on the part of the entity in complying with the targets prescribed in the time schedule shall lead to consequences"" including cancellation of the authorisation, it said.

RGPL has furnished a performance bond of Rs 13.02 crore as a guarantee for timely commissioning of the project. This is the first authorisation since Ambani's privately owned Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd (RGTIL) lost its permits for laying four natural gas pipelines, over inordinate delays in construction of the 2,175-km lines.

Sebi had passed the order on May 2, 2013, in the case of alleged insider trading in shares of Indian Petrochemicals Corp (IPCL), an erstwhile subsidiary of Reliance Industries. Holding Reliance Petroinvestments guilty of violating the insider trading regulations with regard to its dealings in shares of IPCL in early 2007, Sebi had said RPIL made profit of over Rs 3.82 crore through these trades.

SEBI fines RIL entity Rs 11 cr in IPCL insider trading case

It imposed a penalty of Rs 11 crore on RPIL, which was listed as one of the promoter entities by IPCL itself in regulatory filings as of March 31, 2006.

Sebi had asked RPIL to pay the penalty within 45 days. IPCL, which RIL bought from the government through divestment, used to be a separate entity, but was later merged with RIL and delisted from stock exchanges.

The Sebi order said its investigations showed that RPIL had control over IPCL as ""promoter having control over it with a shareholding of around 46 percent"".

Sebi investigated the trading in IPCL shares from February 22, 2007 to March 08, 2007 and found that RPIL had indulged in insider trading. Sebi, earlier this year, had dropped insider trading charges in IPCL shares against Manoj Modi and his wife. Modi is a close confidante of RIL chief Mukesh Ambani and has held some senior positions at group entities in the past.

Sebi said the charges of insider trading violations could not be proved against Modi. Sebi's probe showed an irregular trading pattern in IPCL shares during the period under review, when two key announcements were made by the company – one about an interim dividend payment and another regarding the amalgamation of IPCL with RIL.",324,-0.8894660770893097

The Supreme Court on Tuesday will continue to hear the PIL on Reliance Industries Limited chairman and CEO Mukesh Ambani's 'Z' category security status. In the previous hearing, the apex court had sought an explanation from the Centre on why 'Z' category security was being provided to Ambani, who is a private businessman, when the common had none.

""Individuals are given security, but what about the security of the common man,"" the apex court had asked. ""The 5-year-old child would not have been raped if there was proper security in the capital,"" it had added.

The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) had deployed an elite squad of its commandos for securing Ambani who has been accorded a 'Z' category security after the Home Ministry analysed security threats to the industrialist and found them to be 'positive'.",146,0.999988317489624

Billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani has turned a venture capitalist and is backing a new television channel Epic TV due to go on air next month. Epic TV is a niche high-definition channel, which will have content based on the nation's history, folklore and mythology in a contemporary format. Set up last October, Epic Television Network is being led by Mahesh Samat, former managing director of Walt Disney Company, who had left the US major last year after a four-year stint.

While refusing to offer details, a

spokesperson confirmed the development and said the investment by Ambani is ""in his personal capacity."" According to reports, Ambani holds over 25 per cent stake along with Mahindra group chairman Anand Mahindra (who also holds over 25 per cent stake in the venture).

And the investment is routed through Reliance Ports & Terminals, which is one of Ambani's personal firms. Samat had earlier said Epic TV was being funded by a group of angel investors but declined to name the investors or the amount. The Epic TV will be Ambani's second broadcasting venture as he already owns a considerable stake in the Network18 Group. In January 2012, a shell company floated by Mukesh Ambani had agreed to invest close to Rs 2,000 crore in Raghav Bahl-promoted debt-ridden media companies Network 18 and TV18 Broadcast, which runs channels like CNBC TV18, CNN-IBN, and Colors among others.

The Network18 deal came after RIL decided to exit a large part of its investment in ETV channels, which was to be acquired by TV18 Broadcast for Rs 2,100 crore. In 2008, RIL had invested Rs 2,600 crore in Ushodaya Enterprises, the holding company of the ETV channels through JM Financials.

The new channel aims to tap into the now digitised cable TV ecosystem and the DTH platform to take advantage of the growing opportunities. It will have about 4-5 hrs of fresh programming every day, which will include 2-3 hrs of long programming and 1-2 hrs of narrative non-fiction shows.

Set up in 1997, Reliance Ports & Terminals, which is engaged in storage, handling and evacuation of crude oil and petroleum products, had in 2008 merged nine group companies with itself to consolidate the Reliance Group's logistics, engineering and construction-related services businesses. Of the merged firms, four provide logistics, pipeline and engineering-related services to the parent company Reliance, while the others are investment-holding companies. The Jamnagar-based company also handles petroleum product evacuation for the group's Jamnagar refinery.",429,0.0362812876701355

R Jagannathan

Firstpost.com

The UPA has passed off mind-boggling foolishness as ""reform"" and the stock markets have had their weekly shot of adrenalin, with the Sensex soaring 520 points yesterday.The celebrations will be short-lived, for the government’s decision to double natural gas prices from USD 4.2 per mmBtu to USD 8.4 per mmBtu from April 2014 is neither reform, nor sensible politics, nor good economics.Here's why.First, there was no tearing hurry to announce a decision for 2014 right now, when a government may change, and the entire global energy scenario may be different. Not only has the UPA tied down the next government to a seriously flawed decision, but its motives in doing so are also suspect.Second, there is no reason why pricing should be announced in dollars – when the rupee is 60 to the dollar. Remember the criticism of the Enron deal? Why price power in dollars when the revenues are all in rupee? The same logic should apply to the Indian gas pricing scene. Why should the Indian consumer, and possibly the taxpayer, take on the exchange risk of India-produced gas?Third, this is simply not reform. How can a committee- or bureaucrat-decided price be called reform? Do bureaucrats know better than the market? If the logic for allowing a price increase is that import prices are higher currently, one wonders what would happen if global prices crash? The only move that can be called reform is market-based pricing – where businesses take both the risks and rewards of global and domestic price movements.Fourth, the move is clearly anti-reform, if one goes by Finance Minister P Chidambaram's statement yesterday. He said that the government had fixed output prices and not input prices – meaning it has decided how much money gas producers, ONGC and Reliance among them, will make, but not how much gas users (power, fertiliser consumers) should pay. This is utter stupidity.Chidambaram said: ""At the moment we are fixing only output prices, the price payable to gas producers. This will indeed have an impact on the consumer, but those prices are not being fixed today…..What is the price at which it should be supplied to a power plant, to a fertiliser plant, in order to make power affordable, fertiliser affordable… that can still be decided between now and April 1 (2014).""This begs the question: if input prices for power and fertiliser can be decided later, why rush to decide output prices nearly a year in advance? When the two are inter-linked, it's like trying to have your cake today, and leaving the job of cleaning up the mess to someone else in 2014.Fifth, any fixing of input at a lower price than output price will mean a bloating of subsidies. Who will pay this? The taxpayer, or somebody else? In the case of oil subsidies, both taxpayers and public sector oil companies have carried the can for the government's political decisions. Will the same happen with gas now? Will ONGC and GAIL bear the subsidies? This would be a disaster, and a clear case of misgovernance. ONGC shareholders should be suing the government if that happens.Sixth, the UPA's intentions appear suspect and mala fide. If the benefits of a gas price hike are to be had upfront (which is what the markets are celebrating) and the costs will be shifted to the next government (which will have to take the painful decision of bearing more subsidies, or reducing the gas price at the output end), this is clearly a scorched-earth policy. The UPA has essentially lobbed a ticking time-bomb to the next government.Seventh, and this could be the government's real motive, it appears that the gas price announcement was intended to achieve two non-reform goals of the UPA: given the drastic fall in the rupee, the government needed the market to perk up in order to reverse capital outflows; it also needs a buoyant stock market to meet its fiscal deficit target. These targets can be met only if public sector shares can be sold to investors. In June, foreign institutional investors sold equity and debt to the tune of over Rs 40,000 crore. The gas price announcement temporarily reversed that trend yesterday. But reform cannot be about meeting these kinds of goals. Or pandering to FIIs.Eighth, even if gas pricing is intended to induce new investments in petrocarbon exploration, it cannot be done in isolation. The energy sector comprises oil, gas, coal, coal-bed methane and shale gas, too. If you want to reform the sector, you have to reform pricing in all of them, not just gas. By raising gas prices, and leaving other prices and sectors as they are, the government is clearly worsening its energy sector problems. The only way to reform is to let prices of fuels find their own levels, so that businesses can make a rational decision on which fuel to use for what kind of output.Ninth, the doubling of gas prices is widely seen as a favour to gas producers. It may well be that, but in the long-term, it will actually damage the gas sector. When you double prices by fiat, the chances are that gas users will go into losses; they will have to be rescued either by the taxpayer or banks. And future demand for gas-based fertiliser and power plants will be curbed. Who will the gas producers sell to then?In the US, when the government decided to boost shale gas production, it did not set any price. The market did that. This brought in new investment, and competition – and today natural gas prices at the US's Henry Hub are below USD 4 per mmBtu. And here we are, trying to double that price and calling it reform.The goal of any policy should be efficiency and competition, not guaranteed profits or losses to any stakeholder. As TN Ninan askes in his weekly column in Business Standard : ""Is any more proof needed that India's reforms, so-called, are business-friendly rather than market-friendly?""It is difficult to believe that the UPA's gas price move was at all intended to reform anything beyond putting out the fire in the economy's backyard – where the rupee was clearly going down in flames.Real reform is what the US did with shale gas. Sorry, Mr Chidambaram, we can't buy this.The writer is editor-in-chief, digital and publishing, Network18 Group(Disclosure: Firstpost and Moneycontrol is published by Network18, whose promoters have received funding from the Reliance Group)",1082,0.0

After rallying anything between 5-9 percent in early morning trade on gas price hike, upstream companies like ONGC Reliance Industries and Oil India failed to sustain momentum at days close.While ONGC closed the day at Rs 330.10, up 2.88 percent, RIL was up 3.78 percent to Rs 861.85. However, Oil India went into negative territory and closed at Rs 570.20, down marginally.The Cabinet Committee for Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Thursday night approved the Rangarajan panel's proposal to hike the natural gas price to USD 8.4 per mmbtu (metric million British thermal units) from April 1, 2014.The committee has further noted that Rangarajan panel's formula for gas pricing would be valid for five years and gas prices will be revised quarterly. The oil ministry in its final proposal had suggested to increase gas price to above USD 6.7 per mmBtu level from current USD 4.2 currently.The natural gas prices have not been increased since past three years as the oil ministry faced stiff resistance from power and fertiliser ministry. Following gas price hike fuel cost of gas based power plant is likely to double and average power cost is seen rising by 16 paise per kwh.The Rangarajan formula uses long-term and spot liquid gas (LNG) import contracts as well as international trading benchmarks to arrive at a competitive price for India. While the Rangarajan panel had recommended revising domestic gas prices every month based, the Oil Ministry changed it to a quarterly revision.Though the average of the two currently comes to USD 6.775, the price of gas in April next year when these guidelines will come into effect would be around USD 8.42 and over USD 10 in the following year. This is because Petronet's deal with Qatar's RasGas (India's only functional long-term LNG contract) has a price-cap which lifts in January 2014, linking gas prices fully with crude.",320,

Representatives of both foreign and domestic retail companies, including Walmart, Tesco, Carrefour, Bharti , Aditya Birla Group, Tatas, Reliance and Pantaloon, among others met Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma here.

The government on its part said ""an early and appropriate view will be taken so that the guidelines can accordingly be

given out"".

""The industry raised two-three major points like the 30 per cent sourcing issue. We have said that it should be 'preferable' and not 'mandatory'. Industry cannot buy everything from SMEs,"" Bharti Enterprises Vice-Chairman and Managing Director Rajan Bharti Mittal told reporters after emerging from the meeting.

As per current FDI policy in the retail sector, 30 per cent of products sold by single brand retailers, where 100 per FDI is allowed, are to be ""preferably"" sourced from small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

Also read: India to lift FDI cap in few sectors by July third week: FM

On the other hand, in multi-brand segment, where only 51 per cent FDI is allowed, it is ""mandatory"" for the company to procure 30 per cent from SMEs.

Commenting on the definition of SMEs, Mittal said: ""We have said that at the entry point it should be an SME but if it crosses the limit of USD 1 million (of investments), we should be allowed to continue sourcing from the same unit.""

On the contentious issue of investment in the back-end infrastructure, he said: ""We should be allowed only 50 percent of the first tranche of investment on back-end infrastructure and future investment should not be restricted.""

As per existing rules, foreign retailers in multi-brand segment will have to make a minimum investment of 100 million in India, of which 50 per cent must be in the back end chain.

A recent clarification by the DIPP has stated that the investment in the back-end infrastructure will have to be specifically for the new chain of stores that the foreign retailer would set up in India.

When asked about the demands of the retailers, Sharma said: ""It was important for the government to hear where are the areas or the issues which may require some more clarity...we have sufficient space to address those concerns, bring in the clarity and an early and appropriate view will be taken so that the guidelines can accordingly be given out."" Official sources, however, said even if the demands of the retailers were met, the matter will have to be taken to the Cabinet for approval.",454,

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Reliance Industries (RIL) will reap windfall profits from the rupee dipping to an all-time low as they will earn more on selling natural gas in US dollars.

ONGC and RIL bill their consumers like fertilizer plants and power stations in dollars. So every time the rupee dips against the dollar, their earnings go up.At current production of less than 15 million standard cubic meters per day, RIL would get over Rs 43 lakh per day more from rupee decline compared to when the rupee is at around 50.For ONGC, it would mean over Rs 1.42 crore a day gain on about 50 mmscmd of gas output. Sources said the windfall to ONGC is courtesy the Oil Ministry, which changed the pricing of domestically produced natural gas from the rupee to the US dollar in 2010.In May 2010, the ministry had decided that gas produced by ONGC and Oil India should be priced in US dollars when rates were revised to $3.818 per million British thermal units ($4.2 per mmBtu after including royalty) from Rs 3,200 per thousand cubic metres (equivalent to $1.79).From 50 mmscmd, ONGC will gain about Rs 522 crore on an annualised basis at the higher exchange rate.Sources said the windfalls that ONGC and RIL are getting are actually being borne by consumers who have to shell out more in electricity rates and fertiliser costs.This situation as well as a scenario where the rupee hardening hurts ONGC's revenue, could have been avoided if domestic gas was priced at the equivalent of $3.818 per mmBtu in rupees, as had been the past practice.RIL stands to gain Rs 156 crore on production of 15 mmscmd of gas from its eastern offshore KG-D6 fields in a year.While KG-D6 gas could not have been priced in rupees, as the contract for the field explicitly provides for pricing of the fuel in US dollars, the additional burden on power and fertiliser firms could have been avoided if the proposal from RIL of having a fixed rupee-dollar ratio had been accepted.RIL, sources said, had in 2007 proposed that the exchange rate could be fixed at Rs. 45 to a US dollar while deciding on KG-D6 price. The rupee was trading at around 43 to a dollar at that time and so it was rejected.It was stated that prevailing exchange rates would be used for the purpose of conversion of the $4.2 per mmBtu price fixed for KG-D6 gas into rupees.Incidentally, by the time RIL began gas production in April 2009, the rupee had weakened to Rs 45 per dollar.Sources said besides the gas price, the $0.11 per mmBtu marketing margin charged by state-owned GAIL India for the effort it makes in selling gas produced by ONGC, too, is US dollar-linked.",474,0.0

Positive takeaways from Reliance Industries' 39th annual general meeting have failed to lift company stock. Despite the firm drawing up Rs 1.5 lakh crore capex for three years, the stock has moved only 0.39 percent to Rs 793.50 in morning tradeAnalysts say, despite chairman Mukesh Ambani highlighting aggressive expansion plans, there is very little clarity on how much will be spent in each segment. There is also no update on probable projects which the company will take up, apart from upping KG-D6 output and aggressive expansion in telecom, which is not so new a development.Also, revision in capex from Rs 1 lakh crore announced last year was on expected lines and nevertheless little clarity on fund raising programme is critical.Reliance, India's fourth-largest company by market value, has been under pressure on worries ranging from slowing natural gas business and its entry into consumer sectors such as telecom and retail.In the year-to-date period, the stock has declined over 5 percent against a 0.37 percent rise in Sensex.Independent analysts SP Tulsian told CNBC-TV18 that currently, the firm has Rs 25,000 crore cash on hand. It is yet to be ascertained, whether the company is expecting to earn a cash profit of Rs 1.5 lakh crore for capex by FY16. There needs to be more clarity on why the firm has lined up aggressive capex, he said.He further said that though the company has high hopes from its three joint venture shale gas projects but a bigger concern is the declining KG-D6 output.Prakash Diwan from Altamount Capital Management added that the company will undertake equity raising programmes for its grand telecom business plan. But investors are disappointed with exploration and production segment which has been a drag for quite some time now and price revision is not seen happening in 2014.

Ambani, who heads India's leading business conglomerate Reliance Industries group, was paid a higher compensation of USD 276,816 by the bank in the previous year, 2011.Also read -Ambani joined Bank of America's board as an independent director in March 2011, but would step down from this position at the company's next Annual Meeting of shareholders on May 8.The US-based banking major announced last month that Ambani would step down as a director and join its new, non-fiduciary global advisory council.The bank has disclosed the compensation paid to Ambani and other details in a notice circulated to its shareholders ahead of their Annual Meeting on May 8.The bank also said that Ambani and five other directors currently on its board would not seek re-election at the Annual Meeting and would be replaced by new members on its board. The shareholders have been asked to ratify the changes.As per the shareholder notice, a copy of which has been filed with the US markets regulator SEC as well, Ambani's compensation for 2012 included USD 80,000 as 'fees earned or paid in cash' and USD 160,000 as stock awards.In comparison, Ambani got fees worth USD 92,282 in cash and USD 184,534 through stock awards in 2011 -- taking his total compensation for that year to USD 276,816.As on March 13, 2013, Ambani held a total of 31,265 shares of the bank, which have been given so far to him as part of his director compensation.As RIL Chairman, Ambani's remuneration is not known as yet for the last fiscal 2012-13 that ended last month.

Reliance needs more than the government’s nod to actually offer voice services over its 4G networkOn February 18, the Telecom Commission announced that holders of 4G LTE spectrum would be allowed to offer voice services after paying an additional Rs 1,658-crore fee to the government for a universal services licence. This gave rise to collective cries claiming that voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) is set to disrupt the telecom industry.The company that most analysts think may cause this disruption is, of course, Reliance Industries, the only operator with 4G LTE spectrum across India.But that disruption is not going to happen. Not now. Not next year. Not even in five years. Without an existing 2G or 3G telephony network, it is both technically and commercially impossible for Reliance Jio Infocomm, as the telecom venture is now called, to offer voice telephony.With no reliable global VoLTE standard, Reliance could offer voice communication to future subscribers through either specific devices or apps. But, that would be like you and your friend using Skype on your smartphones to talk to each other. It won’t work when there’s no data connectivity. It means you are allowed no calls when you are driving or outside city limits.But, what if Reliance smothers the country with 4G airwaves? Would it work then?Unfortunately for them, the 2,300 MHz spectrum, for which they paid about $3.5 billion, is one of the worst when it comes to creating a large area network. To provide the same kind of coverage in a city that, say, Airtel or Vodafone do for their subscribers, Reliance will need to put an exponentially higher number of towers in one shot.“Voice, because it’s ubiquitous, requires a better quality of experience. A data subscriber rarely notices fluctuations in speed, but a user in a moving vehicle will expect the same call quality throughout. Thus, for data services you can make initial investments and expand incrementally afterward, but for voice telephony, you need all investments up front,” says Alok Shende, founder and director of Ascendus, a telecom consulting firm.The one way VoLTE might make commercial sense is if Reliance acquires or partners with an existing mobile operator, such that its current 2G or 3G network becomes the fallback network that will carry voice calls or data when 4G airwaves aren’t around.Reliance might do it if it wants loyal customers. Because most data subscribers are fickle, and tend to quickly migrate to the next competitor who offers better speed or lower prices.",412,0.0

Iraq today shortlisted Reliance Industries and six other firms for developing its Nasiriya oilfield and the construction of an associated 300,000 barrels per day refinery.

Besides RIL, French energy giant Total, Russia's Lukoil, CNPC of China and American firm Brown Energy have been shortlisted for the project, according to Iraq's Oil Ministry. Russia's Zarubezhneft and JGC & Tonen General of Japan are the other two shortlisted from 14 companies that expressed interest in taking up the multi-billion dollar project.The seven qualified firms will now be invited to review data packages and discuss contract terms. Iraq intends to award the project by year end. The OPEC nation has three main refineries - Baiji, Daura and Basra -- with a total capacity of around 567,000 barrels per day (bpd). It wants to increase the refining capacity to 750,000 bpd through improvements in existing plants.It also plans four new refineries in Karbala, Kirkuk, Missan and in Nassiriya. ""The Al-Nasiriya Integrated Project contemplates the development of the 4+ billion barrel Nasiriya oil field in Thi-Qar province together with the construction and operation of a new 300,000 bpd refinery,"" Iraq's Petroleum Contracts & Licensing Directorate (PCLD), part of the Ministry of Oil, said.The international engineering and construction firm Foster Wheeler recently completed a Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) study for the refinery. The Nasiriya project marks re-entry of RIL into Iraq. The company's Dubai-based arm Reliance Exploration and Production DMCC had in 2007 taken a 100 per cent stake in the Rovi and Sarta blocks in Kurdistan.Baghdad termed the award of exploration contract to RIL and other firms by the autonomous Kurdistan region as illegal and threatened to blacklist any firm that dealt with the Kurds. A year after the blacklisting threat, RIL did not apply for being shortlisted for development of oil fields in Iraq.Thereafter, it did not figure in the list of companies applying to bid for successive licensing rounds of Iraq. RIL finally got rid of the Kurd blocks in July last year when it sold its stake to Chevron Corp for an undisclosed sum.With the Kurd baggage off its back, the company is back at doing business with Iraq and applied to be qualified for the Nassiriya project.

The ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) has allowed the GVK Group's gas-based power plant in East Godavari to use diesel as an alternate fuel after the company said gas supplies from Reliance's D-6 block was dwindling.

The expert appraisal committee (EAC) under the ministry had earlier rejected the group's proposal to use diesel as an alternate fuel at the plant, and advised it to approach the ministry of petroleum for its views on the matter.The panel, whose nod is required for any change in fuel use at power plants, changed its decision in the light of the oil ministry's move last month to abolish subsidy for bulk diesel purchasers. GVK is operating a 390 MW (expansion phase-II) gas-based power project at Jequrupadu near Krishna-Godavari basin in East Godavari district. ""In view of the information provided...the Committee finally recommended that HSD (high speed diesel) may be permitted as top up fuel only till 100 per cent natural gas supply is available,"" the EAC said recently after going through documents provided by GVK.GVK told the panel that gas supply from Reliance Industries had been declining and the current supply was about 0.5 MMSCMD instead of 1.1 MMSCMD required. As a consequence, the plant is operating at just 47 percent plant load factor. Due to continuous reduction in gas supply, energy dissemination to the grid has gone down. Hence, to meet the power demand of the grid, it is envisaged to use liquid fuel (HSD) instead of naphtha, GVK informed the EAC.The company had said use of HSD will be an interim arrangement till full natural gas supply is made available.The EAC had in 2012 rejected the proposal on the grounds that the HSD is a subsidised product and hence cannot be used for commercial purposes.However, the decontrol of diesel for bulk buyers paved the way for the gas-starved company to go for HSD as an alternate fuel to run the project. GVK has also obtained the oil ministry's NoC to use diesel. EAC observed that the government order prescribes that power producers using HSD could source their requirement of diesel from oil firms at mutually agreed terms and conditions.It asked GVK to institute a study on radiation due to release of mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the plant.",386,-0.928949773311615

RIL's appeal against Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) was earlier scheduled by SAT for tomorrow for admission, but the Tribunal has adjourned the hearing to January 11.While details of RIL's appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) could not be immediately obtained, Sebi has previously issued show-cause notices to the company in cases involving sale of shares of its erstwhile subsidiary Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) and allotment of shares to certain firms against warrants linked to privately placed debentures issued by RIL.Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has already replied to Sebi notices in these cases. In the case involving sale of shares of RPL, Sebi is said to have been investigating for a long time the alleged violation of insider trading regulations by RIL.RPL used to be a separately-listed company, but it was later acquired by RIL and the merger process was also completed way back in 2009. RIL has previously sought to settle the case through Sebi's consent mechanism, which allows for settlement of cases without admission or denial of guilt after payment of certain charges and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, if any.However, Sebi has rejected RIL's consent pleas on more than one occasion, terming the proposed payments as too less and on other grounds. As per the company's annual report for the fiscal year 2011-12, Sebi had issued it show-cause notices in connection with the sale of shares of erstwhile RPL and the allotment of RIL shares to certain companies against detachable warrants attached to privately placed debentures issued by it.""The company has submitted its reply to the same,"" RIL had said in the annual report. RIL is currently buying back shares under a programmelaunched in February last year and has repurchased shares over Rs 3,800 crore from public shareholders since then -- achieving 37 per cent of the targetted amount of Rs 10,440 crore.The buyback programme, already the biggest buy-back by an Indian company, would end on January 19, 2013. Yesterday, Sebi proposed significant changes to existing framework for buyback of shares by companies from open market, including lowering the process for its completion to three months and a minimum repurchase of 50 per cent of the target. The proposals have been made in a discussion paper floated by the market regulator and a final decision would taken after taking into account comments from the public.",431,0.0

SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com, says that after the change in management of OnMobile and considering the financials he is positive on the stock. He is also positive on select metal stocks.

A: I don't think that we have been seeing any problem for our market. Apart from Tuesday's rally we have been trading very cautious ahead of the fiscal cliff concerns for over a week. The was assumption that if nothing is materilised or no deal is reached then there will be a knee-jerk reaction so people were not creating or building up long positions.Since that issue has been put behind for the time being so we saw renewed interest coming in into our market. I maintain my positive view on January series in spite of fiscal cliff uncertainty. My advice is to buy and remain long.The affect of fiscal cliff is directly reflected into the rate sensitives like bank stocks, real estate, capital goods, automobiles and metals – all of them are doing quite well. Broadly, we can see effect of the fiscal cliff relief coming in.A: It is a matter of choice. Obviously, traders and investors both will look for ideas wherever they see opportunities and metals also gets added in that category. Now, one doesn't have confidence in the defensives like FMCG or IT. One has to be a risk taker in this market. Metal stocks both in ferrous or non-ferrous space is providing good buying opportunities and many are taking positions in this space.A: This stock corrected some couple of months back and there was a change in management since then I have been maintaining my positive stance. This stock is gaining some interest since last couple of days. The stock today is up by about 10 percent. I think the financials of the company will improve going forward. This is a good stock for investors who have a view of six months.A: I have an individual call on some high beta stocks and stocks in metal space. I have a positive stance on Strides Arcolab United Spirits maybe Apollo Hospitals Enterprises, BF Utility, Reliance Infrastructure and Reliance Capital , in fact they look quite good. Since the view for whole of January series is positive so one can look to trade on the long side in all these stocks.A: I have been maintaining my positive view on the stock from last 3-4 months. The company has a cash accrual of about Rs 300-400 crore on an annual basis even after knocking off the dividend. The company is making quarterly cash profit of over Rs 100 crore.If we add profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 60-70 crore and depreciation of Rs 30-35 crore. So, I don't think that repayment of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) falling due on 13th March for USD 250 million will be an issue. They have raised around USD 170 million via fresh FCCB coupled with the Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) to may repayment.I think now the stock is on a growth trajectory and one can expect earnings per share (EPS) of about Rs 10 plus for FY14. I expect the share to move to about Rs 85-90 by maybe April end or middle of May.A: The stock has been seen under accumulation maybe for last one month. The same applies for Reliance Capital also. I am expecting that breakout to happen in Reliance Capital which can take Reliance Capital to move to Rs 530 and Reliance Infra to Rs 590 to Rs 600. So both the stocks have been holding the levels and have been seen under accumulation for quite some time. So maybe the breakout has come today.A: The developments indicate that Eithad is quite keen with Kingfisher Airlines (KFA) and I think it is because of valuation. The enterprise value of KFA is around Rs 15000-16000 crore. In case of Jet it is around Rs 23000-24000 crore as the debt position is quite high at Rs 13000 crore. We have not seen any headway being made by the promoters of Kingfisher – UB Group either with respect to giving of revival plan to the DCGA or to the banks.KFA requires around Rs 3500-5000 crore to pay its bankers to ask for restructuring. Once this happens then Eithad will take interest in the airlines. KFA has high brand value and it they start operations then it will be easy for them to capture the market share of close to 15 percent. I am quite confident that the inclination of Eithad will be more on KFA but till then I’ll keep my positive stance on both the stocks.A: In last 30-45 days the stock saw a good run up. I don't have confidence in projections of real estate companies they at time move in different terrain. The company is doing quality development where realizations are higher. They are targeting a higher market share in Pune belt. At these levels the share should take a pause Rs 150. the stock can touch Rs 150 in next 6-12 months. However, one cannot expect anything beyond that price in whole of 2013.A: In the frontline, I would pick Associated Cement Companies ( ACC ) and Ultratech Cement . Again the stocks have seen a good run up but still I feel that the upside is quite good from hereon from these levels. In the smaller space I have a positive call on Century Textile Dalmia Bharat Enterprise , Binani Cement or Binani Zinc.In Binani Cement, the promoters are looking to divest their 40 percent stake and once that happens because some indications will start coming in, in the next couple of months in respect to the valuations. That can make the stock to move up. If you take JP Associates as a cement play, though it is a combination of infrastructure, real estate and cement, I have a positive stance on this stock as well.A: The numbers of TVS Motors are disappointment but things are on expected line for M&M or they are flat numbers.A: I have a positive view. I expect the market to remain bullish for the first half, maybe till middle of January so I have a target on the Nifty target of 6,100-6,150. So whole of this week seems to be quite positive because hereafter also we will see some positive effect coming in because of the rise in the global market, so maybe 2-3 days the positive upmove. We may have to be little cautious on Friday where we may see some mild profit booking coming in.",1098,0.0

In an interview to CNBC-TV18, SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com shared his reading and outlook on the market and stocks across various sectors.

Hotel Leela

is expected to fetch a return of 30-35 percent going ahaed. Tulsian is very positive on

Suzlon

and finds

PC Jewellers

quite expensive beyond Rs 150. Meanwhile, he suggested staying away from

Tata Motors

.

Below is the edited transcript of his interview to CNBC-TV18

Q: What is the sense that you are getting about the start of the New Year? Do you think that this consolidation phase would continue and frustrate traders for a while or do you see a breakout?

A: Unlikely that we will see frustration. Three weeks back when the series was started I was not expecting the Nifty to move beyond 6000 and that is what has exactly happened. I am keeping my positive stance. Maybe tomorrow or on Monday, we might see some good amount of buying coming. This can make the market move up largely to do with the better Net asset value (NAV) of the funds or maybe the better valuations of the stocks to calculate the bonus.

Apart from that even if you see the events lined up maybe for the first half of January 2013, I am expecting that some positive indications are likely from the US on account of the fiscal cliff. In addition to that once you have some positive trigger coming in that gets aided by the positive expectations start building up maybe on the RBI front and maybe some on the result fronts also. So, maybe the first half for January series is likely to be good. I am expecting a good amount of upsurge in the Nifty, a level of 6100-6150 maybe by middle of January.

Q: What are your view's with regards to the news on Hotel Leela and Reliance possibly picking up that office property in Chennai for Rs 172 crore?

A: I am going by couple of statements having issued by Hotel Leela management maybe in last four or six months. In case of hostile bid they openly said that they have done good homework and they do lookup on Reliance. In case anything happens they will come to rescue in the form of any arrangements.

Second could be in the form of monetisation of the surplus land or property. The management has categorically said that they are looking to make the company debt free in next one year. In fact, that is quite bold to take a call of making the company debt free in next one year. So, they are definitely looking for sale of the properties. They may look to sell some of the hotel projects also and some of the properties which is being sold to the Reliance Industries.

In fact they have surplus property in Mumbai also adjacent to Hotel Leela. They have a planning to monetize some of the other assets as well. So, definitely things will start happening on that front. If somebody can keep a view of one year on the stock, he can expect a return of 30-35 percent with very minimal downside risk there too.

Q: Any call with regards to Tata Motors and whether it would be a good buy above Rs 300 odd mark?

A: No, I will remain away. I see this more as a price management which is coinciding with the expiry. I am expecting that prices will correct. There is a lot of activity happening in individual stocks as well as in the index. This we call as the price management which coincides with the expiry. So, the firmness in the share price of Tata Motors is due to that. Maybe lot of activity must have happened in the Rs 300-310 Put and Calls and might continue in the future positions. So, I am expecting the corrections to happen in the January series and the price to slide to Rs 280-285 in next couple of weeks. So, suggest remaining away and not create long position.

Q: What about PC Jewellers, did that up move on the stock surprise you and where do you see the stock stabilise at?

A: Generally, we see this speculative activity coming in the newly listed stocks. This stock had the issue size of Rs 500 crore plus. They do not have this trade to trade category of placing because otherwise all the initial public offering (IPOs) that they get would have been placed there. I don’t rule out that speculative or maybe the momentum happening in the stock. The retail response was very tepid. A subscription of less than two, while the High Networth Individuals (HNI’S) have really gone and applied in the share.

I am not saying that these things are looking expensive but beyond Rs 150 the stock definitely looks quite expensive. Their expected turnover is Rs 4000 crore for FY13 with profit after tax (PAT) of about Rs 300 crore. This will translate into earnings per share (EPS) of Rs 17. That translates the share into a price-to-earnings (PE) multiple of eight times which definitely looks stretched. So, I will exercise my caution maybe beyond Rs 150.

_PAGEBREAK_

Q: Any view with regards to the news on Hindustan Oil Exploration Company (HOEC) earlier in the day?

A: I don’t know whether the stake sale can happen in the near term. We have been hearing this for last one year. In fact this kind of news has been coming in. So, if this time this deal happens one can look to have the deal happening at Rs 130-140. If you see the share holding pattern there are many loyal investors. HDFCs holding close to about 11-11.5 percent, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala is holding about 4-5 percent stake in the company.

So, definitely it is likely to have better valuations in the event the deal happens. That can make the share price to move to Rs 125. However, one has to have that certainty or surety of the deal going through.

Q:

GAIL

has seen a bit of a knock down around 2 percent odd. Any view in terms of why exactly GAIL would be down all of a sudden?

A: The stock has been languishing for last couple of months, maybe for the reason that things are not looking very great for the company, the fear of the subsidy sharing. In fact I would say that the stock has gone out of favour. Sometimes you do see OMCs coming back on the radar because of the

BPCL

having some oil and gas asset abroad. Still that kind of interest is not coming in on the GAIL. Continuous decline is seen in the stock. So it seems to have gone out of favour and just that could be the reason.

Q: Your call with regards to Suzlon and all of the developments that have taken place?

A: Bankers have been keeping a very positive view. They have been very keen to reschedule the loan of the company. They are keen that company should merge the REpower, the 100 percent subsidiary of the company. It is valued very richly at about USD 3 billion or thereabout. If one sees the topline of USD 5 billion for the company that also is quite assuring. Taking the developments, the bankers view and keeping in mind that yesterday promoters sold 2 percent stake in the company, indicates that they are very serious to see the loan.

The Herculean task before the company is to get the loan rescheduled. Once they have a breather of about couple of years or they have moratorium for interest payment and the installment payment they will definitely be able to take the call. So, keeping a positive stance downside is very limited. However, any positive indications maybe a move like merger of REpower with the Indian outfits. Or maybe once the reschedulement by the banks happens in respect to the company we can see a good up move of 20-25 percent.

The hiring plans were announced by Reliance Life Insurance Company (RLIC), part of Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group's financial services arm Reliance Capital Ltd, alongwith the launch of 'Career Agency', a new distribution channel aimed at enhancing the company's reach and footprints across the country.Under the new channel, RLIC plans to hire 5,500 career agents across 220 branches by end of 2012-13. Out of this, RLIC has already recruited around 2,500 career agents and deputed them at over 150 branches across the country and will hire about 3,000 career agents in the next three months.RLIC said it is a first-of-its-kind distribution channel by any private insurer in the country that is based on stipend and variable commission pay-out structure.""The main aim of Career Agency distribution format is to support new recruits during the learning phase so that they can concentrate on training and learning the ropes rather than being under the pressure of generating business to earn commission from the very first instance,"" RLIC President and Executive Director Malay Ghosh said.""We will help them devote the requisite time and effort to develop a good understanding of the industry and look at it as a long-term career option,"" he added.In the career agency distribution model, the recruited persons would be called 'sales trainees' and would be given a fixed stipend for a six-month training period. Once the advisor completes this training period and passes the licensing exam, the person would become a 'career agent' and moves to a variable commission-based pay-out structure.The career agency distribution format is a highly successful sales advisor model of RLIC's strategic partner Nippon Life and it has been now adapted to the Indian Market.The plan is aimed at focusing on Tier III and Tier IV cities and towns for hiring of prospective career agents.""The basic objective of this distribution model is to increase number of the sales people in the field working for the company full time,"" Ghosh said.The career agency is the third new distribution channel introduced by RLIC this year. Earlier, the company launched two new distribution models Life Plaza and Face-to-Face and added them in the existing sales formats.The company had a distribution network of 1,230 offices and over 1,50,000 advisors as on March 31, 2012.",411,

The fire broke out during maintenance on the unit, which was shut at the time, said Reliance spokesman Tushar Pania said.Pania said the fire was minor and was contained immediately.The company is still investigating the cause of the fire, he said, without providing details of the unit's capacity.No firm dates have been set yet for a separate planned maintenance at Reliance's newer 580,000 bpd Jamnagar refining complex in January, Pania said.The company is planning to shut a 13.5 metric tonnes per annum (270,000 bpd) crude distillation unit for about 40 days in January, industry sources have said.It is also planning to shut a 6.5 mmtpa vacuum gasoil hydrotreater unit, one of the sources said.",154,

With domestic output stagnating, India will become a net importer of natural gas in next two years with expensive LNG meeting rising energy demand of the growing economy.

Also read: Indian oil firms focus on production to get foreign assets Liquefied natural gas (natural gas cooled to its liquid form for ease of transporting in ships) imports at 39.32 million standard cubic meters per per day constituted 25.5 per cent of the total consumption of the fuel in the country in 2011-12.This share, according to petroleum ministry's latest estimates, will rise to 41 per cent in current fiscal and to 50 per cent in the next. In 2012-13, domestic natural gas production is estimated to be around 104 mmscmd, down from 114.90 mmscmd in the previous fiscal. In current year, LNG imports will jump to 73 mmscmd and are projected to further rise to 105 mmscmd in 2013-14, equalling the domestic gas production of that year.In 2014-15, imports at 115 mmscmd will surpass domestic production of 113 mmscmd, the ministry estimates said. For a nation whose current account deficit is already battered by 79 per cent reliance on imports for meeting oilneeds, higher share of LNG in the energy based will not be a good news.Industry officials said the domestic output has stagnated in absence of remunerative prices. UK's BP Plc, which partners Reliance Industries in theflagging KG-D6 gas block and other gas discovery areas, recently wrote to oil minister M Veerappa Moily saying around 5 trillion cubic feet of discoveries in KG-D6 and NEC-25 block in Mahanadi basin can be developed on priceclarity.The reserves RIL-BP has are more than the remaining resource in state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp's fields. Majority of domestic natural gas is priced at USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit which is one-third the price at which LNG is imported by Petronet LNG Ltd and other firms.The government has been resisting revising the domestic prices fearing its impact on power tariffs and fertiliser cost even as KG-D6 output plummeted to less than half to 24 mmscd. Industry officials said world over countries have raised price for domestic produce.Last week Argentina trippled wellhead price for new natural gas production to USD 7.50 per mmBtu. The South American nation too imported LNG at up to USD 15 per mmBtu rate, quite similar to the position in India. Neighbouring Pakistan too has announced a new exploration policy giving price of USD 7 for shallow water finds, USD 8 for deepsea discoveries and USD 9 for ultradeep exploration.China too has offered subsidises to energy companies who develop the nation's shale-gas resources, in an effort to jump-start the sector by lowering production costs.",454,0.0

India launched the Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme in late-September, an initiative that aims to bring millions of first-time investors into stocks by offering a tax incentive to deepen market liquidity and reduce a reliance on gold savings.

Following are details of how the scheme works:

* First-time Indian investors earning less than 1 million rupees a year would be eligible for a 50 percent tax break on stock investments of up to 50,000 rupees.

* Investors will have half of however much they invest deducted from their tax bill.

* Investors can buy stocks directly or through mutual funds or exchange traded funds.

* Eligible investments are restricted to the top-100 stocks traded on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange, as well as state-owned companies.

* The scheme imposes a 1-year blanket lock-in clause, meaning no changes can be made to the portfolio, and participants need to keep their money invested for at least three years.

* The scheme was proposed in the 2012-13 union budget by then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, and was launched on September 21.

* India wants to tap the potential of the savings conscious urban and semi-urban middle class and turn equities into an attractive alternative to gold and cash.

* The scheme is also intended to reduce markets' dependence on volatile foreign flows.",232,0.9999867677688599

Telecom major Bharti Airtel is the fourth largest mobile operator in the world with over 250 million connnections globally, according to analyst firm Wireless Intelligence. China Mobile continues to be at the top spot with 683.08 million connections, followed by Vodafone Group (386.88 million) and America Movil Group (251.83 million).

Bharti Airtel (250.04) and Telefonica Group (243.51) are at fourth and fifth position, respectively, Wireless Intelligence said in its 'Mobile operator worldwide group global ranking by connections (Q2, 2012)'.Besides China Unicom (which is at the sixth position), the report said Bharti Airtel is the only other member of the top ten to move up the ranking, recording a 13 per cent year-on-year rise in connections to overtake Telefonica.The other Indian telecom operators in the report are Reliance Communications Idea Cellular and BSNL at eigth, fourteenth and twentieth position, respectively.Bharti Airtel had become the fifth largest mobile operator in the world following its acquisition of Zain Group's mobile operations across 15 African nations in June 2010, the operator said in a statement.It, however, added that Bharti's mobile revenue at $3.04 billion in the second quarter of FY12 is significantly lower than the other operators in the top five, ""reflecting Bharti's presence in the ultra low-cost, low-margin Indian and African markets.""The other Indian telecom operators in the report are Reliance Communications, Idea Cellular and BSNL at eigth, fourteenth and twentieth position, respectively.

Amidst controversy over fall in output from RIL's KG-D6 gas fields, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) today appeared to favour scrapping the present system of contracts and instead asking firms to bid for the share of oil and gas they can offer to the government.

Under the existing Production Sharing Contracts (PSC), like the one RIL had signed for KG-D6 in 2000, companies are first allowed to recover all their cost before government gets its share of profit. This system had come in for sharp criticism from even the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) which said it incentivised companies by going on investing in oil and gas fields.""We have found it too difficult (to manage) the issue of cost recovery,"" DGH R N Choubey told reporters at the Petrotech 2012 conference when asked about the provisions of the existing PSC. ""It is difficult to assess the cost recovery and to assess the investment multiples and so on and so forth. We have found it difficult."" The existing model of PSC has come in for criticism following a sharp dip in output from RIL's eastern offshore KG-D6 gas fields. RIL has already recovered most of its investment from revenues earned from sale of natural gas even as output fell short of the targets.The government is now trying to punish the firm by restricting its cost recovery by over USD 1 billion. DGH, the upstream nodal arm of the Oil Ministry, favoured moving to a system where companies would be asked to bid for the share of oil and/or gas they would offer to government. The highest bidder would get the right to explore and produce. This way the government will be guaranteed its minimum take at all levels of production and it would not have to bother with monitoring of cost and its recovery.""There is a limit up to which you can improve the functionality of the existing PSC...because it is a signed contract so there is a limit. You cannot simply throw out everything,"" Choubey said. ""There is a limit up to which its functionality can be improved."" The government in May appointed a committee headed by C Rangarajan, Chairman of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, to review terms of the contracts signed by companies to explore and produce oil and gas and recommend necessary modifications for the future PSCs.The Rangarajan Committee, to which DGH is also a member, would submit its report by the month end, Choubey said. The panel has been asked to suggest ""structure and elements of the guidelines for determining the basis or formula for the price of domestically produced gas, and for monitoring actual price fixation.""",452,-0.9342296719551086
2012-10-16 09:32:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/-1985347.html,"It was a good day for the US markets overnight, so they have picked the mood up a little bit, its not that the SGX is running away today, but atleast a start in the green seems on the cards.

While today may not be a big day for the earnings calendar, the market will react to Reliance and Axis Bank numbers. In a sense, it is not a nothing results day. So, it may be stock specific and a little bit of a nudge up for the Nifty around that 5,700 as we start proceeding today, said Udayan Mukherjee, managing editor, CNBC-TV18.

The global cues were good yesterday and they are good today as well so we might get some support on account of that. Global markets too have been consolidating, but the fear going into October was that we will see a big correction. But nothing on the global screen is so far telling that we are about to collapse or we are about to meltdown.

This is a key takeaway that markets have just about boiled around these kinds of levels. We have seen a couple of days of a pullback, there was some simmering news from Europe and from the earnings calendar in the US, but none of it has broken the S&P down to 1,400 and below.

Markets are hanging in there and that itself is not a bad achievement after such a strong run over the last many weeks and months. So, the feeling was that October would be a month of correction for global markets but instead if it turns out to be a month of consolidation and no worse then it is a good outcome for equities all around.

The way the first half of October is headed, it seems to be that the chances of it being a month of consolidation rather than correction are appearing to be higher now, which will please a lot of the bullish crowd.

As far as our market is concerned, there is a little bit of a lull and it is in terms of both news flow and money flow. Money flows have just sort of ebbed out over the last few days and news flow after the frenetic policy measures everyday in September practically has sort of died down in October.

The market is just robbed a little bit of some fresh trigger at this point because it has priced in some of the good news and from hereon either it needs large dollops of money or it needs a restart of the news momentum to take it back up to those 5,800-6,000 kind of levels.

_PAGEBREAK_

In the absence of that the markets are pausing. But, the important thing here as well is that markets are pausing, they are not falling. There is no downward momentum at all out here. It has been a powerful 600 point rally. The markets gave up 150 points from the top, but then there was no follow-up to that momentum on the way down. For both global and local markets, we are in consolidation mode, but the kind of weakness that people were talking about for October is still not visible on the screen.

The market will not fall below 5,600 very easily because too many people have missed out. Typically, when so many people want a market to correct, it does not oblige quite so easily. So, it has been going there but coming back and now having gone to that 5,600 area couple of times and held out, the next thing that the market might easily choose to attempt is to go to the higher end and see if the higher end of the band is holding out, which is a move back to that 5,750-5,800 kind of zone.

I do not know whether it will be successful in taking it out, for that it requires a little bit of help in the global side and maybe a little bit of help from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Say in the next week or ten days, the market makes a slight upmove, gets back to that 5,820 kind of levels and then the RBI obliges with a rate cut, it is possible that the Nifty breakouts of that range on the way up as well.

For now, we are in that 5,600-5,800 kind of range, we have tested and held the lower end and now maybe it is trying to move a little higher. If global markets are supportive and results have not been too bad for the start of this week, we can try and edge higher and see if 5,800 can be tested and that can be taken out. The problem is that flows for the moment are not very strong. The FII numbers, which used to be Rs 700-800 crore a day, in the last couple of days it has been Rs 20 crore and Rs 50 crore. There is a little bit of a pause, which is robbing the market of some momentum.

If we just map how much FII money has come in the last four weeks since the reforms or the announcement started, we have sucked in a few billion dollars very quickly. It is a bit of a pause, people are waiting and watching. Even the FIIs which have invested the money might be just saying let us see there is so much talk that some of these policy announcements might not go through, let us wait and see what the earning season is like this time around and whether global markets do correct in October.

There are some imponderables out there, which probably have made FIIs sit on their hands for a bit. They are not selling but they are just saying, wait and watch, we have put in that money to work and now incremental money must need a little bit of triggers and clarity for us to deploy. The situation is pretty much that, a pause rather than any great sudden skepticism about the Indian market.",1012,-0.36661511063575747

Reliance Industries has asked the oil ministry to break the logjam and approval for its KGD6 capex plans of USD 1.6 bn for FY12 and FY13.

According to sources the government had verbally agreed to the capex plan on August 7 but still has to given written approval. The government wants to give approval once RIL agrees to the CAG undertaking a finance and performance audit. In a letter dated October 4, RIL asked the oil ministry to de-link the CAG audit and approvals for KGD6.",96,

Reliance Industries and partner BP Plc have warned of their KG-D6 gas field shutting down in 2015-16 if the government does not approve investments needed to keep the nation's largest gas fields alive.

""That is a fear,"" oil secretary G C Chaturvedi told reporters when asked if there was a possibility of the main producing fields in KG-D6 fields shutting down in future. Natural gas production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields and MA oil field in the Bay of Bengal KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block has slid to about 26 million standard cubic meters per day from 61.5 mmscmd achieved in March 2010. ""It (production) will keep coming down,"" Chaturvedi said.""We are convinced that in a do-nothing scenario, production will keep coming down."" RIL executive director PMS Prasad and BP India head Sashi Mukundan had in July met oil minister S Jaipal Reddy for nearly three and half hours to highlight the exigency facing the flagging KG-D6 fields due to his ministry not approving annual budgets and capital spending for three years.RIL-BP at the meeting had said output at KG-D6 will continue to fall in absence of interventions needed to revive some of the seven wells that had been shut due to water and sand ingress.Chaturvedi said through the annual investments were agreed upon in an Oil Ministry-controlled block oversight committee in August, the resolutions reflecting them haven't been signed due to certain issues. The oil ministry wants RIL to give Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) access to its books for conducting audit as a precondition for allowing future capitalexpenditure in the block.RIL says it is ready for any financial audit by CAG but will not agree on a performance audit, wherein technical decisions like selection of a particular technology or vendor for the complex deepsea operations may come in for questioning by a non-technical authority. It says CAG is not authorised to do a performance audit either under the Act it was formed or under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC).""We have told (RIL) that the audit will be under Section 1.9 of the PSC,"" Chaturvedi said. Section 1.9 provides for audit of charges and credits by a government auditor. BP in a statement on July 18 stated that it had attendeda joint meeting convened by the ministry on July 13 but refuted reports of a potential KG-D6 production shut-in. RIL holds geological uncertainties as well as high water and sand ingress in wells for the fall in production and hadat the beginning of the current fiscal projected an output of 27.6 mmscmd for 2012-13. This, as per its own projections, was to further dip to 22.6 mmscmd in 2013-14 and then to 20.4 mmscmd.",457,0.0

Reliance Industries today said it has signed an agreement with Venezuela for a project to produce heavy oil in the South American OPEC nation. RIL signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Venezuelan state oil monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela, or PdVSA, to develop a project in the Orinoco extra heavy crude belt, the company said in a statement here. Also, the firm signed a new agreement to buy more Venezuelan oil for its twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat.

""PDVSA will supply between 300,000 and 400,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan heavy crude oil to RIL's two refineries in Jamnagar under a 15-year crude oil supply contract,"" the statement said. RIL operates twin refineries at Jamnagar with a total refining capacity of 1.24 million barrels a day. Half of its crude diet can be heavy oil.RIL had in 2008 signed an agreement to buy 150,000 bpd of oil, which was gradually raised to 270,000 bpd at present. Under the new 15-year agreement, the South American country would sell between 300,000 bpd and 400,000 bpd beginning next year. Venezuela is important for RIL as it buys crude oil from the South American nation for its refineries in Jamnagar. The complex refineries of RIL are suitable to process relatively-cheaper Venezuelan crude where margins are high.PDVSA said earlier this month that it plans to raise overall shipments to India to 518,000 barrels a day by 2018. RIL may take up Venezuela's Boyaca 4 block and a separate section in the Ayacucho area of the Orinoco belt for development. Both these areas can produce 200,000 barrels per day (10 million tons a year) each.""As per the MoU, RIL will explore upstream options for joint participation in heavy oil projects of the Orinoco Oil Belt,"" the statement said. RIL would also cooperate with PdVSA by providing technical assistance and sharing its experience of executing large scale projects in areas of offshore upstream, refining and other downstream projects.""The signing of the contract and MoU marks furtherstrengthening of the long-standing relationship between RIL and PdVSA. RIL and PdVSA also plan to work together on studies of how to update and improve Venezuela's refinery network, as well as PdVSA's plans to tap offshore natural gas reserves, including the long-delayed Mariscal Sucre project, which is due to begin extraction before the end of this year.RIL was in 2009 supposed to bid with the Indian consortium of ONGC Videsh Ltd, Indian Oil Corp and Oil India Ltd for one of the three giant oil blocks Venezuela was offering the auction. It, however, walked out of theconsortium possibly because of delays in bidding. After RIL's exit, OVL-IOC-OIL teamed up with Repsol YPF SA, Spain's biggest oil company, and Malaysia's Petronas to made a successful bid for the massive Carabobo-1 project in Venezuela's Orinoco heavy oil belt. The field, which had about 50 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, can produce a minimum of 400,000 bpd of oil.",495,0.0

Reliance Industries is protesting against the oil ministry's newly-proposed exploration law, even though RIL had made several representations to the government for this very proposal, reports CNBC-TV18.

RIL had asked the government to be allowed to carry on with exploration activities through the life of the KGD6 and not just in the exploration phase of the field. The oil ministry has agreed but with a rider. The oil ministry's proposal does not allow cost recovery of dry wells, and this is what has upset RIL.The company in a letter to the oil ministry has said this violates production sharing contracts signed under the NELP regime, and has asked the government to reconsider the proposed law.",125,

Reliance Industries is likely to bid for mobile telephone spectrum in the upcoming auction to complement its wireless broadband services with voice call facility.

The oil-to-textile group headed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani is making a re-entry into the telecommunication business and is being talked as the most aggressive bidder in the November auction of telecom spectrum.Sitting on a cash-pile of Rs 70,732 crore at the end of the June quarter, RIL was the most notable participant at the pre-bid conference organised by the Department of Telecom (DoT) in the run-up to the auction.RIL is most likely to put a direct bid, a source privy to the development said. If for some reasons it is unable to make a bid by itself, the company may fund purchase of spectrum by another company and then acquire it. A company spokesperson declined to comment on speculation about the issue.The company had in 2010 re-entered the telecom space after it acquired Infotel Broadband which had won pan-India spectrum for offering high-speed internet broadband. The pan-India spectrum that RIL holds through InfotelBroadband does not has permission to provide voice calling facility.Any spectrum that does not allow voice calls is not a big revenue earner and so RIL as the next logical step would want to acquire spectrum which it can bundle its high speed mobile broadband service, the source said.The government plans to begin auction of spectrum vacated from cancellation of 122 telecom licenses by the Supreme Court, from November 12. The source said representatives of RIL subsidiary Infotel Broadband have been attended meetings organised by Department of Telecommunications on proposed spectrum auction.RIL entered in to telecom business by acquiring Infotel Broadband on the day the later won pan-India airwaves frequencies for Rs 12,847.71 crore in 2010. The company has already revealed its plan to use LTE technology for its country wide network deployment but is yet to start its services.Government has plans to auction airwaves frequencies in 1800 Mhz band and 800 Mhz band which are being currently used for GSM and CDMA mobile telephony services respectively. A new player bidding for 1800 will have to pay minimum of Rs 14,000 crore for pan-India services and for 800 Mhz band itis Rs 9,100 crore.According to auction rules, for 1800 Mhz band, new entrants will be required to bid for minimum of 4 blocks each of 1.25MHz in each service area and for 800 Mhz band it is minimum of 2 blocks each of 1.25MHz in each service area. RIL has plans to provide digital services in key domains of national interest such as education, healthcare, security, financial services, government-citizen interfaces and entertainment.",448,0.0

But while doing our investments - be it for our retirement or children education / marriage, we seldom feel the need to insure ourselves. In our busy daily lives (mostly of city dwellers), we often ignore or procrastinate, the decision to insure ourselves and our family adequately.

But now here's some good news. In order to compete with Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) of domestic insurance companies, now domestic mutual fund houses are reviving a scheme, whereby you'll be provided with an insurance cover as you invest in equity mutual fund scheme(s). It is noteworthy that such an investment- cum-insurance scheme was kept on the backburner almost for three years as the capital market regulator - Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the insurance regulator - Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), had crossed swords, after SEBI demanded part-regulation of ULIPs (as they were investment products as well). Thus, mutual fund houses that were set to launch an equity-insurance product too dropped plans to launch such schemes.But at present with the regulatory impasse easing, domestic mutual fund houses have once again started rolling out insurance-wrapped funds. Asset managers such as Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, Reliance, ICICI Prudential Mutual, among others have launched funds with an insurance cover over the past two to four months. Fund marketers are trying to make use of the negative perception surrounding ULIPs, especially about its cost structure and disclosures, to push their products.Most of the mutual fund houses have schemes with a maximum cover of upto Rs 20 lakh. These mutual fund schemes are structured in a way to pay out about 50 - 100 times the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) amount provided that an investor stays invested in the fund for two to three years. But, in case of redemption from a respective fund, the benefit of an insurance cover will not be offered. Moreover, the insurance cover shall start only after a waiting period of 60-90 days of enrolment; but in case of accidental death, the waiting period is not applicable.Thus in case an investor wants to enjoy an insurance cover as he / she SIPs into mutual funds, it will be imperative for one to stay invested over a long-term period of time.PersonalFN is of the view that, while insurance-wrapped mutual fund schemes is an innovative idea aimed at promoting long-term investing habits amongst investors, - and certainly a luring proposition; we think that investors should not enrol into a SIP of any mutual fund scheme merely because it is providing an insurance cover for free. One should select a winning mutual fund prudently, and thereafter opt to invest vide the SIP mode, and avail the insurance benefit, if available. Moreover one should not rely merely on insurance-wrapped mutual fund schemes to meet their insurance requirement, but instead also look at "" pure term insurance plans "" which are a cost-effective proposition to insurer you optimally. We are also of the view that investors should ideally deal with their insurance and investment needs separately. PersonalFN",518,0.0
