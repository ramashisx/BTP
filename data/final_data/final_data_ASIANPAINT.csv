Shares of paint manufacturers rose in the morning trade on November 17 as crude prices dropped to a four-month low, sparking hopes of lower input costs.

Crude derivatives are key raw materials for paint manufacturing, accounting for almost 40 percent of the input bill for paint manufacturers. A fall in the price of crude can mean wider profit margins.

The benchmark Brent crude has fallen around 6 percent in the past two sessions to a four-month low of $76.60 a barrel on the back of a higher-than-expected rise in US inventories. Aside from that, a rebound in US treasury yields and concerns over global oil demand also contributed to the price fall.

Akzo Nobel India, Berger Paints, Indigo Paints, and Shalimar Paints jumped up to 3 percent in trade. Asian Paints was the leader of the pack, jumping 3 percent to emerge as a Nifty top gainer.

Expectations of demand recovery in the October-December quarter, which also aligns with the current decline in crude prices, also aided the sentiment.

In addition, Asian Paints announced a marginal 1 percent price cut from November 1, which, according to Macquarie, suggests an improved clarity on the input cost trajectory. The global brokerage firm has an ""outperform"" call on the stock with a price target of Rs 3,800.

Some concerns for the sector, however, still persist, as Grasim's plans to enter the paints business by the fourth quarter of the current fiscal draws close. The entry of a big-shot player poses a threat of increased competitive intensity for paint manufacturers.

HDFC Securities' research report on Asian Paints

APNT’s revenue growth flat-lined in Q2 (YoY) at INR 84.8bn, 4.4% below our expectation (HSIE: INR88.7bn). Decorative business clocked 6/1.1% volume/value growth in Q2FY24. The mix was economy range-heavy. Urban markets (high-single-digit growth) continued to outpace rural centres. Normalising input costs coupled with operational and formulation efficiencies led to margin expansion. GM/EBITDAM grew 764/573bps respectively to 43.4/20.2% (HSIE: 41.5/20.3%). We’ve cut our FY25/26 EPS estimates by 5-6% each to account for higher A&P spends/incentives (targeted to spruce up demand amid rising competitive intensity).

Outlook

Maintain REDUCE with a DCFbased TP of INR 3,000/sh (earlier: INR 3,200/sh), implying 48x Sep-25 P/E.

ICICI Securities research report on Asian Paints

We reckon paint volumes declined for APNT in 2QFY24. We expect growth triggers to be muted in the near term considering (1) weak consumer sentiment may impact volume offtake, (2) international business will likely be under pressure due to geopolitical concerns, (3) rising competitive pressures due to entry by Grasim and (4) limited scope for margin expansion as the benefit of deflation in commodity prices is largely over by the end of Q2FY24 and margins are near peak now. While B2B demand is likely to be strong, we believe it is likely to be low margin and low RoCE. In our view, the stock price performance of Asian Paints will be driven the pricing strategy and aggression by Grasim. REDUCE.

Outlook

We model Asian Paints to report revenue and PAT CAGR of 8% and 11.2%, respectively over FY23-26. We believe the valuations (P/E of 51.4x FY26E) are stretched considering the increase in competitive pressure and the limited scope for margin expansion. Our DCF based revised target price is INR 2,740. Maintain REDUCE.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Asian Paints

APNT reported volume growth of 6% in 2QFY24 (est. 8%). The management highlighted a top-line moderation, citing weakened consumer sentiment and emphasizing the sensitivity of demand growth to unpredictable rainfall patterns. Additionally, a decline in demand was observed in rural markets, with urban centers showing better performance than their rural counterparts. Gross margins currently reside at the highest levels observed in the last 10 quarters. However, looking ahead, there is an anticipation of potential upward movement in input costs. This is influenced by larger geopolitical factors and currency fluctuations, particularly expecting an upswing in material prices, especially those derived from crude.

Outlook

The management has given guidance for the EBITDA margin to be in the range of 18-20%. Management expresses optimism for an extended festival season, foreseeing a rise in rural growth in 2HFY24, buoyed by expectations of a bountiful harvest and an improving economy, supported by effective government spending. APNT’s valuations are fair at 54xFY24E and 48xFY25E EPS. We retain our Neutral rating with a TP of INR3,100 (based on 50xFY25E EPS).

Sharekhan's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints (APL) registered yet another muted quarter with revenues standing flat at Rs. 8,478 crore while a 573 bps y-o-y expansion in OPM to 20.2% led to 55% y-o-y growth in the PAT to Rs. 1,232.4 crore. Decorative paint volume growth slowed to 6% in Q2 due to shift of festive in Q3 and an erratic monsoon that hit consumer sentiments. Q3 would see volume growth improve to double digits on an extended festive season and strong wedding demand. OPM came in at 20.2% in Q2FY24 due to change in mix (versus 21.7% in H1FY24). Any significant increase in crude prices would pose a risk to margins. Management maintained its guidance of 18-20% OPM for FY2024.

Outlook

Stock trades at 55.1x and 46.6x its FY2024E and FY2025E EPS. Heightened competition in the domestic paint business might keep toll on margins and valuation in the near term. We maintain Hold with a revised PT of Rs. 3,180.

We cut FY24/25 EPS estimates by 3.1/4% following lower than expected volume growth and profitability in 2Q24. APNT has given optimistic outlook for 2H24 given rebound in demand in sept and expected pick up in festival season. Overall volume growth of 6% has been below our estimates given tepid rural demand and delayed festival season. We expect double digit volume growth in 2H while most gains from RM deflation have been mostly realized. IBD margins remain under pressure with uncertain currency outlook. Home décor is showing mixed growth due to high base in kitchen and bath segments while “Beautiful Homes” continues to scale up. APNT’s growth levers are intact given 1) market share gains in decorative paints 2) sustained increase in distribution (addition of 2.5k retail touch points in 2Q24 to 160k) 3) high growth in waterproofing/wood finishes/ projects business and 4) scalability plans in home décor from 4-5% to 8-10% of sales by FY26 (both organic and inorganic).

Asian Paints posted muted revenue growth in Q2 FY24, lagged market expectations, but brokerages haven't yet lost hope as they expect the company to see better days in the October-December quarter.

The subdued revenue growth in Q2 was on account of a delayed festive season and erratic monsoon, which heavily weighed on consumer demand. Adding to that, the second quarter is generally a weak one for paint manufacturers.

At 09.22 am, shares of Asian Paints were trading around a percent lower at Rs 2,936.20 on the NSE.

However, the company is set to enjoy the benefits of the delayed festive season in Q3. Brokerages such as Morgan Stanley, Nuvama Institutional Equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services and HSBC forecast a strong rebound in volumes and revenue growth for Asian Paints in Q3.

Concerns around the hardening of crude prices and Grasim's foray into the paints business being round the corner still prevail.

In such a situation, the management's optimism for an extended festival season, foreseeing a rise in rural growth in H2 FY24, buoyed by expectations of a bountiful harvest and an improving economy due to effective government spending ushers confidence, as stated by MOFSL.

Recovery on the cards

Brokerage firm Jefferies has an 'underperform' call on Asian Paints with a price target of Rs 2,500. It remains positive on the management's bullishness and believes that the shift in the season in Q3 could show up in double-digit volume growth for the paintmaker.

The management has also guided for a double-digit volume growth for Q3 and FY24 along with expectations of rural demand picking up in the coming quarters.

Supporting the view, Morgan Stanley also expects Q3 growth to be strong amidst a delay in the festive season. The firm has an 'underweight' call on Asian Paints with a price target of Rs 2,702.

On the other hand, HSBC was impressed by the margin expansion showcased by Asian Paints and believes that it remains on upward trajectory. The brokerage also backed expectations of a rebound in volume growth in Q3.

""The outlook for the second half of FY24 remains strong and the valuations for Asian Paints also look appealing,"" the firm stated in a note. HSBC has a 'buy' call on the stock with a bullish price target of Rs 4,000.

Crude concerns persist

The upward move on crude prices amidst growing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East as the company had started enjoying the benefits of lower raw material prices is a major concern for most brokerages.

Nuvama, which has a 'buy' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 3,505, also sees a spike in raw material prices given geopolitical issues and a lag in rural recovery as major downside risks for Asian Paints.

""Looking ahead, there is an anticipation of potential upward movement in input costs. This is influenced by larger geopolitical factors and currency fluctuations, particularly expecting an upswing in material prices, especially those derived from crude,"" MOFSL mentioned in its report. The firm has a 'neutral' rating for Asian Paints with a price target of Rs 3,100.

Adding to that, Jefferies also highlighted that Grasim's entry into the paints business is just six months away now, which causes heightened uncertainty for Asian Paints.

Despite crude prices trending upwards of $90 per barrel, paint majors are not looking at price hikes this financial year. The industry had hiked rates by 20-25 percent in FY21-22, and prices have been stable since then, said JSW Paints’ chief executive officer AS Sundaresan, in a conversation with Moneycontrol. “The paints industry does not have a tendency to roll back price hikes. That’s why we have enough buffer to protect margins despite crude prices trending up again. Companies will reduce rebates and discounts to protect margins,” he said.

This has already started. According to ICICI Securities, paint companies were offering higher trade schemes since the beginning of CY23, which continued till August, 2023. Most dealers passed on partial benefits to end-consumers as well. However, the schemes and discounts have slowed down after August, when crude prices started rising again.

“Crude comprises about 30-40 percent of the cost of raw materials for paint companies. Coupled with that, 7-8 percent of the cost of freight is also impacted by crude prices,” said Sundaresan.

What next for JSW Paints?

JSW Paints clocked more than Rs 1,500 crore in revenues in FY22-23. Currently, the decorative paints segment comprises 55 percent of its revenues, and industrial paints comprise 45 percent. “This is now trending towards a 60-40 split. The decorative business doubled in FY22-23, and our aim is to double every year,” Sundaresan added.

The company has a capacity of 100 million litres in the decorative segment and plans to expand this to 160 million litres, through brownfield expansion and investment of Rs 60-80 crore. In the industrial segment, the company has a capacity of 50 million litres.

“In industrial paints, we started out with coil coatings but have expanded to other segments. We are the only paints player to take up paint jobs for large industrial complexes,” said Sundaresan.

“We have empanelled contractors who take up the painting of entire steel plants. Like the decorative segment, we offer end-to-end painting services in the industrial side now,” he added.

JSW Paints’ products reach 6,000-odd retailers across the country, and it has a market share of 3.5 percent. It aims to gain 1 percent-plus market share every year, and the near-term goal is to have more than 5 percent share by 2025. For this, it continues to stick to its unique selling proposition of ‘Any Colour, One Price.’

Grasim’s entry

Grasim Industries is set to launch its paints business under the brand name Birla Opus from Q4 FY23-24. The company has said that it will offer a full suite of high-quality products in the decorative paints segment. Depending on how market leader Asian Paints reacts, other players will follow suit.

“With every new player’s entry into the industry, a new feature has come along. Be it niche products, specialty products, value-added products, etc. This will only help the consumer get more involved in the paint-buying process. Right now, they just end up selecting the colour,” Sundaresan said.

While Grasim will have a production capacity of 1,300 million litres, Asian Paints is now expanding to 2,636 million litres. “Pricing action will be based on what the market leader does. Remember, customers have a mindset that a low priced paint is inferior in quality. So, we will have to wait and see if a price war plays out,” explained Sundaresan.",591,0.9907787640889486

Marcellus Investment Managers believes that its ‘consistent compounders’, the likes of Asian Paints, Divi's, Bajaj Finance, will continue to maintain their dominance in the market amid heightened competition on the back of strong moats. Even with the threat of Grasim's big bang entry into paints segment looming large, star fund manager Saurabh Mukherjea is certain that Asian Paints will hold on to its market share.

A note by Marcellus says that companies which are able to demonstrate the ability of strong moats over decades are the ones that have built and continuously strengthened their competitive positioning against its peers. While on the surface it may appear that a new competitor poses a credible threat to the market leader, making a judgment about this without really understanding how strong the leading company's moat is can be very risky.

The note gives an example of a new IPL cricket team, backed by a wealthy owner, would pose a challenge to the champions who have dominated the league consistently over several years. However, it is difficult for the new team to defeat the leaders as the team needs brilliance and something more than just a large balance sheet.

Talking about Asian Paints it says that the company’s moat comes from its paint dealers. Asian Paints has close relationship with paint dealers who make money by selling the company’s products because of its efficient logistics system. While it may appear that a new entrant can easily persuade a paint dealer to push its products through higher margins, such a strategy is unlikely to work without adversely impacting the new entrant’s financial position. “The win-win solutions adopted by the likes of Asian Paints takes decades to establish and unless the incumbent grows lethargic, such an incumbent is incredibly difficult to dislodge,” as per the note.

In the context of Grasim’s entry in the paint industry, Marcellus says that spending money on factories doesn't necessarily guarantee sales or a big market share. If it was the case, multi-national paint players in India – who were never short of money to invest in creating capacities – would also be market leaders, said the note. While other paint companies are building capacities, Asian Paints has doubled its reach in rural areas and invested in making their paint cheaper.

Talking about Divi’s Laboratories it said that the company has three strengths. The company is 100 percent IP compliant. It is a non-competing service provider to its clients which are the world’s largest pharma companies, and it has a high-quality manufacturing process which also scores highly on regulatory compliance

In the financial year ended March, Asian Paints reported revenue of $4.1 billion, indicating an increase of 19 percent from the previous year, states the report.

Forbes, on October 12, released its list of India's 100 richest people for 2023. The list saw rank reclaims, returnees, new entrants, and drop-offs along with three interesting debuts.

Dani family of Asian Paints

Ranked at 22, the Dani family from Mumbai made an impressive entry to the Indian billionaires' list for 2023 with a fortune of $8 billion. The Dani family comprises the heirs of the former non-executive director of Asian Paints, Ashwin Dani, who passed away on September 28.

As per a report by the Forbes magazine, Ashwin Dani’s net worth was $8 billion at the time of his passing. In the financial year ended March, Asian Paints reported revenue of $4.1 billion, indicating an increase of 19 percent from the previous year, states the report.

Asian Paints has major presence in Asia as one of the biggest paint companies in the continent. The paint giant gains 98 percent of its annual revenue from the domestic market. It also offers home painting services and interior design services.

Renuka Jagtiani of Landmark Group

Chairwoman of Dubai-based retail giant Landmark Group, Renuka Jagtiani, joined the intriguing list of India's billionaires this year, ranked at 44 with a fortune of $4.8 billion. Jagtiani's entry to the list comes after the demise of the company's former chairman, Mukesh Wadhumal ""Micky"" Jagtiani, also her husband, early this May. He was ranked 511 on the Forbes' 37th annual world's billionaires list earlier this year.

Renuka Jagtiani has been heading the company's corporate strategy and expansion into new markets for more than two decades. She oversees more than 50,000 employees as the company head.

She also ranked 96th in the Forbes 2021 list of the world's most powerful women, however, was dropped off later in 2022.

Jagtiani joined Landmark group back in 1993, marking a notable act with her fast-fashion venture - Splash. At present, Splash enjoys a strong foothold, with its presence in more than 200 stores across 11 countries in the Middle East and Africa.

Following this, the Landmark chairwoman assisted in establishing the company's India arm in 1999. The Landmark Indian unit is spread across 900 stores across five verticals, which include Lifestyle, a department store chain, Home Centre, and Max. Jagtiani took over as the chairwoman and CEO in 2017 but stepped down from the latter role in 2022.

The Forbes 100 richest Indians debutant has inherited a fortune of $4.8 billion from her husband and also meticulously lined up the Jagtiani family's next generation to ensure a smooth transition of legacy. Her three children — Aarti, Nisha, and Rahul — currently serve as the group directors heading various verticals of the company.

KP Ramasamy & family of KPR Mill

Ranked at 100 on India's 100 richest list for 2023 is the family of KP Ramasamy, founder, and chairman of textiles and sugar maker KPR Mill. The KP Ramaswamy family made its debut on the billionaires list with a fortune of $2.3 billion, which is shared by the three Ramaswamy brothers.

The Coimbatore-based KPR Mills, manufactures knitted apparel, cotton, and polyester yarn, along with sugar and ethanol. In addition, it produces men’s innerwear under the Faso brand, which was started in 2019. KPR expanded into sugar production in 2013.

The company, which was founded in 1984, manufactures 128 million garments every year, which are then retailed to global giants, such as H&M, Marks & Spencer, and Walmart, as per the report.

KPR Mills' latest unit in Tamil Nadu's Erode has the capacity to produce 42 million garments annually, according to a report by Forbes. It would also be interesting to note that of the 30,000 people employed by the company, 90 percent are women.

Meanwhile, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, Mukesh Ambani reclaimed the top position on the 2023 Forbes list of India’s 100 Richest with a net worth of $92 billion. Zerodha co-founder, Nikhil Kamath, is officially the youngest billionaire at 37. Ranked 40 among the richest persons in India, the combined net worth of brothers Nithin and Nikhil Kamath currently stands at $5.5 billion.

The collective wealth of India’s 100 Richest was flat at $799 billion for 2023, according to the report released by Forbes on October 12. According to the report, while India's stock market zoomed 14 percent since fortunes were last accessed, a persistent weaker Rupee muted the collective net worth of India's richest.

This list was compiled using shareholding and financial information obtained from families and individuals, stock exchanges, analysts, and India’s regulatory agencies. Public fortunes were calculated based on stock prices and exchange rates as of September 22. Private companies were valued based on similar companies that are publicly traded.

Asian Paints non-executive director Ashwin Dani, who died at 79 on Thursday, had revealed during an award ceremony that despite getting through IIM and having paid the fees, he decided against getting an MBA and chose to get a work experience first.

Speaking after getting a lifetime achievement award from CNBCTV18 last year, a second-generation scion of the family that co-founded Asian Paints, said that the company was the only Indian firm manufacturing paints in the country while all the others were British and were unwilling to share their technology. That's when Dani decided to learn the technology from institutes such as the Mumbai University for Asian Paints to manufacture their products independently.

""When I entered the paint industry, among the top seven paint companies, Asian Paints was the only Indian company, all others were British. And nobody wanted to give us the technology at that time,"" Ashwin Dani said. ""Our then chairman told me 'Ashwin, there is no other alternative but to be atmanirbhar' at that time. And that is why in the first 20 years, I've worked at the Bhandup factory, (visiting) in the morning at 8.30, and developed the products.""

He also thanked Mumbai University for training him, before he went to the US to pursue a Master’s degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Akron.

""Not preferring to join IIM in '65 after having gotten admission and paid the fees. Would any of the youngsters do so in today's time? No,"" Dani said. ""Because MBA is so deeply embedded... In every industry, you must achieve some kind of work experience first, and then only you can apply any norms of management. That's what I practiced and today, if you combine the numbers of the top three paint companies, they cannot match our sales.""

Dani started his journey at Asian Paints in 1968 as a senior executive and rose through the ranks to eventually lead the company. Dani’s contribution was instrumental to the company's growth as the largest paint maker in the country with a group turnover of Rs 21,700 crore.

As of 2023, Ashwin Dani's net worth is estimated to be approximately $7.1 billion, according to Forbes.

Over the last two days, shares of Asian Paints have seen a 2.5 percent decline. The surge in oil prices has indeed adversely impacted the paint manufacturing industry, primarily because many raw materials used in paints are petroleum-based. The increase in input costs for important raw materials could impact the total manufacturing cost and in turn pressure on margins of paint companies.

Geojit's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints Ltd. (APNT), is engaged in the business of manufacturing, selling and distribution of paints and related products for home décor. APNT is the market leader in the Indian paint manufacturing industry. APNT maintained double digit volume growth of 10% YoY, aided by improving rural demand. While revenue grew by 6.7% YoY in Q1FY24. EBITDA margin expanded by 502bps YoY to 23.1%, supported by a fall in raw material prices and efficient sourcing of raw materials. Robust demand and expansion in the distribution network supported the decorative volumes, while industrial paint demand was supported by the Auto segments. Good progress in the monsoon and a longer festival season augur well for peak season demand.

Outlook

Superior product mix and comfort with moderating raw material prices bode well for profitability. We increase FY24 & FY25 earnings forecasts by 5%/2%, respectively, in expectation of margin expansion. We revise our rating to BUY with a TP of Rs. 3,691, based on a P/E of 60x on FY25E EPS.

Hindustan Unilever, Titan, and Asian Paints have fewer buy calls on their stock in August as compared to last month.

Hindustan Unilever had 36 buy calls in July, but this number has reduced to 26 buy calls in August. Brokerages have downgraded Hindustan Unilever stock from a ‘buy’ rating to a ‘hold’ or ‘neutral’ rating.

Prabhudas Lilladher downgraded its rating on Hindustan Unilever to ‘hold’ from ‘accumulate’ before. The downgrade was done factoring in tepid volume growth in the food and refreshment and personal wash segments in the April-to-June quarter.

Also Read: HUL Q1 disappoints on weak demand, volume growth at 3%

The domestic brokerage firm said that HUL’s price cut strategy to compete with local players will diminish in the longer run. This means that the excitement around lower prices will fade away gradually as people get used to the new prices, making it less effective in the long run. Rural markets have, however, started to improve. Prabhudas Lilladher expects erratic weather conditions to increase inflation in daily use items and disrupt Hindustan Unilever’s volume recovery path.

Yes Securities has cut its rating on Hindustan Unilever to ‘neutral’ from ‘add’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 2,890. The brokerage firm sees limited upside on the stock in anticipation of a slower volume growth in coming quarters.

Yes Securities said that even tough rural markets are showing improvement and that demand in rural areas will come back slowly as people are still using the high priced inventory in the market. Resurgence of small players and reducing stock levels in anticipation of further input price cuts will also lead to slower volume growth for Hindustan Unilever.

Titan

Titan had 27 buy calls in July, and now has 23. Phillip Capital has downgraded the stock to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 3,100. Phillip Capital expects increased advertising spends to lower margins further as Titan is investing on above-the-line and below-the-line activities to increase its market share. Above-the-line usually refers to costs above the gross profit, which includes cost of goods sold -- cost of raw materials, wages, other facilities costs which go into producing the goods. Below-the-line expenses include operating expenses, interest and taxes.

Also Read: Titan Q1 results: Net profit falls 4.3% to Rs 756 crore; revenue up 26%, misses estimates

The brokerage firm expects consumer demand to moderate on account of higher gold prices and pent-up demand. The brokerage firm believes that Titan has rich valuations and the stock does not see any meaningful appreciation.

Another brokerage DART has cut its rating for Titan to ‘sell’ with a target price of Rs 2,980 as it believes the stock has become expensive. The brokerage firm said, “Although Titan’s Q1 profitability was lower than estimates, we maintain our FY24-25 Earnings Per Share estimates at Rs 42.5 in FY24 and 48.5 in FY25 as we believe that the profitability going ahead would improve significantly.”

Asian Paints

Asian Paints now have 12 buy calls, down from 15 in July. Axis Securities has cut the rating to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 3,500. The brokerage firm believes the stock has limited upside potential in the near-term as competition from the new entrants is likely to intensify. And this will keep the profitability under check. However, Axis Securities is positive on the long-term prospects of the company.

Also Read: Asian Paints net profit jumps 52% on double‐digit volume growth in Indian decorative business

Prabhudas Lilladher has cut the rating from ‘accumulate’ to ‘hold’ earlier, given the EPS valuations of 53.5x in FY25 and increased competition from Grasim and JSW in coming years. However, the brokerage firm is positive on long-term growth levers for Asian Paints on the back of the company’s increasing market share in decorative paints and high growth in waterproofing and the wood finishes business.

The market made a strong comeback on Monday, but doubts linger if the current round of correction may have run its course. Bulls are holding their breath till the Nifty decisively closes above the psychological 20,000 mark. Meanwhile, investors continue to scour for opportunities in the small and micro cap space.

Hindustan Copper

Traders have taken a shine to Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL) over the last three months, with the stock regularly figuring on the NSE’s F&O ban list. HCL has rallied over 40 percent from its lows in March even as the outlook on global prices has been hazy. On Monday, the stock surged 10 percent back with trading volumes at a near eight-month high. One possible explanation could the recent strength in copper prices, which have risen to a three-month high on hopes of a recovery in demand in China and possible supply shortage.

Last week, Chilean copper mining giant Codelco lowered its annual

production guidance and raised cost estimates. For a commodity stock, HCL is not exactly cheap at 46 times trailing 12-month earnings, but it is also the only pure play on copper among listed companies. The fourth quarter numbers were better than market expectations, and the street appears to be betting on a similar performance in the June quarter as well.

There is no talk yet about a potential divestment, though it looks like there would be enough interested parties if the government chose to walk that path. “I think on Hindustan Copper, we will certainly be taking a very good look,” Hindalco MD Satish Pai had told CNBC-TV18 in May when asked if Hindalco would be interested in Hindustan Copper and NALCO in the event of a likely divestment.

Asian Paints

The initial excitement over the strong first quarter numbers appear to have worn off as the market is again fretting about the possible impact on profit margins as Grasim steps up its game in the paints business. In general, the market has not been overly kind to richly valued stocks in the recent rally. Asian Paints’ trouble seems to a risky cocktail of expensive valuation at a time when the competition is set to get fiercer. Analysts expect Asian Paints to retain its dominant position in the long term, but it is the here and now that is making the street anxious.

“In the medium term, entire paint industry might face margin pressure (which we expect to start hitting from FY25 onwards) as new entrants dole out higher incentives to influencers in order to grab market share, which might compel even market leader to match same structure,” write Phillip Capital analysts Vishal Gutka and Binay Shukla in their note.

Indian Energy Exchange

The selling pressure in the stock may have abated for now, but from the tone of the analyst review notes suggest that the possibility of a meaningful upside in the foreseeable future appears slim. The government’s push for a market coupling operator was the first blow for IEX, and now analysts see aggressive capacity addition in the renewables energy space as another threat. The bad news does not end there. According to Antique Stock Broking analysts Rohit Natrajan and Pranav Furia, the soon-to-be-implemented Grid Code aims to bridge the gap between spot prices and term prices. Once that happens, power DISCOMs will have less incentives to buy from the spot market, the duo write.

Indus Towers

The stock has had a decent run from the lows of April, but it does not seem to be out of the woods yet. Citi has retained its 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 210 post June quarter earnings, citing the tower additions led by Bharti Airtel as a long term growth opportunity. Recently, some HNIs have piled on to the stock, betting on Idea Vodafone’s financial health improving with a likely dose of equity infusion. But there are sceptics as well.

Motilal Oswal has retained its 'neutral' call on the stock post the earnings. Its key concerns are two-fold: One, while Indus is benefiting from the aggressive site additions from Bharti along with 5G rollout, these are single tenancy sites. That is a drawback because multi-tenancy sites, where multiple operators share the same tower, tend to be more cost-efficient and can generate higher returns as they serve multiple customers. But the bigger worry is about Vodafone Idea’s health, about which Motilal Oswal is not as optimistic as the recent buyers in the stock.

“VIL’s weak outlook and limited funding capability could a.) dilute tenancies in the near term and b) put risk on the long-term tower sharing-led business model,” says the Motilal Oswal report.

India to the Rescue

When one door closes, another opens. Australian mining giant BHP can attest to this truism at the moment. After hit by a Chinese ban on Australian products, BHP is betting on the expansion of India’s steel industry to come to the rescue of its coal business, FT reports. Around 40 per cent of BHP’s coking coal — used by steel mills — is now heading to India, up from 30 per cent in 2019. India is targeting to grow its steel production to 300 million tonnes a year by the end of this decade, from 125 million tonnes last year. The country’s rapid urbanisation, infrastructure spending and growing industrial sector are seen as key drivers for steel demand.

Retail Retreat

While most investors are tripping over themselves to pour money into stocks, China’s retail investors are making a doleful trek in the opposite direction, exasperated by lacklustre returns. The country’s 200-million-strong individual investors are increasingly putting their cash into money-market funds, insurance products and bank savings accounts, WSJ reports.

China’s benchmark CSI 300 index lost around a fifth of its value last year amid its strict Covid lockdown, and has underperformed most of its global peers in 2023 so far. Unlike other countries, where large institutions dominate trading, China’s stock market is still driven by its 219 million individual investors, who accounted for around 60 percent of trading volumes last year.

ICICI Securities research report on Asian Paints

While Q1FY24 PAT growth of 48.9% YoY was higher than consensus estimates, the results were qualitatively weaker in our view as (1) In-spite of delay in monsoon and stronger Apr’23, the revenue growth was muted at 6.7% YoY, (2) volume growth was 330bps higher than revenue growth indicating mix deterioration and higher volumes of low value products such as putty and (3) B2B portfolio (Industrial paints and Projects) has reported double digit revenue growth indicating weaker growth of consumer portfolio. APNT is likely to report EBITDA margin (Q1FY24 standalone: 24.6%) higher than its target range of 18-20% in FY24 due to lower RM prices. However, we believe the margin expansion is likely to be short lived and is likely to correct with increase in competitive intensity from Q4FY24. Maintain REDUCE.

Outlook

Motilal Oswal's research report on Asian Paints

APNT reported strong volume growth of 10% in 1QFY24 (est. 8%). The management attributed this growth to the strong performance of the economy and premium segments, although the luxury segment lagged behind. Additionally, the company observed an improvement in rural markets, with rural and urban markets coming closer in terms of performance. The increase in gross margin was attributed to the softening of raw material prices, efficient sourcing, and a favorable product mix. As raw material prices stabilize, the gross margin is expected to return to normal levels. The management has given guidance for the EBITDA margin to be in the range of 18-20%. Although sharp input cost reductions could lead to healthy earnings growth, APNT’s valuations are fair at 62.3xFY24E and 54.5xFY25E EPS.

Outlook

We retain our Neutral rating with a TP of INR3,120 (based on 50xFY25E EPS).

Sharekhan's research report on Asian Paints

APL’s Q1FY24 numbers were a mixed bag with consolidated revenues growing 7% y-o-y to Rs. 9,182.3 crore, while an over 500 bps rise in OPM drove up PAT by 46% y-o-y to Rs. 1,519.4 crore. Decorative paint volume grew by 10% in Q1. Management expects volume to growth to be higher in H2FY24 due to extended festive season. Real estate and project demand remains good. OPM came at 23.1% in Q1FY24. Management maintained its guidance of 18-20% OPM for FY2024. Any significant increase in crude prices would act as a risk to margins.

Outlook

We downgrade Asian Paints Ltd (APL) to Hold with revised PT of Rs. 3,675, given a limited upside and heightened competitive pressures from new entrants. Stock trades at 60.8x and 51.8x its FY2024E/25E EPS.

Asian Paints is looking to expand its presence in the luxury paint segment, the company told analysts in the post-earnings call. The luxury paint segment is presently dominated by rivals such as Kansai Nerolac Paints and Akzo Nobel.

In the June quarter, the economy and premium segments did well, but Asian Paints' luxury portfolio underperformed. To address this, the management is looking at improvisation and innovation its existing luxury offerings.

The management believes that Niyala has the potential to establish Asian Paints in the super luxury paint segment, said the company on its Q1FY24 earnings conference call.

We have seen an uptrend for the fourth straight session, but there was selling pressure at higher levels as the Nifty50 could not sustain above the 19,800 mark on a closing basis on July 18. This indicates there can be a possible consolidation or minor correction in the coming days especially due to the recent upward rally after a breakout of the 19,500-19,300 range on the higher side. Even the volatility also increased for yet another session, with the India VIX moving towards the 12 mark.

The BSE Sensex rose more than 200 points to 66,795, while the Nifty50 climbed 38 points to 19,749 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts as the closing was lower than opening levels but there was a continuation of higher tops, higher bottoms formation.

The broader markets underperformed frontliners as the market breadth was weak with a 2:3 ratio. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices were down 0.14 percent and 0.94 percent respectively.

Bank Nifty hit a new high of 45,906 intraday but turned volatile amid profit booking later part of the session, and finally settled with minor losses of 39 points at 45,411, while the Nifty IT was the star performer, climbing 330 points to 31,371.

Stocks that performed better than broader markets included Infosys, Asian Paints, and Birlasoft. Infosys was the top gainer in the Nifty50, rising 3.7 percent to Rs 1,475, the highest closing level since March 9 and formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with healthy volumes. Further, the stock has sustained above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) for the third straight day.

Asian Paints, which remained in an upward rally since April, rose 1.5 percent to settle at Rs 3,513, the highest closing level since September 28 last year and is a few rupees away from its all-time high of Rs 3,590 on January 10 last year. The stock has formed a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily scale with above-average volumes and maintained higher highs, higher lows formation for six days in a row.

Birlasoft sustained an uptrend with higher volumes for the fourth consecutive session, rising over 2 percent to Rs 392 on Tuesday, the highest closing level since May 6 last year. The stock has formed a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, with staying above 50-day as well as 200-day EMAs.

Here's what Viraj Vyas of Ashika Stock Broking recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Infosys

Infosys has seen a strong rally from April's lows of Rs 1,200. However, on a broader time frame, the stock is still undergoing time and price correction.

It is currently approaching a resistance area formed by recent swing highs. If the stock can break above Rs 1,480-1,500 zone on a weekly basis, it could signal further bullish momentum for the stock.

Asian Paints

Asian Paints has been consolidating since September 2021, correcting over time. Recently, it found support at the swing low and rebounded strongly, reaching the upper threshold of the consolidation.

The weekly chart shows a breakthrough above resistance at Rs 3,400-3,440, indicating renewed bullish momentum. The stock is poised to target Rs 4,000-4,100 zone, with critical support at Rs 3,375.

Birlasoft

Birlasoft has been establishing a solid foundation within Rs 340-260 range for approximately a year. Recently, the stock successfully breached the Rs 340-level with increased trading volumes.

Notably, it has exhibited higher highs and higher lows on daily charts, suggesting a possible trend reversal. If the stock sustains above Rs 370, there is a strong probability of it advancing towards Rs 440-450 levels in the forthcoming weeks.

Input costs for paint manufacturing companies are likely to move higher as oil prices are on the rise amid a tight supply and expectations of an end to rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.

Brent crude futures hit a three-month high of $81.57 per barrel in the previous session on the back of concerns over tight supply due to issues in Libya and Nigeria along with hopes that the US Fed may bring an end to its rate hike campaign following the softer-than-expected US retail inflation print for June. In addition, a fall in US dollar also aided sentiment as it bodes well with non-US dominated purchasers.

Furthermore, Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two largest oil exporters, have recently decided to further cut their existing oil production that have been in effect since November of the previous year. On the back of the following, Brent crude futures have climbed 8 percent in July so far.

Production for paint heavily relies on crude-based derivatives which are used as raw materials and likewise, their cost of manufacturing is directly impacted by the price of crude. The dependence of paint companies on crude oil derivatives is such that it accounts for about 40 percent of their overall raw materials as pointed by analysts.

When crude prices rise, it also lifts the input costs for paints companies, putting a pressure on their profit margins. Hence, a rise in oil prices is works negatively for paint manufacturers.

Meanwhile, most brokerages are anticipating a margin recovery for paint companies in the April-June quarter on the back of an easing in input costs during the period. However, that recovery may soon take a U-turn in the upcoming quarters if prices of oil, a key raw material for decorative paints (a segment which brings in high-margins) continue to remain on the upmove.

Moreover, the paint industry is already struggling with concerns of increasing competition with the foray of big players like Grasim. In addition, a slow uptake in rural demand is also likely to dent sentiment for the sector.

Global broking and research firm Jefferies also tagged Grasim Industries' investment plans of Rs 10,000 crore for its foray into the paint segment as the ""Jio moment"" for the industry in recent report. The report suggests that the industry is likely to experience substantial upheaval with the entry of Grasim's paint brands.

When put together, the aforementioned headwinds can dent the medium-term growth outlook for paint companies. A reflection of these concerns is also seen in the recent stock performance of paint companies. Shares of Asian Paints, Berger Paints India, Shalimar Paints, Kansai Nerolac Paints and Indigo Paints have given returns of -2 to 4 percent in the past months, even as the market soared to new all-time highs.

Shares of paint companies traded 1 to 3 percent higher in the early trade on June 13 as Brent crude futures tanked to their lowest since December 2021.

As paint production heavily relies on petroleum-based raw materials, the cost of manufacturing paint is directly linked to the price of crude. When crude falls, the manufacturing costs for paints drop, increasing the profit margins of paint manufacturers. A decline in oil prices is positive for paint manufacturers.

On June 12, Brent crude futures dropped nearly $3 a barrel or around 4 percent to settle at $71.84 after analysts pointed out the increase in global oil supplies and expressed concerns about weak demand. The drop coincides with the release of crucial inflation data and the upcoming meeting of the Federal Reserve on June 14.

At 9.58 am, shares of Asian Paints were up 2.22 percent at Rs 3,265.55 on the NSE. Berger Paints, Kansai Nerolac Paints, Indigo Paints and Akzo Nobel were also trading 1-3 percent higher.

Recently, Goldman Sachs revised its projection for the price of Brent crude for December, reducing it by nearly 10 percent to $86. The decision was based on its observation of an increase in oil supply and a decrease in demand as a result of sluggish economic growth.

Brent crude serves as the benchmark for approximately two-thirds of the global oil market.

Expectations of lower oil prices are also likely to help ease margin pressures for paint companies, aiding their financials.

Grasim, an Aditya Birla group company that has announced its foray into paint manufacturing, is beta testing its painting service 'Sparkle' in Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru. Initially, it will cater exclusively to the staff of the Aditya Birla group and their friends and family, a recent report by Jefferies has said.

As Grasim is yet to commission its own manufacturing, the Sparkle

painting service is not using its own brand at this stage. It uses paint products procured from authorised dealers of respective paint companies.

In case of any product complaints, customers will be directed to the respective paint companies for warranty-related claims. However, Sparkle will assist in the warranty registration process, as stated in the Jefferies report.

In addition to the Sparkle painting service, Grasim's subsidiary, UltraTech Cement, introduced a white-cement-based liquid primer named Birla White PrimaCoat in 2022. The company claims that this primer offers superior adhesion and higher coverage compared to acrylic wall primers available in the market.

The verdict

Jefferies' analyst Vivek Maheshwari believes that it will be an uphill task for

Grasim to grab a large market share and that smaller players may be impacted, while Asian Paints will remain unscathed.

""While success is not guaranteed, the sheer magnitude of the Rs 10,000 crore capex investment by Grasim will likely push the new competitor to adopt an aggressive stance to ramp up,"" he said.

Higher discounts, promotions for dealers and even painters could impact the industry's profitability, at least in the medium term, he added.

Grasim is set to launch its paints early in 2024 with 1,332 million litres per annum (MLPA) total capacity. To counter it, Asian Paints’ has also been ramping up its capacity, which will reach 2,636 MLPA in few years.

At 11.30 am on June 2, Asian Paints was quoting flat at Rs 3,241.75 on the NSE. Grasim was also trading flat at Rs 1,705.30.",326,-0.23516526222229003

Motilal Oswal's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints (APNT) reported strong volume growth of ~16% in 4QFY23 (est. 6%) and ~14% in FY23. The management also indicated that all the segments, i.e., economy, premium and luxury, grew in double digits, with both urban and rural markets performing well. Improvement in gross margin was led by a softening in raw material prices (deflated ~4% YoY), sourcing efficiencies and a decent product mix. With raw material prices being more or less stable, we expect gross margin to be at normative levels. The management has guided for EBITDA margin in the range of 18-20%.

Outlook

Although sharp input cost reductions could lead to healthy earnings growth, APNT’s valuations are fair at 57.8xFY24E and 50.3xFY25E EPS. We retain our Neutral rating with a TP of INR3,120 (based on 50xFY25E EPS).

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian Paints

We upgrade our FY24/25 EPS by 7.1%/1.0% given 1) strong demand outlook (16% volumes during 4Q23) and 2) 122/18bps higher EBITDA margins in FY24/25 given benign RM outlook and stable product pricing. Input costs are showing 4% QoQ deflation although TiO2 prices are moving up. 4Q saw a sharp 256bps QoQ ETBIDA margin recovery to 21.2% supported by 393bps QoQ gross margin improvement with stable mix. We believe APNT might pass on benefits of lower RM costs to consumers in medium term to push volumes and improve market competitiveness. Long term growth levers are intact led by 1) market share gains in decorative paints 2) sustained increase in distribution (addition of 15-20k/10-15k retail touch points in FY23/24) 3) innovations & focus on high growth waterproofing/wood finishes segment 4) scalability plans in home décor from 4-5% to 8-10% by FY26 (both organic and inorganic) 4) market leadership in retail segment of waterproofing & increased focus in project business 5) sustained growth and sharp improvement in profitability in industrial paint JV’s.



Outlook

We see little scope of further re-rating given likely aggression from Grasim & JSW in Paints and impending capex plans. We value stock on DCF and assign target price of Rs3360 (Rs3160 earlier). We expect back ended returns given emerging competition and valuations of 51.1xFY25. Accumulate for long term gains only.

Asian Paints was down almost a percent in the morning trade on May 12, a day after putting out a better-than-expected set of numbers for the March quarter, which, however, got a mixed reaction from brokerages who are concerned about growing competition in the sector.

The paint maker’s year-on-year (YoY) net profit was 44 percent higher at Rs 1,258 crore against an estimate of Rs 1,160 crore.

Revenue came in at Rs 8,787 crore, also higher than expectations of Rs 8,600 crore, the company said on May 11. Asian Paints' operating margin at 21.2 percent was 180 basis points higher than the forecast, thanks to easing raw material prices.

The biggest beat was on the volume growth front. Volume growth at 16 percent was the highest in three quarters, while analysts were expecting the number at 7-10 percent.

Despite these numbers, brokerages have a mixed outlook on the stock.

Macquarie has given an “outperform” call with a target price of Rs 3,700 a share, citing the company's sector-leading sales performance and healthy demand supporting the company's confidence on FY24 sales.

In contrast, Jefferies has “underperform” call with a target price of Rs 2,500, expressing concerns about looming competition risk despite the impressive double-digit volume growth.

Competition heating up

With a capex of Rs 10,000 crore and a capacity of 1.3 billion litres, Grasim plans to launch its products in 2024. That's when analysts expect market share competition to play out aggressively.

Asian Paints is also not taking things lightly. It has already announced over Rs 8,700 crore of capex to pump up its manufacturing capacity to almost 2.3 billion litres.

While the management is aggressive, analysts believe this can affect return ratios and free cash flows in the near term.

""While improving margins would lead to better ROCE, new capex plans might dilute it. The stock remains expensive at ~57.8x FY24E earnings per share,"" Motilal Oswal Financial Services’ analysts have said.

Morgan Stanley also has an “underweight” call on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,546 a share. The management's aggressive pursuit of growth is viewed as a positive factor, but the retention of the 18-20 percent operating margin guidance is seen as a limitation, its analysts said.

At 9.21 am the stock was down 0.92 percent at Rs 3,111 on the National Stock Exchange.

Asian Paints on May 11 reported consolidated net profit of Rs 1,234.14 crore in the March quarter of FY23, a growth of 45.12 percent from Rs 850.42 crore in the year-ago period.

The company's revenue from operations came in at Rs 8,787.34 crore, rising 11.33 percent over Rs 7,892.67 crore in the year-ago quarter.

The board recommended payment of the final dividend of Rs 21.25 per equity share for the financial year FY23, subject to approval of the shareholders.

In this quarter we have logged in the highest value ever, with the decorative and non-automotive Industrial businesses registering double digit volume and value growths,"" said Amit Syngle, Managing Director & CEO of Asian Paints Limited.

Sequentially, the company said, Q4 standalone and consolidated PBDIT margin increased by 300 bps and 260 bps respectively, compared to Q3.

""We have been able to improve our margins in the quarter sequentially and over last year through our persistent work on formulation and sourcing efficiencies and also helped by the easing inflation in raw material prices. In Home décor, our new categories of fabrics, decorative lighting, UPVC doors and windows did well, while Kitchen and bath were sluggish.

Asian Paints is expected to report 21 percent jump in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,166 crore on strong volumes. Top line is expected to grow 10 percent to Rs 8,665 crore, as per the average of estimates of brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.

The company is scheduled to announce its Q4 results during market hours on May 11.

On the operating front, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins are seen expanding over 100 basis point on-year and 75 basis points sequentially to 19.4 percent.

""Raw material prices have continued to soften and gross margins should inch up. Gross margin expansion, along with operating leverage and cost efficiencies to support Ebitda margins,"" according to Jefferies.

The price of titanium dioxide, a key input for paint companies, has fallen 10 percent year-on-year. The price of crude oil is proportionally related to the cost of paint manufacturing. In the base quarter of Q4 FY22, crude prices were above the $90 per barrel mark.

Analyst expectations on the volume growth vary from 7 percent to 12 percent. Jefferies expects volume growth of 12 percent and a price/mix decline of 2 percent. Meanwhile, Kotak Institutional Equities expects volume growth of 7 percent.

In this context, it is important to watch for management commentary on mix change and demand outlook in rural markets.

""We gather that the March quarter started off on a strong note (on a soft base), but demand moderated towards the end of the quarter (perhaps, on a high base). A steep 15 percent price hike in Q3 last year had led to some shift of sales to Q4 FY22,"" noted Kotak Institutional Equities.

Another key factor to monitor will be the commentary on home décor, bath and kitchen businesses. The company had witnessed some slowdown in these segments in the quarter gone by.

Investors will also be eyeing the progress on capex plans. The company earlier announced Rs 8,750-crore capex for setting up facilities for Vinyl Acetate Ethylene Emulsion (VAE) and Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) in India, acquiring a nano-technology player and increasing the manufacturing capacity to 22.7 lakh KL.

New entrant Grasim could give India’s paint giant Asian Paints the blues. Competition from Grasim is set to emerge in just 12 months, which clouds the medium-term growth outlook for Asian Paints, financial services firm Jefferies has said. It has an “underperform” rating on the stock with the target set at Rs 2,500 a share.

At 2 pm, Asian Paints was quoting at Rs 2,792.55 on the National Stock Exchange, down 1.6 percent from the previous close. It was among the top losers on the Nifty and the Sensex.

""Any potential tailwind from input price deflation is an opportunity to sell,"" said Jefferies in its report.

The company will see better margin trends in Q4 as high-cost inventory gets exhausted. Jefferies estimates gross margins to inch up to >40 percent in the next quarter.

In Q3 FY23, the company reported a 6.37 percent growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,097.06 crore. Consolidated revenue from operations came in at Rs 8,636.74 crore, up only 1.28 percent from Rs 8,527.24 crore in the year-ago quarter.

After earning a reputation of being a quality-focused fund manager, Saurabh Mukherjea has launched a quant-based fund that will blend both quality and value. Called MeritorQ, the fund relies more on historical numerical data than forward-looking, qualitative calls, a marked departure from his stated investment philosophy thus far of investing in companies with proven management that generates strong free cash flows.

Founded in 2018, Mukherjea’s fund house Marcellus Investment Managers has been super successful in terms of gathering assets and is currently one of the biggest PMS fund houses in the country with assets under management of Rs 25,535 crore.

In terms of performance, Marcellus’ funds Consistent Compounders and Little Champs have given 9.3 percent and 16.4 percent CAGR return over the last three years, versus a 23.75 percent return for the Nifty 50 and 31.03 percent for the Nifty Midcap index. Over the past three months, they have bled 11 percent. Moneycontrol talked to Mukherjea, and Krishnan VR, the fund manager of MeritorQ.

Edited excerpts:

How are the parameters set for MeritorQ different from the parameters set by Marcellus for its other funds?

In MeritorQ, we look for companies with clean accounts, low leverage, and consistent profitability. These are some of the parameters we consider for other Marcellus products as well. MeritorQ’s selection criteria favour companies that generate high returns on capital and are currently undervalued basis of P/FCF, that is price-to-free cash flow ratio. In our other funds, we look at ascertaining the longevity of a company’s business and cash flow generation by doing in-depth, bottom-up research on the company’s distinctive capabilities, management quality and governance.

Which sectors is MeritorQ overweight on?

Materials (cement, fertiliser and chemicals), consumer staples and information technology have the highest sectoral weightage in the current portfolio. Top holdings include EID Parry, Gujarat State Petronet, Coromandel International and Heidelberg Cement.

The framework throws up the consumer and IT sectors because they usually have a higher proportion of companies that are both profitable as well as undervalued when compared to their free cash flow generating ability.

Also, we screen out highly levered and cyclical companies in the screening step itself. So one will notice a lower proportion of energy or other commodity companies in the final portfolio.

Finally, our forensic screen penalises sectors with a higher incidence of poor accounting quality like real estate and industrials, as a result, these sectors tend to also get a lower allocation in MeritorQ.

You have said that the fund combines uncorrelated factors, can you elaborate?

Because we pick companies that are both profitable as well as undervalued in MeritorQ, one can think of the strategy as combining quality and value factors. Quality and value factors returns have typically seen a lower correlation in India and in other major markets as well. In fact, we have found monthly excess returns of Nifty 500 Value 50 and Nifty 200 Quality 30 indices, which can be thought to represent long-only value and quality factors in India, to be negatively correlated from July-2006 to September 2022.

One reason for this negative or low correlation is that value approaches typically outperform when the economy is coming out of recession while quality does well during the recessions as these typically tend to be stronger, profitable and hence more resilient businesses. The benefit of combining uncorrelated approaches like selecting value and quality is it helps in delivering better risk-adjusted returns, across the entire economic cycle.

What are the risks associated with quant-based investing?

A frequent criticism of quant investing approaches is that they rely on the black box or complex models where it is difficult to explain how the final portfolio was arrived at. Many quant models might also employ leverage either explicitly or implicitly by using derivatives. The quant meltdown of 2007 and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998 are classic examples of how such risks can destroy investor wealth.

We employ a systematic and transparent approach to portfolio construction. The rules are based on good investing principles and are designed to address risks specific to investing in Indian companies. No leverage or derivatives are employed in MeritorQ. Historical backtest performance is one of the data points we consider for deciding the rules in MeritorQ along with the robustness of the process and analysis of the portfolio holdings, among others.

Since quant funds rely on historical data to pick stocks, how do you address an investor's forward-looking market appetite?

Forward-looking data is inherently based on judgement, which may or may not be correct and if it is a consensus forward-looking view then there is no opportunity to make money either. MeritorQ uses historical but factual data and applies the rules on this factual data repeatedly in a disciplined fashion over a wide investment universe to increase the odds of outperformance.

In fact, Brent fell below the $75 per barrel mark for the first time since December 2021.

As per analysts’ calculations, nearly 40-45 percent of raw materials used by paint companies are crude oil derivatives. This makes for 30-35 percent of the total raw material cost. Thus, a fall in crude prices will ease margin pressures for the companies.

“Currently, the paint stocks are trading below their long-term valuation, which provides a bargain opportunity to the investors as the story remains intact,” Antu Thomas, research analyst at Geojit Financial Services said.

As ironical as it may seem, a larger market share by Grasim in the decorative paints industry might be good news for incumbents like Asian Paints and Berger Paints – currently sitting on 75 percent of the pie.

If Grasim grabs a 20 percent market share by FY30, then the industry’s operating margins will contract by only 150 basis points. Compared to that, a 5 percent market share can shave off 400 basis points from margins.

The pricing math

This is as per the calculations done by analysts at ICICI Securities.

“If Grasim gains market share aggressively, then incumbents will do limited pricing actions in products and regions where Grasim is gaining share,” according to analysts Manoj Menon and Aniruddha Joshi.

Existing players may increase advertising spends and trade schemes but that will impact margins by only 150 basis points, they believe.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

On the other hand, if Grasim manages to grab only a 5 percent market share then it may resort to aggressive pricing actions to gain more. In that case, existing players will also do the same to retain their market share.

“Retaining market share will become critical versus margins. While the MNCs (Akzo and Kansai) will be last to engage in a price war, we believe market leader Asian Paints and Berger may resort to aggressive pricing immediately,” as per the analysts at ICICI Securities.

Thus, operating margins are expected to come down by 400 basis points.

Currently, the industry’s operating margins stand at 15-18 percent. In the first scenario of Grasim grabbing a 20 percent share, the EBITDA of the top five players is estimated to be Rs 10,868 crore by FY30, as per ICICI Sec’s calculations. Meanwhile in the second scenario of it getting a 5 percent market share, while revenue growth will be comparatively faster, the EBITDA of the top five players is estimated to be lower at Rs 10,699 crore by FY30.

The ratings

ICICI Securities has downgraded Asian Paints, Kansai Nerolac and Indigo Paints to ‘Reduce’ from ‘Hold’ with targets of Rs 2,650, Rs 385 and Rs 980 respectively. It has a 'Reduce' rating on Berger Paints with a target price of Rs 505.

Contrary to ICICI Securities’ belief, financial services firm Macquarie says that Asian Paints’ brand pull is enough to offset any pricing competition. It has an 'Outperform' rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 3,600 apiece.

According to Macquarie’s calculation, Grasim’s Rs 10,000 crore paint capex will be divided as follows: Rs 300- 400 crore on working capital, Rs 300-400 crore on a tinting machine, and the rest on branding and ad spends.

This is contrary to Street’s assumption of the entire capex being used for plant additions.

How much progress has Grasim made?

The company will launch its paints by Q4 of FY24, with six manufacturing plants in Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and West Bengal. Total capacity will be 1,332 MLPA (million litres per annum), which is about 70 percent of market leader Asian Paints' current capacity.

The stock, however, has not done much in the past two years. It did hit an all-time high in September 2022 but it has been trading in the range of Rs 2,800-Rs 3,500 over the past two years.

In Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker, the stock has consistently featured in the Maximum Pessimism list. It has 15 ""buy"" calls, 11 ""hold: and 12 ""sell"" calls. Back in March 2019, in the pre-COVID era, it had 25 ""buy"" calls, eight ""hold"" and only one ""sell"" call.

The prevailing sentiment is that Asian Paints’ moat and market share are now in danger. According to analysts, here are some of the reasons:

Competition

Ever since Grasim announced its entry into the paints segment with Rs 10,000 crore capex and 1,332 MLPA (million litres per annum) total capacity, D-Street has been playing it safe on Asian Paints. Asian Paints’ current capacity stands at 1,700 MLPA.

A number of other smaller players like JSW Paints and JK Paints are also ramping up their capacity. JSW Paints’ All Color, One Price strategy has also caught the eye.

With this, the fight for shelf space will intensify and eventually eat into Asian Paints 50-plus percent market share in the organised decorative segment.

Heavy capex, ROE worries

For Saurabh Mukherjea, whose Marcellus Investments fund is heavily invested in the company, competition is not a worry. “Making it big in the paint industry is not easy. Shalimar Paints and Sherwin-Williams Paints have failed to make a mark,” he said in an earlier interview to Moneycontrol.

But Asian Paints’ management is surely on the offensive. In two back-to-back capex announcements amounting to about Rs 8,700 crore, the paints manufacturer is now aiming for 2,670 MLPA capacity in the next few years. This includes backward integration of vinyl acetate plants, acquisitions and a new water-based paint manufacturing facility.

According to analysts at HDFC Securities, this investment phase will be a drain on free cash flows and returns profile in the short to medium term. Analysts at ICICI Securities agree. They have pegged ROE (return on equity) at 27.5 percent for FY23, 27.7 percent for FY24 and 25.3 percent for FY25.

Also Read: Analyst Call tracker: Why has Bajaj Auto remained a street favourite this quarter despite export pressures?

Volume and valuations

In Q3FY23, the company reported no growth in volumes. In the September quarter, volume growth was 11 percent, preceded by 38 percent in Q1FY23 and 8 percent in Q4FY22. Three-year volume compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is 16.2 percent, taking into account the pent-up demand after COVID-lockdowns.

As per foreign brokerage JPMorgan, “A severe consumption slowdown could pose downside risks to volumes and, hence, earnings growth assumptions. Aggressive price/promotion-based competition is also a key risk for the company.”

The firm expects the medium-term margin to stay capped at 19-20 percent amid product mix changes, elevated crude price and higher investments in new adjacencies.

Due to these factors, analysts believe there is little scope for re-rating of the stock, which is trading at 73x price-to-earnings ratio. The consensus 12-month target price on the stock is Rs 3,052.74, which is only 6.5 percent higher than the current market price.

Bulls kept the markets charged up for the second straight session but there was pressure at the higher levels which drove the benchmark indices off the day's high at the close on March 6.

This may be indicating that the healthy strength is yet get build up, though we have a two-day rally. The index has formed small bodied bullish candle with long upper shadow which resembles the shooting star kind of a pattern on the daily charts, which is a bearish reversal pattern.

The Nifty almost hit 17,800 but failed to hold on to the same, and closed at 17,711 with 117 points gain with above average volumes for the second day in a row. In the current month so far, the index gained more than 400 points from nearly four-and-a-half-month lows.

Going ahead, 17,800 is expected to be crucial resistance area as closing above this may take the index towards the psychological 18,000 mark, with crucial support area at 17,350-17,400 in the coming sessions, experts said.

""The Nifty tested the 200-DMA (17,413) multiple times and has managed to defend this crucial support point. On the weekly charts, it has kept its head above the 50-week MA (moving average) which is at 17,345,"" Foram Chheda, Technical Research Analyst and Founder of ChartAnalytics.co.in, said.

Over the coming weeks, she feels the Nifty is likely to stay largely rangebound in 17,350-18,000 range. While any runaway up move is unlikely, as long as the index does not take out 18000 levels convincingly, it has support in the zone of 17,350-17,400 levels, she said.

While the markets may continue to oscillate in this broad, but defined range and runaway up moves seen as unlikely, one will also need to keep a vigilant eye on India VIX which is at one of its lowest levels (12.26) seen since July 2021, she advised.

India VIX, the fear index fell significantly from its recent high of 16 levels on February 23 to 12.26 levels, giving the comfort for bulls.

""The Option data broadly indicated that the Nifty50 may remain in a range of 17,400-17,850,"" Shivangi Sarda, Senior Executive Analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said.

On the weekly Call side, there is maximum open interest at 17,800 strike followed by 18,000 strike with writing at 17,800 strike and then 17,950 strike, whereas on the Put side, there is maximum open interest at 17,500 strike followed by 17,600 strike, with writing at 17,700 strike and then 17,600 strike.

Foram Chheda, Technical Research Analyst and Founder of ChartAnalytics.co.in

Oberoi Realty: Buy | LTP: Rs 885 | Stop-Loss: Rs 827 | Target: Rs 970 | Return: 9.6 percent

Oberoi Realty seems to be breaking out from a bullish Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern which emerged following a corrective move. The stock has crossed above the 200-DMA (daily moving average) which stands at Rs 876 and this DMA was almost acting as a proxy neckline for this formation.

The MACD (moving average convergence divergence) stays in continuing buy mode. While the stock was within this formation, OBV (on-balance volume) was rising; this indicated positive accumulation in the stock.

While the stock remains inside the leading quadrant of the RRG (relative rotation graphs); it has seen quadrant crossover on the higher time frame charts. RS (relative strength) line has changed its trajectory and seems moving higher while crossing above the 50-period MA (moving average).

Coal India: Buy | LTP: Rs 225 | Stop-Loss: Rs 216 | Target: Rs 248 | Return: 10.2 percent

Coal India's primary uptrend was interrupted in November last year at Rs 242; after that, the stock traded in a defined range between Rs 200-240 levels. The recent price move shows the stock trying to break out from an area pattern; it seems to be penetrating the falling trendline that begins from Rs 224-225 levels and joined the subsequent lower tops.

Signals on the charts indicate that the stock is in for a resumption of an uptrend. RSI (relative strength index) has already staged a breakout from a formation ahead of the price breakout which is bullish.

The stock is inside the leading quadrant of the RRG; it may relatively outperform the broader markets. RS line is in an uptrend; remains above the 50-Period MA.

Tata Chemicals: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,002 | Stop-Loss: Rs 966 | Target: Rs 1,060 | Return: 6 percent

The price action in Tata Chemicals over the past several weeks has developed a Symmetrical Triangle pattern. Although this is a neutral pattern and can resolve with the price moving in either direction, one can reasonably anticipate the possible directional bias with the support of other pieces of evidence on the chart.

A narrowing Histogram shows MACD on the verge of a positive crossover. The stock is inside the weakening quadrant; however, the improvement in its Relative Momentum against the broader Nifty500 index shows resilience in the technical setup.

On the weekly timeframe, Tata Chemicals has seen a quadrant crossover on RRG. The RS line has reversed its trajectory and it is seen moving higher.

Nifty50 opened the session on March 2 on a tepid note and witnessed selling pressure throughout the session to close the weekly expiry around the day's lows. However, the index had rebounded strongly on Wednesday, post forming, the red candles for consecutive nine sessions in a row. The reversal was witnessed after hitting the potential reversal zone (PRZ) of the AB=CD Harmonic pattern which stands around the 17,300-17,250 zone.

Hence, going ahead till the index manages to protect 17,200 mark, index is expected to perceive an oversold bounce towards 17,630, followed by 17,800.

Failure to hold 17,200 would invalidate the Harmonic pattern and shall signal the continuation of the down-move. In this case, the decline shall extend towards 17,030-16,880 levels.

This year, in late January, price rebounded higher finding support around lower band of the mentioned range with supportive momentum and volumes. Price trading above all key moving averages (20, 50, 100, 200-day) highlights strength in trend.

The weapons of choice? Advertising and promotion (A&P) spends. But as they launch their campaigns, FMCG companies must also navigate the fine balance of the need to promote products and maintain market share, with their obligation to maintain margins and return value to shareholders.

Going by the trend seen in the third quarter of financial year 2022-23 (Q3 FY23), FMCG companies have spent more on advertising compared to the previous quarter, but it is lower on year-on-year (YoY) basis as well as pre-COVID levels. In Q3, companies spent a little over 8 percent of their revenue on ads, compared to 9 percent in Q3 FY22 and 10.5 percent in Q3 FY20 (pre-COVID).

Market leader Hindustan Unilever, which is the biggest spender on ads, shelled out 8 percent of its revenue on A&P costs for the December quarter. This is higher than the 7 percent spend of the September quarter, but lower than the 11.5 percent outgo in the pre-COVID time.

""Ad spends by fast-moving consumer goods companies are inching back to pre-COVID levels. With learnings from the pandemic-phase marketing, companies are now employing newer and innovative ATL (above the line) and BTL (below the line) mediums to engage consumers,” Sameer Shah, Chief Financial Officer, Godrej Consumer Products, said.

ATL marketing is used when print, television or any other mass media is deployed, while BTL spends allow marketers to tailor their message in a personal manner.

For instance, Godrej Consumer had set up fragrance zones for Aer Matic in Durga Pujo pandals of Kolkata, Mumbai and Delhi. On the other hand, Emami made the direct consumer connect for its Vedic oil by samplings in fairs and festivals.

“It’s crucial to involve customers in on-ground activities like exhibitions, village fairs, food expos and RWA (Resident Welfare Association) activities,” said Rakhee Yadav, Senior Marketing Manager, Pansari Group – a New Delhi-based food products company.

Getting back volumes

According to the report released by data analytics firm NielsenIQ, in October-December, the FMCG industry grew 7.6 percent in terms of value but urban volumes grew 1.6 percent YoY while rural volumes declined 2.8 percent. Some consumers have downtraded to lower unit packs and others to unbranded regional alternatives, analysts said.

Historically, growth in rural markets has always outpaced growth in urban markets when it comes to staples. With rural India constituting about 36 percent of the sales pie for a typical consumer company, the industry is fighting to get back volumes, which has been on a downward trend for over a year now.

“The expectation was that inflation will subside by the end of the year, demand pressures will ease, and FMCG companies will start seeing volume growth. Since that has not played out exactly, A&P spends will have to be done judiciously, with increased focus on BTL activities,” said Shirish Pardeshi of Centrum Broking.

Foreign brokerage firm Jefferies also noted that the focus has shifted to consumer/trade promotions versus ATL brand advertising, given a weak demand environment and high inflation.

As FMCG companies explore new and innovative ways to engage with consumers and win back volumes, only time will tell how effective their A&P spends will be.",560,-0.9831693887710571
2023-02-22 06:34:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-indias-consumption-story-10135991.html,"“People are buying luxury cars but not chappals and underwear.” The joke was everywhere on Twitter recently. But, jokes apart, it shows the grim reality of India’s ""K-shaped"" recovery.

A K-shaped recovery occurs when different parts of the economy recover at different rates, times, or magnitudes. Though SBI’s economists dismissed the 'K-shaped recovery' critique in a report in January, the Q3 earnings trend flies in the face of that view.

Here’s how India’s consumption story is panning out:

FMCG staples

This segment is a true indicator of a country’s economic health. In India, revenue for the FMCG pack has been on an upward trajectory due to the price hikes to mitigate raw material inflation. But this has come at the cost of volumes.

Rural India constitutes about 36 percent of the sales pie for a typical consumer company and this segment has been reeling under inflationary pressure. So much so, that Nestle India reported a loss in volumes for its Maggi Chotu pack, which costs Rs 7. Except for biscuits, demand in all other FMCG segments has taken a hit.

While Hindustan Unilever’s Sanjiv Mehta said that he has been seeing “green shoots” in rural demand, there is still a long way to go. According to the report released by data analytics firm NielsenIQ, in October-December, the industry grew 7.6 percent in terms of value but urban volumes grew 1.6 percent year-on-year while rural volumes declined 2.8 percent. Some consumers have down traded to lower unit packs and others to unbranded regional alternatives, analysts noted.

Encouraging winter crop sowing and indications of higher farm income came as good news for the industry but now fears of a subdued monsoon due to El Nino pose a new challenge for the industry.

Consumer discretionary and QSR

“The slowdown in discretionary spends is visible” Not our words. That’s what Uday Kotak said. Be it Asian Paints, Havells or Domino’s operator Jubilant FoodWorks, most discretionary companies have taken a hit on their bottomline as inflation has burned a hole in the low-to-mid income Indian’s pocket.

In Q3, Asian Paints and Pidilite both posted volume growth that was little changed against expectations of 4-5 percent growth. Both flagged demand stress in the rural and semi-urban areas. Electrical consumer goods company Havells reported a 7.2 percent fall in quarterly profit, citing “moderating” consumer demand. Whirlpool India also flagged similar concerns in its earnings statement.

Same-store sales growth for quick-service restaurants came in below Street expectations. Analysts believe startup layoffs and the slowdown in IT hiring are impacting spending and sentiment, with the fast-food category also witnessing down trading now. Though the festive season was a good time for the entire discretionary space, the slowdown that has crept in since shows no signs of a turnaround.

Retail

Nykaa’s top boss Falguni Nayar said lower consumer spending impacted the beauty-tech platform’s margin and revenue. It reported a 94 basis points margin contraction in Q3.

Page Industries, which is the exclusive licensee of Jockey, also cautioned that demand is not as buoyant in the ongoing quarter. “We are not seeing any recovery in the market,” managing director VS Ganesh said in a recent earnings call.

Avenue Supermarts’ earnings also disappointed as the higher-margin general merchandise and apparel segments underperformed the FMCG and staples segments. “Discretionary non-FMCG sales did not do as well as expected in this quarter,” said Neville Noronha, CEO & managing director, Avenue Supermarts Limited.

Footwear retailer Relaxo’s Q3 was no different from the industry. Revenue from operations fell 8 percent on-year weighed down by subdued demand in mass segment articles. It also lost market share to unorganised players. On the flip side, luxury shoemakers such as Metro Brands have emerged stronger.

That brings us to the other end of the spectrum.

Hotels and tourism

The hotels and tourism sector is the brightest beacon in the gloomy consumption story. Ever since the pandemic ebbed, the sector has been a major beneficiary of the recovery. In November 2022, the Indian hotel industry recorded its best performance since the pandemic began, with occupancy at 68-70 percent and average rates exceeding Rs 7,000.

The third quarter, which is a seasonally strong quarter thanks to a number of festivals, was strong for hotel companies as they saw sharp jumps in revenue and margins. The management of hotel companies is bullish on the near future as well.

“The outlook is very strong, albeit it is all built mostly on domestic (tourism) because foreign inbound is still lagging behind 2019-20 numbers,” said Puneet Chhatwal, Managing Director & CEO, Indian Hotels, in the chain’s recent analyst call.

He added that there are a lot of events happening this year, “including G20 and the Cricket World Cup, which should further boost demand or provide the necessary buffer should there be any form of headwinds coming from anywhere”.

Analysts concur. In a note, HDFC Securities said that with demand outpacing supply, which the latter is unlikely to catch up with over the next 2-3 years, it expects both average room rates (ARRs) and occupancy to remain strong, leading to higher RevPar for the industry.

Automobiles

Another silver lining in the consumption bucket has been automobiles, especially electric vehicles and sports utility vehicles (SUV). The sector has seen strong growth led by a number of model launches in the mid- to high-end segments.

For some models, such as the Mahindra Scorpio N, Tata Nexon, Maruti Suzuki Brezza and Hyundai Creta, the order backlog is as high as 12 months. The demand is such that the 5-door Jimmy, which Maruti Suzuki launched in January, has already garnered about 17,000 orders, and the count is increasing.

Shares of auto companies have also performed well. BSE Auto, a benchmark index of auto and auto ancillary companies, has returned 17 percent in the last year. Mahindra & Mahindra and TVS Motor are two of the best performing stocks from the sector, with one-year returns in the 50-70 percent range.

One worry has been the poor sales of two-wheelers, which are largely bought by low- and mid-income riders. Motorcycle sales have stagnated, putting pressure on shares of Hero Moto and Bajaj Auto. Eicher Motors has been spared from the selloff as it sells motorcycles in the mid-range, demand for which remains strong.

Sin goods

The so-called sin goods — alcoholic beverages and cigarettes — have also seen strong growth despite challenges. The reason is that they are adapting to inflation, which is hitting the lower economic strata of society.

Some distilleries are banking on premiumisation of their products, targeting mid and high-income consumers, and this portfolio has seen double-digit growth. Cigarette makers, meanwhile, have introduced new sizes that are priced lower and are banking on formalisation of the market.

Hina Nagarajan, MD & CEO of United Spirits, which sells Johnnie Walker branded liquor, said the company continues to witness good growth post-COVID, particularly in the mid-upper segments of the Prestige & Above (P&A) portfolio. That is reflective of the consumption revival in the broader economic context, with the festive season adding further momentum, as mentioned earlier.

“Our premium Indian whiskeys and scotches continue to drive category expansion on the back of the sustained trend of premiumisation. Inflation and the larger global macroeconomic headwinds may act as a bit of a drag, but we believe that consumer demand will continue to be robust,” said Nagarajan.

Cigarette volumes have also been strong, with double-digit growth recorded across makers. ITC, the biggest cigarette seller, recorded 17 percent growth in revenue from this portfolio.

“Several differentiated variants continue to be launched to further strengthen the range of offerings and ensure future-readiness of the product portfolio,” ITC said in a statement.

Paints maker Asian Paints entered into a agreement with the Gujarat government on February 20 to set up a manufacturing facility in Dahej. The pact was signed through its newly incorporated, wholly owned subsidiary, Asian Paints (Polymers).

Asian Paints subsidiary will set up the facility for Vinyl Acetate Ethylene Emulsion (VAE) and Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) at Dahej, Gujarat. ""The company will make necessary disclosures on any material developments in this regard from time to time,"" the company said in a regulatory filing.

Asian Paints had last month incorporated Asian Paints (Polymers) with a share capital of Rs 100 crore. In 2022, the company's board of directors approved the setting up of a manufacturing facility for VAE and VAM in India. For this, the company had in October announced that it would invest Rs 2,100 crore over a period of three years.

The installed capacity of the unit would be 100,000 tonnes per annum for VAM and 150,000 tonnes per annum for VAE. VAM is a key input for manufacturing VAE.

According to Asian Paints, VAE is considered to be the emulsion of the future, and the key constituent for manufacturing environment-friendly paints. VAE offers better paint properties and can significantly improve paint performance in customer-facing attributes.

The market seems to be inching upwards gradually along with a shift in support as the Nifty50 climbed higher for the third week in a row, rising half a percent in the week ended February 17. The index has formed a bullish candle with upper and lower shadows on the weekly scale, indicating volatility.

Further, it has been making higher high for the week gone by, and higher low for second straight week. The index has breached the Budget day's high but there was some selling pressure at higher levels, leading to a close at 17,944.

The Nifty50 has crucial support in the 17,700-17,900 area, hence as long as it holds the same, 18,200-18,300 appear likely in the coming sessions, experts said.

Even the Options data indicated that 18,000 strike has maximum open interest on the Call as well as Put side, indicating a tug-of-war between bulls and bears.

""The recent price action could be seen as a constructive development for our markets as the index hover above the sloping trendline and has also attempted to transcend the sturdy hurdle of the 18,000 mark after two weeks of consolidation,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

As far as levels are concerned, he remains hopeful till the sacrosanct support of 17,800-17,700 is withheld firmly. On the flip side, sustenance above 18,000 could only bring the cheer back in the market, while on the higher end, 18,200 is likely to be the sturdy wall in a comparable period, says Sameet.

Despite the lacklustre moves in the indices, individual pockets kept buzzing and experts expect this to continue.

Hence, Sameet advocate traders to focus on a stock-specific approach for better trading opportunities and stay with a similar buy on decline strategy till the time important supports are held comfortably.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the February 17 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

HDFC: Buy | LTP: 2,694 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,580 | Target: Rs 2,950 | Return: 10 percent

The stock has been consolidating above Rs 2,600 level for quite some time now. Even though there was a weakness in the market, the stock held above the thin support line, otherwise it follows the market trend most of the time.

Technically, we can call it as a bullish divergence, which will reward positional traders in a bullish move in the market. The strategy should be to buy 50 percent at current levels and balance at Rs 2,650. Place stop-loss at Rs 2,580. On the upside, there could be a rally towards Rs 2,850 or Rs 2,950 in the medium term.

Tata Power Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 205 | Stop-Loss: Rs 190 | Target: Rs 230 | Return: 12 percent

The stock has been in the rectangle trading range for almost the last 15 months. It is following the trading range of Rs 190 and Rs 250. In the last eight weeks, the stock managed to stay above Rs 190 level, bucking the broad market trend, which had plunged to new lows.

The reward-to-risk ratio at the current levels is in favour of the bulls. Buy Tata Power between Rs 205 and Rs 195. For this, keep the stop-loss at Rs 190. On the upside, the stock may move towards Rs 230 with facing minor resistance near Rs 220.

Asian Paints: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,834 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,680 | Target: Rs 3,100 | Return: 9 percent

The stock has formed a higher bottom after touching highly oversold levels. It was at Rs 3,580 in the month of September 2022 and since then the stock was falling. It touched the level of Rs 2,685, which was the higher bottom level compared to the previous low of Rs 2,560.

Such type of pattern mostly favours the bulls, however, a breakdown of recent lows invites further weakness.

Traders can take a tactical trading call at current levels and on the further downside and keep a tight stop-loss at Rs 2,680. On the upside, it would find resistance near Rs 3,000 and Rs 3,100.

Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi

Borosil Renewables: Buy | LTP: Rs 478 | Stop-Loss: Rs 445 | Target: Rs 535 | Return: 12 percent

The free fall which started from July 20, 2022 resulted in 38 percent cut in price. At current juncture, the said counter has formed bullish Butterfly pattern which is looking lucrative at current market price.

In addition, it has also formed Bullish Engulfing pattern exactly around potential reversal zone of Rs 440-450 thus confirming bullish stance in the counter.

From indicator perspective, daily RSI (relative strength index) has made bullish divergence along impulsive structure near oversold level of 30.

One can buy in the range of Rs 470-480 and target would be Rs 535 with a stop-loss of Rs 445 on daily close basis.

Indiabulls Housing Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 113 | Stop-Loss: Rs 104 | Target: Rs 130 | Return: 15 percent

The relentless fall which started from December 30, 2022 resulted in 33 percent cut in price. At current juncture, the said counter has formed Bullish Engulfing pattern exactly around 0.618 retracement of its previous rally which started from September 2022.

In addition, buying volume is also picking up from lower levels thus confirming bullish stance in the counter. From indicator perspective, daily RSI has made bullish divergence along impulsive structure near oversold level of 30.

One can buy in the range of Rs 111-114 and target would be Rs 130 with a stop-loss of Rs 104 on daily close basis.

Gujarat Gas: Buy | LTP: Rs 485 | Stop-Loss: Rs 455 | Target: Rs 530 | Return: 9 percent

ONGC: Buy | LTP: Rs 156.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 148 | Target: Rs 170 | Return: 9 percent

The stock has been forming a ‘Higher Top Higher Bottom’ on the daily and weekly chart and is thus in an uptrend. The ’89 DEMA’ (day exponential moving average) has acted as a support in the recent corrective phase and prices witnessed a positive momentum during last week and have given a breakout above its resistances.

The RSI oscillator is in ‘buy mode’ indicating a positive momentum. Hence, short term traders can look for buying opportunities around current market price of Rs 156 for near term targets of Rs 165 and Rs 170. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 148.

Bosch: Buy | LTP: Rs 18,014 | Stop-Loss: Rs 17,600 | Target: Rs 19,300 | Return: 7 percent

The stock has consolidated within a range in last few weeks and has formed an ‘Inverted Head and Shoulders’ pattern on the weekly chart. Prices are on the verge of a breakout from the pattern and the momentum readings on the daily and the weekly chart are indicating a positive momentum.

During last week, we witnessed a gradual rise in volumes and hence we expect a positive move soon in the stock.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock around above Rs 18,250 for potential targets around Rs 18,900 and Rs 19,300. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 17,600.

The move will ensure more money in the hands of consumers and improve demand across sectors, experts said.

Following the announcement, the Nifty Auto gained over a percent, with Bharat Forge, Eicher Motors, Hero Motocorp, Bajaj Auto, Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors rallying between 1 and3 percent.

The Nifty India Consumption index also gained over a percent. Trent, Godrej Consumer Products, Tata Consumer, Page Industries, Asian Paints and Dabur were between 1.5 and 5 percent. FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd, the parent of Nykaa, gained 2.45 percent.

The Nifty Realty was up 1.87 percent, with Oberoi Realty, Lodha, Brigade Enterprises and DLF, emerging as yop gainers, trading 2-3 percent higher. The index also got a boost from an increase in allocation for the PM Awas Yojana.

S&P BSE Consumer Discretionary rallied 1.24 percent. Vishal Fabrics, Marathon Realty and Indian Hotels were the top gainers here.

Over the year, consumer companies have been dealing with margin contraction under high raw material cost pressures and lower volume offtake in an inflationary environment.Follow our live blog for the latest Budget 2023 updates

""The rationalisation of the personal income tax structure is expected to lead to two things - raise disposable incomes for the middle class, particularly younger taxpayers, and transition the taxpayers to the new tax regime with minimal exemptions and lower and simpler tax slabs. This is expected to give a moderate boost to domestic consumption,"" Suman Chowdhury, chief analytical officer, Acuité Ratings & Research, said.

Sumit Sabharwal, CEO of TeamLease HRtech, concurred. ""The reform makes complete sense considering inflation. It'll make India stronger with an accelerated growth path,"" he said.Follow our live blog for all the market action

Pent-up demand after the pandemic-induced lockdowns boosted the top line of most companies – paints, quick service restaurants (QSRs), consumer electronics, and apparels.

The 290 companies that make up the BSE Consumer Discretionary Index posted an over 19 percent year-on-year growth in sales and 170 percent YoY increase in net profit.

However, FY23 has turned out to be sombre so far. For the half-year ended September 2022, the net profit of the pack fell 25 percent compared to the six-month ended March 2022, while sales grew 3 percent. The index has fallen almost 40 percent last year compared with a 21 percent gain in the year before.

Operating margins of companies catering to discretionary spending have contracted over 100 basis points on the back of rising raw material prices. And the prospects for FY24 don’t look too bright either.

“We suspect the slowdown in discretionary consumption is due to a combination of factors: possible slowdown in new hiring in the organised sector, withering of pent-up demand, especially after the festive season, elevated inflation sapping household savings, and increase in mortgages due to a sharp jump in interest rates,” Kotak Institutional Equities said.

This became evident in the Q3 numbers. Asian Paints and Pidilite both posted volume growth that was little changed against expectations of 4-5 percent growth. Both flagged demand strain in the rural and semi-urban areas.

Electrical consumer goods company Havells reported a 7.2 percent fall in quarterly profit, citing “moderating” consumer demand.

“For quick service restaurants, we were expecting same-store sales growth of 8-10 percent in FY23, but it looks like we will end the fiscal with only 5-6 percent growth,” said Karan Taurani, senior VP - research analyst at Elara Capital.

Titan’s jewellery business growth moderated to a single digit after doubling in Q2 of FY22. But negating the high base effect, the three-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in volumes is 12 percent.

D-Mart operator Avenue Supermarts reported 3-4 percent per-store revenue growth as general merchandise and apparel segments did not do “as well as expected.”

Outlook for FY24

The modest sales growth reported by discretionary companies came largely on the back of prices that were increased to offset high raw material costs and the trend of premiumisation in metro cities. For top line and bottom line to grow sustainably, sales have to be driven by higher demand and volumes, but that is a long road ahead, analysts said.

While the Street expects 15-18 percent EPS (earnings per share) growth for consumer discretionary companies, foreign brokerages CLSA and Jefferies have said they see downside risks to this number. In the consumer space, they prefer staples over discretionary.

Also Read: Consumer staples to outperform discretionary stocks in H2FY23, says CLSA

“There are concerns about further slowdown in discretionary and retail, especially after nearly two years of strong recovery and aggressive network expansion. FY24 will also see EPS growth converging for staples and discretionary stocks, with downside risk to estimates in discretionary,” according to Jefferies.

Discretionary stocks continue to trade at a premium to staples and their own history and are prone to further de-rating in 2023 if growth moderates, it added.

Challenges, budget

The downside risks are mainly low levels of disposable income and low penetration of discretionary goods in India.

“A slowdown in startup funding has driven job cuts in several cases, even as an increase in interest rates would lead to higher EMI outgo for households,” according to Jefferies. In addition, there are sector-specific challenges such as rising competition in the paints and consumer electronics segments.

The electronics industry also has to deal with high import duties on motors and components. Since January 1, ceiling fans have become 8-20 percent costlier because of new norms set by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency. This will further affect consumer affordability.

The PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry has pushed for an increase in consumption-led demand in Budget 2023 through a hike in per capita disposable income. This can be achieved by enhancing consumption expenditure rebate to Rs 5 lakh per annum, the Chamber said.

Some industry leaders are batting for the basic income tax exemption limit to be increased to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 2.5 lakh and enhancement of standard deduction of Rs 50,000 to about Rs 80,000.

The government is likely to continue with its thrust on initiatives such as Make in India and production-linked incentive schemes to boost local manufacturing and employment generation.

Companies are asking the government for a five-year extension in the Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors with an increased outlay of Rs 10,000 crore in the Union Budget for FY24.

Rationalisation of goods and services tax rates is also on the wish list.

“We expect the government to look at categories like fans, which is a product of basic need and still being taxed at 18 percent. Mandatory star labelling norms have further led to price increases. We feel that the GST rate across energy efficient products should be reduced to help people switch to these products,” Rakesh Khanna, managing director of Orient Electric, told Moneycontrol.

Relief in import duties and input tax credits can help boost the health of the discretionary sector, said experts.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints (APNT) reported flat volume YoY (est. 5% growth) and weakerthan-expected product mix in its 3QFY23 results. Consequently, EBITDA/ PBT/PAT missed our estimates by 10-11%. Management indicated that after a weak Oct’22, partly caused by high base, demand recovered YoY in Nov’22 before reaching double-digit sales growth in Dec’22. Nevertheless, we expect near-term volume to be under pressure with EBITDA margin under check for the next 2-3 years because of potential competitive pressures and expanding capacity.

Outlook

APNT’s valuations are fair at 52.7xFY24E and 46.4xFY25E EPS. We retain our Neutral Rating with a TP of INR3,090 (based on 50xFY25E EPS).

Sharekhan's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints Limited’s (APL) Q3 numbers missed estimates with sales volumes remaining flat on extended monsoon, shorter festive season and a high base of Q3FY2022 due to pile-up of inventory prior to significant price hikes. Raw material cost deflation of 7% helped gross margins expand by 182 bps to 38.6% in Q3. With input prices expected to remain lower, the margins expansion to sustain in Q4. December saw volume growth recovering to double digits. The management expects the momentum to sustain in Q4. It is confident of achieving high single to low double-digit volume growth over the two to three years. (It will also be aided by planned capacity expansion in the coming years).

Outlook

Stock has corrected by 20% from highs and is currently trading at 71x/53x/45x its FY2023E/24E/25E EPS. Any further correction provides good investment opportunity from a long-term perspective. We maintain Buy with revised PT of Rs. 3,300.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian Paints

We cut our FY23/FY24/FY25 EPS by 6.3/9.1%/8.5% given 1) flat volumes during 3Q23 2) intent to maintain competitive pricing among rising competition with GM band of 38-40% & EBIDTA margin band of 17-20% and 3) lower other income due to Rs20bn capex on greenfield paints unit. 3Q saw a sharp 414bps QoQ ETBIDA margin recovery supported by 284bps QoQ gross margin improvement despite mix deterioration & no further price hikes. We believe APNT might pass on benefits of lower RM costs to consumers to push volumes and improve market competitiveness. Long term growth levers are intact led by 1) market share gains in decorative paints 2) increased distribution (addition of 10k retail touch points in 9M23) 3) innovations & focus on high growth waterproofing/wood finishes segment 4) scalability plans in home décor from 4% to 10% by FY26 (both organic and inorganic). We believe APNT’s plans of backward integration into VAE & VAM, white cement JV in UAE and nanotech emulsion paints shows larger plans of the company to grow in futuristic coating segments, the benefits of Rs8.75bn capex will start getting reflected from FY26 only. We see little scope of further re-rating given likely aggression from Grasim & JSW in Paints and impending capex plans.



Outlook

We value stock on DCF and assign target price of Rs3150 (Rs3326 earlier). we expect back ended returns given emerging competition and valuations of 47.2xFY25. Accumulate for long term gains only.

HDFC Securities' research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints’ top line grew 1.3% YoY (three-year CAGR: 16.8%); fell short of expectations (var: -3%). The decorative business was largely flat (0/1% volume/value growth YoY in Q3FY23 due to (1) an extended monsoon and shortened Diwali season and (2) a high volume base impacting growth. The worst of the margin pressure seems to be over as Q3 marked the end of a six-quarter upward RM spiral. Consequently, GM/EBITDAM expanded ~180/60bps YoY. RM moderation is likely to continue in Q4. Note: price hikes (+24%) are yet to catch up with RM inflation (+29%) since Q1FY22. APNT is embarking on a significant investment phase (INR87.5bn over three years) towards (1) capacity enhancement, (2) backward integration, and (3) acquisitions. While beneficial in the long run, it will certainly be a drain on FCFF and returns profile in the short to medium term.



Outlook

We largely maintain our FY24/25 EPS estimates (-1/-2%) and our REDUCE rating with a DCFbased TP of INR 2,680/sh (earlier: INR2,700/sh), implying 50x Dec-24 P/E.

Asian Paints on January 19 reported a 6.37 percent growth in consolidated net profit for the quarter ending December 2022 at Rs 1,097.06 crore. The company had reported a profit of Rs 1,031.29 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

Consolidated revenue from operations came in at Rs 8,636.74 crore, up 1.28 percent from Rs 8,527.24 crore in the year-ago quarter.

The numbers were worse than estimates. Net profit was expected to grow 8.7 percent to Rs 1,104 crore from a year earlier and sequentially by 40 percent, according to the average of estimates of brokerages polled by Moneycontrol. Revenue was expected to rise 10.9 percent YoY to Rs 9,456 crore.

“The domestic Decorative Business registered a flat volume and value sales delivery for the quarter, on a very high price increase base in the previous year,"" said Amit Syngle, Managing Director & CEO of Asian Paints. ""The extended monsoon in October also affected retailing in the peak festival season; but demand picked up in November and December leading to a double-digit growth for the Decorative Business in December.""

The company said its industrial business did well led by strong growth in the Auto OE and general industrial segments. Meanwhile, the international business was a mixed bag with good growth in the Middle East and Africa while the South Asia market, especially Sri Lanka and Bangladesh,

Asian Paints share price edged higher in the afternoon session on January 19 with the Mumbai-based paintmaker set to announce its December quarter earnings later in the day.

The paint company is expected to report single-digit year-on-year growth in net profit in the third quarter of FY23 on the back of muted volume offtake and weak demand, a Moneycontrol poll has shown.

Net profit is expected to grow 8.7 percent to Rs 1,104 crore from a year earlier and sequentially by 40 percent, according to the average of estimates of brokerages polled by Moneycontrol. Revenue is expected to rise 10.9 percent YoY to Rs 9,456 crore.

The numbers are set to be hit due to muted volume growth, analysts said. One reason is the high base effect.

Volume growth will also be impacted due to extended rainfall in October, which affected festive demand. Moreover, the pent-up demand that followed COVID-19 lockdowns has eased and inflation affected discretionary spending. All this will impact volumes, analysts said.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin for the quarter has been pegged at 17.1 percent, higher by 250 basis points sequentially.

At 12.28 om, Asian Paints was quoting at Rs 2,965.00, up Rs 19.15, or 0.65 percent, on BSE. It touched an intraday high of Rs 2,972.10 and an intraday low of Rs 2,925.45.

Asian Paints is expected to report single-digit year-on-year growth in net profit in the third quarter of FY23 on the back of muted volume offtake and weak demand, a poll showed.

Net profit is expected to grow 8.7 percent to Rs 1,104 crore from a year earlier and sequentially by 40 percent, according to the average of estimates of brokerages polled by Moneycontrol. Revenue is expected to rise 10.9 percent YoY to Rs 9,456 crore.

The company is scheduled to announce its Q3 results during market hours on January 19.

The numbers are set to be hit due to muted volume growth, analysts said. One reason is the high base effect.

“We expect overall volume growth of 4 percent YoY on a base of 18 percent YoY in Q3 FY22,” analysts at Nuvama Research noted.

Volume growth will also be impacted due to extended rainfall in October, which affected festive demand. Moreover, pent-up after the COVID-19 lockdowns has eased and inflation has affected discretionary spending. All this will impact volumes, analysts said.

“However, November and December marked a good recovery, particularly in exterior paints, which is a higher-margin product,” Nuvama Research said.

EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margin for the quarter has been pegged at 17.1 percent, higher by 250 basis points sequentially.

According to Kotak Institutional Equities, margin expansion will come on the back of a further fall in crude oil prices, but will be partly offset by deterioration in the product mix.

“We expect EBITDA margin to contract YoY due to lower operating leverage,” it added.

Asian Paints said on January 8 it will set up a water-based paint manufacturing facility with an annual capacity of 4 lakh kilolitres soon. The investment of Rs 2,000 crore for the project would be in addition to the Rs 6,750 crore expenditure announced in the Q2 results, said analysts.

Apart from the company’s capex plans, investors will also track comments on the demand outlook in the metros and tier 2/3 towns, raw material pricing, and increased competitive intensity.

Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are likely to see an improvement in their margins sequentially in the October-December quarter due to the liquidation of high-cost inventory and a fall in raw material prices. Revenue growth, however, is expected to be slower due to inflation affecting demand, mainly in rural areas, say analysts.

For the 19 consumer companies under its coverage, Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects 9.3 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in topline, 9.6 percent in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) and 8.1 percent in net profit.

The majority of the revenue growth will be driven via price hikes, which companies took in the past quarters to combat raw material inflation.

“With no clear signs of recovery in rural demand, we expect sales in staples to be driven by price increases and some premiumisation,” Motilal Oswal said.

According to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE), Nestle and Britannia will lead the staples pack with revenue growth of 19 percent YoY and 16 percent YoY. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is expected to post 14 percent YoY revenue growth.

“Foods will outperform personal care. Biscuits and noodles are expected to see robust momentum due to downtrading from street food,” stated Nuvama Institutional Equities.

Rural demand still sluggish

Rural demand did not improve at all in Q3, note analysts. Dabur India in its Q3 business update highlighted that the pressure on rural demand was further aggravated by the late onset of winter in north India.

Marico’s Q3 business update was also downbeat. The Parachute oilmaker said its consolidated revenue will grow in the low single-digit on a YoY basis due to a muted recovery in rural demand amid elevated inflation.

“General inflation and rainfall deficit in populous states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal and Jharkhand remain the key challenges, which have affected rural disposable income,” according to analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities.

Margins and volume growth

The good news for FMCG companies is set to come on the margin front. Gross and operating margins will see sequential improvement as raw material prices have cooled off significantly from their peak and high-cost inventory has been liquidated. However, analysts believe that increased ad spends can keep margin improvement in check.

“The major benefits of benign raw material prices will be witnessed in Q4FY23 onwards,” as per a note from Philip Capital.

Meanwhile, volume growth is expected to be subdued. Kotak analysts expect 4 percent underlying volume growth from HUL, 4 percent from Britannia and 2 percent from Godrej Consumer. In October, HUL cuts soaps prices across India due to a fall in palm oil prices, and as a result, volume trajectory is likely to improve in soaps, believe experts.

Discretionary demand dwindles

The picture looks grim for discretionary companies as the industry saw a demand slowdown in Q3 across paints, jewellery, apparel and QSR (quick service restaurants).

“Paint volumes remained muted in October due to a high base and rains, which affected festive demand, but November and December marked good recovery,” notes Nuvama Institutional Equities.

KIE estimates Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac’s revenue to decline YoY by 1 percent and 5 percent respectively. Berger Paints and Indigo Paints may clock 7 percent and 8 percent revenue growth, respectively.

“Varun Beverages and Westlife Development should report a good print, whereas Jubilant Foodworks, Devyani International and United Spirits should report a weak quarter,” the report added.

Westlife Development’s average daily sales are expected to be resilient, partly aided by a 2 percent price hike taken in October while Varun Beverages is set to outperform on the back of market share gains in under-penetrated areas with its energy drink Sting.

Asian Paints plans to set up a new water-based paint manufacturing facility with an annual capacity of 4 lakh kilo litres soon. The approximate investment of Rs 2,000 crore for the project will be over and above the Rs 6,750-crore capex announced in Q2FY23 results, believe analysts.

""The company is exploring the possibility of making this investment and setting up the facility in Madhya Pradesh. It is expected to be commissioned in three years after acquisition of land,"" it has said in an exchange filing.

The stock opened flat on January 9. At 9:30 am, it was quoting at Rs 2,981 on the National Stock Exchange, higher by 0.1 percent. It has fallen close to 16 percent in the last one year.

During the Q2FY23 earnings concall, top boss Amit Syngle had announced a Rs 6,750-crore of capex plans. The investment will be used for setting up a manufacturing facility for Vinyl Acetate Ethylene Emulsion (VAE) and Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) in India, acquiring a nano-technology player and increasing the paints capacity to 22.7 lakh KL.

With the new announcement, the capacity could now go up to 26.7 lakh KL. Currently, the company has 17 lakh KL capacity.

These back-to-back capex announcements have analysts worried about the company's cash flows and return ratios. According to a report released by HDFC Securities after Asian Paints' Q2 results, ""While this investment phase is beneficial in the long run, it will certainly be a drain on free cash flows and returns profile in the short to medium term.""

The brokerage firm has a 'sell' rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,700 per share.

Asian Paints' cash and cash equivalents as on September 30, 2022 stood at Rs 1,885 crore. FY22 RoE (return on equity) was 24.65 percent.

JK Cement, a wholly owned subsidiary JK Paints & Coatings, invested an amount of Rs 153 crore and completed the acquisition of 60 percent equity shares of Acro Paints. The ""remaining 40 percent shall be acquired over a period of 12 months as per the definitive agreement entered between the parties"", a joint statement said.

On track to complete four years of operation in April 2023, JSW Paints aims to double its sales year-on-year. It's revenue was Rs 1,100 crore in FY22.

While smaller players are trying to make room for themselves in the segment, the biggest competition for Asian Paints will come from Grasim. The company is investing Rs 10,000 crore by FY25 for paints capacity of 13 lakh KL, which is close to 75 percent of Asian Paints' current capacity.

(Photo by ROMAN ODINTSOV/Pexels)

Banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) companies dominate the list of stocks that analysts are most optimistic about, though the list was led by an infrastructure company, Larsen and Toubro (L&T).

The stocks that analysts are most pessimistic about are from myriad sectors, with analysts largely concerned about their rich valuations. Despite its operational improvements, JSW Steel tops this list, from the Analyst Call Tracker for December.

Also read: JSW got maximum downgrades over the last year. Which stock got the maximum number of upgrades?

The BFSI sector is expected to do well on the back of credit growth and financialisation of savings. In its report on the outlook for 2023, HDFC Securities’ Institutional Research unit has picked BFSI as the top sectoral pick in anticipation that strong credit growth (mid-teens in the previous two quarters) will continue in FY24.

The analysts stated that while retail credit has been robust, they expect wholesale credit demand to pick up as well because of capex recovery. The brokerage forecast the net profit of banks and NBFCs in their coverage to grow at 26% CAGR from FY22 to FY24.

Insurance is seen to benefit from a structural shift of Indians choosing financial products for their savings, versus their traditional preference for real estate and gold, after bank deposits. A recent study by rating agency Crisil noted that life insurance has the largest share (39%) in the managed investments industry, which has total assets under management (AUM) of Rs 135 trillion. Mutual funds come second with around 28% of the total AUM.

Capex revival sparks optimism

Like banks, infra major L&T is benefiting from hopes of capex revival. According to a December 20 report from Jefferies, which has a ‘buy’ call on L&T, the company’s power transmission and distribution and railways verticals are expected to do well in the next twelve months with renewable-energy and railway capex push. In the quarter to date, 21% of the company’s orders came from Railways, 20% from oil and gas, and 10% each came from industrial construction and power transmission and distribution.

Another factor working in L&T’s favour is its improving return ratios, especially through sale of loss-making assets such as L&T IDPL, an infra-asset ownership entity. In the report, Jefferies’ analysts noted that the company has been working to improve its ROCE and ROE. Going by the brokerage’s estimates, ROCE is expected to rise from 8% in FY22 to 10.7% in FY25 and ROE is forecast to rise from 10.9% to 15.9% over the same period.

Asset monetisation has played an important role. The analysts expect L&T’s EPS for FY24-25 to see an addition of 1.5-2% from the sale of IDPL. This is because L&T does not have to carry IDPL's annual loss, which is approximately Rs 1 billion to Rs 1.5 billion, through JVs. And, the company would have earned around Rs 2.4 billion to Rs 2.9 billion (after reducing L&T’s Rs 11 billion investment in IDPL) from the sale. The brokerage also believes that Nabha Power and Hyderabad Metro will also be monetised over the next 12 to 36 months.

Stocks inducing maximum pessimism

Pessimism towards JSW Steel, the topper on this list, seems to be led by its valuation and debt levels. Analysts at ICICI Securities, in their December 22 report, did note the operational efficiencies the company has introduced and the focus on digitisation and sustainability, but retained their Sell call. They pointed to the high valuation of 7.5x FY24E, which is the highest among its peers, as a key deterrent and noted that the high net debt/EBITDA of 2.3x (FY24E) relative to peers is a concern.

Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE) too upgraded earnings and fair value (FV) estimates, after a visit to the company’s Dolvi (Maharashtra) plant, and believe that the company “has crossed a critical scale such that its internal cash flows can now sustain its aggressive growth ambitions”. They estimate that the company would need a capex of Rs 450 billion over FY2023-25E for capacity expansion and that it could generate free-cash flow (FCF) of ~Rs 600 billion over the same period, thanks to strong volume growth and deleverage. But KIE’s analysts retained their sell call on rich valuations of 7x EV/EBITDA FY2024E, in a December 16 report.

Wipro follows JSW on the ‘Maximum Pessimism’ list, which shouldn’t be that surprising considering how it has been the Nifty stock to deliver the worst performance in 2022. While the headline index went up by nearly 3% in 2022, the IT major’s stock has fallen by more than 40% over the same period. The company’s exposure to a slowing consulting business with its $1.5-billion acquisition of Capco is also a matter of concern, as are its lacklustre revenue and profit figures for the past few quarters.

In general, investor sentiment towards domestic tech stocks have worsened with fears of a recession in the US, where the retail market has shown signs of weakening. Wipro’s exposure level to retail is among the highest in the industry (19% of revenue in Q2FY23 versus 8.1-16% for its Tier-I IT peers, according to a Nomura report).

Two surprises in the pessimism list

The stocks that analysts are most pessimistic about are Asian Paints and Adani Enterprises. Asian Paints has long been a market darling with its undisputed leadership in the paints segment. But in December, only 43% of the 40 analysts covering the stock gave it a ‘buy’ call. While 12 analysts have given a ‘hold’ call, 11 have tagged the stock a ‘sell’.

The Street is concerned about increasing competition in the paints segment. Asian Paints has announced big capex plans of Rs 6,750 crore over the next three to four years for more pricing power. Meanwhile it may have to sacrifice earnings in favour of growth, and that makes the rich valuation look undesirable.

Adani Enterprises, which has delivered a 124% increase over the last year, has only one of the two analysts covering it giving a ‘sell’ call. The other, which is DAM Capital, has issued a ‘hold’ call. Moneycontrol has reached out to the analyst for the report and this article will be updated on receipt",1070,0.24133138259251913

On track to complete four years of operation in April 2023, JSW Paints has managed to make room for itself in the competitive paints market. “We recorded sales of approximately Rs 1,100 crore in FY22. It is the fastest any paint company has reached Rs 1,000 crore,” said Joint MD and CEO AS Sundaresan in an interview to Moneycontrol. In FY21, the company's revenue was Rs 430 crore, as per reports.

“We aim to double year-on-year,” he said. That means sales of Rs 2,200 crore in FY23, but he did not confirm the numbers.

The company’s revenue sees equal contribution from both the industrial and the decorative paints segments. In the industrial segment, coil coatings is the bigger piece of the pie. “Today, we are certainly the largest coil coating player in India. We are the first Indian company to have developed our own technology in this segment and commercialised it,” Sundaresan added.

For coatings, Asian Paints has a tie up with US-based PPG, while Berger Paints collaborates with Beckers, of Germany. JSW Paints has still not ventured into the automotive paints segment, unlike its listed peers.

Decorative fortunes

The company’s main focus is to grow the decorative segment aggressively. “We are operating with a start-up mindset. We are looking to build a paints company of the future,” said the top boss.

Its unique selling proposition is — Any Colour, One Price. This is not the industry norm. Bigwigs like Asian Paints and Berger Paints charge differently due to the various pigments that come from different sources.

Also Read: Up and coming competitors are not a worry for Asian Paints, says Saurabh Mukherjea

According to Sundaresan, other brands charge consumers 5-15 percent more. Catering to the economy as well as premium segments, the company’s lowest price point starts from Rs 80 / litre, and goes up to Rs 1,000 / litre.

Naturally, the three-year old company has some working capital debt, and it is looking to break-even in the decorative segment in the next two quarters. “However, we are already profitable at the company level as well as in the industrial segment,” Sundaresan clarified.

Reaching customers

The company has a capacity of 100 million litres in the decorative segment with a utilisation of 50 percent, while it has a 50-million-litre capacity in the industrial segment with a utilisation of 70 percent. Asian Paints, which has the lion’s share of the market, has a total capacity of 1,700 million litres. Meanwhile, Grasim is eyeing to launch its paint business by FY24 with a production of 1,300 million litres.

Competition is tough and JSW Paints has to fight tooth-and-nail for market share. The company has 75 depots and about 5,000 retailers across India.

Also Read: Will Grasim drain Asian Paints’ moat?

Apart from the Any Colour, One Price strategy, to make itself visible on the retailer’s shelves, the company is also highlighting other aspects of the product, like better market coverage than competitors, low volatile organic content (VOC), and reliable finish.

“We don’t dump our stock on retailers. We have a very compact range packed with several features. For instance, we don’t have separate ranges for anti-microbial and odour-free and sheen-finish. We pack many features in one. So, retailers can manage with less stock,” said Sundaresan.

Once they run out of stock, the company can service fresh orders within a few hours, or 1-2 days at most, he added.

“We aim to grab 5-10 percent of the market in the next 3-5 years,” concluded Sundaresan.",591,0.868268883228302

After moving closer to 18,900 level in the beginning of December, traders seem to have preferred profit taking and hence the Nifty50 is caught in a bear trap. The index lost more than 1 percent in the week ended December 9, after run-up in previous two consecutive weeks. Slightly hawkish tone by the Reserve Bank of India and caution ahead of FOMC meet weighed on market sentiment despite correction in oil prices amid global recession fears.

The index closed a tad below 18,500, the support which was being held on to for several sessions in the recent past. Overall if the same gets decisively broken then Nifty can take support at crucial 18,400-18,300 area, whereas on the other side, 18,600-18,700 zone is going to be near term resistance followed by new high, experts said.

""The Nifty is now placed slightly above the key support of '20-day EMA' (exponential moving average - 18,465) which coincides with previous swing high of 18,450. Hence, we continue to remain upbeat as long as 18,400 – 18,300 is not violated on a closing basis,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

Until then, he feels any intermediate decline should only be construed as profit booking before resuming the upward trend.

On the flipside, 18,650 – 18,700 are the levels to watch out for. The moment Nifty surpasses this, one should gear up for yet another milestone of 19,000 in the near future, the expert said.

Traders are advised not to get carried away by such small declines. Rather it’s better to focus more on thematic moves, especially from the broader end of the spectrum, Sameet advised.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the December 9 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Thermax: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,057 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,875 | Target: Rs 2,350 | Return: 14 percent

The stock is in the last leg of a corrective pattern. It could drop to Rs 1,950 or Rs 1,960 levels, where it has seen key support since March 2022.

Technically, it will mark the second low in the last two months. Our advice is to buy the stock 50 percent at current levels and the balance at Rs 1,950 with a final stop-loss at Rs 1,875 and we can keep a target of Rs 2,350 or Rs 2,450 in the medium term, which is the pullback level for the stock.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,631 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,590 | Target: Rs 1,722 | Return: 5.6 percent

It is forming a triangle consolidation formation between Rs 1,640 and Rs 1,590 range. It has shown a trending move from Rs 1,365 levels.

The overall formation is suggesting that the current formation is a continuation formation and on the dismissal of Rs 1,642, it will jump to the level, which lies between Rs 1,675 and Rs 1,722.

Buying around Rs 1,630 and Rs 1,620 is appropriate with a stop-loss at Rs 1,590.

Divis Laboratories: Sell | LTP: Rs 3,274 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,350 | Target: Rs 2,978 | Return: 9 percent

The stock is forming a series of lower top and lower bottom. On weekly basis, the stock closed below Rs 3,330 level, which was last week's low.

It is negative for the stock and it may witness further weakness till the next level, which is at Rs 2,978. The stock closed on a weekly basis at Rs 3,274 and based on technical analysis, the downside is favourable for short sellers with a stop-loss at Rs 3,350.

Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC: Buy | LTP: Rs 449.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 430 | Target: Rs 490 | Return: 9 percent

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC has corrected from a high of Rs 503 touched in September 2022. The stock recently found support around the Rs 400 levels in October 2022. This is close to the previous intermediate lows, indicating a double bottom formation. The stock has subsequently bounced back and made higher bottoms in the last few weeks.

Last week, the stock broke out of a trading range on the back of healthy volumes, which is encouraging. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI (relative strength index) too have bounced back and are in rising mode now.

With the intermediate technical setup too looking positive, we believe the stock has the potential to move higher in the coming weeks. We recommend a buy between Rs 440-460 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 430 and target at Rs 490.

Suprajit Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 350.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 332 | Target: Rs 382 | Return: 9 percent

After correcting from a high of Rs 470 in January 2022, Suprajit Engineering found support around Rs 272 levels in March 2022. These are strong supports as they are just above the 200-day EMA.

The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. This week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range on the back of huge volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.

With the intermediate setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. One can buy between Rs 348-355 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 332 and target at Rs 382.

Bata India: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,679 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,739 | Target: Rs 1,580 | Return: 6 percent

Bata is in a short term downtrend as it has been making lower tops and lower bottoms for the last several weeks. Recently, the stock broke down below its recent supports and also reacted from the 20-day SMA last week. This indicates that the downtrend looks set to continue.

Technical indicators are giving negative signals as the stock is now trading below the 20-day and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI are in decline mode and not oversold, which implies potential for more downsides.

We therefore expect the stock to correct further in the coming sessions. One can sell between Rs 1,670-1,684 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,739 and downside target at Rs 1,580.

Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

Asian Paints: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,227 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,030 | Target: Rs 3,580 | Return: 11 percent

The stock consolidated after retracing 50 percent of prior up-move (Rs 2,560-Rs 3,546) and witnessed a range breakout. The stock also closed above its 20-week EMA and rose to 9-week closing high.

Its weekly Stochastic is positively poised; its RSI gave buy signal, while its MACD (moving average convergence divergence) is on the verge of a bullish cross-over.

The stock has potential to move towards Rs 3,490 initially and Rs 3,680 subsequently.

In case of any decline, the stock will continue to find support at around its 50 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of prior up-move.

Colgate Palmolive: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,657 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,570 | Target: Rs 1,820 | Return: 10 percent

Since couple of weeks, the stock oscillated above its cluster of moving averages (20-week EMA, 50-week EMA and 100-week SMA) and poised for a breakout.

In the last two weeks, the stock witnessed a steady rise with above average volume, which signals that major market participants were in favour of the bulls.

The key technical indicators are positively poised on medium-term as well as short-term timeframe charts. We believe the stock will rebound utilising prior consolidation and move towards its life-time-high.

On the lower side, the stock will find support around its cluster of moving averages.

Dr Reddy's Laboratories: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,407 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,210 | Target: Rs 4,900 | Return: 11 percent

Post a trendline breakout, the stock again tested that extended line and formed a bullish reversal pattern. The stock also found support around its 100-day SMA and reversed.

This could take the stock towards Rs 4,600 initially and Rs 4,900 subsequently.

Major technical indicators are in favour of the bulls on the near-term timeframe chart.

In case of any volatility, the stock will find support around its long-term moving averages (100-day and 200-day SMAs).

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 934 | Stop-Loss: Rs 908 | Target: Rs 985 | Return: 5.5 percent

The banking index has been showing an outperformance and it is continuing its uptrend after some consolidation phase. Within the private sector banks, Axis Bank is showing strength and has given a breakout above its previous swing high resistance.

The prices above its 20 EMA support, the volumes along the price upmove are good and the RSI oscillator is indicating a positive momentum.

Hence, we expect the uptrend to continue in Axis Bank, so short term traders can look to buy this stock around Rs 934 for potential targets of Rs 969 and Rs 985. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 908.

Suprajit Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 351 | Stop-Loss: Rs 337 | Target: Rs 376 | Return: 7 percent

The stock has been consolidating within a Symmetrical Triangle pattern since last few months and prices have given a breakout from the pattern on Friday. This entire consolidation is above its weekly 200 EMA which indicates that long term uptrend is still intact.

The volumes have improved in last couple of sessions and if the stock gives a follow up move, then it could lead to a decent trended upmove going ahead.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock around current market price of Rs 351 for potential targets around Rs 365 and Rs 376. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 337.

Rebound in rural demand, easing inflationary pressures and recovery in margins bode well for consumer staple companies and could see them outperform discretionary stocks in H2FY23, foreign brokerage firm CLSA has said.

“We continue to see high base affecting growth for the discretionary names. On the other hand, staples stocks, on a low volume base in H2FY22 and with gradual easing in inflation, are placed well to report better earnings,” it said in a recent report.

In the December quarter last year, HUL, Colgate and Marico reported low single-digit volume growth, while discretionary companies like Varun Beverages, Asian Paints and Titan clocked a volume growth upwards of 20 percent.

As rural markets account for nearly 69 percent of India’s population, staple companies are now pinning hopes on volume recovery backed by a good harvest, higher minimum support prices (MSP) and an increase in fertiliser subsidy, which will leave consumers with more money to spend.

Around 58 percent of the total 751 rural respondents noted improvement in income over pre-Covid levels, said CLSA, citing its proprietary survey. Rural demand has rebounded in October and companies are hopeful of the momentum sustaining.

Discretionary companies, on the other hand, witnessed strong sales in October due to the festival season but the demand tapered off in November, the foreign brokerage firm said. “Discretionary companies are cautious on demand momentum,” it added.

CLSA’s preferred picks in consumer staples are Hindustan Unilever with a target price of Rs 2,950, Dabur with a target of Rs 625 and ITC Rs 375.

From August to November, ITC gained 10.6 percent, HUL 3.52 percent, Godrej Consumer was up 2.3 percent and Dabur gained 1.3 percent. Consumer discretionary stocks also gained in the same period. Varun Beverages was up 35 percent, Titan 11.7 percent and Pidilite gained 10 percent.

Saurabh Mukherjea, whose portfolio management services (PMS) fund is heavily invested in paint producer Asian Paints, is not worried about competition heating up in the paints industry. He rather believes it is good news.

In the last few years, a number of new players have announced their entry into the paints industry including big pocketed players like JSW Group and Grasim Industries.

“This is a competitive free market economy and we need our companies to be kept on their toes by credible challenges emerging,” Mukherjea told Moneycontrol. “But the barriers to entry are extremely high.”

The paints industry in the country is dominated by Asian Paints with the rest of the market share divided among Berger Paints, Kansai Nerolac, Indigo Paints, and other smaller players.

Some have expressed concerns that the entry of new players will lead to market share erosion for Asian Paints and could also result in lower margins due to pricing pressure.

However, Mukherjea said making it big in the paint industry is not easy. He cited a number of examples of companies that have failed to make a mark in the industry in India such as Shalimar Paints and Sherwin-Williams Paints.

Paint business, especially the business-to-consumer (B2C) part, relies on brand name and distribution network for success. Asian Paints boasts a wide and efficient distribution network including dealers and shopkeepers. It also has a solid image among construction workers.

A bigger opportunity

For Asan Paints, a bigger opportunity is the home decor market, said Mukherjea. The business is still in its nascent stage as it contributes barely 3 percent to the total revenue of the company.

“Paint is Roughly a $10 billion business industry, in which Asian Paints has cornered roughly half of it. Our reckoning is home decor is a $50 billion market,” said the prolific investor.

Asian Paints has been excited about the decor business for a while now. Last year, it had about 29 stores for this business and now it has added about seven more stores, taking the count to 36 stores. The ‘Beautiful Homes Service’, which is a personalised Interior design to execution service, is live in 11 cities now.

Its home decor business has two components – kitchen and bath. According to its latest earnings statement, sales for the bath fitting business increased by 51.2 percent year on year (YoY) in H1FY23 to Rs 219.77 crore from Rs 145.38 crore. For the kitchen business, sales increased by 35.1 percent YoY in H1FY23 to Rs 226.87 crore from Rs 167.95 crore.

“The traditional model is gradually going to fade away because people like you and me are too busy to project manage and home decor,” said Mukherjea.

Competition is good

According to Mukherjea, more competition is actually good news for Asian Paints. It will help the company become more agile and in turn, the stock will make more money for investors.

“We need new entrants to come in, talk a good game at the outset, hire good people, and give our investing companies a run for the money because that's how our investing companies will get more efficient. As they become more efficient, return on capital goes up, more cash will come out, and we will compound faster.”

Geojit's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints (APNT), is engaged in the business of manufacturing, selling and distribution of paints and related product for home décor. APNT is the market leader in the Indian paint manufacturing industry. APNT reported a below expected result as inferior product mix and an extended monsoon impacted the top-line growth, which grew by 19% YoY in Q2FY23. Volume in the decorative business grew by 10% YoY while value growth was 20% YoY. EBITDA margin improved by 177bps YoY to 14.5%, which is below the expectation as the recent steep price hike has impacted the product mix. The demand was dominated by economy emulsion & undercoats during the quarter. The company announced a capex plan of Rs. 6,750cr over the next three years for capacity expansion and backward integration.



Outlook

The company’s foray into the white cement business and in-house capacity expansion by 30% to 22.7 lakh KL per annum to support profitability in the long term. We therefore, reiterate Buy rating on the stock with a TP to Rs. 3,416, based on a P/E of 60x on FY24E EPS.

These plans can dent free cash flow and return-on-equity (RoE) in the medium-term, believe analysts.

Here’s a look at the company’s investment plans:

Capacity expansion: Rs 3,400 crore for increasing in-house paints capacity by 30 percent to 22.7 lakh KL.

VAM and VEM plant: Rs 2,100 crore to set up a manufacturing facility for Vinyl Acetate Ethylene Emulsion (VAE) and Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) in India. The facility would have capacity of 100,000 tonnes for VAM and 150,000 tonnes for VAE.

VAE is considered to be the emulsion of the future, the company said, and it is the key constituent for manufacturing environment-friendly paints. VAM is a key input for manufacturing VAE.

White cement facility: Rs 550 crore to set up white cement manufacturing and export plant in Fujairah, UAE, with capacity of 265,000 tonnes per annum. For this, Asian Paints has signed a binding term sheet with Riddhi Siddhi Crusher & Land Transport.

White cement is a key raw material in the manufacturing of powder paints and undercoats like putty.

Acquisitions: Rs 800 crore for acquisitions like White Teak, Weatherseal and Harind. While White Teak and Weatherseal acquisitions were announced earlier, Harind Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals is the newest one.

“At the moment, we are taking about a 51 percent stake in Harind, and additional stake of 39 percent could be acquired over the next five years. Harind is a specialty chemicals company and it has the NexGen nanotechnology as its core,” said MD and CEO Amit Syngle during Q2 earnings concall.

According to analysts at HDFC Securities, while this investment phase is beneficial in the long run, it will certainly be a drain on free cash flows and returns profile in the short to medium term. The brokerage firm has a Sell rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,700 per share.

Meanwhile, analysts at Elara Securities believe the backward integration plans will impact the return on equity (RoE) in the medium term. It has pegged FY23 RoE at 30.7 percent, FY24 at 32 percent and FY25 at 33 percent. They have a Sell rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,865.

Domestic brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher believes the benefits of the Rs 6,750-crore capex plan will start getting reflected from FY26 onwards. “We see little scope of further re-rating in the stock, given likely aggression from Grasim & JSW in the paints sector and impending capex plans,” said Amnish Aggarwal, head of research at the firm. They have an Accumulate rating, with a target price of Rs 3,326 on the stock.

New capex plans might dilute the return on capital employed (ROCE), Motilal Oswal Financial Services added. It has a Neutral rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 3,150.

However, the company’s management is confident of the long-term prospects of backward integration into VAE and white cement manufacturing. “I think, gross margin improvement of about 4-5 percent will easily happen,” Syngle said.

The stock has declined 5 percent since announcement of Q2FY23 results. The company’s net profit at Rs 803 crore was sharply below analyst expectations of Rs 1,068 crore. Volume growth at 10 percent was also below estimates of 12-13 percent. This was largely on the back of downtrading from luxury range to premium and economy products. EBITDA margin came in at 14.5 percent. However, analysts had estimated EBITDA margin at 18 percent.

The stock closed at Rs 3,082.50, down 1.25 percent, on the National Stock Exchange on Tuesday, 25 October 2022.

Sharekhan's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints Limited’s (APL) volume growth in the decorated paint business moderated to 10%, affected by extended monsoon in southern and western parts of India impacting sales of exterior paints. Volume growth is likely to improve in H2 with key levers in place. Inferior mix led to lower realisation growth of 10%, resulting in gross margins dropping to 36% compared to 38% in Q1. With correcting input prices and better mix, management is confident of gross margins recovering to 40% by Q4. The company would be investing around Rs. 6,800 crore over the next three years towards expanding domestic paint capacity by 30% and backward integration to secure supply of key inputs (driving efficiencies and margins).

Outlook

APL is currently trading at 76.6x and 55.6x its FY2023E and FY2024E earnings. We maintain Buy on the stock with an unchanged PT of Rs. 3,689.

FY23/FY24/FY25 EPS by -7.1%/-1.7%/-1.5% given 1) expected margin recovery from 3Q23 as commodity prices have peaked out 2) narrowing gap between inflation and price 3) strong demand for both B2C and B2B segments in paints 4) improved mix in paints and sustained traction in home décor, waterproofing and projects business. 3Q reported a sharp 200bps QoQ decline in margins despite calibrated pricing action as higher cost raw material inventory and inferior sales mix impacted profitability. We believe long term growth levers are intact led by 1) market share gains in decorative paints 2) increased distribution (addition of 8k retail touch points in 1H23) 3) innovations & focus on high growth waterproofing/wood finishes segment 4) scalability plans in home décor from 4% to 10% by FY26 by both organic and inorganic means. We believe APNT’s plans of Rs34bn capacity expansion and backward integration into VAE & VAM, white cement JV in UAE and nanotech emulsion paints shows larger plans of the company to grow in futuristic coating segments and adhesives. We believe benefits of Rs67bn capex will start getting reflected from FY26 only. We see little scope of further re-rating given likely aggression from Grasim & JSW in Paints and impending capex plans.

Outlook

We value stock on DCF and assign target price of Rs3326 (Rs 3446 earlier). Accumulate for long term gains only.

Asian Paints on October 20 reported a 32 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 803 crore for the quarter ended September 2022, aided by price hikes. Net profit stood at Rs 605 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.

Sequentially, the profit declined 22 percent from Rs 1,036 crore recorded in June quarter of FY23. The net profit figure is sharply below analyst expectations of Rs 1,068 crore.

Consolidated revenue came in higher at Rs 8457 crore for the quarter, an increase of 19 percent over Rs 7,096 crore recorded in the same quarter of previous fiscal year. Sequentially, the revenue dropped marginally by 1.7 percent from Rs 8,606 crore.

The company also declared interim dividend of Rs 4.40 per equity share along with its Q2FY23 numbers.

Soon after the results, the stock tumbled 2.51 percent. At 2:30 pm, the stock was quoting Rs 3,132 apiece on the National Stock Exchange.

According to an average of estimates of brokerages polled by Moneycontrol, revenue will rise by 23 percent year-on-year to Rs 8,724 crore. Net profit is expected to grow 80 percent from corresponding quarter of last fiscal to Rs 1,068 crore. Sequentially, net profit will likely grow 2.5 percent.

As per analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities, Asian Paints’ growth outperformance versus peers should continue even as the gap may narrow. “We expect 15 percent YoY growth (+12 percent on 3-year CAGR basis) in subsidiary revenues,” they noted.

The company’s volume growth might come in at 12 percent YoY, estimates by Motilal Oswal Financial Services and Nuvama Research suggest. Combination of 12-13 percent volume growth, price hikes and strong traction from decorative and B2B business will help the topline, according to Axis Securities. “Exterior paints' demand in July-Aug was impacted by heavy rainfalls but saw robust comeback in September, with onset of festive season,” Nuvama Research added.

ICICI Securities, on the other hand, has moderate expectations from volume growth. It has modelled 7 percent rise YoY, owing to high base and softer demand in the rural regions.

EBITDA margins have been pegged at 18 percent, which indicates an expansion of 530 basis points year-on-year. This will be on the back of softening raw material prices, strong operating leverage benefits and cost efficiency programs. Prices of titanium dioxide, a key input material for paint manufacturing, has declined 10.3 percent quarter-on-quarter, notes Motilal Oswal.

Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) makers are expected to report strong revenue growth in the quarter ended September 2022, thanks to price hikes in the previous two quarters to offset input cost inflation.

For the 19 consumer companies under Motilal Oswal’s coverage, 16.7 percent growth is expected in revenue, 13.6 percent in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) and 12.9 percent in net profit.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects 17 percent revenue growth for Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), 15 percent for Britannia, 13 percent for Nestle and 12 percent for ITC’s FMCG business.

“Food and beverages categories should fare better than some home and personal care categories. We expect ITC, HUL, Britannia and Nestle to lead the pack,” Kotak Institutional Equities said.

Margins and volume growth

Revenue will expand, but margins will continue to be under pressure because of high-cost inventory. Analysts expect lower spot prices of raw materials to aid margins from the next quarter onwards.

“The prices of key commodities such as crude and palm oil have eased in the recent weeks, but they are unlikely to benefit margins in Q2FY23 as the decline came in only towards the end of the quarter,” Motilal Oswal said.

The full benefit of lower raw material prices is likely to come about only in H2FY23. Companies’ commentary on raw material prices, rural recovery and outlook for H2FY23, as the festive season kicks in, will be key to watch, Axis Securities said.

Volumes growth in most categories will be dented because of product weight reduction, high consumer inflation and a sustained slowdown in rural demand.

“Rural demand, which is 40-50 percent of industry demand, is reeling under burden of higher agri-input inflation. There are clear signs of downtrading across brands – hyperinflation in day-to-day essentials weighed on consumer disposable income,” Philip Capital said.

In its Q2FY23 update, Marico said its India business will record low single-digit volume growth. Dabur, too, warned of weak demand trends across categories in the quarter gone by.

Kotak Institutional Equities has pegged 4-8.5 percent domestic revenue growth with subdued volumes for Dabur, Godrej Consumer and Colgate.

For Marico, the securities firm expects 1.8 percent year-on-year domestic revenue growth on the back of low single-digit volume growth.

Paints and discretionary category

Asian Paints is expected to lead the paints pack with high double-digit growth. Axis Securities expects Asian Paints to deliver 32 percent year-on-year growth, driven by a combination of 12-13 percent volume growth, price hikes, market share gain, and expansion of the dealer network.

IDBI Capital expects Asian Paints’ revenue to grow 24 percent year-on-year. With prices of key raw materials such as crude and titanium dioxide decreasing by 16-17 percent on a sequential basis, the company’s EBITDA margin is expected to grow 500 basis points YoY to 18 percent. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

When it comes to QSRs (Quick Service Restaurants), Philip Capital expects 12 percent price-led same store sales growth for Jubilant Foodworks on account of 12-14 percent price hikes taken in the past year.

“Westlife Development shall see much better performance (+25 percent) versus Jubilant Foodworks due to higher share of dine-in (as consumers are facing fatigue towards delivery models)” the note added.

For United Spirits, Nuvama Research (earlier known as Edelweiss) expects revenue growth of 13.1 percent YoY while profits and margins will take a hit as higher priced inventory will show up in this quarter.

Meanwhile, United Breweries’ revenue growth is expected to slow sequentially due to the peak summer season in Q1FY23. High barley and glass bottle prices might impact gross margins of the company.

Max Financial Services: Sell | LTP: Rs 753 | Stop-Loss: Rs 790 | Target: Rs 710-700 | Return: 6-7%

In an order dated September 8, the anti-trust regulator said no prima facie case of contravention of the provisions of either section 3 or 4 of the Competition Act is made out against Asian Paints.

Accordingly, the fair trade regulator disposed of the complaint filed by JSW Paints. JSW Paints had alleged that after they launched their decorative paints segment, Asian Paints began to pressurise and target the dealers who had agreed to stock and display their decorative paints manufactured by the company.

Further, the complainant had stated that they were planning to launch its products in the south and west India. However, they had been denied access to the market even in these states and faced the same resistance in other regions due to coercive action taken by Asian Paints against the dealers. Thereafter, a probe was ordered by the anti-trust regulator in 2020 after the complaint filed by JSW Paints.

Sections 3 and 4 of the Competition Act deal with anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominant market positions, respectively. In its 45-page order, the commission notes that JSW added 1,591 dealers over FY 2019-20 and FY 2020-21, while Asian Paints added only 1,217 new dealers during the same period.

However, the figure of dealers clearly demonstrates that JSW Paints' entry into the market has not been obstructed as they claimed it. Therefore, the regulator dismissed the allegation against Asian Paints in relation to the denial of market access to JSW Paints.

There were also allegations by the dealers that they were being targeted not to deal with JSW Paints is not substantiated, as the percentage of dealers who discontinued their relationship with Asian Paints is much higher. Further, none of the dealers gave any credible evidence to substantiate their claims.

As regards the allegations of attempts by Asian Paints to pressurise the dealers to return the JSW Paints tinting machine, CCI's DG could not find incriminating evidence from any dealer that could corroborate the allegation against Asian Paints. Also, there were allegations made by some dealers in respect of the reduction of credit limit of the dealers by Asian Paints.

However, the regulator noted that the actions made by Asian Paints are stated to be based on objective criteria and uniformly applicable practices to protect its business interest. Therefore, the regulator said that JSW Paints has not been able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commission and the allegations that it made against Asian Paints could not be substantiated to form a prima facie view in the matter.",459,-0.8946629524230957

Shares of Asian Paints, Kansai Nerolac, Indigo Paints, Akzo Nobel and Berger Paints gained 2-4 percent in the first hour of trade on Thursday as crude prices dropped below $85, for the first time since January. Asian Paints was among the top gainers on the NSE and BSE, surging close to 2 percent.

As per estimates, crude derivatives form about 40 percent of raw material costs for large paint companies. With crude oil prices easing from highs, paint manufacturing costs will be lesser and margins will be higher, explain experts.

On Wednesday, oil tumbled on fears of recession and global demand concerns, with Brent crude futures settling down $4.83 to $88 a barrel, falling below $90 a barrel for the first since February 8. WTI crude settled down by $4.94, or 5.7 percent, to $81.94, its lowest since January.

Analysts remain largely bullish on the sector. ICICI Direct has a ‘buy’ call on Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 3,740. “The share price of Asian Paints is in a well-established secular uptrend and has generated stable returns for long-term investors on a consistent basis over the past many years,” the brokerage firm said in its report.

Meanwhile, Sharekhan has a ‘Buy’ rating on Indigo Paints with a target of Rs 2250. “Key input prices (including emulsion monomers, titanium oxide & packaging material) have corrected from highs and company will continue to see sequential improvement in the gross margins in the coming quarters,” the latest Sharekhan report said.

When it comes to Kansai Nerolac, Geojit Financial Services recommends an ‘accumulate’ rating with a target price of Rs 567. ICICI Securities has an ‘add’ call on Akzo Nobel with a target price of Rs 2,050.

On the business side, the companies are hiking prices every quarter to offset the raw material cost inflation has caused since the Ukraine–Russia war erupted. Berger Paints is looking to take a 1.5-2 percent price hike across product categories in early September, while Kansai Nerolac’s management is also looking at raising prices in the industrial segment.

(Photo by maitree rimthong/Pexels)

Bank stocks continue to enjoy the most optimism—or maximum buy calls—from sell-side analysts in July, with the sectoral outlook improving on rising interest rates, expectations of higher credit growth and lower non-performing assets (NPAs).

All the analysts covering HDFC Bank and State Bank of India (SBI) retained their ‘buy’ call from June, but one analyst among the 51 analysts covering ICICI Bank placed a ‘hold’ call on the stock.

“The banking names were always doing well but the key variable that has changed is the Fed (US Federal Reserve) narrative. The Fed’s 75 bps (basis points) hike was read by the market to be a quite benign commentary on inflation. This basically lifted sentiment across the board, including emerging markets, and this is leading to a follow-through buying of the banking sector. Secondly, there is a positive surprise on the gross and net NPA numbers, which is lifting some of the PSU banks as well,” said Harendra Kumar, managing director of institutional equities at Elara Capital.

Infrastructure sector leader Larsen & Toubro came fourth on the optimism chart, with nearly all analysts giving it a buy and the one exception in Ambit Capital pegging it for a ‘sell’. The positive sentiment towards the stock was driven by the company’s strong order book both for the domestic and international markets, its diversification into new businesses such as hydrogen and green EPC, and good working capital management.

Healthy sales in specialty generics and opportunity in the domestic and emerging markets are making Sun Pharma look good, and 93 percent of the analysts (41 out of 44) covering the stock are giving it a ‘buy’ call. While most experts are optimistic about the stock citing the company’s minimal reliance on the US market, Goldman Sachs has given a ‘sell’ call on concern about price erosion in that market.

Optimism around agrochemicals player UPL may be driven by sector dynamics such as higher food prices in the international market and fertiliser subsidies. Then there are company-specific pluses too, such as new product launches and strong growth in its international business. One concern was its lower working-capital efficiency, with inventory build-up and receivables, but the management expressed confidence about keeping net working capital days at 80, which has been the average since FY21.

Strong demand recovery for power is helping all stocks in that sector, and NTPC is riding that wave. But there are other company-specific drivers as well. According to Kumar, the triggers include capacity additions, stable return on equity and rerating because of the renewable play. “It has now become a growth stock rather than utility stock,” he said.

Apollo Hospitals is seeing optimism on account of its market share gains and healthy cash flows that can fund its promising digital expansion; Hindalco continues to be a favourite because of its transformation into a provider of value-added products such as aluminium plates for electric vehicle batteries and its reduced dependence on London Metal Exchange price volatility; and ITC has impressed market commentators with its cigarette sales, which also came from reclaiming a slice of the pie from the grey market, and its impressive numbers in hotels and agribusiness.

Most upgrades over one yearGrasim continues to see the maximum rise in upgrades over the past year this month too. Buy calls went up by 30 percent (9 of 10 from 6 out of 10 a year ago). Analysts are optimistic about its foray into new business segments that have adjacencies with its core business, such as paints and a B2B e-commerce platform for building materials. The latter requires a capex spend of Rs 2,000 crore, which has already been approved by the management, and analysts see this as an opportunity for the company to diversify further into associated segments.

Eicher retains the second spot this month too. The share of buy calls on the share has gone up 20 percent year-on-year. That is, a year ago, 45 percent of analysts covering Eicher gave it a buy call. This July, this has gone up to 65 percent. The company is largely riding on domestic sales going up.

Titan is a new entrant in this category and has seen a 19.45 percent increase in buy calls over the last year. Its strong sales numbers for the June quarter, which was a 205 percent increase over the previous year; rising demand for jewellery, especially in the festive season; and people moving to branded jewellery gave confidence to analysts.

Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki seem to be riding the general upbeat attitude to the auto sector, with demand improving and the shortage of semiconductors easing. The first saw the number of buy calls rise 19.45 percent (22 out of 31 analysts this year versus 17 out of 33 last year) and the second saw a rise of 17.47 percent (40 out of 53 analysts this year versus 29 out of 50 last year). Sell calls on Maruti were down from 12 to 7 this year. “The outlook for auto has improved after a few years because volumes are better, the semiconductor supply is easing, new product launches are doing well and the festive season is coming,” said Elara’s Kumar. He believes that the sector will see 18 months of secular growth now.

Strong loan growth, improvement in its interest rate margins, and a strong digital push seem to be driving the upgrades—16.67 percent on-year rise—for Bajaj Finance. The stock had 19 buy recommendations, 6 holds and 5 sells. Its parent company Bajaj Finserv was also among the stocks that saw maximum upgrades—a 16.36 percent increase over last year—again on the back of great results and the stock split announcement that was welcomed by shareholders.

A record increase in operating profits and net profit—63 percent and 41 percent on an annualised basis—in the June quarter could have lifted analysts’ outlook on Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). It saw a 12.82 percent increase in upgrades (with 31 out of 39 analysts giving a buy call versus 24 out of 36 last year). The company’s performance was driven by its oil-to-chemicals (OTC) business and high gross refining margins (GRMs). Cash flow from this segment of the business can help the company invest in its green-energy segment too, and the latter is seeing some positive commentary from analysts as well.

Maximum upgrades over last quarterITC led the pack with a 14.5 percent rise in share of upgrades. Thirty-three analysts gave this stock a buy call, while only 3 gave a hold call and none a sell. Last quarter, 27 analysts had rated it a ‘buy’, 7 ‘hold’ and one had ‘sell’.

Infosys also saw upgrades rise over last quarter, though the sector margins were under pressure. Nomura, which has a buy call on the stock, said that it prefers the stock over Tata Consultancy Services in large-caps because of Infosys’ “ongoing superior revenue growth profile”. CLSA, which too has a buy rating, said, “Large deal wins were modest but new business share has improved.” It added that all negatives have been priced in.

But Kumar believes that upgrades in the tech sector are a bit premature. “The outlook on the US economy is still hazy. We are likely to see some gyrations before they settle down to a level that is more believable,” he said.

Maximum upgrades over last month

Over the last month, sentiment towards RIL, Infosys and Nestle India seems to have improved because the three companies have moved up with their share of upgrades rising.

RIL’s upgrades went up by 10.3 percent on a monthly basis, Infosys’ by 5.8 percent and Nestle India’s by 5.6 percent.

Asian Paints came fourth with a 5 percent increase in upgrades over last month, with 19 analysts giving it a buy call versus 17 a month ago. Analysts believe that despite concerns about rising competition, the company will benefit from its strong position in the decorative-paints category, ability to take price hikes and improve margins from operating efficiencies, and expansion into home decor.

The push for clean energy, which involves considerable investment in transmission, and asset monetisation that could give good dividend yields could be what is driving the positive sentiment for PowerGrid. Twenty-two out of 27 analysts who rated the stock had a buy rating.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian Paints

We increase our FY23/FY24 EPS by 34.3%/29.3% given 1) bottomed out margins on sharp decline in input costs in past few weeks 2) Benefits of calibrated price increases (25% YoY) 3) strong demand for both B2C and B2B segments in paints 4) Improved mix in paints and sustained traction in home décor, waterproofing and project business. APNT reported marginal QoQ decline in margins despite calibrated pricing action and superior mix as 6% QoQ inflation impacted profitability despite strong broad based volume growth. APNT expects commodity prices to remain volatile in near-term although strong demand is likely to sustain. We believe long term structural levers remain intact led by 1) market share gains in decorative paints in an industry growing at double digits 2) increased distribution (addition of 5k retail touch points in 1Q23) 3) innovations & focus on high growth waterproofing/wood finishes segment 4) scalability plans in home décor from 4% to 10% by FY26 by both organic and inorganic means. We expect APNT to sustain premium valuations given strong growth visibility.

Outlook

We maintain our BUY rating with a TP of Rs 3363 (Rs 3018 earlier). However, valuations at 53.8xFY24/51.7xJune24 EPS will remain a little overhang given Grasim’s aggressive entry plans in Decorative paints in FY24.

Asian Paints shares opened in the green on July 27 - a day after the company reported an 80.4 percent on-year growth in consolidated profit at Rs 1,036 crore for the quarter ended June 2022, partly because of a low base.

The June 2021 quarter, when the company reported a profit of Rs 574.30 crore, was affected by the second Covid wave.

Consolidated revenue for the April-June 2022 period came in at Rs 8,607 crore, a 54 percent growth over Rs 5,585.36 crore reported in the year-ago quarter.

Citi

Broking house Citi has maintained 'neutral' rating on the stock with a target at Rs 3,400 per share.

There was a strong growth momentum, while revenue growth was well ahead of our/consensus expectations.

The realisation growth was at 16 percent also improved sequentially and raise earnings estimates by 10-12 percent, reported CNBC-TV18.

Credit Suisse

Foreign research firm Credit Suisse has kept 'outperform' rating on the stock with a target at Rs 3,800 per share.

The concerns over competition are valid, however company is looking to fortify its dominant position.

Credit Suisse raises FY23/24 EPS estimates by 3/4 percent, reported CNBC-TV18.

Morgan Stanley

Broking house Morgan Stanley has maintained 'underweight' rating on the stock with a target at Rs 2,674 per share as the Q1 earnings surprised positively.

The management remains hyper focussed on topline growth, however inflationary headwinds will remain in the near term.

Morgan Stanley feels that changing industry dynamics and lower margin profile to drive derating, reported CNBC-TV18.

Prabhudas Lilladher

We increase our FY23/FY24 EPS by 34.3 percent/29.3 percent given (1) bottomed out margins on sharp decline in input costs in past few weeks, (2) Benefits of calibrated price increases (25 percent YoY), (3) strong demand for both B2C and B2B segments in paints, and (4) Improved mix in paints and sustained traction in home décor, waterproofing and project business.

We believe long-term structural levers remain intact led by (1) market share gains in decorative paints in an industry growing at double digits, (2) increased distribution (addition of 5k retail touch points in 1Q23), (3) innovations and focus on high growth waterproofing/wood finishes segment, (4) scalability plans in home décor from 4 percent to 10 percent by FY26 by both organic and inorganic means.

We expect APNT to sustain premium valuations given strong growth visibility. We maintain our 'buy' rating with a target price of Rs 3363 (Rs 3018 earlier).

Sharekhan

The company is focusing dominant positioning on becoming complete home décor play in the long run gives us a visibility of better earnings growth in the medium term.

Market share gains, distribution expansion and sustained product additions will help the company to achieve consistent volume growth and maintain the leadership position in the paints business.

We expect APL’s revenues and PAT to grow at CAGR of 16 percent and 27 percent over FY2022-24. However, any increased competition from new entrant with higher capacity in the domestic paint industry would act as risk to profitability in the medium to long term.

We maintain our 'buy' rating on the stock with an unchanged price target of Rs 3,689.

At 9:30am, Asian Paints was quoting at Rs 3,146.90, up Rs 39.30, or 1.26 percent on the BSE.

Inflation has returned to be a worry for the paint makers even as crude prices soften. While the companies had witnessed an ebbing in prices of crude-linked derivatives during the financial year 2022 (FY22) helping their margins, the worry has returned as the other key commodities continue to surge, indicated Amit Syngle, CEO and MD, Asian Paints.

“Though crude has dropped a bit, the solvent categories have moved up quite significantly, and hence, we saw inflation hitting us again in the first quarter (Q1) of FY23,” Syngle said while addressing investors after reporting earnings for Q1. “Inflation is a big worry at the moment. The overall macro environment situation is very unpredictable and the rupee deposition is also a cause of worry.”

Asian Paints saw a 6 percent sequential surge in inflation in the Q1 of FY23 as compared to Q4 of FY22, while in Q4 the surge was only 1 percent as compared to Q3. The company indicated that in the second quarter (Q2) it expects inflation to remain in the single digits. The company’s gross margins for the quarter also took a hit and its gross margins dropped sequentially to 37.9 percent as compared to 39.7 percent in Q4. The company expects its gross margins to remain in this range in the quarters ahead.

“The overall gross margin range for some time might be in the band of about 38-40 percent. I don't see it going up to 40-43 percent levels immediately,” shared Syngle.

The company, indicated the management, has also taken a judicious and calibrated approach towards and will take price hikes going ahead and has announced a price hike of 2.5 percent in Q2 after raising the prices of its products by 2 percent in Q1.

“We are trying to balance our price increases and are taking very measured increases so we don't upset the consumer demand going forward,” said Syngle.

Despite the inflationary situation, the company indicated that the demand has remained stable across rural and urban areas.

Asian Paints reported consolidated revenue of Rs 8,607 crore in Q1, a year-on-year (YoY) jump of 54 percent, as compared to Rs 5,585.36 crore reported in the corresponding period last year.

Asian Paints on July 26 reported an 80.4 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated profit at Rs 1,036 crore for the quarter ended June 2022, partly due to a low base.

""The domestic decorative business more than doubled its volume and delivered stellar revenues over the lower base of last year, which had suffered from the first nationwide lockdown. The industrial business and the home improvement business also doubled its revenue on last year's low base,"" Amit Syngle, Managing Director & CEO of the paint company said.

The international business, which had seen some continuity in the first quarter of last year, registered strong double digit revenue growth.

On the operating front, its EBITDA for the June quarter increased by 88.65 percent YoY to Rs 913.56 crore and the margin expanded by 194 basis points (bps) at 10.61 percent compared to the same period previous fiscal. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Gross margin, however, contracted sharply to 40.26 percent in Q1FY23, compared to 54.67 percent in June 2021 quarter despite price hikes taken by the company due to higher input cost.

""Steep inflation in raw material prices in the last quarter of previous financial year and again in this quarter saw gross margins impacted across all businesses despite the price increases taken to mitigate this pressure to an extent,"" Syngle said.

Asian Paints is expected to clock around 45-70 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated profit after tax for the quarter ended June 2022 on significant growth in topline and operating performance. A low base is also expected to support earnings as the June quarter of the previous year was hit by the second Covid wave.

Brokerages expect strong volume growth with healthy realisation, which may push revenue growth higher by 30-50 percent compared to the year-ago quarter. The operating profit growth could be more than 50 percent due to strong topline for the quarter and low base of last year.

""We expect 35 percent and 54 percent YoY growth in volumes and value in domestic decorative paints aided by continued market share gains, focus on economy-end products and price hikes (up 25 percent YoY). We expect 34 percent YoY growth in subsidiary revenues,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities, which sees 73 percent growth in profit and 51 percent in revenue.

Asian Paints' strong growth outperformance versus peers such as Berger Paints, Kansai Nerolac Paints, and Akzo Noble would continue, the brokerage said.

Analysts at ICICI Direct expect Asian Paints to report consolidated revenue growth of 31 percent YoY on a favourable base and higher realisation (up 22 percent YoY) in Q1FY23.

""Market share gains and launches of new products will help drive volume up by 8 percent for the company during the quarter,"" the brokerage said.

On the operating front, Kotak expects a 200 bps QoQ and 175 bps YoY contraction in gross margin as price hikes would not fully offset the stubborn inflation in the crude basket.

The brokerage expects the EBITDA margin to expand 115 bps YoY on a low base (base quarter margins were depressed due to operating deleverage on account of the second Covid wave) but it sequentially, it may slip 75 bps QoQ.

The EBITDA growth maybe 62 percent YoY and 2.7 percent QoQ, it said.

Motilal Oswal also expects gross margin to decline YoY and QoQ due to the high inflationary environment. Tio2 prices, the raw material for the paint industry, grew by 54.9 percent YoY but was flat QoQ in Q1FY23.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Asian Paints

We spoke to a cross-section of APNT’s channel partners across Tier I/II/III cities. However, the sample size of our channel checks is limited and our findings may differ from broader demand trends. Some of the key highlights are as follows: Demand is better in urban cities than smaller towns and rural areas, especially after the steep price increases. Slower sales growth in Putty and the continued premiumization trend, after the lifting of COVIDrelated restrictions, augurs well for near-term margin and consequently our forecasts do not feature a material sequential decline in operating margin in 1HFY23, despite elevated titanium dioxide (TiO2) and crude oil prices. There has been a slowdown in the demand momentum in the last few weeks, starting from the latter part of Jun’22 – a usual phenomenon during the monsoons. In some pockets though, the slowdown is more marked than usual and needs to be monitored. There has been a strong demand recovery in Automotive and Industrial Paints in recent months.

Outlook

APNT has delivered an earnings CAGR of 11.6% over the past five years (FY17-22), while the stock price has delivered 24.1% CAGR, implying a significant re-rating. We have assumed FY24 gross/EBITDA margin at the top end of the management’s guidance of 41-42%/18-20%. While we expect RoE to improve, it will still be lower than the 30-40% recorded in the first half of the decade gone by. At 54.1x FY24E P/E, the stock remains expensive. We maintain our Neutral rating.

Drone startup EndureAir Systems has raised Rs 13.5 crore in a seed funding round led by Asian Paints co-promoter Jalaj Dani, the company said on Tuesday.

The round also saw participation from the founders of homegrown robotics and automation company Addverb Technologies.

EndureAir Systems plans to utilise the funds to speed up its expansion and scale up manufacturing and assembly units. ""This investment strengthens EndureAir System’s commitment to delivering world-class, innovative, high-performance UAV solutions to Indian customers quickly. The investment would be used to expand our product line-up to meet the futuristic demand for heavier payload capacity UAVs,” EndureAir founder and director Abhishek said.

EndureAir Systems provides unmanned aircraft system (UAS) and remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) solutions by performing a wide range of functions, such as border surveillance, logistics and medicine delivery, aerial mapping, crowd monitoring and providing situational awareness, for civil and military users.

""It complements our continuing commitment to robotics space which we identified as a thrust area about 5 years ago. Keeping with our honourable Prime Minister’s vision of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat’, supporting and strengthening locally grown talent in unmanned aviation would open unparalleled opportunities for applications of drones by virtue of its economies,” a spokesperson of Jalaj Dani Family Office said.

EndureAir has been shortlisted by the Ministry of Civil Aviation under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for promoting the manufacturing of drones and their components in the country.

""With the Indian, as well as global market, rising at an exponential rate, the increased adoption of drones is being appreciated by all end users.

Oil plummeted about 9 per cent on Tuesday in the biggest daily drop since March on growing fears of a global recession and lockdowns in China that could slash demand.

Global benchmark Brent crude traded around $102.77 a barrel, losing $10.73, or 9.5 per cent. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ended 8.2 per cent, or $8.93, lower at $99.50 a barrel.

Crude oil and its derivatives are major raw materials for paint companies. Thus, when the prices rose, shares of paint companies suffered greatly. And, now that the outlook has dimmed, the stocks have seen buying.

Berger Paints was up over 3 per cent, while Asian Paints climbed about 3 per cent. Kansai Nerolac jumped over 3 per cent as well, followed by Indigo Paints that rose about 2 per cent.

There have been contrasting projections on how crude oil may perform. At one end, JP Morgan said in the worst case scenario, it can rise to as high as $380. On the other end, Citi sees it at $65 by 2023-end thanks to recession fears that will likely clip demand.

Many money managers are also divided on the commodity. Jefferies’ Chris Wood sees it rising ahead, while Abakkus’ Sunil Singhania agrees with Citi’s assessment and sees it falling close to $80 per barrel.

All in all, the near term prospects for paint companies are still uncertain. Analysts tracking these companies also agree that in the near term the situation does not look that optimistic unless costs are passed down, but in the long term they are bullish.

After Grasim announced its massive capex plan for paints, the shares of India’s most decorated paints company Asian Paints fell sharply. Asian Paints, which is generally believed to be unshakeable with around 50 percent market share, fell to Rs 2,844 on BSE from its opening price of Rs 2,850 and its 52 week high of Rs 3,588 on May 26.

But, Rakshit Ranjan, co-founder of Marcellus Investment Managers, doesn’t see any reason to worry. Marcellus holds Asian Paints in its Consistent Compounders’ portfolio.

“We are not changing our position on Asian Paints,” he said.

In defence of the stock, Ranjan said that “every time Asian Paints stock falls by more than 20 percent, within three months, the next 12-month average performance is around 50 percent"".

He reaffirmed Marcellus’ and its celebrated founder Saurabh Mukherjea’s long-held stance that in the long term or over three to five years, stock price compounding mirrors free-cash flow (FCF) compounding. “We expect Asian Paints to maintain its historical run rate in FCF, so the stock price compounding will match that,” he said. Asian Paints’ FCF, like other stocks in Marcellus’ Consistent Compounder Portfolio, has seen around 25 percent CAGR for the past 20 years, according to Ranjan.

But right now, Ranjan said that they are really looking at the fundamentals of the company and if that will be affected by Grasim’s plans. They see no reason why they would be affected in the next two to three years.

Asian Paints' biggest strengths are delivering high inventory turns and its demand forecasting ability, which makes its high inventory turns possible. He does not see Grasim developing both in the next few years.

“Paint is a voluminous product. Asian Paints sells it through 1.5 lakh dealers without intermediaries. The end dealer does not make more than a low single-digit margin (approximately 5-7 percent). For the end dealer to make a return on working capital and fixed-asset investment, the dealer will need high inventory turns. In any industry, this would be possible to deliver, but in the paints industry, it is extremely difficult for two reasons,” he said.

“One the inventory turn needs to happen directly (at the retailer’s end) without a wholesaler or a distributor. If a company brings in a wholesaler or a distributor, and Grasim will probably have to bring them in, it will eat into their unit economics. Secondly, even if the company is willing to take a hit on its unit economics because it has a large balance sheet, it must have an incredible demand-forecasting ability to deliver (on inventory turns). Otherwise, the working capital drag for a voluminous product can be very, very high,” he said.

“It can hit the company’s working capital really hard, if demand forecasting doesn’t drive inventory turns because margins are very very thin here,” he added. Asian Paints’ demand-forecasting ability has a long history. It invested in a supercomputer in the early seventies and has since been collecting data on purchases across geographies, and this helps it predict what product will sell well and where.

Won’t a large company like Grasim be able to beat down the prices? Pricing is less important in this industry than delivering inventory turns, said Ranjan. “Customer relies on the painter’s recommendation, the painter recommends based on what is readily available with the dealer and the dealer stocks what delivers the highest inventory turns,” he said. A price difference of 5% does not matter much to the customer nor the dealer, he said.

True, Grasim may be able to develop these capabilities–of delivering better inventory turns and demand-forecasting ability–in several years but certainly not overnight. “Then the question is if Asian Paints will remain today’s company or will it be one with a deeper competitive advantage or one with a bigger barrier to entry,” he said.

Marcellus sees Asian Paints as evolving far beyond a paints company by adding more products, and moving beyond products and adding services as well. “We expect a healthy cash flow compounding, like it has delivered in the last 5 to 10 years,” he said.

The worst case scenario would be if the management loses focus. “Then things can go downhill pretty quickly. We don’t see that happening (at Asian Paints),” he said.

“In the long run, we expect the management to be agile, awake and fanatical about deepening their capabilities. If we see the management not doing all this, becoming complacent, losing their focus, then we will take corrective action,” he said.",759,0.1377963423728943

YES Securities' research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints (APNT) once again delivered a strong performance in a challenging environment with 8% volume growth on base of 48% volume growth despite a soft performance in January. Value growth stood at 21%; higher value growth was on account of price increases partially offset by deterioration in product mix. Growth was uniform for the company with strongest growth in West and East markets. The company is witnessing strong double‐digit growth in Tier 1 and 2 cities led by luxury and premium range, while tier 3 and 4 markets delivering growth in economy range. APNT has been aggressive in launching new products which now contribute 14% to the revenue. It is also aggressively expanding its home décor foray with extended offering across the product categories like kitchen, bath, sanitary ware, lighting, tiles, flooring, furniture, furnishings, doors and windows. APNT is targeting to nearly double its Beautiful Home stores to 70 in FY23. On international front, company saw growth from Asia followed by Middle east while Africa, Ethiopia and Srilanka are seeing impact of currency devaluation. Company is also aggressively expanding its distribution touch points and has added 15,000 retail points in FY22. Considering strong demand momentum despite sharp price hikes, under penetration of paints and opportunities in new segments and services, we feel demand for paints is expected to remain robust in medium term and APNT is in a sweet spot to capture a major chunk of incremental demand.Also, its foray into home décorto broaden its product and service offerings to a large consumer base is expected to make Asian a go to brand in the broader home improvement space. Its pricing power, distribution prowess and balance sheet strength should enable it to ward of any competition that comes in it way. Considering the above, we continue to remain upbeat on the stock and feel premium valuations are justified.



Outlook

We expect FY22‐24E Revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 18%/34%/39% respectively and maintain our BUY rating with TP of Rs3,708 valuing it at 60x FY24 EPS.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Asian Paints

Demand has been fairly resilient, with 8% volume growth in 4QFY22, despite a cumulative price increase of ~20% in FY22. In Tier I and II cities, the price rise has been absorbed, but there has been some impact on demand in smaller cities. The impact of raw material inflation in 4QFY22 was lower than our estimate. However, the management said APNT is witnessing a 5-7% sequential increase in its raw material basket against which it is taking a 2% price increase in May'22 and Jun'22.



Outlook

The current valuations of ~54.4x FY24E PE fully capture the upside over the next one-year. We maintain our Neutral rating.

Sharekhan's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints Ltd’s (APL’s) Q4 results were largely in line with expectations with an 8% rise in volumes of the decorative paints business and consolidated OPM of 18.3%. Revenue & PAT grew by 18% and 10% y-o-y, respectively. For FY22, decorative paint volumes grew by 31%. With strong demand in Tier-1 & 2 towns, the management is confident of achieving double-digit volume growth in FY2023 (February, March and April 2022 saw double-digit volume growth). Though volatile raw material prices will keep margins stressed in the near term, the management is confident of achieving OPM of 18-20% once raw material inflation stabilises while planned initiatives and better mix will support the profitability in the medium term.



Outlook

The stock trades at 72x/55x its FY2023E/34E EPS. We maintain a Buy on the stock with an unchanged PT of Rs. 3,689.

Asian Paints March quarter EBITDA is ahead of estimates and eight percent volume growth in decorative paints for the India market is impressive but inflation and price hikes remain a concern, according to Jefferies.

“Consolidated revenue grew 34 percent year on year in FY22… EBITDA was flattish on account of steep input inflation which resulted in a 720 basis point gross margin decline,” it said.

Jefferies' equity research team maintains that Asian Paints is expensive at 65x price to earnings ratio and has maintained underperform rating. It has revised its target price downwards from Rs 2,650 to Rs 2,530 per share.

Inflation remains a concern. “The firm had undertaken over 20 percent price hikes, but the effective price increase in the March quarter was 11 percent, implying down trading. The management commented that the steep price hikes resulted in demand deferment and down trading, especially in tier three and four towns,” said Jefferies.

If inflation continues, there will be further price hikes but they may not be as steep and will be “more calibrated”. While March quarter inflation was “muted” at one percent, the management expects June quarter to see five to seven percent inflation.

Asian Paints share price was trading lower by three percent in morning, a day after the company missed estimates as profit flatlined.

Asian Paints on May 10 reported half a percent year-on-year growth in consolidated profit at Rs 874 crore for the quarter ended March 2022, as higher input costs pressured operating profit margin. Exceptional loss of Rs 115 crore also hit profit growth. The CNBC-TV18 poll estimate for the bottomline was Rs 913 crore.

Revenue from operations grew 18.7 percent to Rs 7,893 crore with domestic decorative business registering eight percent volume growth.

""It was yet another quarter of solid and strong double digit value growth across all businesses despite uncertainty around COVID, macroeconomic challenges and heightened geo-political tensions,"" Amit Syngle, managing director and chief executive, said.

He further said the International business managed to deliver a double-digit revenue growth for the quarter despite severe challenges in key markets.

At the operating level, EBITDA increased 9.5 percent to Rs 1,443 crore. Margin was down 150 basis points to 18.3 percent but improved sequentially by 22 bps.

At 10:26 am, the stock was trading at Rs 2,986.10, down Rs 97.60 or 3.17 percent on NSE. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 3,106.75 and an intraday low of Rs 2,980.30.

""Asian Paints' performance remains the most impressive among top three players. We suspect future price hikes are likely to lag RM inflation, as demand elasticity may get tested. Hence, we marginally tone down our FY23/24 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 3.6/2 percent to account for lower GM (gross margin) and maintain our sell rating on the stock with a DCF-based target of Rs 2,550 per share, implying 53x FY24 price to earnings (P/E),"" said Varun Lohchab, head - institutional research, HDFC Securities.

On the other hand, brokerage firm Sharekhan has a buy call on the stock with a target of Rs 3,689, an upside of 23 percent: ""Asian Paints' results were largely in line with expectations with an eight percent rise in volumes of the decorative paints business and consolidated OPM (operating profit margin) of 18.3 percent.

Global research firm Citi has a neutral call on the stock and has cut the target to Rs 3,470 from Rs 3,515. It is of the view that Asian Paints reported decent results while input cost volatility continues. Demand trends remain reasonably steady despite macro challenges. EBITDA was up nine percent year on year, ahead of expectations given better cost control upside, the research firm said.

On March 20, 2022, the market was abuzz with a company’s delisting offer. The promoters of Elcid Investments were offering Rs 1,61,023 when the share was trading at Rs 17!

Elcid Investments is largely owned by the Arvind Vakil family, one of the four who founded Asian Paints.

Some would say the shareholders hit a jackpot with the delisting offer.

Yet, a minority shareholder is accusing the company and the promoter group of deceit. In a letter to Sebi, the minority shareholder Dhiraj Mittal accuses Elcid Investments and promoters of “engaging in acts that are deceptive and manipulative and apparently oppressive to the non-promoter shareholders”. The complaint has also reached the grievance cell of the Prime Minister’s Office.

Also read: Ease equity financing by empowering minority shareholders

This isn’t the first time the company is facing trouble with a delisting. The first time Elcid tried to exit the market was in 2013, the year Sebi mandated that listed companies needed at least 25% public shareholding. Since promoters didn’t want to reduce their holding, they offered to buy out public shareholders for Rs 11,455 a piece. It was a huge premium over the trading piece then of Rs 3. The offer was rejected.

So, why isn’t the offer price never enough, despite the huge premium over the trading price?

Hidden value

Shareholders believe the share is worth much, much more. They are basing their calculation on Elcid’s underlying assets, among which the most priced is its holding in Asian Paints. Elcid owns nearly 4.3% of the blue-chip company.

Taking the latest delisting attempt. The floor price has been set at Rs 1,61,023, which is a massive increase over the current trading price of Rs 17. Yet, the minority shareholder Mittal has presented a calculation that places the value of a share at a whopping Rs 6,36,405.

Mittal’s calculation, done through chartered accountants Agarwal Khemani and Associates, is based on Elcid’s holdings in Asian Paints. Elcid and its two fully owned subsidiaries–Murahar Investments and Trading, and Suptaswar Investments & Trading–earn only through returns on their investments. According to Mittal’s accountants, nearly all of Elcid’s net worth–which is Rs 10,165.22 cr, based on the consolidated balance sheet from March 31–comes from the value of its holdings in the paint company, which is 4.06 crore shares worth Rs 10,305 crore.

Each Elcid share has a claim over 203.07 Asian Paints’ share. Multiply this 203.7 by Asian Paints’ trading price of Rs 3,022 (April 19) and value of each share of Elcid goes up to Rs 6,13,776. Add the book value of Elcid Investment per share–which is Rs 14, 819–since the company has other holdings as well and the total intrinsic value of each Elcid share goes up to Rs 6,28,595.42.

Elcid’s manager to the delisting offer JM Financial has countered this method of calculation. They had appointed chartered accountants SSPA & Co to make a fair valuation of the company.

SSPA’s valuation of Elcid was based on valuations of comparable listed holding companies. JM Financial’s representative, in an email response to Mittal, said, “a price/ book value multiple of 0.2518 times was applied to the book value of the Target Company as on September 30, 2021”.

Listed holding companies usually trade at significant discounts to the underlying value of the investments (such as Asian Paints), as JM Financial has pointed out. This is because holding companies usually do not liquidate their investment and realise the value of assets, and therefore these assets remain dormant without any trigger for unlocking value.

JM Financial’s representative refused to answer questions related to the delisting, and SSPA did not want to participate in the story.

Off-market curve ball

The delisting process could have given minority shareholders a chance to realise the fair value of the share through the reverse book building process, but Mittal fears that is unlikely to be the case. In a reverse book-building process mandated by Sebi, the delisting company sets a base price (called the floor price) and shareholders place bids to offer their shares at the same or any price higher.

The final buy-back price offered will be the price at which the shares tendered take the holding of the promoter or acquirer to 90% of the paid-up capital, since this is the thresh-hold for delisting. The promoter can choose to accept this price or not go ahead with the delisting.

Mittal is concerned that an off-market transaction that took place on March 16, 2022–which was a few days before the delisting announcement–will skew the delisting in the promoters’ favour. This is because the transaction moved a significant amount of shares to Vakil family’s close associates, the Dani family.

Asian Paints was founded decades ago in 1945 by Vakil, Suryakant Dani, Champaklal Choksey and Chimanlal Choksi.

On March 16, 2022, Delhi-based Hydra Trading Private Limited bought 9.04% stake in Elcid from Rajan Shah of 3A Capital Services. Hydra is owned by Dani and lists Vita Jalaj Dani as one of its directors. Vita is the wife of Jalaj Ashwin Dani, the grandson of Suryakant Dani. Mittal said, “They are just warehousing the shares (to influence the reverse book building process).” Counting in this 9.04%, the Vakil, Choksi and Dani family hold 87.32%. So, Elcid needs to acquire only 2.68% from public shareholders to get ahead with delisting.

Questions sent to Elcid’s promoters and Sebi remain unanswered.

3A Capital Services’ Shah had been an aggrieved shareholder a few years back. He, along with other minority shareholders, in 2018 had approached the Bombay High Court with the issues related to Elcid Investments. Their concern was that the stock was not realising its full value because there was hardly any trading in the stock. There were plenty of willing buyers for Elcid’s shares but there weren’t any sellers because the price that was being quoted at the exchanges were in lower single digits, when shareholders believed that it should be quoting at much higher prices because of its intrinsic value. The intrinsic value that came from its Asian Paints’ holding, much like Mittal’s chartered accountant has calculated.

Shah and the other petitioners brought to light the fact that there were other off-market transactions taking place significantly higher than the last market price, but not representing the intrinsic value of the stock. An independent director of Elcid, Mahesh Dalal, his wife and daughter had bought 500 shares over six transactions for Rs 20,000-22,000 on February 8, 2018, when the share was trading close to Rs 5 at the stock exchanges. Two years later, on February 20, 2020, Ketan Chatrabhuj Kapadia bought 100 shares for Rs 35,000 when the stock was trading at the exchanges for approximately Rs 8.25. The shareholders wanted Sebi to intervene and set a fair price-discovery mechanism.

This February, four years after Shah and others approached the High Court, Sebi responded to their complaint. The regulator said that shareholders not being satisfied with the traded price cannot be treated as a complaint.

The Hydra deal may have come as a relief to Shah. Questions sent to him, including on the price paid for his holding, remain unanswered.

Sell or lose?

As of March 18, the Vakil family holds 74.9% and the Choksi family holds 3.3%. After the recent transaction, the families of founders of Asian Paints together own 87.24%. Mittal fears that public shareholders will be forced to accept the price asked by the promoters’ aides and a very small percentage of other public shareholders to make it to the cut-off 90%, because if they don’t, then they are left with poor choices.

One, the shareholders could choose to sell the shares in the one-year window available after the delisting process closes. However, this means a higher capital-gains tax of 20% versus the 10% that is levied during the delisting. Two, they can hold on to the shares and have to deal with a company that has considerably less regulator oversight. “Without regulatory oversight and without mandatory disclosures, the promoters could do anything with the company’s assets and we may not even know,” he said.

Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD of InGovern Research Services, said that this isn’t a problem restricted to one company alone. “Thousands of such cases are waiting to be unravelled. The two problems that this case brings to the forefront is of the difficulty in realising value in holding companies, and of minority shareholders being shortchanged in a delisting process. The current framework of Sebi and MCA (the Ministry of Corporate Affairs) isn’t enough to deal with these. We need a larger policy intervention here,” he said.

InGovern is a leading corporate governance research and shareholder advisory firm.

Under the present circumstances, either Elcid’s shareholders can band together and approach Sebi for redressal or they can hold onto their shares without tendering them during delisting and wait for an opportunity to unlock its value, he said.

To unlock its value, the shareholders could wait for investors who buy delisted stocks. These investors usually have the capital to fight the promoters in court and wait years for a favourable outcome. Or the shareholders could wait for the promoters of the holding company to sell the underlying asset–however far into the future that may be–and claim their share.",1560,-0.6494523733854294

Saurabh Mukherjea, chief investment officer (CIO), Marcellus Investment Managers, spoke on concerns emerging around the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger, about the sharp fall in the shares of HDFC twins, underperformers Nestle & Asian Paints, and on margins coming down in the Q4 for the consumption companies.

Dismissing concerns around the growth outlook for HDFC Bank going forward, Saurabh Mukherjea, speaking in an interview with CNBC-TV18, did not slash the earnings growth estimates going forward, and said the stock will continue to give high premiums for investors in the long term.

On being asked over some concerns regarding the weakness in HDFC twins after the merger announcement, Mukherjea said HDFC Bank was an outperformer in the private banking space in the last five years.

The analyst believed the stock price movement is momentary and the superior asset quality will keep the returns intact for investors.

Outlining his reason for this outlook, he stated he was positive about HDFC Bank with a long-term view. Mukherjea further said HDFC Bank could deliver around 20 percent, from a long-term perspective.

Mukherjea, reacting to a question on HDFC Bank and HDFC stocks witnessing sell off recently in the run up to the merger, said, ""Last five years have been spectacular. They have just blazed away. 20 percent loan book compounding and 20 percent deposits compounding.”

He also believed no other bank remotely matches up to HDFC Bank.

The analyst said, "" No other bank in the private space has been able to compete with HDFC Bank on both sides of the balance sheet. On gross and net NPAs also, no other private sector bank is even close to HDFC Bank. If HDFC's 2 percent ROA is seen, it is difficult to see any other with 2 percent ROA. If we look at the performance of HDFC Bank in the last 15 years, it is in a completely different league. Even in the last 3 years, no other bank came close to such performance.""

On being questioned again over pre-provisioning operating profits of HDFC Bank slightly looking weaker, Mukherjea said, ""We have to back companies which have delivered through decades in a stellar fashion. So, we back such companies which give 20-25 percent returns on our clients' investments.""

Coming out in defence of the merger, Mukherjea said, ""The merger will bring two very profitable businesses together. We will see their ROEs exceed and growth reaching high.""

The market expert added, ""Currently, HDFC Bank's mortgage runs on HDFC, so HDFC Bank's growth is reduced. When HDFC Bank holds on to mortgages, it will accelerate.""

Since their merger announcement on April 4, shares of HDFC Bank and HDFC tanked close to 15 percent each.

HDFC Bank, the largest private sector lender in India, on April 16 reported a 23 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in standalone net profit at Rs 10,055.2 crore for the quarter ended March 2022 as bad loans provisions declined 29 percent, with further improvement in asset quality. But the lender’s operating performance showed spots of trouble. Operating profit growth was just 10.2 percent for the quarter and the net interest margin was at a record low.

The analyst stated the succession plan for HDFC Bank was taken care of, when asked whether the new leadership will continue to produce the kind of results it gave and if there is a reason to worry.

Dismissing such concerns, the market expert said, ""We have closely monitored the succession planning. Shashi was mentored and trained by the erstwhile CEO. The operating metrics from the time Sahshi took charge are stellar. They are growing at a fast pace. Delivery impeccable on asset quality and growth. I give 10/10 to Sahshi.""

Mukherjea is also extremely bullish on Nestle India and Asian Paints.

The expert termed both the stocks which are market-leading franchises have been compounding consistently, and added, slight margin pressures witnessed by Nestle India do not add any material value.

He said, ""Nestle's share price compounded around 25 percent in the last five years. Profits compounded to 22-23 percent. It is obviously a dominant player in its category. There is food cost pressure. It utterly dominates the category that is a compulsory purchase.""

Mukherjea, reacting to the performance of Asian Paints in the stock market, said margin pressures of the company should not be a concern for long-term investors.

""Whenever crude doubles over a two-year period, Asian Paints' operating gross margins are solid. This results in the share rallying. Share price of Asian Paints in the last 12 months compounded. It has gained rapidly in the last 4-5 years,"" said Mukherjea.

The expert noted rising raw material costs and inflation have acted as a dampener for both the business companies.

Nestle India on April 21 reported a 1.3 percent decline in its net profit to Rs 594.7 crore for the quarter ended March, which came in below Street expectations of Rs 625 crore. It registered a 10.2 percent growth in revenues from operations to Rs 4,002.14 crore.

Sharekhan's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints Limited (APL) acquires 49% stake in White Teak (present in decorative lighting products & fans) for Rs. 180 crore and 51% stake in Weatherseal (present in uPVC windows and doors) for Rs. 19 crore. Both acquisitions are in line with APL’s focus of transforming itself from ‘share of surface’ to ‘share of space’ in the long run. APL expects revenue contribution from the home décor business to increase to 10% over the next two-three years from current single digit. APL plans to utilise its network of strong distribution points and institutional clients to grow both businesses. In the near term, both the businesses are unlikely to add materially to its earnings.

The second-generation scion of Asian Paints, joined the company in 1968 as a senior executive and rose through the ranks to eventually lead it. Dani’s contribution has been instrumental to Asian Paints’ growth as the largest paint maker in the country with a group turnover of Rs 21,700 crore. Dani held various roles with the company over the years as its director (research and development), works director, whole-time director and vice-chairman and managing director, and is known for bringing innovative ideas to the company and the paints industry through research and development. He was the brains behind computer colour matching, a concept now widely used in sectors like paints, plastics, printing inks and textiles. He is also credited with the development of products like Apcolite Natural Wood Finish, a novel finishing system for wood surfaces, and Automotive Refinishing System, a quick-drying alkyd enamel widely used in the automobile after-market segment.

On winning the IBLA Lifetime Achievement Award , Dani said, ""India has its own heritage and its own taste for paints and the very reason why we succeeded in India is because when I entered the paints industry, among the top seven paint companies, Asian Paints was the only Indian company and all other six companies were British. No other company wanted to give us technology at that time. Our chairman told me that there is no other alternative but to be atmanirbhar.""

Dani played a significant role in navigating the company through a rough patch when ICI India, a subsidiary of British chemicals major ICI Plc, made a takeover bid for Asian Paints in 1997 after the exit of a co-promoter family. Dani along with other co-promoters successfully thwarted the takeover attempt. Life came full circle when Asian Paints acquired a stake in ICI India when the Indian government sold its stake. Today he guides the company as its non-executive director.

Dani over the years has been a recipient of several awards and accolades and was conferred with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Indian Paint Association (IPA) in 2011.

He holds a master’s degree in polymer science from the University of Akron, US, and a diploma in colour science from Rensselaer Polytechnic, New York. He has also completed his bachelor’s degree in paints technology from UDCT University of Mumbai.

While receiving the award, Dani said that he is thankful for the training he got at UDCT, part of Mumbai University after which he went to (University of) Akron for further studies. He said that he did not prefer to join IIM-A in 1965, having got admission and paid fees. Would any of the youngsters do that in today's time? he asked. ""Because MBA is so deeply embedded. In any industry first thing you must achieve is certain level of technology and then you can apply any norms of management. Today if you combine the sales of number 2 and number 3 company, they cannot match our sales,"" he said. ​

Talking about business in current times, Dani said that the way of doing business has changed completely and that digital technology has come at such a speed and at such a short span of time. But he said that Asian Paints was the first Indian company to have a main frame computer in 1973.

""We rented out one shift from Godrej at night in 1972 so that we could use the computer for all three shifts because computer was very expensive and we were relatively small company back then and could not afford the expense of a digital main frame computer at that time. We used to write our own software.""

He said that when he took up the first course in computers when he went for his masters in 1966 at Akron he did not get credit for the course. ""But I said, I have come to this country not only for learning paint technology. I want to learn what this computer animal is. I was very happy in 1968 besides paint formulation I also concentrated in the implementation of computers. You ask any computer manufacturing company in India they would be proud to sell first computer to us,"" Dani added.",735,0.7804267803827921

Sharekhan's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints Ltd’s (APL)’s stock price has recovered from recent lows with sharp correction in the crude oil prices from its highs of $130 per barrel. Yet, any further decline in the stock prices from the current levels due to persistent volatility in crude oil prices should be considered a good entry point for investment from a long-term perspective. We have reduced earnings estimates for FY2023/FY2024 by 7%/4% to factor in the near-term volatility in input prices and rural slowdown. Nevertheless, recent correction in crude oil prices would alleviate concerns on significant deterioration in profitability in FY23. Market share gains in core paint categories, scale-up of the home decor business and drivers such as rapid urbanisation, growth in home improvement projects and a recovery in the real estate cycle remains a key growth driver in the medium to long term.



Outlook

We reiterate our Buy rating on APL with a revised price target of Rs. 3,689. The stock is currently trading at 71.0x and 55.2x its FY2023E and FY2024E earnings.

The paint industry is set to add another colour in its palette as JK Cement Ltd, a well-known manufacturer of grey cement, has announced its foray into the paint business.

The board of the company, which met this evening, cleared the company’s proposal to enter the paint field. JK Cement will get into the paint business through a wholly-owned subsidiary.

The board has also approved an investment of Rs 600 crore into the paint venture which will be infused over a five-year period.

“The subsidiary would undertake manufacturing, selling, trading, importing and exporting and otherwise dealing in all types of paints and allied products and services,” the company said in a stock exchange filing.

The paint sector, which was once dominated by a few companies such as Asian Paints, Nippon Paints, and Berger Paints, has witnessed several new players lately. For instance, Aditya Birla Group announced its paint business via its unit Grasim Industries. Then there is Jindal Paints. That apart, MRF is also into making specialty paints for the auto and white goods segment.

“Over four decades, the Company has partnered India's multi-sectoral infrastructure needs on the strength of its product excellence, customer orientation, and technology leadership,” the company said on its website.

JK Cement’s operations commenced with commercial production at its flagship grey cement unit at Nimbahera, Rajasthan in May 1975. The company has an installed grey cement capacity of 15 million tonnes per annum as on date, making it one of the top cement manufacturers in the country.

“JKCL is the No. 1 manufacturer of wall putty in the world and the third largest manufacturer of white cement, globally, with a total white cement capacity of 1.20 million TPA and wall putty capacity of 1.2 million TPA. JK White Cement is sold across 43 countries around the globe and the company has a strong international presence with two subsidies, JK Cement Works Fujairah FZC and JK White Cement (Africa) Ltd.,” the company's website said.",329,0.95515904823939

The impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict can be felt far and wide across sectors and asset classes. However, the major impact is on prices of crude oil, which has a bearing on almost everything else.

Brent futures, a global benchmark for crude oil prices, spiked to almost $120 a barrel this week as the market restricted purchases of Russian crude oil and scrambled to source other grades.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which controls the majority of global oil production, expressed unwillingness to ease the tight oil markets and maintained its targeted monthly production increase of 400,000 barrels/day for April even after the disruption to Russian supplies.

Experts said the $125/barrel level could be breached sooner than later. Some said crude will soon touch a new decadal high, with a telling impact on the global economy.

Kotak Institutional Equities, in its latest report, said it expects “oil prices to remain on an uptrend over the near term” due to the uncertainty that the oil markets face from further escalation of the conflict; lower exports of Russian crude and petroleum products in anticipation of sanctions by the US and its allies, and the lack of incremental supply to ease a tight market.

“An easing of sanctions on Iran or a significant further release of emergency oil reserves by the IEA (International Energy Agency) is likely to be the only respite to elevated crude oil prices,” Kotak said in the report.

Sectors directly dependent on crude oil and its derivatives will be the biggest losers and the paint industry is one of them.

Raw material costs

The sector, which was already reeling under the impact of subdued demand because of the pandemic, is once again in troubled waters. Crude oil prices affect the decorative paint business more than any other because it is a raw material-intensive industry. The manufacture of paint requires more than 300 items, most being petroleum-based. Rising crude oil rates also increase the cost of producing items such as titanium dioxide, a key ingredient for white paint.

Raw material accounts for 55-60 percent of input costs and directly impacts gross margins. Indian paint companies increased prices several times in the past few months but they were not enough to offset higher raw material costs.

Asian Paints, India’s largest paint company, had highlighted during its third quarter earnings call that the current input cost inflation was unprecedented in 40 years. The current crisis will further aggravate the situation.

The paint industry also uses tinplate extensively for packaging its products. The industry already faced a supply crunch for this metal due to disruptions after the pandemic including congestion at ports and unavailability of containers. This pushed up packaging costs significantly in the past few quarters.

The Ukraine crisis has resulted in a sharp uptick in metal prices. Although this benefits metals, it can wreak havoc on already pressurised margins in sectors like paints.

ICICI Securities, which recently had an interaction with paint dealers, said “the dealers indicated that revenue growth has slowed down after Diwali and consumer offtake has remained soft even in Jan-Feb ’22 due to the impact of price hike, examination season and election in local markets.”

Price hikes not enough

Paint companies have been trying to pass on higher input costs to consumers through calibrated hikes. Prices are 22 percent higher year on year and the next increase is expected in April.

“The prices of wood finish are hiked by ~8 percent from March 1 by paint companies. If paint companies plan to hike prices in April, there will be some inventory uploading in March,” ICICI Securities said in a note.

However, the rate of price hikes has not been able to match the rise in input costs as volumes may get impacted, continuing to pinch margins.

India’s GDP grew at a less-than-expected 5.4 percent in the third quarter (October-December) and the estimate for FY22 was revised downwards to 8.9 percent. The data reflected lower-than-expected growth in consumption and signs of a slowdown in the rural economy.

“Strong government spending was not adequate to compensate for softer prints in case of manufacturing, construction and agriculture,” said Siddhartha Sanyal, chief economist at Bandhan Bank. He expects the current geopolitical scenario and rising commodity prices to create more headwinds in the current quarter.

Paint companies are trying to cushion themselves from the vagaries of crude prices by diversifying into products such as building chemicals, adhesives, wall putties and wood polish finishes. These products, distributed through their existing network, contribute less than 10 percent to revenue but help companies in the decorative segment to offer more home decor solutions.

“Asian Paints and Berger Paints continue to gain market share in putty and primers from smaller players as the supply chain of larger players is better than smaller players,” ICICI Securities said in a report.

Companies including Asian Paints have entered the home décor/home improvement space in a big way and are witnessing good results, as was highlighted on the company’s earnings call.

Outlook

Due to lockdowns and restrictions in Q1 of FY21 and Q1 of FY22, the waterproofing market was impacted. It is expected to rebound in the next quarter before the arrival of the June-September monsoon.

Experts had hoped for a demand revival in the paint segment in Q1 of FY23 but in the wake of the current scenario and impending price hikes, that estimate might get pushed further. The duration of the conflict and the impact of sanctions on Russia and its crude oil supply will play a crucial role in the turnaround for the paint industry.",939,-0.5167591742106846

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian Paints

We increase our FY22/FY23/FY24 EPS by 13.6%/7%/3.2% given 1) strong pent-up demand 2) long runway for growth in Rurban India 3) bounce back in metro/Tier1/2 demand and 4) strong traction in project business. We believe long term structural levers remain intact led by 1) Market share gains in decorative paints from both organized & unorganized players 2) Increased distribution with addition of 45k+ retail points. 3) Innovations & focus on high growth waterproofing/ construction aids segment 4) Ramp up in Kitchen & Bath business (PBT breakeven in 3Q) and 5) Huge potential in contribution of new verticals of home décor (10%) and Services (7-8%) in 2-3 years. APNT reported sequential improvement in margins on the back of 15% pricing action and superior mix led by strong growth in Metros/Tier1/2 cities. APNT remains confident of sustained improvement as 4Q on positive demand outlook and full impact of price hikes. APNT continues to remain a strong structural play given 1) double digit decorative paints Industry growth 2) innovation and marketing to ensure sustained leadership position and 3) scale up in emerging segments.

Outlook

We expect APNT to sustain premium valuations given strong growth visibility. We maintain BUY with a TP of Rs 3762 (Rs 3675 earlier). Any structural margin correction post Grasim’s entry in Decorative paints is a risk to our call.

Catch all the market action on our live blog

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after its December quarter earnings:

Nomura

Foreign research house Nomura has maintained a 'buy' call and raised target to Rs 3,875 from Rs 3,550 as it expect strong demand to continue and margin to get better.

The third quarter was a beat on volume/value, while margin misses. The company delivered Q3 volume/value growth of +18 percent/+26 percent, YoY.

The management does not expect any meaningful impact on volume growth. The growth is driven by higher demand in metros, Tier-1 and 2 markets and strong sales growth is likely to continue, aided by share gains in new/niche categories.

Nomura expects margin pressure to abate on the back of price increases. It lowered the FY22 EPS by 3 percent to factor in Q3 margin miss.

The broking firm raises the FY23 and FY24 EPS by 4 percent each to factor in strong volume/value growth and margin improvement.

Credit Suisse

The research firm has kept 'outperform' call on the stock and raised the target price to Rs 3,700 from Rs 3,500.

It increased the FY22-24 earnings by 3 percent and expects a greater margin recovery in Q4.

Jefferies

The broking firm kept the 'underperform' rating on the stock with a target at Rs 2,700 on the back of an impressive Q3 with 18 percent volume growth in India decorative business.

The base has no consequence here as 2-year and 3-year CAGR is even higher. There has been strong growth momentum despite highest-ever product price hike, it added.

The structural story on paints is strong & company best in class.

Prabhudas Lilladher

We increase our FY22/FY23/FY24 EPS by 13.6 percent/7 percent/3.2 percent, given (1) strong pent-up demand, (2) long runway for growth in Rurban India, (3) bounce back in metro/Tier1/2 demand, and (4) strong traction in project business.

""We expect the company to sustain premium valuations given strong growth visibility. We maintain buy with a target price of Rs 3,762 (Rs 3,675 earlier). Any structural margin correction post Grasim’s entry in Decorative paints is a risk to our call.

Motilal Oswal

The miss on earnings has led to a 9.8 percent cut in FY22 EPS, but there have been no material changes in our FY23 and FY24 EPS estimates.

While sales growth was impressive in 3QFY22, even on a reasonably high base of the previous year, it remains to be seen how the company will fare on the demand front in subsequent quarters – especially as (a) festive demand drivers would no longer be at play and (b) the sales growth base is even more challenging going forward.

The valuations are expensive at 66x/57x FY23E/FY24E EPS. We maintain our neutral rating, with target price of Rs 3,500 on 60x Mar’24E EPS, which leaves little room for an upside.

At 9:32am, Asian Paints was quoting at Rs 3,309.85, up Rs 2.15, or 0.07 percent, on the BSE.

However, the momentum indicator like RSI (relative strength index) is sustaining above 60 mark on all the time frames which indicate market has strong positive momentum for the medium to long term.

We believe, the Nifty will face strong resistance at 18,210 and 18,604 mark. On the flip side, the support levels would be placed at 17,380 and 16,830 levels.

Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

It recently found support at the Rs 235 mark which is the lower end of this channel and is now heading towards the higher end of the channel which is near to Rs 400 mark.

Investors should, therefore, keep holding long positions in the stock while traders should adopt the 'buy on dips' strategy.

Siemens

Siemens has been one of the strongest performers from the F&O space and is trading in an uptrend. During the recent session, it has made a new life high which indicates further strength.

Going ahead, we expect the stock to rise towards Rs 3,000 and beyond. Investors should keep holding the stock with a trailing stop loss of Rs 2,000, while traders should wait for a dip to go fresh long.

Asian Paints

Asian Paints recently confirmed a bearish head-and-shoulder pattern breakdown but it failed and the stock moved up. Such kind of pattern failure is followed by a strong contra move and that has already started for Asian Paints.

Going ahead, the stock could be heading towards Rs 3,600 mark and hence investors should hold the stock for some more time. Traders who are willing to go fresh long should follow a strict stop loss of Rs 3,180.

Thermax

During the recent session, Thermax confirmed a breakout from bullish penant formation and that too at its all-time high. This indicates strength and the pattern target is around Rs 2,300. Therefore, the stock is poised for further upside.

Traders can go for fresh long at the current price with a stop loss of Rs 1,680 for the mentioned target, while investors should keep holding the stock in their portfolio.

The paints industry in India has been grappling with inflationary pressures on raw materials for the past few months. The rise in crude prices and Titanium Dioxide (it constitutes ~20percent of raw material cost), had their biggest toll on the margins of the paints companies in the last four decades. The situation was more perilous for unorganized players which lack muscle power to negotiate the raw material prices.

However, things have now started looking up for the sector on the back of price hikes implemented by the companies in the second and third quarter of this fiscal and also raw material prices are witnessing some softness which will help improve the margins for all players.

Paints Industry

The Indian paint industry grew at a CAGR of 11 percent over FY11-FY19. Decorative paints, which, is the largest segment within the paints industry constitutes about 74 percent of total paint sales. Decorative paints segment is immune to the industrial slowdown to a large extent which has helped the paint sector grow at a robust rate.

April and May are the two key months for re-painting activities in the domestic market generating ~25 percent of total annual paint sales in the country. Unfortunately, FY21 was affected by the pandemic, led by lockdown, resulting in almost no business in Q1FY21 and the business in Q1FY22 got impacted by the second wave. However, a faster recovery was seen from Q2FY22 which boosted the sentiments.

Demand Growth

The paints industry is expected to post robust volume growth led by demand from repainting and new construction. Strong festive demand coupled with good monsoon aided the growth in repainting segment in both urban and rural areas. Further, “anticipated growth in construction activity over the next five years creates opportunity for fresh painting”, said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities. Acceptance of better paint products in smaller towns, and upgradation to premium brands in cities and large towns will enable the value growth, he added.

Kotak Institutional Equities said that the demand for decorative paints has been witnessing strong traction over the past four quarters. This is led by strong demand across urban and rural markets, continued share gains of organized players from unorganized, further accelerated by RM pressure impacting price competitiveness of smaller players (largely economy-end portfolio), and good growth in adjacent categories (waterproofing, wood finish).

Adjacent categories – New trigger for growth

Paint companies are aiming to make waterproofing as default product with paints. “We expect all paint companies to enjoy high double-digit penetration led revenue growth in this category”, said IDBI Capital in its report. This category is significantly under-penetrated and unexploited. “Overall size for water proofing industry stands at 15-20percent of paint industry (at Rs 6,000 crore) and is growing at faster rate compared to paints” added the brokerage.

The technology involved in producing water-proofing products and its business economics is very much similar to paints. Hence, this does not require any significant resources from paints companies and can be sold through their existing distribution channels.

However, the nature of this category creates some amount of entry barriers for new players. This is due to the fact that, “water-proofing products doesn’t sell due to better advertisements but on quality of solution being offered, skill-sets imparted to the contractor and warranty given on the products”, IDBI Capital said. To be sure, Pidilite runs Dr. Fixit academy for training contractors on waterproofing.

Inflationary Issues to be mitigated by calibrated price hikes

Input prices (crude oil & derivatives, TiO2 and packaging material) have risen 40-50percent in past 12 months. “Crude prices affect the decorative paints business more than any other as it is a raw material intensive industry with more than 300 materials needed to manufacturer paints, most of which are petroleum based”, added Jasani of HDFC Securities. It may be noted that raw materials constitute ~55-60percent of total costs. Additionally, due to disruptions in supply chain, there has been a shortage of tinplates required for making paint cans, which has lead to sharp uptick in paint packaging costs.

To counter these inflationary trends in raw material costs, the paint companies have taken two rounds of calibrated price hikes post the festive season. Asian Paints, the market leader, hiked its prices by 9-10percent from Nov 12, 2021 and there was an additional price increase of 4-5percent from Dec 5, 2021. Cumulative price increase taken by the company since April 2021 stands at 21-22percent.

Berger Paints, the second largest player, has also taken year to date price hikes of ~18percent-19percent.

“This price increase should almost fully mitigate gross margin pressure starting 4QFY22 and drive swift recovery in profitability for the industry”, said Kotak.

“While we note paint companies have initiated corrective actions such as price hikes, cost-saving initiatives and are focusing on sourcing & formulation efficiencies, we believe some impact on profitability in FY22 and H1FY23 is unavoidable”, said ICICI Securities in its report.

Recently witnessed stability and reduction in crude prices may bode well for paint companies hoping to restore margins to last year’s levels by March 2022, added Jasani.

The industry had faced a trend in FY08-10, when most input prices had increased by 40-60percent in FY09 over FY08. “The profitability had declined sharply in FY09 but swiftly recovered in FY10 due to price hikes, cost-saving initiatives and some correction in input prices”, added ICICI Securities.

Entry of New Players

The recent entry of large business houses like Grasim and JSW is now heating up the Indian paints industry with competition set to intensify. However, business economics is expected to remain strong.

“Better quality product, cheaper price and superior incentive to dealers are the three levers that had always been used by new players to compete”, said IDBI Capital in its report. However, historically we do not see these levers to have any meaningful impact on market share loss for the leaders, the brokerage added.

The profit pool of the paints industry is likely to shrink in FY22-23 as market leaders will protect their volumes and market shares even at the cost of profitability for some quarters as a signal to new entrants, said ICICI Securities.

Asian Paints dominates the profit pool of the industry. If it takes a hit on its margins then in all likelihood, the no.2 and no.3 players will also forgo some profitability resulting in the industry profit pool to decline. It will act as a signal to the new competitors like Grasim and JSW that the incumbents will protect volumes/ market shares even at the cost of profitability.

As time progresses, the paints sector will continue to generate interest as it will be interesting to see how the new players will unfold their strategies to take on the already established players.",1159,0.2726742625236511

“We saw a lot of inflow in the first half of the year due to various reasons. Hence, valuation correction is on cards, and we expect the Nifty 50 to either be rangebound or correct 1,000 points until the Budget,” Bhatia said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

The rally that Indian shares saw in the first half of the year was because the market had already priced in a recovery in economic growth and that benefitted all sectors, including airlines and tourism.

“So, any negative news related to the Omicron variant of COVID-19 or negative growth would warrant a correction in the market,” he said.

The Nifty has risen more than 22 percent year-to-date despite the second wave of COVID-19, which caused a severe healthcare crisis in the country.

“In emerging markets, India is at the peak in terms of valuations, and there are better plays elsewhere,” Bhatia said. If the US Fed taper gathers momentum in the first two quarters of the next year, then all emerging markets would see outflows, he said.

Bhatia, however, said there are plenty of investment opportunities in select stocks and sectors. He is bullish on ICICI Bank, Infosys, and NTPC. He also likes Asian Paints and believes easing commodity prices will benefit the paint-maker.

He is also upbeat on the real estate sector, which he said will see a longer-term uptick, especially because it has seen a robust recovery after almost a decade.

“Real estate prices and volumes have gone up and price and time correction has made property more affordable. Hence, this is one sector that should see continued interest,” he said.

He expects India to benefit from the trends in the healthcare space, as it has become a structural long-term theme globally.

He is cautious on the auto sector and said one should wait and watch how the semiconductor shortage evolves over the next six months. While he expects the shortage to resolve by June-July, geopolitical tensions in Taiwan, world’s chip factory, could play a spoilsport.

“We want to see how Maruti Suzuki responds since the company has said it will not entirely focus on electric vehicles but continue to focus on hybrids and gasoline engines as well… It needs to be watched to understand the underlying changes in the auto industry,” he said.

And even as several new economy players debut on Dalal Street, Bhatia is wary of the “frothy” valuations in recent listings. He said Macquarie is cautious on Paytm, and the brokerage had initiated coverage on the digital payments platform with an “underperform” rating ahead of its listing. “We believe Paytm’s business model lacks focus and direction,” it had said in a note.

(Illustration by Suneesh Kalarickal)

Brands that brought comfort and convenience to consumers in their everyday lives during the Covid-19 pandemic emerged as the most purposeful brands, according to a recent study by consulting company Kantar.

According to Kantar BrandZ data, consumers said that these brands led with a clear sense of purpose and took a bolder social stance, as Covid-19 magnified the need for brands to do more than focus on profits alone. The findings tie in with longer-term trends in India and abroad to value brands on ESG (environmental, social and governance) alongside traditional factors, such as valuations and earnings growth.

E-commerce giant Amazon emerged as the most purposeful brand in the technology category. The technology ranking has Amazon followed by Zomato, YouTube, Google and Swiggy jointly in fourth place, followed by Flipkart.

Noting that technology is all encompassing, Deepender Rana, executive managing director- South Asia, Insights Division, Kantar, said that brands that made lives easier for consumers using technology when they were stuck at home fared well.

""....It could include e-commerce brands, food delivery brands (Zomato and Swiggy), entertainment platforms (video streaming platforms such as Amazon Prime Video), even brands that brought information such as Google. The service providers also featured on the list including telecom brands. They played to convenience while keeping consumers safe, entertained and connected,"" he notes.

Although Asian Paints is the winner, the non-FMCG ranking is dominated by telecom brands, with Samsung and Jio jointly second, followed by MRF, Tata Housing and Airtel.

Tata Tea emerged as the most purposeful leaders in India in the FMCG category that also ranks firms such as Surf Excel and Taj Mahal along with Parachute and Maggi both in fourth position and Britannia completing the list.

Kantar says that brand value derives from three core pillars of growth: meaningfulness, difference and salience. While the fundamentals of brand-building remain the same, what has changed is the expectation that the brand will stand for something more. Kantar conducted an analysis of 418 brands across 30 categories and found that in India especially, perceptions of a brand’s purpose, its ability to ‘make people’s lives better,’ is crucial to establishing a brand’s Meaningful quotient and thus, boosting prospects for growth.

Rana highlighted that 'purpose' as a contributor to brand equity is 10 times more important in India, in comparison to globally. This shows that a larger societal purpose is even more critical to success for brands in India.

""Of course, vague slogans and one-off ‘corporate charity’ events do not work, and it is not about jumping on the bandwagon of the latest fashionable cause either. Instead, real Purpose flows from, and builds on, a brand’s existing core values and DNA. This reinforces the need to understand and measure if a brand’s Purpose is perceived as adding real meaning to consumers' lives,"" he adds.

Some of the key patterns in what Indian consumers deemed ‘Purposeful’ in 2021 include amplifying or communicating purpose is critical. Tech brands show how everyday convenience contributes to brand purpose. These brands have been able to scale-up and showcase a wide range of products plus enter new categories at a time when consumers were desperate for at-home and delivery solutions.

Everyday convenience in turn made lives easier and fuelled saliency for brands. FMCG brands are focusing on reducing their carbon footprint and taking a social stance. FMCG brands that score high on brand purpose have shown that purpose and profit can go hand-in-hand. They are working to reduce their environmental impact and promote social causes - which in turn attract customers, partners, and talent.

Non-FMCG brands are now adopting marketing strategies that promote the brand in ways that look beyond the function of product or service; the key is to do more than just meeting consumers’ immediate needs, adding new and potentially differentiating associations.

The Indian consumer, on a par with many of their Asian counterparts are actively engaging with sustainability; 77% are prepared to invest time and money in companies that try to do good.

Soumya Mohanty, managing director- client and quantitative, Insights Division, Kantar stated, “Globally, purpose doesn’t drive relevance to the extent it drives it in India. Purpose also drives salience and hence India is a salience driven market.”",741,0.9077735722064972

A report by the Business Standard said that Ingovern observed several related party transactions between Asian Paints and Paladin Paints & Chemicals, a private company owned by the Dani family, who are also promoters of Asian Paints.

Ingovern has reportedly highlighted the likely conflict of interest involving entities controlled by the Danis, which also supply raw material to the paint manufacturer.

According to a report by The Hindu Business Line, Ingovern has also sought the removal of promoters Ashwin Dani and his son Malav Dani from the board.

The markets regulator SEBI is already investigating transactions involving Paladin Paints and Chemicals, the report said.

“On October 24, APL put out an innocuous clarification to a news report. We dug deep. APL’s FY15-16 annual report lists PPCL as a related party from April 22, 2015. But APL, unlike most other companies, ‘does not list out’ the value of RPTs. Only an aggregate value is given. APL needs to present RPT details with each of the promoter-controlled entities, including PPCL, in terms of transaction value, nature of trade..."" the report said quoting Ingovern.

“Promoter directors who ‘control’ entities supplying goods to APL should immediately resign,” Ingovern reportedly said in a note.

The latest development comes a month after a whistleblower flagged off related party transactions by the promoters of Asian Paints.

On November 25, the company issued a clarification to the stock exchanges in response to the two news articles quoted above and said there was ""certain factually incorrect"" information in the Ingovern report.

It said the claim that Paladin formed 7 percent of the value of goods purchased from promoter-controlled entities is factually incorrect.

Asian Paints has hiked its prices by 4-5 percent close on the heels of a record 7-10 percent increase, dealers of the company told Moneycontrol.

“The company has increased the price by 10 percent from December but, due to various schemes, the effective rise would be only 4-5 percent,” said one of the dealers.

The company confirmed the move but refused to disclose the quantum of price hikes taken.

Paint companies such as Asian Paints and Berger Paints India had increased prices effective from November in their highest-ever increase to offset the impact of rising inputs costs because of input cost inflation.

Brokerages had reported that Asian Paints had increased prices of its products by 7-9 percent in November, while Berger Paints had raised the prices in high single digits. Asian Paints has taken an overall hike of 19 percent this financial year so far, according to Edelweiss.

While another paint company, Akzo Nobel India, had taken a cumulative price hike of 14 percent in the first half of FY21 and might raise the prices further going ahead, said ICICI Securities said in a note.

Other paint companies might follow suit and increase prices further, said Edelweiss, after the market leader Asian Paints’ move.

Margins under pressure

Paint companies have been battling high inputs costs for more than a year now, which has impacted their margins.

In the second quarter of the financial year 2022, Asian Paints had a 34 percent volume growth on a base of 11 percent but the EBITDA and gross margins dipped 900-1,000 basis points each. Asian Paints’ profitability had been significantly impacted by the steep material inflation leading to PBT (profit before tax) losses, according to CEO and Managing Director Amit Syngle.

While addressing investors after reporting the second-quarter results earlier this month, Syngle had said that steep inflation seen in raw material prices, since the beginning of this calendar year, has been phenomenal and has impacted gross margins across all businesses in the quarter.

“The Q2 PBT loss was at Rs 17 crore and H1 (first half of FY22 PBT loss at Rs 28 crore),” he said.

The price hikes, however, are expected to ease the pressure on the company’s margins in the quarter ahead. “Asian Paints has a clear strategy of being proactive in price hikes to expand margins on quarter-on-quarter basis unlike in Q2FY22 when its margins were at a multi-year low,” said Abneesh Roy, Executive Director, Edelweiss Securities.

“We continue to expect that in Q4FY22, Asian Paints will be back to 18-20 percent EBITDA margin, Q3FY22 is also likely to be much better than Q2FY22,” he said.

He, however, warned that the company’s volume growth might be impacted if it does not offer rebates.

Inflationary push

Most consumer goods companies have witnessed unprecedented rise in raw material costs in the past year. “We have never seen such inflation levels like this, going from 20-22 percent. And it is all across, not only in crude but also in titanium, monomers, additives, and in a lot of other raw materials,” Syngle told the investors.

According to analysts, edible oil prices have climbed 35-50 percent year-on-year (YoY), while that of crude derivatives, a key material for paint companies, has jumped 30 percent. Crude derivatives, according to analysts, contribute 55 percent of raw material costs of paint companies.

The quarter ahead might not offer much of a relief, though. “We will have to live with inflation for some time. There doesn’t seem to be any reprieve now. We are just hoping that we should not see another bout of the increase going ahead,” Syngle said.",641,-0.11561590433120728

The market seems to have witnessed profit-booking after a day of rebound, and fell a third of a percent on October 27, dragged by private banks, metals and auto stocks. However, IT, pharma, PSU bank and FMCG stocks offered support.

The Nifty50 shed 57 points to close at 18,211 mark, and The BSE Sensex was down 207 points at 61,143.33, while the broader markets outpaced frontliners as the Nifty Midcap 100 index rose 0.08 percent and Smallcap 100 index gained 0.27 percent.

Stocks that were in focus include Asian Paints, which rallied 4.2 percent to close at Rs 3,094.65 and was the biggest gainer in the BSE Sensex after a price hike of products. Godrej Consumer Products continued its run for the second consecutive session, rising 4.76 percent to Rs 1,009.90, which was the second biggest gainer in the F&O segment.

Private sector lender Axis Bank was the biggest loser in the BSE Sensex and F&O segment, falling 6.46 percent to close at Rs 787.50 after the September quarter earnings.

Here's what Gaurav Sharma of Globe Capital Markets, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Asian Paints

The stock is bouncing back after testing its 200 EMA (exponential moving average) placed around Rs 2,856 levels. This is a positive sign as that moving average will limit its downside movement.

Overall, the stock is in a strong uptrend and is now available after some profit-taking from higher levels. This provides good opportunity for investors to accumulate the stock.

The ongoing festive season is also a positive and will impact its next quarterly numbers. Hence, we advocate taking long positions for an immediate target of Rs 3,400, while Rs 3,700-plus is also a reasonable target for the medium to long term.

Godrej Consumer Products

This stock has underperformed the benchmark in the recent past, which is not an exception as the majority of FMCG stocks saw profit-taking in the past couple of weeks, especially after Hindustan Uniliver's numbers. Technically, this profit-taking should be considered a healthy sign as it gives traders an opportunity to take fresh long positions.

We see the stock heading towards Rs 1,060-1,120 levels in the immediate near term. Sustenance above that mark will open the gates for a further up move till Rs 1,200 and beyond. Traders are advised to keep a stop loss below Rs 900.

Axis Bank

On October 27, the stock witnessed steep selloff, which was a reaction after the quarterly numbers were announced. Prior to this, it was in a strong up trend, poised to scale higher. We still see the bullish trend intact till Rs 720 is held on the downside.

Hence, medium to long term traders are advised to utilise the ongoing profit-taking to accumulate the stock for targets close to Rs 1,000.

Asian Paints share price added nearly 6 percent in the morning trade on October 27 after the company hiked prices by 7-10 percent.

Asian Paints increased by 10 percent prices across product portfolio except for enamels (6-7 percent price hike); blended price increase at the portfolio level is 8-9 percent, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report citing dealer interactions. The new prices will be effective from November 12, it said.

On October 21, the company reported a 29 percent year-on-year decline in consolidated profit at Rs 605.2 crore for the quarter ended September 2021, as higher input prices dented operating income, missing analysts' expectations.

Higher sales volumes pushed consolidated revenue growth higher than expected at 32.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 7,096 crore.

Nomura

The research firm said the channel checks indicate a price hike of 9 percent across portfolios, which is higher than its cumulative hike over the last six months (7.5 percent in H1FY22).

With a sharp price hike, expect the margin gap to be materially bridged, while the company will require a 5 percent additional price increase to fully bridge the gap.

Macquarie

The company has announced the price hike with Rs 3 per litre across entry-level distempers and Rs 12 per litre across enamels.

Paint companies Asian Paints and Berger Paints have taken high-single-digit price increases across their portfolio in a move to offset the rising inputs costs, brokerages reported on Wednesday. This is the sharpest price increase ever taken by these companies.

According to Kotak Institutional Equities, Asian Paints, the market leader in the decorative paints segment, has hiked the prices by 7-10 percent, effective from November 12. While Berger Paints also has hiked

prices by high-single digits, said Edelweiss adding that other companies might follow suit soon.

“Asian Paints has taken a price increase of 10 percent across product portfolio except for enamels (6-7 percent price hike); blended price increase at the portfolio level is 8-9 percent,” said a note from Kotak Institutional Equities.

Another brokerage Nomura, too, reported the development. “Channel checks indicate Asian Paints announced aggressive 9 percent price hike

(confirmed by the company) across portfolios and key brands effective November 12 (post-Diwali),” it said.

This increase is higher than its cumulative price increases over the past 6 months (7.5 percent over 1H22) and the highest price hike in one go since 2008, said the brokerage.

Margins dented

Paint companies have been battling high inputs costs on account of rising inflation for more than a year now, which has impacted their margins.

Amit Syngle, CEO and managing director, Asian Paints, while addressing investors after reporting the second-quarter results earlier this month had said that steep inflation seen in raw material prices, since the beginning of this calendar year, has been phenomenal and has impacted gross margins across all businesses in the quarter.

In the second quarter of the financial year 2022, Asian Paints had a 34 percent volume growth on a base of 11 percent but EBITDA and gross margins dipped 900-1000 basis points each.

Asian Paints’ profitability had been significantly impacted by the steep material inflation leading to PBT (profit before tax) loss, said Syngle. “Q2 PBT loss was at Rs. 17 crores and H1 (first half of FY22 PBT loss at Rs. 28 crores),” he added.

However, the price hikes by the company, indicate brokerages, is likely to offset the rising input costs and ease the pressure on their margins.

“With this sharp price increase we expect Asian Paint’s margin gap to be materially bridged and will require only 5 percent additional price increase (ceteris paribus) to fully bridge the gap,” said Nomura.

Abneesh Roy, executive director, Edelweiss Securities said this very sharp increase shows Asian Paints has taken feedback from investors to have a more balanced approach to growth with a focus on both volume growth and margins.

Sky-high inflation

Most consumer goods companies have witnessed unprecedented inflation in several key raw materials in the past year. According to analysts, the prices of key input products such as edible oil including palm oil, crude-linked derivatives as well as agri-commodities have soared since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. On top of this, the companies are also grappling with rising freight costs as fuel prices reach a skyrocketing level in the country.

“We have never seen inflation levels like this, going from 20-22 percent kind of level. And it is all across, not only in crude but across in titanium, in monomers, in additives, in terms of a lot of other raw materials,” said Syngle while addressing the investors.

According to analysts, edible oil prices have climbed by 35-50 percent year-on-year (YoY), while that of crude derivatives, a key material for paint companies, has jumped by 30 percent YoY. Crude derivatives, according to analysts, contribute 55 percent of raw material costs of paint companies.

The quarter ahead might not offer much of a relief to paint companies.

“We will have to live with inflation for some time. There doesn’t seem to be any reprieve now, we are just hoping that we should not see another bout of the increase going ahead,” added Syngle.",655,0.0014541983604431153

Emkay Global Financial's report on Asian Paints

APNT reported a big earnings miss (33% below estimates) due to a sharp fall in margins. Gross and operating margins fell ~10ppts due to the steep rise in input costs and slower price increases. Growth momentum was stronger as sales rose 33% (9% beat). In order to improve margins, management plans to expedite price increases and focus on formulation efficiencies. APNT expects margins to return to the normal range of 18-20% by Q4. We hence trim our margin forecasts from ~22% to 18.3%/19.8% for FY23/24. Growth momentum remained robust as APNT significantly outpaced most consumer peers in volume/sales growth. Bullish commentary, aggressive initiatives on portfolio and distribution expansion and revival in construction/industrial demand offer a strong outlook.

Outlook

With input inflation getting back to the peak, FY21 margins appear challenging. We raise sales estimates by 6%, factoring in the strong growth momentum, but reduce margin assumptions. As a result, we cut earnings estimates by 23%/13%/7% for FY22/23/24. Retain Hold with a revised TP of Rs2,800 (Rs2,960 earlier) based on 55x Dec'23E EPS.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Asian Paints

While the sales growth trend was healthy and the outlook remains positive, the lowest EBITDA margins in 50 quarters led to a ~38% miss on our forecasts at the EBITDA and PAT levels. The management stated that material cost inflation was the highest in four decades, and it expects this trend to persist over the near term. Further price hikes (in addition to a 4% increase in 2QFY22 and 3.5% increase in 1QFY22), cost savings, and raw material substitution could mitigate the sequential impact going forward. While the demand outlook remains strong, the company is also confronted with a higher base in 2HFY22, with sales growth of 25.2%/43.5% in 3QFY21/4QFY21. The company's focus on topline growth and ensuing market share gains would lead to healthy earnings over the medium-to-long term. Nonetheless, earnings for the next few quarters would be affected by intense margin pressure. We maintain our Neutral rating.



Outlook

Valuations are expensive at 69x FY23E EPS. We maintain our Neutral rating, with TP of INR2,930 on 60x Dec'23 EPS.

Asian Paints share price was under pressure on October 25 after reports said a whistleblower had flagged related-party transactions done by the paintmaker’s promoters that allegedly benefited them at the cost of shareholders.

The stock has shed over 9 percent in the last five days and was trading at Rs 2,941.55, down Rs 43.10, or 1.44 percent at 11.27 am. It touched an intraday high of Rs 2,949.45 and an intraday low of Rs 2,855.60.

The whistleblower told the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) that money to buy Paladin Paints and Chemicals went from Asian Paints but its promoters Ashwin Dani and son Malav now controlled the company in their personal capacity, a CNBC-TV18 report said.

SEBI has reportedly sought details from the whistleblower.

“The said complaint was investigated in accordance with the Company’s Whistle Blower Policy, and after undertaking a detailed review of the transactions which were mentioned therein, the said complaint was closed as the enquiry concluded that the transactions were undertaken in compliance with the law, and there was no basis for the allegations made,” Asian Paints told In a the exchanges.

The company said it had entered into a technical consultancy agreement with Jayram Nadkarni, a former employee of Asian Paints, and Paladin Paints and Chemicals during the financial year 2005–2006.

The paints company, despite an impressive growth in revenue, has seen a sharp drop in profits because of higher raw material costs, leaving investors worried.

The company on October 21 reported a 29 percent year-on-year decline in consolidated profit at Rs 605.2 crore for the quarter ended September 2021 as higher input prices dented operating income, missing analysts’ expectation.

Consolidated revenue during the quarter grew 32.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 7,096 crore, which came in higher than analysts' expectations due to higher sales volumes.

Yes Securities | Q3 outlook looks positive

According to a report by Yes Securities, the third quarter outlook looks positive in the festival period with consumer confidence strong. Good monsoon augurs well for rural demand, uptick in housing construction and industrial demand.

A third wave looks remote. With persisting raw material inflation, a further price hike was imminent, target to cover large part of inflation over the next three months through a combination of aggressive price hikes, formulation efficiencies and cost controls. There were some concerns in international markets, especially Africa.

Elara Capital | Rating: Accumulate | Target: Rs 3,250

The research firm has an “accumulate” rating on the stock, with a price target of Rs 3,250 a share. It is of the view that Asian Paints is assertively driving growth, gaining market share from unorganised players and expanding offerings to emerge as a complete home décor company.

""We recommend accumulate as we assign 64x P/E (1STD above its five-year average P/E) to arrive at a target of Rs 3,250 on September 2023E EPS of Rs 50.8. Key upside risk is higher-than estimated revenue growth and downside risk is lower-than-estimated EBITDA margin,"" it added.

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 2,930

Research and broking firm Motilal Oswal has a neutral call on the stock with target of Rs 2,930 a share. According to its report, the big miss on the results has led to a 22.7 percent/7 percent cut in our FY22E/FY23E EPS.

While sales growth has been impressive, the challenging base ahead for 2HFY22 and persistent material cost pressures would significantly impact earnings growth over the next few quarters.

""Valuations are expensive at 69x FY23E EPS. We maintain our neutral rating, with target of Rs 2,930 on 60x Dec’23 EPS,"" it said.

Axis Securities | Rating: Buy | Target: Cut to Rs 3,300

Axis Securities has maintained a “buy” call on the stock, with the target at Rs 3,300 a share.

Asian Paints remains upbeat on the sustenance of demand on the back of a recovery in Tier 1 and 2, urban centres, expanding distribution footprint (added 40k retail points in the last 18 months), good monsoon, upgrade to emulsion at the bottom of the pyramid and healthy festival season-led demand, a report said.

Market share gains from both organised as well unorganised players continued to be reported by ANPT. Beautiful Home Services gained improved traction with the kitchen and bath business achieving break-even at the EBTIDA level.

The international business reported healthy performance and is expected to continue. However, to bake in the high inflationary environment, our FY22E see a sharp downgrade, while FY23E/24E estimates for EBITDA/PAT are lower by 8.9 percent/9.6 and 6.7 percent/7.1 percent, respectively.

""The long-term structural story remains intact, with drivers such as clear focus on driving volumes and profitability, improved traction in other adjacent business segments, market share gains, and huge growth opportunities in the rural and small towns. Even as we continue to value the stock at 57x FY24E EPS our target undergoes a downward revision to Rs 3,300 per share from Rs 3,510 earlier,"" it added.

Emkay Global | Rating: Hold | Target: Cut to Rs 2,800

Emkay Global Financial Services has a “hold” rating on the stock with the target at Rs 2,800 a share.

""With input inflation getting back to the peak, FY21 margins appear challenging. We raise sales estimates by 6 percent, factoring in the strong growth momentum, but reduce margin assumptions.

He further said Asian Paints has taken a series of price increases and would look at further price increase to mitigate the impact of this persistently high inflation and is confident that it should be able to turn this around strongly in the coming quarter.

Asian Paints, one of the largest paint companies in India, is expected to see more than 20 percent growth in sales volume for the quarter ended September 2021 due to a pent-up demand in rural as well as urban areas and market share gains, which ultimately could boost revenue for the quarter.

The stock registered 25 percent gains since the start of financial year FY22 and gained 6-odd percent from July. Now, whether the stock can extend gains post earnings or could be hit by expected margin pressure, will be watched out closely.

""We expect 34 percent and 30 percent YoY growth in volumes and value respectively in domestic decorative paints aided by (1) some pent-up demand, (2) share gains from unorganised players as well as organised players and (3) strong growth momentum in waterproofing,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities. ""We expect 5.7 percent YoY growth in subsidiary revenues.""

Sharekhan said pent-up demand and recovery in the real estate sector will help Asian Paints to clock volume growth of above 20 percent in Q2FY22. ""The company may continue to post market share gains in key markets.""

KRChoksey Research expects international revenues (around 12-13 percent of revenue) to remain subdued due to global supply chain disruption and lesser demand in foreign countries.

Profit for the quarter is likely to see a 6-12 percent growth due to pressure in margin on account of higher input prices. Experts largely expect around 500 bps YoY contraction in gross margin as the Brent crude prices increased to $78.52 a barrel from $75.13 a barrel during the quarter and gained more than 30 percent since the start of FY22, though the company has taken a price hike in first half of FY22. 100 basis points is one percentage.

""We expect 530 bps YoY contraction (up 70 bps QoQ) in gross margin led by raw material inflation, partly offset by about 4-5 percent price increase taken starting May 2021. We expect lower decline (down 414 bps YoY) in EBITDA margin partly aided by operating leverage,"" said Kotak.

Prabhudas Lilladher feels that despite taking a price increase of around 7 percent during the first half of FY22, the gross margin is expected to contract 540 bps to 39 percent due to inflation in key raw material prices. ""We expect an EBITDA margin of 18 percent, down 560 bps YoY"".

Shitij Gandhi, Senior Technical Analyst, SMC Global Securities, has a buy call on the stock, with a target of Rs 3,550 a share.

""At the current juncture, it has given a fresh breakout above the consolidation zone with larger volumes. The price-volume action with breakouts suggests a long build-up in the stock. Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 3,150-3,160,"" he said.

Here is what global brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after Q1 earnings:

Morgan Stanley | Rating: Downgrade to equal-weight from overweight | Target: Rs 3,143

The company's top line was ahead of our estimates and a big beat against the consensus but the margin disappointed. Management remains confident in the growth outlook. The uncertain direction of margin leads us to move to the sidelines. We will wait for a better entry point.

Goldman Sachs | Rating: Sell | Target: Rs 1,679

The company's gross margin contraction raises questions on pricing power. We lower FY22-24 EPS estimates by 2-11 percent. While Q2 is likely to benefit from pent-up demand, we remain cautious on margin.

UBS | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 3,550

The company witnessed a tough quarter and an improved outlook. Management guides for a gradual price increase amid sustained inflation. Q1 domestic decorative volumes grew 106 percent YoY on a low base. It had an encouraging growth in the home-decor business.

Nomura | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 3,300

The company's strong demand continues despite the second Covid wave. Strong demand continues, aided by share gains from unorganised and organised players. Margin will remain compressed in the near term as pricing trails commodity inflation. Medium-term margin will be range-bound, given Grasim’s foray into paints.

Macquarie | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 3,500

Q1 sales performance re-emphasised resilient nature of decorative demand. We are less worried about near-term margin pressure. We cut the FY22 EPS estimate by 8 percent and FY23/24 EPS is raised by 3 percent.

CLSA | Rating: Outperform | Target raised to Rs 3,275

In an inflationary setting, focus on sustaining share gains eroded gross margin. On a low base, margin contraction was limited to 20 bps YoY. The company is optimistic about demand in FY22, with a better monsoon, Diwali and pent-up demand. It looks to maintain the EBIT margin at 19-21 percent.

Asian Paints, one of the largest paint companies in India, is expected to report over a 200 percent year-on-year increase in consolidated profit, with around 100 percent growth in volume in the quarter ended June 2021, largely driven by a low base. The Q1FY21 earnings were hit by nationwide Covid lockdown.

Since the start of financial year FY22, the stock has gained 17.5 percent and rallied 73 percent in the last one year. The revenue growth is likely to be 90 percent higher compared to the year-ago quarter. It was down 43 percent YoY in Q1FY21.

""We expect 100 percent and 96 percent YoY growth in volumes and value in domestic decorative paints notwithstanding lockdown/restrictions pertaining to the second wave of pandemic,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities, which expects a 94 percent YoY growth in consolidated revenue and 228 percent growth in profit for June quarter 2021.

Market share gains from unorganised players, share gains in institutional project sales and strong growth momentum in waterproofing would drive strong performance, it said.

Emkay Research also expects a 233 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated profit and a 93 percent rise in revenue for the quarter. ""Despite lockdowns, a very low base of Q1FY21 (44 percent decline) should lead to volume and value growth of 95 percent and 93 percent in the domestic business,"" said the brokerage.

At the operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) may grow more than 125 percent and the margin could expand 280 bps YoY led by operating leverage but there could be some contraction in gross margin on higher inflation.

""We expect 225 bps YoY (70 bps QoQ) contraction in gross margin led by raw material inflation and partly offset by value engineering and about 2 percent price increase taken starting May 2021,"" said Kotak.

Sharekhan's research report on Asian Paints

Phase-wise unlocking in various states will lead to a gradual recovery in painting activities in the coming months. Home improvement segment to recover from H2FY2022. Price hikes and operating efficiencies would reduce raw material inflation pressure on margins. OPM likely to improve from H2FY2022. Structural growth story of paints industry remains intact with shift from unorganised to organised sector (especially in rural India), shorter repainting cycles, rapid urbanisation and momentum in construction/real estate activity.



Outlook

We maintain a Buy on Asian Paints (APL) with a revised PT of Rs. 3,255. Dominance in the decorative paints industry and focus on becoming a complete home improvement play will keep valuations at premium; currently trading at 63.0x its FY2023E EPS.

Asian Paints share price jumped over 9 percent on May 14 after the company reported an 81.1 percent year-on-year growth in net profit at Rs 870 in March 2021 quarter, driven by strong growth in volume and operating income and a low base in Q4FY20.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after March earnings:

HSBC | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 3,150

The research firm is of the view that Q4 volume and revenue growth of 48 percent and 43 percent were a massive beat aiming to mitigate margin pressure via price hikes and cost-efficiency. The firm believes that the company gave an exceptional performance in FY21 despite disruptions. The company's outlook for FY22 remains strong.

Credit Suisse | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 2,800

Credit Suisse is of the view that Q4 was an exceptionally strong quarter with FY21 volume growth at 13 percent despite COVID. The two-year volume CAGR is also very strong at 22 percent. It expects resilient volume growth from Asian Paints. In the near term, margin pressure is likely to be transient.

Goldman Sachs | Rating: Sell | Target: Rs 1,691

The research firm is of the view that domestic volumes were in line with EBITDA beat on lower costs. Revenue beat was driven by lower-than-expected product mix deterioration. Domestic decorative volume growth of 48 percent was also broadly in line. It translates into a two-year average volume growth of 25 percent against 22 percent in Q3, it said.

ICICI Securities | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 2,970

The brokerage continues to believe in the inherent strength of Asian Paints considering its 80 years old business legacy, strong balance sheet and supply chain. This has not only helped the company to come out strongly from the lockdown disruptions but also register market share gains. The research firm upgraded its recommendation from hold to buy, with a revised target price of Rs 2,970 per share.

""We expect strong 43 percent and 37 percent YoY growth in volumes and value, in domestic decorative paints aided by revival in tier-1/metro markets and continued good demand in tier-3/4 cities,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities.

Market share gains from smaller players and recovery in institutional project sales supported the demand momentum.

KR Choksey expects sales to increase by 43 percent on YoY basis led by pent-up demand noted during the quarter. ""Volume surge attributed to rural economy picking up. International revenues (around 12-13 percent of revenue) will be subdued due to global supply disruption and lesser demand in foreign countries,"" said the brokerage.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Asian Paints

A confluence of positive factors, including (a) a very strong festive season; (b) pent-up demand; (c) recovery in urban, particularly metro demand; (d) recovery in real estate demand, and (e) low material costs for the quarter led to a strong beat on our forecasts. n The company reported its highest ever sales/EBITDA/PAT for any quarter in 3QFY21. While the outlook on demand remains healthy, the extraordinary confluence of positives mentioned above, especially festive season and pent-up demand, may not sustain going forward. n Material cost inflation has also been sharp since December, which means that current all-time high gross and EBITDA margins are unlikely to sustain beyond FY21, especially in a highly competitive industry such as Paints. Valuations are rich at 67.8x FY22E and 58.5x FY23E EPS. Maintain Neutral.

Outlook

APNT has creditably posted much faster recovery than most peers, which is even more impressive considering the highly discretionary nature of the business. This should ensure premium valuations

Asian shares rose on Wednesday as hopes for a successful coronavirus vaccine lifted expectations of a swift reopening of the global economy, which would help the region's heavily trade-dependent markets.

New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose around 0.6% in early trade ahead of the country's central bank meeting.

Japan's Nikkei 225 added 1.1%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index futures rose 0.09%.

""Investors anticipate a lift in economic activity and a swing back to physical businesses, judging by their support for travel, consumer, financial, materials and energy stocks,"" Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist for CMC Markets in Sydney, wrote in a note Wednesday.

The gains in Asia came despite the S&P 500 index slipping slightly and the Nasdaq closing sharply lower on Tuesday as vaccine optimism led investors away from market leaders and toward cyclical stocks associated with economic recovery.

At the same time, there were mixed signals from U.S. government leaders about near-term policies.

President Donald Trump and other top Republican lawmakers continued their refusal to concede the election to President-elect Joe Biden, delaying the transition of power and related policy shifts.

U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers also said on Tuesday that a surge in coronavirus cases threatens to slow economic growth once more and that more targeted government aid was needed.

That shouldn't stop government stimulus efforts, according to ANZ Research strategists Liz Kendall and David Croy.

""Policy makers remain vigilant and monetary policy will err towards being very accommodative until a vaccine can be comprehensively rolled out,"" they wrote on Wednesday.

E-mini futures for the S&P 500 were flat.

European shares held near eight-month highs on Tuesday, riding a wave of optimism about a COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough, although concerns about the pandemic's economic damage capped gains.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints (APNT) witnessed consistent MoM demand improvement in 2QFY21. This augurs well for growth in 2HFY21 unless a second wave of COVID plays spoilsport. With stable material cost as well as currency, elevated margins also appear likely to sustain over the next few quarters. However, valuations of 58.4x FY22E EPS appear to be fully capturing the growth revival. This is despite assuming 20% PBT growth and 21.5% PAT growth in FY22E, nearly 3x the PBT CAGR over FY16-FY21E. Maintain Neutral.

Outlook

Valuing the company at 50x Sep’22E EPS, we get a TP of INR1,980, 6% downside to CMP. Maintain Neutral.

ICICI Direct's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints reported stellar numbers with one of the best quarterly EBITDA margins in Q2FY21. The EBITDA margin at 23.6%, up ~470 bps YoY led by benign raw material prices and saving in other expenditure in Q2FY21. On the revenue front, sales growth at ~6% YoY was led by double digit (I-direct estimate: ~10%) volume growth in Q2FY21. Despite being a lean season on account of monsoons, the strong decorative volume growth is attributable to significant pent up demand in rural and semi urban regions led by repainting/maintenance activities. Gradual opening up of metro regions along with inventory build-up in the wake of festive seasons at dealer would have also help drive the volume growth in Q2FY21. We believe normalisation in metro regions, revival in the real estate industry and intact repainting demand from semi-urban, rural India would drive paint demand, going forward. Besides, we believe favourable raw material prices are likely to keep gross margins elevated in the coming quarters even with a change in product mix. This, coupled with rationalisation of other costs would help drive EBITDA margin, going forward. We revise our revenue, earnings estimates upside by 6% and 33%, respectively, for FY21E factoring in the current quarter performance. We introduce FY23 estimates with revenue, earning CAGR of 12%, 15% respectively in FY20-23E.

Outlook

We introduce FY23E estimates and model revenue, earning CAGR of 12%, 13% in FY20-23E supported by strong volume growth and elevated margin profile. We roll over our valuation on FY23E and upgrade our recommendation from HOLD to BUY with a revised target price of Rs 2440.

HDFC Securities' research report on Asian Paints

Delivering growth along with improving profitability and untouched free cash generation during a pandemic, especially when top cities are yet to fire (70-80% of base quarter sales) is a testimony to APNT’s distribution and product portfolio heft. That said, the recovery is more than priced in at 54x Sept-22 P/E.

Outlook

We revise our FY22/23 EPS estimates marginally (2/4% resp) and, consequently, our DCF-based TP to Rs. 1,850/sh (earlier TP: Rs. 1,800/sh) implying 50x Sep-22 P/E.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian Paints

We are cutting FY22 and F23 EPS 6.6% and 5% and rating to Hold despite stellar performance in 2Q mainly due to 1) standalone Gross margins at 45.4% are down 90bps QoQ and have peaked out 2) Strong volume recovery post 1QFY21 means that the base for FY22 and FY23 will be higher than was earlier anticipated 3) while current margin expansion is 470bps, it has come over a low base (18.9%) and leaves limited room for expansion in FY22 and FY23. Foray into lighting, furnishings and furniture is expected to provide scale to home improvement business, although it will drag margins in near term. While we remain constructive about the structural growth opportunity in decorative paints and huge advantage APNT has got in distribution, brand and systems, the PAT growth in FY22 and FY23 is likely to be lower than earlier expectations. We estimate a CAGR of 15.9% sales, 16.7% EBIDTA and 22% in PAT over FY21-23, which factors in most positives.

Outlook

We assign Hold rating with a target price of Rs2000 @46.5xFY23 EPS (Rs2032 earlier@45xFY23 EPS). We believe returns will be back ended given ~25% rally in stock price in last 3 months.

Asian Paints has reported better performance than expected in the quarter ended September 2020, with double-digit volume growth in decorative business against 7-8 percent growth expectations by the CNBC-TV18 poll estimates.

Consolidated net profit grew by 1.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 851.9 crore, hit by higher tax cost, and revenue increased 5.9 percent YoY to Rs 5,350.2 crore in July-September period 2020.

""Profitability across businesses was well supported by a better product mix, the stable raw material prices, favourable foreign exchange rate and the large number of cost optimisation measures put in place by the Management,"" Amit Syngle, Managing Director and CEO, said.

He further said all the business segments continued to witness improving demand conditions on a progressive basis during the second quarter of this financial year.

""The decorative business segment registered good volume growths for each of the months and therefore a healthy double-digit volume growth for the quarter with demand picking up across regions. The other business segments in India including the two industrial coatings business and both the segments in the Home Improvement category also experienced improving trends in line with the phased-out re-opening of the economy,"" he detailed.

Syngle said the international business portfolio did well, supported by favourable market conditions in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, with the exception of Nepal, which continued to witness challenging business conditions due to the pandemic.

Consolidated profit was estimated at Rs 700 crore on a revenue of Rs 5,200 crore for the quarter, according to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Tax expenses for the quarter stood at Rs 293.6 crore, against Rs 7.2 crore in the year-ago period, the company said in its BSE filing.

At the operating level, consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) jumped 32.5 percent to Rs 1,265 crore and margin climbed 470 bps to 23.6 percent compared to the corresponding period last fiscal, which were higher than the CNBC-TV18 poll estimates of Rs 1,100 crore and 21.2 percent respectively.

""The company reported strong numbers in times of COVID by beating street expectation in all counts. We are bullish on Asian Paints on the back of improving demand scenario and given its strong distribution and supply chain,"" Keshav Lahoti, Associate Equity Analyst at Angel Broking said.

Paints segment registered a 6.2 percent YoY growth in Q2FY21 revenue at Rs 5,233 crore with its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rising 29 percent and margin expansion of 400 bps YoY.

Asian Paints will report its September quarter results on October 22. The company could see a decline in profitability but operating earnings may remain strong on a year-on-year basis due to cost measures, with revenue growth at 2-3 percent.

On the sequential basis (i.e. compared to June quarter 2020), earnings may see a substantial increase due to low base in Q1 FY21 that affected by lockdown.

""We expect a recovery in decorative paints volumes in September 2020 quarter (down 35-45 percent YoY in June 2020) and following trends: (1) growth driven by North and East followed by South; West would be a bit soft, dragged down by Maharashtra, (2) tier-2 and tier-3 towns would continue to drive growth, (3) volume growth would continue to be 500-600 bps higher than value growth on account of higher sales of economy products and putty,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees 3 percent fall in profit but 2 percent increase in revenue and 17 percent rise in EBITDA in Q2FY21 YoY.

For Asian Paints, the brokerage estimates 2.7 percent YoY growth in domestic decorative sales (standalone) led by about 8 percent volume growth, and expect flat sales in overseas business (subsidiaries) led by a recovery in Indonesia and MENA regions.

Gross margin expansion could be 230 bps YoY and 80 bps sequentially due to a fall in crude oil prices, said Motilal Oswal which sees 3 percent revenue growth YoY and 17.5 percent growth in EBITDA. Sharekhan too sees 3 percent growth in Q2 revenue YoY.

The price of titanium dioxide (TiO2), a crude-linked raw material, was down 4.2 percent in Q2FY21 YoY.

""Continued cost-saving initiatives and slightly lower media intensity would translate into robust EBITDA margin expansion,"" Kotak said.

According to the brokerage house, the sequential increase in profit could be 220 percent, revenue 76 percent and EBITDA 131 percent with 520 bps margin expansion in September quarter 2020.

For instance, the paint industry is expected to shrink in FY21 due to operational challenges under COVID-19 safety protocols.

As per a report by brokerage firm Elara Capital, the paints industry (with market size of Rs 50,000 crore as on FY20, including the unorganized market) may shrink in FY21, as smaller companies will find it difficult to operate and sell under COVID-19 safety protocols.

Elara pointed out that the concerns over hiring painters and contractors for homes have reduced due to “safe painting” practices, followed by paint companies selling PPE kits, sanitizers, and gloves to painters and dealers (for sanitizing shops).

""Customers are being educated regarding these services, which has reduced the fear factor in these COVID-19 times,"" Elara said.

Elara's survey in August showed while luxury emulsion (Rs 400/ltr and above) to improve indoor air quality (anti-pollution, anti-bacteria and environment friendly) and reduce the incidence of infection-causing bacteria and material-destroying fungi that contaminate surfaces every day were present in the market as well, they have gained higher adoption rates post the pandemic as consumers are looking for not only functionality and durability from decorative paints but also hygiene.

Sanitization services provided by paint firms are a huge business opportunity for markets, which have big housing societies, as they have a common fund for society’s maintenance purposes, Elara pointed out.

For these services, as per the brokerage, companies charge about Rs 1-2/sqft. Paint companies are providing these add-on services regardless of any painting work done.

The smaller players of the sector may find it difficult to match the scale of larger firms as they have a wider reach and robust supply chains.

""Larger firms with almost seamless supply chains, higher budget for dealers, a knack for expanding network due to brand value and consistent availability of products are gaining share within multi-brand outlets,"" Elara said.

""The top 4 firms are pushing 'value for money' (20-30 percent lower than the luxury variants) and mid-segment variants aggressively through volume schemes to upgrade the market from the economy segment, thereby making it even tougher for smaller brands,"" Elara said.

Consumer preferences in India are inclined toward premium emulsion due to higher expectations of better finish and durability from branded expensive paints.

Elara expects decorative paints to clock in 8 percent year-on-year (YoY) value growth from Q2 against 5 percent in FY20, higher than pre-COVID levels, with strong offtake for premium and “value for money” variants from July from Tier II, III & IV cities and continuing until August, and with the outlook for large metros also improving sequentially until December.

""We expect this to sustain, given the consumer base is just a handful of households in India, and with safe painting and sanitization services in place, it has long-term potential (8-10 percent CAGR) to clock GDP+ growth rate,"" Elara said.

Elara has upgraded decorative sales estimates for Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Kansai Nerolac from Q2 from 5 percent to 8 percent as a result of accruing consolidation benefits.

The auto industry, which is a major consumer of the paints sector is expecting a rise in volume, which will benefit the paint sector.

Elara Capital believes auto volume will post 5-10 percent YoY volume growth from August, led by demand in two-wheelers and passenger vehicles from upcountry markets in bikes and hatchbacks while the UV segment is on the rise in the urban markets, as brand features-pricing combination at Rs 7-12 lakh has hit a sweet spot to upgrade a large and young consumer base from Rs 6-9 lakh segment.

""We revise FY22 estimates by 7.8 percent for Kansai Nerolac, 1.1 percent for Asian Paints and 0.2 percent for Berger Paints,"" Elara Capital said.

Elara has assigned a higher P/E of 50 times (pre-COVID 2-year forward multiple) for Asian Paints (earlier: 45.7 times) to arrive at a higher target price of Rs 2,053 from Rs 1,768 with an 'accumulate' rating.

For Berger Paints, Elara has a sell call with a target price of Rs 527.

Elara has an 'accumulate' call with a raised the target price to Rs 565 from Rs 537 for Kansai Nerolac, based on 40 times (unchanged) on September 2022E earnings.

Sharekhan's research repor on Asian Paints

Construction and painting activities have re-gained momentum especially in the tier III/IV towns. Further there is an emerging trend of consumer shifting to better quality paints (including puttys, distempers and emulsions) in the rural market. Asian Paints (APL), a leading player in the decorative paints segment, will benefit from the rural recovery and its volumes are likely to grow in double digits in the near term. In metros, a gradual recovery is likely from Q3FY2021. Benign input prices would continue to support margins; cost savings would help OPM improve q-o-q and stabilise in Q3FY2021.



Outlook

A sturdy balance sheet, consistent dividend payouts and focus on becoming a complete home improvement player makes APL a better pick in consumer goods space. We maintain Buy with revised PT of Rs. 2,275.

Asian Paints on Tuesday said its manufacturing facilities are working at up to 70 percent capacities due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and resultant lockdowns.

The company said its business has picked up progressively in tier 2, 3, 4 cities where the demand conditions were better, while in metros and some tier 1 cities, the pace of recovery is slow.

""All the operations which were disrupted since early March 2020 have seen resumption since early May, 2020. The company has been able to open all manufacturing plants after taking requisite Government permissions,” Asian Paints said in a regulatory filing.

The permissions are for running the plants across all the businesses to a limited capacity or even to a full capacity in some geographies, it said, pointing out that manufacturing facilities of the company are working at approximately 60-70 percent levels.

Asian Paints business divisions include decorative, home improvement and industrial operations.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Asian Paints

While Asian Paints (APNT) reported sharp YoY declines of 42.7%, 58.2%, and 67.4% in sales, EBITDA, and PAT, respectively, the numbers were still better than expected given the double-digit volume growth witnessed in Jun’20. Importantly, commentary on recovery sustaining is also reasonably strong. -Despite healthy volume growth, earnings growth has been weak for several years now, which is likely to continue going ahead. Nevertheless, the likelihood of sharp earnings decline, as feared earlier, may not materialize. Therefore, it is possible that APNT, unlike other discretionary peers, would emerge relatively unscathed from the COVID-19 crisis. With better than expected recovery, APNT continues to remain market leader in a category with attractive long term potential. Hence, we upgrade our rating from Sell to Neutral.

Outlook

Rich valuations of 55x FY22 EPS for a business with uncertain earnings growth and weaker ROCE v/s peers prevent us from turning more constructive. Rich valuations of 55x FY22 EPS for a business with uncertain earnings growth and weaker ROCE v/s peers prevent us from turning more constructive. We value APNT at 50x Jun’22 EPS, leading to TP of INR1,605, with 6% downside over CMP.

Dolat Capital's research report on Asian Paints

APL’s Q1FY21 revenues, EBITDA and APAT came below our estimate due to delayed pick-up in demand compared to our expectation. Nevertheless, double digit volume growth (+14%) in June’20, was a key positive. We believe overall volume de-growth in Domestic Decorative business was 38% in Q1FY21. IB posted mixed results as better performance in Africa and ME was offset by Covid led slowdown in Nepal and Bangladesh. Considering mixed impact of double digit exit rate for the quarter and lockdowns in few states in July, we believe that growth would normalize in H2FY21E. Consequently, we have maintained our EPS estimates for FY21E and FY22E at Rs 26.4 and Rs 33.5 respectively. We arrive at a TP of Rs 1,840 (55x FY22E EPS). Given rich valuations, we maintain our Reduce rating. Buy on dips. We believe that the volume growth in the decorative segment should remain high, especially in rural areas, given better crop production this season. Further, ongoing government investments in rural infrastructure, and house construction in rural areas should partially mitigate overall slowdown.

Outlook

In the long term, we remain optimistic about the paint industry, considering an expected shift from the unorganised to organised sector. APL, being a leader in the category, is likely to benefit the most from the shift.

ICICI Direct's research report on Asian Paints

As expected, Asian Paint’s Q1FY21 revenue, earnings declined due to washout of sales in April 2020 but ~14% YoY decorative volume growth in June 2020 was encouraging. Demand was largely supported by a pick-up in repainting/maintenance activities in suburban and rural India, post relaxation from lockdown. According to the management while tier II, tier III cities saw a strong demand recovery in Q1FY21, demand recovery in metros, tier 1 cities (contribute ~40-50% in sales) was slower due to intermediary lockdowns especially in western regions. On the raw material fronts, gross margins expanded ~110 bps YoY but were down QoQ in similar lines mainly due to change in product mix. The favourable raw material prices movement on a month on month basis is likely to keep gross margins elevated for the coming quarter as well. This, coupled with rationalisation of other costs (like rents, advertisement & distribution expenses) would lead to a recovery in EBITDA margin (16.6% in Q1FY21), going forward. We revise our revenue, earnings estimates upside by 10% and 7%, respectively, for FY21E factoring in the current quarter performance. We maintain our positive stance on the stock given its strong balance sheet and robust dealer network.

Outlook

Asian Paints with its prudent balance sheet management with stringent control on working capital cycle should easily navigate through this challenging demand condition. However, we believe most positives are priced in the stock. Hence, we maintain our target price and HOLD rating on the stock.

APNT remains optimistic of sustaining June sales trend (14% volume growth) amidst strong demand from Tier2/4 cities (less Covid 19 Impact) and repainting (more time spent at home) even as poor demand from real estate and downtrading remains a near term challenge. Easing of lockdown norms and safe painting campaign has boded well for the company, although Near term pressures in Metros and Tier1 cities, rising spread of Covid19 in smaller cities and sporadic lockdowns remain a key risk.

Management Participants: Amit Syngle- MD and CEO

The decorative business in India saw improvement in demand in May and June after complete washout in April. The Business picked up led by better demand conditions in Tier ll, Tier lll and Tier lV cities while urban and metros remained slow due to the higher impact of the pandemic. The company’s business achieved 80 percent of the base volumes in May and managed to grow by more than 14 percent in June, the management said.

At an overall level for the first quarter, the business was able to achieve 62 percent of the base of PY in volumes and 56 percent in value terms led by premium products and upgradations across markets and categories. The company’s foray into health & health and hygiene segment with Viroprotekt has helped to push Royal health shield (new variant which offers all surface anti-bacterial protection). Introduction of new sanitizing service has added to the company’s service brand, it said.

The company’s international business posted double-digit volume growth in June after negative growth in April and May. The company’s units in UAE and Africa posted good traction as the lockdown in these countries were lifted in April while Asia remained the most affected with Nepal being severely impacted due to lockdown in April and May and Ethiopia posting a low single-digit growth. The automotive coating JV (PPG-AP) continues to be remain affected due to COVID-19 coupled with a slowdown in the domestic automotive industry while the industrial coatings JV (AP-PPG) also remained impacted due to COVID-19 but are witnessing improving trends in June in both protective coatings and powder coating segments, the management added.

According to Asian Paints' management, both the segments in the Home Improvement category viz. the Kitchen (Sleek) and Bath business WAS impacted due to COVID-19 to the extent of 50 percent in terms of top-line versus previous corresponding quarter. Progress has been slower in this category. The softer material prices coupled with management's focus on cost-saving measures resulted in gross margin expansion for coating business in India as well in international markets.

Employee cost increased on account of increase in retirement liabilities during the quarter which is one time. Dealer expansion happened in the month of May and June. As per management, the customers are moving towards premium and value for money in the interiors segment than the luxurious segment in exteriors. The management expects growth trajectory in waterproofing will be better than painting in coming times.

The management does not expect much volatility in material prices in the next quarter. The company will focus on core strengths, cost rationalisation and cash conservation.

Dolat Capital's research report on Asian Paints

Over the years, Asian Paints (APL) has transformed from being a product-centric to a consumer and service-oriented brand. With unparalleled dealer network of 70K+, the company has been gaining market share in the domestic paint market as a leader, with product innovation being the hallmark of its strategy. During FY15-20, the company exhibited a strong 8%/14% growth in revenue and net profit respectively. Given the volatile Covid-19 situation, we expect painting demand to remain muted in the short term.



Outlook

However, with >40% share in decorative paint business, diversification into waterproofing and home improvement, and healthy financials; APL would continue to command premium valuations.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints’ Q4 performance was below expectations. Weak mix and the extended lockdown from mid-March resulted in a 7% decline in sales and 3% fall in EBITDA, both below our expectations by 4% and 7%, respectively. Lower input prices aided gross margin expansion (280bps QoQ), which should continue as input prices remain soft. However, margin gains may reduce on rising crude prices, weak mix and likely price cuts. Lower sales and additional spends on safety, sanitization and trade incentives may also restrict the operating margins gains. Management indicated a stronger recovery in smaller towns, with metros and tier 1 (40 50% of sales) seeing slower recovery. Growth for VFM products is likely to remain strong and it will continue to drive higher growth in the low-end segment.



Outlook

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian Paints

APNT reported low single digit volume growth as lockdown impacted performance in 4Q. Near term volume pressures are likely to sustain as Metros and Tier1 cities (40-50% of volumes) remain under severe pressure due to Covid 19 impact. APNT has started safe painting campaign and expects labor to return once normalcy is restored. However, slowdown in real estate and guidelines on construction activity will impact sales in near term. Despite near term challenges, we remain positive in the structural growth story due to 1) product portfolio straddling across price points 2) huge scope in entry level paints given deep distribution (2x nearest competitor) and 3) success of new products at 15-20% lower prices.



Outlook

We marginally tweak our estimates given low input costs and lower dividend and capex and estimate 16.5% PAT CAGR over FY20-22. We value the stock at 45xFY22 EPS of 38.7 and arrive at a target price of 1722 (Earlier Rs1687). Retain Accumulate.

Asian Paints, one of the largest paint manufacturers, is expected to report double-digit growth in bottomline for the quarter ended March 2020, but revenue growth could be flat to negative on account of already slowed down environment in industrial/auto segments and COVID-19-led lockdown. Quarterly earnings will be announced on June 23.

Brokerages expect the company's profit to grow in the range of 12-15 percent compared to year-ago period, driven by operating income and lower tax cost.

The COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown impacted sales in the last 10 days of the quarter. ""We model a 4.5 percent YoY decline in domestic sales (standalone) led by 1 percent volume growth and negative 5.5 percent price/mix. Continued higher sales of economy products would impact product mix on YoY basis, though we expect some improvement in product mix on sequential basis and hence narrowing of gap between volume growth and revenue growth. We expect international business revenues to decline by 5 percent YoY,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees 15 percent YoY rise in profit in Q4.

According to Narnolia, Asian Paints' revenue is expected to remain flat on account of turbulence caused by COVID-19 in Q4FY20.

""The revenues from automotive coating JV (PPG-AP) is expected to remain impacted on account of domestic automotive industry slowdown while industrial coatings JV (AP-PPG) is expected to improve led by slight increase in demand from protective coatings segment. However, lower material prices are expected to favour profitability of both these JVs,"" the brokerage said.

The operating performance during the quarter is expected to be supported by decline in crude oil prices. Oil derivatives are the raw materials of paint companies.

""Gross margin expansion was on account of sharp decline in crude price. Tio2 prices were down 9.5 percent YoY in Q4FY20,"" said Motilal Oswal which sees 20 percent YoY increase in EBITDA, 180 basis points expansion in gross margin and 260 bps rise in EBITDA margin for the quarter.

Markets regulator Sebi on Monday penalised an individual after finding him guilty of releasing unpublished price sensitive information related to financial results of Asian Paints through WhatsApp messages prior to the official announcement by the company. The watchdog has imposed a penalty of Rs 15 lakh on Neeraj Kumar Agarwal.

Earlier, Sebi had penalised Shruti Vora, who has been working in the institutional team at Antique Stock Broking Ltd from September 2008, for releasing Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI) related to financial results of Asian Paints through WhatsApp messages.

Some news reports had referred to the circulation of UPSI in various private WhatsApp groups about certain companies ahead of their official announcements to the respective stock exchanges.

Against this backdrop, Sebi initiated a preliminary examination in the matter during which search and seizure operation against 26 entities of a WhatsApp group were conducted, and about 190 devices and records, among others, were seized.

WhatsApp chats extracted from the seized devices were examined further and it was found that earnings data and other financial information of around 12 companies were leaked through WhatsApp messages.

Asian Paints was among the firms whose quarterly financial results closely matched with the messages that were circulated in WhatsApp chats.

The regulator carried out an investigation in the matter of circulation of UPSI through WhatsApp messages with respect to Asian Paints to ascertain any possible violation of the PIT (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations during March-May 2017 period.

Sebi probe found that Agarwal communicated the UPSI related to total income, EBITDA and profit after tax of Asian Paints for quarter ending March 2017 through WhatsApp messages.

It was observed that the financial figures of Asian Paints circulated through WhatsApp closely matched with those disclosed subsequently by the company to the exchanges.

""The noticee (Agarwal), being an insider, had communicated the UPSI relating to Asian Paints Ltd, to other person through WhatsApp messages, which is in violation of the provisions... of Sebi (PIT) Regulations, 2015, for which the noticee is liable for monetary penalty,"" Sebi said in its 36-page order.

As per the PIT norms, any person who is in possession of UPSI is regarded as an insider.

Earlier, the regulator had fined persons involved in communicating financial results of Bajaj Auto, Ambuja Cement, Wipro and Mindtree through WhatsApp messages before their official announcements.",397,-0.9085758924484253

At a time when companies are looking to cut salaries, Asian Paints has said it will go ahead with its annual salary increments.

A company official confirmed the development to CNBC-TV18.

""We will go ahead with the increments for this year across the board to boost employee morale during these times,"" the official said.

""Despite the challenging environment due to COVID-19, we haven't laid off people. Firing people is not the Asian Paints culture,"" the official said.

The company has chosen to go ahead with salary hikes, fully aware that revenues for the current quarter will be quite weak.

""We're watching and devising scenarios as to what can happen in these exceptional circumstances,"" the company's Managing Director Amit Syngle had said in an interview with CNBC-TV18 call last week.

""We don't see any action happening in the first quarter. Q1 is really wiped off in terms of all the indications that are coming in,” he said.

The company has asked for extended payment terms from its vendors to manage its working capital cycle, but has extended the concessions to dealers. In a letter to dealers last week, Asian Paints offered free sanitization of paint shops, free medical insurance of shop attendants and painters, a 45- day extension on payments due to the company and a 2 percent discount if payment made within 45 Days.

While these steps may not result in immediate financial benefits for the company, they will definitely go a long way in cementing relations with key stakeholders like employees and partners.

Asian Paints share price was down almost 3 percent intraday on May 12, hitting a 7-week low. Global research firm Goldman Sachs also downgraded the stock to sell with a target at Rs 1,111 per share.

The stock has fallen over 17 percent in the last 15 days and was quoting at Rs 1,536.50, down Rs 32.75, or 2.09 percent, at 11:00 hours on May 12.

According to the research firm, there are significant risks to sales growth as it expects consumers to down trade and extend the re-painting cycle given the macroeconomic slowdown.

Goldman Sachs forecasts FY22E and FY23 volume growth to be 1.5x real GDP growth (lower than the long-term average of 1.7x). It expects volume growth to slow to an average of 6 percent over the next three years.

Asian Paints sales CAGR of 3 percent (FY19-22E) is among the lowest in its coverage, it added.

According to Glodman Sachs, the stock is pricing in 23 percent average volume growth (3.3x of real GDP) in FY22-24E, leaving limited upside from current levels.

While Asian Paints will benefit from the pullback in input costs and can re-invest the same to drive volume growth, it assumes 7 percent average higher volume growth in FY22/23E (at 2.3-2.5x real GDP growth), equates to an implied valuation suggesting 32 percent downside, the research firm said.

According to Moneycontrol SWOT Analysis powered by Trendlyne, MFs have decreased their shareholding last quarter. The momentum is weak with price below short, medium and long term averages.

The year 2019 ended on a pretty strong wicket for equity markets around the world. Most major indices were up 10-25% during the year. The Dow Jones increased investors’ wealth by ~22%, the FTSE, Hang Seng, and India’s Nifty by ~12% and the Nikkei by 18%.

However, 2020 brought with it the rumblings of what eventually became a global pandemic, bringing some of the largest economies of the world to a standstill. As Covid19 spread worldwide, stock markets crashed globally, with many indices recording their worst-ever quarter performance and many others seeing the fastest-ever correction in recent history.

In India, the broader markets were anyway appearing shaky due to the weak growth in corporate profits for the past 6-7 years. Then came Covid-19 to add to investors’ troubles. And in the middle of all this came the collapse of Yes Bank. In a matter of weeks, the stock markets and the larger economy were dealing with a full-fledged crisis.

In five parts, Saurabh Mukherjea, founder of Marcellus Investment Managers, and his team elaborate on their investment process and emphasise on the techniques that have helped their fund navigate through tough markets and a crisis.

Read part 2 of the series here.

Part 1

India is blessed with several companies that have the unique combination of market dominance and return ratios far in excess of the cost of capital. The resulting free cash generation enables these companies to reinvest back into their businesses to keep strengthening their dominance and return ratios. This cycle gives an opportunity to invest in these businesses and see your money compound at a steady rate over long periods of time.

Economic theory dictates that in a competitive market, no firm can consistently earn a return much higher than its cost of capital. This is because the excess returns will attract more competition, which will, in turn, reduce the profitability of all players operating in that market.

By extension, this means that in a competitive market, even a business that has a large or dominant market share in its industry will earn returns on capital employed (ROCE – earnings generated on each unit of capital employed on the balance sheet) or Returns on Equity ( RoE – returns on each unit of equity invested in the business) close to its Cost of Equity or Cost of Capital.

It is not hard to find global players who dominate their industries – Walmart dominates US grocery retailing, Carrefour dominates French grocery retailing, Toyota dominates the mid-segment car market in Japan, Hanes dominates Europe’s innerwear market. However, none of these companies make ROEs substantially higher than their cost of equity (see table below).

In India, on the other hand, there are several industries where one or two companies not only have a dominant market share, but their RoEs have also remained substantially above the cost of capital (CoC) for several decades in a row (see Exhibit 2).

The strong pricing power and competitive advantage of these Indian firms is what sets them apart from their global counterparts.

The gap between RoCE and CoC is the free cash flow that a firm generates for its shareholders. Provided these firms sustain this wide gap whilst also growing their capital employed, they will generate healthy earnings growth consistently over long periods of time, regardless of changes in the internal or external operating environment of these companies. We call these firms ‘Consistent Compounders’.

Once an investor builds a portfolio of such firms, all that she should do is hold them for long periods of time and benefit from the power of compounding of healthy returns, with the volatility in these returns being similar to that of a government bond!

This sounds very simple, but simple is not always easy! You need to first figure out what exactly is a company’s competitive advantage that helps it dominate its industry and generate returns much higher than its cost of capital.

Second you need to assess the sustainability of the competitive advantage, which will enable the company to maintain its dominance and free cash generation ability for long periods of time – keeping in motion a cycle of earning returns much above the cost of capital, deploying the resulting large free cash flow to grow its business, profits and market dominance, in turn further strengthening its competitive advantages leading to higher free cash flow.

For example, it is easy to find firms like Maruti Suzuki, which has maintained its industry dominance (>50% market share of cars in India), but its average 10-year ROCE is just 17% – like that of Toyota and Hanes highlighted above. Or take the example of Hindustan Unilever (HUL), which sustains a wide gap between RCE and CoC, but does not find avenues to grow its capital employed and hence, despite maintaining >80% ROCE over the past 10-15 years, has generated an annualised earnings growth of only 8% (CAGR) over this period.

Without a thorough understanding of a company’s core fundamental strengths, one may make an initial investment in a portfolio of Consistent Compounders, but may have a less than ideal percentage allocation in the portfolio and/or a shorter than ideal holding period of such stocks in the portfolio. So let’s use a case study to understand how a company builds sustainable competitive advantages and becomes a Consistent Compounder.

Case Study of a Consistent Compounder: Asian Paints

One of the biggest challenges in running a decorative paints business in India is that being a chemical, paints are highly voluminous products. The average realisation of a decorative paint in India is around Rs 100 per litre – 10-times more voluminous than say FMCG where the average realisation is around Rs 1000 per litre.

This characteristic makes it challenging to store and transport 4000+ SKUs of decorative paints to 70,000+ dealers across the country. The easiest way to overcome this challenge is to appoint various layer in the distribution channel – third-party C&F Agents, stockists, wholesalers, distributors etc – and let the voluminous product be on the balance sheets of these channel partners while the supply chain through these distribution layers. This is exactly how paints used to be distributed before the 1960s.

However, as Asian Paints became the market leader, they ended up redefining the supply chain dynamics of the decorative paints industry in two ways.

Firstly, Asian Paints reached out directly to the paint dealers on the high-street, without any involvement of a distributor / wholesaler / stockist etc. This has meant that decorative paints is perhaps the only mass-market product sold in India directly to 70,000+ dealers on the high-street by the manufacturer.

Secondly, although MRP printed on a box of decorative paint gives a healthy margin to the dealer, the price at which these products get sold to customers leaves on average only ~3% margin for the dealer – one of the thinnest margins available to the last-mile distribution layer across all B2C categories.

These two changes (direct supply to paint dealers, and only about 3% average margin of the paint dealers) has totally changed the competitive advantage framework for this industry. Let’s delve into this further.

The choice of product manufacturer (and hence the driver of market shares) in a paint project is not really done by the homeowner because he chooses products of the company whose shade-card is brought to him by his trusted contractor / painter (i.e. the influencer).

The painter, in turn, chooses the shade card based on ready availability of all SKUs on the shade card at all points of time with the nearest dealer – this is because paint inventory has to be replenished few times during a paint project and the painter’s team of daily wage workers cannot afford to sit idle due to stock-outs of one of the 4000+ SKUs at the nearest dealer’s shop. Hence market shares in the industry are defined by what the paint dealer decides to stock most readily in his shop. Let us now focus on what drives decision-making of the paint dealer.

The largest element of capital employed for a paint dealer in India is real estate. On this real estate, the store economics for the ROCE of a kirana (convenience store) are totally different from that of a paint dealer.

Firstly, on the same shelf space, a kirana can stock 10x more value of FMCG products compared to the value of decorative paint products, given the voluminous nature of paints (as quantified previously). Secondly, the margin available on each Rupee of sale for a Kirana is 4x higher than that of a paint dealer (12% for a kirana store vs 3% for a paint dealer).

Hence, the only way for a paint dealer to generate ROCE similar to that of a kirana, can be by offsetting the 40x differential (10x multiplied by 4x) through inventory turns which are 40x faster for a paint dealer vs inventory turns of a kirana store.

If Britannia and Hindustan Unilever deliver once in 10 days to a kirana in a city, then the paint dealer next-door requires delivery of paint products with a frequency of 40 times in 10 days i.e. 4 times in a single day. This is exactly the solution which Asian Paints provides to paint dealers, unmatched by most other decorative paint companies in the industry. Why?

Asian Paints has perhaps been the most pro-active corporate investor in technology across the country over the past 60 years. One of the many benefits of tech investments has been the ability of Asian Paints to forecast demand with a high level of accuracy, for each SKU, each location and for every week of the year.

This ensures that without waiting for demand from a paint dealer, the firm optimises the type and quantity of raw material procurement, manufactured products and inventories for each of its depots and delivery trucks. Asian Paints’ competitors are not capable of this sort of precise demand forecasting. Furthermore, the firm continues to deepen this capability over time, since its enormous market share brings to it more data on current demand from every location, than what is received by its competitors.

The importance of supply chain efficiency in helping define winners in the decorative paints industry is so high that over the past 3 decades several competitors have failed to gain any market share by offering: a) superior quality of products (e.g. Dulux Velvet Touch); and b) greater channel margins to paint dealers (e.g. Jotun and Sherwin Williams – before the latter sold their Indian business to Berger).

Finally, Asian Paints keeps investing in ways to disrupt the industry rather than waiting for a competitor to disrupt it. For example, Asian Paints has spent more than a decade in establishing value-added labour-oriented offerings like Asian Paints Home solutions, Water Proofing solutions, Color consultancies, etc. These services benefit from a transition that the sector has undergone over the past few decades.

Asian Paints has limited product price hikes to less than 3.0% CAGR because of incremental operating efficiencies being derived by the firm consistently. This, in turn, has meant that on average, 65% of the cost of a paint project in India is labour (up from 20-30% two decades ago).

This transition calls for a possibility to drive market share in the industry by offering a value-added labour experience to a household in exchange for a labour-intensive composition of the project cost. Such initiatives increase the longevity of Asian Paints’ powerful franchise.

Asian Paints on Friday made its foray into the hand and surface sanitizer segment by launching Viroprotek range of products. The entry into the segment is aimed at supporting the government in its various measures towards COVID-19 relief and address the huge need of hand and surface sanitization in these testing times, Asian Paints said in a statement.

""The product is being manufactured at company's existing plant at Ankleshwar, Gujarat, after obtaining all the necessary statutory approvals and permissions,"" it added.

Commenting on the launch, Asian Paints Managing Director and CEO Amit Syngle said the company has been working in the health and hygiene space for some time and had introduced earlier Royale Health Shield, a product which provides bacterial protection for homes.

""We felt it apt to consolidate our portfolio in the hygiene space and address the growing requirement of hand and surface sanitizers for increased protection and assist the government in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic,” he added.

Asian Paints has already committed Rs 35 crore towards central as well as other state emergency relief funds to combat COVID-19. It is also working with several NGOs for providing food, masks and sanitizers.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Oil prices have been hit hard due to low demand after novel coronavirus or COVID-19 forced the world to either go on lockdown or partial shutdown. Oil prices are at their lowest level since 2003.

The price war raised by Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, after OPEC and its allies failed to agree on production cuts last month also put a lot of pressure.

International benchmark Brent crude futures dropped to $24.68 a barrel intraday on March 23, the lowest since April 2003, down 65 percent from its 2020 peak seen in January. Today at the time of writing this copy, oil price gained 3.44 percent to trade at $27.96 a barrel amid hopes that the United States will sign a $2 trillion stimulus deal to support the economy from COVID-19.

The steep fall in oil price is definitely positive not only for India, which imports around 85 percent of the requirement but also for companies which use as their raw material in any form.

We spoke to analysts to find out what are those sectors or stocks to get benefitted from falling oil price.

Most analysts feel oil marketing, paint and tyre companies gained the most as crude oil is their direct raw material for their products.

""Amid volatile crude prices, oil marketing companies (OMC), paints and tyre sector will be benefited most. We would recommend buying paint

and selective tyre companies in this turmoil. We would recommend investors to refrain buying OMCs from current levels as demand may decline due to coronavirus outbreak globally,"" Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor told Moneycontrol.

AK Prabhakar of IDBI Capital also said normally oil marketing companies were going to benefit, while paint and tyre sectors will also be benefited as crude is the raw material for them.

It will also benefit the auto sector in general as low price induces to buy vehicles, but as the virus forced to do lockdown, everything comes to a standstill and no demand to auto also.

Further, stocks from FMCG and consumption will also benefit the most from sharp falling oil prices as raw material and packaging cost will be lower, Anand James, Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said.

He feels this fall is going to be a growth multiplier and in fact will be applicable to all sectors when the market will begin recovery.

In terms of stocks, Gaurav Garg recommended buying tyre maker Balkrishna Industries and paint company Asian Paints which are attractively valued.

According to Vineeta Sharma, Head of Research at Narnolia Financial Advisors, in the falling crude prices scenario, HPCL and Asian Paints are two stocks that may be accumulated now.

""The falling crude prices will reduce the burden on oil marketing companies on subsidy front. Also, HPCL's earnings visibility looks attractive on the back of its capex plans,"" she said.

""HPCL's expansion projects at Mumbai (from 7.5mtpa to 9.5mtpa + residual upgrade project, Rs 4,200 crore capex) and Visakh (from 8.3mtpa to 15mtpa, Rs210bn) refineries are on track for completion by FY21E. The company is available at a dividend yield of 3.5 percent. We recommend buy on HPCL with the target price of Rs 240,"" she added.

In case of Asian Paints, she said the company which began commercial operations of new plants at Vizag and Mysuru had attained 75 percent capacity utilization by Q3FY20.

""Volumes of the company may remain impacted due to poor global- domestic macros. However, falling crude will boost gross margins of the company and cost rationalization measures will further support profitability. ROE is expected to improve led by margin expansion and improving asset turnover. We recommend buy with target of Rs 2,060 per share,"" she added.

Asian Paints corrected 21 percent, Balkrishna Industries 45 percent and HPCL 32 percent from their highest closing of 2020.

In fact, the benchmark indices itself lost more than 37 percent from their record highs seen in January, which clearly indicated that valuations supressed to large extent.

AK Prabhakar feels Reliance Industries, the operator of world's biggest refinery complex, is also the major beneficiary of falling oil price as it buys crude in bulk for its refinery. The stock already corrected 44 percent from its 2020 high on concerns of COVID-19, impacting oil demand.

""Once the COVID-19 subsides, the demand along with benefits of IMO fuel regulations impact will improve benchmark gross refining margins (GRM),"" said Yes Securities.

RIL’s retail business has witnessed a very strong momentum in the past few years led by significant expansion in stores and an even stronger like for like growth across segments, it added.

""During FY19-22, we expect RIL to witness an earnings CAGR of 20 percent. Return on equity is likely to improve by 200bps and debt/equity is expected to reduce from 0.7x to 0.4x during the same period. Considering this, we find FY22E EV/EBIDTA of 6.3x attractive,"" the brokerage said, adding expected increase in ARPU and constant addition to its subscriber base will aid Jio business.

Gaurav Garg

The current mayhem in stock markets is due to global factors including the novel coronavirus pandemic. But this does not dictate the fundamentals of the Indian economy. Stock markets, at times, react with fear. Currently, there is some fear due to coronavirus which is expected to come down in few weeks.

The lower circuit in the Indian markets was triggered for the first time in 12 years on March 13, 2020 since the 2008 global financial crisis. Trading was halted after a circuit breaker within five minutes of trading session opening. However, Sensex and Nifty made recoveries immediately, which was the biggest intraday recovery by the markets.

This event has presented an opportunity to accumulate stocks for long term as most of the stocks are available to the investors at attractive valuations. However, fundamentals of the companies should also be considered before investing.

We would recommend the below mentioned stocks as some of the good bets in the near future:

IRCTC: Buy above Rs 1,270 | Stoploss: Rs 950 | Target: Rs 1,650 | Return: 34 percent

Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) has been one of the favorite picks of investors in the recent times.

Share price of IRCTC has lost 38 percent from its all-time high of Rs 1,995 on February 25 this year. The main reason for this fall was the fear due to coronavirus. The number of people travelling have also come down due to coronavirus fears.

However, there is no fundamental problem with this stock. The stock rose 203 percent until February 25, 2020 compared to its listing price of Rs 644. It delivered 511 percent returns compared to IPO issue price of Rs 320. It reported a 179 percent rise in net profit at Rs 205.80 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2019, against a net profit of Rs 73.59 crore in the corresponding quarter of last fiscal. Investors can buy this stock above Rs 1,270 with a SL of Rs 950 and target of Rs 1,650.

Asian Paints: Buy above Rs 1,820 | Stoploss: Rs 1,760 | Target: Rs 1,890 | Return: 5 percent

The overall trend of Asian Paints is bullish technically. Also, the stock is trading above its 100 and 200 DEMA. Asian Paints Limited reported a 20.2 percent rise in consolidated profit at Rs 764.43 crore compared with Rs 635.83 crore in the same quarter last year.

The company promoters have released pledge on equity worth 1.45 percent shareholding in the company from March 3-9, 2020. Investors can buy this stock above Rs 1,820 with a SL of Rs 1,760 and target of Rs 1,890.

Dixon Technologies (India): Buy above Rs 4,175 | Stoploss: Rs 3,760 | Target: Rs 4,650 | Return: 19 percent

Dixon Technologies has shown good results specially in consumer electronics, lighting and mobile business. In Q3FY20 net sales increased by 31.02 percent whereas bottom line surged by 54.67 percent.

The company seems to be optimistic for the current financial year due to new customers' acquisition, expansion in scale of operations and increase in original designer manufacturer mix. Investors can buy this stock above Rs 4,175 with a SL of Rs 3,760 and target of Rs 4,650.

Avenue Supermarts: Buy above Rs 2,175 | Stoploss: Rs 1,960 | Target: Rs 2,450 | Return: 16 percent

The overall trend of Avenue Supermarts Limited is bullish. The stock is trading above its 100 and 200 DEMA in daily as well as weekly charts. It reported 53.3 percent growth in Q3 FY20 profit. The growth was driven by lower tax cost, higher revenue and operating income.

Revenue from operations grew by 23.9 percent YoY to Rs 6,751.9 crore during the quarter that ended on December 2019. Including this stock in your portfolio would be beneficial considering the valuation at which it is available for investors now. Investors can buy this stock above Rs 2,175 with a SL of Rs 1,960 and target of Rs 2,450.

Muthoot Finance: Buy above Rs 818 | Stoploss: Rs 735 | Target: Rs 909 | Return: 13 percent

Muthoot Finance Limited reported a 66 percent rise in its consolidated net profit to Rs 803 crore for the third quarter ended December compared to Rs 485 crore in the corresponding period of 2018-19. Market capitalization of the firm rose to Rs 34,830 crore during this period.

It also reported a 35 percent rise in total income. Its loan portfolio registered a 50 percent increase in net profit. All the above factors indicate that the stock is sound fundamentally. Investors can buy this stock above Rs 818 with a SL of Rs 735 and target of Rs 909.

ICICI Direct's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paint’s Q3FY20 volume growth came in at 11%, in line with our estimates. However, value growth at 3% YoY was lower than our estimate of ~10% YoY mainly due to low realisation and high base of last year. The volume growth in the last three quarters (Q1: 15% YoY, Q2: 14% YoY) of FY20 has remained robust for the company owing to demand remaining intact from tier II & tier III cities and rural India (contributes ~50% in total domestic revenue). Change in product mix (skewed towards economy products category like distemper & putty) and a cumulative price cut of ~0.25% (1% YTD) in solvent based products weighed on overall realisation in Q3FY20. The management has reiterated that demand in the economic product category is growing much faster than premium category owing to declining unorganised pie post implementation of GST in rural India. EBITDA margin increased 100 bps YoY at 22% owing to better gross margin. We cut our revenue, earning estimate of FY21E by 6%, 4% YoY, respectively, and introduce FY22E estimates with volume CAGR of 13% in FY19-22E.

Outlook

We believe Asian Paint would record volume CAGR of 13% in FY19-22E supported by demand remaining intact in rural markets. The company is likely to maintain its leadership position in the decorative paint category without diluting EBITDA margin owing to its strong brand. We roll over our valuation to FY22E and maintain BUY rating with a target price of Rs 2050.

After hitting their fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,872.50, shares of Asian Paints closed 6.32 percent higher at Rs 1,867.40 on BSE on February 3.

The stock got traction after crude oil prices fell in the global markets.

Oil prices fell to their lowest in more than a year, dragged down by worries about lower demand from top crude importer China after coronavirus outbreak spread from there to around 20 countries, Reuters reported.

Brent crude was at $56.26 a barrel by 0926 GMT, down 36 cents. Prices dropped by more than $1 earlier in the session to $55.42, the lowest since January 2019.

With the gains of February 3, Asian Paints shares broke their losing run of the last two consecutive sessions.

For the December quarter, the company reported a 20.2 percent rise in consolidated profit at Rs 764.43 crore compared with Rs 635.83 crore in the same quarter previous year.

The Indian market witnessed a sharp surge in January ahead of the big event - Budget 2020 - pushing the S&P BSE Sensex beyond 42,000, and Nifty50 above 12,400 levels.

The expectations, which are powering the rally, are that Budget 2020 will be tilted towards stimulating growth. The measures expected to be rolled out include cut in personal taxes, and a possible cut in long term capital gains tax (LTCG).

The expectation is running high from the upcoming Union Budget to provide stimulus to revive the economy, and lay down the path for India to achieve $5-trillion GDP by 2024.

Most economists and analysts see the government missing out on the fiscal deficit target by at least 50 bps but that is mostly factored in by markets, but anything more than that could be fatal for the sentiment on the Street.

“A 50-60 bps slippage in the fiscal deficit target for FY20 is now the consensus. We believe markets are already building in the same. But anything beyond that is not a great outcome. We believe the market is focussing more on FY21,” Ritu Arora – CEO & CIO, Allianz Investment Management Singapore Pte Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“We hope to see FDI norms being relaxed meaningfully in sectors such as insurance. This will bring in large pools of capital to India as well as help in further developing and deepening the financial sector, which is essential for India to reach its 5 trillion dollar goal by 2025,” she said.

In Union Budget 2020-21, most analysts on D-Street expect the government to continue with its policy push to revive economic growth and demand by focusing on boosting disposable income and that is one of the prime reasons why we are seeing a rally in the small & midcap stocks.

In terms of sectors, the usual beneficiaries include infrastructure, agriculture, rural economy, automobiles, Make-in-India thrust, more on ease of doing business, employment generation thrust could gain focus from the Budget, suggest experts.

Other sectors could be defence, banking, auto, infrastructure and consumption which will be the key sectors to watch out for in Budget 2020.

“Given the expectations that the government would take measures to ease the demand-side concerns, we expect consumption both staple (FMCG) and discretionary (consumer durable goods, automobile, etc.) to hog the limelight for the upcoming Budget 2020,” Pankaj Bobade, Fundamental Research Head, Axis Securities Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“Infrastructure creation is expected to be another focus for the government given the need for better infrastructure; hence, infrastructure plays viz., capital goods, cement, metals, pipes and infrastructure companies viz., EPC players, road construction companies etc would also enjoy demand in the near term,” he said.

Investment in railway infrastructure, mass rapid transport is also going to be keenly watched out for in the upcoming budget.

We have collated a list of companies from different brokerage firms that are expected to benefit from Budget proposals:

Sharekhan picked 12 companies, which it thinks will be in focus in the run-up to the Union Budget and have the potential to give good returns in the long term.



Antique Stock Broking:

We expect increased allocation to various rural-centric schemes, along with strong Rabi season may help revive rural demand.

These measures if announced may accelerate earnings largely led by higher volume growth for all consumption linked stocks. Likely key beneficiaries are in Auto (M&M, TVS Motors, Bajaj Auto), consumer durable/electrical (Crompton Consumer, Voltas), Paints and other household linked stocks (Asian Paints), Consumer staples (HUL, Colgate, Dabur) and retail (Avenue Supermarket).

We have projected a 10% growth in FY21 capital expenditure including expenditure over road, highway and railways (in line with our estimate of 10% FY21 nominal GDP) because of the ongoing fiscal constraint.

Likely key beneficiaries are L&T, NTPC, UltraTech Cement, Adani Ports, Siemens, ConCor, Bharat Electronics, Honeywell Automation, Gujarat Gas, Solar Ind., KEC, Timken, APL Apollo, Birla Corp, BEML and KNR Construction.

Angel Broking

In the backdrop of the current slowdown we believe that fiscal slippage is necessary and will go a long way in boosting growth given that India doesn't have a twin balance sheet problem like 2013, said the brokerage firm.

Expert: Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities Ltd.

Investors can look at high dividend-yielding stocks such as ONGC, Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta which might pick up the pace if there is some relief on the personal tax front.

Asian Paints on January 22 reported a 20.5 percent growth in consolidated profit, in the December quarter, driven by lower tax cost and good operating performance.

The profit had increased to Rs 779.71 crore from Rs 647.28 crore during the same period last year.

Revenue from operations was at Rs 5,420.28, up 3 percent year-on-year.

The company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 7.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,189.4 crore, and margin expanded 96bps to 21.94 percent in the December quarter – both better than analysts’ estimates.

Here are key highlights from Asian Paints' conference call by Narnolia Financial Advisors:

The Paint industry remained impacted due to adverse macroeconomic conditions in the domestic economy which, in turn, impacted demand. The prevailing demand conditions and Budget 2020 will remain the key watch-out for the company.

Monsoon affect volume growth: The company’s domestic decorative business posted a low double-digit volume growth impacted on account of early Diwali and prolonged monsoon.

Economy range products perform well: The company’s economy range of products continued to perform well and will continue focusing on pushing the same strategy in the coming quarters. However, waterproofing and adhesive product range also grew well in 3QFY20.

Real estate slowdown: The home improvement (i.e. Kitchen & Sanitary) remained impacted due to real estate slowdown in project segment. However, retail segment witnessed good growth.

Improvement in industrial coatings JV: The automotive coating JV (PPG-AP) continues to remain affected due to slowdown, witnessed by the domestic automotive industry, while the industrial coatings JV (AP-PPG) witnessed demand improvement on sequential basis compared to the first two quarters led by demand in protective coatings segment. However, lower material prices and contained growth in overhead costs helped improve profitability of both these JVs.

International business: The company's international business remained impacted due to slowdown in Oman and Bangladesh, while Sri Lanka witnessed prolonged monsoon. However, the improvement in Egypt and Bangladesh neutralized the above impact.",334,0.363299685716629

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian Paints

APNT has reported 8th consecutive quarter of double digit volume growth (~11%) led by migration from unorganized players in entry level distempers and emulsions. Although near term demand conditions are challenging due to 1) slower growth of premium paints in urban metros and Tier-I cities and 2) Slowdown in auto, construction and real estate sector. We remain positive in the structural growth story due to 1) product portfolio straddling across price points 2) huge scope in entry level paints given deep distribution (2x nearest competitor) and success of new products at 15-20% lower prices. Although APNT has taken 1% cumulative price cuts in FY20, benign crude prices would enable 220bps margin expansion in FY20 and steady margins thereafter. We cut our EPS estimates of FY20,21 and FY22 by 1.5,2.5% and 0.4% respectively and estimate 18% PBT CAGR over FY20-22.

Outlook

We value the stock at 45xFY22 EPS of 40.3 and arrive at a target price of 1815 (Earlier Rs1822). Retain Accumulate.

He feels valuations are on the expensive side but growth prospective is still bright.

Asian Paints releases its December quarter scorecard on January 22 and most brokerages are expecting the numbers to be steady amid a slowing economy and a slump in demand.

Other than the numbers, investors will closely watch the demand scenario in urban as well as rural areas.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects a 3 percent year-on-year (YoY) volume growth off a high base. The brokerage expects Asian Paints to report net sales of Rs 5,452.8 crore for Q3FY20 against Rs 5,294 crore for the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year.

Gross margin and EBITDA margin percentages are expected to be at 42.8 and 20.7, respectively.

Motilal Oswal expects adjusted PAT of Rs 698.9 crore, up 8 percent YoY.

Kotak Securities foresees some moderation in decorative paints volume growth, in line with the broad-based slowdown in consumption and partly due to a high base.

It expects a 23.4 percent YoY growth in adjusted PAT to the tune of Rs 784 crore.

""We expect 50 bps QoQ and 200 bps YoY improvement in gross margin, aided by favourable RM trends. We expect a 180 bps YoY increase in reported EBITDA margin,"" the brokerage said.

Kotak's estimates show that on like-for-like (LFL) basis, adjusted for Ind-AS 116, EBITDA margin would be up 60 bps YoY, led by an increase in gross margin, partly offset by higher selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) and other expenses pertaining to new facilities (Vizag and Mysuru).

Kotak said it models a 25.2 percent effective tax rate (ETR) in India business (standalone) for Q3FY20. On LFL basis, net profit will increase 10 percent YoY (adjusted for ETR reset) and EBITDA would be up 10 percent YoY (adjusted for Ind-AS 116), Kotak said.

On the other hand, Edelweiss Securities anticipates revenue, EBITDA and PAT to grow about 7.8 percent, 8.3 percent and 16.5 percent YoY, respectively.

""For the quarter, we expect Asian paints to report nearly 10 percent YoY volume growth on a base of 22 percent (Q2FY20 saw 14 percent volume growth on a base of 11 percent),"" said Edelweiss Securities.

Price cuts in paints have been about 0.6 percent YoY, but Edelweiss believes effective translation, taking into account lower realisation and discounts, would be negative 2 percent.

On the cost of goods sold (COGS) front, prices of crude-linked raw materials like TiO2 and other monomers have been benign, which should lead to gross margin expansion of 130 bps YoY, said Edelweiss.

""Higher staff cost and other expenditure compared to the base quarter will lead to EBITDA margin expansion of merely 10 bps YoY. Lower effective tax rate of 25.2 percent announced by the government as against 34.1 percent in Q3FY19 will lead to PAT growing ahead of EBITDA,"" said Edelweiss Securities.

Brokerage firm Emkay Global's estimates show Asian Paints volume growth maybe around 10 percent but weak mix and discounts are likely to result in lower sales growth.

However, lower input prices and favourable comparables will drive strong margin expansion, Emkay said.

""We expect a 9.1 percent YoY rise in net sales, 17.1 percent jump in EBITDA, 156 bps YoY growth in EBITDA margin percentage and a 34.3 percent YoY jump in PAT,"" said Emkay Global.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has ordered an investigation into allegations made by JSW Paints, among the newest entrants in the country's paints industry, against Asian Paints, the largest player.

JSW Paints, part of the JSW Group, has alleged that its bigger peer has resorted to actions making use of its dominant position in the country's paints market, and also of cartelisation.

""The Commission is of the opinion that there exists a prima facie case which requires an investigation by the Director General...The Commission also directs the DG to complete the investigation and submit the investigation report within a period of 60 days...,"" the statutory body said in a statement on January 14.

Listing out instances, which JSW Paints alleged were against the provisions of the Competition Act, the company charged that Asian Paints had pressurised dealers to ""stop dealing with JSW Paints"".

""Asian Paints targeted dealers/distributors/retailers partnering with JSW Paints directing them to stop dealing with JSW Paints... dropping service levels by delaying supplies and deliveries, asked dealers to remove display of JSW Paints products from their retail shelves and dealer signboards,"" the Commission notes in its order of the allegations.

""The company is currently examining the order and will take appropriate legal recourse. The company will extend full co-operation to CCI in the matter,"" Asian Paints said in a statement.

JSW Paints, which was set up in 2016, had launched its products in most of the southern states. It is said to have faced 'problems' in Karnataka, Telangana and Tamil Nadu, so far.

Brent Crude oil prices have risen by about 10 percent since December and are expected to surpass crucial hurdles around $70/bbl tracking geopolitical concerns.

Crude Oil prices witnessed a steep rise on news of the assassination of a top Iranian general by the US in an airstrike at Baghdad airport which triggered risk-off sentiment in markets and pushed oil prices on the upside.

Experts are of the view that crude oil prices are likely to remain at elevated levels in the next few weeks and we could see Brent Crude surpassing $70/bbl in the short term that would result in high inflation in oil-importing countries like India.

“After easing of tension between the US and China, and output cuts undertaken by OPEC and its allies, crude oil prices were already rallying,” CARE Ratings said in a report.

“Now coupled with the US airstrike, price of Brent has the potential to increase and cross the $70/bbl mark in the coming few days, depending on the retaliation planned by the Iran government and the longevity of the feud is continued by both the countries,” it said.

Any increase in the price of crude oil is always going to be a cause of concern for India considering it imports more than 80 percent of oil requirements.

According to the CARE Rating report, in the current financial year, India has imported 4.5 mb/d (April-November) of crude oil and the import dependency based on consumption which has increased to 84.5 percent compared with it being 83.3 percent a year ago in the same period.

Jateen Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst (Commodity & Currency) at LKP Securities said that the recent tensions between the US and Iraq escalating strongly due to US airstrike killed key Iranian and Iraqi military personnel, raising concerns that escalating Middle East tensions may disrupt oil supplies.

Trivedi is of the view that Brent Crude can rally over $70/bbl and domestic MCX can touch 4,700 in this cross border tension.

Increase in crude oil is likely to impact current account deficit as well as the fiscal deficit, inflation trends, and could possibly increase the production cost of companies that use crude oil as raw material cost.

“OMCs (oil marketing companies), tyre and paint stocks will be impacted most with higher crude prices and may see correction,” Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor told Moneycontrol.

We spoke to various experts and collated a list of stocks that are likely to get impacted the most from a rise in crude oil:

Expert: Rajesh Palviya, Technical and Derivative Research Head, Axis Securities

Oil Exploration companies like ONGC, OIL India would benefit from any rise in crude prices. Other sectors that use crude oil as a raw material would have a negative impact on this surge in crude prices namely automobiles, OMCs, paints, plastics and packaging material.

Stocks that are likely to get impacted the most include Maruti Suzuki India, Bajaj Auto, HPCL, IOC, and Asian Paints.

Expert: Amit Gupta, Co-Founder, TradingBells.

ONGC, OIL India and oil exploration companies might get benefit from a rise in Crude oil prices whereas IT and Pharma companies may outperform if rupee sees further weakness.

Generally, OMCs, paints, aviation and financial stocks remain under pressure due to a surge in crude oil prices.

Expert: Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities.

ONGC and Oil India are likely to benefit the most from a rise in crude prices. Higher crude prices will entail higher price realizations for these players.

The Indian equity indices continued to consolidate on December 3 and ended on a flat note after a volatile session amidst mixed global cues. The Nifty50 index closed at 12,048, down 8 points.

Both the broader market indices - BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap underperformed the benchmark and declined 0.8 percent and 0.4 percent respectively.

The sectoral indices exhibited a mixed trend as Telecom, Metal and Energy were the biggest gainers, while Auto, IT and Healthcare were the biggest losers.

The weak Q2 GDP data and subdued auto sales numbers are likely to impact the investor sentiments in the short term. All eyes will now be on RBI monetary policy for economic revival measures going forward.

On the global front, investors are eagerly awaiting a positive outcome of the US-China trade negotiations which could strengthen the rally in the global markets. In addition, currency and crude price movement will continue to impact investor sentiments.

Indications are pointing towards some profit-taking initially but the bias would remain on the positive side.

We are eyeing 12,300 in Nifty and in case of any decline 11,800-11,900 zone, it would act as a cushion. Amid all, we expect broader markets to do well thus traders should focus more on the stock selection.

Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 3-7 percent return in the next 3-4 weeks:

Asian Paints Ltd: Buy | Target: Rs 1,800 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,700 | Upside 3.5 percent

Asian Paints is witnessing a rebound after spending nearly a week around the support area of 100-Days EMA on the daily chart.

It was a marginal profit taking phase and the chart pattern now indicates a resumption of the up move. We thus suggest initiating fresh longs in the given range of 1725-1735. It closed at 1738.25 on Dec 2, 2019.

Manappuram Finance Ltd: Buy | Target: Rs 168 | Stop-Loss: Rs 150 | Upside 7 percent

Manappuram Finance has retraced marginally from its record high in the last one month, after the sharp surge from roughly Rs 107 to over Rs 170 zone.

We believe that it is a healthy correction, offering fresh buying opportunities to those who had missed the chance earlier. We advise creating longs in the mentioned range of 154-156. It closed at 156.95 on Dec 2, 2019.

Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd: Sell Dec Futures | Target: Rs 48 | Stop-Loss: Rs 55 | Downside 6 percent

BHEL has been trading in a downtrend for the last several years and still there’s no sign of reversal. In line with the past instances of counter moves, it had rebounded sharply in October but couldn’t surpass the major hurdle of 200-Days EMA on the daily chart and gradually inching lower since then.

It has witnessed a fresh breakdown on Monday i.e. December 2 and is likely to see fresh decline ahead. We suggest creating fresh shorts within 52.50-53.50. It closed at 51.40 on Dec 2, 2019.

Warren Buffett once said, ‘""If you don't feel comfortable making a rough estimate of the asset's future earnings, just forget it and move on.""

Earnings growth is an important factor in determining the future price of a stock. And, the consistent growth in earnings despite a challenging environment, especially in the last 12 months, is worth a look.

There are as many as 10 stocks that have seen FY21 Earnings Per Share (EPS) upgrades in the last three out of four quarters in the BSE100 list, according to a report from Elara Securities.

The list includes names like Bajaj Finance, HDFC Life Insurance, ACC, Asian Paints, Nestle India, HPCL, BHEL, Federal Bank, NMDC, and Bharti Infratel.

The next big question in front of investors is – are they value buy? Well, experts feel that most of the stocks might be trading at rich valuations. But, given the growth potential, they could command higher valuations for some more time.

“Some of them are momentum buy where valuations are not cheap but earning momentum may continue like Bajaj Finance, HDFC Life Insurance, Asian Paints and Nestle while some of them provide value at current levels like ACC, HPCL, Federal Bank, BHEL, NMDC, and Bharti Infratel,” Amit Gupta, Co-Founder and CEO, TradingBells, told Moneycontrol.

“HPCL may try to bridge the valuation gap with BPCL whereas Federal Bank may attract investors as the worst phase is over for the counter. Bajaj Finance, HDFC life, Nestle and Asian paint may continue their rally as earnings growth is visible in these counters,” he said.

What is EPS?

Let’s also understand what is Earnings Per Share (EPS), and why is it important. When analyzing stocks on a fundamental basis, earning per share (EPS) is an important ratio which projects how much a shareholder earns on per share bought.

It is calculated by dividing the net profit by the number of outstanding shares. Earnings per share is the portion of a company's distributable profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock.

“Earnings per share serves as an indicator of a company's profitability which helps in comparing the companies and look for the company with high earning power. To find out whether the earning power of the company has improved or deteriorated EPS calculated over a number of years is helpful,” Ritesh Asher, Chief Strategy Officer at KIFS Trade Capital, told Moneycontrol.

“A steady growth in EPS indicates how eligible the company is in making money for its shareholders and also it showcases the performance of management of the company as how they are handling things in case of changes in profit and also managing the effect of the issuance of new shares,” he said.

EPS upgradation is positive news for the company and its shareholders led by a pickup in performance which are key drivers of the stock’s performance, Asher further added.

What should investors do?

The big question is if investors should press the buy or sell button based on EPS upgrades? Well, EPS is an important parameter when someone is analyzing the company based on fundamentals, but it should not be looked in isolation.

Experts feel that investors should track EPS of at least four-five years while other important parameters which one should include are Return on Equity (RoE), as well as Return on Capital Employed (RoCE).

“No doubt EPS upgrade is one of the most important factors to buy any stock but some other parameters should also be considered like valuation, ROE, ROCE and positioning of the market,” said Gupta of TradingBells.

“Sometimes earning upgrades come at the top of the earnings momentum in any stock or Industry but stocks fail to justify the same earning growth in the following years. Most importantly, the market is a forward-looking animal and most of the time all good or bad news is discounted in the price,” he said.

The Sensex already hit an all-time high, while the Nifty is approaching the same where some strong bears may try their hand in the 12,000-12,100 resistance zone with algorithm trading as it requires too much strength to take out all-time high, Amit Gupta, Co-Founder and CEO TradingBells, tells Moneycontrol's Kshitij Anand.

Q. Fresh record highs for the Sensex, while Nifty had a touch and go moment with 12,000 in the week gone by. Do you think Moody’s outlook change on Indian will impact sentiment?

A. There might be the minor sentimental impact of Moody's downgrade but the market may ignore it as rating agencies' reaction generally comes late and it seems the worst is behind us in terms of domestic problems.

Q. Will the Nifty be able to touch fresh highs in November given the fact it is near the crucial resistance 12,000-12,100 zone?

A. The Sensex has already hit an all-time while the Nifty is approaching the same where some strong bears may try their hand in 12,000-12,100 resistance zone with algorithm trading as it requires too much strength to take out all-time high.

Once 12,100 will be taken out then the market will get further momentum for an immediate target of 12,300. Technically, 11,880-11,850 is the first support which bulls will try to protect while 11,700 is the sacrosanct support mark to buy any dip.

Q. Data suggest that more than 50 percent of companies are trading at a discount to historical averages. Investors are looking for companies that are trading at a relatively cheaper valuation – can they look at buying stocks which are trading at a discount or is it better to stay with companies that are attracting momentum?

A. Some money may shift from expensive stocks to value stocks but some of the expensive stocks may continue their momentum where earning growth is still strong.

Britannia Industries, Asian Paints and Berger Paints are some stocks which may see some profit booking or consolidation as money may chase stock with better valuations but any dip in these quality stocks will attract further buying interest at lower levels.

Companies that are trading a significant discount may do well but this will not be the case for all companies because money will chase only those companies where earning growth is visible.

Q. We are in the last leg of the September quarter earnings. How is the journey so far for Indian Inc. and will there be more surprises on the downside?

Overall earnings season was mixed to positive where expectations were low. Consumption basket did better than expected as there was fear of a slowdown in retail consumption.

Most of the private banks posted inline or better than expected results while in the public bank basket only big boy State Bank of India comes up with strong earnings.

In IT pack Infosys HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra did well while TCS's earnings were below expectations. Most of the mainline auto companies posted inline or better than expected results.",510,0.23242097099622092

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian Paints

APNT has reported 7th consecutive quarter of double digit volume growth (~16%) led by migration from unorganized players in entry level distempers and emulsions (launch of Tractor Emulsion Spark and ACE Spark) and Putty segment. Although near term demand conditions are challenging due to 1) prolonged monsoons 2) slower growth of premium paints in metros and Tier-I cities and 3) Slowdown in auto, construction and real estate sector. We remain positive in the structural growth story due to 1) product portfolio straddling across price points 2) huge scope in entry level paints given deep distribution (2x nearest competitor) and 3) lower share of Automotive/ Industrial paints (5% of Consol sales) which faces near term headwinds.

Outlook

We value the stock at 45xFY22 EPS of 41.2 and arrive at a target price of 1855 (Earlier Rs1640 at 45xJune21 EPS). Retain Accumulate.

ICICI Direct's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints reported strong volume growth in the decorative segment (I-direct estimate: ~14% YoY) in Q2FY20, higher than our estimate of 12%. Volume growth was largely driven by demand staying intact in tier II, tier III cities with the early onset of the festive season. Change in product mix (skewed towards economy products category like distemper & putty) and a cumulative price cut of ~0.8% in solvent based products weigh on overall realisation in Q2FY20. The management guided for a possible pick-up in demand for premium category products in coming quarters. We believe this would help drive realisation growth, going forward. On the margin front, higher gross margin was partly offset by a surge in advertisement expenses and other expenses. Finally, PBT increased 13% YoY while sharp growth in PAT was largely on account of transition to new corporate tax rate structure.

Outlook

We believe despite extended monsoons, the company has recorded strong volume growth in Q2FY20 with margin expansion. We revise our earnings estimate up by 6% and 4% for FY20E and FY21E, respectively. We maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 2050/share.

Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is expected to grow 30.1 percent YoY to Rs 1,020.3 crore and profit after tax (PAT) may grow 31 percent YoY to Rs 662.9 crore, Edelweiss Securities said.

""Lower effected tax rate of 25.2 percent announced by the government, as against 32.8 percent in Q2FY19, will lead to PAT growing ahead of EBITDA,"" Edelweiss said.

Volume growth may have softened during the second quarter of FY20. Edelweiss expects Asian paints to report nearly 8 percent YoY volume growth on a base of 11 percent. Q1FY20 saw nearly 16 percent volume growth on a base of 12.5 percent.

The brokerage believes effective price hike translation for Asian Paints will be nearly 2 percent even as the price hike in the paints has been about 4 percent YoY.

On the COGS (cost of goods sold) front, prices of crude -linked raw materials like TiO2 and other monomers have declined sharply on YoY basis, which should aid in gross margin expansion that will flow through to the EBITDA margin.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects a 13 percent YoY growth revenue at Rs 5,242.1 crore, with nearly 9 percent volume growth in the domestic decorative business.

EBITDA can see a YoY rise of 25 percent to Rs 980.4 crore and the net profit may climb 10.8 percent YoY to Rs 560.8 crore.

""We note that crude prices were down 17.8 percent YoY and 9.7 percent QoQ in Q2FY20. The magnitude of price movement in crude derivatives is lower and comes with a lag vis-à-vis crude prices,"" said Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage firm expects gross margins of Asian Paints to expand 350bp YoY to 43.3 percent and operating margin is likely to expand 180bp to 18.7 percent, with EBITDA increasing 25 percent YoY.

Kotak Securities expects continued resilience in decorative paints volume growth, partly aided by unorganised-to-organised shift after July 2018 GST rate cut, especially in the low-value products.

""We model 14 percent YoY growth in domestic sales led by 12 percent volume growth and 2 percent price or mix-led growth,"" Kotak Securities said.

The brokerage firm anticipates a 37 percent (adjusted for Ind-AS 116) YoY growth in EBITDA on LFL (like for like) basis.

""Net profit growth would be much higher owing to the effective tax rate (ETR) cut and associated reversal of Q1FY20 taxes. We model 16.3 percent ETR in the India business (standalone) for Q2FY20, translating into about 25.2 percent ETR for the first half of FY20,"" said Kotak Securities.

Ajit Mishra

Markets settled with a cut of over half a percent last week amid mixed cues.

Weaker-than-expected GDP data combined with dismissal auto sales numbers triggered a sharp decline in the beginning. However, the US-China trade war truce and buying in select index majors provided relief in the following sessions and helped the Nifty pare some of its losses.

Finally, the Nifty failed to surpass the hurdle at 11,000 and settled at 10,946.20, down by 0.70 percent.

This week is also a holiday-shortened one and markets will be eyeing Index of Industrial Production and Consumer Price Index data, to be released on September 12.

Besides, global cues, movement of the crude and currency market trend will be on their radar as well. We reiterate our bullish yet cautious approach for this week as well.

A decisive break above 11,000 will help the Nifty to test 11,250-11,300 levels. In case of a decline, 10850-10,750 zone will provide the needed cushion, thanks to the existence of crucial moving average support (100 EMA) on the weekly chart. Meanwhile, volatility could remain high.

A list of top three stocks that could give 3-10 percent return in the next three-four weeks:

Asian Paints Ltd: Buy|LTP: Rs 1540.60| Target: Rs 1,595| Stop Loss: Rs 1,500|Upside 3.9 percent

After a marginal correction from its record high, Asian Paints has reached closer to the support zone of 50-day EMA on the daily chart.

Indications are in favour of marginal consolidation, followed by a rebound in the near future. Considering its chart pattern and overall upside trend, we expect a steady rise ahead. We suggest initiating fresh longs within Rs 1,525-Rs 1,535 range.

Biocon Ltd: Buy| LTP: Rs 233.45| Target: Rs 250| Stop-Loss: Rs 222|Upside 7.7 percent

Biocon witnessed correction after a breakdown from the consolidation range and tested the major support zone of the long-term moving average (200 EMA) on the weekly chart.

The stock has been consolidating around the same for one month and is likely to see a fresh surge in the days to come. We advise creating fresh longs in the mentioned zone of Rs 229-Rs 232.

Manappuram Finance Ltd: Buy| LTP: Rs 123.80| Target: Rs 136| Stop Loss: Rs 117| Upside 9.7 percent

Manappuram has been consolidating in a range for past one month while holding firm above the crucial support zone of 200 EMA on the daily chart.

On September 9, it surged strongly with a noticeable rise in volume, resulting in the formation of a fresh buying pivot.

Traders are advised to use this opportunity and initiate fresh longs in the given range of Rs 122-Rs 124. It closed at Rs 123.80 on September 9.

The demand for gold and silver has hit an all-time high, due to volatility in the Indian equity markets and concerns over the health of the domestic economy, Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director, Choice Broking, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts:

Q) Rupee breached 72/$ mark in the week gone by. Where do you see the currency headed in the near term, and what is causing the volatility?

A) We are expecting the rupee to trade mixed due to prevailing geopolitical tensions. In addition, the ongoing tensions in the Middle East leading to oil disruptions can weaken the rupee.

Also, Bullion prices have been strong owing to the above tensions which could limit any major downside in the INR.

Moreover, the demand for gold and silver has hit an all-time high, due to volatility in the Indian equity markets and concerns over the health of the domestic economy.

The Centre could come up with further new plans and policies such as additional GST rate cuts or relaxing direct taxes on corporates which could boost domestic investments and limit major weakness in rupee.

Moreover, the cost of exports for global buyers could be cheaper. The surplus money released by the RBI to the Centre could help in reviving the economy.

But then, the diversification of those investments/funds to which sectors is still a question of doubt which can keep the markets confused in the near term.

Amid brewing trade wars, fears of the global recession may keep the rupee choppy. In conclusion, the above factors are more likely to bring sideways to a bullish trend in the Indian Rupee with respect to the dollar.

Q) What does the rollover data suggest for September series? Do you think the market is likely to remain under pressure? Top stocks with long and short rollovers.

A) Rollovers of Nifty and Bank Nifty in August stood at 69 percent, and 66 percent respectively, compared to 74 percent, and 77 percent seen in the last series, while market-wide rollovers stood at 89 percent versus 91 percent in the previous month.

Cost of carry for both the indices was higher in comparison to their three-month average. For the September F&O series, we expect Nifty to witness wild swings.

September expiry starts with the maximum open interest build-up in Nifty call options, at 11,700CE, and for Nifty put options, at 11,000PE.

Top stock with long rollover include companies like Shree Cements, Castrol India, Union Bank of India, Bharat Forge, and Godrej Consumer Products.

Top stocks with short rollovers include companies like IDFC First Bank, NALCO, Indiabulls Housing, MCX, and Jubilant FoodWorks.

Q) Any big cues to watch out in September month which could dictate the trend?

A) Key event to be watched out will be the policy meeting outcome on the stress in the realty sector and any other such events for the revival in the domestic economy.

Till date, although the monsoon in totality is normal, there are still patches of a below-normal monsoon in most of the agrarian areas of the country.

So the progress of monsoon is important and will be keenly tracked. Apart from this any political development on Kashmir will have an impact on the market.

Internationally, the development related to the Sino-US trade war, Brexit and Hong Kong protest can bring some negative in the market.

Q) Nifty50 closed the week with gain but some profit-taking was seen towards the close of the week. What is leading to the nervousness on D-Street despite positive measures announced by the govt in the week gone by?

A) The market is not confident on the sentiment reversal post the measure announced by the government. Even the surplus fund distribution by the RBI to the government was not able to improve the sentiment.

These coupled with the uncertain global environment are the main reasons for the market notwithstanding at higher levels. The negativity in the market can be validated from the higher rollover of short position for the Sept. series.

Having said that, we feel that H2 of the fiscal will be relatively better than H1, reflecting an improvement in the general economy.

Q)-Top stocks which hit fresh 52-week high include HDFC AMC, Asian Paints, Bata India, Apollo Hosp, Dr LalPathlabs, and Berger Paints. Most of the names are companies with quality management – do you think TINA factor is playing in some of these stocks, and the momentum will go on for some more time?

A) HDFC AMC

The stock has performed well in the last one year after listing. The stock is trading above its 21 and 500-days simple moving averages, which show that there is more upside.

On the weekly chart, the stock has been trading in its upward rising wedge formation and is hovering near the breakout zone.

The RSI reading is at 72.43 level and gives positive crossover, apart from this, the RSI has formed symmetrical triangle and also trading above this formation, which points out a positive breath in the counter.

Resistance: 2,600-2,700 Support: 2,100-2,000

Asian Paints

The stock is continuously trading in an uptrend and has given a breakout above its horizontal trend line, which is placed at Rs 1,479 that indicates upside movement.

However, the stock has also given a breakout from its descending triangle formation and is now trading above this formation, which may see positive sentiment in the counter.

Resistance: 1,750-1,800 Support: 1440-1400

Bata India

The stock has started to trade around its all-time high, as the momentum dynamics has shifted to a new zone.

The stock has reached its uncharted territory with ample volume activity, which indicates a favourable condition in which supply can get absorbed by fresh demand. Therefore, we can expect further upside movement.

Resistance: 1,750-1,800 Support: 1,360-1,300

Apollo Hospitals

The Pharma Index is not performing these days and it will take time to do so. Apollo Hosp reached its all-time high but the stock is very volatile, and the next resistance level is around Rs 1,550-1,600, and supports are placed at Rs 1,420-1,355.

A moment indicator RSI is also trading sideways, with a negative crossover, which shows that the near-term trend remains bearish.

Dr Lal Pathlabs

The stock has been trading near support of its 21-day moving average on the daily chart, which suggest that the stock has a great potential.

Furthermore, the index has been formed a symmetrical triangle and is also trading above this formation which shows positive movement in the counter.

Cautious and tepid commentaries by several corporates raise concern for the further earnings downgrades. Thus Q2FY20 is also expected to be muted with a visible slowdown in discretionary spending all over, Yogesh Mehta, founder of Yield Maximisers, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts:

Q: Domestic and global cues point towards a possible recession across the globe which could, in turn, affect India's growth story. What are your views?

A: Fear of slowing US economy is rising day by day and the data also indicates India can’t remain immune for a longer time if the situation of the US and China trade tension intensifies further.

The new monster of inversion of yield curve emerged in the US bonds may see the ripple effect of slowing down in FII investment inflows in India that can be seen as not encouraging for Indian markets.

Q: How did India Inc. fare in the June quarter earnings?

A: Q1FY20 corporate earnings disappointed the street, Nifty PAT grew merely 5 percent YoY, compared to an estimate of 12 percent.

Cautious and tepid commentaries by several corporates raise concern for the further earnings downgrades. Thus Q2FY20 is also expected to be muted with a visible slowdown in discretionary spending all over.

Q: Top five outperformers and underperformers from the Q1 season.

A: Outperformers

UltraTech Cement:

UltraTech Cement reported an all-time high EBIDTA growth led by realisation beat and deleveraging focus.

Asian Paints: With 24 percent EBIDTA growth aided by high double-digit volume growth, this stock stands out as a clear outperformer.

Sun Pharma: EBIDTA growth of 24 percent was largely in-line with US sales. Ilumya is gaining traction and normalise R&D spending from Q2 will support the stock.

Zee Entertainment: The media company reported 47 percent YoY jump in the domestic subscriptions with expansion in margins, which is a positive sign.

Underperformers:

Tata Motors: The global automaker disappointment the Street, weighed down by sharp margin contraction in JLR and India business, and even guidance was revised down to 3-4 percent for FY20.

ONGC: PAT was down due to one-off provision and higher interest cost.

SBI: Higher credit cost and higher slippages.

Tata Steel: Weak margins, weak outlook and capex cut by 25percent. The net profit was down 53 percent.

Q: FIIs have been pulling out money from Indian markets consistently since July while MF absorbed most of that selling. But, do you think the momentum will continue?

A: FIIs sold equities worth Rs 15,000 crores in July. Nifty corrected about 8.5 percent from all-time highs of 12,103.

FII selling momentum may continue if current economic pressures and weak earnings persist.

Q: With global recession looming large, gold is all set to clock Mount 40K on MCX. Do you think it is the right time to invest in gold or gold ETF?

A: The way US-China trade war is getting intensified, due to tumbling bond yields they are no more attractive, hence, gold is catching momentum as safe heaven (asset class). If INR weakens further and international gold price rises further one can still invest in gold.

Q: Auto sector has been under pressure with more firms opting for shutdowns. Do you think this sector could produce wealth creators if someone buys the stocks at current levels with a time frame of 2-3 years?

A: Demand for auto has tapered down and the auto index is back to its 2014 levels which are providing an opportunity for investors but at current levels, it is like a half glass full and half glass empty.

However, with 2-3 year timeframe, staggered investment in the leaders of the sector is recommended but not as a wealth creator.

The global investment bank has said that markets could be nearing a bottom.

“We are getting to a bottom in share prices, as our valuation and sentiment indicators suggest, but risks remain on the horizon for the real economy and a slowing global economy,” Morgan Stanley said in a report.

The risk-to-reward ratio favours buying equities, but a V-shaped recovery in stocks depends on the actions of policymakers, says the August 6 report. Investors with a bit of patience will likely be rewarded well in the next 12 months.

The S&P BSE Sensex has fallen around 9 percent from its record high of 40,312.07 touched in early June. The market has continued to head south, weighed down by budget proposal of higher tax on the super rich, selling by foreign investors, slowdown in growth and escalating trade war between the US and China.

Despite the selloff, Morgan Stanley maintains its base-case scenario of 45,000 on the Sensex by June 2020, and a bull-case of 50,000. Its bear case possibility sees the Sensex at 35,000 by June 2020.

“Indian equities look attractive in a relative context amid subdued oil prices, global trade tensions and better relative valuations in what is a low-return world,” says the note.

It, however, says policy action is still needed to protect India’s relative performance, which has sunk since the budget was presented on July 5.

From a portfolio perspective, Morgan Stanley likes financials, consumer discretionary and industrials, both large-and midcaps.

Policymakers could turn to measures such as strategic divestments of public-sector companies, recapitalisation of public-sector banks, trade deal with the US and other countries, rationalisation of GST rates, a new Direct Tax Code, infrastructure spending and fiscal prudence, and a moratorium on higher taxation for FPI trusts, Morgan Stanley says.

Mazhar Mohammad

Market participants were delighted when Narendra Modi returned to power with an absolute majority, resulting in the euphoric upmove at the bourses and the new milestone of 12000 levels on the Nifty.

But, the euphoria didn’t last long. The dichotomy between earnings and market outperformance increasingly became wider since 2014 and to most of our fundamental fraternity, earnings recovery consistently remained two-three quarters away since 2015.

We are in 2019 and there is no reason to believe that earnings will turn the corner in the next six months, especially when the global economy appears to be staring at a recession.

With an absolute majority, market participants expected bold reforms from the government but budget appears to have disappointed on this front.

Moreover, super-rich tax that also hit foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and a proposal for equity dilution norms up to 35 percent in favour of public appear to have spooked the sentiment apprehending more supply of stock from large caps where promoter holdings are highest.

In between, NBFC crisis deepened with some contagion impact as companies such as DHFL, Essel Group subsidiaries, Cox & Kings, Reliance Home, Sintex Industries started defaulting on debt obligations.

Meanwhile, a slump in auto sales, fall in the savings rate and a rise in unemployment are some of the factors hinting at a slowdown.

Why investors may remain cautious

Though Modi has come back with a bigger mandate, investors may remain cautious in his second innings. In 2014, markets grandly welcomed the change of leadership at the Centre, looking at the “Gujarat model” of development.

But, in his first innings, he hit the market participants with demonetisation, scratchy implementation of GST and brought back long-term capital gains tax, making his economic moves somewhat unpredictable.

Controversy surrounding growth statistics of the government, which are not capturing ground-level realities, have only made investors cagey.

Hence, investors may rightly wait to see earnings recovery with strengthening investment cycle, as corporate profits since 2014 have remained almost flat while GDP slowed down on a year-on-year basis.

Largecaps to lead next leg of fall?

Our analysis of ‘Time Cycles’ is suggesting that markets may be stuck in a prolonged sideways phase and the best of the rallies may not be witnessed till March 2020 quarter.

Till then, we may see a range-bound move with negative bias. In terms of levels 10,850–10,740, as of now, looks like a strong support zone on the long-term charts.

A major part of the market—between 60-70%—is in a bear phase from the highs of 2018. Hence, if markets break down further then largecaps are likely to come under pressure which are trading at expensive valuations as there is uncertainty about growth.

Market favourites like Bajaj twins, consumption stocks like HUL, Asian Paints etc. are trading well above 50x PE ratio without giving any valuation comfort. Our analysis of Nifty components shows:

a. Three stocks are trading with 3 digit earnings multiple i.e. with a PE of more than 100x

b. Three stocks are trading with a PE between 70-99x

c. Six stocks are trading with a PE between 50-69x

d. Six stocks are trading with a PE between 30-49x

Eighteen of the 50 companies in the Nifty50 may remain more vulnerable for a fall as valuation comfort is clearly missing.

Sample illustration:

Near term trends

If the market stabilises above 11,200 levels then a pullback can be witnessed towards 11,600 kind of levels in the best case.

Contrary to this, a breach of 11,200 will eventually drag down the indices towards the strong support zone of 10,850-10,740 on the long-term charts.

Overall, as the upsides look limited to the zone of 11,500–11,600 levels, traders are advised to prune their portfolios by making use of this rally.

ICICI Direct's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints’ (APL) strong Q1FY20 performance was led by solid growth in decorative paint volume (I-direct estimate: up 15% YoY). Volume growth was led by strategic dealer push, low base (due to GST led de-stocking by dealers) and intact demand from rural India. The impact of price hike was largely negated by a change in product mix (skewed towards economy products category like distemper & putty). The company has taken a price cut of ~0.4% in solvent based products. Despite this, gross margins improved marginally by 30 bps YoY (~200 bps QoQ). The major saving came in from fall in other expenses as percentage of sales (~87 bps YoY, ~300 bps QoQ). As a result, EBITDA margin increased 136 bps YoY to 22.5% (higher than our estimate of 18%). The strong operating performance helped negate the impact of higher non-operating cost like depreciation, interest in Q1FY20, resulting in 18% YoY PAT growth. We believe APL’s volume growth will remain higher at ~14% supported by strong demand from tier II, tier III cities, driving revenue at a CAGR of 15% in FY19-21E.

Outlook

We model revenue, earning CAGR of 16%, 23%, respectively, led by ~14% volume growth. We believe pressure on gross margin (due to change in product mix coupled with higher raw material cost) will ease, going forward, supported by a change in mix. However, at the current multiple, the stock offers limited upside. Hence, we change our rating from BUY to HOLD with a revised target price of Rs 1550/share.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian Paints

APNT has posted ~20% volume growth in domestic decorative business aided by sustained migration from unorganized segment, lower trade inventory in base quarter and channel filling led by dealer promotion schemes. Slowdown in demand is impacting the demand for automotive and industrial coatings, and we expect moderation in volume growth for domestic decorative paints in the coming quarter. Margin outlook remain positive given soft crude prices and favorable USD/INR, however gains from lower freight from new units will be partly neutralized by higher overheads.

Outlook

We increase EPS estimates by 2.3-2.6% and now estimate CAGR of 14% in revenue and 20.5% in Adj. PAT over FY19-21. We value the stock at 45xJune21 EPS of 33.8 and arrive at a target price of 1533 (Earlier Rs1433). Retain Accumulate.

Benign raw material prices, however, supported the margins for the entire coatings business, and Ind-AS implementation has no impact on gross margin of the group, he added.

At the operating level, consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 24.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,156.2 crore and margin expanded 130bps YoY to 22.5 percent.

Numbers were ahead of analyst estimates. Profit was expected at Rs 545 crore on revenue of Rs 4,850 crore and EBITDA was estimated at Rs 900 crore with margin at 18.6 percent for the quarter, according to a poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18.

KBS Anand said in the international operations, key units like Egypt and Sri Lanka continued to witness challenging business conditions impacting the overall performance.

Asian Paints is expected to show subdued performance in bottomline on weak operating margin but revenue growth could be in double digits on volume support in the quarter ended June 2019.

According to brokerages, profit may fall in single-digit with margin contraction of more than 100bps year-on-year in Q1, but sequential growth could be strong.

""We estimate 9.2 percent decline in adjusted PAT for the quarter as higher depreciation from two new plants kick in,"" Motilal Oswal said, adding operating margin is likely to contract 250bp to 17.4 percent, with EBITDA declining 2.9 percent YoY.

The brokerage expects gross margins to contract 200bp YoY to 41.2 percent.

Kotak said it expects 160 bps YoY decline in EBITDA margin led by 70 bps drop in gross margin, higher SG&A and other expenses pertaining to recently commissioned Vizag and Mysuru facilities, but it expects healthy sequential improvement in EBITDA margin aided by favourable raw material trends.

The brokerage sees 3.4 percent year-on-year fall in profit but sequentially the same may grow 14 percent with margin expansion of 192bps.

Crude prices were down 8.1 percent YoY (up 8.4 percent QoQ) in Q1FY20. The magnitude of price movement in crude derivatives is lower and comes with a lag vis-à-vis crude prices.

On the topline front, among brokerages, ICICI Securities looked more optimistic saying Asian Paints is likely to record sales growth of around 13 percent YoY in Q1 led by volume growth of around 11 percent YoY.

According to Kotak, revenue could rise 11 percent YoY led by 8 percent volume growth and 3 percent price/mix-led growth. Motilal Oswal and Prabhudas Lilladher also expect similar kind of growth levels.

Key issues to watch out for would be demand scenario across urban and rural areas, market share trends, outlook for key raw materials, commentary on pricing action, timeline on profitability in the Sleek and Ess Ess business, and business challenges improvement in international markets like Egypt, Bangladesh and Ethiopia.",334,-0.1844352066516876

ICICI Direct's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints’ (APL) profitability during Q4FY19 was largely hit by a change in product mix. The company reported volume growth of ~11% (I-direct estimate: 13%) largely driven by economy product range such as Distemper and Putty. Though the company took a price hike of ~6% in FY19, the change in product mix restricted value growth. As a result, gross margin declined ~170 bps YoY. In addition to this, higher fixed cost associated with new plants weigh on EBITDA margin, which declined ~233 bps YoY at 16.4%. Flattish PAT is attributable to higher depreciation and lower EBITDA margin during Q4FY19. We believe APL’s volume growth will remain higher at ~13% supported by strong demand from tier II and tier III cities, driving revenue at a CAGR of 15% in FY19-21E.

Outlook

We model revenue, earning CAGR of 15%, 17%, respectively, led by ~14% volume growth. We believe pressure on gross margin (due to change in product mix coupled and higher raw material cost) will ease, going forward, supported by price hikes. We maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 1535/share.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian Paints

We cut our EPS estimates for FY20 and FY21 by 6.3%-6.9% on the back of 1) uncertain demand environment in domestic market 2) deterioration in sales mix with higher sales of Putty, Tractor Distempers and emulsions 3) sensitivity of demand during election period 4) margin volatility due to INR depreciation and fluctuations in crude prices and 5) challenging environment in International business. We remain positive in APNT's structural growth story due to 1) likely benefits of GST rate reduction given ability to straddle through price points and deep distribution 2) strong pricing power given 7.4% price increase since March'18 and 3) lower share of Automotive/ Industrial paints which will face more pressure in near term.

Most brokerage firms maintained their rating on Asian Paints post its March quarter results but slashed target prices as margins took a hit.

Asian Paints reported fourth-quarter earnings on May 9 that missed analysts estimates on weak operating income.

Consolidated profit was lower by 1.7 percent year-on-year at Rs 487 crore in the quarter ended March 2019. CNBC-TV18 poll estimated profit of Rs 570 crore and revenue of Rs 5,200 crore. EBITDA was expected at Rs 958 crore and margin at 18.4 percent for the quarter.

Revenue from operations increased 11.7 percent YoY to Rs 5,018 crore in Q4 from Rs 4,492.30 crores with decorative business registering double-digit volume growth in India.

Here’s what brokerage firms recommend on Asian Paints post Q4 results:

CLSA: Sell| Target cut to Rs 1285 from Rs 1400

CLSA maintained its sell rating on Asian Paints post Q4 results and reduced its target price to Rs 1,285 from Rs 1,400 earlier.

The Q4 results were an all-around miss. The management outlook was cautious. The volume growth was impacted by an inferior mix.

Increased input prices and higher marketing spend are some of the factors which impacted the margins. The global investment bank slashed EPS estimates by 1-3% for FY20-21.

Macquarie: Outperform| Target cut to Rs 1,470 from Rs 1,580 earlier

The key positive from Q4 was continuation of double-digit volume growth. The key negative was margin pressure due to higher A&P spend, as well as provisions.

Credit Suisse: Neutral| Target cut to Rs 1,425 from Rs 1,500

Credit Suisse maintained its neutral rating but slashed target price to Rs 1,425 from Rs 1,500 earlier.

The company recorded healthy volumes at the cost of a large margin miss. The global investment bank slashed FY20/FY2e EPS estimates by 6-9 percent.

The volume growth was healthy, but realisation growth was only 2 percent compared to the price hike of 6 percent.

Asian Paints, one of the largest paint companies in India, is expected to report healthy earnings growth in March quarter led by price increase, volume growth and cost rationalisation. The company will announce the numbers on May 9.

Profit is likely to grow more than 15 percent year-on-year driven by operating income, revenue growth and higher tax rate in the base quarter.

""Demand momentum continues post GST rate reduction. Recent price increases in Oct'18 and Dec'18 would enable margin expansion,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher that expects 18.5 percent YoY growth in profit for the quarter ended March 2019.

Motilal Oswal estimates 17.8 percent adjusted PAT growth for the quarter while ICICI Securities said margin expansion coupled with strong sales

growth would result in strong PAT growth of 27 percent YoY at Rs 629 crore.

Revenue growth could also be in double digits during the quarter led by strong volume growth.

""Asian Paints is likely to record sales growth of around 17 percent YoY in Q4FY19 led by volume growth (includes industrial paint) of around 13 percent YoY,"" ICICI Securities said.

Kotak, which expects 18.7 percent growth in revenue, said it modelled 20 percent YoY growth in domestic sales led by 16 percent volume growth and 4 percent price/mix-led growth.

At the operating level, price hike of products and lower oil prices may help the company report strong operating income and margin expansion. Crude prices fell 5.7 percent YoY and 6.7 percent QoQ in Q4FY19.

""Price hikes in paints have been around 7 percent YoY; however, considering unfavourable product mix (higher putty sales), the effective price hike will be around 3-4 percent YoY. Prices of TiO2 (raw material) and other monomers have declined from peak; this, coupled with price hike and stabilising INR, should aid sequential gross margin expansion,"" said Edelweiss that expects 17.5 percent EBITDA growth YoY.

Kotak expects 150 bps YoY expansion in EBITDA margin aided by easing raw material costs (broadly flat gross margin on YoY basis), tight cost control and operating leverage. EBITDA growth could be 28.2 percent YoY.

Key issues to watch out for would be volume growth trends and demand scenario in urban and rural geographies; market share trends; outlook for raw materials; and commentary on pricing action.",382,0.999999696558172

The December quarter results reported by India Inc. were a mixed bag, but largely on the positive side and that is one reason we have not seen any major knee-jerk reaction in equity market as well.

Of the 34 Nifty companies that have announced their earnings, 25 have either met or exceeded consensus estimates on both the PAT and EBITDA front. The earnings upgrade/downgrade ratio is over 1, Motilal Oswal said in a report.

Among the Nifty constituents, Maruti Suzuki, UltraTech Cement, Yes Bank, SBI, IOC, Bharti Airtel and NTPC missed PAT estimates, while L&T, Axis Bank, ITC, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Reliance Industries and HCL Tech exceeded expectations.

“The December quarter earnings have been a mixed bag. We believe banks (both private and PSU banks) delivered yet another strong QoQ performance with improved asset quality and strong credit growth,” Jayant Manglik, President Religare Broking told Moneycontrol.

“Further, sectors like FMCG, IT and Capital Goods performed largely in-line with estimates with margin pressure witnessed across these sectors. However, the Auto companies’ results so far, have disappointed with pressure witnessed on volume growth as well as on margins,” he said.

Weak margins have impacted earnings for the 52/100 BSE-100 companies that have reported their results for the quarter ended December, Citigroup highlighted in a report.

Earnings expectations for FY19E have seen downgrades on a year-to-date (YTD) and now stand at 12-14% YoY for NIFTY. The global investment bank maintains its Sensex target at 39,000 (16x Mar-20 P/E).

Significantly more companies ‘beat’ earnings than ‘missed’. As many as 28 out of 52 ‘beats’ expectations compared to 14 out of 52 which ‘missed’. Similar trends across Revenue/EBITDA performance as well.

Among sectors, materials (cement, base metals) and energy (better than expected refining performance) sector positively surprised expectations while consumer discretionary (auto) and utilities have disappointed the most, said the Citi report.

Here is a list of 10 stocks where global brokerage firms raised their target price post December quarter results:

IGL: Buy| Target raised to Rs 330 from Rs 315

Deutsche Bank maintained a buy rating on IGL post December quarter results but raised its target price to Rs 330 from Rs 315 earlier.

The global investment bank also increased FY20-21 earnings estimates by 3 percent. It forecast 18 percent CAGR for FY18-20 EPS, driven by a 14 percent CAGR rise in volumes. The company is well placed to benefit from expansion in new areas.

Tech Mahindra: Outperform| Raised target to Rs 950 from Rs 925

Credit Suisse maintained its outperform rating on Tech Mahindra and raised its target price to Rs 950 from Rs 925 earlier.

The IT major reported a 13 percent sequential rise in Q3 profit at Rs 1,203 crore. The company reported 27.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit.

After many quarters of sluggishness, the mainstay of telecom and communications vertical reported a 2.6 percent growth in revenues during the reporting quarter over the preceding one, while the enterprise segment grew 4 percent.

The telecom story has started to pan out. It is a well-placed stock despite good performance, said the note. The valuations look reasonable at current levels.

Marico: Outperform| Raised target to Rs 400 from Rs 380 earlier.

Credit Suisse maintained its outperform rating on Marico post December quarter results and raised its target price to Rs 400 from Rs 380 earlier.

The FMCG major reported a steady Q3 and looks poised for a strong margin expansion in FY20.In terms of products, Parachute leads growth despite not dropping prices. The gross margin is poised to see a Year-on-year (YoY) expansion in FY20.

Aditya Birla Fashion: Buy| Target raised to Rs 265 from Rs 240 earlier

CLSA maintained its buy on Aditya Birla Fashion but raised target price to Rs 265 from Rs 240 earlier.

Strong Pantaloons same-store-sales (SSS) growth came as a surprise. The Q3 revenue was up 23 percent driven by strong SSS growth. Margin expanded even with a contraction in gross margin and higher A&P spend, said the note. The innerwear business continues to grow rapidly. The global investment bank raised FY19 PAT estimates to Rs 1,73.6 crore from Rs 114.6 crore.

Titan Company Ltd: Outperform| Target raised to Rs 1,175 from Rs 935

Credit Suisse upgraded Titan to outperform from neutral post the earnings and raised target price to Rs 1,175 from Rs 935 earlier.

The global investment bank also raised earnings estimates by 3-10 percent. It sees tailwinds for the stock from a strong wedding season. Higher gold prices aid an already strong growth trajectory, said the note.

State Bank of India: Buy| Target raised to Rs 380 from Rs 370 earlier

CLSA retained its buy call but raised the target price to Rs 380 from Rs 370 earlier.

SBI is the preferred pick among PSUs, said the note from CLSA. The profit was ahead of estimates which was aided by higher treasury gains. The key positive was the decline in slippages.

Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd: Outperform| Target raised to Rs 3200 from Rs 2850

CLSA retained outperform rating on the company and raised target price to Rs 3,200 from Rs 2,850 earlier.

The cost controls continue to deliver, and a revival in the US growth in FY20 will be a key catalyst. The earnings beat was largely driven by cost-control initiatives.

The US sales improved by 4 percent on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis and US pricing dynamics remained stable. The global investment bank increased FY19-21 EPS estimates by 2-9 percent.

ICICI Bank: Outperform| Target raised to Rs 460 from Rs 416

Macquarie maintained outperform rating on ICICI Bank and raised the target price to Rs 460 from Rs 416 earlier.

The private sector lender displayed a strong asset quality performance, while other operational parameters were stable. The management foresees FY20 credit costs between 85 bps and 125 bps. It is a preferred play on the ‘normalisation of credit costs’ theme, said the report.

Asian Paints: Outperform| Target raised to Rs 1580 from Rs 1180 earlier

Macquarie upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral earlier and also raised its target to Rs 1,580.

The volume growth picks up significantly, and the volume growth outlook has also improved which is a big positive. The recent price increases with falling input costs will improve margins.

The global investment bank raised FY19-21 EPS estimates by 7-16 percent. However, the full effect of lower GST rates yet to play out.

Havells India: Outperform| Raised target to Rs 775 from Rs 720 earlier

CLSA maintained an outperform rating on Havells India but raised its target price to Rs 775.

The revenue growth surprised across categories. Large channel inventory in the AC industry remains a concern. Revenue from switchgear division was Rs 416.2 crore as against Rs 344.3 crore in the third quarter of the financial year 2017-18.

The cable division revenue grew to Rs 820.3 crore as compared to Rs 625.6 crore in the year-ago period.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian Paints

We increase our FY19 and FY20 EPS by 6.9-6.7% as APNT has posted ~24% volume growth in domestic decorative business, first 20% growth number after 3QFY11. Although sustenance of the same is yet to be tested given benefit of low base and late Diwali this year and GST rate reduction in 3Q. APNT has given a cautiously optimistic outlook as sales growth will remain sensitive to overall demand and elections. Margins in the near term will be a function of USD/INR, crude price volatility, sales mix and stabilization of production in new units at Mysore and Vizag.

Outlook

We estimate CAGR of 14.7% in revenue and 17.9% in Adj. PAT over FY19-21. We value the stock at 45xDec20 EPS of 32.4 and arrive at a target price of 1460 (Earlier Rs1300). Retain Accumulate.

Dolat Capital's research report on Asian Paints

APL reported a strong double-digit volume growth of +20%, due to a shift in the festive season to Q3 in FY19, from Q2 in FY18. However, GM contracted, as it was adversely affected by higher price inventory of crude oil in the beginning of Q3. We believe that volume will continue to grow in double-digits, due to favorable volume base in rural market. In addition, ongoing government investments in rural infrastructure, and house construction in rural areas should benefit the company more than its peers (50% revenues attributed from rural). The price hikes implemented in October and December’18, should help boost revenues in the ensuing quarters. Further, the decline in crude oil prices and stable rupee are likely to increase margins in the near term. We are optimistic about the paint industry, considering an expected shift from the unorganised to organised sector in the long run. APL, a leader in the category, is likely to benefit the most from the shift. We revise our EPS estimates upward for FY19E and FY20E to ` 24.3 and ` 28.6, respectively, to factor in Q3 performance and favorable working conditions.

Outlook

We have introduced FY21E EPS estimates to ` 33.6. Maintain ACCUMULATE, with a revised TP of ` 1,513 (45x FY21 EPS.

Increased volatility and challenging business conditions marked the quarter gone by.. On the domestic macro front, growth trends still remain uncertain and the volatility in crude prices and exchange rates have only added to the uncertainty. After witnessing a significant increase in crude prices and a sharp fall in the rupee till the middle of the quarter, the later part of the quarter saw respite in terms of declining crude prices and rupee appreciation.

Please note that the figures for the previous year have been suitably adjusted to bring them in line with post GST financials.

Business Review – DECORATIVE:

The Decorative business registered high double-digit volume growth in the third quarter and delivered strong performance across regions. Post reduction of GST rate from 28% to 18% effective 27th July, we immediately passed off the entire GST benefit to consumers and decided not to pass on the raw material inflation, to be in compliance with the anti-profiteering provisions. However, with continued input cost prices due to the fall in rupee as well as increase in raw material prices, we have taken two price increases in the third quarter; 2.35% from October 2018 and another 1.7% from December 2018 to recover gross margins to an extent.

Business Review – INDUSTRIAL:

In the industrial business, the Automotive coatings JV (PPG-AP), witnessed good growth in the General Industrial segment. However, the Auto OEM segment witnessed subdued growth on back of fall in production across auto OEMs. The Industrial Coatings JV (AP-PPG) continued to grow well led by good performance in Protective coatings and the Powder coating segment. Both the businesses continued to face pressure from rising raw material prices and the price increases implemented in the market have not been enough to recover the margins fully.

Business Review – INTERNATIONAL:

In the international portfolio major units like Egypt, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka continued to face challenging business conditions. In Ethiopia, the third quarter saw a bit of pick-up as the unit was able to secure forex for its raw material imports. The greenfield operations in Indonesia continued to progress on its planned trajectory.

Business Review – HOME IMPROVEMENT:

Both the businesses in the Home Improvement space, continue to scale up at the planned levels with expansion in network and enhancement in the product portfolio. Both these businesses have done reasonably well.

CAPEX:

As informed in the last quarter, the first phase of the plant at Mysuru, Karnataka was commissioned as per plan in the month of September 2018 and the plant is progressing well on its stabilization. The first phase of the plant at Vizag, Andhra Pradesh is also set to be commissioned this quarter. The total Capex plan for the standalone operations for the current year is about Rs 1,000 crores including spends of about Rs 800 crores on the two new plants.

GOING FORWARD:

As mentioned earlier, fall in crude prices and appreciation in rupee towards the later part of the third quarter has provided some respite on the raw material cost front. However, we will need to monitor the demand conditions which would continue to remain uncertain given the upcoming busy election season. In the international markets, difficult business conditions in some of the key units continue to be a cause of concern.

Thank you, everyone. We are happy to take any questions you may have.

Moderator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Abneesh Roy from Edelweiss. Please go ahead.

Abneesh Roy: In Q2 Distemper had done quite well because of the GST rate cut. Now in Q3 normally Emulsion does well because of the festive-related seasonality. So, if I take off the festive-related impact, has the buoyancy in Distemper been maintained or it has slowed down?

Management: We maintained to an extent. You got to remember that there is a later Diwali this year compared to previous year. So, comparing quarter-on-quarter is not perfectly okay in our business.

Abneesh Roy: In terms of the region-specific you have been saying East India is growing the fastest while South India was a laggard. So, obviously in this quarter Kerala would have benefited you a lot. So, my question is, has Kerala seen in terms of percent of revenue double digit kind of contribution?

Management: All the regions have done well and I do not think Kerala has done exceptionally better than any other region.

Abneesh Roy: But in terms of growth it will be quite high right because lot of reconstruction, repainting would have happened. So, on YoY basis would not Kerala have outperformed the overall reported volume growth?

Management: No.

Abneesh Roy: Lastly on the Home Improvement side, I am seeing ESS ESS in the last four quarters has been in that Rs.46, 49 crore and quarter-on-quarter there is a dip. So, earlier what used to happen, Ess Ess used to grow faster than Sleek, now last two quarters Sleek is growing faster and quarter-on-quarter dip in Ess Ess, in spite of festive and other home improvement companies which have come out with numbers, they have seen a very strong volume growth. So, what is happening in Ess Ess, what is the issue.

Management: There is no real issue. The growth is reasonably good, marginally lower than what we expected in this quarter, but we are reasonably confident that the trajectory continue.

Abneesh Roy: Could you update on the distribution expansion there? Has the competitive intensity gone up because the competition seems to have done slightly better and you said versus expectation is a bit lower in Ess Ess?

Management: I do not think there is any real difference.

Abneesh Roy: Rural acceleration, any data point you can share -- has the rural grown faster than Q2 on YoY basis taking all those?

Management: Prior to Diwali rural always grows faster; Diwali was later in November, rural growth has been good.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Avi Mehta from IIFL. Please go ahead.

Avi Mehta: Sir, I was just referring to your comment towards the end about demand environment remains uncertain. This despite very good quarterly performance that you have seen. Would it suggest that there are more one-off factors like festive season timing, price increase announcements, Kerala flood, etc., which have driven this improvement in this quarter because I am just trying to understand why those two contrasting data points -- one is your data point and one is your commentary, just if you could explain that please?

Management: There is definitively a factor of a delayed Diwali helping this quarter. We are little uncertain about the future quarters because of elections and other things, uncertain raw material prices, rupee volatility, etc., all these play a role in overall demand situation.

Avi Mehta: So, would this be a more medium termish kind of commentary that you are trying to indicate or elections would happen okay, so you are saying that is the reason why you are not willing to call it out despite strong growth?

Management: Yes.

Avi Mehta: Sir, the second bit was if you could help clarify how was the growth across different categories; Distempers growth versus, has there been any divergence in the growth rates that you have seen specifically?

Management: I think growth has been good across all categories in this quarter.

Avi Mehta: So, there is no salience of distempers rising the way you had called out in the last quarter right sir?

Management: Compared to previous year, yes, compared to the last quarter, no.

Avi Mehta: Okay, but sir is that previous year because of the festive timing only you think or is there an underlying shift what I am trying to get is do you feel there is a shift on market shares on the back of GST rate reduction or would you be willing to call that out or no?

Management: Give me another year and I will tell you.

Avi Mehta: Sir lastly, there was the other comment about despite the two rounds of price increases we are able to recover gross margins to an extent. Does that imply that in the current level of input cost, does need another round of price increase is that what you mean or what exactly?

Management: When we did the price increases, we did not do what we really wanted to do to the full extent. Since the raw material prices have fallen a little bit, the rupee has strengthened a little bit. So, the situation is volatile and uncertain. It is quite fluid. We really need to see how it goes in the months coming by.

Avi Mehta: So, comment to an extent is more because of the uncertainty of raw materials rather than the current level of raw materials right sir?

Management: At the point we did price increases we should have done a higher price increase. We decided not to do so because we were uncertain on how the raw material prices are going to vary. Fortunately, they dipped a little bit, that helped us. If they rise again, we would probably have to do a price increase.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Aditya Soman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Aditya Soman: Has there some meaningful contribution from your new products such as Waterproofing, so we have seen the number of SKUs that go up meaningfully in the last year?

Management: Yes, but it is probably not that significant in the overall value of business.

Aditya Soman: With these new products, is this also generating higher volumes for your Decorative business or it is a big competitive edge in a sense it is not very meaningful from revenue perspective?

Management: We expected to become meaningful from a revenue perspective and yes, it definitively lends an edge to our overall paint business.

Aditya Soman: Secondly, in terms of depreciation this quarter we saw significant increase. Is this just a function of the commissioning of the Mysuru plant and should we expect that to be even higher in 4Q given that Vizag will also come on board?

Management: Absolutely right.

Aditya Soman: So, a number little bit higher than what we saw this quarter would be fair to assume for Q1 and thereafter?

Management: Yes.

Aditya Soman: And for next year, we are done with the Capex right now largely in terms of the big hump of CAPEX, so Rs 800 crores on this plant and Rs 1,000 crores overall. So, should we expect a lower level for next year or…?

Management: Much lower number.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Arnab Mitra from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Arnab Mitra: I just had one question that despite very high revenue growth, there does not seem to be any major operating leverage that has played out on staff and other expenses. So, what is the reason for that sharp step up and would you expect leverage to play out if growth rates remain reasonably high?

Management: No, staff cost in this quarter you see a slight increase because of our new plant which has come up, that cost of employees included in this quarter. As far as the retiral benefits are concerned, you see the increase because of the falling yield on the gratuity and leave liability. As far as operating leverage is concerned in this quarter, you cannot compare this quarter with the previous quarter because this quarter definitely growth in top line has contributed for some increase in variable cost. The percentage to sales if you look at it, it is still lower than the previous quarter.

Arnab Mitra: So, partially to do with the new factory cost basically?

Management: Yes.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vicky Punjabi from JM Financial. Please go ahead.

Richard: Hi, this is Richard here. I have got two questions: One is has this price cut due to the GST rate cut, anyway helped in lifting your demand condition and your volume growth. In a sort of higher price activity like painting know did something like 10% price cut actually helped lift demand significantly considering the labor cost would not have fallen?

Management: Let us put it this way; definitively helped to the extent that when we increase prices, the burden on people did not increase, and may be it helped to some extent with the unorganized sector in balancing out the price differences.

Richard: Would you attribute that to be a key reason for this high double-digit volume growth because I do not remember seeing such a positive description of volume growth from you in recent times?

Management: Give me another year like I said, I would not like to jump the gun based on one quarter.

Richard: My second question is on margin. If I ex out this the beating impact that you had in Q2 because you wanted to avoid stickering new prices, etc., the gross margin compression in Q2 was probably 80 bps or so as per my workings even though the reported number showed 140 bps compression. Now versus that 80 - 90 bps whatever that may be, the gross margin compression that we saw this quarter is about 120 bps and you took two rounds of price increases in Q3. I am just wondering why you did not take the two opportunities of the two price increase to fully correct the gross margin pressure that you faced and Q3 margin compression actually turned out to be sharper than Q2?

Management: So, you have to understand there is always a little bit of lag when we purchase raw materials since the fair quantity is also imported and dependent on crude and crude derivative, so there is always a lag between international prices and actual consumption average as we call it, that is one aspect. Two, we were reasonably clear given the slowdown that everybody talked of in China, etc., that the raw material prices are going to be volatile for some time to be, and we would be in a very vulnerable position if we took the entire price rise that we required. We have always tended to pump for growth over absolute profitability quarter-to-quarter.

Richard: Are you as optimistic about growth post Q3 or you think that was just a period of very good activity that happened?

Management: So, if there were no elections due around in the first quarter of next financial year, I would say YES; but elections are always a factor of uncertainly, let us see what happens.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Manoj Menon from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead.

Manoj Menon: Sir just a couple of questions actually: The first actually on the Sleek business. If you can give just some comments about Sleek it would be very helpful. Is it for about a per cent of revenue, 2% of revenue, how it is growing, what is the business plan there?

Management: It is about 1.5% of revenue.

Manoj Menon: What stage of evolution it is in that you have completely understood the business, one-offs are over, it is ready for an expansion, some color on what is the thoughts on that market per se?

Management: This year we have been growing consistently well. So, I would say we understood the business better than we did in the previous year, but it has also been offset by relatively slowdown in a construction boom and lot of the kitchen business also goes to fresh construction. So, it is a combination of things. I think we should be able to grow in both the Home Improvement business consistently for the next few years.

Manoj Menon: Then the second question is the overall Decorative business or may be very specifically on the Paints business. Would it be fair to say that the top players outperforming materially in the bottom end of the market versus the unorganized peers?

Management: Let us see how all the top players do. There is a little bit of that, but it is very difficult to judge because the unorganized sector is not very easily measurable.

Manoj Menon: On the third one, if I look at the capacity expansion plan that you have which is quite steep actually. So, would it be fair to say that the next three-year outlook that the management has is materially different than let us say what it was for the last three years of actual performance?

Management: The whole process of setting up a plant, getting approval and constructing it is; f you start from acquisition of land is actually a three to five year process. So, when we plan for expansion, we look at a little longer-term; yes, to safeguard our bets, we generally do not construct the entire plant at one shot, but we still like to try it and make it an economic size so that we will get the full benefits of efficiency and automation from the factory. As a result, we set these factories for I would say five to seven year time frame on how we are going to expand and this was done almost four or five years back so to speak. So, I do not think we will take year-to-year phenomena in terms of determining our capacity expansion.

Manoj Menon: No, the only reason I ask this because it is almost like half a million KL capacity coming up which is quite. I understood the timing factor, but just the question actually came how the genesis was more to do with the absolute numbers being very high in terms of the percentage increase on your current capacity?

Management: I agree.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Harit Kapoor from IDFC Securities. Please go ahead.

Harit Kapoor: I have two questions: First is on the subsidiary part. So, if we look at the subsidiaries which include the international business and PPG-AP the margins in the subsidiary business over the last two to three quarters have been stable at about 7.5-8% If you could just give some outlook on how the international cost structure and margins are panning out and have they kind of bottomed out in the first nine months of the year?

Management: In most of the international markets we are not really the market leader. And in an inflationary scenario, especially where currencies are depreciating and raw material prices increasing, if you are a market laggard or of a much smaller market share, it is extremely difficult to pass on the entire raw material price increases to consumers and that has adversely affected us. Simultaneously, two markets; one, Ethiopia we have we had a severe foreign exchange crisis where frankly selling the material is not a problem, but getting the raw material is the severe problem because you do not have foreign exchange, and Egypt where the economy has stuttered a little bit and that has continued for some time. Whether it is bottomed out or not, it is not very easy to say.

Harit Kapoor: Is there any incremental pressure you have seen in any of these markets in the last one or two quarters or so that makes you believe that there is still uncertainty there?

Management: I do not think there is any incremental pressure per se or more competition or any other factors. Only the incremental pressure that came in the beginning of Q3 was the raw material inflation that spiked up.

Harit Kapoor: On the PPG-AP part which kind of reflect in your associate profit, there has been a fairly good jump up from Q2 to Q3. So, would that be a reflection of certain price pass-through that you have been able to get where the profitability has improved in that business?

Management: A little bit, but the auto OEM sector the pass-throughs are much more difficult, there is a big lag between negotiating prices with the big auto players, not all of them are doing too well and are reluctant for price increases at this point of time. So, that takes a little bit of time. The other businesses have been able to recover some element of the raw material price increases.

Harit Kapoor: Last question is on the capacity expansion. Any tax benefits on this and in which line item are we to see this whether it is in the form of refund or it will be just in the form of lower tax rate on either Mysuru or Vizag if you could just help us with that?

Management: Mysuru, there is industry loan benefit, but we are yet to get the entire process and documentation executed with the government. So, it may not impact the financials per se, it will come as a balance sheet item. As far as the Vizag is concerned, yes, we have a tax benefit similar to what we have in Maharashtra, but that will accrue when we start hitting the market may be later part of the year or next year.

Harit Kapoor: Okay, it is a similar kind of thing; zero percent for first five years and stuff like that?

Management: No, it is a refund subsidy; whatever the tax you collect, then government pays it to you later.

Harit Kapoor: Which would be reflected in our other operating income.

Management: Yes.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pulkit Singhal from Motilal Oswal Asset Management. Please go ahead.

Pulkit Singhal: My question is nothing to do with the quarter but I was just looking at your revenue growth for the last 10-12 years in the standalone business. Now we had a phase of around six to seven years of 20-25% kind of growth rates till FY’12, in the last six years till FY’18 it has been in the 10- 15% kind of growth rate range. I just wanted to understand, what in your view were the reasons for the, there is a clear step down in terms of the growth rate by 10%-odd from those high levels?

Management: A) I do not think it was exactly 10%, may be 7-8% but you are not far off. There were two essential reasons: The first was in the earlier period you are in a high inflationary scenario, prices were increasing by 3-5% every year. While most of the period you are talking of the last five periods except for this year primarily, has been a deflationary period where prices have actually dropped in the middle. The second is the GDP growth was definitely seen to be higher with the much higher growing middle class in India in that decade and higher GDP growth or higher number of earning people where households and good construction business definitely has spurred growth to a greater extent.

Pulkit Singhal: Is there an element also of new real estate construction, we know that real estate scenario has not been particularly great for the last five to six years, does that sentiment impact repainting cycles as well?

Management: It does not impact repainting cycles, but it definitively impacts the quantum of repainting feasible. If we have less houses, less of them are going to be repainted, in the sense you had a growth because the construction was heavy in the decade and you had a lot of houses that are repainted, lot of the fresh houses actually go for rentals and the great thing about rentals is houses get painted every three years.

Pulkit Singhal: Just another question is on the pricing strategy. Given that in this new phase of growth, 10-15% versus the 20-25%, I believe we were probably more of volume growth driven focus back then. Is it based now on volume, gross margin or EBITDA margin targets, how do you look at how much to take price hike because now we see more of premiumization happening in the last five, six years?

Management: I think premiumization was happening even then to a big extent. So, I do not think there is any real difference on that end. If anything in the last five years, there has been more sale of lower value products like puttys and this year distempers, which has had an impact at a lower end.

Pulkit Singhal: The question was how do you decide on how much pricing hike to take – is there a margin target on gross level, EBITDA level or how do you…?

Management: Something at EBITDA level, gross level and net profit.. distributors, shareholders, all that.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rahul Maheshwari from TCG AMC. Please go ahead.

Rahul Maheshwari: Two questions: One, the new factor which would be adding the capacity, so currently before the factory even have not started, what was the outsourcing percentage which you used to give to the third-party contract in-house, what was the percentage and now once the new factory has come into play, how much the percentage of outsource contracting would be reduced and that how it will be impact on the financials that in terms of the margins, how the cost savings or the margin accretion would be taking place? Second, what is your current distribution number of dealers which is taking place and as compared to the percentage increase which you are planning out on a yearly basis, I am not talking of quarterly, would it be in line with the industry growth rate not in terms of their absolute amount but as compared to industry what the distribution dealers are growing for your company?

Management: Between 25-30% of my volume is outsourced, but these tend to be lower value products where we look for a freight advantage in terms of sourcing all over the country. Actually the products we make in our factory are a little different from the products we outsource. So, the percentage outsourcing may not change significantly if the growth rates of both the categories are similar. So, hence it will not directly affect cost. Yes, the factory in South India will increase cost because you have very additional plant operating but it will decrease cost because of the freight the South India demand will reduce. The second question was, we add roughly around 3000 dealers a year. We have about 60,000-65,000 dealers. I have no idea about the competition numbers. So, I would rather not comment on that.

Rahul Maheshwari: Sir, when you said the new factory which is building, purely towards the water based solvents which is the high margin product. So, what kind of differential between your base value segment is there and that definitely it will take time to increase the capacity in that new factory. Any quantum or color or idea on what the pricing differential in terms of number of x times, can you?

Management: We are a raw material intensive industry and actual manufacturing cost is a very small element of our selling price. Actually, the difference in freight cost, etc., will probably be more substantial than the difference in manufacturing cost.

Rahul Maheshwari: Any range what freight cost savings would be taking?

Management: Sorry, We would not like to give that at this point of time.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Abneesh Roy from Edelweiss. Please go ahead.

Abneesh Roy: A few follow up questions: One is Indonesia we saw in Q2 also nature cause of worry, floods, etc., Q3 also some bit. So, could you update on the demand side? And Emulsion launch what is the update and distribution expansion how much has been done in Q3?

Management: We are still such a small player that we are not really hit by the calamities, etc., that occur to some extent but in some of these places where the islands in this world of global warming, we can expect this to happen any time. The growth has been good and we have expanded the network. If I go roughly by the key emulsion selling edge we have, we had about 175 color infinity as we call them in Indonesia, we have added a little more than 100 this year and expanded the network across many islands. We have added three more distributors this year and increase the network they are catering to. But yet we are very small.

Abneesh Roy: To understand the total universe what is the rate of expansion both distributors and color thing which you said?

Management: It is not entirely comparable because every company is adopting a different policy. There are two large companies that operate directly through their own distribution centers and through the dealer network, that is Avia Avian and Nippon and two that operate through distributors -- Mobilac and Akzo. So, you have to remember, we are also new, we are understanding the market to a great extent and there are 1,000 islands there, it is a highly dispersed market. I do not think I am in a position to give you very accurate data on this.

Abneesh Roy: But it continues to meet the internal target, right?

Management: Yes.

Abneesh Roy: Tamil Nadu market share, has it come back for you, any comment on Nippon because I am seeing them again becoming very aggressive on the media spend?

Management: Yes, they are, but I think we have held our own this year.

Abneesh Roy: Sir, when I see the pricing, you have taken four rounds of price hikes in the calendar year, the last one in December, so total hike of around 7-8%. So, in the premium end and lower end, will the hike be similar – 7-8% or fair to expect that at the higher end it will be more and lower end will be subsidized?

Management: It will be similar, it would not be grossly different; but there could be marginal differences here and there. I do not think we take rarest policy that premium has to get more premuimized, we try and maintain a certain minimum gross margin across categories and we are trying to maintain that.

Abneesh Roy: We have seen discretionary slowdown definitely in a lot of the categories. So, my question is in the metro cities, has the growth tapered down now, again do not see Q3 because Q3 is abnormal quarter because of one or two reasons, but are you seeing pockets of slowdown in Mumbai, Delhi, some of the bigger markets?

Management: Not really.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pratim Roy from Stewart & Mackertich. Please go ahead.

Pratim Roy: I have already two to three questions. First of all, how much volume is coming from the real estate segment top line? What is the view, is there any significant demand picking up because after GST and RERA there is a lot of issue in real estate segment, so if you can give me some idea, what is the contribution – has it gone up from a real estate segment demand?

Management: I would say our market share in the real estate segment is little lower than the normal painting segment. So, it has been consistently growing up every year and I would say it has gone up although I think the real estate segment has not done that well. I do not think GST has had that much of an impact on the real estate segment.

Pratim Roy: Demon effect also there, right, that impacted the real estate segment in a large way. But my question is that is the real estate demand going up, there is an opportunity, so that the paint demand is also going up, I just want to match these things?

Management: I think the real estate segment would be maybe about 20-25% of the paint demand and repainting could be about 75% of the real demand. The fact of real estate going up or down does not that grossly affect the overall paint demand.

Pratim Roy: The recent capital expansion, what is the capacity utilization that you are expecting in the next two to three years?

Management: Capacity utilization will be entirely on how much we can sell. So, I can come back to you once we firm up our plans.

Pratim Roy: The volume growth, if you can give me the exact number on year-on-year basis, sequential quarter, quarter-on-quarter last year same quarter?

Management: Sorry, We do not give exact numbers on volume growth. We will give you exact value growth.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pratik Poddar from Narnolia Financial. Please go ahead.

Pratik Poddar: What is the current capacity utilization that you are working on?

Management: Around 80%.

Pratik Poddar: As in the last question, you said that you do not give exact volume figure, but if you could just help us with if it was in high teens or in the low 20s?

Management: I said high double- digit volume growth.

Pratik Poddar: The other way around, I just wanted to actually understand in Q2 we faced lower realization due to rebates given because of the stickering cost, just wanted to clarify is that reversed in this quarter?

Management: It was not just the stickering cost, it was the fact that we did not want to appear to take benefit of the GST reduction by not passing on the full benefit to the consumers. So, as a result, in spite of steep rise in raw material prices, we took a conscious decision not to increase prices by about two months. There was a very sharp increase in raw material prices and we did not increase prices for more than two months and hence we suffered.

Pratik Poddar: Agreed sir. Sir, what I intended to ask is actually apart from the price hike that we have taken, is there any reversal of better realization that we have found already in the products which we have lesser of distemper share and that is how the realization was much higher than the price hike we have taken?

Management: As a matter of fact, when we took the price hike, we were not able to recover the entire impact of the raw material cost increases. Fortunately, after that raw material prices have fallen a little bit and we are in a little more comfortable position. Otherwise, we probably would have had another price hike by now.

Pratik Poddar: Over the last four quarters, we are facing a lot of margin pressure in the international business. So, do you think the situation will improve going ahead in the next year not in the Q4 immediately?

Management: It should because we tend to face margin pressure in the international business as well as an industrial JVs because in most of these businesses, we are not the dominant market leaders and whenever there is a sharp inflationary pressure we are not immediately able to pass on the raw material price hikes to consumers, there is always a lag. And in period where inflation continues over a period of time, you have a price increase, but there is a further inflation you are playing a catch up game for some time. Secondly, some of the markets, Egypt and Ethiopia over the last couple of years have definitely had high extent of inflation, foreign exchange crisis, currency, all, etc., which has compounded the problem.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Akshat Chandak from FMP Global. Please go ahead.

Akshat Chandak: Just wanted to understand your mix regarding the water-based and solvent-based products? So, are we at 50:50 or are we getting better off that mark since you had earlier highlighted that the water based is growing at much higher pace, want your comments on that?

Management: Water-based is much more than 50.

Akshat Chandak: How is the traction that you are seeing in the home improvement business, is the traction present or you are actually making losses there, right?

Management: We are making losses at the moment, but that losses are essentially because of the expansion of the distribution system and set up. We are seeing good growth. So, in a few years, we should become profitable.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Abhijeet Kundu from Antique Stock Broking. Please go ahead.

Abhijeet Kundu: My first question was you said that for FY’19 YTD we have seen higher sales of distemper. So, for this quarter also the same would apply that there was inferior product mix as compared to the previous year quarter?

Management: Compared to the previous year quarter, yes.

Abhijeet Kundu: So, the actual realization growth would be lower than the price hikes that you have taken?

Management: On a portfolio level, yes.

Abhijeet Kundu: Sir, you have been increasing your distribution in newer geographies. How much of your growth would be coming from this new distribution expansion? On a consistent basis even if we see 11-12% is the volume growth. So, how much of it would be driven by your new distribution initiative? I do not want to be quantified but …

Management: It is very small. We have 60,000 outlets and we have opened 3,000 that is 5% and these tend to be smaller because they are fresher, the impact is very insignificant in the short-term; in the longer-term this multiplies and becomes fairly significant as the years go by.

Abhijeet Kundu: Sorry, I should have put it in this way that how much of this would have been contributed by the distribution that you would have done for the last three, four years because as you rightly said that contribution improves and becomes sizeable over a period of time?

Management: Frankly, I will have to calculate, I cannot give you a rough answer, but if you are increasing 5% networth over the last three, four years, probably it might have 5% impact at the overall level.

Abhijeet Kundu: Sir, we have seen close to 20% increase in staff cost and about 25% increase in other expenditure, majority of that would be primarily due to your new capacity addition during the quarter. Now, post Q4, when the other capacity also comes in, on overall basis we should see higher increase in your staff cost as well as in your other expenditure, right?

Management: You are right, it was partially due to the commissioning of the Mysuru plant but probably higher factor was the drop in interest cost of gratuity and unpaid leave. So, there are number of variables that come into employee cost. It is a combination of both the factors, but you are right, when the next plant comes, that plant employees will also come into manpower cost.

Abhijeet Kundu: So, primarily why I am asking that is your other expenditure has gone up by close to 25%?

Management: I think quarter-to-quarter is not a right way to look at other expenditure because you will always have say for example this quarter we had higher marketing spend because of the specific ad that we ran this quarter. So, maybe at YTD level is the right sense to get around the overheads.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Abhishek Bhandari from Macquarie. Please go ahead.

Abhishek Bhandari: I have two questions: First is I remember in one of the calls earlier you had said that you do not want to cross a certain threshold margin as it might attract too much of competition. So, do you think if I look at the trailing nine months margin at 20.7%-odd, I do not know the number, but do you think are we around that number, there is still some more scope before we can hit that threshold?

Management: I really cannot answer that question because the raw material pricing is so volatile at the moment. It changes month-to-month at the moment what is my margin and I do not like changing prices every month. So, I take a little bit of gamble and try and look at the next quarter before I decide on pricing.

Abhishek Bhandari: My second question is around your huge capacities which are coming up both in Mysuru and Vizag this quarter. You might have some internal plans to sweat out your assets with certain threshold utilization. So, beyond the usual ramp up in our steady fashion are there any incremental distribution plans or extra marketing efforts you are trying to do especially for South India where these capacities are coming up?

Management: I wish it was so easy to sell more just by putting up capacity. We are on a competitive scenario where all our competitors are also putting up capacity. But you got to take it while these plants look huge, the current capacity we are putting up probably will be fulfilled in the next four years or five years. Given the timeframe we have to set up plants and the difficulty we get in setting plants, we are comfortable with this.

Abhishek Bhandari: The reason for asking this, do you think the initial cost of employees and the other expenses will be covered by the sales plan what you have internally for those at least for next one year?

Management: If you include depreciation then it is little difficult, I agree.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rahul Maheshwari from TCG AMC. Please go ahead.

Rahul Maheshwari: Just wanted, what is the progress on AP Homes and how well it has been trended during the quarter and what is your plan going forward for AP Homes because you had planned that once it starts progressing, you would be opening other branches too?

Management: The four we have are operating fairly effectively as well, selling paints and other categories quite consistently. We are planning to open up four more by the middle of say July next year.

Rahul Maheshwari: What percentage it would be contributing?

Management: Very small yet.

Rahul Maheshwari: Second thing, I know it would be difficult because you have current capacity at 1.1 million KL and you have added 0.6 million KL which is 58% of the current entire peers. So, just wanted, what kind of demand is on the overall outlook would be there or whether there is sufficient demand whether one would be grabbing the market share from the other peers and the next phase would be coming more 0.6 KL, and you have told just now that your entire full capacity would be taking this in four years. So, how big is the market so that the entire industry can grow because quite capacity as a percentage is almost combining all the peers, it is very high sir.

Management: I agree, we are reasonably optimistic about the future.

Rahul Maheshwari: But the same kind of trend can be maintained sir, do you think you would be gaining the market share from others by being more aggressive right now from what you were facing from last two years?

Management: Let me put it this way. If you do not have the capacity, you definitely cannot gain market share. If you have the capacity, you have potential to gain market share.

Rahul Maheshwari: But sir, just to squeeze a little bit, once you are now with the capacity ready and demand is there and if to gain the market share would you play on a volume front more little bit compromising on margins or you would intact the margins in the place even though the capacity does not ramp up in the way what you want?

Management: Sorry, We will not be able to answer that.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pulkit Singhal from Motilal Oswal Asset Management. Please go ahead.

Pulkit Singhal: The last five to six years that you mentioned was a deflationary cycle. To that extent, obviously the labour cost has gone up and that probably firms a larger chunk of the overall painting cost at this point, maybe around 60%-odd. To that extent, do you think your ability to take price hikes is lot better than it was say six years back and therefore to manage the raw material price volatility because the overall paint cost to the consumer will not change as much as it would have earlier?

Management: Yes, you are right, absolutely, but there is also a channel in between and for example Mumbai the painting contractor determines the rate that is being charged, etc., with the consumer. To them, the actual price makes a significant difference. For the small household, you are absolutely right, it is much easier to pass on but in larger projects that the painting contractors is much more difficult to pass on price hikes.

Pulkit Singhal: Sir, what would be your sense in terms of the price inflation over the last five, six years like a combination of these two, how much would a consumer be facing, overall the painting for the same like-to-like?

Management: GST reduction has definitely helped the consumer because it is reduced by about 10% but still about 10-15% increase in painting cost would be there for the household.

Pulkit Singhal: This Home Solutions business, I think you started at some point, labour cost, I mean, I do not know whether India would ever go to do-it-yourself kind of painting because you are so used to servicing. Do you think this Home Solutions business could be a big one for you even say 10-years down the line or is that an area we are getting into because you start competing with your own?

Management: We are never competing with our own shopkeepers because we were always sourcing the material through the shopkeepers, but the model is a higher cost model because when it is being done through company, you end up paying all the taxes, etc., So, we have launched a new model about two years ago which is doing exceptionally well which we call “Paint Total” which is through a dealer network. We train the painters and painting contractors and the supervisors to carry out a job very similar to the home solutions but at a much lower price. So, this model is doing very well as a matter of fact and we plan to propagate and extend this extensively all over the country. It is already operating in more than 150-cities and towns in the country.

Pulkit Singhal: That model is allowing you to keep a tab on the painting cost to the consumer in a better way?

Management: Yes.

Moderator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will take the last question from the line of Indira Badrinarayan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Indira Badrinarayan: Just one book-keeping question please. Any guidance on the overall tax rate for the next full two years?

Management: We are in the highest marginal rate. First, you will get some benefit but it is not very significant if you look at the overall tax what we pay to the government.

Moderator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I now hand the conference over to Mr. K.B.S. Anand -- M.D. and CEO, Asian Paints for closing comments.

K.B.S. Anand: Thank you, everyone for participating in our conference call. Thanks a lot and meet you next quarter.

Moderator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Asian Paints Limited, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines.",8334,0.24550447151774452

ICICI Direct's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints recorded a stupendous performance with topline growth of ~24% YoY led by ~21% YoY (I-direct estimate) growth in volume. Strong festive demand coupled with aggressive price hikes (~6% YoY in May-December 2018) helped drive the topline in Q3FY19. The volume growth was led by lower end product categories (higher distemper sales in Q3FY9) resulting in lower realisation growth. According to the management, the price hike was insufficient to offset the higher raw material prices. As a result, despite strong volume growth, the gross margin declined 127 bps YoY, impacting EBITDA margin. Further, commencement of new plant in Mysuru resulted in higher fixed cost leading to a spike in employee cost, other expenditure by 26%, 19% YoY, respectively We introduce FY21E estimates and model volume CAGR of ~14% in FY18-21E supported by a shorter repainting cycle and increasing presence in the southern region through two news facilities (with capacity of 3 lakhs/KL each) in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. We also believe the company would maintain EBITDA margin of ~19% led by fall in crude linked raw material prices.

Outlook

We expect APL to record revenue, earnings CAGR of ~17%, ~15%, respectively, in FY18-21E led by volume CAGR of 14% in the domestic segment. We believe pressure on gross margin (due to change in product mix coupled and higher raw material cost) will ease, going forward, supported by aggressive price hikes. We believe the strong volume witnessed during the quarter factoring in structural demand given the lower per capita paint consumption in India. We roll over our valuation on FY21E with a revised target price of Rs 1600/share. We change our stance on the stock from HOLD to BUY.

The December quarter earnings have not been blockbuster, but they have not been as bad as was earlier estimated. This has led to some tailwinds for Indian market even as global cues remain slightly muted.

For markets to sustain any breakout, earnings will play a big role, suggest experts. Although there are fears of a global slowdown, most experts feel India should outperform.

""Unless we head towards a global recession, a deceleration in global GDP growth would not necessarily cause a reversal in a market direction at home. On the contrary, India’s growth rate at over 7 percent would look even more attractive to investors, when compared to a slowing globe,"" Amar Ambani, President & Head of Research, YES Securities told Moneycontrol.

India will be marked as the world’s fastest-growing major economy while the global economy is forecast to slow, the International Monetary Fund said. India’s GDP is forecast to expand 7.5 percent in FY20 and 7.7 percent in FY21. China’s growth is seen at 6.2 percent in both years.

The global economy is projected to grow 3.5 percent in 2019 and 3.6 percent in 2020, 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points below last October’s projections.

“Cleary India is even outperforming today and given positive vibes led by structural reforms to perform in the long term. Earnings growth for FY20 will get better by H2FY20 led by positive lag-effect of reforms (like GST, IBC, NPA restructure), then the subdued growth of the last three years due to the disruptive effect of a bunch of reforms,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“India’s fiscal position is much better today, while a long-term negative view on oil prices will have a further impetus on the country’s macro situation. Food inflation has been brought under control by the government led by reforms and measures in the rural economy. This will lead to lower consumer inflation improving RBI’s stance from ‘calibrated tightening’ to ‘positive’, leading to an interest rate cut in the future.""

Here is a list of six stocks in which brokerage firms raised their 12-month target price post-December quarter results and can give 12-30 percent return:

Asian Paints: Upgraded to Outperform| Raised target to Rs 1,580| Upside: 12 percent

Macquarie upgraded Asian Paints to outperform rating post-December quarter results and also raised its 12-month target price to Rs 1,580 from Rs 1,180 earlier.

Volume growth has picked up significantly, and the volume growth outlook has also improved which is a positive sign.

The recent price increases with falling input costs will improve margins, said the Macquarie note. The global investment bank also raised FY19-21 EPS estimates by 7-16 percent. The full effect of lower GST rates yet to play out, added the note.

HDFC Bank: Buy| LTP: Rs 2,134| Target: Rs 2,530| Upside: 18 percent

Edelweiss marinated its buy rating on HDFC Bank post-December quarter results and raised its 12-month target price to Rs 2,530 from Rs 2,454 earlier.

The core operating performance remains strong, but the asset quality slipped a little bit. The GNPL rose to 1.38 percent, and slippages rose 2.1 percent in December quarter largely impacted by agri segment.

Due to challenges in the operating environment, Edelweiss expects a flight to safety in favour of private banks, it said in a note.

SBI Life Insurance: Buy| LTP: Rs 618| Target: Rs 760| Upside: 23 percent

Citigroup maintained its buy rating on SBI Life Insurance post-December quarter results but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 760 from Rs 700 earlier.

The company showcased a strong December show. It recorded strong protection growth. Improving productivity of bancassurance and agency channel should sustain growth, said the note. SBI Life made MTM provision for investment depreciation which could reverse.

L&T Infotech: Buy| LTP: Rs 1,781| Target: Rs 2,100| Return: 18 percent

Citigroup maintained its buy rating on L&T Infotech post December quarter results and raised its 12-month target to Rs 2,100 from Rs 2,045 earlier.

The company reported a strong December quarter, and it remains the top mid-cap pick for Citigroup. EBIT margin rose due to an increase in offshore mix and better utilisation.

Premium valuations are likely to sustain given strong visibility and good execution.

Zee Entertainment: Outperform| LTP: Rs 425| Target: 564| Upside: 32 percent

Macquarie maintained an outperform rating on ZEE Entertainment post December quarter results and raised its target price to Rs 564 from Rs 556 earlier.

The December quarter addressed investor concerns on margins and progress of ZEE5. The global investment bank strongly believes that Zee is among the most attractive media assets in emerging markets.

Apollo Hospitals: Buy| LTP: Rs 1,295| Target: Rs 1,600| Return: 23 percent

HSBC maintained its buy rating on Apollo Hospitals post December quarter results and also raised its 12-month target price to Rs 1,600 from Rs 1,275 earlier.

The global investment bank sees a better operating margin trend for its hospital's biz with improving profitability. New hospital momentum likely helped 3QFY19. The outlook remained intact on improving mix and operating leverage.

We have collated a list of recommendations from global brokerage firms for Wednesday, January 23.

Asian Paints: Upgraded to Outperform | Raised target to Rs 1580

Macquarie upgraded Asian Paints to outperform rating post December quarter results and also raised its 12-month target price to Rs 1,580 from Rs 1,180 earlier.

Volume growth has picked up significantly and the volume growth outlook has also improved, which is a positive sign.

The recent price hikes with falling input costs will improve margins, said the Macquarie note. The global investment bank also raised FY19-21 EPS estimates by 7-16 percent. The full effect of lower GST rates yet to play out, added the note.

TVS Motor Company: Sell| Target: Rs 360

CLSA maintained its sell rating on TVS Motor Company post-December quarter results with a target price of Rs 360. The company displayed good growth in December quarter but was largely in line with estimates.

Two-wheeler demand remains a big concern. TVS growth numbers were better in scooter/premium-bikes while on the other hand mopeds was a drag. Margin expansion unlikely amidst regulatory cost push and high competition, the note added.

Havells India: Outperform| Hike target to Rs 775

CLSA maintained its outperform rating on Havells India post Q3 results but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 775 from Rs 720 earlier.

The revenue growth surprises were visible across categories. The input costs impact consumer durables and Lloyd’s margins. Large channel inventory in the AC industry remains a concern, said the report.

Shree Cement: Outperform| Target: Rs 19050

Macquarie maintained its outperform rating on Shree Cement post Q3 results with a target price of Rs 19,050. Strong volumes have offset cost headwinds.

Cost deflation is likely to benefit from March Quarter, while price hike can drive upgrades. The capacity growth is likely to drive market-share gain in the next two financial years.

HDFC Life: Buy| Cut target to Rs 475

CLSA maintained its buy rating on HDFC Life but slashed its 12-month target price to Rs 475 from Rs 510 earlier.

The company recorded steady premium growth but with weaker persistency and margins. Steady credit protects business aids growth and profitability. Lower growth and margin forecasts are likely to drive 4-9 percent cuts to VNB forecasts for FY20-21.

Sun Pharma: Buy| Target: Rs 560

CLSA marinated its buy rating on Sun Pharma with a target price of Rs 560. Steps taken by the company to address governance issues is largely positive.

The outcome of whistle-blower complaint to SEBI will remain an overhang along with the outcome of DoJ investigation on price increases in the US. Valuation is fairly attractive given improving business fundamentals.

Asian Paints shares climbed 1.66 percent in opening but immediately fell nearly a percent, and further recovered to trade flat on Wednesday as brokerages feel strong Q3 earnings performance seems to be priced in but most of them maintained positive stance and some of them increased price target on hopes of good earnings ahead.

The stock was quoting at Rs 1,408, up Rs 1.45, or 0.10 percent on the BSE at 10:34 hours IST. It rallied 17 percent in last three months and 20 percent in last one year.

The paint maker reported a 14 percent on-year increase in third quarter profit at Rs 647 crore, driven by strong topline and operational growth. Consolidated revenue grew 24.3 percent to Rs 5,294 crore with double-digit volume growth in decorative business segment.

At operating level, consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) jumped 17 percent YoY to Rs 1,043.2 crore, but margin in Q3 contracted to 19.7 percent against 20.9 percent in same period last year on account of the higher raw material prices.

Here is the analysis of earnings by brokerage houses:

Deutsche Bank: Buy | Target: Rs 1,600 | Return: 14%

Company reported one of the strongest quarters in eight years. The research house expects the convergence of multiple tailwinds to drive the industry recovery and sees earnings CAGR of 21 percent over FY19-21.

CLSA: Outperform | Target: Rs 1,565 | Return: 11%

CLSA also said it was a blockbuster quarter for the paint maker with decorative paint volumes much better than its forecast.

It slightly tweaked earnings estimates & retained target price of Rs 1,565.

Jefferies: Buy | Target: Rs 1,620 | Return: 15%

Jefferies, too, said Q3 revenue/EBITDA growth came ahead of estimates while Q3 net profit was in-line with estimates.

Decorative volume growth of 23 percent YoY is robust & is a reflection of market share gain, said the research house which increased EPS estimates for FY20 & FY21 by over 6 percent to factor better margin.

Jefferies expects Asian Paints to sustain strong trajectory of volume growth. It has raised price target to Rs 1,620 from Rs 1,400 earlier.

Macquarie: Upgraded to Outperform | Target: Rs 1,580 | Return: 12%

Macquarie upgraded Asian Paints to outperform rating post December quarter results and also raised its 12-month target price to Rs 1,580 from Rs 1,180 earlier.

Volume growth has picked up significantly, and the volume growth outlook has also improved which is a positive sign.

The recent price increases with falling input costs will improve margins, said the Macquarie note. The global investment bank also raised FY19-21 EPS estimates by 7-16 percent. The full effect of lower GST rates yet to play out, added the note.

Citi: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,500 | Return: 7%

Citi also raised price target sharply to Rs 1,500 from Rs 1,255 earlier as it increased estimates by 4-6 percent accounting for stronger volumes and recent price hikes.

It sees 15 / 16 percent consolidated revenue/EPS CAGR over FY18-21 and believes medium-term upsides are well reflected in stock valuations. Hence, it has neutral call on the stock.

Sachin PalMoneycontrol Research

Asian Paints reported a strong set of numbers for the third quarter of the current fiscal year. The topline growth of 24 percent was aided by a combination of high double-digit volume growth in the domestic decorative business segment and recent price hikes.

The company reported fourth successive quarter of double digit volume growth on the back of strong consumer demand during the festive season.

Operating profits came in 14 percent higher and was aided driven by higher topline. Input costs pressures kept the operating margins under pressure on a yearly basis. However, recent price hikes along with softening crude prices led to margin improvement on a sequential basis.

While the domestic decorative business drove the overall topline, the industrial paints business witnessed good growth in both the protective coatings and powder coatings segment. The Automotive coatings and international business, however, reported a subdued quarterly performance due to host of factors.

The company has a dominant market share in the industry and has demonstrated its pricing power through successive price hikes in recent months. Going forward, we anticipate steady growth in earnings along with a recovery in margins in coming quarters.

Overall, Asian Paints (CMP: 1,396 and market cap: 1,33,866 crore) reported a strong set of earnings during the quarter and the stock trades at premium valuations which limits the upside from a near-term perspective.",238,0.6667558054129282

Asian Paints has reported a good growth in consolidated earnings for the quarter ended December 2018 with robust revenue and operational income, but margin performance was subdued due to higher raw material cost.

The bottomline increased by 14 percent year-on-year to Rs 647 crore, driven by strong topline and operational growth in Q3.

Consolidated revenue during the quarter grew by 24.3 percent to Rs 5,294 crore compared to year-ago with double digit volume growth in decorative business segment.

""The decorative business segment in India registered a high double digit volume growth and delivered strong performance across regions,"" KBS Anand, Managing Director & CEO, Asian Paints said.

He said the automotive coatings JV (PPG-AP), witnessed subdued growth in the auto OEM segment while the industrial coatings JV (AP-PPG) continued to witness good growth in the protective coatings – dealer segment and the powder segment.

At operating level, consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) jumped 17 percent YoY to Rs 1,043.2 crore, but margin in Q3 contracted to 19.7 percent against 20.9 percent in same period last year.

""Margins remained under pressure on account of the higher raw material prices,"" Anand said. Cost of materials consumed increased 24.4 percent YoY.

Numbers barring margin beat analyst' estimates. Profit was expected at Rs 624 crore and revenue at Rs 4,935 crore for the quarter, according to a CNBC-TV18 poll estimates.

Asian Paints is likely to post double-digit growth in volume as well as revenue, but weak operating margin may limit profitability despite price hikes and lower cost of raw material YoY.

Overall, brokerages expect the revenue to grow in the range of 12-17 percent year-on-year, driven by expected volume growth of around 12-13 percent for the quarter ended December 2018.

For the quarter, Edelweiss Securities said it expects Asian Paints to report around 12 percent YoY volume growth on a base of 6 percent (Q2FY19 saw 11 percent volume growth on a base of 8 percent) and sales to grow 13 percent YoY.

""The demand shift due to postponement in festive season should aid volumes coupled with a soft base. The total effective price hike of around 3.25 percent YoY should be seen for the quarter. Price hike taken in December will benefit from Q4FY19 onwards,"" it added.

The paint maker is likely to record sales growth of around 16 percent YoY to around Rs 4,931 crore in Q3FY19E led by volume growth (includes industrial paint) of around 12 percent YoY, according to ICICI Securities.

Crude prices are up 10.3 percent YoY but down 10.1 percent QoQ in Q3FY19. ""The magnitude of price movement in crude derivatives is lower vis-à-vis crude prices. But deflation has not yet begun in Q3FY19 either,"" said Motilal Oswal which expects revenue to grow 13 percent.

The price hike and fall in raw material prices could support operational growth QoQ but is likely to remain lower compared to year-ago due to use of high-cost inventory.

""As per analysis, after accounting for price hikes, domestic gross margin should improve 155bps QoQ during Q3FY19, however, it should contract 115bps YoY ,"" Antique Stock Broking said.

Asian Paints hiked product prices 2.35 percent in October and 1.5 percent in December 2018.

Edelweiss Securities also said prices of TiO2 and other monomers that are used as raw materials have declined from the peak. This coupled with price hikes and stabilising rupee should aid sequential gross margin recovery. ""Cost rationalisation will further boost margins on the EBITDA level when seen sequentially.""

According to ICICI Securities, EBITDA margin is likely to decline 180 bps YoY to around 19 percent while Motilal Oswal expects gross margin to contract 150bp YoY and operating margin to contract 290bp, with EBITDA declining 2.7 percent YoY in Q3FY19.

Hence, the year-on-year profitability is likely to be limited, though sequential growth is expected in Q3.

ICICI Securities said profit would grow marginally by around 5 percent YoY and 18 percent QoQ while Edelweiss Securities expects PAT to rise 6.9 percent YoY and 19.8 percent sequentially.

As the Nifty inches upwards in 2019, we could see a strong bounce back in many mid and smallcaps, but this revival would still be part of a major bottoming-out process for this space, Amar Ambani, President & Head of Research at YES Securities, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpt:

Q) The New Year started off on a muted note. What is your outlook on markets ahead of Budget or Vote on Account?

A) 2018 proved to be a year of severe disruption for the equity markets. The first setback was the introduction of the LTCG tax, which was followed by a litany of lethal blows, including MF scheme reclassification, ASM list announcement, Nirav Modi saga, NBFC liquidity crisis among others.

Thankfully, some of those concerns have now abated. Even better, crude oil now seems reasonably priced after Brent hit $85 at one time, sovereign yields have significantly softened following the IL&FS debacle, and the INR is relatively stable following the steep depreciation against the USD from 65 to 74 levels.

More importantly, the broader market fall has cleaned up frothy valuations from the secondary market. I sense a lot of stocks are in a bottoming-out phase.

Anticipating a sustained recovery in earnings of domestic-linked sectors (sans the public sector) and given the boost in the attractiveness of Nifty yield vis-à-vis fixed income yield, I find the current juncture to be a great time for loading up on stocks.

Q) What is your call on small & midcaps for 2019? How one should choose the right kind of stock for investment?

A) As the Nifty inches upwards in 2019, we could see a strong bounce back in many midcaps and small caps. However, this revival would still be part of a major bottoming-out process for this space.

This is an excellent time to accumulate interesting midcap and small cap stories, not exactly from a 2019 perspective but for a horizon of three years or more.

One should start identifying companies with credible management, those having sustained financial performance even during turbulent times.

Q) Given that Brent is trading around $55 to a barrel, what is your call on OMCs and aviation stocks?

A) We had a Sell call on OMCs last year, which was contra to the market which had placed them on the top picks list. Following the massive underperformance in last one year and with crude prices now having come off, it may appear that times could be ripe for OMCs again.

However, I view them as market performers at best. Given the hanging sword of elections, the sentiment is not great for PSU stocks. Refining margins have weakened in the recent past.

Large capex plans along with sustained dividend payouts will impact both cash flows and balance sheet strength. Restoring confidence levels would take significant time.

The aviation sector is a complete avoid given its fundamental woes. Average passenger air traffic has been soaring in high double digits for several years now, yet the airline industry is yet to register profits. Steer clear of this space.

Q) Any top five stocks or sectors which you are recommending to clients for a period of more than 1 year?

A) Some of our top picks for more than one-year horizon include Reliance Industries, KNR Construction, Axis Bank, Asian Paints, and Aarti Industries. We also believe the Capital Goods space will return to favour after a long lull.

Q) It looks like most of the worries are global in nature. Are we heading for growth slowdown in the US in 2019 or a possible recession?

A) A US growth slowdown does seem possible. Following the concerns over a slowing global macro backdrop, gloomy trade scenario and fragile financial markets, the US Fed itself has projected a lower growth of 2.5 percent and roughly 2 percent in 2019 and 2020 respectively.

This can be manifested by an inverting yield curve between 2-year and 1-year sovereign bonds and 5-year and 2-year as well. The longer end of the curve does not proportionally reflect the prospects of a persistent rise in interest rates, given 10-year yields retreating from 3.2 percent.

Q) If the globe is slowing down, do you think India will be able to pull it off with ease amid the possibility of a political drama which could unfold in the first half of 2019?

A) Unless we head towards a global recession, a deceleration in global GDP growth would not necessarily cause a reversal in a market direction at home.

On the contrary, India’s growth rate at 7%+ would look even more attractive to investors, when compared to a slowing globe. Any slowdown in the US economy could compel the Fed to pause or probably reverse the monetary tightening process.

Lower growth and soft sovereign yields in the US would facilitate the flow of capital to high-yielding emerging markets.

It's pertinent to note that election mandates do not have a lasting impact on equities, unless a third-front government assumes power at the center. We have seen bull and bear market cycles pervading across the UPA and NDA tenures.

Q) Retail investors have remained loyal to investing in equities via SIP route despite wild gyrations in 2018. Do you think the number could fall if the volatility increase?

A) Retail flows have been resilient in recent years, which truly speaks volumes of our domestic strength. These inflows have credibly helped fight volatility at times when FIIs were on a selling spree.

Technology has also played a vital role as many SIPs are on the auto debit mode from bank accounts. My sense is that retail flows will continue to flow into equities in a disciplined manner.

It would take over 10 percent downside from current market levels followed by a lackluster market for a prolonged period for the auto debit SIPs to be turned off. That seems highly unlikely.

Q) Enormous wealth has already been created in the history. The Sensex has grown like 100x in 32 years, at 15 percent CAGR. Do you think, 2019 will also give us a similar opportunity to enter and remain invested for a long time to create wealth?

A) I am very bullish on the market cycle for the next four to five years. For one, corporate earnings have remained largely subdued for a decade now.

A big take-off in earnings on this low base, when demand lifts industry utilization levels to 82 percent and above, will dramatically bring down market multiples. Secondly, India’s economy will more than double to $5 trillion in five years and I do not see any reason why the market indices would not follow suit.

Thirdly, a strong foundation of GST, Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar enrollments, Direct Benefit Transfer would progressively enable financial inclusion, arrest subsidy leakages and bring more enterprises in the formal economy.

The intent on infrastructure development is easily discernible. All these measures will help boost rural consumption, which is a prominent driver of our economy.

Q) What are your views on public sector banks after the recent RBI report suggested that the headwinds in terms of NPA mess could be abating?

A) Structurally speaking, I am negative on PSU banks. A work culture deprived of professionalism and fool-proof systems & processes, capital dependency on government and sub-optimal operating profitability are issues that would continue to haunt them for long.

Most PSU Banks would have to endure an arduous transformation journey before being worthy of attracting sustainable valuation multiples.

Having said that, there are times in any market cycle, when PSU Banks become tactical 'buy' ideas for a couple of years. FY20 onwards, their burden of delinquencies and provisioning stress should definitely recede.

In the wake of moderating asset quality pressure and a substantially improved treasury performance, their time may come anytime between now and next 15 months.

Amar Ambani

The market looks ripe for a major up move in 2019. The lower trajectory of crude price, low inflation regime, softening of sovereign yields, relatively stable currency after the mayhem in INR and partial recovery in the domestic earnings (ex-PSUs) are healthy signals for the market.

On the fiscal front, while revenue-expenditure trends haven’t been optimal so far, the government has reiterated its commitment to meeting the Budget target.

Correction in stock prices, especially in the midcap and small-cap space, in the last many months, has cleaned-up excesses from the secondary market.

While some global issues like trade war will be niggle on-and-off but may not dramatically escalate to impact markets. The fear of slowdown and President Trump’s anti-hike comments may hard-press the US Fed to pause the monetary tightening process.

Indian equity attractiveness is high, vis-à-vis fixed income, gold, and property. It’s possible to see the Nifty hit the 13,000 mark in 2019 itself.

Here is a list of top 5 stocks which could give 20-40% return in the next 1 year:

KNR Construction: Buy| Target: Rs 260| LTP: Rs 199| Upside: 30%

We are upbeat on infra spending in the year 2019. KNR has an order book that’s 3x its current revenues. Track record of timely completion of projects, HAM or hybrid annuity model order wins and P/E of 10x FY20 earnings. The one-year target for the stock is placed at Rs260.

Aarti Industries: Buy| LTP: Rs 1,431| Target: Rs 1,750| Upside 22%

Tailwinds in the chemical sector will continue given issues in China. Capacity de-bottling and visibility of revenue makes Aarti, a specialty chemical company, our favourite. The stock is trading at ~23x FY20 P/E and the valuations are fairly attractive. One-year target price Rs1,750.

Britannia Industries: Buy| LTP: Rs 3,122| Target: Rs 37,80| Upside 21%

Health volume growth, focus on premium product adoption by customers, expansion of capacities, increasing distribution reach and adding geographies overseas and moderate commodity price outlook will help Britannia grow 20 percent on a YoY basis. With valuation at 42x FY21E, our one-year target price is Rs3,780.

Asian Paints: Buy| LTP: Rs 1,356| Target: Rs 1,750| Return 29%

Continued dominance in the decorative segment, ongoing expansion to double capacity in a phased manner and traction in industrial and automotive coatings segments through joint ventures makes the company a safe and steady bluechip to be invested in.

We expect 19 percent CAGR in profits between FY18-22. The stock trades at P/E of 46x FY20 earnings. The one-year target price is placed at Rs1750.

Reliance Industries: Buy| LTP: Rs 1,090| Target: Rs 1,500| Return 37%

JIO’s industry beating performance in Telecom raises hope of similar performance in other digital ventures. We’re upbeat on improving fortunes of its retailing business and strong earnings growth in core businesses of refining and petchem on account of petcoke gasification and off-gas cracker. Trades at 15x FY20 earnings. One-year target price 1500.

The macro concerns for Indian equities got sidelines sue to forecast of easing global liquidity, crude oil softening and domestic currency (INR) gaining strength against USD. But in 2019, earnings downgrade will be the greatest risk as stock valuations are still above reasonable levels, Standard Chartered Securities (India) said in a note.

Nifty trades at a 12-month forward P/E of 17.2x, a 13 percent premium to its 10-year average of 15.2x. At current prices, investors are advised to invest in a staggered manner in stocks using every dip as an opportunity to add to equity exposure.

In terms of earnings, the combined net profit of 1,889 companies across the sectors in Q2 FY19 was up 16.2 percent, YoY, growing at the fastest pace in the last seven quarters, but was at the base of earnings, which de-grew 10.8 percent in the same quarter of the previous year.

The Nifty50 free float (FF) PAT growth was c.8 percent for Q2 FY19, resulting in H1 growth of c.6 percent compared to FY19 consensus expectations of a 19 percent. “This raises the hurdle rate for H2 FY19 considerably. Earnings downgrade remains the greatest risk for valuations of stocks still trading above reasonable levels, in our view,” said the note.

Standard Chartered handpicks stocks in its equity research report of ‘India Top Picks’ which provides a list of quality stocks with leadership positions in their business fields — a strong moat that helps generate above average return ratios than peers.

Maruti Suzuki (MSIL):

Standard Chartered Securities is positive on consumer discretionary spending increases, with higher growth coming from the rural sector. MSIL has been a market leader and has outperformed the industry historically.

Its market share increased to 50 percent in FY18 and further to 52 percent in H1 FY19 from 47 percent in FY17. However, management commentary suggests margins may remain muted in H2 FY19, primarily tracking the impact of the INR depreciation on input costs, which comes with a quarterly lag.

MSIL saw a rise in sales of 6 percent during the festive season this year against anticipated double-digit growth by the company. MSIL has seen 9.1 percent growth in domestic sales in April-October to 1.04m vehicles.

Metro markets are under pressure, along with concerns such as traffic congestion and the impact of shared mobility, as per the company. The global investment bank is positive on the new launches and MSIL’s ability to surpass the interim macro volatility in the long term. Electric vehicles could be the next big trigger for growth in MSIL.

Mahindra & Mahindra:

M&M is a pure play on rural growth via the tractors segment (38% of total volumes in H1). It is expected to grow within 11-13 percent in FY19, as per management’s revised guidelines. Management has indicated that rural sales contribute 51 percent of total sales.

Standard Chartered Securities are also positive on its auto division with the launch of its new product, Marazzo, which has a waiting period of 6-8 weeks despite MM scaling up to full capacity.

Its September results were broadly in line with consensus estimates, and the revised volume guidance by management is well priced in the stock valuations, in our view. The recent softening of commodity prices is an added positive.

The global investment bank also like the company’s aggressive growth strategy of launching new models in new segments (Jawa [premium two-wheeler segment], XUV700 [luxury SUV segment], Blazo [heavy duty truck segment] and Treo [three-wheeler electric segment]).

ITC:

ITC posted strong revenue growth in the July-September period, led by a recovery in consumer demand, especially in rural areas. In the second quarter, along with the hotels and agri businesses, FMCG-others posted double-digit revenue growth.

Revenue growth in Q2 was also led by staples, snacks, meals, and biscuits in packaged foods, fragrance, liquid hand wash and body wash in personal care, and notebooks in education and stationery.

Q2 cigarette volume growth was supported by a favourable base, along with the absence of price hikes and regulatory blows (no upward tax revision recently).

Going ahead, the next few quarters too should see growth in volumes at a healthy pace, aided by a favourable base effect (flat-to-negative volume growth in the previous three quarters).

The global investment bank is bullish on the FMCG-others non-cigarettes segment that management is increasingly counting on to de-risk its business model, given the reasonable valuations.

IndusInd Bank:

IndusInd Bank (IIB) is among the fastest-growing private sector banks (loan book grew 2.3x in the last three years to INR 1.6trn). It has been consistently delivering 25 percent growth in its loan book for the last 14 quarters, with deposits growing at a similar pace.

IIB has created a strong low-cost deposit franchisee with a CASA of 44 percent as on H1 FY19. Loan growth stood at 32 percent y/y in Q2 FY19, led by robust growth in the corporate segment. IIB expects demand for vehicle financing to remain healthy in the near-term.

Meanwhile, the closure of the BFI merger could strengthen its presence in micro-lending and benefit yields. Ongoing efforts to widen its branch network and leverage its digital capabilities may drive CASA growth and limit operating expenses.

HDFC Bank:

Many banks continue to face pressure on asset quality, liquidity constraints and lending restrictions. HDFCB has demonstrated growth on all fronts at a steady rate. The bank’s wholesale loan growth has outpaced other lenders by a wide margin.

HDFC Bank is leveraging its digital offerings, wide geographical reach, and suite of products to widen its reach to new and existing customers.

HDFC Bank could leverage the proceeds from its recently completed equity raise of c.INR 236bn to grow its market share in the high-yielding retail loan segment.

ICICI Bank:

Asset quality improvement is shown by ICICI Bank in the September quarter (Q2) has been viewed as positive by consensus. Provisions fell 11.3 percent on a YoY basis owing to lower slippage.

The gross and net non-performing asset (NPA) ratios improved 27bps QoQ and 54bps QoQ to 8.54 percent and 3.65 percent, respectively, in Q2 FY19. Regulatory efforts to stimulate funding of non-bank financial corporations (NBFCs) amid market liquidity constraints could provide

ICICIBC opportunities to lend at higher rates.

The liquidity crunch may also lead to ICICIBC capturing some loan demand from NBFCs. Meanwhile, its recent rate increase on the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate-linked loans may help cushion its net interest margin (NIM) in the near-term.

SBI Life Insurance Company:

Standard Chartered Securities have been upbeat on life insurance players on the background of high underpenetrated life insurance in India. Monthly data issued by the regulator also indicates that growth momentum for the business remains intact.

For many years, private sector insurers have been eating into the market share of public sector Life Insurance Corporation of India. Their market share went up 3.9ppt in October.

SBI Life continued its trend of healthy growth in individual annual premium equivalents (APE) of 17 percent in October 2018. SBI Life has an advantage due to its tie-up with SBI, which has a network of ~22,000 branches and is one of the largest agency networks, which adds to the distribution strength – a key basis for the global investment bank to add SBI Life to the India Top Picks list.

Larsen & Toubro:

L&T posted a 23 percent YoY jump in its consolidated net profit at Rs 22.30 bn in the September quarter (Q2 FY19). The company witnessed strong growth of 46 percent YoY, with order wins worth Rs 419 bn at the group level in Q2 FY19, due to a pick-up in domestic ordering activity.

Its order book stood at Rs 2.81tn, as of 30 September, of which the international order book constituted 22 percent. RoE expansion, through a combination of balance sheet de-leveraging, incremental operating margin gains and a focus on an asset-light pure play EPC model, should sustain valuations for L&T.

Cipla:

Cipla is expected to participate cautiously in global tenders to protect margins after reporting muted revenue growth in Q2. Despite US sales rising 23 percent, domestic operations' revenues remained flat.

The tender business (c.20% of consolidated sales) was under pressure on aggressive pricing and intense competition. Domestic business growth remained flat owing to a higher base of restocking created by the implementation of the GST last year. The firm has been filing aggressively to build a product portfolio in the US market in the past three years.

RIL:

All segments of the conglomerate RIL are doing well, and all segments of the business are doing well. The market is ascribing full value to its telecom venture Jio, while giving a fair valuation to its refining and petchem business, in our view. RIL's major investments are likely to deliver though improved margins and boosted cash flows.

At present, RIL is facing concerns with the scaling up of its ambitious petcoke gasification project. According to management, there have been technical challenges in the continuous synchronised operations of petcoke gasifiers.

The company hopes the problem will end by March next year. The project, once fully operational, is expected to add USD 2/bbl as GRMs for the company.

The recent correction in oil prices is likely to improve the outlook for the refining business. However, RIL’s integrated model helps it ride commodity uncertainties, which should continue.

Asian Paints:

Asian Paints Ltd is the largest paint company in India (50%+ market share in the domestic industry) and figures among the top 10 players in the world. Historically, the company has seen an increase in market capitalisation of 14x in the last 10 years and a rise in capacity of 5x to generate annual operating cash flow, which continues to add to shareholder wealth.

The global investment bank has added Asian Paints in the India Top Picks list at a time when the company is undergoing consolidation in its business operations and valuations have discounted the higher crude oil and raw material prices.

The company is also on the verge of completing its capex in South India, which would lead to logistical cost savings and incremental revenue growth.

Infosys:

The global cyclical recovery has caught our attention of the IT sector. We are noticing signs of recovery in key divisions of IT companies. Additionally, a surge in the number of total contract values (TCV) is expected to help the sector post better earnings going ahead.

In Q2 FY19, Infosys reported 4.2 percent constant currency growth q/q (the highest among the large peers). It has been facing a key leadership crisis for the past 2-3 years but is emerging out of an uncertain phase, with the new management, led by CEO and MD Salil Parekh, trying to catch up with market leaders using the new strategy set in place.

Infosys has maintained its guidance of 6-8 percent growth for the full year. EBIT margin guidance has also been maintained within 22-24 percent.

TCS:

After a gap of three years, TCS is expected to hit double-digit growth in FY19. The company stated it would end FY19 with double-digit growth, breaking the tradition of the last few years of not providing any guidance.

TCS also ticked all boxes on fundamental parameters – EBIT margins, deal wins, digital revenues, and attrition rate as well as client addition.

Led by strong growth in its two big verticals — banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), and retail — which account for 48 percent of revenues, TCS posted CC growth of c.3.7% in Q2 FY19 after posting CC growth of c.4.1% in Q1 FY19.

In recent news, a California jury cleared TCS of a class action lawsuit that claimed it discriminated against American professionals in favour of staffing its US offices with Indian professionals.

The market seems to be a bit cautious ahead of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)'s meeting on December 5. Experts believe the committee will likely keep the repo rate unchanged and refrain from tinkering with the cash reserve ratio (CRR).

Repo rate is the rate at which banks borrow short-term funds from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while CRR is the share of a bank's total deposits that it has to keep in a current account with the RBI.

Although the MPC meet is likely to be a non-event, experts feel future commentary on rates and measures taken by the central bank to infuse liquidity in banks and NBFCs will be important for the market.

""The RBI MPC in its meeting due on December 3-5 will likely keep the repo rate unchanged. The more interesting part will be deliberations on liquidity (overall and sectoral) though it will not be under the ambit of the MPC to address these issues completely,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note.

""The MPC will likely keep CRR unchanged and the RBI will continue to use OMO, FX spot intervention, and longer-tenure term repo to calibrate overall liquidity,"" the brokerage said.

The MPC, headed by RBI Governor Urjit Patel, had changed its policy stance to 'calibrated tightening' at its previous bi-monthly meeting, ruling out further rate cuts for the time being.

However, a jump in crude oil prices and the sharp depreciation of the rupee vis-à-vis the dollar led to expectations that the central bank could increase rates further.

Two months after the October 5 monetary policy, the rupee has returned to 69 to the dollar after touching a low of 74.22. Crude oil prices have declined 30 percent since then to $58 per barrel.

Also, inflation has cooled to a 13-month low of 3.31 percent, well below RBI's medium-term inflation target of 4 percent. October was the third consecutive month in which the headline inflation number came in lower than the central bank's targeted band.

“RBI, in its policy meet in December, is not expected to touch repo rate and a status quo can be expected,” Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICIdirect.com told Moneycontrol.

“The two most important variables after inflation are crude and currency which led to a rise in fiscal and economic worries have now corrected from their peaks which provides the breather. Therefore, unless core inflation sees a material upsurge, the upcoming monetary policy can be seen as a non-event,” he said.

Harshad Patil, Chief Investment Officer, Tata AIA Life Insurance, also expects the MPC to hold the repo rate at 6.50 percent on December 5 as the RBI awaits subsequent inflation prints.

Here are 10 rate sensitive stocks that you could consider buying ahead of the event:

Asian Paints

Asian Paints is India's leading paint company and ranked among the top ten decorative coatings companies in the world.

Being one of the market leaders offering its innovative products, it is better placed to capture incremental growth in the industry on the back of its strong distribution network, cost-efficient operations, better brand positioning amongst peers.

Operating margins are likely to improve in the longer term on commencement of the newer plants, lower logistics costs, and production of high-margin water-based paints.

Coromandel International

The company continues to invest towards infrastructure augmentation and capability development to offer a differentiated solution to the farming community.

Government’s ambitious plan to double the farm income by 2022 and fixing the minimum support prices for crops at 1.5 times the cost of production brings out a sizeable opportunity for the company.

Also, the increase in prices of higher-fertilizer-consuming crops such as paddy, soybean, and sugarcane augurs well for the company. We believe the company is well-positioned for holistic growth, led by increased volumes and higher realisations.

Trident

The company is fundamentally sound and during the September quarter, it has achieved good operating performance due to highest ever revenue growth.

According to the management of the company, it is optimistic to achieve the growth on revenue keeping its margins resilient in the coming quarters. Moreover, it plans to further consolidate the business by leveraging the existing customers and adding new customers to its portfolio.

Indian Hotels

Strong presence in the high-demand, high-occupancy micro markets of Mumbai, NCR, Bangalore, and Goa place it well to cater to rapid growth in the domestic market. Company’s performance improved in the first six months of the ongoing financial year despite uncertainties.

Indian Hotels is in the process of selling some of its non-profitable properties internationally. It sold the Boston property and leased it back. The amount was used to pare debt.

Indian Hotels’ debt has nearly halved in the last few quarters and the company plans to reduce it further by 30 percent in the next few quarters.

Bajaj Auto

The company has a diversified business model and a strong focus on profit growth, widening reach in export markets and strategic alliances with global majors.

The management said they would continue to focus on exports and new markets and has aimed exports of 2 million units in FY19, up from 1.6 million units in FY18. Management feels the product mix in exports is deteriorating due to a higher share of Africa which is currently at 45 percent and is expected to increase to 50 percent.

Nigeria contributes 50 percent of Africa's volumes. In the export market, motorcycle growth is mainly driven by the African market. On the other hand, 3-wheeler (3Ws) growth is driven by new markets (contributing 25 percent of sales) such as the Philippines, Latin America, Iran, and Iraq.

The company plans to increase annual capacity in 3Ws (including quadricycles) from 840,000 units to 1,000,000 units. FY19 capex is expected at Rs 300 crore and will be utilised towards debottlenecking, R&D, dies/tooling, etc.

SBI & ICICI Bank:

Current GDP growth at 7.1 percent suggests tapering of growth and hence RBI should adopt a rate cut/pause for a good period of time. In this scenario, banking stocks, particularly the corporate lenders should benefit.

Already, the corporate lenders are witnessing high advances growth both due to the shift of advances from liquidity stricken NBFCs to corporate lenders and also due to the revival of capex by the government as well as private sectors.

Already, advances for corporate lenders like SBI and ICICI Bank are witnessing high growth in the last two quarters.

SBI’s advances in the last quarter grew 9 percent while ICICI Bank advances grew 12.8 percent vis-a-vis -0.1 percent by SBI and 6.3 percent by ICICI Bank in Q2Fy18. Also, the growth in advances is coming from better-rated corporate which keeps the asset quality in control going forward.

Federal Bank:

The corporate advances for Federal Bank account for 40 percent of the total books, and 70 percent comes from AAA/ AA rated corporates. Fresh slippages are slowing down and are mainly from within the company’s watchlist.

With NPA provisioning requirements slowing down and Pre Provisioning profits growing at average 12 percent, corporate lenders are expected to report high-profit growth and hence high book value growth. This should also demand re-rating of corporate lenders which are trading at multi-year low valuations.

Escorts

We believe the long-term fundamentals of the tractor industry are solid. Though in the near term the pace of central and the state government’s policy may slow down due to elections and fiscal shortage.

But, we expect the status quo on the government's fiscal discipline in the long term and 25 percent earnings CAGR over FY18-20E, inducing confidence in the stock.

Brokerage Firm: Axis Direct

Godrej Agrovet

Axis Direct believes that Godrej Agrovet is well placed to scale up, given presence across under-penetrated and unorganised segments of the agri-value chain coupled with its strong brand, distribution, cash flows, and R&D focus.

The management guided for lower receivables by end of FY19 and targets debt reduction by ~Rs 200 crore (currently at ~Rs 400 crore). We expect the company to be debt-free in the next couple of years.

Volatile movements based on current political scenario involving elections, along with any downside on GDP growth are big headwinds for the market, Naveen Kulkarni, Head of Research at Reliance Securities told Moneycontrol’s Uttaresh Venkateshwaran. But that could be seen as an opportunity.

“Investors should be buying on dips stocks, which are backed by quality and earnings growth. This is a good time to build portfolio as higher volatility will mean lots of opportunities to accumulate quality stocks at discounted prices,” he told the portal. Edited excerpts:

What has your assessment of the current earnings season been? What are the big hits and misses?

The earnings season was by-and-large in line with the consensus expectation. Outlook on margins ahead is a little bleak. While there have been some cuts to the earnings estimates, it isn’t very significant. Nifty companies’ earnings for FY19 have been cut by 5% and for FY20 by 2% which isn’t very significant.

Some of the big hits in terms of outlook and quality of earnings have been for ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. Misses have been for Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints and Ultratech.

How should an investor approach the market from a one-year view?

One-year view of an investor should be to focus on value, backed by quality and earnings growth companies. The next six months will be volatile because the political temperature will climb.

State elections followed by general elections will keep the markets guessing. Thus, earnings visibility and valuations become very critical factors.

Investors should be buying on dips stocks which are backed by quality and earnings growth. This is a good time to build portfolio as higher volatility will mean lots of opportunities to accumulate quality stocks at discounted prices.

What are the key headwinds and tailwinds to watch out for?

Political scenario continues to evolve and next one month will set the tone for the general elections. So, market volatility is a key headwind and if GDP growth rate were to slow down then that will present as key challenge for growth.

However, the current macro situation is improving. The banking system has also passed the peak of challenges of stressed asset cycle. Overall the macro situation seems more encouraging and constructive now.

Given the backdrop of NBFC situation, how should one look at such stocks? Any bets in the financials space?

The near-term challenges of liquidity in NBFC sector are slowly receding but there are structural challenges of the cost of funds having risen for NBFC sector.

However, the companies with niche positioning and solid track record are likely to gain market share over the medium term.

We like Shriram Transport, Bajaj Finance and Mahindra and Mahindra Financial services in the space. We also like the gold financiers Muthoot and Manappuram as they have lesser challenges of asset liability mismatches and can deliver credible RoEs.

What is your outlook on some of the infrastructure or capital goods segment, given how Larsen & Toubro’s performance during Q2 has been?

Larsen & Toubro (L&T) reported strong numbers. Overall the capex cycle seems to be picking up albeit slower and later than expected. There could be some short-term challenges as government capex closer to elections is likely to dwindle, but from a medium-term perspective the sector is likely to do well as valuations are reasonable and order books are pretty strong.

What are your top 5 stock picks? Could you share the price targets and a rationale as well?

Infosys | Target: Rs 795

It is gaining ground and inching closer to the market leader in terms of deal wins but has a significant valuation gap. Offers decent upside from current levels and it is unaffected by the domestic challenges. Hence, a solid portfolio stock.

ICICI Bank | Target: Rs 390

It is a fast-improving lending book with a major cleanup. It has a solid retail franchise and well-placed to gain market share.

Sonata Software | Target: Rs 420

This high quality mid-cap IT company is available at discounted valuations of 12x FY20E earnings.

Engineers India | Target: Rs 169

All time high order book provides revenue visibility. The valuations are cheap at 13x FY20E earnings.

DCB Bank | Target: Rs 207

It is a fast-growing bank in the midcap space with solid exposure to MSME space. It is likely to gain market share from NBFCs.

This is the verbatim transcript of Asian Paints management call with analysts.

Moderator: Ladies and Gentlemen, good day, and welcome to the Asian Paints Q2 and H1 FY2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode. And there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance during the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing ‘*’ then ‘0’ on your touchtone telephone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Arun Nair. Thank you and over to you, sir.

Arun Nair: Good morning and welcome to Asian Paints Investor Call for Q2 FY19 Results. We have Mr. K.B.S. Anand – MD & CEO; we have Mr. Jayesh Merchant, who is the CFO and Company Secretary, and also President of Industrial JV; Mr. R. J. Jeyamurugan – VP, Finance; Mr. Parag Rane – Chief Manager, Finance; and myself Arun Nair from Corporate Communications.

Now I hand over the mike to Mr. KBS Anand to take the call forward.

K.B.S. Anand: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for attending our conference call. I will give a small explanation of our results and then we will take any question and answers.

The domestic economic environment continued to remain challenging with no clear signs of a secular upward trend. The same was reflected in the demand conditions within the coating industry as well. Rising crude oil prices, significant depreciation in the Rupee, tight monetary conditions have only added to this challenging business environment.

The consolidated financials, Revenue from operations increased by 8.5% to Rs. 4,639.05 crores in Q2 and by 11.8% to Rs. 9,037.64 crores in H1. PBDIT decreased by 0.8% to Rs. 847.5 crores in Q2, while it increased by 11.6% to Rs. 1,783.6 crores in H1. PBT decreased by 3% to Rs. 748.7 crores in Q2, while showing an increase of 12% to Rs. 1,596.9 crores in H1. Net Profit from continuing operations decreased by 3.8% to Rs. 506 crores in Q2, while it increased by 11.7% to Rs. 1,077.3 crores in H1.

In the standalone financials, Revenue from operations has increased by 8.7% to Rs. 3,914.2 crores in Q2 and by 12.2% to Rs. 7,620.4 crores in H1. PBDIT increased by 1.9% to Rs. 799 crores in Q2, while it increased by 15.4% to Rs. 1,692.6 crores in H1. PBT increased by 1.1% to Rs. 709.6 crores in Q2, while showing an increase of 16.5% to Rs. 1,519.5 crores in H1. Net Profit increased by 1.7% to Rs. 481.5 crores in Q2, while it increased by Rs. 17.1% to Rs. 1,024.1 crores in H1.

Please note that the figures for the previous year have been suitably adjusted to bring them in line with GST financials. One peculiarity between this year and the previous year is that in the last year, there was an impact of GST implementation in Q1, and as a result Q1 was subdued and Q2 was buoyant. This year, as a result, Q1 appears to be extremely buoyant, although on a cumulative CAGR basis it actually was not so. Similarly, Q2 appears to be subdued in retrospect, both in terms of top-line and profits, largely on account of the buoyant Q2 relatively last year.

However, on profits it was to an extent affected, as I had pointed out in last quarter’s telephone discussion that we decided not to pass on the raw material price increases during the quarter because GST had been lowered by 10% on 27th of July, in spite of high inflationary pressures in the period due to the fall in the rupee as well as increase of raw material prices. We have since then taken price increases of approximately 2.35% in the month of October 2018.

BUSINESS REVIEW - DECORATIVE

The decorative business registered a low double-digit volume growth in the current quarter. Volume growth in this quarter has been higher than the value growth, in-spite of our 3.4% price increase due to a number of factors. A much higher sale of distempers and putties in this quarter, the reasons for which could be a better Diwali or some change in sales from the unorganized sector to the organized sector; it is probably too early to say this; but the distemper, especially in the smaller markets have increased substantially. And the impact of the stoppage of our Phthalic Anhydride unit in July last year has had a value impact for the standalone business. In addition, there was a significantly higher input cost in this quarter which has affected the top-line. This input cost was given four days prior to July 27th, because we wanted to dispose-off stocks with higher MRP, because it requires massive quantity of re-stickering.

BUSINESS REVIEW - INDUSTRIAL

In the industrial business, the automotive coatings JV, (PPG-AP), witnessed good growth in the General Industrial segment. The Industrial coatings JV, (AP-PPG), continued to grow well, led by good performance in the Protective coating business and in the powder segment. Price increases taken by both the businesses were, however, not enough to counter the pressure on profitability from rising raw material costs.

BUSINESS REVIEW - INTERNATIONAL

In the international portfolio, major units like Egypt, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka continued to face challenging business conditions. In Ethiopia, difficulty in sourcing forex for imports continues to impact the operations. Incessant rains impacted sales at the unit in Sri Lanka. Reduction in fuel subsidies in Egypt added to the inflationary environment. The greenfield operations in Indonesia continue to progress on the planned trajectory, with focus on expanding the retail network.

BUSINESS REVIEW – HOME IMPROVEMENT

The scale of operations of both the businesses within the home improvement space, i.e. the kitchen business under Sleek and the Bath business under Ess Ess continued to expand with both the segments registering good growth. Both the segments continue to work on further enhancing their market reach and product portfolio.

CAPEX

The first phase of the plant at Mysuru, Karnataka, was commissioned as per planned in the month of September 2018 and we are on schedule to commission the first phase of the plant at Vizag, Andhra Pradesh in the last quarter of the current financial year. The total Capex plan for standalone operations for the current year is about Rs. 1,000 crores, including spends of about Rs. 800 crores of the two new plants.

GOING FORWARD

As mentioned earlier, rising crude prices and the depreciating rupee have added to the challenging business environment. We will need to monitor the impact of demand conditions given the less than forecasted rainfall in the monsoon season, as well as uncertainties arising from a busy election period. At the same time, we expect the raw material prices to rise further in the ongoing quarter.

In the international markets, forex sourcing difficulties in Ethiopia and the overall rising inflationary conditions continue to be a key cause of concern.

Thank you, everyone. We are happy to take any questions you may have.

Moderator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies & gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from the line of Abneesh Roy from Edelweiss. Please go ahead.

Abneesh Roy: My first question is on the standalone numbers, so your sales growth is 8.8% and you have mentioned low double-digit volume growth. So, taking assumption of 11% volume growth this works out to around 2% difference, the volume growth is higher. Plus, you would have taken some amount of price hike, so that is around 3%. So, why is there a 5% gap between this, ideally your value growth should have been higher, so you alluded to putty sales and distemper. So, if you could take us through the portfolio.

Management: So, overall, if we look at the product profile and growth rate, by and large the product profile and growth rates have been fairly consistent over the last couple of years quarter-on-quarter, given, adjusted for the vagaries of GST and things like that. So, definitely there was a much higher growth in emulsions last year in Q2 because of the impact of GST in Q1. That itself gave a higher growth rate as far as emulsions itself is concerned. Distempers have definitely shown a higher volume growth rate in this quarter; so frankly, given all the variables of GST, GST reduction, different Diwali and seasonality, probably taking value and volume growth rates for quarter-to-quarter will lead to anomalies. In addition, if you remember last year, we had shutdown the Phthalic plant around middle of July, that itself, the value growth that came from Phthalic while not significant, would add to an odd percent in terms of difference between value and volume growth. Similarly, I indicated that we took a substantial input hike this year itself when the GST reduction was announced to liquidate stocks, because we had to undertake re-stickering of some 170,000 KL of stock that we were carrying prior to the season, to a lower MRP rate. And it was not feasible to do it all across stock. So, we eased this process to complete the exercise within a short span of time by giving a fairly substantial rebate to liquidate stock. This reduced top-line automatically; Profits too; but it also affected the top-line.

Abneesh Roy: Sir one follow-up here, you mentioned in opening remarks that because of GST rate cut distempers have done well, so what would be the unorganized share in distemper, and would you expect that to continue, because this is first quarter only?

Management: It is just the first quarter, so let’s just wait. At the end of next quarter, I will give you a more specific remark.

Abneesh Roy: But what would be the percentage, unorganized?

Management: The unorganized share in distempers would be substantially higher than the overall share. So, if you take the overall share of the unorganized sector as about say 30% of the paint industry, in the case of distempers it should be at least about 40-45%.

Abneesh Roy: Sir, one more clarification here, in opening remarks you said good putty sales could point towards a better Diwali, could you elaborate on that part?

Management: No, We did not say good putty sales could point to a better Diwali, We said this was a longer Diwali so sales get staggered in a slightly different manner. Last year emulsion sales shifted from Q1 to Q2 because of the GST impact, so it has a difference in value sales.

Abneesh Roy: Sir, second question is on Indonesia, so in Q3 would you see some impact of the earthquake and tsunami? And second, in Q2 could you give some granular detail in terms of the retail outlets, any part of the portfolio which is doing better, which is not doing well and any market share, it is initial days, but any numbers you can put to those remarks?

Management: Market share is so low, I frankly cannot talk about. We are still very small. The tsunami, etc, occurred on relatively low populated island. More than 50% of the market of Indonesia is on Java, and most of our sales focus is around Java at this point of time. So, frankly, our sales is not affected. We have expanded our network; we have about 150 outlets this year and increase the range of emulsions we are selling through the network. So, the response to the products we have launched in the market has been fairly good. But, we have a long, long way to go. It is a heavy investment we are making in that country and we are on track as far as our plans are concerned. But it is like a five-year plan and we will really know how successful we are at the end of five years. But so far things look good.

Abneesh Roy: And sir last one, again on standalone, so your other cost is only slightly higher growth of rate versus sales, I would have expected slightly higher because of the crude oil related impacting your logistics cost. So, if you could comment on that part, how has that behaved? And advertising, is there some cut back because of all these? As a industry has advertising cost come down?

Management: See, this, you are again looking quarter-to-quarter, there is a later Diwali this year so advertising gets postponed automatically.

Abneesh Roy: And logistics costs, sir?

Management: See, we have two freights, the first freight is from the factory to our depots, that cost actually did not increase substantially per ton in this period. Tertiary freight that goes from the depot to the dealer did go up, but the overall impact has thereby automatically reduced. Also there are certain costs which we typically bear like conferences and all those things. So, quarter-to-quarter is not the right comparison, but there are certain additional costs that typically hit us.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Avi Mehta from India Infoline. Please go ahead.

Avi Mehta: Sir, first, I want to just check on your comment that you made about the demand environment. You said that the coatings environment is challenging with no signs of uptick. Would you argue that, I just wanted to know if you could clarify, are you calling out for weakness or is that a risk that you are seeing, if you could just help us explain that?

Management: All we was saying is that demand has been consistent at that level for the last 1.5 years.

Avi Mehta: So, you are saying, the uptick sign is what you are kind of saying is not yet kind of…

Management: There has been no dramatic change or uptick different from the past.

Avi Mehta: But sir, meaning, despite a delayed festive season, that is the understanding, correct?

Management: Yes.

Avi Mehta: Secondly, on the gross margin bit, we have seen a very sharp QoQ moderation. Now, you have indicated some certain items in your commentary which could be one off, one was liquidation, the other was the higher distemper sales. Would you be able to help us understand how much of the impact would be because of this?

Management: See, inflation was around 5% over Q1, so we have taken a 2.35% price increase in October, which ideally, we should have taken on 1st of August.

Avi Mehta: Okay, so this price increase definitely takes care of inflation as of now, should further inflation happen that is another point?

Management: Not completely, because since then the rupee has depreciated a little further and there is a little more volatility. So, we may have to make further corrective action over a period of time.

Avi Mehta: And essentially you are saying that inflation level till 2Q was taken care, but probably timing is the reason for this?

Management: Yes.

Avi Mehta: But sir, the one–offs that we were indicating, would you be able to help with that?

Management: We were trying to explain because some questions were being posed why the volume growth is higher than the value growth. What we was trying to indicate is the reasons for which we could understand there are differences between value and volume growth in-spite of approximately 3% price increase.

Avi Mehta: Sir, that I understood, that was very clear on your part. What I meant is there is a corresponding impact that will happen on margins because of this, especially the liquidation and the change in mix that you have seen. Would you be able to give us any color on what impact that would have been, just to get some sense?

Management: Percentage margin will not get impacted significantly. Yes, there would be some impact of what input we give, but the change in mix may not make a significant effect in margins.

Avi Mehta: And the liquidation bit, sir?

Management: That will have a little impact.

Avi Mehta: And lastly, if you could share any sense on the input cost trends, while currency I understand, but other than that on the crude based derivatives and titanium dioxide, how has the environment been right now?

Management: Raw material prices are more or less at the same level, it is the rupee variation that is affecting you. Some of the input costs what we are importing, one is rupee depreciation is impacting significantly, and second thing is some of the monomers and things has gone up, even expected to go up in Q3.

Avi Mehta: So, there is a inflation in monomer pricing because of the delay?

Management: See, monomers are derivative of crude, and as a result although they are not directly linked to the crude prices, they are dependent on supply and demand, they tend to have a lag effect over a period of time.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Vivek Maheshwari from CLSA. Please go ahead.

Vivek Maheshwari: My first question, you mentioned about 2.35% price hike which you took in October, you should have ideally taken in August, right?

Management: Right.

Vivek Maheshwari: Sir, does that mean, because September was a period when actually crude actually rose quite a bit and rupee depreciated again quite a bit. So, does that mean that price hike that you have taken does not factor in September inflation?

Management: Yes, it does not fully factor in September inflation, you are right.

Vivek Maheshwari: And any specific reason, so previous quarter you had rightfully called out that price hike at least for next few months would be difficult, but when you took up prices in October, given from a channel hygiene perspective you cannot keep taking up prices, why did you not go for slightly higher price hike?

Management: We were not 100% clear what the authorities are looking at post the GST reduction, whether they are looking at price hike of raw materials from 27th July till the current date or from the beginning of the quarter till the current date. So, we decided to play a safe stand, let a little more time elapse. Anyway, it was a Diwali season so we did not want too much price instability in the market. So, we decided to do step increase in pricing.

Vivek Maheshwari: And given that September saw such a large increase and you have taken up prices, the season is just around the corner, which means essentially the next price hike will be at least a few months away, right?

Management: Right.

Vivek Maheshwari: Second, sorry I have a very basic question, a follow-up to your liquidation part. So, if I understood it correctly, basically whatever you had channel inventory and whatever material would have gone out of the factory on which you would have paid 28%, the rate got changed and it became 18%. The 10 percentage point delta around 27th of July you would have given as rebates to the channel, right, that is what is getting absorbed in a way or is defeating the revenues and margins, right?

Management: No. See, we did re-sticker on our own as much stock as we could, but especially the small packs which are packed inside cartons become extremely complex to re-sticker. So, we gave the trader an additional discount in that period, not equal to 10%, significantly lower, to pick-up as much stock as possible, so we would not be that adversely affected in re-stickering all our stocks.

Vivek Maheshwari: So, that was essentially the stock which was lying with you or at your warehouses, right?

Management: Yes.

Vivek Maheshwari: Sir, what about the inventory which was in the channel, whatever it was and on the day of 27th the rates were lower, so ideally there would have been some compensation given to the channel at that point of time. Was there a substantial number or no?

Management: No, there was no compensation given, because there was no impact on the dealer network. Our retail selling price to the dealers prior to the tax remains the same, it is the GST component that has been lower from 28% to 18%. So, whatever we had billed them at 28% they would have got GST credit of 28% in their account. And even if they build that 18% after that to the end customer, they had an extra credit of 10% in their account which they could adjust in future sales. So, they had no monetary impact on them, it was a pure logistics nightmare at our end, we were very clear that we were not allowed to bill any material containing the old MRP from our depots to our customers. So, we either had to clear all stocks before 27th July or re-sticker the material. So, whatever we could not bill till 27th July, we re-stickered at the lower MRP and then sent it out to our dealer network.

Vivek Maheshwari: And one last follow-up on this one, because in my understanding looking at other FMCG companies and all, whatever was the channel inventory it was expected that that will retail at the lower price. So, was that not the case with your dealers on 27th onwards?

Management: Of course, they will sell at lower price because GST is lower.

Vivek Maheshwari: So, there was no impact of this?

Management: See, in the first case there was a total change in taxation policy. In this case there is only a reduction in GST, there is a difference in the two. So, while they got material at a higher GST, they got the credit for that. Our painting contractors, and large customers specially, are fully aware of the scenario and we have directly more than 55,000 stockiest all over the country, more than 1,500 in Bombay. So, in a competitive environment nobody is going to easily buy a higher price. They go from shop to shop to ask prices.

Vivek Maheshwari: Sure, I will probably take it offline separately. And my last question on the economic recovery, your first quarter comment was economic recovery continued to be visible in first quarter, whereas there is quite a bit of a change in second quarter. Can you just elaborate on this bit for me? Thank you very much.

Management: We did indicate that while it appeared to be good, the CAGR over two years was following a consistent pattern. It wasn’t really good as it appeared on paper. The CAGR over two years was consistent with our annual growth rates.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Amit Sachdeva from HSBC. Please go ahead.

Amit Sachdeva: Sir, much of it has been clarified, but just wanted to ask you about the distemper sales getting brought forward in this quarter. So, usually if my understanding is correct, typically Q3 is a very distemper heavy quarter just because of the festival thing as well. Now, that has been sort of brought forward because of Diwali onset and things like that. So, do you expect that mix in Q3 would be different from Q2 and you should expect maybe that Q3 should have little bit more emulsions flowing in which is going into Q4 and further Q1? How do we see mix shaping up, since there is a difference in split festive season last year this time, how is this mix which has impacted somewhat, if not too much revenue line, how the next quarter mix should you expect?

Management: See, in general, Q2 has a much higher distemper component than Q3. You are right, Q3 has a much higher emulsion component. But this year Diwali is later than last year, so Q3 would possibly have a higher distemper component this year than last year.

Amit Sachdeva: So, as you go into Q3 as well you will see much, much higher distemper component this year, going into Q3 as well?

Management: Because it is a later Diwali more distemper is sold in Q3. Now, whether dealers have stocked that much higher distemper, which I doubt, in Q2 from us is a question mark, but in general in distemper is sold largely in the pre-Diwali period in Q2 in every year. Since it is a later Diwali more distemper would be sold at least in the month of October, not in November, December but in the month of October.

Amit Sachdeva: Sir, one more thing, when we talk of input prices and look at some data as well, COGS in the standalone has grown by 11% roughly and volumes have also grown by 11%. I see some deteriorating mix which may have impacted margins or something like that. But it does not seem to show that COGS have increased so much as the input prices has swelled so much, or maybe there is some lag of the indirect component which is further due. But how do we sort of resolve this and how do you see that basket growing?

Management: So, We tried to explain that there are two, three factors where the top-line has not grown at the same level as volume. One is the mix, which we have to admit, the second is the shutdown of Phthalic vis-à-vis the previous year, the third is higher input this year specifically to get rid of GST cost. So, there are three factors that have led to this deviation.

Amit Sachdeva: But sir, the COGS have grown by just 11% in line with volumes.

Management: So, material cost in Q2 we did see a 5% inflation over Q1, but we also had the 3% price increase that we have affected from March ending. So, that helped a bit. But yes, the material cost inflation is higher. Going forward the balance we are hoping to bridge with the 2.35% increase in October.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Shruti D. from NVS Brokerage. Please go ahead.

Shruti D.: My first question is, can you throw some light on the status of the expansion of plants at Mysore and Visakhapatnam? And as stated in the annual report, this expansion will help in manufacturing of paints at the lowest cost. So, can you provide by how much percentage this cost reduction will be there in the future?

Management: We cannot answer the second question, but the first question we had already indicated that the Mysore plant has gone into production from the month of September, went into commercial production on the 20th of September 2018. And the Vizag plant is scheduled to go on production in the last quarter of this financial year.

Shruti D.: And my next question, what proportion of sales is between enamel and emulsions and distemper paints? And can you please repeat how much unorganized sector controls in this paints market?

Management: The unorganized sector is somewhere around 30% of the paint market. The other questions I cannot answer.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Aditya Soman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Aditya Soman: A couple of questions, first just on the higher input cost to dispose material. So, there is no increase in promotional intensity in the industry across the channel. And since then things have normalized to the promotional activity which as before in the first quarter or something.

Management: Yes, more or less like that. Competitor’s intensity is always there, this was not done any reason because of competitive intensity, this was done because it was purely a logistical nightmare to re-sticker 170,000 KL of stock.

Aditya Soman: And the second question, is there any difference in geographical demand across the country that you want to call out for, or has it been consistent?

Management: For us the East has been consistently growing well, the last few years South did not do well but it is showing signs of recovery this year. Kerala, as you know, has been obviously affected in this quarter, especially in the month of August which was their peak Onam season month; but other than that, it is fairly consistent.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Nillai Shah from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Nillai Shah: First question is on the JV’s profitability. I think you have pointed out the fact that the price increases were delayed and not sufficient to cover the input cost. But given that this is usually a B2B transaction why is there a delay in pricing for the JVs?

Management: Because there are big boys on the other side, they do not easily agree to increase the prices. We wish B2B was easier than B2C.

Nillai Shah: Okay. Has that been corrected more recently or still…?

Management: Partially corrected, there is a lag. See, the trouble is you are in a constantly inflationary scenario. And you have to appreciate that this has been a tough quarter even for the automobile sector and some of the industrial sectors because of the demand situation. So, they have not been very open to price increases so to speak. So, it has been constant negotiation and in an inflationary scenario when you increase prices on one day and you cannot easily go back on next day and say I need another price increase.

Nillai Shah: And that brings me to the second question, in the past whenever we have lived through very-very sharp inflationary periods we have not really had a big lag, I know now the conditions are different this time, there is GST to content with on one side and plus the demand situation. But in context of where your current margins are in context of where it was historically say three, four, five years ago, are you comfortable with the comparative scenario that Asian Paints is today in vis-à-vis the past periods?

Management: We have indicated that there is a lag in pricing to an extent essentially on account of GST. But in the case of architectural coatings, the attempt to operate at a certain operating margin which we think with which we are comfortable and can be competitive in the market place, and we are focusing towards doing that; and we do not think that has been in any way adversely affected or otherwise for the medium-term, it may have been affected for a quarter, that is a different scenario. The industrial business, of course the margins are much lower than what we would like in an inflationary scenario and we are working towards improving that.

Nillai Shah: And last question, you mentioned 170,000 KL of stock which needed re-stickering, this if I am not mistaken, works out to about 10% plus of your total output, right? Isn’t that too high, I thought your finished goods inventory levels would be just about 10 days or so?

Management: No, it is about 30 days.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tejas Shah from Spark Capital. Please go ahead.

Tejas Shah: Just picking up from your demand environment commentary, you mentioned that there was an element of unorganized to organized which also led to lower realization. Sir, usually unorganized to organize happens when the demand environment is robust and that is where the premiumization happens from that segment of demand to more organized segment. So, just wanted to understand how are you reading this trend versus the overall commentary which you made?

Management: We only related this trend to distemper sale because the proportion of the unorganized sector selling distemper is relatively higher in that segment. And because of the implementation of GST, they had a certain price disadvantage compared to how they used to operate in the past. And maybe that has pushed the sale of the organized sector a little higher. But, again, as we said, this is too early to assess, we need to see one or two quarters more before we can make purely definitive statement.

Tejas Shah: And sir was there any unusual share of Project business and decorative business, higher share of Project Sales?

Management: We have been growing consistently in Project Sale business over the last few years, and that growth has continued.

Tejas Shah: But margins in that part of the business would be lower

Management: Yes, you are right.

Tejas Shah: And sir lastly if we look at your gross margins this must be lowest in last many quarters, and you rightly pointed out that there was a lag in terms of price and action that we could have taken. So, looking at demand environment do you believe that markets can absorb further price hike if need be, without hurting volume growth momentum?

Management: We think so, but we will take that decision on the basis of as we assess the market situation.

Tejas Shah: And that will be post Diwali or before that also you can?

Management: We am sorry, We cannot give this detail. We will be informing our customers first about price revisions.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dhiresh Pathak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Dhiresh Pathak: Just to better understand the cost push, so what percentage of COGS is TIO2 and what percentage of COGS is other crude downstream monomers?

Management: Around 20-22% would be TIO2 of material cost, and all crude put together would be somewhere around 30% odd.

Dhiresh Pathak: And in terms of better understanding the mix, what percentage of sales is putty and what percentage of domestic…

Management: Sorry, We do not share information on this.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Arnab Mitra from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Arnab Mitra: After the GST rates were cut there was some expectation that there could be potentially some premiumization within the decorative segment, I am not talking about the distemper upgrade as such, but among the rest of the decorative paint segment. So, have you seen any such trend with this 10% kind of price reduction or anything else you have seen happen after the price has been cut by 10%?

Management: No.

Arnab Mitra: And sir the other question was in terms of the Karnataka facility, are there any tax incentives that you now have now that the facility has commissioned, and will it help in terms of margins in the next couple of quarters?

Management: Yes, there are certain benefits which we are in the process of getting agreed upon. Though, government has agreed we are just documenting it. Once it is done, we will communicate it.

Arnab Mitra: And lastly in terms of, again, the question on the input cost cycle. So, other than this lag effect which is coming out of your conservative stance under anti-profiteering, you do not see any major challenge in ultimately being able to pass on this inflation over the next two to three quarters, once you have better clarity on GST anti-profiteering?

Management: In architectural coatings, yes, you are right.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Richard Liu from JM Financials. Please go ahead.

Richard Liu: Sir, I just want to know how do you guys forecast or plan for cost in a year like this when you have two new large plants that is up for commissioning? The reason behind this question is, if I look at the past, whenever you have had a new large Greenfield plant coming up, for example being Rohtak and FY11-12 and Khandala being FY13-14, your other expenses line have typically grown at a significant proportion than what it typically grows at. And given that there are two of them now, I just wanted to ask for some sort of input from you as to how do you see overheads going forward?

Management: So, under Mysore front, we will have the cost impacting us for the next six months, since it is now commissioned. Vizag, we do not think any cost will hit us significantly this year because it gets commissioned only, as per plan, in the last quarter, so maybe next year. But you are right, typically in the first 1.5 – 2 years when the plant is actually running at sub-optimal sort of capacity utilization, you will have the overheads sort of kicking in at a much higher rate. We cannot quantify them for you, but there will be an impact.

Richard Liu: But given that you could be in a position to really project in terms of how capacity utilization could progress over a period in time? Is it possible to match the cost structure with the volume progression in those plants?

Management: Typically, that is not how it pans out, because you will have certain kicks first at the plants which sort of need to incur whether you produce x number or x+y, so those costs typically impact you at the sub-optimized levels.

Richard Liu: And given that these two plans have now come up, let’s say four, five years after the last one which was Khandala, and given that technology, etc, has become more efficient over a period of time, let’s say renewal energy, etc, etc, has that been an element of cost efficiencies built into these plants such that the additional hit will be lower than what we have seen earlier or the impact would be as drastic as what we have seen in case of Khandala?

Management: We have invested money in terms of upping the automation quotient at these two new plants versus say what we have in Khandala, specifically in terms of material handling cost within the plant. So, there could be some bit of optimization on that front as compared to Khandala.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Praveen Shetty, an individual investor. Please go ahead.

Praveen Shetty: Most of my questions have already been answered. I had two additional questions. First is, it is very much obvious that the market capitalization of your competitor companies are obviously going down since it is a challenging environment for all the parent companies. So, will there be any acquisitions that Asian Paints will be doing?

Management: In India, that becomes a difficult task given the kind of market standing we have and market share that we enjoy in India. So, I think that is a pretty difficult task. On the home improvement front and the international front, yes, if there are good opportunities we will scout for it.

Praveen Shetty: And my second question is, there is some kind of hyperbola statement that is being made in the markets that crude price can go up to $100 per barrel, so what will be the margin impact the companies will have? And it is very much obvious that the company will take a hit on that, but…

Management: It is too premature to comment on all these hypothesis. But earlier in the past also it has touched above $100 and we have handled that, we will see.

Praveen Shetty: No, I was just calculating the worst case scenario that can happen.

Management: Sorry, We cannot comment on that at this stage.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jigar Shah, an individual investor. Please go ahead.

Jigar Shah: Sir, would you be able to elaborate on the wood coating business separately and also give what kind of revenue and margins are there in this business? And some future outlook?

Management: Sorry, we do not give you individual breakups of revenue and margins, all we can tell you is we have a steadily growing business, we have a tie-up with an Italian company called Renner, and we manufacture some of their products in India and import others, and we are selling these premium end products through a large number of our stores all over the country and getting steady growth in the polyurethane, polyester and the water based wood finish segments.

Jigar Shah: Sir, what is the revenue?

Management: Sorry, we cannot comment on that.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Shruti D. from NVS Brokerage. Please go ahead.

Shruti D.: With respect to rising oil prices and rupee devaluation, how much percentage of your portfolio or the business is hedged?

Management: So, as we said, on the crude side our raw material exposure is close to 30% but there are not too many sort of exchange related products available for hedging. On the dollar front we typically look at short-term hedging, so maybe a month or two months, not more than that. That is where we stand as on date.

Shruti D.: But can you provide a percentage in the case of rupee devaluation, how much is hedged?

Management: We look at covering the short-term payables which is typically month or two months of exposure.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Abneesh Roy from Edelweiss. Please go ahead.

Abneesh Roy: Sir, in the international markets, some of those you are not the market leader, so where all you have been able to take the price hike and what is the quantum?

Management: So, we have been able to take price hike in almost every market, but the quantum we have been able to take varies. In most of the markets we have taken a quantum very close to what is required to recover the cost, but it is with a lag effect. So, you have to realize it has been towards the end of the quarter, so the impact is higher. Maybe one or two markets this is not true, Dubai and Sri Lanka, but otherwise by and large, we have been able to take prices to recover most of the costs.

Abneesh Roy: Sir, Dubai, what is the issue? Because the market was reviving there, crude is up?

Management: We have a very vigorous competitor after the implementation of VAT of a 5% this calendar year, he lowered prices by 5% to absorb the impact of VAT in an inflationary scenario.

Abneesh Roy: That is the market leader, right?

Management: More or less, yes; the volume market leader.

Abneesh Roy: And sir one clarification, you said the Mysore plant will lead to higher overheads, on the other hand because it will be closer to one of your bigger markets the logistics cost could also come down. Isn’t that material enough?

Management: It is material but that will help us next year as volumes pick up, in this year the impact may not be that significant.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Parthav Jonsa from NVS Brokerage. Please go ahead.

Parthav Jonsa: Sir, I just got one question. Pertaining to the auto sales, the auto sales numbers are really not so impressive off lately, how do you perceive your sector growing pertaining to this auto sector?

Management: So, we have a joint venture with PPG that caters to the auto sector, and some proportion of their businesses is to the four wheeler auto segment. They do not supply largely to the Japanese manufacturers and they supply more to the non-Japanese manufacturers. We have become about 100% supplier to Ford, etc, so actually our business has gone up. But yes, overall growth of the automotive sector is a cause of worry for us.

Parthav Jonsa: So, what would your current market share in India be, like if you can just give me some rough idea on that front?

Management: We have no idea, sorry.

Parthav Jonsa: And my very last one is on the Vizag plant, your Mysore has already started the operations, so when Vizag starts with operation in Q4 or the last quarter, what would be the production which would be coming out from that plant?

Management: Not significant in the first quarter any which ways.

Parthav Jonsa: No, I am not just asking about the first quarter, once it is fully ramped up and all?

Management: Yes, about 3 lakh KL capacity.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Keyur Pandya from ICICI Prudential. Please go ahead.

Keyur Pandya: Sir, my question is, you mentioned that we have taken price hike of 2.35% from October, which is to take care of inflation till August. So, inflation after August? That is one thing. And second thing, the deteriorating mix of distempers because of the festive season, so looking at these two things, if we do not increase the price then there will be some margin pressure in medium-term or short-term?

Management: So, there is a little margin pressure, we do not deny that. So, there is a probability of a further price increase in the quarter.

Keyur Pandya: But the general story of premiumization in paints, that is the case with most of the products in India. So, this deteriorating in the mix is a short-term aberration or how do you see that?

Management: So, the premiumization continues, We tried to indicate that the growth rate of premiumization remains the same. But there is one chunk of the market that has grown a little faster. So, if you would see the average growth rate over the last so many quarters has not been consistently 11% - 12%, it has been a little lower. This higher growth rate is probably because of the higher growth of distempers and putties.

Keyur Pandya: And that may continue for some time? That is what my point is.

Management: We hope so.

Keyur Pandya: Which would in turn impact our margins, right?

Management: No, nothing to do with the margins. If we sell more on something we make a profit, our profit goes up; We look at absolute margins more than anything else.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Pratik Poddar from Narnolia Financial Advisors. Please go ahead.

Pratik Poddar: Actually, I wanted to ask the rise in short-term debt in the consolidated books is due to the rupee depreciation, right?

Management: This is probably happening only at our international holding co level where we are using certain additional borrowings to fund the operations in Indonesia

Pratik Poddar: In which region?

Management: Indonesia.

Pratik Poddar: Another question that I have, if I look at the half yearly balance sheet it appears that you have already invested Rs. 900 crores approximately in the Capex. So, on a full year basis you had given a guidance of Rs. 1,200 crores on a consolidated basis. So, are we going to spend remaining 300 or it would increase going ahead?

Management: No, we will be within the stated Capex range.

Pratik Poddar: One last question, just to understand the other expenses better here. So, other expenses were a little bit higher due to stickering, logistics or overheads from the new plant, which would be the component which is affecting it the most?

Management: It is largely because of the inflation that we have seen in the logistic cost versus Q1, stickering cost, yes, there is a bit of it, but largely it is the logistic cost.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chinmay Gandre from Future Generali. Please go ahead.

Chinmay Gandre: Sir, just a broad estimate in terms of the rebate that we gave to the dealers because of the change in GST rate. Could it be in the range of Rs. 60 crores - Rs. 70 crores for the quarter?

Management: No, much lower.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tejas Shah from Spark Capital. Please go ahead.

Tejas Shah: Sir, just one follow-up. Sir, one of the sector peers indicated yesterday that there was some de-stocking pertaining to GST in the month of July. So, did we also experience that kind of de-stocking at dealer level?

Management: No, as indicated we had given a rebate; dealers did not want to stop material that had the old MRP because it would complicate their operations. So, we took the counter measure of incentivizing dealers to pickup stock with the old stickering. So, they lifted material. So, we probably saw higher stocking in July.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jaimin Shah from RWC Partners. Please go ahead.

Jaimin Shah: I am just trying to understand on the price increases, when you said that you plan this 2.3% increase in August, which was finally taken in October and then you had kind of rupee depreciation in crude. I am also trying to understand here, what is your margin thought process behind it, because coming from 2016, 2017 and 2018 we had these peak margins when I look at the longer term trend. So, are we thinking about margins in these last three years to kind of maintain around these levels or are we kind of going back to the longer term trend of 19% - 20%?

Management: 18% - 20% we are okay. We do not normally change pricing month-to-month and nor do we operate at that level. In a deflationary scenario which we saw two years earlier, margins suddenly increased because raw material prices are falling. And in inflationary scenario, it is the reverse. So, we want to balance the count. I think we are okay at 19% - 20% margin.

Jaimin Shah: So, these price hikes kind of keep you in that 19% - 20% range, not necessarily the peak margins that we have seen in last couple of years?

Management: Yes.

Moderator: Thank you. Ladies & gentlemen, as there are no further questions from the participants, I would now like to hand the conference over to the management for closing comments.

Management: Thank you very much, for participating in our conference. See you next quarter.

Moderator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies & gentlemen, on behalf of Asian Paints, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",8358,0.029149866104125975

In the past two months, Indian market wiped out gains it made in the year 2018. Benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty50, are down about nearly 17 percent from their respective highs which suggest that even quality stocks are now available at attractive valuations.

Just ahead of Diwali, more than 50 percent of the stocks in the S&P BSE Sensex and Nifty50 are down over 20 percent which suggests that bears have taken control, or bear phase has begun in these stocks.

""This is a Diwali sale, investors should buy good stocks. I would buy IndusInd Bank at current levels. The management of IndusInd Bank is high in quality,” Dipen Sheth of HDFC Securities said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

“We are optimistic on NBFCs like Mahindra Finance and Chola Finance. RBL Bank is a long-term investment and it is possible to see 30-35% growth rates over the medium-term,” he said.

As many as 15 out of 30 stocks in the S&P BSE Sensex are down 20-60 percent from their respective record highs which includes Tata Motors, Yes Bank, Vedanta, State Bank of India, Tata Steel, IndusInd Bank, Asian Paints, Hero MotoCorp.

Many experts feel that for stocks which have fallen over 20 percent can't be said to be in a bear phase because what we are witnessing it is more of event-based correction.

The Indian equity market remained in uptrend during the last 4 years with seasonal corrections of 5-6 percent on event basis but managed to resume the rally.

As the price was running ahead of earning by about 15x-20x, especially in small and mid-cap companies at the end of FY18, it was prudent to see the correction on account of muted earnings growth which is happening currently on board level, suggest experts.

“The current correction doesn’t augur completely a bear phase on broad-level but it is more of event-based correction which is not in favour of market coupled with overhung valuation concerns that peaked in the recent period,” Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“We have seen few quality large-cap companies correcting more than 20% due to slipover effect despite a strong fundamental. Although select-stocks may have entered the bear phase which doesn’t promise the future earnings growth, but overall market is only witnessing an event based correction that have a slipover effect on stock level,” he said.

Corrections in the price are more fierce in small & midcaps as compared to benchmark stocks. This creates a buying opportunity in quality management and business. However, every stock which plunged in double-digits does not qualify as a quality buy, suggest experts.

Among the Nifty50 names, over 50 percent or 28 out of 50 stocks have plunged 20-60 percent which include HPCL, BPCL, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Bharti Infratel, Vedanta, IOC, Adani Ports, Bajaj Auto and UPL.

“Corrections in the price in the recent times have been sharper or close to 20-25%, this creates a buying opportunity in quality management and business. Every falling knife is not bound to cut your hands,” Ritesh Ashar CSO KIFS TradeCapital told Moneycontrol.

“In recent times, the correction was due to global sentiments and overvaluations in some of the stocks. For example stock like Bharat Forge is moving in a secular uptrend and due to recent correction in the market the stock has corrected from the level of 693 to 541 but that doesn’t mean that the stock is in the downtrend. At this point of time one must look for stocks which are in a secular uptrend and can give better returns when the market turns around,” he said.",607,-0.0634894912893122

JM Financial's research report on Asian Paints

We move Asian Paints to BUY from HOLD as we now find valuation to be in a reasonable zone after two years of near-zero return. The stock price has swung from its 52-week high of INR1,467 on the day of its 1QFY19 result to near-52-week low level post a 5% fall today in possibly a reaction to a weak 2QFY19 earnings report, due in part to some once-off factors that impacted the quarter’s profitability. We are quite confident, though, that margin performance going forward will be much better vs 2QFY19’s, given elements of constraint (deferral of price-hike to avoid attracting anti-profiteering provisions) and once-off rebating (on transition stocks at the time of GST rate cut) present in the latter - issues that are unlikely to repeat soon.

Outlook

The industry construct remains as attractive (our proprietary framework built to analyse volume drivers backs our conviction that the organised Paints industry in India has the potential to deliver a 10%+ volume CAGR over the next decade) and target valuation no longer needs to be in the 50x zone to deliver an acceptable return vs CMP. Our 12M forward TP of INR1,380/share is based on 45x Sep’20 EPS - we see 22% total upside.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian Paints

We upgrade Asian Paints from Hold to Accumulate despite ~13% EPS cut as ~24% correction in stock price from the recent peak provides a good opportunity to play a secular growth story. APNT faces near term headwinds led by 1) dampening of customer sentiments 2) deterioration in sales mix with higher sales growth in Distemper and Putti and 3) input cost inflation led by rising crude prices and INR depreciation.

Outlook

Although FY19 PAT growth is estimated at only 6.7%, We estimate CAGR of 15.1% in revenue and 19.9% in Adj. PAT over FY19-21. We value the stock at 45xSept20 EPS of 28.9 and arrive at a target price of 1300 (Earlier Rs1431). Upgrade to ""Accumulate"".

ICICI Direct's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints’ (APL) Q2FY19 performance was operationally weak in EBITDA margin terms. We believe paint volume growth at ~10% YoY was achieved through a change in product mix while APL refrained from taking a price hike in an inflationary scenario looking at festive demand around the corner. It has instead passed on the GST rate cut to its dealers with immediate effect to fast liquidate the inventory. APL has taken a price hike of 2.35% effective from October 1, 2018 and guided at a few more price hikes in upcoming quarters to negate the impact of higher crude related raw material prices and adverse currency movements. However, demand being more skewed towards lower end products like distemper, we believe margin pressure would remain in near future We believe the volume CAGR of ~13% in FY18-20E would be largely supported by a shorter repainting cycle and increasing presence in the southern region through two news facilities (with capacity of 3 lakhs/KL each) in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. We also believe the company would gradually take a price hike to maintain EBITDA margin in the range of ~18-19%.

JM Financial's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints’ 2QFY19 report was a clear disappointment – more from a mix/margin angle, even as volume growth of ‘low double-digit’ turned out to be tad higher vs our forecast of c.8%. What is not clear, though, is how a double-digit volume growth translated into a mere 8.5% growth in revenue, considering the cumulative price-hike of 3.5% effected thus far (1.5% in Mar’18 plus 2% in May’18; the pricing action in Jul’18 was realisation-neutral, i.e. price-cut was effected to entirely pass on the 10ppt cut in GST rate). This apparent deterioration in mix further pressured margin which seems to have compressed much more than warranted by the inflation in RM prices. One possible explanation could be additional trade payouts to re-imburse for value-loss on transition stocks due to the tax cut but considering the lean trade inventory, we reckon the impact of the same would be no more than 1-1.5ppt.

Outlook

The stock could trade down on the back of this result; we await management’s view on the mix-related issue. The stock is nearly flat vs 12M ago level, and the current result could provide a good entry opportunity into what we still view as a very attractive long-term business franchise.

Asian Paints is scheduled to report its September quarter earnings on October 22. The company may report a marginal increase in net profit and revenues, according to Phillip Capital.

The research firm expects the net profit of Asian Paints to rise by 5 percent year-on-year to Rs 533.8 crore for the September quarter. But, sequentially it could see a rise of 23 percent in Q2 net profit, said the report.

Revenues are expected to grow by 11 percent YoY.

The firm expects volume growth to be impacted due to shifting of festival season to Q3 and GST‐related disruption on cuts in rate to 18 percent from 28 percent.

EBITDA may decline 90bps YoY due to subdued volume growth, start ‐up costs relating to commencement of its Mysuru plant, and commodity‐related inflation.

Gross margin may remain under pressure due to spiralling Titanium Dioxide (mainly used as a white pigment), crude oil prices, rupee depreciation and company deferring price hikes to Q3 owing to strict vigilance from anti‐profiteering activities, the report further said.",184,-0.0046473244825998945

Nifty fell nearly 2 percent, or over 200 points, for the week ended September 28. The index witnessed its fifth consecutive weekly fall.

The index breached its crucial support placed at 11,000 on the weekly basis for the first time since July. The price action on the charts suggest that market is in a downtrend but after falling consecutively for the last 4-5 weeks, a pullback rally could be on the cards.

Bulls should only be able to regain control if the index reclaims 11,170 levels comfortably else we may consolidate around current levels. A close below 10,800 could further extend the selling pressure and take the index towards 10,700-10,600 levels, suggest experts.

""At this juncture after taking a hit of around 8 percent from the highs of 11,760 with 4-weeks of continuous fall, we should expect some pullback rather than looking to go short at current levels,"" Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol.

""Bulls should be able to regain control if Nifty50 manages to close above 11,170 levels. If the index closes above 11,17o, the next resistance level stands at 11,350 levels. On signs of weakness around these levels, one can initiate fresh shorts with a target placed between 10,700 and 10,600 kind of levels,"" he said.

Here is a list of top 10 money making ideas by experts which could give 5-16% return in the next 1 month:

Analyst: Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking

Lupin: Buy| LTP: Rs 900.9| Initiation range: 890-900| Target: Rs 980| Stop loss: 860| Return: 9%

Lupin witnessed a decent profit taking and found support around the multiple moving averages (200/100/50-EMA) on the daily chart. It is rebounding from thereon and is likely to maintain this bias ahead as well. Traders should use this dip to initiate fresh longs through Call option as per the mentioned levels.

Canara Bank: Sell Futures| Last Close: Rs 221.2| Initiation range: Rs 225-230| Target: Rs 200| Stop Loss: Rs 240| Return: 9.5%

After it failed to cross its resistance hurdle of multiple moving averages around Rs 294, Canara Bank has witnessed a steep fall of late and is likely to maintain this bias ahead too.

Further, we have similar indications from majority PSU banking counters. We advise using any uptick to create fresh shorts within the given range.

Titan Company: Sell Futures| Last Close: Rs 806.8| Initiation range: Rs 815-825| Target: Rs 760| Stop Loss: Rs 840| Return 5%

Titan Company has been consolidating for the past ten months now and has formed a distribution pattern “Head and Shoulder” on the weekly chart. It is trading on the verge of a breakdown from the same and is likely to witness a sharp fall.

The positioning of confirmation indicators is also in sync. Traders should use any bounce to go short in the mentioned zone.

Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Asian Paints: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,294 | Target: Rs 1,370 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,267 | Return 6%

Last three weeks of price action is looking quite interesting with long lower shadows on the weekly charts which suggest that dips are getting bought into this counter.

Even in the last two sessions, the bulls of this counter remained indifferent to the wild swings witnessed in the broader markets.

Hence, on a sustainable pullback rally, this counter should trade somewhere around Rs 1,377 levels. The near-term strength will get cemented on a close above Rs 1,336 levels. Positional traders should buy into this with a stop of Rs 1,267 for a target of Rs 1,370.

Axis Bank: Buy| LTP: Rs 612 | Target: Rs 649 | Stop Loss: Rs 587 | Return 6%

The price behaviour of the last four sessions in this counter is looking quite interesting as it appears to be building a decent base between Rs 620 – 590 levels from the cushion of which it can rally.

In such a scenario a decent upmove towards Rs 655 can’t be ruled out. Hence, traders are advised to buy into this counter for a target of Rs 649 with a stop of Rs 587.

L&T Finance Holdings: Buy| LTP: Rs 129 | Target: Rs 147 | Stop Loss: Rs 117| Return 14%

This counter appears to have hit a short-term bottom after retracing around 50 percent of its entire up move from the lows of Rs 48 – 213 levels as it is consolidating in a narrow zone of Rs 120 – 135 levels.

On sustaining above Rs 120 levels, it can easily pullback to test its 21st September high of Rs 151 levels. Hence, positional traders can make use of this opportunity to go long for a target of Rs 147 levels with a stop of Rs 117.

Brokerage Firm: Narnolia Financial Advisors Ltd

ITC: Buy| Buy Range: Rs 287-290|Target: Rs 335 | Stop Loss: Rs 267 | Return 16%

Selling in ITC seems to be absorbed by buyers after witnessing almost 50 percent correction from the peak of Rs 323 marks. The stock seems to be bottomed out near 50% Fibonacci retracement of the entire upward swing from Rs 259 to Rs 323 levels which is supportive for the Bulls.

The emergences of Morning Star pattern near the same suggest reversal in the coming sessions. Currently, it is retesting its previous neckline of the Cup and Handle pattern on the weekly chart which is around Rs 288 levels.

Strong support is seen near Rs 280-285 zones where 61.8% Fibonacci retracement is located of the same upward swing. Traders can buy around Rsc290 with a stop loss below Rs 267 and a target of Rs 335.

NTPC: Buy| Buy Range: Rs 160-162|Target: Rs 186| Stop Loss: Rs 149| Return 15%

The stock seems to have bottomed out at the levels Rs 149 mark and from that level, it has given a breakout and surged higher. Currently, inverse Head & Shoulder is emerging on the daily chart in which the right shoulder is still pending.

But, from current levels, the risk-to-reward ratio is looking favorable. Indicators and oscillator are also conducive for the price action. One can take a long position around Rs 162-160 with a stop loss of Rs 149 and a target of Rs 186.

ICICI Bank: Buy| Buy Range: Rs 305| Target: Rs 345| Stop Loss: Rs 285| Return 13%

After the recent fall, the scrip seems to have bottomed out near its channel support line. It found a base near 50% Fibonacci retracement of the upside move from Rs 266 to Rs 346.80 which is giving hope to bulls for making long position in the scrip.

The 200-DMA is seen around Rs 305 levels which is key support. The weekly chart is showing parity with its historical levels. Oversold stochastic is also lending support to its price action. Traders can go long in the stock around Rs 305 levels with a stop loss of Rs 285 and a target of Rs 345 marks.

Mahanagar Gas: Buy| Buy around: Rs 800 |Target: Rs 900| Stop Loss: Rs 755| Return 12.5%

The scrip has given a sharp fall after hitting a peak of Rs 986.80 and it seems to be halting its downswing as it has found a strong base near the levels of Rs 790-800 levels where congestion zone is seen.

Positive divergence is seen in RSI and occurrence of double bottom price pattern indicates upside move. We saw a positive crossover in MACD & the declining histogram imply positive move on the northward side. Traders can buy around Rs 800 with a stop loss of Rs 755 and a target of Rs 900 levels.

2018-09-05 16:57:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/podcast-digging-deeper-the-asian-paints-story-colour-coding-the-success-mantra-2920001.html,"""Har Ghar Kuch Kehta hi,” says the Asian Paints punch line and it in a way sums up the brand's lasting relationship with the Indian consumer.

On today's Digging Deeper with Moneycontrol, we will share with you the story of the homegrown brand that has gone global as it manufactures, sells and distributes paints, coatings, products related to home decor, bath fittings and even provides a bouquet of related services.

Asian Paints is today India's largest and Asia's second largest paints corporation. It rules the Indian paint industry with 54.1 percent of the market share and it is the holding company of Berger International.

The beginning as was the case with most pre-independent businesses in India was in response to the Swadeshi movement and the company was initiated in a garage in Mumbai by four friends Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani and Arvind Vakil in February 1945.

Post the tumultuous years of World War II and the Quit India Movement, the company faced a few setbacks but by 1952, Asian Paints was reporting an annual turnover of Rs 23 crore and by 1967, it had become the leading paints manufacturer in the country.

The four families continued to hold the majority shares of the company but acrimony began to simmer within the unit over the global rights in the 1990s. The conflict led to the Chokseys selling their 13.7 percent shares and subsequently, the Choksey shares were bought by the remaining three families and Unit Trust of India (UTI). The Choksi, Dani and Vakil families hold a share of 47.81 percent in the company

The consumer-friendly brand

Much like its once famous mascot Gattu, Asian Paints never resisted the idea of identifying itself with the budget conscious consumer. In the 1950s, for instance, the company launched a ""washable distemper"", which was a notch above the inexpensive distemper and the rather steeply positioned plastic emulsions.

This became one of their signature creations and came to be known as Tractor Distemper with the famous tagline “Don't lose your temper, use Tractor Distemper."" Till date, the product is advertised as an affordable paint for those who want an impressive home but without burning a hole in their pockets.

The advertising smarts of the company have constantly created a certain connection between the products and the consumers.

For instance, in 1954 the distinctive mascot, Gattu, was created by none other than RK Laxman and he became the keynote of Asian Paint's unassuming, relatable brand appeal with the image of a young dishevelled painter.

The image went on to be used in print advertisements and packaging till the 1970s and by 1990s was also seen in TV ads.

The message of “Any surface that needs painting needs Asian Paints” tied up with the image that was as iconic as the Amul girl.

According to a 2015 piece in Business Standard, after the introduction of Gattu in 1954, sales zoomed ten-fold at Asian Paints because he was more relatable than say rival Jenson & Nicholson's- “When you think of colour, think of us” campaign.

Gattu appealed to the masses and helped Asian Paints become the leader, according to the Business Standard piece.

What the image did was to bring not the consumer but the painters who actually drive the painting industry to the forefront. But in the years to come, the consumer was wooed and also made to feel special with the Ogilvy & Mather tag line, ""Har Ghar Kuch Kehta Hai,"" conveying that every home's story through various key moments needed to be told through Asian Paints' colour palette.

The Business Standard piece also states, ""This was the post-liberalisation era, a home became a living space, where the consumer wanted to express herself. Decorating one's home via painting was one of the ways. The tagline lifted paints into the lifestyle domain.”

Of course, the Mumbai-based company, adds the article, which began in a small garage in the forties also pushed the envelope in product development, marketing and distribution.

Not forgetting the importance of covering all bases, literally, in the 1990s, the company advertised their brand's dependability in protecting and beautifying the exterior of the Indian home in every weather.

Despite controversy plaguing its move to drop Gattu as its face in the 2000s, the future forward attitude of the company has held it in good stead.

According to Business Standard, “It was trying to shake off its mass-market tag for a more premium appeal in the 21st century.""

To expand its appeal, says the article, since then, the company has rejigged its brand portfolio and kept the emphasis on a few strong brands, neatly clubbed under verticals like exterior (Apex Ultima), interior (Tractor Emulsion, Royale, Royale Play), solutions (Ezycolour) and waterproofing (SmartCare).

Asian Paints has even been organising workshops and creating in-depth research modules with design professionals to predict the colour trends every year.

The company has consistently offered new ideas to approach colour via concepts like Colour World (Dealer Tinting Systems where consumers can pick colours from a shade card and the exact tint can be mixed right before their eyes), Home Solutions (A painting service that brings convenience right to your doorstep) , Kids World (Fun ideas for children's rooms), and Royale Play- where special effects are created through various techniques with brushes, rollers, stencils and more.

The company has also consolidated its earlier home solutions offerings under its paint solutions brand, Ezycolour, to move into the services space. In keeping with the new cutting-edge brand image, the Asian Paint logo is also shorter and crisper today.

Collaborations with the likes of Nippon Paints Company Ltd Japan has also helped Asian Paints to keep refreshing its technical expertise in complex areas like the manufacturing of powder and coil coatings.

There were other significant collaborations too, as in the year 1993 when they set up a joint venture unit along with their overseas subsidiaries in Queensland Australia for manufacturing paints enamels and varnishes.

In 1995, the company set up another joint venture unit to manufacture paints enamels and varnishes in the Republic of Mauritius. And in 1996, the company and PPG Industries Inc. of the US set up a joint venture called Asian PPG Industries Pvt Ltd, to market as well as manufacture automotive paints and certain industrial products.

An ever-increasing footprint

As we have already said before, Asian Paints Ltd is India's largest paint company and according to information in the public domain, the company has operations in over 22 countries with 27 paint manufacturing facilities servicing consumers in 65 countries through Berger International, SCIB Paints, Apco Coatings and Taubmans. The company has manufacturing plants in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Haryana.

A crucial role in its success has been played by Asian Paints' balancing act between its wide range of paints for decorative purposes and for industrial use. They offer among other things, automotive paints, interior wall finishes, exterior wall finishes, enamels and wood finishes.

As early as in 1998, they introduced many new market winning products including a range of wood finishes, the super successful ACE Exterior Emulsion and the ever dependable painting staple, the Asian wall putty.

In 2000, they launched two variants in polyurethane (PU) wood finish under the brand name Opal. In 2001, the company introduced Utsav Enamel for the festival season. Duracast PebbleTex and CrossTex are part of the textured exterior paint range.

Here is a timeline according to Business Line, of the journey, Asian Paints has been on since 1945.

Asian Paints was incorporated in the year 1945.

In the year 1965, the name of the company was changed to Asian Paints (India) Pvt Ltd.

In 1973, the company was converted into a public limited company.

Soon after, Asian Paints went through an updation and modernisation of production facilities to keep up with the increased demand for its products.

In 1985, Asian Paints established a third paint unit. This was interestingly at Patancheru, a little-known area near Hyderabad which became the manufacturing hub for over 15000 MT of paints and enamels.

In 1987, the company initiated a plant for the manufacture of synthetic rubbers lattices with a capacity of 1200 tonnes per annum.

Among many of its joint ventures, were the 1990 joint venture companies called Asian Paints (South Pacific) Ltd in Fiji and Asian Paints (Tonga) Ltd.

In May 1991 the company acquired 1910000 equity shares of Pentasia Chemicals Ltd from Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) and thus PCL became a subsidiary of the company.

During 1992-93, informs Business Line, the company installed and commissioned a manufacturing facility for powder coatings with a capacity of 300 MT at the Kasna plant, near Greater Noida.

In 1999, informs Business Line, the company acquired 76 percent of the equity stake in Sri Lanka-based Delmege Forsyth & Co (Paints) Ltd. They opened a manufacturing plant in Oman in partnership with a local company. They also acquired the entire paints business of Pacific Paints Company based in Australia.

In 2002, the company revamped their international operations and among other key steps, also acquired a controlling stake of 50.1 percent in Berger International Singapore.

Over the years, new technology and brand licensing agreements and tie-ups with international partners, acquisitions, expansion via new paint plants and manufacturing facilities, new distribution centres, new product launches have kept Asian Paints ahead of its competitors.

It also entered the home improvement and design space in India with the acquisition of Sleek International Private Limited, a kitchen solutions provider, and also has acquired the brand network and sales Infrastructure of Ess Ess Bathroom products Pvt Ltd and will now be a key player in the bath fittings business.

In 2015 Business Standard piece, B Ramanathan, managing partner, Ogilvy & Mather, the agency that has been associated with the company for the last 30 years said, ""In the last three to four decades, the company has transited from being a paint-can company to a solutions provider, moving to surfaces beyond walls, with metal and wood finishes.""

The ever-evolving success mantra

A Moneycontrol interview with author Saurabh Mukherjea delves deep into his book, 'Unusual Billionaires’ where he decodes successful businesses using economist John Kay's famous framework of innovation, reputation, architecture & strategic assets.

One of the companies that Mukherjea discusses is Asian Paints and he says, “To explain what lies behind the seven decades of continued excellence at Asian Paints, there is a chart in the book, that shows it is not just Asian Paints’ revenue growth, but also improving return on capital employed (ROCE) for nearly four decades and improving profit margins for nearly three decades. I know there is no other company in India that has pulled it off. I doubt, if I even did a global search, I would find any other company like this.""

""The ability of the three families to work cohesively, emphasises the family’s focus on the company itself. What they have done very well is to stay focused on one industry- on paints. Even as India changes, their focus on paints has been broadly unwavering. There are a few other lines that they have begun, but the core focus of the business has been paints and as a result, they have pulled away from the rest of the paints industry in a way that I do not think I have seen in any other industry in India. The market leader, nearly 50 percent market share, multi-decadal dominance, it is very rare to see in any country in any industry,"" he added.

In a 2016 Business World interview, one of Asian Paints' most important strategists, Kanwar Bir Singh or KBS Anand, also chief executive officer and managing director recalled the journey of how over the four decades since he joined the company after leaving IIT-Mumbai in 1979, the company has grown to have around $ 2 billion in top line and profits higher than the combined numbers of its next three immediate rivals, including world No 1 AkzoNobel, Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac.

KBS is credited with the brand's strategy to look beyond paints and make Asian Paints a holistic home decor solutions company that today also offers kitchen and bathroom solutions, wallpaper and colour consultancy.

One of the major reasons behind Asian Paints' success is its ability to connect with its dealers, consumers across various economic demographics and also its understanding that every colour template must evolve to keep up with the future.

In order to achieve that, says the Business World piece, the company has created a seven-member Technology Council to brainstorm on the company’s technology needs and zoom in on business opportunities based on technological prowess. This approach- along with customer feedback garnered through multiple ways inspires the company to launch new products and also strengthen its front-end in a big way.

""Asian Paints does not have distributors - it supplies its paints directly to 45,000 retail shops across India through 125 depots. In a brilliant move, it has now tied up with retailers to tailor its service according to customer needs. So, in the past three years, it has added 250 “Colour Ideas” stores to take this format’s count up to 300. A colour consultant from Asian Paints sits in these stores, and gives advice to consumers on paint solutions for their homes,"" wrote the Business World.

Setting trends

In a 2016 Forbes India piece, KBS, however, made a startling admission when he said, ""The biggest eye-opener was that no one is interested in paint.”

This conclusion was drawn in 2000 after a year-long customer engagement exercise by Asian Paints.

According to Forbes, this was the longest-ever customer engagement the company had done with over 850 interviews and group discussions.

""What was found is that paint as a product was very low on people’s minds, only coming to the surface every three to four years when it was time for home improvement. Second, it was the woman of the house who was the actual customer. And there was a third, rather self-affirming realisation: The only brand customers know and recall is Asian Paints,"" wrote Forbes.

The last revelation, of course, strengthened the company's resolve to continue to reinforce brand recall with steps like recruiting professionals like KBS from the Indian Institutes of Management or installing the first mainframe computer or doing demand forecasting.

The findings, says KBS laid the blocks for almost all the new initiatives the company made over the next decade and a half including introducing the Royale brand and an array of textures, which went down well with the users.

""Asian Paints also started marketing paints in small packs. Priced at Rs 80-90, these gave customers a chance to paint a small part of the wall in their houses and then come back for larger packs to complete the job. This success, in turn, led the top management at Asian Paints to conclude that the customer wanted choices and was hungry for more information. Enter the Colour with Asian Paints store,” wrote Forbes.

In 2007, says Forbes, in Mumbai’s tony suburb of Bandra, Asian Paints launched a paint store unlike any seen before.

""Spread over 5,000 square feet, its aim was to provide customers with advice on painting and decorating their homes. Customers would come in and spend time with a ‘colour consultant’ who would work with them on various paint types, different shades and textures. Advice on accessories like wallpaper and stencils was also given. Most importantly, there was no expectation to buy. It was an exercise in customer engagement. Women and children loved the place and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive,"" wrote Forbes

This was the first time the company was interacting with the customer directly, says KBS in the Forbes piece and this then led to a text messaging service through which customers were sent a booklet on paints yielded a stunning 300,000 queries in the first year.

The queries doubled in the second year. While these stores created an incredible brand connect, the cost of operations was prohibitive and the company had to restrict the stores to Mumbai, New Delhi and Kolkata. But this initiative shows the foresight the company has shown to keep up with its customers.

It also set up much smaller versions of these stores within dealer shops across the country. The company now also offers colour consultancies at home, informs Forbes.

The use of IT for predictive demand analysis and automation of factories has also kept the company ahead of its competitors.

Asian Paints also set up a large-format, dealer owned store in Coimbatore where customers can buy lighting from Philips, furniture from Pepperfry, D’Decor furnishings, sanitary ware by Hindware and Somany Ceramics’ tiles in addition to kitchen and bath fittings.

The aim is to have a one-stop shop for home needs, says Forbes. Customers can also get a 3D rendering of what their house will look like, a feature that has proved to be a success.

On the anvil now are augmented manufacturing and production facilities, modernisation of older plants and constant evaluation of strengths and weaknesses and course correction when needed.

In Asian Paint's story, every tint and brush stroke speaks of the tireless commitment to the big picture which just keeps on growing bigger with time. In this case, success truly comes in many colours and strength also comes in the unity of the three families, at the helm of affairs. This many have attributed is the backbone of the Asian Paints success story.",2907,0.8114078715443611

Dolat Capital's research report on Asian Paints

APL’s high-volume trajectory continues with strong ~13-14% growth during Q1FY19. The performance was impressive considering further reduction in volume growth gap between APL and Kansai. In FY18 APL reported lower volume growth compared to Berger and Kansai. We believe that the improvement in the volume growth was primarily due to improvement in the rural growth. Going ahead, we believe that the growth momentum in the paints industry would sustain considering

Outlook

Further, the shift from unorganised to organised would aid the company to improve market share. In addition, we are revising our margin estimates by 100bps for FY20E considering revision in GST rate and Q1 performance Maintain ACCUMULATE with TP of ` 1,500 (52x FY20 EPS).

Asian Paints, one of the largest paint companies in India, started off the financial year 2018-19 with 30 percent profit growth in June quarter, backed by operational performance and product price hike. The growth was also due to low base in the previous year.

Consolidated profit for the quarter stood at Rs 571.3 crore, which increased from Rs 440.7 crore in corresponding period last fiscal.

Revenue from operations grew by 15.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,390 crore with double digit volume growth in the decorative paint business.

EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) shot up 31.4 percent year-on-year to Rs 874.5 crore and margin expanded by 250 basis points to 19.9 percent in Q1FY19.

Numbers except revenue were ahead of analyst estimates. Analysts on an average had expected profit at around Rs 535 crore on revenue of Rs 4,410 crore. Operating EBITDA was estimated at Rs 835 crore and margin at 18.71 crore for the quarter.

Asian Paints said it is taking steps to pass on the benefit of GST rate reduction to the customers but it is seeing a continuous increase in raw material prices and expects an inflation of almost 10 percent in the second quarter.

The company further said it has passed only a part of this impact through the cumulative 3.3 percent price increases taken in March and May and should have ideally looked at further price increase. ""However, we may need to defer it due to the GST rate reduction.""

On July 21, GST Council reduced rate on paints, wall putty and Varnish to 18 percent from 28 percent.

Its international operations faced challenging conditions with issues like forex unavailability, difficult weather conditions impacting business performance.

""Both the businesses in the home improvement category viz. the Kitchen (Sleek) and Bath (Ess Ess) business registered strong growth in the quarter,"" KBS Anand, Managing Director and CEO said.

The Nifty ended Tuesday’s trading session with a subtle gain of around half a percent at 10,699.90 due to global cues. The market remained rangebound throughout the day as traders remained cautious ahead of Q1 earnings beginning next week.

The index continues to oscillate back and forth in a broader range. The upper end of the range is placed around 10,850 levels while the lower end is positioned at 10,550.

If the Nifty manages to breach 10,850 levels on the upper side on a closing basis, then it can resume the uptrend, taking it to higher levels of 10,930 and 11,014. However, a trade below 10,550 can trigger a correction to 10,440 and 10,360 levels.

The relative strength index is also oscillating between 37 and 62, which indicates that the sideways bias could remain in the short term. The volatility index ended down 2.77 percent at 13 and is trading at the lower end of the range, indicating indecisiveness.

On the options front, maximum call open interest (OI) of 36.58 lakh contracts is seen at 11,000 strike, followed by 10,800, which now holds 28.81 lakh contracts. Maximum put OI of 55.26 lakh contracts is seen at 10,600 strike, followed by 10,700, which now holds 34.88 lakh contracts.

As per options data, immediate support for the Nifty is seen around 10,600 and 10,500, whereas 10,800 and 11,000 will act as an immediate hurdle before June expiry.

Asian Paints is embarking on its largest capacity expansion this fiscal year, investing Rs 4,000 crore at its Visakhapatnam and Mysuru facilities to add 1.1 million kilo litre to its present output.

The city-headquartered company is setting up plant with a 5 lakh KL per annum capacity at Visakhapatnam at an investment of Rs 1,785 crore and a 6 lakh KL plant at Mysuru pumping in Rs 2,300 crore.

""We are in the midst of our largest capacity expansion. In the first phase, two mega plants with initial capacities of 3,00,000 KL per annum each of water-based paints would be commissioned at Mysuru and Visakhapatnam in FY19,"" Asian Paints managing director & chief executive KBS Anand said in the annual report.

Asain Paints, which is the domestic market leader, operates in 16 countries and have 25 manufacturing facilities globally, catering to consumers in over 60 countries.

Its industrial coatings business was badly affected in the second half of FY18 due to GST as well rising input costs. But launch of industrial tinting machines in the dealer networks, and the success of its direct-to metal coatings, it could not only retain market share but in fact increase it in the second half of FY18, Anand said.

In the automotive paints segment, the company added Ford and Hyundai during the year. It could also gain market in share in the twowheeler space.

However, Anand said international business did not perform well. While a weak economy and a highly deflated currency hit its Egyptian operations, Ethiopia and Sri Lanka also did not do well. But higher sales in Nepal, Oman and Bahrain could contain some the impact of the poor show by the above markets.

He said the greenfield operations in Indonesia as well as acquisition of Causeway Paints in Sri Lanka have increased its global revenue.

Having completely existed the low growth Caribbean markets, Asian Paints is now focusing on expanding its portfolio into the emerging markets of Asia and Africa, chairman Ashwin Choksi said.

He further said the uncertainty is likely to continue in the current financial year as well, citing the general elections and a slew of assembly polls.

The Nifty in the previous session ended 0.2 percent lower at 10,718.05. Failing to breakout resistance placed around 10,780 followed by day long consolidation around 10,700 mark led to a bearish body candle on daily chart.

Considering the broader up-trend we still prefer buy-on-dips around critical supports placed around 10,700 and 10,640. Upside pivotal resistance is placed around 10,780.

On the Nifty hourly chart; ADX is trending higher and recovered above twenty despite RSI shows negative divergence, which implies this uptrend is likely to continue further. Hence, intraday dip towards 10,700 and 10,640 might be a decent opportunity for the next leg of up-move towards 10,780 and 10,820.

Nifty patterns on multiple time frames show; it ended the session with a bearish body candle around 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, placed around 10,700, of the entire correction from Nifty all time high to its recent low around 9950 levels. However, we don’t rule out Nifty retesting 10,640, which might be decent buying opportunity.

The Bank Nifty in the previous session ended 0.14 percent higher at 25,568.30. Upside resistance is placed around 25,750. Downside pivotal support is placed around 25,340.

Bank Nifty 'Option Chain' analysis in terms of percentage change in OI (at the end of yesterday’s session) - Bank Nifty Fut (CMP- 25643.70) ended at 75 points premium against Bnak Nifty (CMP- 25,568.30). Huge long OI build up in 25'700-PE followed by 25'600-PE, 25’500-PE, and 25’400-PE against minor long OI build up in 25'600-CE and 25'700-CE ahead of today’s expiry suggests, Bank Nifty Fut is likely to face resistance on rise around 25,700.

Bank Nifty Fut may continue to face resistance on rise around 25,700. On a similar note, intraday trend is expected to remain negative within the broader trading band of 25,700 to 25,400.

This view is subject to change if and only if Bank Nifty Fut starts moving decisively above 25,700.

Based on thorough technical study, the research firm recommends Asian Paints which can give up to 5% return in the near short term:

Asian Paints: Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1260, stop loss: Rs 1170, Return: 5%

The stock ended the session with a bullish body candle above the previous reversal point around Rs 1200. Steeply rising RSI is an indication if strengthening uptrend.

Based on above mentioned observations, the house recommends Asian Paints as a buy on dips for the short-term upside target of Rs 1260.

The Nifty, which started on a bullish note ignoring muted global setup, failed to hold on to the momentum in the last hour of trade and closed near its opening levels making a ‘Long Legged Doji’ kind of pattern on the daily charts.

A typical long-legged Doji pattern is formed when the opening price is almost equal to the closing price but there was a lot of intraday movement on either side. The Nifty opened trading at 10,592 and closed at 10,584 on Monday. But, it witnessed a movement of 124 points in trade.

The Nifty rose to an intraday high of 10638 but then bears pushed the index lower below 10550 levels to touch an intraday low of 10514.95. The index finally closed 20 points higher at 10,584.

The Nifty witnessed profit booking at higher levels and now a close above 10630 could open up fresh target towards 10900 levels for the index. Till that time, investors are advised to remain cautious, suggest experts.

India VIX move up by 1.15 per cent at 13.08. On the options front, maximum Put OI was seen at 10500 followed by 10400 strikes while maximum Call OI was seen at 10700 followed by 10600 strikes.

According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 10,520.37, followed by 10,456.03. If the index starts moving upward, key resistance levels to watch out are 10,643.67 and 10,702.63.

The Nifty Bank index closed at 24,960.7. The important Pivot level, which will act as crucial support for the index, is placed at 24,589.8, followed by 24,218.9.

On the upside, key resistance levels are placed at 25,207.9, followed by 25,455.1.

The Nifty ended Monday 0.46 percent higher at 10,528.35. Disappointing opening, amid negative global cues, followed by spectacular recovery from day’s low of around 10,397 before ending the session above the 10,500 mark indicates continuation of the uptrend.

A bullish Marubozu candle on daily chart despite negative global cues clearly articulates the intrinsic strength of the current uptrend, which is likely to continue further towards 10,570. Since this level is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of Nifty's entire downfall from its all-time high to its recent low around 9,950 levels may act as immediate critical resistance.

On the Nifty hourly chart, it recovered from its 50 EMA and closed on a positive note. Challenging the upside resistance placed around 10,570 is highly likely.

Nifty patterns on multiple timeframes show recovery from the day’s low followed by an ending with a bullish Marubozu candle. This is a sign of renewed strength. An intra-day dip towards 10,510 might be a decent opportunity to reposition your buy trades for the next leg of upmove towards 10,570.

On Monday, the Bank Nifty ended 0.48 percent higher at 25,320.85. The candle pattern suggests it is heading towards its upside resistance placed around 25,400 and 25,550. The latter is pivotal support.

Based on a thorough technical study, Stewart & Mackertich Wealth Management recommends Asian Paints. The stock can deliver up to 5% return in the short-term:

Asian Paints | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,230 | Stop loss: Rs 1,140 | Return: 5%

The stock ended the session with a downward trendline breakout around Rs 1,170 levels. Steeply rising RSI and ADX recovering to above 20 is an indication of a strengthening uptrend. 13-30 EMA bullish crossover on the daily chart makes the bull case even stronger. We recommend Asian Paints as a buy on dips with a short-term upside target of Rs 1,230 per share.

Benchmarks closed higher on Thursday, breaking a six-day losing streak as Asian equities rose on hopes that US President Donald Trump’s plan to introduce hefty tariffs on steel and aluminium imports could exclude certain key partner countries. However, the market breadth remained in favour of declines. About three shares declined for every two shares rising on the BSE.

Among sectoral indices, the Nifty PSU Bank index rose over 2 percent higher lead by a rise in shares of India, Bank of Baroda and Syndicate Bank.

Technical Outlook

Nifty

The Nifty witnessed a volatile trading session on Thursday. It opened with positive note but failed to hold its opening gains and corrected towards 10,146 levels i.e. around its major moving average of 200 SMA. However, it recovered from day's low and closed with gains of 88.45 points.

The index has formed 'Hammer' candlestick pattern indicating a short term reversal. Furthermore, on hourly scale, oscillators like RSI & MACD has given positive crossover which is a bullish sign.

Nifty Bank

The index has formed a kind of 'Hammer' candlestick pattern around 78.6 percent Retracement level on daily scale. It recovered from day's low of 24,048 marks and closed with gains of 343.55 points. It is heading towards 24,770 levels i.e. 200 SMA which might work as strong hurdle zone.

Nifty Bank managed to close above lower band of Bollinger Band (20, 2) indicating bounce back from current level which cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, RSI (14) is on verge of positive crossover.

Below are the 5 stocks which can be good trades today with up to 3 % return potential

Sense and sanity appears to have reached global markets after the mayhem witnessed in preceding two weeks in which developed markets like Dow, DAX, CAC and FTSE lost between 9 – 12 % from their recent highs whereas emerging markets from BRIC space slipped between 7-10 percent barring China which took a knock of 14 percent.

However, current week witnessed a decent recovery in Global markets with Dow recouping almost 50 percent of its losses from recent lows. Indian market which took a hit of 8 percent from the highs of 11,171 – 10,276 appears to be bogged down by domestic factors.

Technically speaking, the recent correction brought down Nifty50 to critical support levels from where markets bounced back in the past. Hence, once more clarity emerges from the tainted banking space markets should stabilize and make an attempt for a sustainable pullback move.

The fact that market has not seen follow through sell off post ‘PNB scandal’ is clearly suggesting that bulls are more interested in holding on to their bets rather than throwing in the towel.

This kind of price action is clearly suggesting a short-term bottom in place around a recent low of 10,276 levels. As the market has moved in a range bound manner in the current week between 10,637 – 10,398, traders should focus for breach of these levels and the move outside this range can be swift in the direction of the breakout.

In the unfortunate event of the breakdown below 10,398 then worst case target looks like a test of 200-day moving average whose value is placed around 10070 levels whereas a close above 10,600 levels shall result in a sustainable pull back move with a target of 10,900.

IT and Pharma indices appear to be stabilizing. The main culprit PSU Bank index is trading inside the jumbo gap of 3400-3113 levels registered on 25th of last October in response to bank recapitalization scheme.

Once this gap gets filled on the charts, technically, a relief rally can’t be ruled out in the index which should bring stability to the broader markets.

Short-term outlook on Nifty50:

After hitting a panic bottom of 10276, Nifty50 is stuck up in a narrow range of 10,636-10,398 mostly due to domestic factors whereas Global markets witnessed decent rallies.

Indices like Brazilian Bovespa, Russian RTSi erased around 60 percent of their losses whereas Dow recouped around 50 percent of its recent losses.

Hence, once these domestic concerns are addressed to the satisfaction of the market even Indian indices should take part in the global rally.

Technically speaking to retain positive stance Nifty50 need to sustain above 10,398 levels on closing basis below which selling shall get accelerated whereas a close above 10,600 shall be considered as an initial sign of strength.

However, investors can remain focused on few stock specific opportunities irrespective of market direction.

Here are three trading ideas for the coming week which could give up to 8% return:

ACC: BUY | Target: Rs 1720 | Stop Loss: Rs 1611 | Return 4%

The way this counter recovered post quarterly result is suggesting that a major bottom is in place at the recent low of Rs 1568 levels.

After seeing a huge up move in a single session from the lows of Rs 1568 – 1707, it slipped into a corrective consolidation mode for 4 sessions.

It appears to have resumed its uptrend on Friday and should ideally head to test its 200-day moving average whose value is placed at Rs 1720 levels. A positional trader is advised to buy into this counter for a target of Rs 1720 with a stop below Rs 1611 on a closing basis.

HCL Technologies: BUY | Target: Rs 1015 | Stop Loss: Rs 920| Return 8%

After retracing 50 percent of its last leg of the rally from the lows of Rs 824 – 1040, this counter appears to be in a consolidation mode for last 7 sessions.

Interestingly, inside the consolidation phase, it created 50 point range between Rs 922 – 970 levels. Hence, once it manages to register a breakout this counter should witness a move towards Rs 1020 kind of levels.

In anticipation of such a breakout, positional traders should go long for a target of Rs 1015 with a stop below Rs 920 on a closing basis.

Asian Paints: BUY | Target: Rs 1180 | Stop Loss: Rs 1117 | Return 3%

In a falling market, this counter closed in a positive zone suggesting that it has bottomed out at a recent low of 1100. After a brief correction, the stocks witnessed a small rally from Rs 1100 to 1150.

Hence, if this counter started a fresh leg of up move then ideally it should head towards Rs 1180 kind of levels. Traders are advised to go long in this counter for the target of Rs 1180 and a stop of Rs 1117.

Geojit Financial Services' research report on Asian Paints

In Q3FY18, revenue grew by 10.6% YoY to Rs 4,267cr (below estimate) on account of subdued volume growth of 6.5%. Management stated that extended monsoon in southern part coupled with split in festival demand between Q2 & Q3 impacted the topline growth. In the International operations, Units in Nepal, Bangladesh, Oman and Bahrain continue to stay on the growth trajectory.

Outlook

Strong presence in decorative paint and cost control initiatives to contain pressure on inflating raw material price will improve margins and profitability. We roll over our valuation to FY20E EPS and upgrade our rating to Buy with a target price of Rs 1,283, based on a P/E of 42x FY20E earnings.

ICICI Direct's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints (APL) witnessed 10.5% growth in net sales to Rs 4260.5 crore (I-direct estimate - Rs 4460.4 crore) mainly led by a mix of volume growth and price hikes. We believe volume growth has been to the tune of 5% during the quarter. Decorative paints demand remained muted for the company due to lower demand in south India that was impacted by extended monsoons and continued GST related disruptive environment, in general Operating margin improved 120 bps to 20.9% (I-direct estimate: 19.0%) due to 6.4% decline in overhead expenses as investment in renewable energy resulted in savings in power cost. Simultaneously, lower marketing expenses have also helped in margin expansion. We believe input tax credits in many overhead expenses also resulted in margin expansion Led by higher operating profit and 19.8% growth in other income, net profit increased 16.1% YoY to Rs 567.2 crore (vs. I-direct estimate: ~Rs 545.5 crore).

Outlook

We expect the company to record sales CAGR of 13.4% in FY17-20E led by estimated volume CAGR of 9.3%. We believe that being a market leader in the decorative paint segment, any price hike in raw material would be easily passed on to its customers. The company would maintain EBITDA margin at ~18% despite higher raw material prices. As a result, PAT is likely to record a CAGR of 13.8% for FY17-20E. Also, high cash on books could lead to an increase in dividend payout & improvement in RoEs. The stock is discounting all near term positives at the CMP. Hence we maintain HOLD recommendation with a target price of Rs 1240/share.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian Paints

APNT has given cautiously optimistic outlook on demand as economy post GST implementation has started stabilising. Demand scenario looks encouraging as low penetration in small towns/rural India and GOI focus on affordable housing boosts demand for decorative paints in coming years. Near term margin pressure looks likely as input costs linked to crude and Tio2 have firmed up. We expect APNT to outperform Kansai Nerolac (30% outperformance over APNT in 12 months) as it has just 5% contribution from Auto and Industrial paints (lower pricing power) than ~40% for Kansai.

Outlook

We expect premium valuations to sustain and retain “Accumulate” with target price of Rs1,278 (41xDec18 EPS).

The research house has set a target price at Rs Rs 1,300, implying a 14.4 percent potential upside from Monday's closing levels. Current valuations limit potential for re-rating, it said.

Volume-led growth will continue; and pricing and mix will aid topline, it feels.

Margin pressure is largely behind, said Jefferies which expects modest margin expansion. Capex plans will keep return on capital employed subdued until FY19, he believes.

The research house expects volume/revenue/EPS to grow at a CAGR of 11/15/17 percent over FY18-20.

Jefferies' bull case target price for the stock is at Rs 1,700; in which case, it expects volume/revenue/EPS to grow at a CAGR of 13/18/22 percent over FY18-20.",141,0.6951180795828501

The market strength is always judged on corrections. Continuing the recent tendency of opening higher and letting go sharply in the latter half, Nifty made a low of 10,267.

However, BankNifty had other ideas in mind, providing respite to benchmark index after staging an upmove of 100 points, and regaining control above the recent breakout level of 25,200. As a result, Nifty managed a close above 10,300 level.

Point of confluence around 10,285 came into play in Thursday’s trade and caused a pause following two days of decline.

Support of 180 degrees move from the peak of 10,490 and the second line of defence as per the gann rule of 8 placed around 10,290 (from the base of the rally that began on 28th September) provided some respite.

Moreover, during the intraday decline, Nifty took support near its 21-days EMA which has been acting as a savior point since early October.

Forming a third consecutive lower high and lower low pattern, Nifty settled the session in positive territory. It also implies that selling pressure could intensify only if Nifty fails to sustain above 10,250.

Here is a list of three stocks which could give up to 7% return in the short term:

Asian Paints: BUY| Target Rs1275| Stop Loss Rs1160| Return 7%

The point of polarity around Rs1,120 came to the rescue of Asian Paints. The stock had been on a downward curve after making a peak of Rs1,234 in last week of October 2017, after it failed to sustain above the gann number of 1225.

However, the corrective move came to an end after the stock yet again found respite around the horizontal line placed near the point of polarity. Since July 2017, on multiple occasions the stock has bounced back, paying credence to the important support line.

Up trending stocks tend to find support at declines and also tend to recover sharply from such corrective movement.

Based on above rationale, we expect the stock to build on last two days week’s recovery. Traders can buy Asian Paints above Rs1,190 with a stop loss of Rs1,160 and a target of Rs1,275.

Indiabulls Housing Finance: BUY| Target Rs1310| Stop Loss Rs1200| Return 6%

Multiple tops are placed around Rs1,370 which led to a reversal as the stock made a low of Rs1,170 before forming a Hammer pattern on the candlestick chart.

It is a trend reversal pattern and is accompanied by a positive divergence in the RSI oscillator from the oversold terrain. A Hammer pattern on the daily chart, suggests that recent selling pressure has exhausted and the stock will resume a new trend.

With the recovery in Thursday’s trade, the stock yet again regained control above its 21-weekly moving average. As long this support is intact, traders should use declines for buying opportunities.

The confluence of gann numbers between the range of 1210-1225 has contributed to recent reversal. Based on above observations, we recommend a buy on Indiabulls Housing Finance above Rs1,235 with a stop loss of Rs1,200 and a target of Rs1,310.

Britannia Industries: BUY| Target Rs4980| Stop Loss Rs4710| Return 5%

It is currently going through a phase of consolidation at the top of its rally. It is showing characteristics of a stock which is in a strong uptrend. It is moving higher along with the support of its 13-WEMA since January 2017, wherein every pullback towards this critical moving average has resulted in buying opportunity.

Since the last three weeks, the sideways consolidation at the top of its trend can be termed as bullish consolidation. The outcome of such sideways movement is dealt positively during an uptrend.

Moreover, it continues to trade above the gann number of 441(0). A move above Rs4,850 would result in a shift in the orbit on the upside and would eventually confirm a breakout from the bullish consolidation pattern.

Based on above parameters, we recommend traders to buy on Britannia Industries between Rs4,750-4,770 with a stop loss of Rs4,710 and a target of Rs4,980.

ICICI Direct's research report on Asian Paints

APL is the industry leader in the decorative paint segment with 53% market share and a dealer network of over 40,000 across India. It derives 89% of its topline from the decorative segment while the rest comes from the industrial segment. We believe paint companies will be key beneficiaries of the government’s key reforms like implementation of GST and pay hike. While the Seventh Pay Commission has boosted the disposable income of 1.4 crore government employees, GST would reduce tax arbitrage for the unorganised segment (25-30% of total industry).

Outlook

As a result, PAT is likely to record a CAGR of 12% for FY17-19E. Also, high cash on the books could lead to an increase in dividend payout and improvement in RoEs. We believe, at the CMP, the stock is discounting all near term positives with earnings multiple of 52x and 44x FY18E and FY19E, respectively. We maintain our HOLD recommendation on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 1241 per share.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian Paints

APNT reported high single‐digit volume growth in domestic decorative business in Q2FY18 as post GST recovery and festival demand was visible only from September 2017. Gross margins in Q2 declined by 310bps YoY due to carry‐over input cost inventory till August end, despite some softening in Q2. We expect H2FY18 growth to accelerate, given low base due to demonetisation in Q3FY17 and expected pickup in demand. We expect mid‐teens volume growth in the decorative paints for the coming 5‐10 years led by rising consumerism, reduced painting cycles and increased application in small towns and rural India.

Outlook

We expect premium valuations to sustain and retain “Accumulate” with target price of Rs1,239 (Rs1200 earlier). We expect returns to be back‐ended, given all‐time high valuations.

Edelweiss' research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints’ (APL) Q2FY18 consolidated sales (up 15% YoY) came slightly ahead of estimates, while EBITDA (up 13.6% YoY) and adj. PAT (up 7.5% YoY) came in line with estimates. With continuing impact of GST within trade channel in July, decorative volumes grew ~8% YoY (in line with our estimates) though comparatively softer than Kansai Nerolac’s volume growth of 18% YoY and APL’s historical run-rate of >10%. With no price hikes in the quarter and sustained inflationary raw material scenario, gross margin plummeted by 308bps YoY to 41.3% (lowest in ~3 years). Anticipated volume recovery, price hikes, and government’s housing push lend growth and margin comfort. Maintain ‘BUY’ on dips.

Outlook

We expect APL to be key beneficiary of recovery in GDP, rising urbanisation and government’s housing push. Hence, we expect decorative volumes to recoup from H2FY18. As we raise FY19E EPS by 2.4%, our target price is pegged at INR1,273 (INR1,249 earlier), based on target multiple of 45x FY19E EPS. Maintain ‘BUY/SO’. At CMP, the stock trades at 43.2x FY19E EPS.

Asian Paints, one of the largest paint companies in India, is expected to report a 4.7 percent growth year-on-year in profit at Rs 518 crore for July-September quarter, against Rs 494.8 crore in corresponding quarter last fiscal.

Consolidated total income from operations may increase 10.5 percent to Rs 4,671 crore compared with Rs 4,232.5 crore year-on-year, according to average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Operating profit is seen rising 9.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 778 crore but margin may contract by 10 basis points to 16.7 percent in quarter ended September 2017.

Cost of goods sold may remain elevated also due to weaker rupee. Crude prices increased 13 percent YoY and 3 percent QoQ in Q2FY18.

Key thing to watch out for would be its domestic volume growth that is expected to be around 7-8 percent for the quarter, against 3 percent in Q1FY18 and 12 percent in Q2FY17.

Early Diwali & GST restocking may support revenue growth.

Analysts expect realisation growth at around 4-5 percent. The company had hiked products prices by around 5.5 percent since March 1.

Performance of Ess Ess and Sleek may start to improve post aberration seen in Q1FY18.

The Nifty opened at 9,832.70 and closed at 9,827.15 thus forming a 'Doji' pattern on Tuesday. It rose to its intraday high of 9,885.35 which made a long upper shadow and fell to an intraday low of 9,792.05 which made a long lower shadow.

It is a neutral pattern which suggests neither bulls nor bears were able to regain control on the D-Street but for bulls to take back charge, Nifty has to cross 9,850.

The Nifty closed below the 9,850-mark on Tuesday. According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 9,784.35, followed by 9,741.55. If the index starts to move higher, then key resistance levels to watch out are 9,877.65, followed by 9,928.15.

Nifty Bank closed 7 points higher at 24022.05 on Tuesday. Important Pivot level, which will act as crucial support for the index, is placed at 23927.0, followed by 23831.9. On the upside, key resistance level is 24132.3 followed by 24242.5.

According to Prakash Gaba of prakashgaba.com, the Nifty opened with bear gap and traded volatile to close in the red below the crucial 9850 mark and in the process generating an indecisive bar. I would now say that a slide to 9720 is a possibility and resistance exists at 9900. The crucial support for the Nifty is at 9720 and the resistance is at 9900-9969. Bank Nifty on the other hand has support at 23900 and resistance at 24300.

Rising US Shale production, low oil demand and high inventories have been a triple whammy for crude oil prices which are now trading below USD 45/barrel or some would say has entered the bear territory. Crude oil, also known as black gold made a high of USD 55.24 barrel and now made a low of USD 42.75 barrel, a fall of more than 22 percent in 2017.

“A decline of more than 20 percent from a most recent high is typically considered as a bear market. The last time crude hit a bear market was in August 2016. The ramp-up in US shale oil production raised concerns over the effectiveness of Opec’s supply cuts in balancing the oversupplied market,” D K Aggarwal, Chairman, and MD, SMC Investments and Advisors Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“The shale comeback is displayed by the unrelenting rise in the Baker Hughes rig count. The closely-watched metric has increased 22 weeks in a row -- the longest streak since 1987 when the data first started being collected,” he said.

It is expected that monthly U.S. oil production could hit a new record before the end of the year. As per International Energy Agency, U.S. will lead a surge in non-OPEC supply next year that will outpace growth in global demand.

But, India has nothing to complain about.

A fall in crude oil prices will help keep macros in check because it is still a major component of our net imports bill while on the other hand, it is good for equities because crude oil is used as a raw material by a lot of companies.

According to economists, a 10 percent reduction in crude oil prices could reduce Consumer Price Index-based inflation by around 20 basis points (bps) and bring about a 30 bps rise in gross domestic product (GDP) growth.

Most analysts expect crude oil prices to remain rangebound with upside capped at around USD 55 barrel and unlikely to fall below USD 40 to conclude that it is in a bear territory.

“We don’t expect crude oil prices to enter into a bear territory and expect rising demand to eventually drain out the global excess inventory,” Avishek Datta, of Prabhudas Lilladher, told Moneycontrol.

“Lower crude oil prices are beneficial to Indian companies as we import over 80 percent of our crude oil requirement. More specifically, lower crude oil prices help the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) as they don’t have to worry about the loss on subdidised products like LPG and kerosene,” he said.

We have collated a list of stocks recommended by different experts which are likely to benefit the most from fall in crude oil prices:

Analyst: Jayant Manglik - President - Retail Distribution, Religare Securities.

Sutlej Textiles

Synthetic fibres like polyester, viscose and acrylic are the key petroleum-based inputs (60 percent of total raw material cost consumed) for Sutlej Textiles, used in the manufacturing of synthetic yarn (55 percent of total revenues).

Thus, Sutlej is likely to be a key beneficiary of falling crude oil prices, which could result in a decline in the prices of these key inputs, though with some time lag. Led by demand revival and capacity expansion, we expect a meaningful turnaround in Sutlej’s Revenue and PAT growth over FY17-19E. Declining debt-equity and steady dividend payouts should provide comfort to the valuations.

Castrol India

Castrol India Ltd (CIL) is one of the leading automotive and industrial lubricant manufacturing and marketing companies in India. Lubricants are manufactured by blending base oils and additives, with base oil being the main component.

A sharp decline in the crude oil prices could result in lower base oil prices and help CIL improve its margins. “We estimate CIL’s Revenue and PAT to grow at a CAGR of 6 percent & 6.3 percent respectively over CY16-18E, led by new launches and sustained brand building efforts,” said Manglik.

Cash rich and debt-free status, superior return ratios and high and consistent dividend payouts justify the premium valuations.

Berger Paints

Berger Paints India Ltd. is the second largest decorative paint player in India with a market share of 19 percent. The company has a strong distribution network comprising of 75 stock points and over 15,000 paint retailers.

Titanium Dioxide and crude derivative products form 50 percent of the raw material cost of Berger Paints. With crude oil prices have softened considerably over the past few weeks, we estimate this will aid EBITDA margin improvement by 50-100 bps, considering the company will pass on the only partial benefit of lower crude prices to end consumers.

“We are positive on the Paint sector and like Berger Paints, in particular, considering the company’s strong product folio and brand recall,” said Manglik.

Analyst: A.K.Prabhakar, Head -Research at IDBI Capital

InterGlobe Aviation

INDIGO has a market share of 41.3 percent in the Indian passenger market and load factor stood at 91.1 percent and now lower crude prices can help in higher load factor and margin expansion.

Nilkamal

Nilkamal (NILK) has a unique business model with pan-India presence and 1,500 distributors, 20,000 retailers, 60 warehouses and 42 branches. It dominates the material handling (market share of 45-50 percent) and moulded furniture markets (market share of 35-37 percent) with more than 2,000 products.

With falling crude oil price, the raw material cost for the company is expected to come down, which would provide impetus to its EBITDA margin. Overall, the company reported a volume growth of 8 percent during FY17 which we expect to increase to 10-11 percent during FY18/FY19 along with flattish realization growth.

With new product development and strong growth in domestic consumption, we expect its Revenue/EBITDA/PAT to grow at a CAGR of 10.4/11.2/13 percent during FY17-FY19E. We have a positive view on the stock.

Finolex Industries

Finolex Industries Ltd is the largest manufacturer of PVC pipes & fittings and second largest PVC resin manufacturer. They have a capacity of nearly 2.9LMT of PVC pipe & fitting. Profit contribution from PVC resin and pipe business is almost 55:45.

We expect as crude oil price is falling, the company’s raw material cost would come down which would aid to its margins. The company expects its PVC pipes & fitting business along with PVC resin business to see a double-digit growth over the next few years.

The company is investing Rs3 bn during FY17-19E to add 120KT of capacity. “We expect its Revenue/EBITDA/PAT to grow at a CAGR of 16 percent/17.4 percent/19.6 percent during FY17-FY19E. We keep BUY rating on the stock,” said Prabhakar.

Analyst: D K Aggarwal, Chairman, and MD, SMC Investments and Advisors Ltd

JK Tyre & Industries

The company has good fundamentals and management is focusing towards the reduction of its debts. It has a first-mover advantage in introducing cutting edge technology. Its plants are world benchmarks in water consumption with zero waste, 36 percent of its energy consumed is renewable.

It is a high-recall and trusted brand since last four decades. The company is enhancing its segment in the market by bringing equal products and the equal pricing and with the equal sales efforts with a lifetime warranty against any manufacturing defect to meet the Chinese competition.

Kansai Nerolac

Kansai Nerolac is the leader in the Industrial Coatings market space and it continues to increase its market share in this space. It has extended its close interaction with customers to the areas of Performance coatings which has helped it increase its market share.

The company now serves a vast array of OEM industries with a variety of products. The continued technology focus from the parent Kansai Paint Co. Ltd. (which holds 69.27 percent stake in the company), Japan has helped bring the latest technology products.

Based on the excellent track record and new technology offerings, Multiple New OEM Business have been awarded for future business prospects.

Analyst: Nitasha Shankar, Sr. Vice President and Head of Research, YES Securities (I) Ltd.

Reliance Industries

The core business will continue to see an improvement in profitability. The company’s management expects GRMs (Gross Refining Margins) to improve from current levels as there would be limited net refining capacity addition of 0.8Mbpd against an incremental demand growth of 1.3Mbpd in 2017.

While in Petchem, demand is expected to rise by 4 percent compared to a 3 percent increase in supply. This should help in supporting higher rates as well as higher product margins.

At the same time, the capex intensity that we have seen till now is expected to ease off from this year onwards. At the same time as the company starts to monetize investments made till now (like RJIO), cash flows are set to improve hereon.

Analyst: Rakesh Tarway, Head of Research, Reliance Securities

UltraTech Cement, Shree Cement, ACC, JK Cement, Mangalam Cement:

Most of the cement companies have enhanced their fuel mix in favour of petcoke and currently using over 80 percent of petcoke as fuel. Petcoke prices move in tandem with crude prices. Hence, a fall in crude price is beneficial for all cement companies.

Notably, a drop of 5 percent in petcoke prices may result in incremental EBITDA/tonne of Rs40-50. UltraTech, Shree Cement, ACC, J.K. Cement, Mangalam Cement, etc. would be key benefitted most.

CEAT & MRF

As rubber accounts for 70 percent of total opex for the tyre industry, a meaningful fall in crude price will aid tyre companies in margin expansion.

There is a healthy correlation between crude price and rubber prices as they move parallel with each other. CEAT and MRF would be major gainer from fall in crude prices.

Asian Paints

For paint companies, the fall in crude oil prices will be beneficial as crude oil derivatives is used as inputs for paints.

Given that the entire benefit is unlikely to be passed on to the end consumer, there will be an expansion in margins. Asian Paints and Berger Paints should be major beneficiaries.

The market started the week with a strong bullish movement and witnessed a gap up opening that remained intact throughout the entire session.

The 20-DMA is proving a strong support level for the Nifty while during Monday’ session relative strength index (RSI) has also generated fresh buying signals along with increasing volumes.

The market ended at a high of six days and attracting new buyers into the market. Levels of 9,550 will remain a very strong support to the downside where only a close below could bring more selling pressure.

A trend reversal can be expected thereafter but it seems that bulls are taking gradual control of the market here. The level of 9,700-9,720 will be the immediate resistance above which uptrend would confirm and the market will remain upside for over short to medium term.

Top five stocks to buy for intraday trade which can give up to 3% return:

Vedanta: BUY| Target Rs250| Stop Loss Rs237| Return 3%

The 20-DMA has proven a strong support level for the stock in the recent few sessions along with that the counter managed to close well above 50-DMA in Monday’s session. The bullish candle on the daily chart and crossover in RSI and MACD are supporting more upside is highly likely for the stock.

Asian Paints: BUY| Target Rs1170| Stop Loss Rs1138| Return 1%

The chart has gained momentum during the intraday session on Monday and closed with a positive candle on the daily chart.

Prices are well supported by 20-DMA along with rising RSI and MACD which also hints bulls to remain intact and more upside can be expected from the present levels.

Tata Steel: BUY| Target Rs538| Stop Loss Rs510| Return 3%

The stock has witnessed gap up opening on Monday’s trading session attracting more buyers and maintained its uptrend throughout the session.

A fresh upside breakout has seen on the daily charts which is likely to remain intact over short to medium term.

Power Grid: BUY| Target Rs218| Stop Loss Rs209.50| Return 2.8%

The stock has gained momentum during the intraday session and reached to its resistance level which is likely to give a breakout on the higher side as most of the momentum indicators are in favor of northwards move to remain intact.

The daily chart is making an inverted head and shoulder kind of a situation at present which is a bullish sign and a cross above neckline near Rs213.50 would confirm its formation and more upside can be expected.

Geojit Financial Services recommends the following stocks:

Havells India Ltd.

Rating: Reduce

Havells India (HAVL) is a leading player in electrical consumer goods in India.

Q4FY17 revenue growth was healthy at 17 percent YoY; however, PAT growth was limited to 7 percent YoY. EBITDA margin declined by 180 bps YoY to 13.4 percent due to higher incentives paid to dealers and delay in price hikes. Given the near-term impact on margins, we lower our FY18E earnings estimates by 3.8 percent. We factor 17 percent CAGR earnings over FY17-19E. We value HAVL at P/E of 35x (33x earlier) on FY19E and Lloyd consumer business at Rs 26 to arrive at SOTP target price of Rs 485, while downgrade to reduce.

Asian Paints Ltd

Rating: Hold

Asian Paints (APNT) is the market leader in the Indian paint manufacturing industry with a market share of about 53 percent.

Q4FY17 sales grew by 8.9 percent YoY led by low double-digit volume growth & a price hike of 3 percent in March 2017. While EBITDA margin declined by 108bps YoY due to increase in crude, TIO2 prices & other expenses. Pickup in rural demand is reducing the impact of demonetisation, while the forecast of normal monsoon & implementation of GST will give ample impetus to the paint industry. Due to rich valuation & recent outperformance in stock price we maintain our hold rating by valuing at a P/E of 40x FY19E EPS.

Apollo Tyres Ltd.

Rating: BUY

Apollo Tyres (ATL) has been in the business of manufacturing and selling tyres since its inception in 1972, it commands a dominant market share of 25 percent in the truck tyre segment.

Q4FY17, consolidated sales grew by 10.3 percent YoY owing to healthy volumes growth. India/Europe business is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14-17 percent over FY17-19E led by enhanced capacities across both the geographies. However, EBITDA margin declined 534bps YoY to 11.1 percent on account of higher natural rubber prices. Given ATL’s dominant position in TBR segment coupled with robust brand equity, improving pricing environment in the sector with declining threat of Chinese imports, we expect revenue/PAT to grow at a CAGR of ~16-17 percent over FY17-19E.",372,0.21262338012456894

ICICI Direct's research report on Asian Paints

Post demonetisation, Asian Paints (APL) recorded strong volume growth of 11% YoY in Q4FY17 supported by a recovery in demand from tier II and tier III cities. However, the realisation remains muted due to a change in the product mix and some trade discounts in January.

Outlook

We believe at the CMP the stock is discounting all near term positive with earning multiple of 48x and 41x FY18E and FY19E, respectively. We value the stock at 43x FY19E earnings and revise our target price to Rs 1204 per share.

Edelweiss' research report on Asian Paints

APL’s standalone sales grew 9.4% YoY (paint sales jumped 10.4% YoY from 0.6% YoY in Q3FY17), though gross and EBITDA margins dipped 160bps and 112bps YoY, respectively. While the auto JV (PPG-AP) improved led by auto OEM and general industrial business segments, industrial JV (AP-PPG) was driven by liquid paints, road marking paints and powder coatings.

Outlook

We believe, APL will be key beneficiary of potential recovery in GDP, rising urbanisation and government’s housing push. Hence, in our view, decorative volumes will pick up from FY18. The stock is trading at 38.6x FY19E EPS. We maintain ‘BUY /SO’ with target price of INR 1,269.

The stock fell over 3 percent intraday on Friday.

The paints maker posted 10 percent rise in Q4 net profit at Rs 479.6 crore against Rs 435.5 crore during the corresponding quarter last year. Its revenue rose 8.9 percent at Rs 4,416.2 crore against Rs 4,054 crore year on year.

Brokerage houses, however, were mixed on the stock and did not have much of positive views.

Here’s what three top brokerages are talking about the stock.Brokerage: Macquarie | Rating: Neutral

The brokerage house observed that a recovery in volumes was evident in the company’s March quarter performance.

“Good forecasts of monsoon, recovery in demand post demonetisation and subdued interest rate environment should help volume inch up from 9 percent in FY17 to 15 percent in FY18,” it said in a report.

Having said that, it said that the peak margins were behind and price hikes offset rise in input costs.

“We continue to maintain our thesis that margins peaked out in 1Q FY17…two successive price increases of 3% (in March) and 2.7% (in May) could help the company partly offset the rising raw material prices,” the report added.

Brokerage: Goldman

Goldman stated that Asian Paints is betting on demand for affordable housing, which will benefit the company when a customer decides to re-paint.

On the pricing front, it said that the company had undertaken two price hikes. The action would continue to remain a function of raw material costs, but is hesitant on increasing price by more than 4 percent at once.

Furthermore, the management does not expect to maintain gross margins at current levels as it expects raw material prices to rise further. However, the appreciating rupee could partly offset the margin pressure.

Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Sell | Target: Rs 970

CLSA highlighted a key positive on Asian Paints, which regained growth momentum post demonetisation in decorative segment. “Rising input prices impact expectedly showed up on margins but margin contraction was ahead of our forecast,” it said in a report.

Despite price hikes, it forecasts a slight margin drop in FY18. On the stock, it believe that te valuation is expensive.",367,0.3145459443330765

The Art Stations project is an endeavour by St+art India Foundation and Asian Paints to transform transit spaces into walk in galleries for the public. With the gracious support of DMRC, along with the Singapore High Commission and the Singapore Tourism Board, the Arjan Garh Metro station will transform into a work of art by two well renowned Singaporean artists Sam lo and Soph O. Along with Indian artist Nilesh and Mexican artist Senkoe, the project explores the vibrant Indian flora and fauna through the interpretation of the artists. The project aims to provide everyday hundreds of commuters with a sense of visual relief and become a catalyst for conversations, ideas and cultural exchanges.Arty makeover of Delhi metro stations: The conceptAlong with DMRC as St+art’s implementation partner, the project is an opportunity to offer road and metro commuters of Delhi, a cultural experience through murals in the most democratic and accessible way. Delhi Metro has been a pride for the capital since its inception. With a seamless flow of ideas, Delhi’s metro stations would soon be an example of art & cultural harmony worth reckoning the world over.Placed on the Mehrauli highway, Arjan Garh metro station is an important connecting bridge between South Delhi and Gurugram. The curatorial approach brings together these artists with their distinctive styles to convey their interpretation of the local flora and fauna of Delhi.New Delhi was carved out of green land and forested areas which is now faced with the prospect of dwindling greenery and growing cityscape of building upon building. To confront this visual and offer a refreshing change, the artists are invited to depict a celebration of nature.Two Singaporean artists will be painting the Arjan Garh metro stations exterior facades with drawings of the Kingfisher and Myna birds, which are native to both India and Singapore. Stimulated by their observations while travelling within the city, they picked on the intriguing sights of various birds seen flying or squatting everywhere from tree branches to traffic signs. They will be teaming up with Mexican artist Senkoe and Indian artist Nilesh, making it a true blend of ideas and cultures. These murals will be created on the steps that take the commuters from the ground to the platform and vice versa, hence completing the visual thread from platform to the outside of the station.With all their works completed, the Art Station will be one that provides a visual stimulus for the daily commuters. An Indo-Singapore collaboration of this kind will also bring out the deep significance of a cultural exchange between the two countries and the ability of art to unite hearts.About the artistsTwo Singaporean artists, SKL0 and Soph O, who usually work as individual artists, will be coming together in a special collaboration to paint the facades of the metro station.SKL0 is an artist currently based in Singapore whose work is heavily inspired by daily observations and research on the socio-political climate which she executes through visual commentary comprising of text and imagery.Soph O is a Singaporean visual artist who collects and draws imagery that borders between the mundane and extraordinary. Her practice revolves around the notion of repetition, reiteration and recurrence through drawing, painting, digital illustration, installation and mural.Senkoe from Mexico City draws his inspiration from nature and likes to work on walls situated in contexts of wide avenues and textured or smooth surfaces. He is intrigued by aged and cracked walls that show traces of the passage of time. In the Arjan Garh St+art project, Senkoe, will also engage in the dialogue of birds with his own brilliant take on the species, flying in and out of each other, propped up against a background of Delhi’s historic architecture.Nilesh is an artist from Pune whose art is very responsive to the historical and personal nature of the facade or structure he is working with. In his personal and distinctive style, Nilesh narrates the indigenous identity of spaces and the personal stories of the people, to the public.A COLORFUL COLLABORATIONSt+art India hopes to continually reinforce and nurture a network between cultural organisations and foundations operating in the same field, and under the same values of preserving, contemporising and spreading Indian culture along with cultivating cultural exchanges in an open, accessible way for the public. This time, the Arjan Garh Metro Station will come to life due to a special collaborative approach between St+art India Foundation, DMRC, Asian Paints, Singapore High Commission, Singapore Tourism Board and Sanskriti Foundation.The Singapore High Commission is passionate about sharing Singaporean art and culture in India and St+art India Foundation believes in sharing a mutual vision of providing a public voice to the cultural spirits of various artists from different parts of the world.Mr Lim Thuan Kuan, High Commissioner of Singapore to India, “As vibrant, ever growing cities, Delhi and Singapore face similar challenges of balancing between preserving nature and urbanisation. Singapore has adopted the concept of a ‘City in a Garden’ as we strive to introduce more greenery into our urban landscape. The Arjan Garh Metro Station project is exciting as it brings together Singapore and Indian artists to explore this theme from their unique artistic and cultural perspectives. We hope the completed work will bring more colour and life to the surrounding neighbourhoods!”Asian Paints shares St+art India Foundation’s vision of making art accessible to everyone and believes in the power of transforming public spaces through street art. Taking the association with St+Art and DMRC to the next level, Mr. Amit Syngle, President – Sales, Marketing & Technology, Asian Paints said, “Indian cities are known for their rich history and heritage. Through Asian Paint’s and St+Art Foundation’s association we tend to reinvent public spaces by means of art and culture. Public art is for everyone to see and acknowledge. It’s wonderful to see how aesthetically it adds significance to our cities and creates uniqueness to our communities. It would be a great delight to help relieve people’s stress during their local travel through this awe-inspiring beautiful artwork. And that is what we intend to do through this DMRC project.”Through this combined effort, the institutes bring together Singaporean and Indian artists to create a rich dialogue between the different expressions and narrative styles of the two countries.Stressing upon the power of art, Ms. Giulia Ambrogi - Co-Founder & Curator, St+art India Foundation expressed, “Four different artists, four different styles, yet a common research on the topic of the nature, one of the favourite subjects of their own practice. This individual approach became here a common venture to create an immersive imagery and transform inside out the concrete surfaces of the Arjan Garh metro station into an archive of local flora and fauna. With this second St+art station, we hope to create a diffused museum for the city.”Speaking about the project, Mr. Akshat Nauriyal, Co-Founder & Content Director, St+art India Foundation, shared, “Transit spaces in big cities like Delhi stand as modern structures but are also very inert and non-interactive for the people who use them the most. Through the ‘Art Stations’ project, we hope to add a bit of vibrance in everyday commuters’ lives. Also, since the footfall in these spaces is so high, the project will truly bring art to the masses.”Anuj Dayal, Spokesperson on DMRC, emphasised the role art is playing in enhancing a commuter’s experience, “The Delhi Metro utilises its spaces for the promotion of art, culture and heritage. Apart from having a museum inside the Patel Chowk station, DMRC has installed decorative panels, art works at various stations such as Mandi House, Janpath, ITO, Udyog Bhawan, INA, Jor Bagh, Green Park etc. For this unique initiative at Arjan Garh Metro Station, Delhi Metro has tied up with St+art India, which is a non-profit organisation working for the promotion of street art. The Govindpuri Metro station on the violet line (ITO-Faridabad) was also given a new look with various artistic illustrations in tie up with the same organisation.”Sanskriti FoundationEstablished in 1979, Sanskriti Foundation is dedicated to promoting, preserving and presenting the Indian traditional arts and culture through various programmes, such as residency of artists, hosting Indian and International artists thanks to which deep cultural exchanges can take place.

The Sajjan Jindal family is investing Rs 1,000 crore to build two factories to foray into the Asian Paints-dominated paints segment and is targeting an April 2018 launch, a senior official has said.

""We are planning to launch in April of next year. We have one factory coming up in Vijaynagar in Karnataka and one industrial line coming up in Vasind in Maharashtra,"" his son Parth Jindal, who is looking after the business, said.

He said JSW Paints is a fully family-owned entity and the two plants are coming up at an investment of Rs 1,000 crore, which will be funded through both debt and equity.

Asian Paints is gaining market share every year in the paints segment and the family, which already runs JSW Steel and JSW Cement, looks at this as a lucrative business because of the complementarity, he said.

""The paint industry is growing at 15 per cent every year. Asian Paints is gaining market share every year. Its an industry we are very excited about, We have the cement and steel distribution already in place. We have the opportunity to become the one stop solution where we can offer cement, steel and paint to consumer,"" he told reporters recently.

It will be both a business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C), he said, adding it will be doing a decorative unit in Vijaynagar, while the Vasind unit will focus on industrial segment.

Jindal said the company has started work on both the factories and expects them to be ready by early 2018, and it will be hitting the market in April or May, after testing the products.

At present, Asian Paints' capacity is 1 million kilolitres per annum while the total market is 2.5 million KLPA, Jindal said, adding JSW Paints is looking to hit 1 million KLPA by 2025.

Initially the focus will be on the southern and the western markets and the company is also looking at installing capacity in West Bengal in the next few years, he said.

""We are very excited by the potential of the business and we understand the retail business a little bit because of cement. I think there is huge opportunity for us, a new entrant to do well,"" he said.",381,0.9999340971310934

The rupee retreated from the lows of Rs 68/USD last seen in the year 2016 to claim the tag of Asia’s third-best performing currency in the first three months of the year 2017.

The Indian rupee appreciated more than 3 percent against US Dollar so far in the year to Rs 65.45/USD which was closer to a 17-month high of 65.36, a level which was last seen on October 30, 2015.

Korean Won appreciated more than 7 per cent against the dollar followed by Taiwan Dollar and Japanese Yen which appreciated by 5 per cent each.

The appreciation of the rupee is likely to continue in near term as the rupee is reasonably well placed on inflation differential, current account deficit, and foreign direct investment (FDI) flow.

“There does not seem to be any danger of FII outflow, if anything, we could see some inflows as the DM to EM reversal gathers strength. On the downside, therefore, the INR is unlikely to depreciate below 70 to the USD,” Lalit Nambiar, EVP & Fund Manager (Equities), Head – Research, UTI Mutual Fund told Moneycontrol.com.

On the political front, BJP-led government coming in power with a sweeping victory in country’s largest state Uttar Pradesh has provided strength to rupee on the back of stable government along with the hope of more bold reforms coming in future, suggest experts.

The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) neutral stance on policy rates has signalled rupee to trade higher against the dollar. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, dipped below the 100 level for the first time since Feb. 7 on Wednesday.

After strong GDP data and stable December quarter earnings from India Inc., foreign institutional investors (FII) who had turned net seller in the Indian debt as well as equity markets post demonetisation have now become net buyers, suggest experts.

However, further appreciation looks unlikely. Almost 72 per cent of the respondents polled by Moneycontrol.com earlier in the month said that the rupee is likely to hover in the range of Rs 64-67/USD by December 2017 while 17 per cent are of the view that it would go below 64 and the rest feels that it would depreciate beyond Rs 67/USD.

“The rupee appreciation will bring pain for the export-oriented sectors like information technology, pharma, reality, and Tourism. However, somebody loss is somebody gains, so import oriented sectors like power and metal sectors are in the list of beneficiary sectors from rupee appreciation,” Abnish Kumar Sudhanshu, Director & Research Head, Amrapali Aadya Trading & Investments told Moneycontrol.com.

“Companies having a large number of borrowings in dollars are likely to be benefitted like power companies. We advise investors to look to enter in Tata Power, Tata Steel, Hindalco, Gitanjali Gems, and Titan Company,” he said.

Oil marketing companies, as well as paint companies, will be a smart play on dollar weakness as well crude oil which is now hovering near the $50/bbl mark. Apart from those companies with higher dollar denominated debt will also benefit from rupee appreciation.

A strong rupee is positive for companies who hold FCCB and thus pay lesser interest outflow in dollar terms says our Fundamental Research Analyst, Dhiral Shah. Stocks to benefit will be Vedanta Ltd, Havells India, and to some extent even to Bharti Airtel.

Also OMC stocks like IOC, BPCL & HPCL along with paint and varnish companies like Asian Paint, Berger Paint will benefit from strong rupee as their major input costs are from the import of crude oil internationally.

Here is a list of ten companies which can benefit the most from rupee appreciation and how are they placed on the technical charts.

Analyst: Pushkaraj Kanitkar, AVP Technical Research at GEPL capital

HPCL: Target Rs 540

In the calendar year 2017, the stock price moved from a level of Rs 415 at the start of January to Rs 580 in mid-February. The same has met with a correction over the last 2 months with about 50 per cent Fibonacci retracement marked around Rs 497.

The level of around Rs 490 also houses the longer term 100-days moving average (DMA). A correction in crude oil as well as the USD still seems to be not discounted and may give rise to a bounce back at least to a level of around Rs 540.

Thus the risk reward looks in favor of the bulls from here on. A move sustaining below Rs 490 would be the only risk element involved.

BPCL: Target Rs 675-680

The price chart houses the 200-DMA placed at Rs 618 mark. The level of Rs 600 also corresponds to the 6-month low. Earlier leg of the rally saw a rise from Rs 605 to Rs 730 that was met with a drift down to the Rs 620 mark that had the 200 DMA. A bounce back to levels around Rs 675-680 may not be ruled out.

India Oil Corporation: Target Rs 402

This stock is the strongest of the lot amongst the OMCs. ICO has corrected just around 6 per cent from an all-time high of Rs 402. The level of Rs 345-360 also corresponds to the consolidation zone of January 2017.

The level of Rs 365-370 also houses the 55-DMA as also the 23.6 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the earlier leg. Hence, the risk-reward ration looks favourable.

Asian Paints: Target Rs 1145

The earlier move from Rs 1,225 in October 2016 to Rs 860 in December 2016 has met with a strong bounce back that crossed the 50 per cent retracement placed at Rs 1,044.

The current move maintains in a rational uptrend parsing a higher top and higher bottom formation. The upside targets of Rs 1,145 maybe on the cards with a trading stop placed at the 200-DMA placed at Rs 1,030.

Berger Paints: Target Rs 275

The scrip saw a sharp correction in November 2016 that spaced from Rs 275 to Rs 175. This move has met with a bounce back and the prices are now trading in a close channel ranging from Rs 200-235 over the last 3 months, a sign of good consolidation.

One may ideally play a breakout above this range around the Rs 240 mark, with a possible target of Rs 275 mark.

Analyst: Abnish Kumar Sudhanshu, Director & Research Head, Amrapali Aadya Trading & Investments

Tata Power: Target Rs 91.6

Tata Power will be impacted as the price of coal that the company import is linked to international prices. Investors can look at buying the stock for a target of Rs 91.6 and a stop loss of Rs 84.

Tata Steel: Target Rs 509

Tata Steel who is the importer of iron ore may be also benefitted. Investors can buy the stock for a short term target of Rs 509 and a stop loss of Rs 488.

Hindalco: Target Rs 200

The company is likely to benefit from the rupee rise as its realisations are import parity linked while alumina requirements of its Indian operations are met from domestic sources. Investors can buy the stock for a short term target of Rs 200 and a stop loss of Rs 187.

Titan Company: Target Rs 463

‘Gems & jewellery’ companies remain fruitful from the rupee appreciation. India has been importing gold from the international market. Hence, rupee strengthening increases these companies margin significantly.

Investors can accumulate Titan Company keeping a short term target of Rs 463 and a stop loss of Rs 435.

Gitanjali Gems: Target Rs 70.9

Gitanjali Gems which belongs to the gems and the jewellery sectors will remain in focus if the rupee continues to trade higher against the dollar. Investors can buy the stock with a short term target of Rs 70.90 and a stop loss of Rs 64.75.

Madhuchanda DeyMoneycontrol ResearchThe BJP tsunami in Uttar Pradesh will counter any impact of feared rate increases in the United States and send markets climbing towards Mount 30k after a saffron-splashed long Holi weekend. But what can an emboldened PM Narendra Modi incrementally deliver that markets should watch for and how should investors’ position portfolios for the medium term? Three key themes should get a boost – fiscal prudence, anti-corruption and GST.First, the big picture. The victory fashioned by Modi in India’s politically most important state will inevitably be seen as a thumbs-up for demonetisation; the failure of the Aam Aadmi Party in expanding beyond Delhi will also reassure those who want no threat, however small, to a dominant single party at the Centre. This result will give a lot of confidence to the ‘long-term’ money already invested/waiting to be invested in India as it could mean seven years of uninterrupted governance of India by the BJP.The pace of reforms should continue, perhaps accelerate as with better strength in Rajya Sabha in 2018, the government may push forward bolder changes in sensitive areas like labour and banking. So after the initial hiccup of possible Fed rate increases, markets could look forward to renewed support from Foreign Institutional Investors (FII).The domestic money that has overwhelmingly supported the markets and is a much more stable flow compared to its foreign counterpart will gather steam as the subtle but steady shift from physical savings (gold and real estate) to financial savings take place. The interest in mid- and small- cap spaces will be alive notwithstanding the seemingly stretched valuation.The other political change the market will have to focus on in the near term is the nature of a Cabinet reshuffle that takes place post the government formation in the states. A more dynamic leadership in key Cabinet positions is what the markets want.Now the three themes, starting with fiscal prudence:In the absence of private capex revival, while targeted government capital expenditure would continue (hence selectively support capex-related companies), the political mandate would prevent runaway populism that could have derailed the fiscal math, further crowded out private capital and exerted pressure on interest rates. So directionally this is positive for financials, not blanket nevertheless as the poll promise of loan waiver could be a near-term dampener for PSU banks. We would like to focus on strong franchises like State Bank of India and ICICI Bank where valuation is supressed compared to peers on account of asset quality woes.Anti-corruption:This is all about a crackdown on black money, a push for transparency and digitisation. The war on black money, coupled with the move to encourage financial savings, shouldn’t augur well for real estate companies catering to big-ticket housing. However, affordable housing will get a big leg-up that should salvage sectors and companies operating in cement, steel, electricals etc. While valuation comfort in this space is limited at this point, market gyrations could provide opportunity.GST:Finally, turning to GST (Goods & Service Tax), the four supporting bills that are lined up in the second half of Budget session should see the light of the day paving the way for GST rollout. While in the absence of the applicable effective tax rate, it wouldn’t be prudent to comment on individual companies, the themes to focus on are the followings: Shift of trade from unorganised segments to organised segments, and revamping supply chain management. Consumer companies ranging from Pidilite, Asian Paints, Century Ply, auto ancillary companies like Exide, Amara Raja that still have to deal with unorganised competition and light electrical makers like V Guard, Havells, Crompton Consumers should all benefit. Logistics players of the likes of Transport Corporation of India, Gati etc should also see much better opportunity. The other sector where there are overt gains from tax rationalisation are the multiplex companies like PVR, Inox etc. While keeping the shopping bag ready, investors should wait for market gyration to build up positions.The question that would be crossing investors mind would be - is the timing right?Markets never reward investors who try to 'time the market’. However, a few data points are of interest to us. While markets had a decent run post the initial demonetisation blues with no overwhelming support of earnings, the valuations, while not undemanding, can re-rate if earnings support kicks in a few quarters down. The election verdict removes one major political uncertainty. Smart money will be watchful of all the lows to build up positions, and investors should keep the same in mind in the long marathon.",762,0.0

With each passing day, the micro data from companies makes the macro GDP numbers look puzzling.

Savour the latest takeaways from the analysts’ call of Bharat Financial Ltd. The microfinance company said that improvement in collections has been slow: 4.4 percent of the portfolio has remained overdue for more than two months. In the normal course, this course would have been recognised as NPA (along with income reversal). In addition, the shortfall in collections in the off book (6-12 percent) i.e. loans lent through business correspondents. In the quarter before demonetisation, the company had only 0.1 percent of gross non-performing assets or GNPAs.

While Equitas Holdings and Ujjivan Financial Services —other finance companies that lend to small borrowers have not yet given us the latest tally — saw scars in their Q3 performance. Fresh loan disbursements fell 20-25 percent from the previous quarter and that was because the collection of dues fell from their usual 99 percent-plus levels. Equitas it had loan defaults of Rs 145 crore, which it didn’t have to recognise because of the Reserve Bank of India’s relaxed rules.

Going up the food chain, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services said its GNPAs would have risen to 12.5 percent from 11.1 percent in the previous quarter but it was saved by RBI’s relaxed rules. Shriram Transport would have seen a jump in bad loans from 6.6 percent to 7.3 percent. Both saw barely any growth in loans.

The lack of demand or purchasing power of the Indian consumer was writ large on two-wheeler sales. Hero Moto, Bajaj and TVS saw sales dip by 5-22 percent in the months of November and December against a growth in sales of about 4 percent in the previous quarter. In fact, even in January and February, these companies continued to report 5-10 percent of lower sales from year-ago levels.

Among consumer companies basket, Asian Paints reported a 3 percent growth in Q3 volumes versus 12 percent in Q2 and 16 percent in the third quarter a year ago. Hindustan Unilever saw a 4 percent contraction in sales against a 6 percent growth year ago and 1 percent contraction in the previous quarter. Dabur saw a 5 percent contraction in volumes versus a 4.5 percent growth in the previous quarter, though its year-ago quarter saw poor volumes. And Britannia saw a 2 percent volume growth in Q3 versus an 11 percent growth year ago; while Marico saw a 4 percent contraction as against a 10.5 percent growth in sales volumes year ago.

The GDP numbers themselves show that the gross value added (GVA), which is growth, net of taxes, has slowed to 6.6 percent. But even this growth wouldn’t have been 6 percent had not the previous year’s number been revised lower just a few weeks before the release of the Q3 GDP numbers. The CSO’s revision of the 2015-16 GDP numbers of January 31 this year was puzzling. Overall, GDP growth was revised higher from 7.6% to 7.9%. The GVA for Q1, Q2 and Q4 were revised higher. Only for Q3 of 2015-16 the GVA was revised lower by about Rs 12,000 crore.

Even in the flattering 6.6 percent GVA — not counting the farm output and government spending — would have risen by only 5.8 percent.

Finally, making a mockery of the entire data collecting exercise is the GDP from the expenditure side which indicates that private consumption in the third quarter rose by 10.6 percent in the October-December period. If the top 10 listed consumption companies have reported contraction in sales volumes, it is tough to see which part of India was consuming so much.

One hopes the woefully divorced macros and micros of the Indian economy will be patched up somewhat next year when the revised GDP number for 2016-17 will be announced.",644,-0.7069616847568088

The Budget-induced optimism got a leg to stand on as the Sensex today pushed higher for the fourth day by scoring 199 points to close at 28,439 -- a 4-month high -- after hopes built up that RBI might go in for a rate cut at the Wednesday's policy meet.

The NSE Nifty retook the crucial 8,800-mark today.

At its last policy review in December, RBI in a surprise move had decided to leave rates unchanged, but this time a lower retail inflation and fiscal discipline as shown in the Budget have prompted calls for RBI to remain accommodative.

Global leads aligned as most Asian shares ended higher, tracking weekend gains in the US on better-than-expected jump in US jobs and a move by President Donald Trump to cut back financial regulations, accelerating buying pace by investors.

The 30-share Sensex ended up 198.76 points, or 0.70 percent at 28,439.28, its highest closing since September 23 last year when it had closed at 28,668.22. Intra-day, it sprang to a high of 28,487.28.

The gauge had rallied 584.56 points in the previous three sessions after the presentation of the Budget on February 1.

The NSE Nifty regained control of the 8,800-mark and added 60.10 points, or 0.69 percent, at 8,801.05 at the close. On September 23, the index finished at 8,831.55.

""Markets continued to be buoyant on the expectation of rate cut by RBI and positive global cues. We are seeing continuation of rally in the rate sensitive sectors led by reality, banks and FMCG which were also supported by Budget related sops,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services.

Major European indices stayed in the positive zone, too.

Data showed that foreign institutional investors bought shares worth Rs 353.84 crore last Friday, adding to the level of optimism.

The rupee appreciated for the 9th straight day to trade at a fresh 2-1/2 month high of 67.14 (intra-day) against the dollar, keeping the overall mood upbeat.

A good 22 stocks in the 30-share Sensex pack advanced while 8 turned lower.

Sun Pharma led the charge by surging 4.20 percent while ICICI Bank zoomed 3.18 percent.

Adani Ports, Axis Bank, Hero MotoCorp, ITC Ltd, HUL, GAIL, NTPC, Asian Paints, Wipro, RIL, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and L&T supported the ongoing bull run.

BSE realty jumped the most (up 1.90 percent) followed by FMCG (1.28 percent), healthcare (1.27 percent) and consumer durables (1.27 percent).

Broader markets remained in the green too, with the mid-cap index advancing 1.10 percent and small-cap 0.88 percent.

Realty stocks continued their upward journey, buoyed by the infrastructure status to affordable housing in the Budget 2017-18 to encourage investment in the segment, which offered tax sops to developers to complete unsold inventories.

In the realty space, HDIL soared 7.80 percent, Godrej Properties surged 3.32 percent, Prestige Estates Projects 2.83 percent and DLF 1.32 percent.

Malini BhuptaMoneycontrolIn uncertain times, defensive sectors are good places to hide, but a contrarian view this time around would be more profitable. Even though 2017 is expected to be a year of uncertainties, equity strategists are advising cyclical stocks over safe havens.While impact of GST rollout and pace of economic recovery after demonetisation are known domestic variables, Trumponomics and the impact of protectionist policies adopted by several developed economies remain key global uncertainties. In such challenging times, a good place to hide would be defensive sectors like consumer, pharmaceuticals and IT services, but this time around the market is betting on cyclicals, in the hope that infrastructure spending will get a boost in this year’s Budget.Don't expect consumption to revive anytime soonThe economy may be limping back to normalcy after high value currency notes were invalidated in November; consumer companies are not likely to see a 'U’ shaped recovery. Small wonder then that the market is placing its bets on cyclical stocks. While IDFC Securities expects relatively higher fiscal stimulus on the consumption side (compared to capex), it believes the move will only help bring consumption demand back to normal levels (which was dented by demonetization). Hence, the brokerage prefers non-consumption themes – B2B businesses, high dividend yield stories and businesses with stronger outlook outside the country.Earnings of cyclicals to outpace defensivesEarnings recovery in some sectors is another trigger for select cyclicals. Given that select commodity prices have been moving up, earnings trajectory of metal companies is expected to improve. Religare Capital Markets expects earnings growth of energy and metals to rise to 16.5 percent while IT is expected to report stagnant earnings. Cement, construction & infrastructure and capital goods are among the few sectors that are expected to report double-digit earnings growth. According to Motilal Oswal Securities, December quarter’s earnings growth would be driven by cyclicals – cement, capital goods and oil & gas are expected to post 24 percent, 59 percent and 42 percent earnings growth, respectively. Consequently, the share of defensives in overall earnings will also decline in FY17.Budget to give a leg-up to cyclicalsThe immediate trigger for cyclical stocks will come from the Budget, scheduled to be presented by the Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on February 1. By now it is an accepted fact that the government will deviate from the path of fiscal consolidation and stimulate the economy by transferring more money in the hands of tax payers to ease the pain of demonetisation. If this were to actually happen in a meaningful way, consumption would get a boost. But given the FM's limited fiscal room, a section of economists believe that the stimulus may come in the form of higher capital expenditure by the government.Morgan Stanley’s base case view is that the government will not use fiscal stimulus to revive domestic demand, considering the starting point of tight fiscal space. Sectoral analysts at the global investment bank expect the Budget to be positive for autos, cement & metals, consumer, Internet and e-commerce, media and real estate. Most economists and strategists do not expect remonetisation to substantially revive consumption to levels higher than the pre-note ban era.Scorecard for key stocksTop Performers of 2016 Hindalco (+83 percent), Yes Bank (+59 percent), Tata Steel (+51 percent), BPCL (+42 percent) and Power Grid (+30 percent).Worst performers of 2016Idea (-49 percent), BHEL (-28 percent), Aurobindo (-24 percent), Sun Pharma (-23 percent) and Bharti Infratel (-20 percent) were the worst performers.Winners for five straight yearsSix Nifty stocks – Eicher, Maruti, IndusInd Bank, Zee Entertainment, Asian Paints and Kotak Mahindra Bank – delivered positive returns for five straight years.Stocks that delivered negative returns for first time in five year.Stocks delivering negative returns for the first time in the last five years wereAurobindo, Lupin, M&M, HUL and HCL Tech.",638,0.0
2017-01-29 01:00:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/wallpapers-for-quickinexpensive-makeovers-947623.html,"Smart use of wallpaper can add sparkle to a space and complement the overall design of the room. Wallpapers of vibrant colours, textures and materials can also be used as accent elements for the entire room.

“With a wide range of wallpapers, from 3D stone walls to beautiful Hawaiian scenery and artistic patterns now available in the market, it can be used to immediately set the mood for a space,” states Prashant Chauhan, creative director of Zero 9 design firm.

Apart from the ones that are available, home owners can also opt for customised wallpapers – one can use print wallpapers with metallic patterns, to make the space more regal, or opt for contrasting colours of one’s choice, to brighten up a space.

Beauty as well as utility Besides aesthetic appeal, wallpapers also have utility value. “For example, the ‘writable wallpaper’ makes perfect sense for homes with children, who may try to scribble on the walls, as these writings can be easily erased. Wallpapers with higher sound absorbing capacity can be used in home-offices or meditation spaces, which require lesser sound interference,” adds Chauhan.

Wallpapers are a reliable and simple way to transform one’s home during festivals. Putting up wallpaper is not at all time consuming, maintains interior designer Anish Motwani, of Anish Motwani Associate. “However, if the wall has any leakage problem, then, the wallpaper will peel off. The leakage has to be stopped first and wall has to be treated. Small cracks, dampness, etc., should be repaired before the wallpaper is used,” advises Motwani.

For every room Light-coloured wallpapers, with patterns that add a little shine to the surface, are ideal for the living room. Radhika Shahane, a home maker from Pune, used the colour white extensively in her home’s walls. “White walls make the room appear spacious and sophisticated. To break the monotony, I used a red floral print wallpaper for the dining area. It had a dramatic effect and brightened up the entire room,” she shares. “To make the living room appear glamorous, one can also opt for red and gold or silver and blue wallpapers, as a highlight on one of the walls,” suggests Motwani.

Textured wallpapers in a neutral colour, can be used on the wall where the television is mounted, behind the sofa set, behind the bed, or even on the entry foyer of the house. For the children’s room opt for writable/washable wallpapers, or even themed wallpapers of their favourite cartoons. For the master bedroom, it is advisable to choose cosy and darker tones.

How to choose the right wallpaper Decide the theme of the room first and then select the wallpaper (floral or geometric patterns, vintage or Indian designs, scenic pictures, animated characters, or wallpapers with silk, vinyl, jute, velvet or metallic effect). The patterns should match and complement the curtains and other upholstery. Use only one or two hues throughout the room, to avoid visual clutter. One can choose wallpapers from various brands, such as Marshalls, India Circus (Krsna Mehta), Elementto, D’décor and Nilaya by Asian Paints. The biggest advantage of using wallpapers, is that it can be changed easily and is available in various budgets.

Tips

In small spaces, vibrant wallpapers should be used sparingly as a bright accent. To add a luxurious feel, use wallpapers with a metallic gold effect. Always ensure that good quality adhesive is used. Avoid wallpapers with big patterns, if the room is small. Instead, opt for small motifs that make the room look spacious. Good quality wallpapers will easily last for five years, if used in a proper way. Photos courtesy: Nilaya Signature Series, Asian Paints

ICICI Direct's research report on Asian Paints

APL is the industry leader in the decorative paint segment with 53% market share and a dealer network of over 40,000 across India. It derives 81% of its topline from the decorative segment while the rest comes from the industrial segment. We believe consumer durable companies will be key beneficiaries of the government’s key reforms like implementation of GST and pay hike.

Outlook

We introduce FY19 estimates with sales CAGR of 10.3% in FY16-19E led by volume CAGR of 9%. We believe, being market leader in the decorative paint segment, any price hike in the raw material would be easily passed on to its customers. The company would maintain EBITDA margin at 17% despite higher raw material prices. As a result, PAT is likely to record CAGR of 13% for FY16-19E. Also, high cash on the books could lead to an increase in dividend payout and improvement in RoEs. We roll over valuation on FY19E and value the stock at 40x FY19E earnings. We reiterate our BUY recommendation on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 1090/share.

Asian Paints’ (APL) Q3FY17 consolidated sales (up 2.6% YoY), EBITDA (down 1.2%) and adj. PAT (down 8.4%) exceeded our expectations. As against our expectation of volume dip (factoring demonetisation impact), APL’s domestic decorative segment volumes grew 3% YoY on a base of 14% YoY growth, partially aided by festive season.

Outlook

APL remains key beneficiary of recovery in urban demand and GDP revival. In our view, decorative volumes should pick up FY18 onwards — penetration at 43% bodes well. We estimate 22% EPS CAGR over FY17-19. The stock is trading at 37.8x FY18E and 30.8x FY19E EPS. We maintain ‘BUY /SO’ with TP of INR 1,191.

The demand outlook remains uncertain due to the impact of demonetisation, with North and Central India being worse off than South and West India.

Outlook

Gross margins expanded 60bps YoY (-200bps QoQ), but higher other expenses and staff costs restricted EBITDA margins to 17.8% (-70bps YoY).

Dolat Capital's research report on Asian Paints

APL’s high volume growth trajectory is interrupted as the company reported mere 4% volume growth compared to double-digit growth in past four quarters. Nevertheless, the growth was not disappointing considering negative growth for other consumer companies like Bajaj Corp and HUL.

OutlookWe remain optimistic about the domestic paints industry considering: (1) better monsoon (2) changing macros (3) favorable base and (4) expected pent-up demand in the category.

9:30 am FII view: Abhay Laijawala of Deutsche Bank says he expects FY18 Budget to be centered around a sharp pro-poor/pro-rural focus in an attempt to mitigate the perceived hardships of demonetisation and stimulate demand.

According to him, Budget is likely to focus disproportionately on affordable housing as an engine of economic revival.

Further announcements on roadmap for rationalising the corporate tax architecture by lowering the tax rate and phasing out exemptions are expected, he says.

Tax on financial market transactions and an overhaul of direct taxation by reducing tax incidence for the middle class, likely financed through a mix of tax on financial instruments and higher tax rate at the upper end of the income pyramid can be expected, Laijawala feels.

Country's top 100 companies in terms of market valuation have generated Rs 28.4 lakh crore wealth in the last five years, with Tata Group firm TCS retaining the numero uno position in the chart, says a latest study.

According to the leading brokerage firm Motilal Oswal's '21st Annual Wealth Creation Study', TCS is the biggest wealth creator for generating over Rs 2.6 lakh crore for the period 2011-16. The firm has retained the rank for the fourth year in a row.

The IT giant was followed by private sector lender HDFC Bank, as per the study, which looks into top 100 wealth creating companies during the period 2011-16.

Overall, top 100 companies created Rs 28.4 lakh crore during 2011-16, which is the third highest ever quantum of amount generated.

The wealth created is calculated as change in the market cap of companies between 2011 and 2016, duly adjusted for corporate events such as mergers, de-mergers, fresh issuance of capital, buyback, among others.

While Ajanta Pharma was found to be the fastest wealth creator for the second year in a row, Asian Paints emerged as the most consistent wealth generator.

Sector-wise, consumer/retail emerged as the country's biggest wealth creating industry for the second consecutive time.

The report noted that public sector undertakings wealth creation performance continues to be dismal during 2011-16.

Only 7 PSUs -- BPCL, HPCL, Petronet LNG, Concor, LIC Housing, Bharat Electronics and Power Grid Corporation -- figure in the top 100 wealth creators list and contributed to 4 per cent of the total wealth generation.

Meanwhile, wealth worth Rs 15 trillion was destroyed during 2011-16. This accounts for 53 per cent of the total wealth created by top 100 companies.

""Seven of the top 10 wealth destroyers are in the business of global commodities,"" Motilal Oswal said.

""Metals/mining is the biggest wealth-destroying sector as was the case last year, followed by banking and finance, which mainly includes state-owned banks at the wrong end of the NPA cycle,"" it added.

Motilal Oswal noted that while the compound annual growth rate of Sensex stood at 5 per cent, the pace of wealth creation was healthy at 18 per cent CAGR.

""This reinforces the point that wealth creation happens in all kinds of market conditions. So, investors are better off focusing on which stocks to invest in, rather than timing the markets,"" it said.",403,0.704704999923706

The Chinese embargo or limits on metal buying will definitely be seen negative by investors, says SP Tulsian of SPTulsian.com'. He says he has cautious call on Hindalco. Below is the verbatim transcript of SP Tulsian's interview to Anuj Singhal and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.

Anuj: Your thoughts first on what transpired in last one hour in the Bank Nifty that Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) issue and the fact that we saw so much intraday volatility?

A: Maybe market is playing to all sort of news which we have seen in this last one hour of MSS getting raise to about Rs 6 lakh crore for 28 days window. Now if you see the background I don’t think that news anyone had any doubt that this will not come and again we are all going to see the rate cut also as per the estimates all going on, but market likes to play on each and every news and the volatility gets created. Honestly, if you really see the announcement of this news flow, I don’t think that there is anything new to that and one should take this as a surprise, because this has been the CRR hike has to get offset by the MSS which has all being expected. The Rs 6 lakh crore which has come now is way ahead of the amount which has been squeezed via CRR — so I think both these news may be now it just a matter of the order in which these things will follow, because this MSS will come for 28 days now whether this comes after the rate cut or prior to rate cut is just a matter of what you call the strategy of the RBI to be decided, but there is nothing new in this news flow which has come in.

Sonia: I wanted your thoughts on a couple of stocks that have been the biggest losers this week. One of them is Hindalco which is down almost 7 percent for the week. It had a great trend up until this week, but now there is some profit taking. So, would you at any point, look to buy into it and the other one is Asian Paints. We have spoken about this is in the past, but once again this week, it has been the big loser. What would you do with two of these names?

A: If you first come on the Hindalco, if you see China has put an embargo or some kind of limits on the metal buying also and that will definitely be seen negative. So yes, you have to keep a cautious or negative call on all the metal stocks. The kind of run up which we have seen, maybe some of the zinc and lead producers, the secondary lead smelters also like Nile, Pondi Oxides or maybe Gravita kind of things. So, you have to have a cautious view on all the metals stocks, but specifically on Hindalco, I have never in fact convinced with this kind of run up, because if you see the business model, I do not see in what way the company is seen to be enjoying this upsurge in the metal prices also because they are the primary aluminium producers and they have not seen much benefits really flowing to them and for the copper, I do not think they are really enjoying any kind of benefits being TCRC earning only accruing to them.

Coming on Asian Paints, definitely the rising crude will be seen negative for the paint industry and you need to have a cautious view on both. So, maybe I will not take a buy call or positive call on both the stocks.

Anuj: The point Sonia makes is quite relevant. For Swift and Swift Dzire, for example, they sell off like hot cakes I have not heard of discounts at least in this bracket from Maruti. What is your thought on this stock now at Rs 5,000-5,050?

A: If you take a call from Maruti point of view, I think this strategy is perfectly right on part of the, because either you cut the production and you see the sales falling maybe to a level of 1,00,000 cars per month and all sort of things. Number two, I have always maintained that when the stock has moved to a level of Rs 5,300-5,400 that the stock has reached to its optimum level. But the kind of bullish views presented at that point of time, in fact if you take a chart or maybe the view on Maruti of the last six months, it was bizarre. When it was ruling at Rs 3,300-3,400, people have been giving a negative call because the yen was hardening against the dollar. It moved to a level 102-103 per dollar and the experts have taken a view that things cannot really move up because as long as the yen remains at those levels. Yen did not weaken thereafter, but the stock has almost seen a rise of 60 percent, number one. Number two, at that point of time, I have always been preferring Maruti over Tata Motors, but majority, I am not trying to blame or I am not trying to blow my trumpet, but at that point of time, Tata Motors was liked more by the market which has also proved wrong.

So on this strategy if the profit booking is coming in, it is giving a buying opportunity, maybe at a level below Rs 5,000 because as such you can see the price getting capped for Maruti at Rs 5,400. Nobody can rule out the kind of negative effect likely to be seen because of the demonetisation, but that is likely to remain confined only till December. I do not think that the shortage of currency supply will go beyond there and the things will dramatically change. And just to recap, in maybe the last couple of days when the market was moving up, I have seen the experts changing the view that the effect of demonetisation will not be very high. On November 30, when I was asked that why the automobile stocks have been going up, people have all been saying that probably the hit may not be that bad for the two-wheelers and cars. So, we keep changing our views looking to the market movement. But I do not think that the things were looking positive as such till December 31 otherwise also and I will not be too disturbed with this Maruti strategy and if it falls below Rs 5,000 then it qualifies a buy as an investor.

Sonia: We have discussed this earlier, but anything from the paint companies, the tyre companies that got impacted this week, because of higher crude prices or even aviation companies you have been negative on aviation stocks, but what about the other pockets?

A: Yesterday, in fact I have expressed this because of this crude three sectors are going to get impacted; one is the paint stocks, second is the telecom stocks and third even if you take a call on the tyre stocks also. Aviation, paint and telecom because mind it in the telecom the towers are consuming lot of diesel and no one has really talked of that and if you have the double whammy like Jio extending their free schemes till March 31 that is also seen quite bad for them.

Coming on tyre stocks if you see the price behaviour or the pattern the rubber prices have gone up in China than corrected couple of days back and it has been swinging to that volatility. If you really see the situation prevailing here in India, the Q2 numbers have not really cheered much and so what I feel that all the tyre stocks seem to have picked out and will only give you the volatility depends on the natural rubber prices behaviour and if you take the synthetic rubber also styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) that will also be seen going expensive with the rising crude prices, so negative or maybe cautious view on all the four sectors which I have stated.

Anuj: Any stock that has corrected which you fundamentally like right now?

A: If you want to take a sector rotation call then already cement and non-banking finance companies (NBFC) which were recommended by me about two weeks back have given a good profits. You have referred for Grasim, so if I take a call on three Grasim related stocks, that is Grasim, Aditya Birla Nuvo and UltraTech Cement. I am keeping a positive bias on all three. And if you take a call now on the auto ancillary stocks, probably they are looking quite good and amongst them, maybe like Pricol which is going for the restructuring from this Monday, maybe there will be a delisting or maybe the suspension for about a couple of weeks but I really find huge value in that. Or maybe like Ucal Fuel Systems, Rico Auto, Harita Seatings, so I am quite positive on the auto ancillary stocks at the current level.",1530,-0.7127233147621155

Geojit BNP Paribas' research report on Asian Paints

The effect of demonetisation will impact the discretionary spending as consumers with a liquidity crunch may postpone the purchase. The current pace in demand revival in rural economy on account of good monsoon will get delayed. A slow pace in real estate demand will also add uncertainty. We therefore reduce our revenue estimate for FY17E /FY18E by 2%& 3% respectively.

We expect the volume growth is likely to get impacted due to the liquidity crunch. It seems that the recent correction in price has largely factored all the near term negatives. We value APNT at 37x (5yr. avg) P/E and roll our estimate to FY19E, with a target price of Rs 1,108. We upgrade our rating to ‘BUY’ from ‘Reduce’ as we believe that near term negatives are largely factored in the stock price.

9:30 am FII view: Ridham Desai of Morgan Stanley says the low return environment that India seems to be trapped but may get a breather in 2017 due to better equity valuations, bottoming of growth cycle (disrupted temporarily by the recent demonetisation) and higher correlations with world equities on which the brokerage house is more constructive.

If history is a guide, the trailing EPS growth sets up Indian stocks for strong medium term performance.

Proprietary sentiment indicator has still not hit the buy zone so there may be some downside in the near term and thus, the recovery from the recent damage to share prices may not be V-shaped, he feels.

Desai says India's macro stability remains in its best shape in several years and policy momentum is the best since 2007. Financial conditions look easy and the inflation trajectory suggests more rate cuts are in the pipeline, he feels.

Reliance Securitie's research report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints (APNT) reported strong set of numbers in 2QFY17 with consolidated revenues growing by 9.6% to Rs 37.2 bn and net profit increasing by 18.1% to Rs 4.9 bn. Notwithstanding the impact of extended monsoon which led to weaker consumer demand in certain key markets, volume growth of 12% yoy is impressive, in our view. We estimate APNT to post 13.3% & 20.2% CAGR in revenues and earnings through FY16-18E. Considering that the stock price has remained flat since 1QFY17 results and rolling forward of target price to 2QFY18E, we upgrade our recommendation on the stock to HOLD from REDUCE with a revised Target Price of Rs 1,154.

We expect volume growth momentum to improve, going forward, while APNT is likely to sustain current margin profile owing to superior branding and pricing power. We estimate APNT to post consolidated revenues of Rs 174.2 bn & Rs 199.3 bn and PAT of Rs 21.5 bn & Rs 24.9 bn in FY17E & FY18E, respectively. Though at CMP, the stock currently trades at expensive multiples of 43.9x FY18E earnings, we believe that APNT would continue to command premium owing to superior volume growth trajectory. We upgrade our recommendation on the stock to HOLD from REDUCE with revised Target Price of Rs 1,154 (from Rs 1,082 earlier) based on 40x Sep’18 EPS.

They will be discussing the manner in which the Cyrus Mistry affair was handled. It is learnt these directors will also be bringing these concerns to the board. Three of the four directors CNBC-TV18 spoke to said they were disconnected with the decision taken at Tata Sons and shocked by Mistry’s ouster. Regarding Mistry’s letter on Nano’s viability, the directors said concerns were raised over the future of the Nano. However, one of the directors said that it is not easy to shut down the Nano quickly. They didn’t agree with Mistry that Nano was kept alive only for emotional reasons as mentioned in Mistry’s letter.11:30 am Interview: Speaking to CNBC-TV18 Saugata Gupta, MD & CEO OF Marico explained the reasons behind the lower-than-estimated volume growth this quarter. “The issue was related to Parachute. We perhaps took a premature price increase which was not in line with input costs. Rural consumption was stressed. We are optimistic of a recovery; greenshoots are seen in durables, auto.” A poor Q2 show by Parachute coconut oil (27 percent of overall revenues) hit Marico’s results for the second quarter. He said he was comfortable with their operating margin of 17-18 percent. Margins will be slightly lower than the first half of the year, going forward, he said. “We will get out of the deflation effect.” There won’t be price cuts as input costs have bottomed out, he said, adding that Maico will be price competitive.Don't miss: Buy, sell, hold: 13 stocks for your portfolio

Days after quiting as the Tata Group's HR head, N S Rajan has now resigned as a non-executive director of its hospitality arm Indian Hotels Company Ltd with effect from October 28.

""We wish to inform you that Dr. N S Rajan has resigned as a Non-Executive Director of the Company with effect from October 28, 2016,"" Indian Hotels Company said in a BSE filing today.

Last week, Rajan had stepped down as the chief of human resources (CHRO) of Tata Group.

Rajan was one of the members of the now disbanded Group Executive Council (GEC) set up by ousted Tata Sons' chairman Cyrus Mistry.

Rajan came on board of the GEC in May 2013 after it was set up a month earlier, headed by Mistry with the objective of providing strategic and operational support to him.

Last week, when the ouster of Mistry by the Tata Sons board was announced, the GEC was also disbanded.

Before joining the Tata group, N S Rajan was partner and global leader, people and organisation, EY.

Dolat Capital's research report on Asian Paints

APL continues to maintain high volume growth trajectory in 2QFY17. Our analysis suggest that the company has reported 12-13% volume growth - commendable considering slowdown in most of the other consumer categories. We remain optimistic about the domestic paints industry considering (1) better monsoon (2) changing macros (3) favorable base and (4) expected pent up demand in the category. APL being a leader in the market (53% MS), is most likely to benefit from the growing demand. However, peaking out of margins would restrict profitability. Maintain Accumulate with TP of Rs 1,163 (38x FY19 EPS).

Though GM expanded YoY in 2QFY17, it contracted significantly by 270bps QoQ - raises concerns over the margins in the ensuing quarters. We believe that the last leg of margin expansion is over and the company would have to battle against a very unfavorable base going ahead.

Asian Paints today reported an 18.11 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 494.76 crore for the September quarter, driven by robust growth in its decorative business segment.

The company had posted a net profit of Rs 418.87 crore in the July-September quarter of the previous fiscal, Asian Paints said in a filing to the BSE.

Asian Paints' total income from operation on consolidated basis was up 10.23 per cent to Rs 4,232.46 crore during the quarter under review as against Rs 3,839.66 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.

""The decorative business segment in India registered a double digit growth in the quarter. However, a prolonged monsoon did affect demand in west and central India. Good demand condition in the auto OEM and general industrial business segment led to improved performance of the automotive coating JV (PPG-AP),"" said Asian Paints MD & CEO K B S Anand.

The international business reported good numbers specifically aided by contribution from good pick-up in demand in Nepal, Fiji and certain units in the Middle East, he further added.

Its total expenses were up 9.22 per cent to Rs 3,603.83 crore as against Rs 3,299.32 crore.

In the first-half of the current fiscal, Asian Paints' consolidated standalone net profit was up 18.30 per cent to Rs 1,047.32 crore as against Rs 885.29 crore in the six-month period a year ago.

Asian Paints' total income in first half of the current fiscal was also up 10.23 cent to Rs 8,314.54 crore compared to Rs 7,542.70 crore in the same period last year.

Meanwhile in a separate filing, Asian Paints informed that its board in a meeting held today ""considered and approved"" payment of interim dividend of Rs 2.65 per equity share of the face value of Re 1 each for the financial year ending March 31, 2017.

The overall value of top 50 brands in the country witnessed a marginal dip of 2 percent this year, almost entirely driven by the decline in brand value of state-owned banks, according to a recent study.

However, the brand value of India's top 50 brands has increased by 30 percent over the last three years, as per the BrandZ study conducted by research agency Millward Brown and commissioned by WPP, which was released here.

The total value of the country's top 50 brands stood at USD 90.5 billion from USD 92.2 billion in 2015.

""The 2 percent adjustment is primarily attributable to state-owned banks, which declined 33 percent in brand value because of loan performance difficulties. With the same state-owned banks removed from the 2015 and 2016 rankings, the value of the India BrandZ Top 50 actually rose 2 percent year on year,"" it said.

Private sector lender HDFC Bank topped the rankings for the third consecutive year with a brand value of USD 14.4 billion, following a 15 percent growth over last year.

Telecom major Airtel and the country's largest lender State Bank of India retained the second and third spot, respectively.

Asian Paints was placed at fourth, followed by ICICI Bank, Bajaj Auto, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Hero and Axis Bank in that order.

The list is dominated by banks and financial companies, accounting for 38 percent of the total value of the top 50 brands.

Retail and aviation brands have entered the top 50 for the first time with Indigo (26) and Jet Airways (36) representing the airline industry while Reliance Retail secured the 50th position.

The study covered 60,000 consumers with over 600 brands across 50 categories in the country.

""Over the past year, brands have had to work hard to hold on to their position in the top 50. 20 brands have witnessed a drop in their ranking within the top 50. Brands which have managed to sustain their ranking over the past two years have only been able to do so by increasing their brand value by over 35 percent,"" Kantar Millward Brown South Asia Managing Director Dinesh Kapoor told reporters here.",369,-0.2000575065612793

Santosh Nairmoneycontrol.comConsistent revenue growth combined with a consistent return on capital employed: if a company has been delivering on these two parameters for over ten years, then look no further. That, in effect, is the theme of Saurabh Mukherjea’s second book 'The Unusual Billionaires'. The book says that a portfolio of companies which satisfies both these criteria will invariably beat the market over the next decade and more.Mukherjea, whose day job is CEO, Institutional Equities at Ambit Capital, feels the buy-and-hold strategy for stock investing holds true even as volatile financial markets and disruptive changes across sectors are questioning its validity.However, the two filters recommended by Mukherjea are not easy to get past; less than 20 companies have managed that over the past decade. Mukherjea feels the bar is not too high; it is just that most promoters lack the discipline that could have helped their firms go from being good companies to great companies. Through the journeys of seven companies which made the leap, Mukherjea narrates the qualities and strategies that helped them get there.Edited excerpts from an interview:Q: Your definition of a great company is one that has delivered a compounded revenue growth of 10 percent and an average return on capital employed of 15 percent over a decade. Your analysis shows that only 18 out of the couple of thousand traded companies on the bourses made the cut over the past decade. What does that tell you?A: Growing a business at a steady pace (10 percent topline growth or better) whilst maintaining healthy levels of profitability (15 percent ROCE or better) over long periods of time is very very hard. I think most people don’t understand how difficult it is to pull this off. As a result companies which are able to achieve this rare feat -18 odd companies out of the 1500 largest companies in India – don’t get the recognition they deserve. That in turn opens up opportunities for the discerning investor who understand how challenging the 10 percent revenue growth plus 15 percent ROCE combination is.If you ask me why is it so hard to pull off this combination? My answer is that most promoters struggle to find a balance between growth and profitability. Balance in business is just as hard to achieve as it is in other spheres of life. As Rama Bijapurkar says in the book, most companies tend to focus on short-term results and hence that makes them frequently do things that deviate away from their articulated strategy. The willingness to resist the temptation of short-term ‘off-strategy’ profits for long-term sustainable gain is not there in most Indian companies. Q: You say that if an investor were to simply buy the stocks that met the two parameters over the last decade and stays put, he can beat the market over the next decade. Is that not making investing a bit too simplistic?A: Buying high quality stocks and holding them for an extended period of time is a well-known mantra in the world of investing. Several legends including Buffett, Bolton and Peter Lynch have espoused such a strategy. What I have done is boil such a long term buy-and-hold strategy down to its very essentials – a simple formula of revenue growth and ROCE to identify high quality stocks – and quantified the market beating investment returns that such a strategy can generate. Just because such a strategy is simple does not mean it is easy. Why is such a strategy not easy to follow? Because it requires patience to buy and hold stocks for a decade. Effectively, the investor has to eschew excitement now for returns ten years from now. Secondly, it requires character to hold on to those stocks whose share prices begin to slip in the second, third, fourth or fifth year of the ten year period. Thirdly, it requires a deeper of understanding of what exactly a great company is i.e. great companies are not those who are lionized by the media; they are the anonymous promoters who slog away quietly decade after decade persistently improving their franchises and delivering the 10 percent revenue growth and 15 percent ROCE combination. Great companies are the Rahul Dravids of the stockmarket (as opposed to the more exciting players like Yuvraj Singh or Sehwag). Q: In a rapidly changing world where business models are getting disrupted frequently, does a buy and hold approach work over the long term?A: It is fashionable for all of us to believe that “change is the only constant”. That may or may not be true but its relevance to the investment style espoused in the book is relatively limited for two reasons: (a) Most focused promoters are able to make technology work for them rather than being disrupted by technology eg. The extensive use of Enterprise Resource Planning tools and software is a trend that Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Marico and Astral Poly have capitalized on and the book explains how each of these companies use ERP to reduce their working capital cycle. (b) The biggest source of disruption for Indian promoters is neither technology, nor the external business environment; it is the promoter himself/herself. 99 percent of promoters that I meet struggle to focus on the same activity beyond 4 or 5 years. After that they tend to get bored and their attention drifts it to the next flavor-of-the-month idea. As a result, the 'change' that takes place is usually triggered by the promoter himself who uses the fig leaf of technological change and/or the external environment as reasons for his change in tack. Q: To quote Buffet, it is important to buy good businesses at the right price. Even after you have identified the stocks with a consistent revenue growth and ROCE, you still need to buy it at a reasonable price. So how does an investor approach these stocks?A: Over the past six years my colleagues at Ambit have shown repeatedly in the research for our clients that for horizons longer than a year valuations do not play a role in generating investment outperformance. I show in the book that over the long run the biggest driver of share prices is ROCE followed by revenue growth. There is zero correlation between valuation multiples and share price returns over long run time periods. In fact, our research shows that investors who try to buy cheaper stocks almost always end up with lower quality portfolio which generates inferior growth in cashflow and earnings. Secondly, Buffett over the past 20 years has brought great franchises at what look like expensive multiples eg. his recent acquisition of Apple shares; my reading is that he too is focused on the underlying drivers of ROCE and growth rather than valuations per se. Thirdly, most of us neither have the acumen nor the resources of a Buffett; hence we need simpler methods to identify outstanding companies. Q: You have mentioned Asian Paints, Page Industries, HDFC Bank, Astral Poly, Axis Bank, Berger Paints and Marico as great companies. Do you see these stocks delivering market beating returns over the next decade? A: One point I repeatedly make in the book is that we have to learn to think of investment in the context of portfolios rather than of stock picks. Even more specifically, the investment style that seems to work in all countries and in all eras is to buy 15-20 high quality companies and hold them for a long period of time, at least a decade. Harking back to the term coined by the late Rob Kirby, I call this style the Coffee Can Portfolio and I show using 16 separate Coffee Can Portfolios that in a typical portfolio you have 2-3 stars (who compound at 35 percent or more over ten years), 2-3 dogs (who go to zero over ten years) and around 8-10 stocks which deliver solid returns (around 15 percent). The blend of these 15 stocks typically gives you 20-30 percent per annum compounded over ten years which is significantly better than the 16 percent that the Sensex gives you on average. I highlight in the book that Peter Thiel, the founder of PayPal, has explained in his book Zero to One why such portfolio constructs are central to Silicon Valley’s success. Q: If an investor were to take a shorter track record of a company, say five years, do the revenue and ROCE parameters still hold good. As in, what are the filters an investor could use to identify great companies in the making?A: The shorter the track record that you use, the greater the scope for error. So, yes you can use a five year revenue growth and ROCE track record but I reckon that you will make more mistakes. In the book I have used a ten year track record and I find that even then 2-3 out of 15 stocks in a portfolio misfire. With a shorter track record, the error rate could be 6 out of 15. That will in turn drag down the return you get from the portfolio and reduce the outperformance that you get from the portfolio vis a vis the Sensex. Q: At a time when valuations seem to be completely disconnected from fundamentals and the market is willing to pay an outsized premium for quality stocks, what is your advice to investors?A: If you are short term trader then you should worry out valuations quite a lot. Valuations matter hugely for short term traders. For long term investors, today’s P/E or P/B multiple or tomorrow’s P/E or P/B multiple is of little relevance; their focus is the fundamental quality of the franchise. To use another cricketing analogy (which is very apt in the context of Rahul Dravid), ‘Form is temporary whereas class is permanent’.",1637,0.0

ICICI Direct's research report on Asian Paints



Asian Paints (APL) posted sales growth of 10% YoY driven by strong domestic and international performance. It reported strong volume growth of 12% supported by strong demand from tier II and tier III cities. We believe realisation has declined 2% YoY mainly because 1) the company has passed on the benefit of lower raw material prices and 2) a change in the product mix Raw material prices as a percent of sales declined 457 bps YoY due to benign raw material prices while other expenses increased 130 bps YoY. As a result, operating margins increased 177 bps YoY. This finally helped in sharp PAT growth of 18.5% YoY. We modelled revenue CAGR of 12% FY16-18E led by volume growth while realisation growth is expected to stay subdued largely due to a change in product mix. We believe PAT would record a CAGR of 23% supported by expansion in EBITDA margin during FY16-18E.

We estimate PAT CAGR of 23% for FY16-18E supported by higher EBITDA margin in FY16-18E (19.1% and 19.2% for FY17E and FY18E, respectively). Considering the sustained leadership position of APL in the decorative paint segment, any price variation in the raw material would be easily passed on to end customers. Also, high cash on the books could lead to an increase in dividend payout and improvement in RoEs. We reiterate our BUY recommendation on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 1310/share.

Asian Paints shares hit a record high of Rs 1,152.65, up 8.55 percent intraday after better-than-expected quarterly earnings aided by strong operational performance and retaining double digits growth in volume.

First quarter (April-June) earnings beat analysts' expectations on Wednesday with consolidated profit growing 18.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 553 crore while revenue grew by 10.2 percent to Rs 4,082 crore, aided by volume growth. A CNBC-TV18 poll estimated profit at Rs 518 crore on revenue of Rs 4,021 crore for the quarter.

""The decorative business segment in India registered double digit growth during the quarter and international business performed well aided by good growth in markets like Nepal, UAE and Fiji,"" KBS Anand, MD and CEO said.

He expects a good monsoon and pay hikes for government employees to boost demand for decorative paints, saying the decorative paints market has picked up in the last three quarters.

Operating profit climbed 20.9 percent to Rs 820 crore and margin expanded by 180 basis points to 20.1 percent on yearly basis, aided by lower raw material prices despite higher promotional spends.

Brokerage houses are mixed on the counter as overall they waited for monsoon and 7th pay commission to reflect in earnings, though the company maintained double-digit volume growth when every single consumer goods firm is grappling with slowdown issues.

With retaining neutral rating as valuations remain stretched and raising target price to Rs 960 (from Rs 880 earlier), Credit Suisse increased its 2018 earnings by around 4 percent, given the clear commentary of improving volume trends and benign input costs but says the reason for pick up in volume is not clear as monsoon and pay commission are yet to play out.

""What is surprising is that Asian Paints is seeing such strong volume growth despite the overall weakness in rural demand for other consumer companies and two back to back failures in the monsoons. Triggers such as good monsoons in FY17 and the pay commission impact in urban home improvements are yet to play out, and even before that demand trends have picked up to strong levels,"" it explains.

The brokerage believes the strong volume traction will provide downside support to the stock. Asian Paints is going ahead with Rs 600 crore capex in FY17 to keep up with the high volume growth.

CLSA has retained high conviction sell on the stock, though it likes company's growth story and raised target price to Rs 925 from Rs 900.

GST implementation would be a key positive catalyst in the near term, as it should reduce the tax outgo and aid conversion from the unorganised sector, the brokerage said.Nomura feels the stock is expensive at 41.3x FY18 P/E. As crude prices start to rise, the brokerage house expects the margin expansion to fall in the coming quarters. It has retained reduce rating on the stock with target price of Rs 771.

Deutsche Bank has maintained hold rating on the stock with target of Rs 920 as it believes the stock is fully priced and target 35x P/E FY18 is appropriate.

According to the brokerage house, upside risk is faster urban recovery while downside risks are lag between input inflation and price increases. At 12:13 hours IST, the scrip of Asian Paints was quoting at Rs 1,133.00, up Rs 71.20, or 6.71 percent amid high volumes on the BSE.Posted by Sunil Shankar Matkar",572,0.8028086225191752

Buying stocks that can rise multifold in a short period is every investor's dream. But it is not easy to identify and buy such stocks at right time and exit at right time. Timing is the most crucial element in investing or trading. This timing can be known through financial astrology. Astrology is the only science which can predict future correctly & guide us about sectors which have to outperform.

Every year with commencement of new Samvat (Hindu New Year), astrologically, based on planetary position, certain new sectors start getting strong astrological support & start outperforming, while some others sectors which were performing earlier start underperforming. Some sectors/stocks remain laggards.

During last Samavat 2072 among other sectors – sugar & paper sectors received strong astrological support & outperformed. Many stocks from sugar sector appreciated by 600-900 percent. It should be recalled that sugar sector, despite strong, remained laggard for many years and started performing only after astrological support came.

Sectors which get very strong astrological support are not normally affected by downfall in the market.

The Cabinet has approved recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission benefitting over one crore government employees and pensioners. According to government officials, the cabinet has approved minimum pay hike of 20 percent and maximum pay hike of 25 percent.

Auto companies Maruti, M&M, Bajaj Auto and Hero MotorCorp are likely to benefit most with increase in government employee salaries in 7th pay commission. Historical analysis suggests that arrears and pay hikes lead to immediate spike in auto sales. After 6th pay commission, passenger vehicle sales rose by 19.5 percent to 2.22 million units in FY09 sales rose 19.5 percent in FY09 and 21.2 percent in FY10. Post 6th Pay Commission hike sales of two-wheelers rose by 16 percent in FY09 and 31 percent in FY10.

In an earlier note, Credit Suisse said that the 7th Pay Commission may translate into extra 10 percent growth for the industry. Analysts feel the new pay hike for government pay hike may boost consumption, reduce slackness in the economy and step up investment demand.

Banks too are likely to see strong credit growth especially for retail followed by corporate.

Consumer discretionary companies such as Bata India, Asian Paints, Voltas, Blue Star and Kajaria Ceramics are likely to see good growth. Also other sectors like FMCG and realty are expected to benefit from it.

The pay panel, in November last year, had recommended a 14.27 percent hike in basic pay at junior levels the lowest in 70 years. The previous 6th Pay Commission had recommended a 20 percent hike, which the government doubled while implementing it in 2008. The entry-level pay has been recommended to be raised to Rs 18,000 per month, from the current Rs 7000, while the maximum pay, drawn by the Cabinet Secretary, has been fixed at Rs 2.5 lakh per month from the current Rs 90000.Posted by Nasrin SultanaFollow @NasrinzStory",319,0.9999994337558746

""Britain is not going to cut off its links with the EU. It is not like it dies, it just disappears,"" Glassman says.

He believes global markets are adjusting to the new reality but are not freezing as was the case during the Lehman crisis. As long as global economy is on track, he does not see any reason for emerging markets to not perform well.

Asian Paints Ltd is investing around Rs 4,000 crore on setting up two manufacturing plants in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, although it has cautioned that demand conditions in the current fiscal ""still remain uncertain"" on account of the global economic situation.

Asian Paints chairman Ashwin Choksi said in the latest Annual Report that ""the company would be investing in phases at both these facilities to enable it to service the future demand adequately"".

The company has completed the land procurement process in both the states during the last fiscal and has taken possession of the identified land.

The report said the company will be set up a paint manufacturing plant with a maximum capacity of 4,00,000 kilolitres (KL) in phases at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh at an approximate investment of Rs 1,750 crore.

However, on June 21, it informed BSE that ""the company has re-looked at its product portfolio to be manufactured at this proposed manufacturing plant and has decided to revise its plans of setting up of the plant with a maximum capacity of 5,00,000 kilolitres per annum, to be put up in phases."" ""The approximate amount that would be invested by the company in phases over a period of 12 years from the date of commencement of construction, including the cost of land, would be Rs 1,785 crore,"" it said.

In addition, the report said, the firm will invest about Rs 2,300 crore to set up manufacturing facility with a maximum capacity of 6,00,000 KL in Mysuru, Karnataka.

Over the longer term, the growth potential for the company's various businesses is immense especially given the large impetus being put on infrastructure development and urbanisation through creation of smart cities.

""We are confident to convert this potential into reality and as a mark of this confidence, the company has initiated work on setting up new manufacturing facilities,"" Choksi said.

However, he cautioned that the demand conditions still remain uncertain in the financial year 2016-17. While the country continues to enjoy the benefits of a strong domestic consumption base, it cannot remain isolated from the external world where most of the large economies continue to exhibit weak growth trends.

The advance estimates for a good monsoon are encouraging signs and could provide a real push to the rural sector demand, he said.

During 2015-16, the company invested resources to augment its manufacturing capacities to be in a position to support the increased future demand in a timely manner.

The expansion project at Rohtak plant in Haryana to double the capacity from the existing 2,00,000 KL per annum to 4,00,000 KL per annum was successfully completed. The company would now be focusing on ramping up and stabilisation of output from the Rohtak plant, it said.

The modernisation programme at older facilities at Ankleshwar in Gujarat and Kasna in Uttar Pradesh have been completed in time last year, it added.",488,0.6428341666857401

Moody's said the asset quality of the banks will remain under pressure over the next 12 months and increased provisioning would constrain profitability and limit internal capital generation.

""In view of their results for the fiscal year ended March 2016, Moody's analysis suggests capital requirements of about Rs 1.2 trillion for its 11 rated public sector banks, far higher than the remaining Rs 450 billion included in the government's budget for capital distribution to the banks until 2020,"" it said.

SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com in an interview to CNBC-TV18 spoke on the sales number by auto companies. He said the sales numbers by Ashok Leyland were disappointing, while he sees more upside for SML Isuzu.

He also shared his views on Amtek Auto, Asian Paints, Adani Ports, the cement stocks and tractor manufacturers.

Below is the verbatim transcript of SP Tulsian's interview with Anuj Singhal and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18. Anuj: First a word on Ashok Leyland and the fact that it’s down 5 percent today, of course, a remarkably strong stock, but your first thoughts on the monthly sales number and the market’s reaction? A: If you see the company has posted the average monthly sales, I am referring the last quarter that is first quarter of 2016 or fourth quarter of FY16 they have posted a monthly sales average of about 14,000 vehicles per month. We have seen the disappointment in the month of April where the sales were at about 11,000, but this time sales having come below 10,000 is definitely a cause of concern because company has been on an upward trajectory and people have taken that 12,000-13,000 run rate of monthly sales is going to maintain by the company and that will give them a very big operating leverage, because of the high fixed cost and all sort of things, but yes monthly sales now slipping below 10,000 will be seen a disappointment, because this has happened continuously for two months for month of April it fell by about 3,000 vehicles on an average and now down by further 1,000 will be seen quite disappointment.

Sonia: Your other favourite SML Isuzu has done very well this month yet again. It is in the same space, ballpark, and the numbers are looking quite good. Would you buy this stock at this price or do you think it has run up a lot? A: These are excellent numbers are if you see these are the highest monthly sales posted by SML Isuzu and I wish to draw we discussed this in the morning when I said that I am expecting the sales numbers of SML Isuzu to come very good. If you see 1,400 were the numbers for the month of April and in fact sometimes when you analyse the numbers of SML Isuzu with Force Motors you feel that probably the share of Force Motors is eaten away by SML Isuzu and 1,900 vehicle sales in the month of May makes a total sales of above 3,300. Now if you see for March quarter they had a sales of about 3,500 vehicles for three months and already in two months they have achieved a sales of about 3,350. If I go by year-on-year (Y-o-Y) also always Q1 is the best number for the company on the monthly sales as well as on the financial performance. If I am again expecting similar kind of run I am not expecting 1,900 vehicles for month of June but definitely it is likely to be anywhere between 1,300 to 1,500. So, if you get to see the sales figure of about 4,800 the Q1 earnings per share (EPS) of the company will be seen at Rs 25 plus and that will be received very well by the market because people will now start taking a call on the profitability of the company from here on and that will be seen very positive with EPS of Rs 25.

So, I am expecting that probably we have a very good upside from here on because now the monthly sales number of June and then thereafter a call on Q1 numbers which as I said are going to be an excellent numbers with EPS expected to be of about Rs 24-25 for Q1.

Sonia: You heard what the Amtek Auto management had to say. Between last quarter and now there has been no progress on the deal closure although they are promising that things will take place within the next four to six weeks. You had recommended the stock a while back. Would you still keep the faith here? A: You are right and actually I recommended the stock and post that the stock has risen by about 50 percent and way above my target given about six months back. But If you really take a call on the management they are just repeating the same thing, debt of Rs 15,000 crore, monetisation of Tekfor, identifying the promoter, identifying the buyer, monetising the other assets also in India and abroad, expected to realise about Rs 7,000 crore. Earlier they were talking about Rs 10,000 but in today's commentary they said about two third of the debt will get reduced in next two to three years. That means they are talking of the debt coming down to Rs 4,000 crore but market has stopped believing the management and unless and until we see some concrete steps because if you recall alone Tekfor can see the debt reducing by about Rs 4,000-5,000 crore for the group because this Rs 14,800 crore debt stated by the management is a consolidated debt and in fact three or four companies all are victim of that.

Whether you include Castex Technology, Metalyst Forging, Amtek Auto or JMT Auto. JMT Auto is not as vulnerable as the other three companies are. So, yes, if these things will happen market will definitely be taking that with both the hands because it is a very good auto ancillary company though again management has posted cautious view on India but these companies, the Amtek Group has a very strong presence abroad. Maybe like you can call it as a mini Motherson Sumi kind of things but the debt burden, the results which we have seen of all these four companies for this March quarter was really horrible, the kind of exceptional and all that. So, yes, quick actions has to be taken and I wish that management stick to their commitment because management stick to their commitment because last time also four to six months back they were very categorical in saying that the debt monetisation will happen in next three to four months but nothing has happened and I recall at that time they had given an indication of Rs 7,000-8,000 crore mobilisation in next one year. We have already seen 6-7 months having elapsed. So, let us hope that this time deal happens in next 6-8 weeks and they are able to mobilise about Rs 4,000-5,000 crore and if that happens there will be a vast rerating of the stock because the company is backed by the asset. It is not like a case of JP Associate Group where the deterioration or asset valuations have fallen. They can recover this money, they have huge investments in India also. So, let us hope the management sticks to their plan of mobilising at least Rs 4,000-5,000 crore in next six to eight weeks for Tekfor. Anuj: The other stock that we have to discuss now is Asian Paints. Of course we discussed it a week back and from that point actually got even more expensive. Do you get a sense that it is time to just retreat from here and wait for correction before making fresh entry? A: That is right and in fact couple of days back only I have said that Rs 1,000 looks the March more valuations and you can call it as fully priced because probably now the momentum or the trading grip that is making the stocks to move up. Once you see the Q1 numbers definitely going to be disappointing I don't think that the same kind of growth can be maintained by the company. Yes, Q2 and Q3 will be a different story but market will not wait for four or five months to see that Q2 numbers. So, the stock has to take some profit booking and may have to correct to a level of Rs 970-975 and I won't be surprised to see that happening in this June series only. I am not saying that this stock will collapse, maybe everyday this stock is forming the higher bottom but the next support maybe seen at Rs 970-975 once that correction even takes place which is expected in this series and on a fundamental basis I won't give a buy call on this stock now. Anuj: A word on Adani Ports. That has been a phenomenal stock. I remember it used to be one of your big calls. You were bullish on Adani Ports. At Rs 202 how is the stock stacked up? A: That is right. In fact maybe when the stock was ruling at around Rs 230-240 and then when it went up to level of Rs 290-300 and during that time the buy call was given and even at the current rate of maybe once the stock corrected to the level of Rs 225 we again started giving a buy call and we continue to have a positive view because if you go by the financial performance and the growth trajectory which the company is posting expanding on both east and west coast those are since quite good but actually it is very unfortunate that in this last four or five months since its inclusion in the Nifty and Sensex this stock has been correcting since then.

Generally it is always the other way. When the stock is included in the main indices it always goes up. Then maybe with Q4 numbers once they are declared some kind of inter-corporate or maybe the group transfer of the money was raised as a concern by the market and that has made the stock to correct. But yes, at the current stage if someone has the courage to buy the stock with one year view I won't be surprised to see with a gain of about Rs 30-35 percent from the current levels. That means a target of about Rs 270-275.

Anuj: Any call on cement? Of course, you have had your favourites in the past but, ACC and Ambuja at current prices. Would you buy them? A: Ambuja, in fact has not participated in the cement rally to the extent which was warranted from that company, number one. Number two, ACC I see a lot of efficiency improvement to be seen in the performance of the company, maybe in terms of the margin expansion and all that. So, both the stocks from that point of view looks good because if you take a frontline stock like Shree Cements, UltraTech Cement or maybe Ramco Cements, because they are all 25 million plus category cement companies and Ambuja and ACC also, have the same kind of capacity of 30 million tonnes, So if you place them, probably both of them are looking quite cheap as compared to other three stocks which I mentioned. Sonia: The tractor sales for the month of May have looked very good. Mahindra and Mahindra tractor sales up 20 percent, Escorts tractor sales in double digit growth and we have some of these smaller companies like Swaraj Engines which have in any case been in the news on the upside. What would your pick of the pack be? A: You are right and actually we have discussed again that in the morning that M&M is going to perform or going to post very good numbers on the tractor front and rightly so they have posted a sales of 23,000 vehicles, 23,000 plus and actually I expect the same momentum to continue for June also because April, May and June or maybe May and June are always the best. Even coming on Escorts, the tractor number sales of about 5,000 plus, but if you take a call on the Swaraj Engines, they are reaching to their capacity utilisation to the full level. They are supplying closer to about 70,000 engines, if I am not mistaken. They have not been, because you may take a positive view on a quarterly results, but if you take a Y-o-Y result, I do not think that there is any kind of upside we have seen in the performance of Swaraj Engine. The stock has become quite expensive but yes, amongst the auto space, we have discussed a while back that SML Isuzu probably looks the best and then followed by maybe M&M. Even I will remain away from Escorts also because one has to see the valuation and also on those parameters, it is not seem to be too comforting.",2104,0.0

In FY11 when DMK was in power, its ad revenue growth was at 23 percent which fell to -2 percent in FY12 when Jayalalitha became the Chief Minister. Thereafter, Sun TV's ad revenue has never touched double digit growth except in FY13 hitting 11 percent. However, in FY14 ad revenue growth was at 1.6 percent.

The BJP’s victory in Assam will not help, as none of the seats (seven in the Upper House) are up for re-election until 2019. However, its improved tally in West Bengal and Kerala should help (although it depends on BJP’s final share of seats). Overall, if the exit polls are accurate, then the state election results could marginally improve the BJP’s seat tally in the Upper House, but the government will need to continue to build a consensus to push through legislative reforms in the Upper House (since its seat share remains under 50 percent ).""Don't miss: Modi magic!

Sebi filed a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing for registering an FIR against registrar and transfer agent Sharepro Services and 15 others - less than two weeks after the regulator had barred them from the securities market.

The complaint has been filed with regard to alleged ""forgery, cheating and misappropriation"" by these entities in connection with transfer of shares and dividends of various companies.

Sources said the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has filed a complaint with the EoW, Mumbai, against Sharepro and others. The watchdog has sought registering an FIR against them.

On March 22, the regulator had barred Sharepro and 15 entities from the securities market for indulging in illegal transfer of shares and dividend money of companies.

Sharepro Services (I) Pvt Ltd has been the registrar and share transfer agent for many top companies, including Britannia, Asian Paints, Tata Communications and Kansai Nerolac.

Besides imposing the ban on Sharepro and the 15 entities, Sebi had also asked the companies concerned to carry out a ""thorough audit"" of the records and systems of Sharepro to ascertain whether the dividends have been paid to actual holders and whether securities have been transferred as per the law.

The regulator had found that dividends and shares belonging to rightful investors were ""transferred to the persons related to the management of Sharepro"".

""Companies who are clients of Sharepro are directed to conduct a thorough audit of the records and systems of Sharepro with respect to dividends paid and transfer of securities to determine dividends have been paid to actual/ beneficial holders and whether securities have been transferred as per provision of the law,"" the order had said.

The audit would cover the dividends paid/transfers effected within the preceding at least 10 years. The companies have been asked to complete the audit in three months and submit a report to the regulator.

Besides, Sebi had said that the companies should take appropriate action within six months.

""Companies who are clients of Sharepro are also advised to carry out/ switchover their activities related to a registrar to an issue and share transfer agent, either in-house or through another registrar to an issue or share transfer agent registered with Sebi,"" the regulator had said.",382,-0.7894185483455658

Edelweiss's research report on Asian PaintsAsian Paints (APL) has ventured into the branded adhesives space with launch of 3 offerings—Loctite Quick, Loctite Rapid and Loctite Tough. The adhesives space is currently dominated by Pidilite (PIDI) with 70% plus market share and it has been successful in warding off competition from global behemoths as well as local players due to superior distribution and brand. Both of these may not be an issue for APL as the company can easily tap into its existing paint dealers (~36,000). However, APL will have to strengthen its network in kirana shops (sizeable sale points) which will be a key challenge for it. We perceive APL’s entry in the adhesives space as a strong threat to PIDI. APL is among our top picks and we retain our faith in the stock. Maintain ‘BUY’. APL remains key beneficiary of recovery in urban demand and GDP revival. Recent ~2% weighted average price cut across APL’s paint portfolio will help in maintaining double digit volume growth led by higher growth in the lower segment. The stock is trading at 37.8x FY17E and 31.8x FY18E EPS. We maintain ‘BUY/SO’ with target price of INR990.

""Companies who are clients of Sharepro are also advised to carry out/ switchover their activities related to a registrar to an issue and share transfer agent, either in house or through another registrar to an issue or share transfer agent registered with Sebi,"" Sebi noted.

Passing the order, Agarwal said that since the conduct of Sharepro, its promoters, directors, Vice President and other entities do not prima facie appear to be in the interest of investors and the securities market, ""necessary action has to be taken against them immediately, else it may lead to loss of investors' trust in the securities market"".",397,-0.9363244473934174

Moneycontrol BureauBritannia Industries has become the latest casualty of fraudulent practices at its share registrar, Sharepro Services. The fast moving consumer goods major is the third company to be hit after Asian Paints and Aptech.On Friday, Britannia informed the stock exchanges that it was terminating its agreement with Sharepro following “certain irregularities at Sharepro with respect to share related operations and dividend encashment activities.” the company has also filed a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW).And while the company did not give any further details, moneycontrol.com has learnt from a source that the value of shares and dividends illegally transferred from the accounts of bonafide shareholders to those of some Sharepro employees is around Rs 18-20 crore. The figure could not be independently confirmed with Britannia. The source said that Britannia had got consultancy firm EY to do a forensic audit of its shareholder list.In response to an e-mail questionnaire, EY said: ""As per our company policy, we cannot comment on specific companies.""Britannia did not respond to the e-mail on the issue sent to the agency handling its corporate communications.Sharepro is a SEBI registered Category I registrar to public issues and share transfer agent, and has been in the share registry business for over two decades.The Sharepro website claims Larsen & Toubro Finance Holdings, Bajaj Hindusthan, Hexaware, Ultratech Cement, Dena Bank, Bank of India, Zee, Godfrey Phillips, Mahindra Lifespaces, Abbot India, Clariant, Novartis, BASF, Balmer & Lawrie and Bombay Dyeing among its main clients.Strangely, there has been no action from the Securities and Exchange Board of India so far. Last week, Aptech had filed a criminal complaint against Sharepro alleging fraudulent transfer of shares. A week before that, Asian Paints had terminated its agreement with Sharepro, and sought the arrest of Sharepro's Managing Director GR Rao and Operations Head Indira Karkera for illegal transfer of the dividend and shares of some shareholders.In the First Information Report filed by Asian Paints at the Saki Naka police station, Asian Paints alleged that the shares of some shareholders were transferred to the accounts of Sharepro employees by forging documents and opening fake demat accounts, bank accounts and trading accounts. The value of the shares and dividends were just under Rs 2 crore.Sources said SEBI had asked Asian Paints to look into the matter after an anonymous letter tipping the regulator about the irregularities at Sharepro.",403,0.0

Shares of Asian Paints slipped 2 percent intraday on Monday due to price cut worries. Kotak has retained a reduce rating with a revised target of Rs 830 per share. The brokerage says that valuation of Asian Paints is quite expensive.

The paint company has cut prices by 2 percent across its decorative portfolio. Kotak finds this price cut move a tad surprising in the backdrop of the surge in several key paint inputs over the last few months. Hence, factoring in a price cut, Kotak has slashed FY2017-18 earnings per share (EPS) by 3-5 percent.

“We continue to bake in strong volume growth but find valuations at 35X FY2018 EPS expensive,” it says in a report.

In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Asian Paints said price cut was reduced due to lower commodity prices. The company does not see any volume pick-up post price cut and expects margins to reduce by 200 basis points.

At 13:27 hrs Asian Paints was quoting at Rs 855.25, down Rs 19.65, or 2.25 percent on the BSE.

Shares of Maruti Suzuki bounced back on Wednesday after shedding nearly 7 percent in previous four consecutive sessions. The stock gained 0.8 percent intraday today after resumption of production at its two facilities in northern India.

""Maruti has resumed production of vehicles at its facilities in Gurgaon and Manesar, starting February 23 (second half). The supply of components has started gradually,"" the country's largest car manufacturer said in its filing.

It had to suspend operations at these facilities from February 20 (second half) as supply of certain components was disrupted due to agitation in Haryana.

So far, due to disruption the company has faced total production loss of almost 10,000 units at its Gurgaon and Manesar plant, Kuldeep Janghu, General Secretary of Maruti Suzuki Udyog Kamgar Union said in an interview to CNBC-TV18 on February 23.

According to him, temporary disruption will not have any impact on company's sales.Not only Maruti but also Hero Motocorp, Asian Paints' production got affected due to Jat quota stir that started last week.

In January, Maruti's total sales declined 2.6 percent as lesser number of working days during the month impacted overall production and dispatch.

Competition Commission on Wednesday rejected a complaint of unfair business practices made against Asian Paints with regard to painting services provided for a house in Kolkata. This is the second time the watchdog is dismissing the same allegations made by the same complainant against the company. It was alleged that Asian Paints abused its dominant market position by not providing appropriate painting services and did not complete the works at a house in Kolkata, as promised through various advertisements.

Rejecting the complaint, Competition Commission of India (CCI) today said no additional material or evidences with the regulator has been submitted so as to draw a different conclusion regarding contravention of the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the Act. The complaint was made by one Belarani Bhattacharyya. ""As the facts and allegations remain the same, the commission is of the view that no case of contravention of any of the provisions of either section 3 or section 4 of the Act is made out against the Opposite Party (Asian Paints) in the instant case,"" the order said.

Section 3 pertains to cartelisation while Section 4 relates to abuse of dominant position. For this case, 'providing home solution services for painting homes in geographical area of Kolkata' was considered as the relevant market' by CCI. Bhattacharyya's first complaint against Asian Paints in 2011 was then rejected by CCI.

The complainant's appeal before the Competition Appellate Tribunal (Compat) was also rejected. Then, she approached the Delhi High Court, which had said that she may approach the Supreme Court against Compat order. After Bhattacharyya's review petition as well as an appeal to a different bench of the Delhi High Court were also rejected.

On CNBC-TV18's show Super Six, market gurus Ashish Kyal, Gaurav Ratnaparkhi and Aditya Agarwal, place their bets on two stocks each, thus offering investors a variety of options to choose from. Investors can read into the detailed analysis before agreeing to any or all the bets.Ashish Kyal of wavesstrategy.comThe first stock today is going to be a buy on Asian Paints. This stock has bounced back very sharply from the level of Rs 830 where it seems to have formed a very good base and it has also managed to cross above its 50 period early moving average. So one can buy Asian Paints with a stoploss of Rs 840 and target can be expected at Rs 915.The next call is going to be sell on NMDC. We have seen the pressure continued over the metal space and NMDC has given a negative close below the important pivot support, which was near Rs 93 levels. So the downtrend can continue in this stock and one should keep a stoploss of Rs 93 on upside and the target can be expected at Rs 85.Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of SharekhanI have a buy call on Shriram Transport Finance. The stock after a significant fall has taken support near a rising trendline drawn from crucial swing lows. At that support, the stock has formed a bullish inside barring the last session. The bullish formation has taken place on the backdrop of bullish daily momentum indicator. So the stock can attempt a decent bounce and equality target for the bounce will be Rs 898. Stoploss can be placed at Rs 839.Tech Mahindra is in a pullback mode from short-term perspective and the upmove is breaking up into lower degree base. Since last two sessions, the stock is in a consolidation mode and the consolidation is on the verge of a breakout on the upside. In the last session, the stock has formed an engulfing bull candle on the daily chart. Even the daily momentum indicator is in line with the bullish expectation. So I have a buy call on Tech Mahindra with a stoploss at Rs 535 and target will be Rs 568.Aditya Agarwal of Way2Wealth SecuritiesFirst call for the day will be a buy call in LIC Housing Finance. Around Rs 455, the stock has a strong support. 200 days moving average (DMA) also comes in the range of Rs 455 and from those levels, we saw some fresh long positions getting built up in F&O in yesterday's session. We are expecting that from these levels, stock may see a good pullback and on the higher side can test Rs 475 to Rs 480 levels. So one can go long in LIC Housing Finance at current levels keeping a stoploss of Rs 452.Second call for the day will be a sell call in Cipla. In this stock we are continuously seeing profit booking at higher levels in the range of Rs 660-665 and some profit booking is there. Yesterday it broke its support level of Rs 650 and it has settled below that. We are expecting the selling pressure may continue and on the lower side the stock may test Rs 630 levels. Keeping a stoploss of Rs 655, one can short Cipla keeping the target of Rs 630.",554,0.0

ICICI Direct's report on Asian Paints> Asian Paints (APL) recorded lower-than-expected sales growth of ~4% YoY driven by ~8-9% YoY rise in volume growth. The decline in realisation by ~4% was attributable to the price cut coupled with higher proportion of lower end products in sales volume> Titanium di-oxide prices declined ~8% YoY leading to saving in raw material cost to the tune of 260 bps YoY. The savings were partially offset by ~80 bps YoY rise in other expenses. As a result, the operating margin improved ~167 bps YoY. In addition, other income increased 20% YoY to Rs 57.5 crore mainly due to higher treasury income, which helped PAT to grow 15% YoY> We have modelled ~13% revenue CAGR in FY15-17E largely supported by ~11% volume CAGR and limited realisation growth largely on the back of a change in the product mix Strong fundamentals, revival in economy to drive valuationWe have modelled moderate revenue CAGR of 13% for FY15-17E led by volume growth of ~11% during the same period. We believe the company will pass on some benefits to customers considering the benign raw material prices. We estimate PAT CAGR of ~27% for FY15-17E due to an expansion in EBITDA margin by 307 bps in FY15-17E. Historically, during FY10, the company witnessed a sharp increase in gross margin on account of lower crude prices. We believe crude oil prices will remain at lower levels in the medium term, which will benefit the market leader as it is least likely to pass on the entire benefit of lower raw material prices. Also, high cash on the books could lead to an increase in dividend payout and improvement in RoEs. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 951/share (40x its FY17E earnings), says ICICI Direct research report.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Religare's Top Research Picks Top Research Picks Divis Laboratories (DIVI IN, BUY): First among equals – initiate with BUY Asian Paints (APNT IN, BUY): Q2 reels under sluggish demand; Buy on dips Bharti Infratel (BHIN IN, BUY): EBITDA miss led by lower energy margins Related stories KPIT Technologies (KPIT IN, HOLD): Stellar Q2 with rev/EPS beat; consistency key – HOLD Other Research Bajaj Auto (BJAUT IN, BUY): Q2 in line; all eyes on the Avenger facelift Symphony (SYML IN, HOLD): Volume growth recovers but priced in Godrej Consumer (GCPL IN, HOLD): Revenue miss but margin surprise; maintain HOLD

Divis LaboratoriesFirst among equals - initiate with BUYWe initiate coverage on DIVI with BUY and a Mar’17 TP of Rs 1,305. Global pharma outsourcing is treading a gradual recovery path and we believe DIVI will be the biggest beneficiary amongst Indian CRAMS players by dint of its strong IPR adherence and established relations with 20 of the top 25 global pharma majors. Its recent Rs 5bn capex plan imparts strong growth visibility and should support a 23% earnings CAGR over FY15-FY18. Valuations at 18x FY18E EPS are at a discount to historical averages and offer healthy upside.

Asian Paints Q2 reels under sluggish demand; Buy on dips Asian Paints posted a weak Q2 with 4%/16.7%/14.9% YoY growth in consolidated net sales/EBITDA/adj. PAT, even as domestic volume growth came in line at ~8-9%. EBITDA margins too disappointed (15.3% vs. RCMLe 16%) on an adverse product mix. While topline growth should recover to ~10% in H2 off a low base and festive sales, we pare our FY16-FY18 EPS to build in lower revenue growth this quarter. We restate BUY with a Sep’16 TP of Rs 935 (Rs 950 earlier) and recommend buying the stock on dips (Rs 800-825). Asian Paints

EBITDA miss led by lower energy margins

Bharti Infratel reported soft Q2 revenues up merely 3.7% YoY to Rs 30.4bn on a 5% YoY increase in tenancies. Consolidated EBITDA margins came in slightly below expectations at 43.1%, flat QoQ, dragged down by lower energy margins. Management commentary indicates that a pick-up in data growth would lead to acceleration in tenancy addition. While valuations are expensive, we continue to like BHIN for its strong market position, improving return profile and healthy balance sheet. Maintain BUY. KPIT Technologies

Stellar Q2 with rev/EPS beat; consistency key - HOLD

KPIT reported a strong Q2 with solid US$ revenue growth (+5.3% QoQ) and a massive EBITDA margin beat (13.9% vs. 9.5% estimated, +440bps QoQ) despite wage hikes. Management has guided for a soft Q3 with a rebound in Q4, and stable margins. Post the Q2 outperformance, we upgrade FY17/FY18 earnings estimates by 23%/20% and raise our Sep’16 TP to Rs 150 (from Rs 125), set at 9x fwd P/E. However, we would like to see a more consistent performance before turning constructive on the stock. Maintain HOLD.

Q2 in line; all eyes on the Avenger facelift

BJAUT’s Q2FY16 domestic realisations rose 4% YoY/10% QoQ due to a better product mix. Soft commodity prices pushed EBITDA margins up 120bps YoY to 21.6% (RCMLe 21.2%) and aided adjusted PAT growth of 4% to Rs 9.3bn (RCMLe: Rs 8.8bn). Management expects the upcoming launch of Avenger variants to translate into market share gains for BJAUT and is looking to exit FY16 with 21% domestic share, up from 18% in H1FY16. Export volumes are stable and should continue to lend margin support. Maintain BUY.

Volume growth recovers but priced in

SYML reported a good set of numbers with Q1FY16 net sales/EBITDA/adj. PAT growing by 24.5%/42.7%/33% YoY, as volume growth recovered to 18.7% YoY from a decline of 20.9% in Q4FY15. Adjusted for a change in reporting method, topline growth beat our estimates at 25.6%. Higher gross margins and lower staff costs led to sharp EBITDA margin gains of 380bps YoY/1,165bps QoQ to 29.7%. We remain positive on SYML but valuations appear full at 36.1x/27.1x FY17E/FY18E earnings. Maintain HOLD.

Revenue miss but margin surprise; maintain HOLD

GCPL reported Q2FY16 net sales growth of 9.5% YoY, 2% below estimates as domestic volume growth tapered down to 9% due to sluggish demand. EBITDA/adj. PAT grew 23%/24% YoY with EBITDA margins coming in above estimates at 18% (RCMLe 17.2%) aided by lower RM costs. GCPL’s India/ International businesses reported sales growth of 8.6%/10.6% YoY. We maintain our earnings CAGR estimate of 18% over FY15-FY18 but find valuations expensive at 38.4x/33.1x FY16E/FY17E EPS. HOLD.

For FY11- 13, revenue, PAT CAGR was 12%, 10%, respectively, supported by ~7- 8% volume growth. Despite an EBITDA margin erosion by ~142 bps due to lower operating leverage (higher fixed cost) and RoE on a declining trend, the stock has commanded average one year forward earnings multiple of 30x. However, we have revised our revenue, estimate downward by 3% and 4%, for FY16E and FY17E, respectively, considering passing on of benefits of lower raw material prices to customers. We estimate PAT CAGR of ~27% for FY15-17E due to expansion in EBITDA margin by 307 bps in FY15-17E. Historically, in FY10, the company has witnessed a sharp increase in gross margin on account of lower crude prices. We believe crude oil prices will remain at lower levels in the medium term, which will benefit the market leader as it is least likely to pass on the entire benefit of lower raw material prices. Also, high cash on the books could lead to an increase in dividend payout and improvement in RoEs. We reiterate BUY rating on the stock with a target price of | 951/share (40x its FY17E earnings).For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Government is likely to extend till June 2018 the validity of environment clearance (EC) given to Asian Paints - the country's largest paint maker -- for expansion of its Patancheru unit in Telangana. The EC, granted to Asian Paints in 2008 for expansion of its Patancheru plant, expired in 2013. During this period, the company could not expand the capacity due to some restrictions imposed by the state government.

""Asian Paints' proposal seeking extension of the validity of EC for its expansion project in Telangana was examined by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) in a recent meeting. It suggested for extension of the EC validity till June 2018. The final EC is expected to be issued soon,"" a senior Environment Ministry official said.

Asian Paints informed the EAC that the state government has lifted restrictions and the company is keen to start the expansion work, the official added. The company has proposed increasing paint production from 80,000 tonnes per annum (TPA) to 1,00,000 TPA and resins (emulsion) from 20,000 TPA to 30,000 TPA at its Patancheru plant located in Medak district. Asian Paints also informed that the effluent generation will be 111 m3/day, out of which industrial effluent will be 41 m3/day.

Industrial effluent will be treated and reused in process/cooling tower make and boiler feed. Sewage will also be treated and reused within plant premises. Asian Paints' current paint capacity in India is around 10 lakh kilo litres (KL) per annum, with paint manufacturing facilities at Patancheru (Telangana), Kasna (Uttar Pradesh), Khandala (Maharashtra), Rohtak (Haryana), Sriperumbudur (Tamil Nadu) and Ankleshwar (Gujarat).

Asian Paints, along with its subsidiaries, has operations in 19 countries across the world, with 26 paint manufacturing plants, servicing consumers in over 65 countries.",297,

ICICIdirect.com's research reportAsian PaintsAt this weeks low of Rs 778 the stock has tested its important support area being the confluence of 61.8% retracement of the June to August up move placed at Rs 780 levels and the long term rising 52 week EMA currently placed near Rs 770 levels. In the entire up move since August 2013, the stock has attracted strong demand upon testing its 52 week EMA on multiple occasions highlighting the overall bullish price structure.We believe the stock is attractively poised after the recent cool off which helped to work off the overbought conditions developed during June-August rise and provides the platform for resumption of the primary uptrend. We expect the stock to challenge its August 2015 life high of Rs 926 over the coming month thereby it offers a good risk reward set up to ride the next up move.Strategy: Buy Asian Paints in the range of Rs 780-803 for a target of Rs 925 with a stop loss below Rs 735 on a closing basisBharat ForgeThe share price of Bharat Forge has witnessed a sharp pullback from the lower band of the sideways trending channel in place since April 2015. It indicates strong demand emerging at the lower band of last six months consolidation offers fresh entry opportunity for medium-term investors.We expect the stock to resume positive momentum and head towards 1250 levels over the medium term being the upper band of the channel which also coincides with the 78.6% retracement of the entire decline from Rs 1339 and Rs 981 placed at Rs 1250 levelsStrategy: Buy Bharat Forge in the range of Rs 1055-1073 for a target of Rs 1250 with a stop loss below Rs 968 on a closing basisVardhman TextilesThe stock remains in a structural uptrend forming rising peaks and troughs on the long term price charts. While the benchmarks were subject to severe correction in last one month, during the same period the share price of Vardhaman textile has gradually retraced just 38.2% of its preceding up move (651-989) suggesting a healthy corrective phase. The shallow price correction against back drop of steep correction in many mid cap stocks including most of the textile peers, indicates lack of selling pressure and justifies the inherent strength in the stock.We believe the stock has concluded a healthy corrective phase and is set to resume its primary up trend. The price target of Rs 1057 is projected based on 138.2% retracement of recent correction (Rs 989-850).Strategy: Buy Vardhaman Textile in the range of Rs 895-905 for a target of Rs 1050 with a stop loss below Rs 830 on a closing basisFor all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

India's largest paint maker Asian Paints is looking to increase its capacity by 20 percent to 12 lakh kilo litres (KL) per annum by March 2016, which will be mostly powered by a doubling of capacity at its Rohtak facility, said company sources. The sources said the expansion would be driven by capacity enhancement at its Rohtak (Haryana) plant to 4 lakh KL from the existing 2 lakh KL. ""The expansion is expected to be completed by March 2016. The capacity of the Rohtak plant would be doubled to 4 lakh KL, from the current 2 lakh KL,"" the sources told agency. Asian Paints' current paint capacity in India is around 10 lakh KL per annum, with paint manufacturing facilities at Patancheru (Telangana), Kasna (Uttar Pradesh), Khandala (Maharashtra), Rohtak (Haryana), Sriperumbudur (Tamil Nadu) and Ankleshwar (Gujarat). The company is also in the process of scaling up its facility in Telangana by 25 percent to one lakh tonnes per annum.

According to the Expert Appraisal Committee under the Ministry of Environment and Forests, though the company obtained Environmental Clearance (EC) in 2008, it could not expand capacity due to the restrictions imposed by the state government. Asian Paints had earlier signed an MoU with the Andhra Pradesh government to set up a 4 lakh KL paint manufacturing facility at Vishakhapatnam district. An amount of approximately Rs 1,750 crore would be invested by the company in phases over a span of 12 years.

Asian Paints is also in discussions with Karnataka to set up another paint manufacturing facility in Mysuru district. ""Both these proposals for setting up manufacturing facilities in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are towards realising long-term capacity requirements and are subject to the demand conditions,"" sources said.

Dolat Capital's research report on Asian Paints

Q1FY16 volume growth was on low double digit at around 10-11% (11% growth in Q1FY15) ahead of our and street expectation. This growth has been on back of a sustained muted growth in the last two quarter.

Volume growth was on back of a strong volume growth in lower end paints categories. As a part of its strategy, the company has taken a price reduction in the lower end paints in March 2015 and increased its focus on these segment. We believe this could be to take on the players (unorganised and organised) which has a strong presence in this segment.

A double digit volume growth indicates a decline in realization of 4-5% (2% due price reduction and 2-3% due to mix change).

North and East continues to do better when compared to South and West.

Industrial business reported net sales growth of 13% this was driven by good growth in Auto (refinish and general industrial).

The company plans to setting up additional capacity in AP and Karnataka market. For FY16, the capex is expected to be Rs 7bn.

Valuations:""We believe Asian Paint is taking advantage of the benign RM cost scenario by reducing prices of lower end products as it already has a strong presence in the premium segment. We have revised our estimate to factor in a better operating performance. We estimate a 14% CAGR in revenue and 24% CAGR in earnings during FY15-17E. We believe, the P/E multiples remain high due to margin expansion. At CMP of Rs 815 stock trades at 43x FY16E EPS of Rs 18.9 and 36x FY17E EPS of Rs 22.7. We recommend Reduce with a price target of Rs 820"", says Dolat Capital research report.

Asian Paints, one of the country's largest paint companies, reported a whopping 34.4 percent increase in profit at Rs 455.18 crore in the quarter ended June compared to Rs 338.70 crore in the year-ago period.

Moneycontrol BureauIndian shares may open slightly higher, as expected by trading in the Singapore SGX Nifty (up 0.04 percent to 8,629) but equities will likely to cues from developments in monsoon session of Parliament that begins today and a waft of earnings declarations.Today's trade would come a day after the market opened higher but swung back in the red sharply before managing to come back above 8,600 and closing only marginally lower.This morning, Asian markets are trading with a positive bias though commodity plays were down following continuing weakness in oil, gold and metals. Overnight, Wall Street ended marginally higher.Closer home, analysts will keenly watch the opening session of Parliament to see if the ruling BJP government can make legislative progress amid much expected political posturing. Key bills such as on land law and goods and services tax, among others are pending, even though opposition parties such as Congress have pledged to disrupt proceedings related to recent allegations of irregularities concerning several leading BJP policymakers.Today will also be likely the busiest day in earnings: Nifty majors such as Infosys, HDFC Bank, HUL, Asian Paints and Cairn India are slated to post numbers.",202,0.5226545929908752

The market saw profit booking on Monday following a rally in three consecutive sessions as investors are cautious ahead of parliament monsoon session and key earnings viz Infosys, HUL, HDFC Bank.

Equity benchmarks trimmed losses in late trade, supported by HDFC Bank. The 30-share BSE Sensex fell 43.19 points to 28420.12. The 50-share NSE Nifty managed to hold the 8600 level, down 6.40 points to 8603.45.

However, the broader markets outperformed benchmarks with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices rising 0.3-0.4 percent. The market breadth was positive as 1543 advanced against 1285 shares declined on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

Though there was selling pressure today, experts still expect the market to go up further from current levels.

JP Morgan’s Head of Equity Research Bharat Iyer said the market has already discounted weak June quarter earnings and the progress on reforms is a big positive for the market. He expects another 10-12 percent returns on Nifty by end 2015.

Despite the recent rally in the market, Mithil Pradhan of Violet Arc Global Managers does not think it is the right time to go in for profit booking. He is extremely bullish on the market.

Meanwhile, the Monsoon Session of parliament will begin on Tuesday. Important legislations like the land bill, the GST Bill and the real estate bill may be discussed. Sources said the session is expected to be a stormy affair with Congress and other parties.

Infosys closed flat ahead of Q1 earnings. A CNBC-TV18 poll sees 2.5 percent sequential fall in profit and dollar revenue may grow 3 percent to USD 2,224 million in June quarter. HUL is expected to report a 5.1 percent growth in profit and nearly 8 percent rise in revenue in the quarter ended June. The stock declined 1.25 percent.

HDFC Bank rebounded in late trade, up half a percent ahead of June quarter earnings. Analysts expect numbers to be strong with the profit and net interest income rising 21 percent each. Asian Paints (up 3 percent), Cairn India (down 1.7 percent), Eicher Motors (up 0.9 percent) and Idea Cellular (up 1.5 percent) will also declare their earnings on Tuesday.

UltraTech Cement rallied more than 4 percent after its Q1 profit beat street expectations. Standalone profit came in at Rs 591 crore against forecast of Rs 549 crore and revenue grew by 7.1 percent, in line.

Among others, Tata Motors, State Bank of India, Vedanta, Coal India and BHEL declined 1-2 percent while Mahindra & Mahindra, Dr Reddy's Labs and Hindalco gained 1-2 percent.

On the global front, Asian markets were mostly higher with the Shanghai rising 0.9 percent and Nikkei up 0.25 percent. European markets like France's CAC and Germany's DAX gained nearly 1 percent.",453,0.2960284569046714

Despite the recent rally in the market, Mithil Pradhan of Violet Arc Global Managers does not think it is the right time to go in for profit booking. He is extremely bullish on the market. He is looking for a breakout in sectors such that PSU banks and IT that are not doing too well at the moment.

He recommends investors to continue to stay invested and buy on dips. He is bullish on stocks such as Cipla, Biocon, HUL, LIC Housing Finance and GIC Housing Finance. He also likes the midcaps space, especially names such as Arvind and PVR.

Market expert Shashi Bhushan advises investors to stick to largecap IT companies.

Post UltraTech Cement's first quarter numbers, Mayuresh Joshi of Angel Broking says he liked the stock at lower levels. He says the company's performance on the EBITDA front and bottomline was good. ""It was an all-round performance. But a lot depends on performance sustainability and what the management has to say,"" he told CNBC-TV18.

Joshi also likes Asian Paints despite the fact that it is expensive. He says the stock derives its valuation premium on the back of earnings and also being the market leader in the segment. He believes that the company will benefit from economic revival and capacity addition.

In the banking space, Joshi has a bias towards large private banks.

However, independent market expert Hemindra Hazari says if things stay the way they are and the economic revival takes more time and earnings don't revive any time soon, then the asset quality of private sector banks too will take a hit.",276,0.6000059843063354

Always be very cautious, when some main planets i.e. Rahu, Ketu, Jupiter & Lord Saturn are changing their houses. It may be that certain sectors which were continuously getting support for long time may stop receiving support due to change in position by above planets & stocks of those sectors starts coming down, resulting in losses.

Global uncertainty related to China’s market meltdown and the Greek debt crisis kept markets volatile for the entire week and the Nifty ended down 1.5 percent to close at 8,360. However, the magnitude of fall in Indian bourses was limited compared to European and other Asian markets as the Greek referendum turned out to be a non-event for domestic markets, where participants seem convinced on the decoupling theory.

Also, with China in trouble, it was believed that India would be the favoured destination of investors by default. Chinese markets, which had earlier lost nearly one-third of their value due to issues with margin financing, recovered 15 percent after its securities regulator artificially sucked out supply by banning shareholders with stakes of more than 5 percent from selling shares for the next six months.

Metals crashed globally on slowdown fears in China as the country accounts for more than 30 percent of global consumption. Precious metals followed suit. The crash in global commodity prices would force Indian producers to reduce prices, and export demand is also expected to be affected as surplus production by China would lead to aggressive dumping at low prices in various markets.

Looking at the intensity of the situation, the Indian government has stepped in with a proposal to make it mandatory for all public sector undertakings (PSUs) to source at least 35 percent of their steel requirements from domestic suppliers. If implemented, it will be the fourth major policy action to help the ailing steel sector over the last four months. Given rock-bottom valuations on account of the cyclical nature of the industry, it’s time for cherry picking in this sector.

In addition to weakness in metal stocks, companies having exposure to China in terms of revenue contribution also took a beating. Tata Motors fell on concerns of demand for the Jaguar Land Rover as China is its biggest market.

India’s industrial production grew by 2.7 percent in May 2015 against expectations of 4.4 percent, led by a sharp fall in capital goods and consumer goods data. This was despite better-than-expected core sector output. The key point to be noted is that the capital goods index, which has been an outperformer on expectation of a rebound in capital expenditure, may witness some pullback.

TCS kicked off the June quarter earnings season with results slightly below market expectations. With weak numbers already priced in for most companies, the IT earnings season may not create much hoopla as stocks have already corrected. Needless to say, if they manage to beat expectations, we could see them recover some of the losses.

Markets have entered the earnings season on a cautious note as weak demand outlook by most corporates have spooked investors. The focus will be on revenue guidance from company managements for the remaining part of the year and next year. The key results that will be declared in the coming week are from IndusInd Bank, Zee Entertainment, Mindtree, ACC, Kotak Bank, Asian Paints and CRISIL.

Among the global economic data expected this week is China’s Q2 GDP, to be released on July 15. The market is expecting GDP to fall to 6.8 percent from 7 percent, and a sharper-than-expected decline could result in panic, leading to another bout of selling.

Markets will also focus on Greece, with Athens offering to meet most of the demands made by creditors in exchange for a bailout of 53.5 billion euros ($59.4 billion). The EU summit on July 12 will be the last chance for both sides to reach an agreement. Failure to strike a deal could lead to a sharp sell-off in risky assets.

Overall, markets are expected to remain volatile. The Nifty has managed to hold on to the 8,350 mark so far. If the outcome in Greece is positive, we could see Nifty touch 8,500 yet again. On the other hand, if the Nifty breaks 8,250, we could see a fall to 8,000 levels again soon.

The weak IIP numbers have raised expectations of an interest rate cut by the RBI. One needs to see whether inflation data to be released next week supports the same.

We could be fooling ourselves with the decoupling theory in this connected world. Though the crash in commodity prices and uncertainty in global markets could prop up India as the favoured alternative destination, such a move does not happen overnight. The immediate investor reaction is of a “risk off” and we could witness that over the next few weeks.

Paints, aviation and tyres companies' stocks rallied 4-10 percent intraday Tuesday following decline in crude oil prices, the major component of their operating expenses.

Crude oil prices fell nearly 8 percent on Monday on global weakness post Greece voted 'No' to bailout package, continuing downtrend for the third consecutive session. WTI crude, the US benchmark oil price slid 7.7 percent or USD 4.38 to close at USD 52.53 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange and Brent crude, the global benchmark, lost 6.3 percent or USD 3.78 to USD 56.54 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Today both oil benchmarks gained 1-1.5 percent.

Volatility in Chinese stocks and likely rise in oil supply from Iran also added to the pressure on oil markets.

For tyre companies, 30 percent of raw material cost comes from crude derivatives that expenses form 20 percent of net sales. Accordingly, every 1 percent decline in crude prices can boost profit after tax of tyre companies by 2-2.5 percent.

In case of paint companies, softening of crude oil prices create margin tailwinds as oil constitutes a significant cost for most paints players. Falling in crude translates into softening for crude derivatives like Titanium Di-oxide and Rutile, the raw material for paint. Crude cushion will also help in lowering of freight costs for these companies.

For Asian Paints, 45-50 percent of raw materials are directly or indirectly linked to crude prices. In Q4FY15, gross margins expanded by 320 basis points Y-o-Y to 45.1 percent. For Berger Paints, crude & derivatives constitute 59 percent of cost of goods sold and its Q4 gross margins expanded by 330 basis points Y-o-Y.

As far as aviation companies are concerned, aviation turbine fuel constitutes major chunk of their expenses. Stocks have been rising on hopes that oil marketing companies may cut fuel prices after this correction in crude oil prices.

Oil retailers like IOC, HPCL, BPCL also gained 1-4 percent intraday, in addition to rally seen in previous session, as lower crude prices will aid margins for these oil marketing companies.",353,0.25900816172361374

9:50 am FII view: It is tough to find direct channels of contagion arising out of the debt crisis in Greece, as the international banking system does not have a big exposure to Greek debt, says Ray Farris of Credit Suisse.

But other softer problems remain, says Farris in an interview.

Nobody thought the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008 would eventually cause the global financial crisis, Farris says.

""Greece exitting the Eurozone may not be a big deal. But if markets respond poorly to pricing of similar risks for countries like Portugal, Spain Ireland over a period of time, there could be a problem,"" Farris says.

9:30 am Greece to hit rupee? The government is ""very closely"" monitoring the developments in Greece as that could have implications on the international currency market, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said. ""I think the Greece affair is going to play out for a few more days and we will certainly have to watch that...India's foreign exchange reserves are comfortable. The RBI and the government are very closely monitoring the developments. I think we have to be alert and keep watching what is happening,"" Sitharaman said.

After a massive rally in late trade yesterday, the market has opened with gains on Tuesday. The Sensex is up 85.75 points or 0.3 percent at 28294.51 and the Nifty is up 28.55 points or 0.3 percent at 8550.70. About 657 shares have advanced, 107 shares declined, and 59 shares are unchanged.

HDFC, Tata Steel Wipro, Cipla and Coal India are top gainers in the Sensex. Among the losers are Hindalco, Dr Reddy's Labs, Reliance, NTPC and ONGC. Asian Paints, BPCL are top Nifty gainers on weak crude prices.

Crude tumbled over 7 percent overnight amid the Iran nuclear deal negotiations, the Greece debt drama and volatility in Chinese stocks.

Nymex crude fell more than 7 percent to USD 52 per barrel after Greece’s rejection of debt bailout and China rolling out emergency measures to support its stock market. Brent crude fell 6.3 percent to USD 56.50/bbl, below 100 DMA, biggest slide in last three months.

Adding to the pressure on oil markets, Iran and global powers were trying to meet a July 7 deadline on a nuclear deal, which could add more oil to oversupplied markets if sanctions on Iran are eased. The self-imposed deadline could be extended again, officials at the negotiations said.

Asian markets are mixed bag after the sharp knock yesterday. Nikkei has bounced back smartly though the yen is hovering sub 123. The Kospi has come off 0.7 percent from day’s high while the rest of Asia is trading in the green.

US stocks closed mildly lower, recovering from sharp opening losses on selloff overseas, as traders shook off concerns of contagion from the Greece debt crisis. Bond yields held lower, with the 10-year yield near 2.30 percent.

In Europe, equities closed lower, after Greece voted ""no"" to reform proposals in the country's referendum on Sunday and the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis resigned. Peripheral indices suffered the most, with Italy’s FTSE closing around 4 percent lower.

Maximizer Jun 2015: Karvy

Indian equities started the year 2015 on a high note and rallied quickly towards the all time high levels in the first week of March 2015. However, selling pressurewas witnessed from those euphoric levels due to concerns over the pace of interest rate hikes in the US and worries over Greece exiting the European Monetary Union. On the domestic front, lag in earnings momentum catching up with the market run up led to disappointment during the quarterly results. All these factors led to markets giving up the gains of the last six months, giving an opportunity for fresh investments to enter the Indian equity markets. We retained eight out of ten stocks and replaced two stocks in our Wealth Maximizer 2015 due to expected under performance in the coming quarters.

Our take on the marketWe expect Nifty to trade in the band of 8400 – 10800 in the coming 12-15 months, implying a P/E band of 14-18x for CY16 consensus EPS. There could be short term volatility triggered by global events. We remain overweight on domestic consumption, Agri, Automobiles, BFSI, Cement, Consumer Goods, Infrastructure, Software and Pharma.

Wealth Maximizer Jun 2015: Our top ten large-cap picks in the Wealth Maximizer (for a time frame of 9-12 months) are Asian Paints, Divis Labs, HDFC Bank, ITC, L&T, Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, TCS, Ultratech Cement and UPL.

12:45pm Brokerage on ICICI Bank: CLSA has maintained its buy rating on the stock with target price of Rs 440 apiece.

Over FY15-18, the brokerage sees 17 percent CAGR in profit and improvement in asset quality that can drive re-rating of valuations (30-50 percent discount to private banks).

After analysing bank's FY15 annual report, CLSA said the key highlight is the focus on lending to higher rated corporates (including PSU) to de-risk balance sheet. Though this could be a headwind for margins, ICICI will benefit from strengthening of deposit franchise and rise in share of domestic loans, it added.

""Management highlighted plans to raise share of better rated corporate borrowers as well as public-sector enterprises in order to de-risk its corporate book; exposure to riskier sectors rose only 2 percent Y-o-Y in FY15. While yields on these loans are lower, transition could be neutral to NIMs as ICICI benefits from improving deposit franchise and rise in share of domestic loans,""it explained.

Retail segment continued to drive profits (up 50 percent Y-o-Y), while corporate struggled (-6 percent) due to slower growth and high credit costs. Consolidated profit was 10 percent above standalone and well-funded balance sheet of subsidiaries is helping them to repatriate capital.

12:35pm Market Expert: Better-than-expected monsoon, postponement of rate hikes by Fed and the reasonable MSP price hike are among the few positives that is likely keep Nifty in the vicinity of 8000 level, says Sachin Shah, Fund Manager, Emkay Investment Managers.

Brent August crude declined 18 cents at USD 63.69 a barrel after it settled 17 cents higher on Wednesday at USD 63.87.

Data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed crude inventories fell more than expected last week, but gasoline stocks rose by 460,000 barrels, more than analysts' expectations for a 314,000-barrel drop, according to a agency poll.

The EIA report also showed that operating capacity at US refineries fell to 93.1 percent last week from 94.6 percent.

12:00 pm Market Check

Equity benchmarks as well as broader markets continued to see buying interest and are heading towards higher closing for fifth consecutive session today. Oil & gas, banking & financials and auto stocks supported the market.

Moneycontrol BureauBrokerage house Nomura sees FMCG companies’ earnings growth stabilizing in the March quarter. Nomura also expects margins to improve on revival in urban demand and soft commodity prices.""After a couple of quarters of earnings disappointment, we expect Q4FY15F to be a quarter where growth would finally stabilise driven primarily by some recovery in the urban consumption even as rural growth remains slack,"" says Nomura report.According to the report, the average net sales for the consumer sector are expected to rise by 9.9 percent (Y-o-Y), EBITDA by 15.6 percent on the back of operating margin expansion of 115 basis points year-on-year (Y-o-Y) and net profit by 16% Y-o-Y.The house would keenly watch for the demand commentary by companies like Asian Paints, Jubilant Foodworks, Nestle, Bata, Titan and GSK Consumer and also watch out for the growth in the premium portfolio of HUVR and other staple companies“We expect companies in the mid-cap staples space, e.g. Godrej Consumer, Dabur, Marico and Emami to report stable revenue growth with some improvement in top-line growth on a sequential basis,” says THE Nomura report.Excerpts from the report“Key things to watch from the earnings season would be:1. Demand commentary: Management commentaries on how FY16F is shaping up in terms of demand and would look for how urban and rural demand has shaped up in 4QFY15. It expects a more constructive commentary on demand in this quarter versus in the past couple of quarters. 2. EBITDA margins outlook: Nomura thinks while EBITDA margins should improve Y-o-Y in 4QFY15F, the competitive intensity continues to be high. A&P investment across the sector is likely to remain at elevated levels. They also expect company management commentaries on the operating margins outlook into FY16F.”The brokerage expects positive surprises from Asian Paints and Godrej Consumer. However, it expects Jubiliant Foodworks and ITC to surprise negatively.

Business and economic cycles are strongly influenced by a country's political genealogy, says PhillipCapital. Though some critics argue that the government has achieved little, the brokerage house finds the mechanics of the government functioning to be sound.

India's business as well as economic cycles turned on sentiment (positive) though some critics argue that the government has achieved little, but PhillipCapital finds the mechanics of the government functioning to be sound.

The brokerage house, in a research report, says big bang reforms while awaited, the long-term growth prospects are set to improve as the focus of the government is capacity creation and improving the system efficiency with a spate of policies and reforms. Significant rise in government capital expenditure, lower inflation and trending down of interest rates are the most palpable outcomes over the near-to-medium term, says PhillipCap.

The brokerage house is introducing 'PhillipCapital Model Portfolio' based on the themes of the uptick in government capital spending, lower interest rates, strong dollar and pick up consumer discretionary spending with focus on value and mid-cap stocks. It is overweight on financials, autos, early cyclicals, pharmaceuticals and underweight on late cyclicals, tobacco and oil and gas.

According to the PhillipCapital Model Portfolio, FY16 will be marked by high degree of volatility and slowing foreign investments. However, valuations are likely to sustain with decreased cost of capital and improvement in earnings visibility,

Its top picks for the year are SBI, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, Coal India, Canara Bank, UltraTech, NCC, Biocon, Tech Mahindra, Dish TV, Maruti, Tata Communications, Kaveri Seeds, Trent and Asian Paints.

Excerpts from the report:

Onset of capacity creation after long phase of distribution: Many economists feel that UPA1's success was borne out of the policies of NDA1, which set capacity creation cycle in motion with public capital spending averaging at 28 percent of GDP, much higher than UPA1 at 23 percent, the adds says.

The cycle was augmented strongly by private investments in UPA1, leading the much-touted investment cycle of 2004-2008 and the key factor of UPA1's success. The FY16 Budget with 26 percent yoy increase in capital expenditure is indicative of BJP's policy framework based on capacity creation. PhillipCap believes that the present government's way of functioning will be similar to NDA1 and much will be achieved in reviving the investment cycle and improving long-term growth prospects.

Structurally a phase of low inflation; cost of funding to come down: The brokerage house expects 75 basis points reduction in interest rates in FY16 as compared to consensus expectations of 25 bps. ""While RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has a hawkish stance on inflation, but a closer look at historical NDA fiscal management policies indicate that inflation will remain structurally low,"" it adds. Maintaining a tight control on finances, reduction of subsidies, capex investments and curtailing of black money mean inflation will trend lower, according to the report.

Focus on efficiency with reforms: The four biggest reforms which have been touted as must-haves are: 1) Tax reforms, 2) Land acquisition, 3) Labour and 4) Irrigation.

Even as critics consider reforms process to be sluggish, PhillipCap says activity on all fronts has gathered pace with the conclusion of one of the most productive Parliament sessions.

Shares of Titan Company rallied 2 percent intraday Wednesday after brokerage Citi upgraded the stock to buy with increased target price at Rs 480 (from 470 earlier).

Titan’s stock has languished in recent months (10/13 percent underperformance compared to market/CNX Consumption Index since Q2 results), impacted by regulatory and specific issues.

Citi believes this remains a solid franchise, and risk/reward is turning more favorable (valuations around 25/35 percent lower than Asian Paints/Jubilant Foodworks) to the jewellery-to-watch maker.

""There are issues weighing on stock, but this could provide an opportune time to relook at a business with strong fundamentals. With soft numbers likely near term, we run risk of being early. But we think Titan's model is robust, seeing relative competitiveness post its calibrated expansion and ability to manage regulations and near-term issues versus peers,"" said the brokerage in its note.

""We draw confidence from resilience seen amid tough market / regulatory regime in past two years,"" the brokerage added.

According to the brokerage, sharp gold price fall and slower urban recovery will be downside risks.

At 10:54 hours IST, the scrip of Titan Company was quoting at Rs 418.50, up Rs 4.10, or 0.99 percent on the BSE.

Banking stocks led the rally ahead of the crucial RBI monetary policy next week.

The pull-back is on account of short-covering and fund inflows, said experts.

Top gainers of the week which rallied 5-10 percent over the week were: Idea, Sun Pharma, BPCL, Bharti Airtel, HDFC, Tata Motors, Asian Paints, BoB, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ITC. HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, Hindalco, Infosys were the prime Nifty losers, this week.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Asian Paints

""APNT’s management is optimistic on the medium term Decorative paints demand in India and is looking at double digit volume growth. Weak sentiments impacted demand in 3QFY15. While rural growth is still higher versus urban, the gap is narrowing. As per management, expectations of a price cut would not have resulted in any meaningful change in inventory levels in trade. We note that APNT has taken 2% price cut effective Mar 1, 2015 in its Decorative paints portfolio. Our channel checks suggest Decorative paint demand has improved QoQ.""

""APNT’s presence in the Home Improvement segment, via the acquisition of Sleek and Ess Ess, is gradually expanding. Both these brands were regional in nature, with predominant presence in Western and Southern geographies. APNT is planning to take these brands national and bring the service levels to its standards. Some of company’s dealers already retail home improvement products, and management is bringing the acquired brands into APNT’s network.""

Valuation and view: ""We estimate 31% EPS CAGR over FY15E-17E, with underlying gross and EBITDA margin expansion of 420bp and 390bp, respectively. While improving macros and consumer sentiment should drive volume growth going ahead, valuations at 39.2x FY16E and 32x FY17E discount the positives, in our view. Maintain Neutral with a target price of INR900 (35x FY17E, three-year average P/E)"", says Motilal Oswal research report.

Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on Asian Paints but slashed target price by 4 percent per share as demand recovery and margin gain quantum is likely to be lower in fourth quarter of FY15. The brokerage is cautious that fourth quarter volume recovery is not as strong as expected, which implies likely mid-single digit volume growth.

“Paint dealers were anticipating a price cut over the past few months, which has now materialised in the form of 2 percent in price cut taken by Asian Paints. However, there is no material elasticity in demand,” it says in a note.

However, Credit Suisse is hopeful that Asian Paints will gain from falling input costs in FY16, as 50 percent of the input basket is crude linked and 20 percent is titanium dioxide. There may be, the brokerage adds, a time lag in the gain from falling crude prices, as derivative prices are falling with a lag, excluding MTO and monomer prices, which are falling by a smaller amount.

The brokerages expects volume growth to recover in FY16 to double-digit levels, and build in 3-5 percent price cuts, which would still leave room for 500 basis points expansion in EBITDA margins.

At 12:54 hrs Asian Paints was quoting at Rs 808.55, down Rs 5.60, or 0.69 percent on the BSE.

ICICIdirect.com's report on Asian Paints

The fall in crude prices of over 60% since the start of 2014 has been one of the most beneficial themes for the Indian economy. Not only has it improved the country’s current account deficit (CAD) but also helped to cool off inflation. This has been one of the key drivers of the strong Nifty price performance as well. The impact is even more significant for companies that have oil as one of the key inputs for production. Asian Paints is one such stock, which is a direct beneficiary of a fall in crude prices, as it uses Titanium Dioxide, the price of which corrected over 11% in 2014

The stock posted soft Q3 quarterly numbers on January 29, post which it corrected over 15% from the highs of Rs 922. However, with crude prices likely to remain weak and the likely impetus on smart cities and infra projects in the Union Budget, the stock is likely to see a pick-up in business

The break out level was Rs 800 in the last up move for the stock. In the current decline, post results, the stock saw a pick-up in delivery volume near Rs 800, post which the stock held around these levels and started to move up

In open interest terms, the stock has seen a creation of short positions of over 25% post the quarterly results on January 29. However, as the stock found support near Rs 780, these short positions started to see closure. However, a bulk of these short positions are still intact in the counter and could propel further upsides

As the Nifty is currently in consolidation mode, the focus is coming back to the consumption theme and the space is attracting money flows. The stock has a beta of 0.65 (in trailing one year), which suggests it could remain insulated from sharp declines in case the broader market declines

Hence, we recommend buy on the stock with a target of Rs 995 and stop loss of Rs 738, with 200 DMA being near Rs 740. Further, the three month average stock price is also near Rs 800, which remains an immediate support

Recommendation time horizon: Three months

The Greek market closed higher by 8%.There is speculation that the European Commission could be ready to table a compromise on Greece’s bailout programme and propose a six-month extension to the country's bailout which is due to end on February 28.Investors will be keenly watching for a possible Greek debt deal when the euro group of finance ministers meets in Brussels today where Greece’s finance minister is expected to detail new reform proposals.In the currency space, the dollar hovered at one-month highs versus the yen, bolstered by gains in treasury yields, while uncertainty over a new debt deal for Greece kept a cloud over the euro.From the commodities space, crude prices slipped after the international energy agency warned that oil prices may decline as stocks continue to increase this year. Brent crude slips to 56 dollars per barrel. And the precious metals gold slipped marginally following a rise in dollar.Meanwhile, back home some of the stocks that could be in focus are DLF, BHEL and Asian Paints.

03:30 pm Market close

The market ended at record closing high on expiry of January F&O series. The Nifty ended at 8952, up 38.05 points while the Sensex was up 122.59 points at 29681.77. Top gainers in January series were DLF (up 26.6 percent), Tata Motors (up 24 percent) and Axis Bank (up 21 percent). Nifty gained 9.5 percent while Bank Nifty surged 10.7 percent in the series.

In today's trading session, Dr Reddy's Labs, HDFC Bank, BHEL, Reliance and ITC were top gainers in the Sensex. Among the losers were HDFC, SBI, M&M, Coal India and Maruti Suzuki.

03:10 Rights issue

Tata Motors intends to utilise Rs 7,500 crore, which it plans to raise via a rights issue, to fund various activities, including introduction of more than 100 new commercial vehicles over the next three years and passenger vehicles on a new modular platform from FY 2016-17.

The company, which is seeking shareholders’ approval through postal ballot for raising funds up to Rs 7,500 crore through a rights issue of ordinary shares, also intends to use the funds to expand in international markets.

“The rights issue proceeds are expected to be utilised to finance a portion of the ongoing capital expenditure, including product development expenses; invest in subsidiaries to support future growth opportunities in India and abroad,” Tata Motors said in a filing to the BSE.

2:55 pm Royalty restrictions?

The Finance Ministry has turned down a DIPP proposal seeking re-introduction of restrictions on royalty payments for preventing excessive outflow of foreign exchange, saying it would send a negative signal to overseas investors.

The ministry, according to sources, is of the view that imposing restrictions on royalty payments will be ""retrograde step"" and not in sync with the liberalised FDI policy environment. Worried over excessive outflow of foreign exchange as royalty and fees for technology transfer, and use of brand names, the Department of Industrial policy and Promotion (DIPP) had mooted a proposed to re-introduce restrictions on such payments by foreign companies to their parent entities.

02:40 pm Results

Commercial vehicle maker Ashok Leyland turned profitable in the quarter ended December 2014. Net profit for the quarter stood at Rs 32.1 crore against loss of Rs 167.2 crore in the year-ago period. Higher other income and lower finance cost supported the profitability but tax cost restricted profit growth.

Topline and operational performance beat street estimates while the bottomline slightly missed expectations. Profit was expected at Rs 35.8 crore on revenue of Rs 3,195 crore for the quarter, according to the average of estimate of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Revenue shot up 72.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,361 crore, driven by strong sales volume growth.

Total volumes during the quarter grew 38 percent on yearly basis to 25,397 units led by medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) sales. MHCV volumes saw a solid 70 percent growth while light commercial vehicle sales declined 8 percent Y-o-Y.

02:30pm Adani Enterprises in focus

Adani Enterprises plans to announce a mega restructuring plan tomorrow reports CNBC-TV18’s Varinder Bansal quoting sources.

The restructuring is mainly to remove the holding structure and then focus on the core business of the left entity, which would be mining, trading, agri, logistics etc.

The current market cap of Adani Enterprises is Rs 65,000 crore because it owns 74.99 percent in Adani Ports and 68.99 percent in Adani Power.

Post the restructuring process, the company is also looking at raising funds.

Post restructuring, analysts do not expect a huge upside for the stock from current levels but it will undoubtedly be a clean structure.

02:00pm Market Check

Equity benchmarks as well as broader markets continued to consolidate on expiry day for the January derivative contracts. Weak global cues and expiry factors kept markets subdued.

The 30-share BSE Sensex fell 101.55 points to 29457.63 and the 50-share NSE Nifty declined 31.95 points to 8882.35. About 1290 shares have advanced, 1475 shares declined, and 260 shares are unchanged on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

Manish Gunwani of ICICI Prudential AMC expects a correction or minor consolidation in the near term. However, the market looks good with a 2-3 years perspective, he say.

Global markets are weak today. Asian markets like Shanghai closed with losses of more than 1 percent while European equities like FTSE traded down more than 0.5 percent as oil declined and Greece weighed. NYMEX crude traded at USD 44 a barrel, the lowest level since March 2009.

Telecom stocks like Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular are under pressure after the Cabinet approved 3G auction reserve price at Rs 3,705 crore which is 36 percent higher than the TRAI recommendation and 10.6 percent higher than the previous 3G auction held in 2010.

In key earnings reactions today, Asian Paints disappointed after Q3 profit rose 12 percent, lower than expectations of 30 percent growth. The stock fell 3 percent. HDFC dropped over 2 percent after the housing finance company reported 11.5 percent growth in profit, in line with estimates. However, Dr Reddy's Labs reported a 7 percent fall in profit in Q3, which is higher compared to expectations of 14 percent decline.

Asian Paints, the largest paint company in India, missed street expectations on all parameters on Thursday. Consolidated net profit increased 11.8 percent year-on-year to Rs 368.2 crore in the quarter ended December 2014, impacted by single digit volume growth in decorative paint segment.

""We registered single digit volume growth in the decorative paint segment in India due to sluggish demand conditions. Growth in Q3FY15 was also affected due to the early festival season as compared to the previous year,"" said KBS Anand, managing director & CEO of the paint company.

Profit was expected at Rs 428 crore on revenue of Rs 3,979 crore for the quarter, according to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Consolidated total income grew 5.8 percent to Rs 3,652.6 crore in December quarter from Rs 3,451.9 crore in the year-ago period.

Operating profit rose 8.6 percent on yearly basis to Rs 583 crore and margin expanded 40 basis points to 16 percent in the quarter gone by, which was expected at Rs 658 crore and 16.5 percent, respectively.

KBS Anand further said the automotive coatings JV witnessed good growth in the general industrial and auto refinish business segment. However, the auto OEM business was affected by subdued consumer demand, he added.

""The growth in industrial coatings JV was led by demand in the industrial liquid paints segment. International business performance was led by double digit growth in some markets like Bangladesh, Nepal & Emirates even though some countries continued to be affected by political events and macro-economic uncertainty,"" said Anand.

Other expenses increased 15.5 percent year-on-year (down 3.8 percent sequentially) to Rs 785.5 crore and raw material cost declined marginally (down 15.7 percent Q-o-Q) to Rs 1,841 crore from Rs 1,845 crore on year-on-year basis.

The sequential fall in raw material cost was due to decline in crude oil prices. Titanium dioxide is the key raw material for paint companies and the same is derived from crude oil. Brent crude oil prices plunged more than 50 percent since June 2014, trading at around USD 49 a barrel currently.

At 13:11 hours IST, the scrip of Asian Paints was quoting at Rs 879, down Rs 31.30, or 3.44 percent on the BSE.",380,0.22590307146310806

Asian Paints, the largest paint company in India, is likely to see better profitability in Q3 due to favorable raw material costs. Consolidated profit is expected to rise a healthy 29.8 percent year-on-year to Rs 428 crore during October-December quarter, according to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Titanium dioxide is the key raw material for paint companies and the same is derived from crude oil. Brent crude oil prices plunged more than 50 percent since June 2014, trading at around USD 49 a barrel currently.

The combination of lower interest cost and higher other income could fuel net income growth in Q3, say analysts.

Total income of the paint company is seen rising 15.3 percent to Rs 3,979 crore during October-December quarter from Rs 3,452 crore in the year-ago period.

Operating profit may jump 22.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 658 crore while margin may expand 100 basis points to 16.5 percent during the quarter, driven by lower input costs and ongoing operating leverage.

Analysts say advertising spends, which were high in Q2FY15, are likely to normalise during the quarter that may also aid margin.

International business is likely to report mixed performance with continued outperformance by the Middle East and Asia. Analysts expect healthy growth trends in South East Asia.

Meanwhile, today Credit Suisse upgraded Asian Paints to outperform from neutral and upped target price from Rs 710 to Rs 1,020 apiece as the brokerage sees a very favourable input cost scenario in FY16.

""Over 50 percent of input costs are directly/indirectly related to crude prices while almost 20 percent of input costs is titanium dioxide, prices for which are also coming off,"" say the brokerage. adding if crude price was to sustain at current levels of around USD 50 a barrel, the upside on margins could be higher.",313,0.779596381717258

Shares of Asian Paints surged to record high at Rs 916.95, up 3 percent intraday on Wednesday after Credit Suisse upgraded it to outperform from neutral rating. The brokerage has also raised target price to Rs 1020 from Rs 710 per share.

Credit Suisse has increased earnings estimates by 20 percent considering crude is at USD 58/ bbl in 2015 and USD 75/bl in 2016. According to it, the company has major margin tailwinds and a very favourable input cost scenario in FY16 as over 70 percent of the input cost basket is trending downwards.

“Over 50 percent of input costs are directly or indirectly related to crude prices. Almost 20 percent of input costs is titanium dioxide, prices for which are also coming off,” it said. Titanium dioxide, a key raw material for paint companies, is derived from crude oil.

Crude-oil prices have slumped after OPEC decided at its November meeting not to cut its output despite a combination of a global supply glut and lackluster demand.

At 11:42 hrs Asian Paints was quoting at Rs 916.85, up Rs 26.70, or 3.00 percent on the BSE.

While the market may be worried about fiscal stress in FY15, brokerage house house Credit Suisse government can raise capex by at least 1.2 percent of GDP in FY16.

“The gains pocketed from falling oil prices could be used for counter-cyclical pump-priming. A further 0.9 percent of GDP can come from the new GDP series and a slight push-out of deficit targets,” the brokerage said in its note to clients.

“This fiscal expansion could drive a 0.75-1.00 percentage point addition to growth, driving outperformance of the broader India market. In particular, rising expenditure on roads and housing should drive a pick-up in cement and paints demand,” the note said.

From the sidelines of the World Economic Forum at Davos, KBS Anand, MD & CEO of Asian Paints spoke to CNBC-TV18's Menaka Doshi on the impact of lower crude prices and growth outlook for the company and industry going forward.According to him FY16 is likely to show improvement in topline if government follows through with the reforms. So the growth in FY16 could be incrementally better than FY15, said Anand. While, FY15 growth would be similar to that of FY14, he addedWith regards to the fall in commodity prices, he said they would help increase earnings power of companies overall. ""So when the economy grows faster, I think all consumer companies will do better, demand will increase and as a result we should do better,"" he said.

Below is the transcript of his interview to CNBC-TV18Q: What is the impact of lower crude prices on Asian Paints?A: The fall in crude prices and commodity prices will definitely increase the earning power of companies and people across the country. Hopefully that should have a gross domestic product (GDP) multiplier effect. So when the economy grows faster, I think all consumer companies will do better, demand will increase and as a result we should do better. On the other side, commodity prices especially crude coming down definitely helps our bottomline and our profitability improves. But in a competitive scenario in the long run, you have to probably handover some of it to the consumers.Q: What is the year 2015 or FY16 however you choose to pick it looking like in terms of consumer demand in India?A: Everybody is hoping for ‘Acche Din’ because with the government moving everybody is optimistic and Indians are probably the most optimistic people in the world.Q: So does it look like ‘Acche Din’ will come your way in 2015 or are you gauging that consumer demand is a little bit more tepid than anticipated?A: It is going to take time for any action by the government to translate down to the ground level but the stock markets definitely indicate that the consumer demand is going up.Q: You have an ear closer to the ground than the stock market does.A: I am in a quiet period.Q: I am not asking you for a quarterly number, I am not even asking you to quantify this specific growth number for me but give me a sense, is this year either the calendar year or FY16 going to look like a big improvement in topline versus the year that has just gone by?A: It should show an improvement in the topline if the government carries out half the things they say they are going to.Q: Single digit improvement, double digit improvement for topline growth?A: We have been having double digit growth for the last decade and a half.Q: Will growth be dramatically better or will it be just incrementally better?A: I think it will take time to be dramatically better.Q: So incrementally better in 2015 the calendar year and equally in FY16 so to speak, right?A: 2015 maybe similar to 2014 if we are talking of the financial year.Q: 2015 financial year - we are in the last quarter now.A: So probably if you see the first half yearly results, they are very similar to what was there the previous year. So it is more or less on similar lines.Q: In the years FY09 to FY14 and I was reading a research report in anticipation of this interview, you moved your profitability, your margin up by almost 300-400 basis points this even at a time when inflation posed a big problem, now that seems to be a less of a problem, we may have seen the beginning of a rate down cycle so to speak given the RBI’s recent actions, you have got this big cut in crude prices that is overwhelming all of this. So I am trying to gauge whether profitability that is your margins will grow by substantially more in the next five years to come?A: Competition won’t allow that. We are in a fairly competitive scenario; all the leading paint companies of the world are there in India, so margins will increase a bit but I don’t think they will shoot up or down. Anyway, we play for a more consistent long-term scenario, we are looking at long-term growths over the next decade or so, so we aren’t very worried about one-year shoot up or shoot down.",750,0.0

Shares of Jet Airways jumped 5 percent intraday on Tuesday as Brent crude prices fall below USD 47/barrel which is the lowest level seen in the past six years after Goldman Sachs slashed its three-month forecasts for Brent crude to USD 42/barrel.

Goldman Sachs slashed its oil forecasts saying fuel prices needed to stay low for much longer in order to curb production and end a global supply glut.

Goldman Sachs oil analysts led by Jeffrey Currie said the collapse in oil prices over the last six months, which has brought North Sea Brent crude down almost 60 percent to below USD 50 a barrel, would eventually balance the market.

However, it said crude oil prices could come down much further in the short term, possibly into the high USD 30 a barrel before the market saw a rebound.

""To accommodate the substantial expected first half inventory build and using the storage arbitrage to the one-year ahead swap, we are revising down our 3, 6 and 12-month price forecasts for Brent to USD 42, USD 43 and USD 70 respectively, from USD 80, USD 85 and USD 90,"" the bank said in a report to clients.

Meanwhile, paint companies are also seeing buying interest as crude is one the main raw material for the industry.

At 10:34 hrs Jet Airways was quoting at Rs 460.55, up Rs 18.90, or 4.28 percent and Asian Paints was quoting at Rs 837.85, up Rs 30.50, or 3.78 percent on the BSE.",258,-0.9982090950012207

Prabhudas Lilladher's report on Asian Paints

""APNT is one of the biggest beneficiaries of low crude prices as crude linked raw materials (including packaging) are 57% of input costs. We expect strong margin expansion for the coming couple of quarters, however extrapolating the same to FY17 looks too premature, given uncertainty regarding global crude oil prices. APNT had cut prices by 10% in 2009 and margin expansion in that cycle was led by excise duty reduction and acceleration in volume growth. We expect price cuts to materialise from 4QFY15. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that there is high probability of 40% EPS growth in FY16 whereas FY17 growth would be lower than current estimates due to higher margin in base quarter. We would wait for management commentary on product pricing and trend in crude oil prices before changing our estimates. We believe APNT is in a sweet spot due to huge growth opportunity in decorative paints given strong brand, distribution and innovations. We currently estimate 24% PAT CAGR over FY14‐17 and 21% PAT CAGR over FY15‐17. Retain Accumulate with a target price of Rs 747"", says Prabhudas Lilladher research report.

Leading domestic paints maker Asian Paints is yet to secure land for its third plant in South India that could entail a tentative investment of Rs 2,500 crore.

""I am not going to speak about the exact location of the project as long as I am not getting the land. I can only say it will be in South India and it will be 6 lakh KL capacity plant and the investment will be Rs 2,500 crore,"" Asian Paints Managing Director and CEO KBS Anand said here on Friday.

According to reports, Asian Paints was trying to build a 6 lakh KL per year capacity decorative paints in Karnataka near Mysore but land acquisition of 130 acres, needed for the project, ran into trouble since 2013. Anand said he believed in actual possession of land and till then agreements and assurances made no meaning. Asian Paints has two plants near Hyderabad and Chennai.

He said the company was facing trouble in getting environmental clearance for expanding Hyderabad facility and the issue was discussed with the Indian Paints Association in a meeting here today. The paint major was also planning to enter Indonesia with 25,000 tonne per annum capacity. ""We just got approval for the project to form the company and now we will have to acquire land and then environmental approvals,"" Anand said when asked when he was expecting Indonesian plant would be operational.

Asian Paints was not considering any plant immediately in eastern India because of being a small market and also for land and power issues. The company indicated that there was no immediate plans to cut paint prices due to easing of crude price.",287,-0.8758080899715424

Shares of Berger Paints and Asian Paints were up 4-10 percent (respectively) intraday on Thursday. Macquarie has initiated coverage on both the stocks with outperform rating. It expects Berger Paints to touch Rs 509 calling it a challenger in the Indian paints market and thinks that its investment in advertising &promotions and capacity will pay good dividends.

""We expect Berger’s gross margins to expand by 200bps over FY15-17E due to lower crude prices. Combination of higher margin premium product, lower crude prices and operating leverage can aid a 220 basis points improvement in EBITDA margin in FY15-17E,"" it elaborates in a report.

Buying interest is seen in Berger also because it turned ex-stock split in the ratio of 2:1 today. Shares having face value of Rs 2 will be divided into two shares of Rs 1 face value.

The company has fixed January 09, 2015 as the record date for the purpose of sub-division of equity shares of face value of Rs 2 into Equity Shares of face value of Re 1 fully paid up, Berger Paints said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Macquarie expects Asian Paints to grow faster (18.8 percent revenue CAGR over FY15-17E) than the industry (16.7 percent CAGR over the same period) given its size and its focus on advertising, promotion and distribution.

It has a target price of Rs 923 per share, indicating a 20 percent potential upside.

""Key risks for Asian Paints are large investments in unrelated businesses; slower-than-expected GDP recovery in India would result in slower revenue growth and a sharp recovery in crude prices or a sharp fall in the Indian rupee against the USD can impact margins,"" the brokerage adds.

At 13:22 hrs Berger Paints India was quoting at Rs 234.85, up Rs 17.22, or 7.91 percent while Asian Paints was quoting at Rs 802.20, up Rs 29.90, or 3.87 percent on the BSE.

11:30 am Truce: Coal India unions, protesting against a move to open up the industry to private firms, called off a five-day strike on its second day on Wednesday after a meeting with the coal and power minister, staving off a looming power crisis.

The company accounts for about 80 percent of India's total output and strikes have previously crippled power plants, hampering government efforts to reform the coal industry. Coal fuels 60 percent of the country's power production.

Coal India struggled to produce and ship less than half of its daily target on Tuesday, the first day of the strike, threatening to exacerbate a shortage of the fuel.

A union leader said they decided to end the strike late on Wednesday after minister Piyush Goyal agreed to form a committee to look into any issues with a recently passed executive order, which would allow private companies to mine and sell the fuel for the first time in 42 years.

Top 10 largecap picks for 2015 by Karvy

Stellar Performance of Indian Equities

Indian equities had outperformed major global indices, barring China during CY2014, mainly driven by MODIfied political and investment scenario. Among the domestic factors, Lok Sabha elections 2014, in which BJP under the leadership of Mr Modi had got the decisive mandate removing the political uncertainty and brought hopes for good governance. Sharp drop in crude oil prices and stronger rupee had improved fiscal health and led to a turnaround in Indian macros. Globally, steady recovery in the US economy had led to the US Fed ended the QE and readying for increase in interest rates, confirming the healthy recovery in the worlds’ largest economy.

Our Wealth Maximizer 2014 performed well with Nine out of ten stocks exceeding the targets. We retain six out of the ten stocks and replaced four stocks due to expected under-performance in the next few quarters.

Outlook for 2015Economic growth to reach 6.5%-7.0% during 2015 driven by good governance under the leadership of Mr. Modi: During the year 2015, Indian economic growth could be driven by reform momentum. The government has taken the initiatives to introduce GST, land acquisition amendments, insurance sector reforms and coal blocks auction bills. Under the ‘Make in India’ campaign, Govt is opening opportunities for domestic manufacturing in Defence, Electronics Hardware & Medical equipment from the 25 sectors identified to be given priority. The ordinance route chosen by the government for three out of the above four bills indicates the urgency in reviving the economic growth.

Interest rate cuts to help in credit growth: Expectations over RBI cutting the interest rates by over 50 basis points were reflected in 10Year G-Sec yields. The reduction in interest rates coupled with the improving business climate could trigger a pick-up in credit cycle.

Subdued inflation amid softening commodity prices: Crude oil prices after falling nearly 40% in 2014, are expected to remain soft in 2015 due to supply glut and lack of consensus among OPEC countries to cut the production. Expectations over lower consumption from China, European Union and lower import demand from the US could keep the global crude oil price under check.

Up-cycle in interest rates in the US reflects confidence about the sustainability of growth: US Fed is expected to increase the interest rates by up to 75 bps during 2015, for the first time after 2006, amid expectations over strong recovery in GDP growth to around 3%. The sharp increase could result in outflow of capital from emerging markets to the US. However, rising interest rates reaffirm the health of the US economic recovery.

Improved macros could bring stability in Indian currency markets: Amid expectations over lower fiscal deficit of 4% and current account deficit of 2%, on the back of lower import bills for crude oil and gold, INR is expected to display relative strength during 2015.

Sustainability of earnings growth: Corporate earnings in India are expected to grow over 15%-18% during 2015, which is likely to be revised further based on improvement on execution at ground level, softening commodity prices and sustainability of the global growth momentum.

Large equity issuance through disinvestment: Large equity issuances either to comply with SEBI guidelines on minimum public holding or new issuances like RINL could help the Government in meeting the disinvestment target as well as keep the IPO market buoyant.

Money flows into Indian equities to remain robust during 2015: Indian equities continue to be the 2nd best performing asset in the world equity markets, as well as the best performing asset class in India. Indian equities are expected to attract FII inflows in 2015, that were around Rs 97,600 cr in 2014. Amid political/economic stability, direct participation of retail investors has increased, while retail participation through mutual funds has also risen as indicated by the increase in individual folios by 8.4 lakh during Apr-Nov 2014, reflecting confidence among the retail investors on Indian equities.

Our take on the marketWe expect Sensex to trade in the band of 27720 - 35640. There could be short-term volatility as markets have priced in growth post the elections and multiples are at the middle of the trading band. The Sensex consensus EPS for FY15E is Rs.1635 and for FY16E is Rs.1980, implying a P/E band of 14 - 18x for FY16EPS. Sensex currently trades at 14x FY16E EPS. We remain overweight on Automobiles, BFSI, Cement, Consumer Goods, Infrastructure, Metals, Software and Pharma.

We expectEarnings upgrades and in a more conducive environment for the businesses, corporate earnings are expected to grow over 18% in the next one year

On ground execution of the capex cycle to pick up

Stable currency and improved government finances along with a decline in inflation likely to present the case for lower interest rates

Growing income levels and better job prospects trigger for higher domestic consumption

Overall, the scenario is conducive for cyclicals, manufacturing and export oriented sectors. With the expected growth in corporate earnings, continued inflow of funds from FII’s and renewed interest from the domestic investors, we expect equities to outperform other asset classes in the next one year and recommend to stay invested in equities.

Wealth Maximizer 2015: Our top ten Largecap picks in the Wealth Maximizer (for a time frame of 9-12 months) are Asian Paints, Divis Lab, HDFC Bank, ITC, JSW Steel, L&T, Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, TCS and Ultratech Cement.

As crude oil prices fall 47 percent in rupee terms over the past five months, CLSA feels consumer companies will benefit from it but growth pick may still take some time.

""While a part of the savings would be ploughed back in the form of higher adverstising and promotion (A&P), there would still be a positive impact on margins. The demand environment continues to remain weak, though, most companies expect a gradual pick-up in FY16,"" the firm says in a report.

It also feels that decline in oil prices may also help in lowering the freight costs for the industry. It sees Asian Paints and HUL as the key beneficiaries where oil derivatives form almost 40-45 percent of the input base.

CLSA warns that as the consumers tread through a challenging environment benign input prices also imply lesser contribution from price hike which may further impact the overall growth rate, negatively.

Stock specifically, it is positive on Godrej Consumer, United Spirits and Jubilant Food negative on HUL and Colgate.",181,0.5996127367019654

Brokerage house Credit Suisse sees FMCG companies like GSK Consumer, Dabur, Colgate Palmolive, Emami, and Hindustan Unilever seeing an expansion of between 18.-3.3 percent in their earnings per share for every 10 percent drop in crude prices, by way of lower input costs. The expansion is after assuming that the companies will utilize half of the benefits from lower operating costs on advertising and sales promotion.

Credit Suisse sees Asian Paints as the biggest beneficiary with a 6.5 percent increase in EPS for a 10 percent decline in crude prices, even after assuming that the company passes on some of the benefits to its customers by way of lower prices.

Equity benchmarks snapped three-day gains on Monday with the Sensex falling over 100 points as investors looked cautious ahead of RBI policy. Profit booking and weak global cues also pushed the market lower; oil, capital goods, metals, power and HDFC group stocks lost ground whereas FMCG, auto and select technology stocks supported the market.

The 30-share BSE Sensex fell 134.37 points to close at 28559.62. The 50-share NSE Nifty slipped 32.35 points to 8555.90 after hitting a record high of 8623 in early trade.

Though the market may be nervous ahead of RBI policy, the uptrend remains intact, say experts.

Ridham Desai of Morgan Stanley expects the Sensex to hit 32,500 by end of December 2015.

“Indian equities are benefiting from the start of a new growth cycle, a benign global environment resulting in a positive shift in terms of trade and reforms, which can lift India's potential growth rate,” he said.

Mark Matthews, Bank Julius Baer and Co is also bullish on Indian equities. He sees 50 percent upside from the current levels in the Indian market in the next 18-24 months on the back of improving economy and earnings growth.

However, according to Gautam Shah, Associate Director & Technical Analyst, JM Financial, it is time for investors to book serious profits as the market is showing signs of making a near term top. He expects the market to correct over the next 4 to 8 weeks.

Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India will unveil its fifth bimonthly monetary policy review on Tuesday. As the crude (one of the major contributors to inflation) has consistently been falling, investors feel the RBI may consider rate cut or may indicate rate cuts in next policy meets. A CNBC-TV18 poll shows that 95 percent economists don't expect a rate cut on Tuesday while 60 percent expect the governor to sound dovish.

The HSBC PMI hit a 21-month high in November at 53.3 versus 51.6 in October. Manufacturing operating conditions in India improved for the thirteenth month in a row in November, supported by stronger growth of output and new work intakes.

On the global front, Asian markets (barring Japan) closed lower with the Hang Seng falling 620 points while the Nikkei index hit a 7-year high. China’s manufacturing PMI hit six-month low at 50 in November from 50.4 in October.

European markets like France's CAC, Germany's DAX and Britain's FTSE were down 0.4-0.8 percent (at 16 hours IST) after Germany’s November manufacturing PMI was lowest in 17-month at 49.5 versus 51.4 in October.

The commodity collapse continued as oil saw its longest losing streak since 2008 crisis. Brent crude slumped further to USD 68 a barrel, down almost 3 percent today. Both Nymex and Brent have fallen for five straight months.

Back home, shares of ONGC and Hindalco Industries plunged 4 percent each followed by Reliance Industries, HDFC, Tata Steel, BHEL, Sesa Sterlite and Tata Power with 2-3 percent fall.

Infosys was down 0.2 percent as it will trade ex-bonus from Tuesday onwards. The software services exporter had announced the issue of bonus shares in the ratio of 1:1.

However, Asian Paints was the biggest gainer on the Nifty, up 7 percent after Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and raised target price to Rs 875 from 680 (18 percent potential upside).

Auto stocks remained in focus today. Car maker Maruti Suzuki was up 1.6 percent after it recorded a 19.5 percent growth in November sales. However, the company decided to recall 3796 Ciaz cars to replace the relevant part of clutch operation system.

Ashok Leyland was up 2.5 percent as the commercial vehicle maker sold 7,732 units in November, up 44 percent year-on-year led by strong growth in medium and heavy commercial vehicles sales. TVS Motor Company jumped 3 percent on reporting a 36 percent sales growth in November. Mahindra & Mahindra declined 2 percent as it recorded a 13 percent degrowth in November sales.

Hero Motocorp climbed 3.7 percent and Tata Motors gained 0.6 percent ahead of monthly sales data in evening today.

TCS, Hindustan Unilever, Axis Bank and Wipro were other gainers on the Sensex, up 1-3 percent.

Drug makers Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy Labs gained 2-4 percent intraday after Foreign Investment Promotion Board cleared Sun Pharma-Ranbaxy merger deal. But the comments from Competition Commission of India on the deal report dragged Sun Pharma half a percent. Ranbaxy trimmed gains to 0.7 percent.

Sources told CNBC-TV18 that CCI sent back merger deal to companies to make changes and asked both companies to divest some brands to avoid monopoly.

Crude impact continued on stocks. HPCL gained 1.2 percent while Cairn India lost 1.3 percent. Aviation stocks like SpiceJet and Jet Airways also continued to fly high on the back of declining crude prices, up 16.5 percent and 8 percent respectively. Berger Paints surged 12 percent.

In the broader space, shares of Shree Ganesh Jewellery and Gitanjali Gems were up 20 percent after the Reserve Bank of India announced the government had scrapped the 80:20 scheme, which mandated that 20 percent of raw gold imported into the country had to be exported as finished product. Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri, Tara Jewels, Titan Company and PC Jeweller gained 3-5 percent.

Mangalore Chemicals gained 9 percent on news that Vijay Mallya has resigned as a director from the company. This development brought more clarity and is likely to strengthen the case for Deepak Fertiliser in the ongoing race for Mangalore Chemicals.

Investors lapped up more shares of Asian Paints on Monday after Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BoAML) upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and raised target price to Rs 875 from 680 (18 percent potential upside). The stock gained as much as 5.55 percent to touch a record high of Rs 785.

The brokerage house sees growth accelerating to 29 percent compounded annual growth rate over FY15-17E versus 12 percent in the past four years.

According to the report, price target bakes in earnings per share upgrades of 11 percent/12 percent for FY16/FY17 led by a potential pick-up in demand due to improving macro and favorable raw material costs (especially crude linked) that canboost margins.

""The government’s push to smart cities and bright prospects for Asian Paints’ new business – home improvement segment – can provide further upside. We bake in 15 percent lower crude prices Y-o-Y - a sharper fall - can extend margin gains,"" said BoAML.

The brokerage sees margins rising 270 basis points in FY15-17E due to benign raw material costs (55 percent raw material costs are crude linked), portfolio premiumisation and modest price changes.

Brent crude fell below USD 70 a barrel. Prices have fallen for five straight months and are on longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis.

At 12:22 hours IST, Asian Paints was quoting at Rs 781.60, up Rs 37.90, or 5.10 percent.

Yadindra Kumar, GM Finance at Thangamayil Jewellery said with the RBI scrapping the 80:20 rule on gold imports, the availability of gold would improve and also help curb gold smuggling. It would also mean that the procurement costs for gold companies would be lower, he said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

According to him, as a result of this move, the company per se would see a volume growth of 25. Moreover, the upcoming festive season in December would also give a fillip to volumes, he added.

12:20pm FM to introduce GST Bill in winter session

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today expressed hope that the much-awaited GST Bill, which provides for a uniform indirect tax structure, would be introduced in the current winter session of Parliament.

""We will try and introduce GST (Goods and Services Tax) Bill in this session...GST Bill would be taken up by the Cabinet after Empowered Committee (of state finance Minister)meeting on December 12,"" he said here.

The government has proposed to implement GST from April 1, 2016, and the new Finance Commission may be set up ahead of its schedule to look into the issues related to the new indirect tax regime.

The GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT on the states front, besides local levies.

There are differences between the Centre and states on some issues with regard to the implementation of GST that includes the revenue neutral rate and keeping petroleum,liquor out of the ambit.

While a sub-committee on GST has suggested that the revenue neutral rate of GST be pegged at about 27 percent, the states are yet to decide on it.

It had suggested states GST at 13.91 percent and Central GST at 12.77 percent, reports PTI.

12:00pm Market Check

The market remained firm with the Nifty hitting fresh record high of 8623 led by classic defensives like FMCG and pharma stocks. Rate sensitives like banking and auto also lent support ahead of RBI policy tomorrow.

The Sensex rose 15.60 points to 28709.59 and the Nifty advanced 8.50 points to 8596.75. About 1196 shares have advanced, 1247 shares declined, and 65 shares are unchanged. The market sentiment has been supported by lower crude prices. Brent crude fell below USD 70 a barrel. Prices have fallen for five straight months and are on longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis.

Crude impact continued on stocks. HPCL gained 1.5 percent while Cairn India lost 1.5 percent. Asian Paints extended Friday's gains after Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock to buy. Aviation stocks like SpiceJet and Jet Airways also continued to fly high on the back of declining crude prices, up 8-14 percent.

Auto companies are in focus on account of November sales data expected today. Maruti Suzuki gained almost 2 percent today as sales are better-than-expected, up 19.5 percent Y-o-Y with exports up over 50 percent and domestic sales jumping 17 percent.

Gold companies like Titan, Shree Ganesh Jewelley, TBZ and PC Jeweller are zooming ahead, up 6-20 percent after the Reserve Bank of India removed the 80:20 scheme which curbed gold imports. This came as a big relief for the jewellery industry as it reduces bureaucratic hassles, delays and uncertainty.

Mangalore Chemicals gained 12 percent on news that Vijay Mallya has resigned as a director from the company. This development brought more clarity and is likely to strengthen the case for Deepak Fertiliser in the ongoing race for Mangalore Chemicals.

Sensex and Nifty rallied 399 points and 121 respectively treading 1.3 percent ahead of last week's closing levels. Markets in general remained mixed as BSE small-cap slipped 0.5 percent while mid-cap index was up 1.1 percent.

This week too public sector banks were at the forefront of gains in sectoral indices; CNX PSU Bank index which tracks PSU banking stocks jumped 5 percent. Sectoral stock indices representing realty, software, auto and power sectors gained between 1.4-3.6 percent. FMCG and Infrastructure spaces slipped 1.3 percent this week.

Top Nifty stocks that helped the index close with healthy gains this week were: BHEL, PNB, Hindalco, DLF, M&M, Tata Power and SBI which ran up between 5-13 percent. While, Bharti Airtel, NMDC, Cairn, ITC, Power Grid, Sesa Sterlite and JSPL logged losses between 1.5-4.7 percent, limiting the upside for the index. Among mid-cap and small stocks space: MAN Infra, JBF Ind, JK Tyre and Jet Airways shot up 23-40 percent.

A major boost was OPEC's decision to leave their production targets intact in their latest meeting. Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC's) reluctance to change production targets despite a supply glut and slippery oil prices sent stocks of Oil marketing companies (OMCs) such as Indian Oil, BPCL, HPCL between 4-9% higher; paint and tyre companies such as Asian paints and Apollo Tyres also surged as they operationally benefit from lower crude prices. Brent Crude fell to its multi-year lows of $73 on Friday.

The IMF estimates that every $10 drop in the price of oil boosts world's growth by 0.2%. The drop in oil prices can be expected to boost global growth by around 0.8% or so in 2015.

The week also saw a smooth but sluggish November series futures & options expiry on Thursday. Nifty rolled over to December series 72% vs 64% in last expiry. Higher rolls were witnessed in auto & infra spaces.

Commenting on the expiry, Amar Ambani, Head of Research, IIFL, said, ""The rollovers were strong on Index and market-wide front for December series. While the underlying sentiment still remains positive, 8550 level on spot remains a crucial hurdle for Nifty. Traders and investors should be extremely stock-specific. Among the sectors, pharma and banking are likely to trade firm in the near term.""

Another global boost was People's Bank of China decision to cut interest rates by 0.4 percent on Friday post market hours.

Expectations of a revival in demand for commodities in China as a result of this turned the spotlight domestically on metal stocks. CNX Metal index ended 1.6 percent higher; Hindalco zoomed 8.5 percent.

Health Ministry's diktat banning sale of loose cigarette, and also raised the minimum age for sale of tobacco products tripped the bulls briefly with ITC's 7 percent correction on Tuesday. The stock retreated 1.7 percent from its closing levels last week.

What's Next

A swathe of macro-economic data slated to be released next week will be watched closely. After auto sales, current account deficit and trade data on Monday, investors will hold their breaths for credit policy on Tuesday.

A whole host of stocks expected to benefit from the dramatic drop in oil prices zoomed in early Friday trading as the closely-followed international oil benchmark, Brent crude, fell below to USD 72, a four-and-a-half year low.

Oil prices have fallen from a high of USD 115 per barrel this year amid weak global demand and rising output, and the development is expected to be a broad positive for the Indian economy, a significant oil importer, as well as a large number of companies.

Shares of firms that have a direct positive impact – oil retailers, aviation firms, paints and tyre companies (where crude is a vital input) – were among the biggest gainers in the broader market, which itself was up over 1 percent.

The three state-run oil-marketing companies (OMCs), Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL, rose between 3.8 percent and 8.3 percent, amid hopes lower crude oil prices would help limit their losses on selling LPG and kerosene below cost.

The government allowed OMCs to price automotive fuels such as petrol (in 2010) and diesel (in October this year) at a profit but prices of cooking fuels such as LPG and kerosene continue to remain regulated under the belief that economically-weaker sections of the society should be protected from the impact of their full price.

Analysts believe that under-recoveries (losses that OMCs make by selling fuel below cost) are expected to be one-third of the Rs 1.43 lakh crore these companies incurred in fiscal year 2013-2014, primarily because of the fall in crude prices and as a result of diesel going out of the subsidy net.

Airline companies such as SpiceJet and Jet Airways shot up 10 percent and 20 percent, respectively, on hopes the crude fall would lead to oil marketing companies cutting aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel prices.

Fuel charges amount to one-third to a half of an airline’s operating expenses.

Tracking the stock markets has been the lifeblood of moneycontrol.com ever since it was founded 15 years ago.

As part of our 15-years special, in this article, we look at the Nifty 50, one of the two benchmarks of the Indian stock market alongside Sensex, and trace its performance through the period of our existence.

On November 9, 1999, the Nifty closed at 1,364 points. Through to November 7 2014, it has risen more than six-fold, closing at 8,337 – an absolute gain of 511 percent and a healthy annualized return of 12.83 percent.

However, there has been a lot of action within the Nifty over the past 15 years. As would be expected, there are many stocks whose returns have handsomely outscored the benchmark while many others have trailed it.

Below is a chart that shows how each of the Nifty’s constituents, as in 1999, have fared, in absolute terms and how much Rs 1,000 invested in each would have grown to today. Note that stock returns have been calculated after adjusting for stock splits and bonuses but do not include dividends.

Data Provided by Capitaline

Over the 15 year period, the top-three performing stocks have been the finance firms ICICI Bank (then ICICI), HDFC Bank and HDFC, in which Rs 1,000 invested would have grown about to Rs 49,696, Rs 49,366 and Rs 41,657, respectively.

While the bottom-three performers, who were then part of the Nifty, are TVS Motor, MTNL and NIIT, in which Rs 1,000 invested would have become Rs 364, Rs 179 and Rs 178, respectively.

But more interestingly, the Nifty itself has witnessed a major churn, with several stocks then no longer being part of the index today.

Only about 20 stocks out of the original Nifty 50 stocks in 1999 continue to be part of the index.

These are ACC, Ambuja Cement, Asian Paints, Bajaj Auto, BHEL, Cipla, Grasim, HDFC Bank, HDFC, Hero MotoCorp, Hindalco, HUL, ITC, ICICI Bank, Infosys, L&T, M&M, SBI, Tata Motors and Tata Steel.

This goes against the wisdom of investing in a portfolio of bluechip stocks and forgetting about them (which comes close to the argument of indexing) as bluechip stocks today may fall by the wayside tomorrow.

Admittedly though, investors today have access to index funds and ETFs that automatically reconstitute their portfolios in line with changes in the benchmark index, which would give buy-and-hold-ers a sound night of sleep.",414,0.1966256618499756

ICICIdirect.com's report on Asian Paints

Asian Paints reported a topline growth of ~16% YoY on the back of ~12% YoY growth in volume and ~4% YoY hike in price in Q2FY15. Volume growth in the decorative segment was largely driven by intact demand in tier-II and tier-III cities in the festive season.

EBITDA margins declined 164 bps YoY led by ~25% YoY increase in both employee cost and other cost. The spike in employee cost is attributable to higher gratuity provisioning while the sharp growth in other expenses was driven by a spurt in advertisement cost.

PAT increased 6% YoY supported by ~6% YoY rise in other income and 41% decline in interest outgo.

""APL has recorded revenue, PAT CAGR of 19.6%, 33%, respectively, supported by volume CAGR of ~16% during FY05-08. Better operating leverage led to an EBITDA margin expansion of 200 bps during the same period. We expect revenues and PAT to grow at a CAGR of 18.6% each for FY14-17E. We expect operating margins to inch up 60 bps by FY17E driven by high operating leverage due to sustained volume growth in decorative paints and a recovery in industrial paints demand. APL witnessed sustained revenue growth of 15-18% over the last five years. We believe the robust pace of growth in revenues and earnings would continue for a prolonged period with the economic recovery and GDP growth coming back on track. Also, high cash on the books could lead to an increase in dividend payout and improvement in RoEs. We roll over our valuation on FY17E considering the revival in the Indian economy and value the stock at 33x its FY17E earnings with a revised target price of Rs 733 per share and BUY recommendation"", says ICICIdirect.com research report.

Dolat Capital`s research report on Asian Paints“Asian Paint reported a consolidated revenue growth of 16.6% to Rs 36.3bn. EBITDA at Rs 5.36bn was up 5.9% YoY as margins declined by 164bps to 14.8%. Gross margin expanded by 37bps YoY to 43.7%. Higher employee cost up 46bps and other expenditure up 155bps YoY lead to a reduction in margins. Employee cost increased due to addition and fluctuation in gratuity valuation while other expenditure were higher due to higher advertising spend. PBT, was up 5.4% YoY and Adj PAT stood at Rs 3.47bn up 6.3% YoY. Standalone business (decorative paints) reported revenue of Rs 29.9bn up 18.3%. We estimate a volume growth of 13.5% and sustenance of strong volume growth despite higher base of last year (15% volume in Q2FY14) is encouraging. EBITDA grew by 5.4% as margin declined by 197bps to 16.1%. Gross margins expanded by 40bps YoY to 44.8%. Subsidiary business (Industrial and International) reported a 9.4% revenue growth to Rs 9.4bn and EBTDA grew by 1.4% to Rs 551mn. The company witnessed good growth in two wheeler. Gross margin remained flat and higher employee cost impacted the operating performance.” “Management indicated that festive season would improve the outlook for volume growth in Paints in the coming quarters. We introduce FY17 and estimate a 16.8% CAGR in revenue and 24% CAGR in earnings during FY14-17E. We expect strong PAT growth in the coming quarters, mainly due to lower base of last year and benign raw material cost. We believe, the P/E multiples remain high due to strong volume growth and improvement in margins. The stock trades at trading at very rich valuations at 33x FY16E of Rs19.6 and 26x FY17E EPS of Rs24.6. We recommend a Accumulate with a target price of Rs680,” says Dolat Capital research report.

Asian Paints net profit jumped 6.3 percent to Rs 347 crore. The company said the result of the quarter under review is not comparable with the corresponding quarter of the previous year as it acquired 51 percent stake in kitchen solutions provider Sleek International Pvt Ltd in August 2013. Overall expenses in the quarter stood at Rs 3,163.61 crore. In the second quarter of the previous year, the same stood at Rs 2,664.13 crore.

So how to trade it now?

According to Prabhudas Lilladher, Asian Paints’ Q2FY15 results were below estimates due to higher ad spend and other expenses despite sustained double digit volume growth across segments. The brokerage has reduced FY15 and FY16 EPS estimates by 3-4 percent due to higher employee costs and other expenses.

However, it has increased target price to Rs 639 and upgraded rating from reduce to accumulate. ""We remain positive on huge growth opportunity in decorative paints in India and ability of Asian Paints to capitalise on thesame due to strengths in distribution, branding and manufacturing. We estimate 22 percent PAT CAGR over FY14-17,"" it said in a note.

Dolat Capital also recommends accumulating with a target price of Rs 680. We introduce FY17 and estimate a 16.8 percent CAGR in revenue and 24 percent CAGR in earnings during FY14-17E. Expect strong PAT growth in the coming quarters, mainly due to lower base of last year and benign raw material cost,"" it said.

As crude oil prices fell below USD 90 a barrel in international market due to low demand and stronger dollar, investors started raising exposure to oil marketing, tyre and paint companies but they offloaded Cairn India shares on Friday.

Shares of Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) rallied 1.5-2 percent intraday while paint companies Shalimar Paints, Akzo Nobel India, Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac rallied 2.5-13 percent and tyre stocks like Apollo Tyres and JK Tyre gained 2.5-5 percent. However, oil exporter Cairn India fell as much as 3.8 percent.

India as a net importer of oil will be more benefited as it will pay less money for buying crude oil from oil exploring countries like Middle East. As far as oil marketing companies are concerned, they may make more profits on diesel (which was Rs 1.9 per litre last month) while paint and tyre companies are collateral beneficiaries of the decline in crude prices as a large part of their raw materials consists of oil coordinates.

Crude oil prices dropped to more than two-year lows on Europe growth concerns, oversupply and lower global demand. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery tumbled USD 1.49 to USD 84.87, its weakest level since June 2012. Brent crude fell USD 1.61 to USD 88.44, also the lowest level since June 2012.

Meanwhile, prices have also been dampened by ample global supplies owing to increased US shale gas production and a return to the market of Libyan oil following a prolonged disruption due to civil unrest.

Adding to investors concerns, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde warned Thursday that there was a 35-40 percent chance of the eurozone slipping back into recession if action is not taken to prevent it. The Fund this week cut its forecast for global growth in 2014 and 2015.

It’s a known fact that all companies go through a lifecycle. Picking investments involves buying stocks of companies that are at the most ripe time in their lifecycle to create shareholder wealth.

In a recent report, brokerage firm Ambit recently put out its latest findings in its “greatness” series – in which it tries to identify which Indian companies are poised to enter the most productive phases of their lifecycles, as well as establishes a framework of qualities historically found with such ‘great’ firms in the past.

Excerpts from the note:

-- The trajectory of a company over this lifecycle, and hence the extent of its success is decided by the decisions taken by its management at critical junctures (as one stage of a lifecycle comes to an end and a new one begins). The four lifecycle stages are: youth, prime, descent, turnaround/demise.

-- In the youth stage, promoters start small, hit upon a winning product/service and then start expanding. Shareholders returns are usually volatile in this stage. Typical characteristics of such firms include: recently-listed, narrow product range, no big-ticket acquisition plans, high return-on-equity/revenue growth, young promoters, and limited stock coverage. Examples include Infosys (1994-2002), Berger Paints (1991-2000) and IPCA Labs (2003-2014).

-- In the prime stage, the company is “on the top of its game”. It is typically the sector leader or among the top, announces large capex/acquisition plans backed by fund-raising, and also looks to diversify into other businesses. Characteristics also include: large following among investors, products have become brands, robust operating cash flows that enable the company to start paying healthy dividends, while acquisitions become frequent. Notable examples include Bharti Airtel (1999-2009), HDFC Bank (2003-2014) and Sun Pharma (2003-2014).

-- The descent stage arrives after the company has indulged in excesses at the peak of its success. Hubris and arrogance have set in as the company mistakenly believes itself to be unassailable. Unrelated diversifications made in the past eat into balance sheet and capital efficiency suffers. Characteristics include established past track records having resulted in hubris, forays into new businesses/geographies, new generation of promoters/management coming in, and a shift away from the company’s core strength.

These result in RoE and RoCE suffering. Notable examples are Tata Steel (2003-2014), TTK Prestige (1994-2004) and Suzlon (2007-2014)

-- Not all companies survive after the descent stage, those who do turn around, are where managements take corrective actions, take tough decisions such as selling off non-core businesses. Shareholder returns at such stages are similar to those during the ‘youth’ stage. Examples include: TTK Prestige (2004-2014), IndusInd Bank (2008-2011) and Titan (1999-2009).

Using the four-stage framework, Ambit has identified forward-looking ideas for each of those stages. “The objective is to help investors assess the future trajectories for these firms and hence the consequent share price implications,” it said.

Ambit’s recommendations are to Mayur Uniquoters, VA Tech Wabag and eClerx (youth), Page Industries, Motherson Sumi and CRISIL (prime), Asian Paints, Ambuja Cements and Apollo Tyres (descent) and Ashok Leyland, TVS Motors and Bajaj Electricals (turnaround), The firm’s recommendation is to buy companies at the youth, prime and turnaround stages while selling firms belonging to the descent stage.",536,-0.3333246310551961

Dolat Capital's top picks report

In Preferred Buy

Axis BankAs the investment cycle and money flow within the economy improves, the bank can see a reasonable amount of deflation in its stressed assets pool.

BioconRecent correction provides attractive opportunity to enter the stock with strong biz model.

Crompton GreavesExpect recovery in earnings from H2FY15 onwards led by improved performance in the international subsidiaries. Domestic business to be beneficiary of expected recovery in capex cycle.

KPIT TechnologiesWe believe the weak Q1 has set the floor on margins and stock performance. We are in sync with the management view that the weak result was a function of poor execution rather than any challenges on the business momentum.

Larsen and ToubroProxy play on recovery in infrastructure spend in India. Recent correction provides attractive opportunity to enter the stock.

PTC India Financial ServicesAll set to leverage upon the growth opportunities in the renewable energy segment, especially solar power. Current CRAR of 26% sufficient to fuel 2 years of high growth.

Out of Preferred Buy

Asian PaintsThere has been a recent run-up in the stock price and Valuations remain high

Engineers IndiaWith two large potential orders out of the way, near term earnings visibility has deteriorated.

Ipca LaboratoriesWe believe the inspection observation (Form 483) will be an overhang on the stock price in the near term given the uncertainty regarding the timelines for resolution

Karur Vysya BankAn improvement in overall asset quality is likely to be back-ended in FY15. Current valuations do not provide a favourable risk reward trade-off

Maruti Suzuki IndiaThe company is the only pure PV play in the listed space, however the sharp run up in the last couple of months makes valuation look expensive

State Bank of IndiaStress levels still elevated, rich valuations do not offer large upsides. Suprajit Engineering Fundamentals stand intact, however valuations look expensive at current levels

VoltasPotential upside remains capped post the recent run-up. Delayed execution could be a potential threat to the company's targeted margins.

Shares of Asian Paints touched a record high of Rs 680 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Monday, up 5.1 percent intraday on hopes of 20 percent growth in domestic paint industry by FY16. Akzo Nobel rallied more than 7 percent and Kansai Nerolac rose over 3 percent.

The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), on September 4, said the Indian paint industry is likely to surge from the current level of about Rs 40,600 crore to about Rs 62,000 crore by 2016 witnessing a breathtaking double-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 20 percent.

The factors that have fuelled the paint industry's growth are the rise in disposable income and education, increasing urbanisation, development of the rural market and various launches of many innovative products, it added.

As per the ASSOCHAM recent report on 'Indian paint Industry: 2014' reveals that India is the second-largest consumer of paint in Asia.

In FY14, the paint industry stood at Rs 40,600 crore with per capita consumption increasing to over 4 kgs, out of which the decorative segment contributed nearly 73 percent at Rs 29,638 crore, while the remaining Rs 10,962 crore was contributed by the industrial segment.

As per the ASSOCHAM findings, the rural market has grown at a rate of around 20 percent a year (in financial year 2014). Increase in sales outside metros, as rural India's incremental consumption expenditure is witnessing a handsome growth. The rural sector has a major share of the decorative paints segment. Thus, any benefit to the rural sector for improving the dispensable income is directly co-related to the growth of the paint industry. Besides, decorative paints are marketing savvy products backed by large advertisement campaigns and dealership networks, it added. ""Demands for decorative paints arise from household paintings, architectural and other display products. The demand for paint increases during festive season like Dusherra, Diwali, Onam, Christmas /New Year, as compared to other periods”, said DS Rawat, secretary general ASSOCHAM.

The report added that the major boost to the growth in Indian paint market has been provided by the decorative paint segment, which is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of more than 18 percent during the period 2014-15.

The unorganised sector controls around 35 percent of the paint market, with the organised sector accounting for the balance. In the unorganised segment, there are about 2,500 units having small and medium sized paint manufacturing plants.

The scrip of Asian Paints closed at Rs 676, up 4.5 percent on the BSE while Akzo Nobel gained 7 percent to Rs 1337 and Kansai Nerolac was up 2.78 percent to Rs 1841.7.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HCL Technologies and HDFC Bank are among the 50 best public companies in Asia-Pacific according to a compilation by Forbes, which ranked India second behind China as home to the ""world's next growth engines"".

The Forbes 2014 'honour roll of the Fabulous 50' lists best of Asia-Pacific's biggest publicly traded companies. China has 16 companies on the list, more than any other country, a distinction it has enjoyed for the last three years. However, the number of Chinese companies on the list has gone down from 20 last year on the back of slow economic growth in the country.

India trails China with 12 companies on the list, the same number as last year.

The Indian companies on the list are Asian Paints, Axis Bank, HCL Technologies, HDFC Bank, Lupin, Mahindra and Mahindra, Motherson Sumi Systems, Sun Pharma, TCS, Tata Motors, Tech Mahindra and Titan.

HDFC Bank, India's second-largest private sector bank, has made the list eight times, more than any other company since Forbes started the compilation in 2005.

TCS makes it to the list for the seventh time while Tech Mahindra, the country's fifth-largest IT player, debuts on the list after net profits soared 112 per cent to touch USD 500 million. Indian conglomerate ITC failed to make it to the list this year.

Forbes said TCS, India's largest IT company, boasts a market cap of USD 71.25 billion, bigger than the country's next 3 IT outfits combined.

""Long dependent on the US market, (TCS) may soon generate more than half its revenue outside the US,"" the publication said.

South Korea has six companies on the list, followed by Hong Kong with three and two each from Japan, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Technology companies dominated the list with nine representatives.

The consumer durables industry has the second most members with seven companies, including four motor vehicle giants from China and India, as the rise of Asia's middle class continues to drive demand.

Three oil and gas companies make it into the rank, up from only one firm from last year.The list is chosen from a pool of 1,300 companies in the region that have at least USD three billion in market cap or annual revenue.

Forbes took into account performance measures and outlook and did not include companies that carried a lot of debt or were more than 50 per cent state-owned.",409,0.11441428661346435

2014-01-31 12:09:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/kenneth-andrade-looking-beyond-currency-plays-1227977.html,"While there is a reasonable amount of optimism going into the general elections in 2014, we tend to believe that progress will be slow. Reason: Significant change is required for the environment to kick-start again. For the last three years, there has been no relevant framework for business to participate in profits; also, several industries have surplus capacity and the pricing power has been weak. Once there is some visibility of improved demand and capacities getting utilised, capex will return to the economy. This needs a big shift in policy, which may not happen in the first year post-elections. Till then, growth in the environment will only be incremental.

Last year we saw pharma and IT give some spectacular returns. Given a weak internal economy and a weak currency, companies in these sectors became the top holdings in many portfolios. Also, many of these businesses continued to display robust executions in the global environment. A depreciating currency can give a competitive edge, but we believe that, in isolation, it will not lead to the fortunes or misfortunes of a company — it needs to build on this environment and create a dominant share for itself in its segment. It is important to see that the business itself is growing at a fast rate. Only then will the currency play work for you.

Look at some of the best pharma companies that have done well in India. They have got the market capitalisation because they had a product to sell in the international markets. They were never dependent on rupee depreciation. What is important is the scalability of the business model. If the external environment gives you an advantage, then you have to make sure that it has a long standing impact on profit. That way, we can hold on to these companies irrespective of the rupee movement.

Indian companies were always in the pricing position but they could never scale the size of the opportunity. 2014 could give these companies the ability to do just that and I think that is what the year is going to be about.

Most of the mid-cap companies operate on this parameter: That should there be demand, they will figure out a way to meet it, but when the environment is not favourable then they will require time. The focus in the coming months would still be on export-dominated companies and while IT and pharma would remain core to many portfolios, more manufacturing and service firms would venture outside to capture their fair share of growth. However, we don’t want to look at them only as currency plays.

The domestic environment is slightly more challenging. Surplus capacities and absence of pricing abound in many industries. Where pricing exists, the scale remains absent. Take, for example, the lenders specific to the CV segment. There was no headline growth as there was no lending growth. If you try and stimulate growth, you will end up with higher delinquencies given that new borrowers may not be as disciplined as old customers. This is a cyclical downside that has impacted industry and affected the entire value chain.

As investors, we should be willing to ride with the company through a cyclical downside if we believe the industry will provide returns and that the company has consolidated its market share in the business. For instance, one of our larger holdings is a truck financier. It has been one of our top holdings for a long time. Percentage-wise it has come down but that is because the size of our fund has increased and the stock price has not done much.

When it was first written about, it was in our top five; now it is in the top 15. In that time, the portfolio size has gone up by 50 percent and this stock is down by about 25 percent. That explains the slip in the ranking. But we have always believed in the company’s execution. It has not lost market share or the ability to garner it if the business revives.

If we believe that the cycle is close to hitting its trough, I can’t see a reason why some of these companies cannot turn. Many people will say that those in auto finance or, for that matter, banking or any NBFC are affected because of higher interest rates. We look at it slightly differently. If the company can pass on the pricing to the end customer, high interest rates should ideally not be a problem. That is exactly what good companies are able to do.

Consumer non-durables has been a dominant holding for the fund. We look for companies with single products that have strong franchises and are in a position to dominate the business in terms of pricing power. Over the last three years, they have gained market shares despite the environment not being particularly healthy. The balance sheets have not deteriorated — there has been no accumulation of debt or increase in working capital. And they are expanding capacities.

Over a two-three year period, these companies don’t look expensive and will continue to maintain their dominance. Again, the opportunity size for these companies tends to be large. With 17 percent of the world population residing in India, they are catering to some growing need. And with such major market shares, you can’t ignore companies that have execution on their side. We are comfortable holding these companies even if there is no return for one year in terms of stock prices. We would like to see earnings catch up with price.

Currently we are also adding media to our portfolio. We have been holding one large broadcaster for three years now. If I had to put the broadcasting business in perspective, it is fairly consolidated with four large players. Cumulatively, the valuation of these companies who run successful general entertainment channels (listed and non-listed) will have a combined Rs 80,000 crore market capitalisation if I were to include the two non-listed companies in this space.If we need to complete the value chain of the industry for it to exist, it needs to be ably supported by distribution (DTH and cable) and content creation. These two segments have no market capitalisation and their profitability has been non-existent. In its desire to expand reach, the distribution business has been on a capex drive. But we see that ebbing. Many companies have refrained from un-remunerative pricing and the penetration of the market is almost complete.It would be interesting to see how the leaders in the business execute in this environment. We believe that you can’t create a Rs 80,000-crore industry (broadcasting) and keep it alive without the distribution business gaining from it.

(As told to Pravin Palande and Samar Srivastava)

Indian companies were always in the pricing position but they could never scale the size of the opportunity. 2014 could give these companies the ability to do just that

Shares of Asian Paints fell over 3 percent intraday on Tuesday as it posted weak December quarter results with margins declining 120 basis points to 15.6 percent. Higher input cost dragged gross margins sequentially by 230 basis points to 41 percent. Gains from low cost inventory of earlier quarter waned out and this quarter saw rise in input costs.

Don't miss: CIMB sees downside risk to Asian Paints' volume growth

Credit Suisse lowered target price to Rs 470 from Rs 481 as it reduced earnings estimates by 3 percent to build in marginally lower gross margins.

Motilal Oswal has a neutral rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 465. “Quarterly volatility of its performance has increased significantly in the last two years. Spike in raw material costs and currency depreciation constitute key downside risks,” it said in a note.

Its raw material cost jumped 17.35 percent to Rs 1,845.21 crore in the third quarter of FY14. Meanwhile, Asian Paints implemented yet another average price hike of 2.1 percent from February across its product portfolios owing to rise in input costs. This takes the cumulative price hike in FY14 to 6.2 percent, thereby displaying strong pricing power of the company.

The country's largest paint company by assets, disappointed street on every parameter. Its third quarter consolidated net profit fell 1.76 percent year-on-year to Rs 329.3 crore, dented by weak demand for industrial paint and high raw material cost. Consolidated total income grew 13.2 percent to Rs 3,452 crore in the quarter ended December 2013 from Rs 3,049.6 crore in a year ago period.

In an interview to CNBC-TV18 technical analyst, Meharaboon Irani, Nirmal Bang Securities shared his reading and outlook on stocks and sectors.

He has a sell call on Asian Paints because at the present valuations there is no money to be made.

Moreover, he thinks one should remain invested in the IT space. He also suggesting picking up stocks like Hindustan Zinc, Emami but is wary of banking space for the next two quarters.

Below is the verbatim transcript of his view on stocks on CNBC-TV18

Asian Paints

More than the numbers it is the valuation of Asian Paints, we have had a sell call on the stock for over two quarters before the stock spread around Rs 4800 was the price where we said it is time to book profit.

It was our favourite stock for quite sometime and despite the numbers not being good the fact is we may not see too much of selling because investors in Asian paints don't sell stocks in a hurry especially when you don't have too many thing to buy in this market. So whenever you have an economic upturn Asian Paints also will start moving up one fine day but relatively it will not do very well because people will have more investment opportunities in the market.

Right now ther are not many opportunities and so investors are just not selling Asian Paints but at the present price putting an incremental money is not too much of money sense because the fact is you are not going to make too much of money from here in terms of percentage returns on your incremental money which you have put in.

So continue to avoid this stock despite the fact that it is a great company, there is good cash flow otherwise but at the present price at the valuation at which it has I don't see money being made.

IT companies

All the IT companies caught the eye. Possibly Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and today the fact is most of them have run-up sharply and some of them have reacted. MindTree reacted little bit after the results, TCS is still reacting.

So, if there is some correction in these stocks then I would definitely be enthused to buy it. I think they have gone up too sharply but IT is a sector to stay at and I think this is a space to possibly remain invested in and one can also put in incremental money because there are not too many alternatives in the market for investment.

HZL, Emmami and banks:

We discussed Hindustan Zinc a month back when the price was around Rs 120-125 and we feel it is a clear ride till Rs 165-170 as and when this deal happens. People are discussing Rs 150-155 but even from the present level it is definitely a pick.

Emami is another interesting stock, margins have improved at a time when quite a few FMCG companies margins could come under little bit of strain that is what the previews as far as results of the consumption space indicates. But Emami numbers were at number two.

Federal Bank I would give it a clear pass, the resolution announced is fine but at the end of it I think the entire banking space could be wastage of time for the next two quarters.",567,-0.3266339103380839

Motilal Oswal has come out with its October-December earnings estimates for the consumer sector. The brokerage house expects Asian Paints to report a 11.3 percent growth quarter-on-quarter (up 8.5 percent Y-o-Y) in net profit at Rs 363.8 crore.

Sales of Asian Paints are expected to increase by 15.3 percent Q-o-Q (up 17.1 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs 3555.3 crore, according to Motilal Oswal.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are likely to rise by 19.2 percent Q-o-Q (up 15.7 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs 572.4 crore.

Motilal Oswal on Asian Paints:

We expect Asian Paints to post 17 percent revenue growth to INR 35.6 billion in 3QFY14, with another quarter of double-digit domestic decorative paints volume growth.

Related stories

We estimate 4 percent pricing growth during the quarter.

Operating margins would be flat at 16.1 percent, led by gross margin uptick of 100bp, as the full impact of price hikes taken in 2QFY14 flows through the P&L.

International business is likely to report mixed performance, with continued weakness in the Caribbean being offset to an extent by Middle East and Asia.

We estimate PAT growth at 8.5 percent, slightly subdued due to higher base (30.5 percent growth in 3QFY13).

The stock trades at 30.3x FY15E EPS of INR 16.

Third quarter results for FMCG sector is likely to be a poor show.

Persistent macro-economic challenges and weak demand will continue to weigh down heavily on the third quarter performance of the FMCG sector. Brokerages anticipate that volumes for the sector will remain muted and so remain underweight on the sector despite rich valuations tapering off.

Unanimously, brokerages expect sales growth for the sector to be moderate at 11%, down from the 13% growth in Q3FY13. While standard chartered expects sales growth to be 11.1%, Religare expects it to be 10.6% and Motilal Oswal is setting an estimate of 12%.

Standard chartered says a revival in consumer demand is still not visible and volumes will remain muted even as the unfavourable rupee plays havoc on the bottomline. While margins for the sector are expected to be healthy as a result of the harsh winter and shifting the product mix in favour of high-margin products, PAT growth for the companies is expected to be muted due to a higher tax rate.

Also read: ITC Q3 PAT seen up 13.7% at Rs 2332.3cr: Motilal Oswal

Overall PAT growth for the sector is expected to be around 12%. HUL, Nestle could report a PAT growth of less than 10%.

FMCG sector valuations

Even though valuations have come off due to moderate performance of FMCG companies over the past 6 months, the current valuations look rich as there is no visibility on the demand outlook. Valuations in the sector have come off from a forward P/E OF 34-35X in Q1FY14 to a forward P/E of 28X IN Q3FY14 and this has led to a consolidation in the stock prices.

Seconding this view says Religare says, the risk-reward profile is unfavourable and recommends profit booking, and advises selective buying in mid-caps.

So they have a sell rating on HUL, Asian Paints, Colgate, Nestle and GSK Consumer Motilal Oswal, on its part, expects weak guidance for topline growth from FMCG managements.

A bigger concern, they say, is the moderation in growth from rural markets, which is narrowing the gap between urban and rural growth. With fundamentals deteriorating and valuation premium at peak, Motilal Oswal expects the sector to underperform going forward. This could lead to more equity funds dumping the sector in lieu of attractive sectors such as it and pharma.",395,-0.893111613061693

I love how people can be in denial despite their call going horribly wrong. One of the leading brokerages downgraded Asian Paints on October 14, cutting the target from Rs 505 to Rs 405, and since the brokerage is a real blue blooded one, the stock fell from Rs 485 to Rs 470 – the analyst must have felt a million dollars, but wait, within 3 days, the stock is back to 485 and on 5th day, the stock hits a lifetime high of Rs 530 after spectacular number.

The brokerage also had a research tactical idea of the stock underperforming which was closed today. All they say in closing the note is this – ""This Research Tactical Idea is closed because the stock price has moved contrary to our expectations. Effective immediately, the Tactical Idea published on Asian Paints on October 14, 2013 has been discontinued and should no longer be relied upon.""

Now my problem is not that an analyst call has gone wrong. My problem is the resistance the analyst community has to eat their words and admitting that they got it wrong. I have seen 5 brokerage reports this morning and none of them has a buy on the stock, it’s a consensus Sell/Underperform/Underweight.

To all these analysts – I have just a one line response– the stock is up 8 percent this week, 13 percent this month and 20 percent this year. Oh, and the stock is up over 100 percent since the start of 2012.

Now of course, the key is what to do with this stock going forward. At 30-35x one year forward earnings, this is one of the most expensive stocks. But then, when has that stopped a stock from moving higher? If that was the case,

Jubilant Foodworks

would have never had the rally it had –

HUL

would have topped out at 450 or 500. Why are investors willing to pay this kind of premium?

The answer lies in the factor that we sometimes ignore; the growth factor. The company has seen double digit volume growth in a seasonally weak quarter. Over the last many years, the company has grown its topline and bottomline in double digits and the stock has been one of the most consistent performers over a 20 year period. In fact if you were to just take FY16 into account, the stock would be available at around 25x earnings, still expensive but then at least you have visibility and certainty of earnings. And then, it has always been expensive, as are most good things in life.

Bottomline, the stock may well correct 10 percent if the market gets into further risk on mood and we see a shift from defensives to high beta. But as of now there is no evidence to believe that the stock will change its texture of being a consistent long-term outperformer.",490,0.16207715272903442

He also sees EM equities performing well despite the possible tapering of monthly asset purchase programme by the US Federal Reserve.

APNT has taken 4 percent price hike in YTD FY14 to pass on the impact of rupee depreciation led raw material cost inflation.

We expect margin expansion of 40bp to 14.2 percent, as the benefit of low cost inventory is available in 2QFY14. We expect the currency impact on margins to manifest 3Q onwards.
