Infosys on Sunday, July 24, said that the demand outlook is good, amid macroeconomic uncertainties.

While there have been concerns about an impact on IT spending and a dent in demand due to an increase in interest rates and looming fears of a recession, Chief Financial Officer Salil Parekh said after the company announced its results for Q1FY23.

Parekh added that large deals — over $50 mn in size — are usually volatile, and the overall pipeline for large deals is larger than in the last three and six months. He added that in their pipeline, they have a good demand outlook on large deals within the US and European markets.

“There is talk of recession, there is an increase in interest rates. There are some pockets where we see this. For example, in the mortgage business in our financial services area. But, the view for us today given what we see in our pipeline is that the overall pipeline is strong at this stage. We are watching out for what can happen as the environment evolves and changes,” he said.

Parekh said the demand and strength in terms of overall growth and volume growth is what gave the firm the confidence to increase its revenue guidance. Infosys upped its revenue growth guidance to 14-16 percent from 13-15 percent for FY23.

He added that the firm is seeing two types of demand — digital transformation and those focused on cost and efficiency.

We have both of those within our mix and as we looked at this, even in the previous month, we've made sure that our focus remains on both types of programs. We feel in terms of automation, we have a tremendous capability that we think will be of great use to clients in any environment as they look at making efficiency within the tech landscape,” Parekh said.

However, Infosys maintained its margin guidance for the year 21-23 percent, and expect to remain at the lower end of that range.

During the company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) last month, CEO Salil Parekh allayed shareholder fears’ regarding the impact of the recession. Parekh had said that the company’s pipeline was strong and that they are “well-poised” to work with clients.

Most of Infosys’ peers struck a note of caution, but Infosys’ rival Wipro was upbeat and said there was no slowdown in spending, bookings were strong and the deal pipeline is robust.

“Despite the uncertainties of the macroeconomic environment, if I look at our pipeline, our order booking, and the discussion we are having with our customers, there has been no slowdown or pullback of spends for us. The demand for IT services is robust,” CEO Thierry Delaporte had said.

TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan had said that the company is vigilant due to macro-level uncertainties despite pipeline velocity and deal closures remaining strong.

Mindtree CEO Debashis Chatterjee had said there were instances of some clients who had been impacted due to their exposure to Ukraine and Russia deferring opportunities.",501,0.45557107708670874

IT services firm Infosys on Monday said it has launched new service offerings to help enterprises tap into 5G technology, while simultaneously helping communication service providers (CSPs) accelerate and monetise their 5G network deployment.

It added that 5G technology will transform network capabilities bringing in significant opportunities for network virtualisation, artificial intelligence and automation, while lowering associated costs considerably, and enhancing delivery of network-based services.

Infosys, India's second largest IT services firm, said 5G technology will enable enterprises – IT and other business departments – to usher in a new era of innovation, create new experiences and improve operational efficiency in organisations.

""5G is opening an array of opportunities for CSPs and enterprises in the digital era.

""I am glad that Salil has blessed Instep programme. Salil has indeed, in fact, for the first time in so many years, has expanded the scope of this project. I believe as against 175 we used to take, interns across the globe is probably now is 250 or so.""

""This is the part of the various transformational initiatives that he has put in place ever since he took over in January 2018 as CEO of the company,"" he said at an event here.

InStep is the city-based software major's internship programme which is an intensive stint offered every year to students selected from universities in the US, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region for getting hands-on experience in Infosys projects ranging from application development to business consulting across verticals.

This programme had turned out to be an ideal launch pad for overseas interns to pursue a global career, he said.

Explaining the philosophy behind the InStep, Murthy said Infosys realised in 1999 that to enhance company's brand, it should not only aim at becoming a multinational firm but also interacting with professionals belonging to multi-cultural systems around the world.

""This interaction will give a chance for the interns to know the Indian culture and the company's philosophy, which will build India's and Infosys' brand value in their eyes,"" he added.

Murthy said the best incentive a company can provide these youngsters was to promise them of using their projects to solve problems afflicting the society or a nation, which Infosys did in future by creating a repository of experiential knowledge acquired by way of InStep.

Since 1999 when the programme was launched, Infosys has trained several hundred overseas students for global careers in diverse sectors. Some of them have joined Infosys and are working at its development centres in the US, Europe and Australia.",344,0.859300509095192

IT major Infosys may have lost its mojo for past few years but it still remains a darling stock for option traders ahead of its quarterly earnings. Erratic movements of Infosys stock price post results have rewarded bearish traders with smart gains every three out of four occasions in the last 12 quarters.Infosys will announce its second quarter results of FY14 on October 11 and the F&O traders once again have positioned themselves in the Infosys for a big vicious movement post results.This article compares how the price earning multiple (P/E) of Infosys changes before and after result announcement.Price earnings multiple is calculated by dividing the stock price to earnings per share of the company. In simple terms, if Infosys P/E is 18, it means the company will take 18 years to generate profits equal to the current market price based on the current earnings per share.For calculation, the trailing 12-month consolidated EPS (TTM EPS) has been considered. The average change in P/E for Infosys on the result day for last 12 quarters or 3 years (15-Oct-10 to 11-Jul-13) is 2.45.The management's commentary on different business verticals performance, revision in guidance, client's spending scenario and key business verticals exit are some of the factors along with quarterly earnings performance that the market will watch it closely on result day and based on them market will factor it in price.Currently, its trading at 18.67 P/E based on consolidated EPS (Price Rs 3100). Considering the huge built-up in options and based on the quarterly earnings performance on either side if the stock's P/E changes by an average 2.45 (assuming Infy posts close to Rs 42 EPS in Sept quarter as well, TTM EPS will be Rs 166 ) then expect 400 rupees or 13 percent movement on either side (CMP Rs 3100). In that case, option buyers will not make moneyIf TTM EPS expands or contracts by 5% (TTM EPS Rs 175, Bullish scenario where Infy posts an EPS close to Rs 50 or TTM EPS Rs 158 highly bearish scenario where Infy posts an EPS close to Rs 33) then change in P/E and price adjustment will take Infy close to Rs 3700 (Bullish) or Rs 2550 (Bearish) translating Rs 550-600 movement on either side. The earnings upgrade or downgrade will be the key factor on result day.

Poor guidance coupled with disappointing quarterly results from Infosys forced many broking houses to re-rate the stock. Exit of two veterans from the top brass also raised eyebrows of investors and traders on Dalal Street.

Infosys Technologies ended down 9.59% post announcement of its Q4 numbers. The profit of Rs 1818 crore was below markets expectation. Revenues were up 2% to Rs 7,250 crore as against Rs 7,105.6 crore. Street was expecting net profit at Rs 1,856 crore and revenues at Rs 7,447 crore.

What brokerages have to say?

Motilal Oswal: Buy, Target Price: Rs 3400

We are revising our topline estimate slightly higher to 24% driven primarily on account of expectation of higher blended realization increase of 2.6% v/s our prior estimate of 1.5%.

We are assuming a lower margin decline of 150bp v/s management guidance of a decline of 300bp, though that still represents a downside relative to our prior assumption of flat margins (ex-currency). It may however be noted that the 150bp decline is on a lower base for FY11 driven by the 4QFY11 miss on margins. This results in an EPS downgrade of 7.6% from Rs152 to Rs140.6 (implying YoY growth of 17.7%). Assuming similar margin profile for FY13, we have downgraded our FY13 EPS estimate by 7.3% to Rs169.5 v/s prior estimate of Rs183. Keeping FY13 target P/E at 20x, our revised price target is Rs3,400, implying an upside of 14% from the CMP of Rs2,989. Maintain Buy.
