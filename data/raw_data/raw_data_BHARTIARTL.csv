Airtel Payments Bank on Thursday posted a multifold jump in net profit to Rs 7.7 crore in the September quarter mainly on account of uptick in saving accounts. The company, which is the only profitable payments bank, had posted a profit of Rs 3 crore in the year-ago period.

The revenue of Airtel Payments Bank grew 39 per cent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 427 crore during the reported quarter. The bank's Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) grew to Rs 5.8 crore, giving a boost to customer deposits, which grew 52 per cent year-on-year to Rs 2,060 crore, Airtel Payments Bank said in a statement.

""The growth in revenue and MTUs is driven primarily by an uptick in the bank's savings bank accounts,"" the statement said. The bank's annualised gross merchandise value stands at over Rs 2,50,000 crore.

""The success we have attained reaffirms the viability of the payments bank model, underscoring its pivotal role in addressing the digital and financial inclusion needs of India. We are well poised for a sustained growth and we remain committed to advancing our reach,"" Airtel Payments Bank MD and CEO Anubrata Biswas said."

Telecom tariffs in India are low and need to go up, Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal said on November 1, asserting that the industry needs to become viable. The Airtel top honcho described 5G as a ""long haul"" where use cases are still evolving globally, and made it clear that the company is not in any race to beat its drum on having the largest, fastest rollout, but instead is sharply focused on delivering good experience for its 5G customers.

He said Airtel does not believe in higher 5G tariff, but will continue to strive for overall hike in tariffs, while keeping the service most affordable and high quality. ""We also understand that the needs of different segments of customers and really don't believe in one-size-fits-all.

""For the telecom industry to continue to invest and deliver the digital vision of India, the industry needs to be viable and cross subsidisation, therefore or using the power of the balance sheet is not a sustainable proposition at the end,"" Vittal said at the Q2 earnings call. Vibrant competition, affordable tariffs, and financial viability of the industry can all go hand in hand, he said.

To a question on timing and possible extent of any tariff hike, Vittal noted that tariffs are low in India. ""…this is not all in our hands, tariffs are very low in India, both the average revenue per user as well as rate per GB. If you plot both of those on two axis, then we are right at the bottom on both,"" he said, adding that tariffs do need to go up, and the industry needs to become viable.

""But it is not at all in our hands. I would say just say wait and watch. The question is not whether it will happen, it is when it will happen. We've already seen two rounds of tariff increase since the launch of Reliance Jio, and hopefully it will happen at some stage, not in the distant future,"" he said, while declining to commit to specific timelines. On 5G, he said the challenge right now is that the ""real"" use case on 5G today is ""only speed"".

""So on the small device that you carry in your pocket, you may get 400-500 Mbps speeds… but the fact is for the applications that you use on that device, typically messaging or video or email, you really don't need more than 4-7 Mbps speeds. ""So users are actually oblivious of whether they have 5G or 4G, they are looking for a good data experience,"" he said.

More applications have to be on 5G, harnessing the true power of the fifth generation technology, he said. ""You need more applications to be written on 5G networks, which really use the benefit of this technology which, unfortunately, is not the case… not just in India, but in no market anywhere,"" Vittal said.

Except for some private 5G networks, and specific B2B use cases, which have modest revenue streams associated with it, the fundamental use cases for 5G ""are still not there"". ""That said, I think the reason 5G usage is today much higher… is simply because it's free. So the data is corrupted by the fact that it is free… if it is not free, then the real usage is what we will be able to study,"" he said.

India's second largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Tuesday reported a 37.5 per cent year-on-year fall in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,341 crore for the September quarter, weighed down by one-time exceptional charge. Bharti Airtel, which competes in the market with Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea, saw its September quarter revenue climb 7.3 per cent year-on-year to Rs 37,044 crore ""backed by strong and consistent performance in India operations"".

Telecom subscriber base in the country grew marginally to 1,173.89 million at the end of June on account of new customer additions led by Reliance Jio, sector regulator Trai said on Thursday.

The subscriber base growth was driven by mobile telephony where Reliance Jio added over 2.27 million new customers and Bharti Airtel added 1.4 million customers.

Brokerage firm Morgan Stanley has maintained the 'overweight' rating on Bharti Airtel Ltd and hiked its target price by 4 percent to Rs 870 a share.

The report explains the sensitivity of Bharti Airtel's fair value to a potential 4G tariff hike over the coming months and currency devaluation in Nigeria.

Morgan Stanley believes that the recent depreciation of the Nigerian Naira on the official market will have minimal consequences for Bharti Airtel. According to a news report, Nigeria's central bank allowed the naira to drop as much as 36 percent on the official market on Wednesday.

Airtel Africa (56.1 percent owned by Bharti Airtel) contributed 29.3 percent of consolidated revenue and 28.9 percent of consolidated EBITDA in FY23. Within Airtel Africa, Nigeria accounts for 40.5 percent of revenue and 45 percent of EBITDA. ""Assuming Nigeria's EBITDA were to fall 36 percent in dollar terms, this would impact Bharti Airtel's consolidated revenue by 4.3 percent and consolidated EBITDA by 4.7 percent,"" the Morgan Stanley report said.

In the last few weeks news reports suggest that Vodafone Idea is likely to raise funds. This has led to investor queries around tariff hikes and their potential impact on Bharti Airtel's EBITDA and fair value. The brokerage firm also said a rise in 4G tariffs in India is factored into their base case for FY25. However, Morgan Stanley is now examining the potential effects if this tariff increase were to happen in FY24.

Morgan Stanley has outlined three scenarios in their analysis. The first scenario assumes that half of the tariff hike projected for FY25 is implemented in FY24, while the remaining half occurs in FY25 as planned. The second scenario considers the possibility of the entire tariff hike taking place in FY24 without any additional hikes in FY25. Lastly, the third scenario assumes a 20 percent tariff hike in FY24 with no further increases in FY25.

""Across these scenarios, the sensitivity to the Bharti's India business's EBITDA was over 4 percent to over 11 percent for F24 and over 1 percent to over 7 percent for F25. In terms of sensitivity to base case fair value, it was over 2.6 percent to over 10 percent,"" the Morgan report said."

Data consumption (driven in large part by gaming, video, and entertainment) had suddenly skyrocketed. Prices per GB of data had plunged by as much as 1/10th from over Rs 150 per GB to less than Rs 10/GB.

Vagadia was in the thick of the 4G device ecosystem — almost all of which were powered by Qualcomm’s chipsets. In the last four years, he has been part of the rapid transition from 4G to 5G — which has brought in its wake a huge surge of expectations of new technologies and use cases.

Vagadia, who is VP and President- Qualcomm India & SAARC, shares thoughts on a wide range of issues around the new paradigms expected from the 5G economy in an interview with Moneycontrol.

What is your view on the response from subscribers to 5G services launched in India?

India has seen one of the fastest growths in data consumption over the past several years. India's average internet data usage has increased from 1.24 GB per month in 2018 to 17.18 GB in 2023. There is an innate need and desire to access and share content, both for business purposes as well as socially. And this is only going to get stronger, both in terms of quality and quantity. The need for better broadband technologies always existed and thankfully we now have 5G being rolled out.

It is early days for 5G in India but there’s no doubt that India is one of the fastest-growing digital economies in the world. There is a sizeable and growing segment of “experience first” consumers who seek premium mobile experiences. 5G will mark the era of next-gen connectivity for Indian consumers and drive mobile data usage and revenue for telcos. Even before the 5G rollout started, consumers have been seeking out 5G-compatible models at the time of upgrading their devices.

With telcos expanding the coverage of 5G services in their circles of operations, we can expect quite a significant percentage of India’s digital user base to upgrade to 5G in the coming years. This will enhance the consumer experience significantly.

A lot depends on the availability of affordable 5G handsets. What is your view on the expected volumes this year?

Our view is extremely positive. The volumes of 5G handsets being shipped have been on a largely upward trend in recent quarters, as consumers seek to “future-proof” their devices.

As 5G services get rolled out in more and more circles, the demand for 5G handsets is expected to increase further. The current mix of 5G devices in India is already at around 40 percent and 5G shipments are expected to grow to 50 percent of overall smartphone shipments by the end of the year.

Affordability, of course, remains an important consumer selection consideration, however, the consumer does not want to compromise even on other aspects such as better display, camera, memory, etc. Today, almost all major OEMs have a sizeable 5G portfolio as part of their current and planned offerings. As per Counterpoint data, 5G smartphone share in lower price bands (less than Rs 20,000) is gradually increasing (from 4 percent in 2021 to 14 percent in 2022) and is expected to reach 30 percent by the end of 2023.

Is the sweet spot of around $80 to $100 achievable for 5G devices?

The affordability of handsets will be important to the deeper adoption of 5G. On our part, Qualcomm has made a conscious effort to develop a 5G chipset portfolio for multiple price points. However, a lot also depends on adjacent cost factors like display, battery life, camera, and storage on the ODM/OEM side as those technologies are also evolving and driving customer experience. As 5G adoption picks up pace, market dynamics will ensure that prices touch a sweet spot at all levels, from entry-level to premium.

What will Qualcomm’s role be in this?

Qualcomm has developed 5G technologies and chipset platforms for a wide range of industrial and consumer applications. We currently have 5G-enabled mobile platforms across multiple price tiers and are working to expand that portfolio. We work with OEMs to help them build a healthy portfolio of 5G-enabled devices across multiple price points. On the services side, we play an active role in enabling 5G use cases for consumer and commercial applications and through technology collaborations with government bodies, telcos, independent software vendors, application ecosystem and infrastructure vendors.

Will the growth of 5G devices lead to a drastic drop in pure 4G device shipments?

It is expected that cumulative 5G smartphone shipments will cross the 100-million mark in Q2 2023 and surpass 4G smartphone shipments by the end of 2023. However, given India’s diverse user base, we will see both 4G and 5G handsets in co-existence. While the infrastructure for 4G is fully functional and efficient, 5G will take some time to reach that stage. Even as 5G decongests the 4G networks, it will improve the user experience for both 4G and 5G consumers. It also creates scope for other 4G-connected devices in the areas of IoT (smart products and utilities) and auto. All in all, 4G device shipments will continue to remain relevant and even see expansion into new areas of growth, beyond smartphones.

Is there any room for 4G and 5G networks to co-exist in the next 3-5 years?

Absolutely. 4G and 5G networks will co-exist for quite a while. 4G networks have been developed over several years of hard work by operators. 5G networks will also take a similar effort to reach that type of coverage. As such, a handset will operate in 4G as it moves out of the 5G network. The existing 4G networks will provide that cushion for service continuity as well as deploying other use cases for IoT. At some point, operators may decide to migrate 4G spectrum to 5G. However, that may not happen in the next 3-5 years. As such, the two networks can co-exist."

Airtel is ‘feverishly rolling out’ 5G services as it intends to reach pan-India coverage by March of 2024, said Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal.

“We are feverishly rolling out 5G, starting with the key cities. We have a commitment that by March 2024, we should be able to complete our mission of 5G everywhere,” Mittal told Moneycontrol at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos.

Earlier this week, Airtel announced the launch of 5G services in Agra, Meerut, Gorakhpur, Kanpur and Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh. The services are already live in Lucknow and Varanasi.

Mittal also indicated there was a positive sentiment for India at the annual meet of the global financial elite. “Everyone is talking about how confident Indian business leaders are here, especially compared to Western CEOs. India is in a good shape at the moment, with multiple tailwinds,” he added.

The Airtel chief also highlighted that India Stack, the country’s digital public goods architecture, has attracted worldwide attention and is set to be exported to countries in Africa and Latin America.

“Digital is an area which I think India has very clearly realized it has an advantage in. The India Stack is being talked about as a frugal stack serving 1.4 billion people, whether it's identity or payment, or data storage. Everything is working seamlessly at a very low cost,” he added.

While he appreciated the government for making it easy to follow and implement rules and regulations despite a high degree of compliance requirements, the Airtel chief also expressed hope that Indian telcos will get a pricing mechanism.

“We all know that we need to have an ARPU (average revenue per user) of Rs 300 a month, which will still be by far the cheapest. India needs to have an appropriate pricing mechanism. I hope we will get to that point,” he said.

Talking about the telecom industry’s demands from the Union Budget, Mittal said that the government has a tough job as it has to listen to all sections of society. “ I think the industry will be taken care of. In the end, industry must step up and fend for itself,” he added."

Shares of Vodafone Idea Ltd dipped to a 15-month low on January 9 as reports said that the beleaguered telecom service provider had not been unable to secure funding from the government, banks or its promoters.

The stock hit a low of Rs 7.35 a share, a level last seen on September 7, 2021. At 12.06pm, the stock was trading at Rs 7.40 on the BSE, down 5.1 percent from its previous close. The stock has declined 23.32 percent in FY23 so far.

Recently, the firm sought at least Rs 7,000 crore emergency fund from local banks, according to a newspaper report. The State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, HDFC Bank and IDFC First Bank are among the banks that the telco approached. However, lenders could wait for either capital increase by its promoters —UK's Vodafone Plc and India's Aditya Birla Group, or debt equity conversion by the government.

""If a fresh capital infusion from Vi's promoters does not come by January-February, it will become difficult for the telco to survive"", the ET report added. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

Vi's promoters had earlier assured the government that they would invest around Rs 10,000 crore. The assurance had come shortly before the government finalised a telecom sector revival package in September 2021.

Telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on January 5 that conversion of equity alone would not solve the company's financial problems and it needed a capital injection from multiple sources. The telecom operator is reeling under a debt burden of over Rs 2 trillion.

""Vodafone Idea (VIL) is our key avoid in the sector, given significant leverage and continued market share losses. VIL has struggled to keep pace with 4G transitions with Jio and Bharti over the last three years. Its higher regulatory payouts from the judgment in the AGR case and higher spectrum outgo (post-moratorium) also limit its ability to invest in the network for coverage and capacity"", said JP Morgan in its latest report."

With Vodafone Idea’s market share falling below 20 percent and Reliance Jio planning a public listing within two years, the days of ultra-low tariffs may be over for India’s mobile phone users, perking up return ratios for Bharti Airtel and Jio.

The share price of the two leading telecom operators have been reflecting this optimism. Bharati Airtel’s share price has risen from the Rs. 640 levels in July to a recent peak of Rs 850, and currently trades at Rs 828.

Since 2019, Bharti Airtel’s share price has nearly tripled and is currently at an all-time high. Reliance Industries' share price has been somewhat volatile because of the swings in its refining business, one steady reason for optimism in the stock has been the telecom business. Since the Covid lows, even Reliance Industries has gained more than two-and-a-half times.

In the wake of uncertainties around several other sectors either on account of global factors or slowing growth in the local market, could 2023 be another great year for telcos?

Bharti Airtel recently increased tariffs for its entry-level plans by about 57 percent in Haryana and Odisha on a trial basis.

The past few years have been difficult for India’s telecom companies. Their financials have been stressed because of low tariffs and fierce competition after Reliance Jio started services in September 2019 with its cheap data and call plans.

Tariff hikes

Telcos started increasing tariffs in December 2019 amid the acute financial stress they faced after reporting historic losses on account of provisioning for adjusted gross revenue dues payable to the government.

The highest tariff hike of 50-60 percent was in 2019 and that was followed by a 20-25 percent increase in November-December 2021, after foregoing one in 2020 due to the pandemic.

While tariff hikes have helped provide some reprieve, their financial burden increased after incurring heavy expenses related to the acquisition of 5G spectrum and the starting of services with the faster mobile communication standard.

Telcos spent Rs 1.5 lakh crore collectively to acquire 5G spectrum during the July-August 2022 auction. According to EY, a cumulative investment of Rs 92,100 crore to Rs 141,100 crore will be needed for various building blocks of 5G during the period from 2022 to 2027.

The rollout of 5G services will also increase their debt burden as telcos invest in building the nationwide infrastructure needed to provide 5G services.

Debt burden, return on investment

The aggregate debt of the major telecom service providers is likely to touch Rs 6.2 lakh crore by March 2023, an increase of about 30 percent from Rs 4.73 lakh crore at the end of FY22, according to rating company CareEdge. This comes on the back of an estimated annual instalment outgo of Rs 13,400 crore towards spectrum purchases and an investment outlay estimated at Rs 3 lakh crore in the next three years (FY23-25).

But can 5G truly deliver on this investment and by when? Analysts suggest 5G use cases will take time to roll out and then pay-off – telcos have been readying themselves with use cases to digitize a number of industries including automotive, healthcare, energy and utilities.

Ericsson projects 5G-enabled Business-to-Business (B2B) opportunity for Indian telcos to reach $17 billion by 2030. Jio has been focusing on 5G-as-a-service to enterprises, 5G robotics implementing services such as heavy lifting and logistics at warehouses, healthcare robots for medical assistance and 5G connected drones and so on.

Airtel has also been partnering for use cases including Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (AI/ML), 5G-powered quality inspection, smart factory and healthcare. Vodafone Idea has been developing use-cases in gaming, smart workplaces, education, healthcare and agriculture.

Telcos will need to pay their spectrum dues in 20 equal annual instalments at an interest rate of 7 percent; a two-year moratorium is offered in case they opt for upfront payment. Jio, Bharti and Vodafone Idea will pay an estimated $1 billion, $500 million and $200 million per annum, respectively, for the spectrum purchases, including the interest component.

Jio, Bharti, Vodafone Idea

With some funding raised through share sales over the past few years, leaders Jio and Bharti are set on a path of deleveraging and seem to be in a relatively better position to meet these additional expenses.

With a higher debt to service ratio, Vodafone Idea’s market share falling below the minimal level for survival, and Jio’s plan to go public in two years, tariff increases look more certain than ever.

The effects of the tariff hikes were reflected in their improved Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), a key performance metric for telcos. ARPU for the second quarter of FY22 increased by more than 20 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis for all three telcos.

Analysts expect that telcos will likely increase tariffs by 10 to 20 percent in the next 6-12 months.

According to Citigroup, if Bharti Airtel succeeds in implementing its trial tariff increases across all the circles it operates in, its mobile revenue could rise by 2.5-3 percent. Airtel can successfully implement this plan only if rival Reliance Jio also increase tariffs.

“If the competition follows, it will result in faster deleveraging of balance sheets and boost the generation of free cash flow, both being critical to telcos as they are currently spending significantly to roll out 5G networks,” ICICI Securities said in a report.

In its latest earnings call, Airtel MD Gopal Vittal said, “Our South Asia and India ROCE is at 8.4 percent. For a business that takes risk and puts in substantial capex in order to drive digital adoption in India, we believe this level of ROCE is very low. The only way to help remedy this situation is a tariff correction.”

ROCE is short for Return On Capital Employed, a a financial ratio used to assess a company's profitability and capital efficiency.I

Vittal said ARPU was actually higher seven years ago at almost Rs 200.

“If you look at the pricing structure today in India, whether it is ARPU or whether it is the rate per megabyte or rate per gigabyte, it is the lowest in the world, lower than sub-Saharan Africa, lower than our neighbouring countries here, low in Southeast Asia, let alone the developed markets. So every player will want a return on capital,” he said.

Profitability

For Reliance Jio, improved profitability coupled with the possibility of an IPO in the next couple of years may incentivise it to raise tariffs. ICICI Securities says Jio is in a good position to raise tariffs while still keeping it 20% more affordable.

“Bharti's and Jio’s free cash flow generation will improve as operating cash flow growth will more than offset incremental spectrum-related payments and the increase in 5G-related capex,” says Fitch ratings. “We believe that 5G capex in 2023-2024 will replace current 4G capex, as 4G coverage is largely complete. Telcos will also continue to strengthen their fibre infrastructure by connecting towers with fibre and backhaul infrastructure to prepare for the launch of 5G services.”

Cash-strapped Vodafone Idea, which has been losing subscribers, may benefit if consumers find the price hike by Airtel aggressive and move to its service. Additionally, Vodafone Idea also has an opportunity to hike its price and still make it relatively affordable while also boosting its revenue and increasing subscribers. While this will give Vodafone Idea a chance to earn its survival, it may hardly come at any significant cost to Bharti or Jio given its financial position does not place it in any position to effectively compete in the market.

“We believe capex will continue to remain muted till it improves its cash position either through a fund raise or further tariff hikes,” JP Morgan said about Vodafone Idea.

Vodafone Idea CEO Akshaya Moondra echoed the sentiment in its latest earnings call.

“It is important to note that despite the price intervention made in the last one year, tariffs in India continue to remain at unsustainable levels. And we believe that industry needs further tariff correction to support the continued investments,” Moondra said.

Vodafone Idea is struggling with its 5G services rollout, making fundraising critical. The company had accumulated losses of Rs 1.6 lakh crore in the last four financial years and Rs 2.2 lakh crore of net debt (excluding lease liabilities) on its balance sheet, comprising deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs 1.37 lakh crore.

The company has been in talks with lenders to raise Rs 20,000 crore for its capital expenditure, 5G rollout and vendor payments, which have been stalled because the government is yet to convert its interest on dues into equity as part of its telecom relief package.

“VI stares at a precarious position and continues to perform worse than peers. This is crucial to consider as it is already below the critical 20 percent market share levels,” r B&K Securities said in a report. “This is important as telecom has become a capex heavy model, where returns are driven by operating leverage. This will not be possible at such low market share levels, as pricing will be set by leaders who shall be at ~2x market share.”

Earnings Per Share

For Reliance Industries, while Earnings Per Share (EPS) expectation for the next year looks slightly lower than previously expected by analysts due to higher interest and taxation, overall EPS growth is expected to be strong over the next few years. Brokers estimate an average of around 22.7x and Rs. 109 as the P/E (price-earnings multiple) and EPS for FY23E respectively.

Similarly, EPS growth for Airtel is also positive with significant growth expected in the next year or so. The consensus for P/E and EPS for FY23E is approximately 51x and Rs. 17 respectively. For Vodafone Idea, expectations have been further lowered, and EPS remains negative for the foreseeable future.

Predictably, RIL has been maintained as a strong buy by analysts, thanks to an expected tariff hike, market share gain and lower Spectrum Usage Charge with few negative catalysts such as higher operating expenses and depreciation.

Improving network quality, increasing data consumption and ARPU largely boosts Airtel’s valuation outlook by analysts with some concerns regarding costs of funding and 5G roll out slowing profitability. Vodafone Idea, on the other hand, has been maintained as a sell by analysts, owing to increasing debt, lagging market share and its struggle with 5G rollout making future growth outlook uncertain.

The company is allowing post-paid customers to shift to the new plan without paying extra on their existing international roaming plans.

""The feedback that we have heard on international travel related concerns has compelled us to launch a defining proposition for our customers -- the Airtel World Pass.

""This offers our customers one pack for the globe, significantly greater value, allows them to control what they use on the app and allows for emergency data usage long after the pack allowance is over,"" Bharti Airtel Direct Consumer Business Shashwat Sharma said in a statement.

The new postpaid plans under World Pass range between Rs 649 and Rs 14,999 with validity ranging from 1 to 365 days. The new pre-paid plans will cost between Rs 649 to Rs 2,997 with validity in the range of 1 to 365 days.

The company's website shows that it has slashed basic data rates in the countries covered under ""World Pass"" to Rs 1.5 per megabyte (MB), or Rs 1,536 per GB, in 119 countries like US, UK, Nepal, China, Russia, UAE, Saudi Arabia etc, and to Rs 3 per MB, or Rs 3,072 per GB, in 65 countries like South Africa, Mauritius, Maldives, Mali, Egypt etc. The new rates reflect over 99 per cent reduction in standard basic data rates of international roaming (IR) packs.

The base data rate, which is charged when a customer has availed no plan, in IR packs of other countries is Rs 6.5 per 10 kilobyte or Rs 6.81 lakh per GB.

""I am certain our customers will benefit hugely from it as they travel the world, keeping their phones switched on, no matter where they are. As a matter of fact, our new plans offer significantly better value than travel or local sims in most countries."" Sharma said.

A customer care executive of the company shared that Airtel customers who are having a valid IR pack can now switch to new plans through their Airtel Thanks App.

""If a post-paid customer on international roaming switches to the new scheme, he will be billed as per the new plan,"" the executive said.

The executive added that old plans are not available for recharge now and it will sunset once validity of the old plans availed by customers expires."
"December 05, 2022 03:21 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/meta-to-jointly-invest-with-airtel-in-telecom-infrastructure-9652511.html,"Social media giant Meta Platforms and Bharti Airtel on Monday announced a collaboration to jointly invest in telecom infrastructure to cater to the rising demand of high speed data and digital services in India.

The announcement comes on the back of telecom operators' demand to share revenue with service providers to build networks.

""Airtel and Meta will jointly invest in global connectivity infrastructure and CPaaS (communications platform as a service) based new-age digital solutions to support the emerging requirements of customers and enterprises in India,"" the statement said.

As part of the collaboration, Airtel will partner with Meta and STC (Saudi Telecom Company), to extend the world's longest subsea cable system, 2Africa Pearls, to India.

The plan to extend 2Africa Pearls to India was announced by Meta in September 2021.

Under the collaboration, Airtel and Meta will extend the cable to Airtel's landing station in Mumbai and also pick up dedicated capacity to further strengthen its submarine network portfolio.

""The 2Africa cable will significantly boost India's cable capacity and empower global hyper-scalers and businesses to build new integrated solutions and provide a high-quality seamless experience to customers,"" the statement said.

Airtel will also integrate Meta's WhatsApp within its CPaaS platform. With this integration, businesses will now be able to use WhatsApp and reach to provide omnichannel customer engagement to enterprises.

""We, at Airtel, are delighted to deepen our partnership with Meta to serve India's digitally connected economy by leveraging the technology and infrastructure strengths of both companies. With our contributions to the 2Africa cable and Open RAN, we are investing in crucial and progressive connectivity infrastructure which is needed to support the increasing demand for high-speed data in India,"" Bharti Airtel, CEO for Global Business, Vani Venkatesh said.

Airtel and Meta are members of the Telecom Infra Project (TIP) Open RAN project group. Airtel has signed an agreement to help increase operational efficiency of Open RAN (radio access network) and facilitate energy management and automation in radio networks using advanced analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning models.

Airtel is currently conducting trials for 4G and 5G Open RAN solutions on select sites in the state of Haryana and will commercially deploy the solution across several locations in India over the next few quarters, the statement said.

""We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Airtel to further advance the region's connectivity infrastructure that will enable a better network experience for people and businesses across India,"" Meta, vice president of mobile partnerships, Francisco Varela said."
"November 21, 2022 04:53 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/airtel-raises-price-of-minimum-monthly-recharge-plan-by-57-to-rs-155-in-2-circles-pan-india-roll-out-expected-9574721.html,"Bharti Airtel has increased the price of its minimum recharge for 28 days mobile phone service plan by about 57 per cent to Rs 155 in Haryana and Odisha, according to the company's website and analysts.

The company has stopped its minimum recharge plan of Rs 99, under which it offered 200 megabyte of data and calls at the rate of Rs 2.5 paise per second. In Haryana and Odisha, Airtel has now started offering the Rs 155-plan with unlimited calling, 1 GB data and 300 SMSes.

According to sources closely engaged with the development, the company has started trial of the new plan and is likely to roll out the same across India based on the result.

It is likely to end all 28-day calling plans with SMS and data priced below Rs 155. This means that even for getting SMS service in the monthly plan, a customer will have to recharge his mobilephone account with a Rs 155 voucher.

An email query sent to Bharti Airtel in this regard elicited no reply.

ICICI Securities said that Bharti Airtel has embarked on a market-testing tariff hike in Haryana and Odisha circles, and the move has just added a huge upside risk to its estimates.

""The earlier Rs 99 recharge had Rs 99 talk-time value and very limited data of 200 MB valid for 28 days. In contrast, the now-adopted Rs 155 minimum recharge gives unlimited voice, 1GB data allowance and 300 SMSes. This is a massive 57 per cent surge in minimum recharge value, and has been done in the customer segment where affordability matters the most,"" ICICI Securities report by research analysts Sanjesh Jain and Akash Kumar said.

Previously, the company did a similar exercise (market-testing) when it increased its minimum recharge offer from Rs 79 to Rs 99 in select circles in 2021, the report said.

""Bharti has taken the industry's first step in implementing a tariff hike in the current market situation. We expect it to now wait for a competitive reaction. If it does not find enough support, then Bharti may be required to restore the Rs 99 pack. It would then be difficult to imagine who would take the next step for a tariff hike -- and would Bharti support it? Or has Bharti 'made an offer its competitors cannot refuse?' In our view, yes it has,"" the report said."

The service will be available to customers in a phased manner as the company continues to construct its network and complete the roll-out, the company said.

""I am thrilled to announce the launch of Airtel 5G Plus in Gurugram. Airtel customers can now experience ultrafast network and enjoy speeds up to 20-30 times faster than the current 4G speeds.

Apple will test the much-awaited 5G update for its smartphones in India as early as next week. The update will allow iPhone's in the country to access 5G services.

India rolled out the 5G services last month, and the network will go live in limited cities at first. The plan is to cover 200 cities in the next six months. Reliance Jio has promised 5G coverage across India by December 2023, and Bharti Airtel will complete its network by March 2024.

While 5G services are live in select cities at the time of writing, many smartphone manufacturers have realised that they would need to push an update to enable support for India's networks.

Newer Samsung phones are compatible with India's 5G services, so is Nothing's Phone (1). Google's Pixel 6a is also good to go, while Motorola has announced that it has already started updating some of its phones, and promises an update for its portfolio by November 2022.

Like the other companies that are now scampering to prepare an update, Apple's phones are already 5G-ready but are currently limited to 4G networks as users anxiously await the update.

The Cupertino technology giant had promised to enable the services by December and now it has taken the first steps towards that goal.

According to online reports, Apple will roll out the update for testing, as early as next week. Users who are part of Apple's Beta Software Program will get to test drive the update before the final rollout.

Once live, Airtel and Reliance Jio users with an iPhone SE 3, iPhone 12, iPhone 13 or iPhone 14 will be able to download and test the update. The main goal of this test is to gather feedback, and iron out any kinks before full release in December.

The Apple Beta Software Program is open to anyone with a valid Apple ID, who accepted the Beta Software Program Agreement during the sign-up process.

If you have done that, then you can simply enroll your Apple devices to receive the latest Beta's and test out new features or updates before the full release. To learn more about the program, head here.

"October 20, 2022 05:51 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/telcos-seen-dialling-steady-second-quarter-as-suc-savings-aid-margins-5g-updates-in-key-focus-9364401.html,"Representative Image

Telecom companies are expected to witness ”steady” revenue growth in Q2FY23 with slight sequential uptick in average revenue per user albeit softer net additions, while SUC (spectrum usage charges) savings are seen lifting margins, say analysts.

Amid mega 5G network deployments by telcos, market analysts will be keenly tuning in to management commentaries on pace of roll-out for next-generation services, capex outlook and markers on tariff hikes.

”We expect Indian telcos to report a steady quarter with stable ARPUs and slowing net adds. Margins would be higher q-o-q as we get 45-50 days benefits of lower SUC,” BofA Securities said in its Q2 earnings preview for the sector. India’s largest telecom operator Reliance Jio is expected to come out with its Q2 report card on October 21 (Friday), while Bharti Airtel is scheduled to announce its results on October 31.

In the earnings’ preview for the sector, ICICI Securities anticipated ”steady revenue growth” and said margins may jump on lower SUC. ”Q2FY23E estimate for telcos suggests steady mobile revenue growth aided by one additional day and subscriber growth for Bharti/ Reliance Jio,” it said.

”Q2FY23E estimate for telcos suggests steady mobile revenue growth aided by one additional day and subscriber growth for Bharti/ Reliance Jio,” it said. It expected margin expansion for mobile operators due to negligible spectrum usage charges.

”SUC was 3-3.5 per cent of AGR (Adjusted Gross Revenue) which has reduced to negligible on the purchase of spectrum in July ’22 auction; full benefit of low SUC will likely reflect in Q3FY23E,” the note by ICICI Securities said.

Average realisation per subscriber measured as ARPU is likely to show growth of 1.5-3 per cent on quarter and will be aided by one additional day and premiumisation, it said.

Jefferies said it expects the second quarter of FY23 to be a ”steady” one, ”with Bharti/Jio reporting 2-4 per cent q-o-q revenue growth”. ”We expect modest subscriber adds for Bharti and stronger adds for Jio, similar to 1Q,” Jefferies said.

Jefferies observed that ARPUs are likely to witness a 1-2 per cent sequential uptick driven by higher number of days in the quarter and better subscriber mix.

BNP Paribas sees the Indian telecom industry posting strong year on year revenue growth (19 per cent) in the second quarter of FY23, although the sequential growth (at 2.4 per cent) is likely to be weaker compared with the previous two quarters. This is because tariff hike benefits are largely behind and subscriber additions are likely to be muted, it said.

The Q2 score card comes amid large-scale network deployments across the country for 5G services, the much-talked about next-generation technology that promises ultra-high internet speeds, lag-free connectivity, and new-age applications. Hence updates on 5G roll-out, capex and cues on tariff hikes will be in focus for sector analysts.

Bharti Airtel has started rolling out 5G in eight cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Siliguri, Nagpur and Varanasi, while Jio has started beta trials in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Varanasi. The 5G services will progressively cover the entire country over the next couple of years — Jio promises to do that by December 2023 and Bharti Airtel by March 2024.

Meanwhile, top mobile phone makers, including Apple and Samsung, have said they will upgrade the software for their 5G-enabled phones in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 1 launched 5G services amid much fanfare, with leading telecom operators Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio outlining plans for the roll-out of the services in a select cities.

But most users in those select cities haven’t yet got smooth 5G services, leading to a blame game — telecom operators blame the delay in smartphone companies pushing out required software patches over the air, and the handset manufacturers rue patchy infrastructure. With 5G not just enabling faster internet but also holding the promise of rapid economic progress and boosting job creation, the government has asked companies to get cracking now.

And many companies have started falling in line — last week many smartphone players committed specific timelines for upgrading the software for their 5G-enabled phones."

The findings come a few days after 5G telephony was launched in the country on October 1 following which Reliance Jio, Airtel and other telecom operators announced the service for Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Varanasi.

Ookla used its Speedtest data to compare median 5G download speeds across four cities where both Jio and Airtel built their networks. Jio seems to be ahead of its nearest rival Airtel.

In Delhi, Jio almost broke 600 Mbps (598.58 Mbps), while Bharati Airtel reached the median download speed at 197.98 Mbps.

In Kolkata again, Jio was much faster at 482.02 Mbps against Airtel’s 33.83 Mbps. Ookla’s said operators’ median download speeds varied the most in the West Bengal capital.

Jio’s median download speed reached 515.38 Mbps in Mumbai against Airtel’s 271.07 Mbps.

In Varanasi, Jio and Airtel were much closer. Airtel achieved a 5G median download speed at 516.57 Mbps to Jio’s 485.22 Mbps.

According to data from Ookla’s Speedtest, the median global 5G download speed was 166.13 Mbps as of Q3, 2021, down from 206.22 Mbps in Q3 2020. This is primarily down to the fact that more users were logging into existing 5G networks.

According to the Speedtest Global Index, India ranked 117th in the world for mobile download speed at 13.52 Mbps in August 2022.

Ookla’s report also said iPhone users had the most 5G-capable phones. Only one in 10 respondents had an iPhone. According to Speedtest Intelligence data, “The iPhone 12 5G is the most popular 5G-capable device in the Indian market.”

In the survey, 51 percent of respondents already had phones supporting 5G. The top smartphone vendors in the Indian market are Samsung (31 percent), followed by Xiaomi (23 percent), Realme, and Vivo.

Ookla also said it was early days for 5G in India as most of Jio and Airtel networks were still in beta testing. It would continue to monitor 5G performance in India, see how operators scale networks, and assess the real-world performance as more consumers get online with 5G devices, it said.

Bharti Airtel launched 5G services in eight cities and Jio's 5G beta trial ""Jio True 5G for All"" is on in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Varanasi.

""Bharti and Singtel have agreed to work towards equalising their stake in Airtel over a period of time,"" the filing said.

The development comes after Singtel yesterday held a board meeting on the first quarter of the company.

CNBC Awaaz was the first to break this story last evening.

The Mittal family and Singtel are two shareholders in Bharti Telecom owning 50.56 percent and 49.44 percent stake respectively. Bharti Telecom is the promoter company of Bharti Airtel with 35.85 percent shareholding.

Naveen Kulkarni, CIO of Axis Securities in an interview to CNBC-TV18 said that Bharti Telecom buying stake in Bharti Airtel is a positive news. From a long term prespective, Bharti Airtel is a consistent compunder, telecom industry will grow at a good pace and Bharti Airtel will keep benefitilng from that.

India's second largest telecom player Bharti Airtel has paid Rs 8312.40 crore, nearly $1 billion, to the Department of Telecom (DoT) for 5G spectrum, it said in a regulatory filing on August 17.

The Sunil Mittal-led telco has paid four years of 2022 spectrum dues upfront. ""The company believes that this upfront payment, coupled with the moratorium on spectrum dues and AGR related payments for four years will free up future cash flows,"" Bharti Airtel said.

Airtel is now hopeful that the future business proceeds can be deployed to concentrate on 5G rollout.

Gopal Vittal MD & CEO, Bharti Airtel Ltd said, ""Airtel also has access to Rs 15,740 crore rupees in capital from the rights issue, which is yet to be called.""

Over last one year, Airtel has managed to clear Rs 24,333.70 crores of deferred spectrum liabilities, much ahead of schedule, the regulatory filing added.

The DoT had extended the due date to August 17 for entities to make the payment for the spectrum acquired by them in the recently-concluded auctions. The due date was extended by a day on account of bank holiday on August 16 in Mumbai and Maharashtra circles, according to an official note.

Reliance Jio, Adani Data Networks, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have acquired spectrum in the auction which concluded on August 1.

The country's biggest ever auction of telecom spectrum received a record Rs 1.5 lakh crore worth of bids, with Mukesh Ambani's Jio cornering nearly half of all the airwaves sold with a Rs 87,946.93 crore bid. Richest Indian Gautam Adani's group has placed bids worth Rs 211.86 crore for 400 MHz in a band that is not used for offering public telephony services.

Bharti Airtel made a successful bid of Rs 43,039.63 crore while Vodafone Idea Ltd bought spectrum for Rs 18,786.25 crore.

Bharti Airtel plans to borrow up to Rs 3,000 crore from the local money market to pay the government for the 5G airwaves it bought in the recently concluded auction, according to a report.

Commercial papers (CPs) with maturities up to 12 months are being sold by the telecom operator, according to the people aware of the matter, the Economic Times reported, citing three sources.

SBI Mutual Fund is believed to have agreed to buy over Rs 1,000 crore of Airtel's debt, and it will likely buy CPs maturing in February of next year at 6.53 percent, the report said.

At India's first 5G auction that ended earlier this month, Sunil Mittal's Airtel purchased a spectrum worth Rs 43,084 crore. If Airtel opts to pay for the 5G spectrum in 20 equal annual instalments, its first tranche would be Rs 3,848 crore, to be paid to the Department of Telecommunications by August 17, according to notices put up on the DoT website. It is widely expected that the carrier would opt for such a payment mechanism, the report added.

“Airtel is in talks with leading mutual funds, and global and local banks as they have approached large institutions,"" ET quoted one of the three people as saying.

The short-term loan is expected to be refinanced at the end of the maturities, the people said.

A person familiar with Vodafone Idea's plans said the cash-strapped operator is also in talks with a clutch of public sector banks about raising around Rs 1,600-1,700 crore, as quoted by the ET.

In response to a request for comment, Airtel, SBI MF, and Vodafone Idea did not respond by press time, as per the report.

Barclays, Citi, BNP Paribas, State Bank of India and other large public and private banks have been approached by Bharti Airtel. Barclays, BNP Paribas and Citi declined to comment, while SBI didn't reply to ET’s queries.

Vodafone Idea, meanwhile, has to pay Rs 1,679 crore as the first instalment.

Shares of Airtel closed 0.85 percent lower at Rs 703.80 on Tuesday on the BSE, while those of Vodafone Idea ended 1.49 percent higher at Rs 8.84.

Airtel has announced plans to roll out 5G services using the non-standalone mode and is targeting a pan-India rollout by March 2024. The company’s chief executive, Gopal Vittal, recently said 5G coverage plans were ready for some 5,000 cities and towns.

Market leader Jio was the biggest spender in the recent 5G auction, buying airwaves worth Rs 88,078 crore, followed by Airtel and Vi that spent Rs 18,799 crore.

""Airtel keeps raising funds across business purposes as money is fungible,"" another person cited said. A banker said the telco was a clean credit as it had the potential to grow.

India Ratings graded Airtel’s proposed CPs at A1+, a standard rank. ""Airtel’s spectrum footprint would strengthen through the acquisition of the right to use the 5G spectrum bands,” the ratings firm said on July 27.

Telecommunications services firm Bharti Airtel has announced on August 11 that its music streaming app Wynk Music has launched the Wynk Studio to help artists launch and monetize their music on multiple platforms. The company said in a statement: “Wynk Studio is Airtel’s leap towards accelerating the music ecosystem in India.""

Wynk has set aside Rs 100 crore to support and facilitate the identification of local talent on the app.

Wynk Studio, which aims to help independent musicians based in India and abroad release their music on various channels, will be a part of Airtel's portfolio of digital products that include Wynk, Airtel Xstream, Airtel Ads, and Airtel IQ.

In the next year, Wynk Studio intends to introduce 5,000 independent artists to the site and help showcase undiscovered talent. According to the company, the launch of new talents has been hindered by the three biggest issues facing the music industry at the present -- discovery, monetization, and analytics -- together which define success or failure in the Indian music industry.

Airtel said in a statement that on average, Indians listen to music for 21 hours per week as against the global average of 18 hours. Further, nearly 30 percent of the top songs in India currently across all music platforms are by independent musicians, and such artists are ""set to propel the industry's development by 50 percent, from about 2,000 crore at the moment to 3,000 crore by 2025"".

Wynk Studio already has over 100 artists on the platform from India, Singapore, and the United States with some such as Nishad Patki from Pune, a professor leaving their job to pursue their passion for music full time. Mumbai-based Prateek Gandhi (34 million streams) Gagan Baderiya from Bengaluru (17 million streams) and Harsha Prawin from Hyderabad (20 million streams) and small-town sensations Ajay Nagarkoti from Haldwani and D-Shaw from Vapi are some of the artists doing over a million streams each.

Commenting on the launch, Adarsh Nair, CEO, Airtel Digita,l said, “The creator economy for music is at a nascent stage but poised to grow significantly. With Wynk Studio, we are building a platform that allows an aspiring musician to pursue their passion and earn income at the same time. Airtel’s experience in music streaming, ability to achieve scale, and long-standing relationship with over 350 million customers will ensure that all stakeholders in the industry have an equal and rewarding journey. We are looking to attract talent from across the world and scale the platform to 5000 artists in the next one year.”"

Telecom major Bharti Airtel Ltd (Airtel) is expected to declare a 550 percent jump in its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June 2022 over the year-ago period. Its consolidated revenues are likely to post a 21 percent growth on-year.

On a sequential basis, the revenues are likely to remain flat with a marginal improvement of 3 percent, while the profit after tax is likely to shrink in a high single digit.

Airtel will declare its results for the June quarter on August 8. The Gurgaon based, second largest telecom operator of the country is expected to report a consolidated PAT of Rs 1,843 crore on consolidated revenues of Rs 32,445 crore for the quarter, according to a poll of brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.

The company had registered a consolidated PAT of Rs 283.5 crore during the corresponding quarter of last year on revenues of Rs 26,854 crore.

During the January–March period, the company had reported a consolidated profit of Rs 2,008 crore and revenue of Rs 31,500 crore.

The telecom services provider added 3 million net subscribers during the quarter (a sequential growth of 1.7 percent) taking its total subscriber base to 33 crore. The company is likely to reap the benefits of tariff hikes with the improvement in ARPU (average revenue per user) of 3 percent on quarter to Rs 185 per month.

“Among the other business segments, we model sequential revenue growth of 5 percent for Africa business, 2 percent for enterprise business and 9 percent for homes segment”, said a report from Kotak Institutional Equities.

The company witnessed a 2 percent QoQ growth in its subscriber base in Africa where the ARPU is seen improving by ~2 percent to $ 3.2 per month

“We expect healthy revenue and EBITDA growth with an EBITDA margin of 51 percent for Bharti, led by subscriber additions and ARPU improvement”, said a report from the brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Bharti’s strong FCF (free cash flow) of over Rs 20,000 crore and Rs 21,000 crore expected cash inflow (from uncalled rights issue and Google equity infusion) is sufficient to meet their investment needs in 5G spectrum. However, the risk of higher capex towards 5G remains a key overhang and investors will be closely monitoring its plans and strategy for 5G implementation in the country.

Airtel shares closed Rs 9.35 higher at Rs 703.65 on August 5, on The National Stock Exchange. The stock has generated returns of close to 20 percent during the past one year and is trading flat over the past one month.

Seven new rounds of bidding held on the sixth day of auction on Sunday 'dialled in' an incremental Rs 163 crore, propelling the cumulative spectrum sale beyond the Rs 1.50 lakh crore-mark.

The auction has fetched provisional bids worth Rs 1,50,130 crore in the first six days, according to data released by the telecom department. Sources said that after a relative easing of demand on Saturday, the UP East circle – which includes Lucknow, Allahabad, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Kanpur – saw bidding activity pick-up once again for 1800 MHz, a band primarily used by telcos for 4G services.

UP East – which has over 10 crore mobile subscribers – accounted for all the incremental spectrum sales on Sunday, amid a pitched battle for radio waves among players such as Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. As on May, Reliance Jio had 3.29 mobile subscribers in UP East, Bharti Airtel (3.7 crore) and Vodafone Idea (2.02 crore).

The bidding intensity for 1800 MHz band in Uttar Pradesh East circle had peaked between Wednesday and Friday, then subsided somewhat on Saturday. On Sunday, however, renewed interest was seen and demand flared once again outstripping the spectrum supply, sources said. All the three private operators are said to be keen on topping up their holdings in this band in UP East, as radiowaves in 900 MHz band are not available.

All eyes will be on this circle when bidding resumes on Monday with 38th round, and the auction timelines would depend on how the bidding progresses through the day. Telecom Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had earlier said the 5G auction underscored that industry wants to expand, and had entered a growth phase.

""The auction results are very good, close to Rs 1,49,966 crore has been committed by the industry for buying the spectrum,"" Vaishnaw had said at a briefing on Saturday. The reserve price fixed for spectrum is a ""fair number"" and the same is visible from the auction outcome, the minister had asserted.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio, Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and a unit of billionaire Gautam Adani’s flagship Adani Enterprises are in the race to bid for the 5G spectrum, which offers speeds about 10 times faster than 4G, lag-free connectivity and can enable billions of connected devices to share data in real-time. Besides powering ultra-low latency connections, which allow downloading full-length high-quality video or movie to a mobile device in a matter of seconds (even in crowded areas), the Fifth Generation or 5G would enable solutions such as e-health, connected vehicles, more-immersive augmented reality and metaverse experiences, life-saving use cases, and advanced mobile cloud gaming, among others.

Up until Friday, about 71 per cent of the total spectrum put on the block had been provisionally sold. After a flying start on Tuesday that saw players pouring in Rs 1.45 lakh crore on the first day, the numbers have inched up incrementally since Wednesday, with players such as Jio and Airtel locked in intense bidding in Uttar Pradesh East circle for 1800 MHz band.

In all, 72 GHz (gigahertz) of radiowaves worth at least Rs 4.3 lakh crore is on the block in the 2022 auction. The auction is being held for spectrum in various low (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz), mid (3300 MHz) and high (26 GHz) frequency bands."

Incrementally, Rs 111-112 crore came in on July 30, the provisional proceeds rising from the Rs 1,49,855 crore received till Friday from players like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. Industry analysts citing the telecom ministry data said that the demand in Uttar Pradesh East – which had peaked over the last three days – fell below supply levels on July 30.

Earlier, the demand was for 75 blocks against the supply of 54 blocks, experts said, adding in the just-concluded round the demand was for 50 blocks, four less than the supply in the circle. The demand-supply pattern in Uttar Pradesh East indicated that the bidding activity may be showing signs of winding down, although the situation will be clearer on July 31 morning.

Seven fresh rounds were conducted on July 30, and the bidding will resume on July 31 (a departure from the usual practice) with the 31st round. Till July 29, about 71 per cent of the total spectrum put on the block had been provisionally sold.

After a flying start on July 26 that saw players pouring in Rs 1.45 lakh crore on the first day, the numbers moved up only incrementally over July 27, 28, 29 and 30 as Jio and Airtel engaged in intense bidding in Uttar Pradesh East circle for 1800 MHz band in the last couple of days. In all, 72 GHz (gigahertz) of radiowaves worth at least Rs 4.3 lakh crore is on the block.

The auction is being held for spectrum in various low (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz), mid (3300 MHz) and high (26 GHz) frequency bands."

Telecom stocks ended on a mixed note on July 26, the first day of the 5G spectrum auction.

Shares of Bharti Airtel gained 0.83 per cent to settle at Rs 683.80 apiece on the BSE. During the day, it climbed 1 per cent to Rs 685.10.

Vodafone Idea fell 1.01 per cent to Rs 8.83 apiece. In intraday trade, it dipped 1.56 per cent to Rs 8.78. Shares of Reliance Industries ended flat at Rs 2,420.50 apiece, up 0.01 per cent.

India’s first auction of 5G spectrum, that powers ultra-high data speeds, is currently underway with a total of 72 GHz (gigahertz) of radio waves worth at least Rs 4.3 lakh crore up for bidding. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio, Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and a unit of billionaire Gautam Adani’s flagship Adani Enterprises are in the race to bid for 5G spectrum, that offers speeds about 10 times faster than 4G, lag-free connectivity, and can enable billions of connected devices to share data in real-time.

A unit of billionaire Gautam Adani’s flagship Adani Enterprise Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance group’s digital arm as well as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have applied to participate in the July 26 auction of 5G spectrum, the government said on July 12.

Adani Data Networks Ltd — in which AEL’s equity holding is 100 per cent — got initial approval for grant of unified licence with authorisation of ILD, NLD and ISP-B for Gujarat circle, just days before the July 8 deadline for applying for participation in the 5G auction.

Adani Data Networks showed a net worth of Rs 248.35 crore in its application to participate in the auction at the close of application on July 8, according to the information posted by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). AEL’s Rs 4,730.66 crore net worth will be counted for calculating the net worth towards the eligibility for bidding.

Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, a subsidiary of Jio Platforms Ltd – the unit that holds the digital assets of Reliance – also applied for participation in the spectrum bidding process. It has shown a net worth of Rs 1,97,790 crore as on March 31, 2022. As per the information posted by DoT about the applicants, Birla Group held a 27.38 per cent stake in Vodafone Idea and UK’s Vodafone 47.61 per cent.

Vodafone Idea has negative net worth of Rs 80,918 crore as on March, 2022, while the paid-up capital is at Rs 32,119 crore. Bharti Airtel’s net worth stood at Rs 75,886.8 crore as on March 31, 2022. ""applications have been received from the…applicants for participation in the 2022 auction for rights to use spectrum in 600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300 MHz and 26 GHz Bands,"" the Department of Telecom (DoT) said.

It listed out Adani Data Networks, Reliance Jio Infocomm, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel as the four applicants. The spectrum auction, scheduled to start on July 26, may see aggressive bids for some frequency bands, with the entry of Adani Data Networks and established players Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel looking to strengthen their hold in the industry.

Adani Group on July 9 said it is in the race to acquire spectrum, which it said will be used to create a private network to support its businesses from airports to power as well as data centres. A total of 72,097.85 MHz of spectrum worth at least Rs 4.3 lakh crore will be put on the block during the auction. The auction will be held for spectrum in various low (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz), mid (3300 MHz) and high (26 GHz) frequency bands.

On July 11, BofA Securities in a note on the Adani Group’s plans to bid in 5G auctions said, ""We consider this news flow negative for incumbent telcos as it increases competition in upcoming auction bidding as well as in the long-term opportunity to target the enterprise space."" Brokerage CLSA wondered why would Adani bid in auction versus awaiting a direct spectrum assignment.

""The question is why would Adanis bid in auction versus awaiting a direct spectrum assignment? Adani’s entry will create uncertainty over spectrum pricing in the 5G auctions, which was expected to see bidding competition primarily between Bharti Airtel and RJio,"" it said in a report. Goldman Sachs said that while the group has stated it does not intend to be in the consumer mobility space, ""we believe if the Adani Group does end up buying spectrum in the upcoming auction, it could potentially increase competition in enterprise 5G, in addition to opening the doors for the Adani Group to expand into consumer mobile services over time"".

Globally, 5G services have been launched in three bands — 700MHz (coverage), 3.5GHz (5G coverage and capacity) and 26GHz (capacity and low latency). ""However, with Adani group ruling out offering consumer mobility services, we believe that its participation in 5G spectrum auctions will be limited to 3.5 GHz and 26 GHz bands for provision of private enterprise 5G network services,"" said Credit Suisse.

The group’s foray to provide standalone 5G enterprise network solutions was a tad ""unclear"" given that globally, 5G enterprise use cases are still under pilot stages, it added. Credit Suisse also questioned the rationale behind bidding for 5G spectrum in auctions when the Centre has already allowed private enterprises to set up a captive non-public network by acquiring spectrum from the government for a nominal cost and without any licence fees.

""Whereas acquiring a 100 MHz block on a pan-India basis in 3.5 GHz band is likely to cost Rs 317 billion (Rs 31,700 crore) and 500 MHz in 26 GHz band is likely to cost another Rs 35 billion (Rs 3,500 crore). Of course, these come with comfortable payment terms,"" it said. Credit Suisse felt that the possibility of Adani Group foraying into consumer mobility in the future is ""non-zero""

""While the Adani group has expressly denied intentions of entering the consumer mobility business, we believe that market participants may still view this as a low, distant possibility given the sector’s history. However, it would require a meaningfully higher capital commitment…"" it added."

Industry body Broadband India Forum on Tuesday termed telcos’ arguments on a level playing field between public and captive private 5G networks as ”absurd and impractical”, and asserted that the two are separate sets of services on a completely different footing and not competing with each other. The age-old and time-tested concept of ’level playing field’ cannot apply in the case of captive private 5G networks, as they have several distinctive traits, which distinguish them from public networks, with whom they are being compared ”without any logic or basis”, Broadband India Forum (BIF) said in a statement.

”Seeking a level playing field with enterprises for captive private networks is akin to a child in kindergarten being asked to compete with someone who has a doctoral degree,” BIF President, TV Ramachandran pointed out. The suggestion that private networks should not be given spectrum in bands, which are possible for telcos to use for offering services is ”unjustified”, as the telcos’ businesses depend on economies of scale, while that of enterprise businesses having private networks does not, BIF said.

Regulations, Ramachandran said, are applied to mature players in the competition, who have significant market share and can abuse it. ”No mature regulator anywhere in the world imposes regulation on a player with no or minimal market share,” Ramachandran said. ”

The telecom players on Monday flagged their concerns over the decision on private captive networks, during the pre-bid conference held by the Department of Telecom (DoT). Industry association COAI – whose members include Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea – wrote to the DoT recently expressing disappointment at the government’s decision on captive private networks.

Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has demanded a level playing field, arguing that solution providers too should pay the license fee and GST at the rates applicable for telcos on the billed amount of revenue and that such captive networks must remain ”truly” private and isolated, and adhere to security norms. It has been argued that since a decision to enable the captive networks through direct spectrum assignment has been taken, the government must now restrict the scope of such non-public networks to machine-to-machine communication inside the specific premise and plant automation only. Such networks must ensure they do not cause any interference to public networks.

Last week, the Cabinet approved the auction of airwaves capable of offering fifth-generation or 5G telecom services, including ultra-high-speed internet, and gave its nod for setting up captive 5G networks by tech firms. While the 5G spectrum in nine frequency bands will be auctioned to telecom operators like Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio, enterprises and tech firms for the time being will be allowed to take the 5G spectrum for their captive non-public network on lease from the telecom companies.

A direct allocation to enterprises will follow a demand study and sector regulator Trai’s recommendation on aspects, such as pricing and modalities of such allocation."

Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Monday said its video streaming service, Airtel Xstream, has achieved 2 million paid subscriber mark, demonstrating a strong pace of growth as an OTT aggregator platform. Airtel Xstream offers a bouquet of OTT platforms to consumers across mobile and large screen formats.

""We are the fastest-growing OTT aggregator in India with two million paid subscribers,"" Adarsh Nair, CEO of Airtel Digital told PTI. Nair said Airtel Xstream is well-positioned to solve the challenges faced by both OTT content providers and customers.

""Customers face fragmented viewing experiences, multiple platforms for content, and pricing challenges, which Airtel Xstream solves,"" he said. The accelerated growth is also due to the ability to meet the needs of Indian consumer for compelling regional content.

""In addition to our existing partnership with 15 OTTs such as ErosNow, SonyLiv, Lionsgate, Hoichoi, ManoramaMax, Shemaroo, Ultra, Hungama Play, Ultra, EPICon, Docubay, DivoTV, etc, we have recently partnered with Chaupal TV and Kanncha Lannka, two of the most promising regional platforms with a dedicated viewership base across India, and we will now be able to extend our services to Punjabi, Bhojpuri, and Odia speaking audiences as well,"" Nair said.

Consumers are recognising the value proposition of good content being accessible without the hassles of multiple subscriptions. Airtel Xstream brings multiple OTTs under one login, one experience, and a single subscription price, he observed.

Announcing it has crossed the two million paid subscriber milestone, Airtel Xstream said significant user interest through repeat recharges/ subscriptions was seen in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. The average viewing time on Airtel XStream is about 150 minutes which is increasing consistently, and highlights customer stickiness.

""SonyLiv, Hungama, Eros Now and Lions Gate play are the most searched for content partners on the platform. Multiple content properties from Sony occupy position in the trending top 10 list,"" the company said.

Airtel is looking to achieve 20 million paid subscriptions mark for Airtel Xstream. Addition of Chaupal TV and Kanncha Lannka will increase the platform's appeal to the audiences in Punjab and Odisha and the diaspora based elsewhere in the country.

Airtel has also brought onboard Social Swag, an influencer commerce platform backed by celebrities such as Akshay Kumar, Rana Daggubati and Mahesh Bhupathi.

""Our accelerated growth is due to our ability to meet the needs of the Indian consumer for great regional content. We will be doubling down on our regional strategy with our existing partners and will continue to onboard new partners with stellar regional content catalogues,"" Nair said.

Mobile subscribers can select one OTT provider from the bouquet with a minimum recharge of Rs 148. The large screen format, launched earlier this year as Xstream Premium is also available at Rs 149 and enables access to over 10,500 movie titles and shows alongwith Live TV from Airtel's OTT content partners such as Sony LIV, Eros Now, Lionsgate Play, Hoichoi, ManoramaMax, Shemaroo, Ultra, HungamaPlay, EPICon, Docubay, DivoTV among others.

The Indian OTT sector is one of the most competitive emerging markets, with over 40 players in the ecosystem. The market is growing rapidly and expected to reach USD 2 billion by 2025, Nair said adding that Airtel Xstream is ""enthused"" by the accelerated growth and hopes to maintain the momentum."

The Democratic Republic of Congo has ordered mobile-phone companies operating in the African nation to pay a levy estimated at about $180 million a year, people with knowledge of the matter said.

The operators including Orange SA, Vodacom Group Ltd., Airtel Africa Plc, and Africell Holding SAL received invoices sent by the regulator through a consultancy, 5C Energy, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. The amount is based on the invoice the firms received for a seven-week period, they said.

Years of corruption and mismanagement has left government finances in Congo, one of the world’s biggest producers of copper and the main source of cobalt, in shambles. That’s prompted President Felix Tshisekedi’s government to find ways to broaden its tax base and boost its revenue.

Congo’s four mobile carriers -- “Africell, Airtel, Orange and Vodacom -- have been invoiced various amounts by the regulator following the introduction of levies,” the Federation Des Entreprises Du Congo, the main business association, said. “As things stand, all the carriers in the DRC have rejected these invoices as irregular and therefore unenforceable.”

The industry body said it wants to continue talks with the government and regulator to avoid raising prices.

The additional fee includes an amount charged on every voice minute, message, and megabyte of data used by customers, said the people. The levy cannot be passed onto users, they said.

Vodacom could not immediately comment on the matter, while Airtel and Orange declined to comment. Several calls, emails and messages to the Congo government, and 5C Energy remained unanswered.

Congo last year dropped a plan to tax mobile operators, following opposition from the public as it could lead higher costs."

The country's top three private telecom operators will resort to another round of tariff hike in the second half of the current fiscal and will close FY23 with a revenue growth of 20-25 per cent, a report said on Tuesday. A growth in average revenue per user is essential for the industry to invest in the network and spectrum, and if they do not do so, it can result in poor service offerings, domestic rating agency Crisil's research wing said in a report.

After years of intense competition following the entry of the deep-pocketed Reliance Jio, the industry had started hiking tariffs from December 2019. ""…revenue of the top three players is expected to grow a robust 20-25 per cent this fiscal,"" the note said, adding that the operating profit margin will expand by 1.80-2.20 per cent during the fiscal.

It said after a slow 5 per cent growth in the ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) in FY22, the crucial number is set to grow by 15-20 per cent in FY23 as the full impact of the hikes carried out in the previous fiscal plays out, and also on the back of the newer hikes which are expected in the second half of the current fiscal. Since players are expected to spend incrementally on network and regulatory capex in FY23, ARPU growth and tariff hikes could ease some pressure on their books, it said.

In the fiscal gone by, there was a fall in the overall number of subscribers as 3.70 crore inactive users were weeded out, the report said, adding that the active subscribers rose during the year. The three top telcos witnessed a 3 per cent rise in the number of active users by adding 2.90 crore subscribers to the tally, it said.

Reliance Jio saw its total subscriber base fall sharply between August 2021 and February 2022. However, the share of its active subscribers reached 94 per cent in March 2022, compared with 78 per cent in the first quarter of last fiscal, it said, adding that Bharti Airtel added 1.10 crore active subscribers during the fiscal year to take its share of active users to 99 per cent. For Vodafone Idea, it was a ""mixed bag"" during FY23 as the company lost 3 crore active subscribers because of low capex in 4G and ""deterioration of services"", the rating agency said."

Bharti Airtel is planning to set-up a new technology centre in Pune to support digital services in the Western region and will be hiring around 500 digital engineering professionals by the end of the current fiscal, a senior company official said.

This will be Airtel's fourth digital technology hub in India and first in the Western region to support its strategy to pivot to a digital services company, especially as 5G services are on the horizon.

Confirming the plans, Bharti Airtel chief information officer Pradipt Kapoor told PTI that Airtel is rapidly scaling up its in-house digital talent pool to support its transformation into a digital telco. ""Pune being an established IT and tech hub, makes it an obvious choice for Airtel to tap into the talent pool and also drive cross-industry collaboration,"" Kapoor said.

Airtel is looking to hire across multiple experiences and domains – Big Data, Machine Learning, Dev Ops, and Tech Ops. The company already has similar digital technology hubs in Gurgaon, Bengaluru (Airtel X-Labs) and Noida. These facilities employ close to 3,000 people. “In addition to top global talent including Silicon Valley and domestic start-ups, Airtel is hiring from engineering institutes like IITs, NITS, IIITs for its digital technology hubs,” a company official said.

"February 10, 2022 01:11 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/telecom/tariff-hike-dents-airtels-user-base-more-subscribers-disconnect-8071871.html,"There seems to be a massive churn in the mobile landscape, with Bharti Airtel at the losing end of it. Results reveal nearly 28 million users left Airtel in one quarter alone. Increasing competition and recent price hikes have meant that as much as 8.7% of the total user base has logged out in the lastest quarter alone.

The drop in subscriber number shows the price sensitivity of Airtel's user base. The company has embarked on much talked-about price hike during the quarter, and has hinted at more. MD Gopal Vittal told investors after the results, “Tariffs remain abysmally low in India, and another round of price hikes will likely happen in 2022, although it won’t in the next 3-to-4 months as the current SIM consolidation caused by the last round of hikes needs to come down.” The consolidation in the number of mobile SIM cards usually happens when consumers review their service provider after a round of price hikes. This has raised a question with in the analyst community, if the monetization of the user base is a challenge for Airtel?

What has caught the analysts' eye is the fall in data usage per consumer. That too has taken a hit despite the decline in user base. Whether is was due to the poor quality of user base or patchy network, that is not yet clear. But this churn seems to spilling beyond telephony, as even the Direct-To-Home user base continues to be eroded, by over 6%, for yet another quarter.

Bharti Airtel on February 8 reported a surprise 27 percent sequential decline in its consolidated net profit, at Rs 829.60 crore for Q3FY22. It reported a 5.4 percent quarter-on-quarter rise in consolidated revenues at Rs 29,866 crore.

Once a dominant player, Airtel's mobile subscriber base has declined in two out of last three quarters. Vittal admits the SIM consolidation could continue in the January-March quarter as well, after they doubled their base prepaid rates."

The US-based tech major Google’s $1-billion investment in Bharti Airtel is yet another signal that it is serious about the Indian market. While this might be a beneficial partnership to both Airtel and Google, experts pointed out that the investment might not bring in any change of fortune for the telecom major.

Experts further added that while there are synergies between the parties, execution will be key. Moneycontrol spoke to industry executives and analysts to decode the deal and what is in it for the companies.

Airtel-Google Deal

On January 28, Airtel announced that Google will invest $700 million to acquire a 1.28 percent stake in the firm at Rs 734 per share. Google will also invest another $300 million in multi-year commercial agreements, which will include investments in making smartphones affordable across price range and look at India-specific use cases for 5G, to accelerate cloud adoption, particularly for the small and medium businesses (SMBs).

These investments are a part of Google’s $10-billion India Digitisation Fund announced in 2020.

While this investment is significant, two experts Moneycontrol spoke to said that the $700 million (Rs 5200 crore) might not change fortunes for the telecom operator.

Sanjay Kapoor, former CEO, Bharti Airtel, and Entrepreneur & TMT Adviser, said, “This does not change anything in terms of capital requirement for Bharti. This investment is more strategic in nature.” Kapoor further added that the government wants to sell its stake in Bharti Hexacom and this is just enough to buy the government stake.

Also read: Bharti Airtel CEO says devices, networks, cloud adoption will be fired up with Google partnership

Aditya Kondawar from JST Investments too agreed that the Rs 5,200 crore is a token investment and will likely be used for buying government stake in the Bharti Hexacom.

Bharti Airtel has a debt of about Rs 1.66 lakh crore as of September 2021. According to reports, the government is looking to raise Rs 7,000 crore by selling its stake in TCIL, a joint venture between Bharti Airtel and the government. This also comes at a time when the company is investing significantly in 5G, and needs to build its war chest for implementation.

However, according to Kapoor, the investment, though timely, is inadequate to pursue its 5G strategy, which is a long-term strategy for the company.

While there might not be a direct monetary benefit for the telecom operator, analysts pointed out that the synergies could benefit both the companies as millions of users in tier-2 and tier-3 towns adapt to digital.

Google’s interest in Airtel

India, with its 1.3 billion population, is one of the most attractive markets for large technology players. Prabhu Ram, Head – Industry Intelligence Group, CyberMedia Research, said that India’s digital economy is on an upward growth curve, with more first-time digital users from Tier-II, Tier-III cities and towns coming online.

Tarun Pathak, Research Director, Counterpoint, shared that India will see close to 500 million smartphone users in the next five years, with as many as 270 million feature phones users upgrading it to smartphones.

Thomas George, President, CyberMedia Research, said with the consumption market in India so high, all the major tech players in the US, like Amazon, Apple, and Meta are looking at India for future growth opportunity.

While this could unlock huge growth potential for these companies, these users also need products and solutions that cater to their language needs, and also affordable. For companies to tap into this user base, they need to partner with enterprises that can help them reach the users at scale. The partnerships, including the deal with Airtel, are clearly the reflection of that.

In 2020, Google invested $4.5 billion and Meta, formerly Facebook, invested $5.7 billion on Jio Platforms. Google has also been making a series of investments in the Indian startups that will help the firm tap into the growing vernacular user base and humongous small and medium business community in India.

What is in it for Google and Airtel?

Neil Shah, Vice President, Counterpoint, said that there are multiple angles as to why Google has invested in the firm. “This is the largest Android market for the company globally, and the biggest for them in the next 10 years in terms of advertisement.”

Of the 1.3 billion users in the country, only over 500 million have smartphones, and many will be upgrading from feature phones to smartphones. Shah pointed out that there is a lot of upside to adding these users to Android, as they will over time generate advertising revenue for Google.

Let us consider that close to 500 million users will be added to the Android ecosystem in the next five years. Shah explained that if Google can get $0.5 per month (for ads) from a single user, this would be close to $6 per user per year. Translating this for 500 million users would be $3 billion in ad revenue for the firm.

“So this $3 billion per year from India is just by adding 500 million smartphone users. They can monetise more as they grow their user base. That is why Facebook (now Meta) is also eyeing India in such a big way,” Shah said.

Kapoor, who was quoted above, said that Google will also benefit hugely by getting inroads into profitable customer bases of India’s top two telcos, Airtel and Jio, through the partnerships.

The tech major will also be able to cross-sell Google Services by bundling this with the Airtel’s and sweeten the deal for the SMBs. Airtel and Google Cloud already have a partnership in place, where Airtel offers Google’s suite of services such as Gmail, Docs, and Drive to the SMBs using the telco’s service.

Airtel serves over 2,500 large businesses and over 500,000 SMBs and technology startups across India. The latest partnership can further build on this.

CyberMedia’s George, who was cited earlier, said that Airtel can also gain from Google’s software development strength to drive the digital services. Ram, who was quoted above, said that Google and Airtel’s unique strengths would potentially contribute to the development of India-specific 5G use cases, including, for healthcare, agriculture and education.

But there are challenges as well.

Challenges

Airtel had stayed away from discounting and subsidising smartphones so far.

Kapoor, Bharti Airtel former CEO, said, “The fact that Bharti (Airtel) will receive $300 million to develop the digital ecosystem and affordable devices does raise a question around Airtel’s participation in device subsidy that they have refrained from in the past.”

Unlike software, building hardware is challenging. Take for instance the recent launch of the JioNext phone. Experts added that the price of what was expected to be the cheapest smartphone went haywire due to supply side challenges. Affordable smartphones should be in the sub Rs 3,500 range, which was not the case with the Jio phone.

Though this could be resolved, firms will also have to find right partnerships to take this forward.

Counterpoint’s Pathak, said that the there is a need for sharper focus in these partnerships to make execution easier. “For instance, if you are talking about healthcare, what within healthcare are you focusing on? That would be important,” Pathak added."

Telecom operators, including Airtel, Jio and Vodafone Idea, have established 5G trials sites in Gurugram, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chandigarh, Delhi, Jamnagar, Ahmadabad, Chennai, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Pune and Gandhi Nagar, the DoT said.

A 6G 'Technology Innovation Group', or TIG, has been constituted by DoT to co-create and participate in the development of the 6G technology ecosystem through increased participation in a capability description, standards development at global standard-setting bodies.

""This would be necessary to prepare India's manufacturing and services ecosystem to capitalise on 6G opportunity,"" it said.

6G TIG comprises members from government, academia, industry associations and the Telecom Standards Development Society of India (TSDSI).

Here is the full text of Mukesh Ambani's speech:

Shri Ashwini Vaishnaw ji,

Shri Rajeev Chandrashekhar ji,

Shri Devusinh Chauhan ji,

Shri K Rajaraman ji,

Dr S P Kochhar

My good friends from the industry – Shri Sunil Mittal and Shri Kumar Mangalam Birla,

Distinguished delegates



Ladies and Gentlemen, a very warm good morning.

I want to congratulate the DoT and the COAI for hosting the fifth edition of the Indian Mobile Congress.

In a very short time, the Indian Mobile Congress has emerged as a prestigious platform for impact-making interaction among all the stakeholders in the industry.

This is because of the visionary leadership provided by our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji.

Because of our Prime Minister’s vision and mission, India has seen a spectacular transformation of the mobile and digital landscape since 2014.

Honourable Minister and Friends,

This conference is taking place at a crucial juncture in India’s post-COVID recovery.

On one hand, India is making phenomenal progress in its COVID-19 vaccination campaign.

And on the other hand, it is stepping up efforts to get the economy back on the high growth track.

Also read: 5G rollout should be India’s national priority: Mukesh Ambani

Our industry’s contribution to the success of these two gigantic tasks has been pivotal.

I am supremely confident that India will not only succeed in containing any future wave of COVID, but also stage a rapid economic comeback that will astonish the world.

My conviction is based on a good reason.

India has fundamentally redefined its relationship with technology in the past few years — especially since the outbreak of the pandemic.

Indians have embraced technology with unbridled optimism.

During COVID, when the chips were down, it is the chipsets that kept us going.

When COVID-induced lockdowns rocked our boats, it is technology that kept our lives and livelihoods afloat.

Work from Home, Study from Home, Pay from Home, Shop from Home...all this became common because of the world-class digital technology infrastructure created by our industry. 9

Friends,

The theme of this conference is ‘Connectivity for the next Decade’. I would like to place before all of you five ideas related to this theme.

My first idea is: India must complete the migration from 2G to 4G to 5G at the earliest.

To keep millions of Indians at the bottom of the socio-economic pyramid confined to 2G is to deprive them of the benefits of the digital revolution.

My second idea is: Roll-out of 5G should be India’s national priority.

At Jio, we are currently focused on 4G and 5G execution and broadband infrastructure expansion.

We have developed a 100% home-grown and comprehensive 5G solution which is fully cloud native and digitally managed.

Because of our converged, future-proof architecture, Jio's network could be quickly and seamlessly upgraded from 4G to 5G.

My third idea is: We should not lose sight of the fact that affordability has been a critical driver of the phenomenally rapid expansion of the mobile subscriber base in India.

India should move towards greater digital inclusion, and not greater digital exclusion.

When we talk of affordability in the policy context, we only think of affordability of services.

Actually, India needs to ensure affordability not only of services, but also of devices and applications.

The best way of ensuring comprehensive affordability is nimble adoption of futuristic technologies and supportive policy tools like use of the USO fund for purposes other than services. USO fund can be used to subsidise devices to select target groups.

My fourth idea is: Ubiquitous Fibre Connectivity should be completed across India on a mission mode.

This is because the world is now transitioning into a DIGITAL FIRST ERA, when almost everything will be done in the digital space first, and then translated into the physical world.

The paradigm of economic activities and even social interactions will change dramatically.

Virtual will become as important as real or Actual.

Wealth creation will not only be accelerated but will also become inclusive.

Indeed, adoption of the FIRST strategy, coupled with our demographic strength, will enable India to outperform most other countries.

This will necessitate increase in data carriage beyond anything we can now imagine.

Fibre has almost unlimited data carriage capacity.

Therefore, to be future-ready, India has to be fiber-ready.

Even during these Covid times, Jio was able to introduce Fibre to Home to 5 million homes.

If all the players in the industry work together, we can rapidly achieve a nationwide footprint of Fibre, just as we reached mobile telephony to every corner of the country in the last decade.

My fifth idea is: that, beyond connectivity, we should focus on the critical components of the digital eco-system which are necessary for India’s digital transformation.

The Government is putting in place a sound regulatory and policy framework for this.

This has helped thousands of young Indian entrepreneurs and start-ups create platforms, applications and solutions that can accelerate India’s digital transformation.

We are already seeing innovative solutions in Education, Financial Services, Entertainment, Retail, Agriculture, Manufacturing and other key verticals of the economy.

The National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) under the visionary leadership of our Prime Minister is set to transform the landscape of healthcare in India.

Another candidate for radical transformation is India’s energy systems.

Technologies are maturing for energy saving through smart grids, decarbonisation of the economy, and drastic reduction in cost of India’s transition to clean and green energy.

All this shows that CARE FOR THE PEOPLE and CARE FOR THE PLANET are embedded in the gigantic transformation our industry has initiated.

Distinguished Friends,

Our industry can take legitimate pride in the fact that we have democratized the Mobile and Digital Revolution in India.

Now we are ready to democratize digitally enabled development, so that its fruits can be enjoyed by all the 1.35 billion Indians.

We are determined to transform India as a premier Digital Society, with the ease of living and the ease of doing business, which are comparable to advanced countries in the world.

I end my remarks by pledging that we stand fully committed to realizing this mission and mandate of our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji.

Thank you and a very warm good morning to each and everyone of you.

“We also believe that this level of ARPU will enable substantial investments required in networks and spectrum and more importantly give Airtel the elbow room to roll out 5G in India,” it added.

The rate hike in November is the “first step in rebalancing tariffs” and will be applicable to all prepaid packs from November 26 onwards.

Note to readers: How ​do corporate leaders surf life after hanging up their boots? What do they do next? What are the lessons they learned in their eventful journeys? What advice do they have for the current crop of leaders? Veterans Unpacked is a series of interviews aimed to offer readers lessons from retired bosses on life outside the corner office.

In a career spanning three decades, of which half has focused on the telecoms sector, Sanjay Kapoor has been in leadership positions at Bharti Airtel, Micromax, and Xerox India.

Kapoor was part of the team that made Airtel the No. 1 telecom player in the country, and took it to the world outside. He also played an active role in industry forums, including the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) and National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), and the global board of GSMA.

The Delhi native, who got his business degree from Delhi University, and is a graduate of the Wharton Advanced Management Program, started his corporate journey working for the manufacturers of Usha Fans and Sewing Machines, and now says he spends his time between entrepreneurship, advisories, boards of companies, in market leader positions, and philanthropy. Edited excerpts from an interview:

What have you been up to since hanging up your boots?

Actually, it’s a total misconception that I have hung up my boots; I am as busy as I ever was. After a long corporate career of over three decades, which included fifteen years in telecom, and building India’s largest integrated telecoms company, I consciously decided to pursue my future professional endeavours with a lot more flexibility, diversity and zing. I christened it a “Plural Career”, which in my case, morphed into three key buckets of entrepreneurship, advisories and board memberships, with some time to spare for writing and philanthropy.

What keeps you busy now?

My entrepreneurial endeavours follow Jack Ma’s axiom of being surrounded by Gen Y and Z once you are in your 50s, and essentially back their ideas and fervour to create value. While a team of professionals runs an e-commerce trading business owned by my family, my entrepreneurial interests, though minority, are diversified to cover telecom, edTech, financial services, clean energy, smart devices, social commerce and more. The common thread being that all these early-stage ventures have a digital angle which is in line with my experience and inclination.

Another endeavour which keeps me close to the Gen Y and Gen Z communities is being on the investment committee of Good Capital, which was launched by the founders of Investopad (an incubator) to leverage their existing engagement model with early-stage companies.

My advisories currently include senior adviser roles at BCG, Tanla Platforms, MoodAgent (Denmark) and PlayMakerIQ (USA). In the recent past I have also advised Asia’s first digital MVNO, Circles.life and a wireless fibre company from Delaware, WeLink Communications. Periodically, I also advise some funds and large institutional investors, selectively.

I have been an independent director on the boards of Bennett Coleman, PVR, and Indus towers. Currently I am also a non-executive director on the boards of STC (telecom service provider in GCC) and Tanla Platforms (cloud communication player). I am also an independent director on the boards of VLCC and OnMobile Global.

Then, I write for business publications, and my philanthropic efforts are focused towards supporting the Genesis Foundation for their program of curing (treating) underprivileged juveniles for congenital heart diseases. They have helped save life for more than 3,200 kids so far.

Looking back, can you tell us about three interesting events or anything that has stayed with you since?

The first big pivotal opportunity in my life was at Modi Xerox, to pursue a fully paid full-time MBA at Cranfield School of Management-UK, under Xerox’s global program to augment top talent. Once I was back with an MBA degree after 12 years of a successful track record at Xerox, my aspirations had skyrocketed, and to fulfil them, I had to move out and landed myself in the cellular telecom space with a lesser known Bharti Cellular Ltd, which had a large shareholding from British Telecom. Rest is history, as they say.

All CEOs, whether in promoter-led companies or board-managed companies, generally follow a delegation of authority (DOA) and so did I. Often, such documents run into several pages, and something unorthodox happened when it was time to fix my DOA with my boss Sunil Bharti Mittal. He suggested that instead of writing down what I can do and how, as the CEO, let’s write down what I can’t do or can do with permission both prior and post. The point was instead of a long laundry list of 20 pages, we stripped it down to the essence of a negative list of seven or eight things. Some of those few things needed explicit permission and some needed post intimation.

He also suggested that to empower me, let’s restrict it to a single page with the number of points restricted to single digits. What he meant was I could do anything not on that sheet of paper. That was music to the ears of any CEO. We achieved it and restricted the list to seven-eight items like brand name and positioning changes; selling or buying parts of the company; hiring or firing my first line; expenditure both opex and capex beyond budgets. Anything we miss out will be to the CEOs advantage, my boss said. This best practice has stuck with me ever since and I have replicated it in some other environments/businesses I have advised.

The top tier at Airtel would meet every year for a formal strategy session and revisit the vision, mission and values to gauge the progress. Often these gospels consume a lot of written space and are verbose to an extent that no one remembers them by heart. While recasting them for a fresh five-year period, my top team took it upon themselves to simplify these to an extent where every employee will be able to verbally recall the vision, mission and values so that it becomes a way of life rather than glorified statements and posters. This gave rise to the culture of prioritising objectives and making tough “or” decisions rather than easy “and” decisions to draw the best out of resource allocation.

What do you miss most about the C-Suite?

I am a non-addictive personality, played golf passionately and gave it up when it began to grossly eat into family time. I consciously practice to live my life in the present. The C-Suite days were glorious and mutually rewarding. They lent me my reputation and credibility to pursue alternatives in life, but I never took myself overly seriously as a C-Suite professional. The problem begins to brew when you credit yourself for most of what happened in the organisations and businesses you led, and only then does it become difficult to let go. As adroit leaders, we build sustainable businesses and organisations that are not contingent on our permanency. The C-Suite doesn’t miss you and will have your replacement in place post your exit, therefore I don’t miss the C-Suite but do cherish the time I spent there. My experiences and learnings there will be my treasure for life.

If you had to relive your corporate career, what would you do differently?

Given my odds of being brought up by a single mother with limited financial resources, I cannot thank god more for his grace upon me and my family. With those odds I don’t think I could have changed anything for better than what I have. However, without the past odds, I would have spent more time internationally across continents and probably quit corporate life sooner to pursue entrepreneurship.

What are the changes in the corporate world that you see now that are vastly different from your time?

Generally the big shifts in the corporate world are on a continuum and don’t happen overnight, other than work-from-anywhere type situations forced by the likes of the global pandemic. The cheese was already moving during my times, and the velocity has now seen acceleration. The current environment will push corporates to think global (the next competitor-or collaborator could come from anywhere); collaborative mindset (learn to collaborate even with your fiercest competitor and remember winner can’t take it all); digitization will be on full-throttle (challenge will be to protect the digital assets) and populate the organisation with a right mix of digital natives, digital immigrants and digital aliens (experience vs. relevance); analytics (artificial intelligence, machine learning) will create the differentiation even in commodity businesses; customer experience and not customer service will decide the winners; great talent will have supply constraints and will command high premiums. A post COVID environment will be inflationary, thanks to supply chain disruption, regulatory and ESG-related changes.

Which business leader in the current crop impresses you?

A couple decades ago I would have instantly said Jack Welch. In this day and age, given the cataclysmic times we are in, there are different leaders I admire for different traits and accomplishments. I admire Tim Cook for ably stepping in the mega shoes of Steve Jobs. I admire Satya Nadella for rediscovering a behemoth like Microsoft. I admire Mukesh Ambani for his gargantuan vision to deliver colossal greenfield start-ups and upstage incumbents and I admire Azim Premji for being the torch-bearer of Indian entrepreneurs for giving back.

How do you plan for life after retirement?

India’s average life expectancy has increased to 69.4 years and urban India has a bit higher expectancy at 72.6 years. The current trends leave no ambiguity to conclude that retirement ages need to be deferred to a new normal, both for mental and financial semblance. Here, one size fits all does not work. For many like me, to be mentally and physically engaged with business and societal activities is far more important. As I advance towards the imaginary line of retirement as I am self-employed, the balance of activities will shift from commercial to non-commercial. Me-time will tend to increase significantly. Travel, which I enjoy, will be skewed in favour of leisure.

I sing in my free time and am a very ardent fan of old Bollywood music of the sixties to the eighties: Kishore Kumar, Mukesh, Hemant Kumar and so on. I have also been a trekker and mountaineer from early in my life

Is there anything you would tell your younger self?

I professionally envy those folks who have pursued their passion and converted their inherent talent or hobbies into their full time profession. To all youngsters I would say, the earlier you can discover you’re calling, your road to happiness will meet you faster. Earning money is important and should not be compromised but spend what you can afford to. If you leverage yourself to meet your lifestyle you will marginalise your ability to pursue alternative choices.

What is your advice for the next cadre of corporate leaders?

I have benefitted from the advice of management guru Ram Charan and have added my own insights for the next cadre. There are 60-70 traits known to practicing professionals, and each of us have 6-7 dominant ones. Play on your strengths and develop them, add new traits very selectively based on the environment and industry. Improving your judgement is paramount as a leader; learn from your judgements that went wrong. Observe all types of decision-making. Internal relationships are a multiplier for your leadership effectiveness. Work on them. Peer relationships are the toughest to manage. External relationships are a multiplier-on-multiplier and require a concerted effort over time; cherry-pick the ones you want to invest in. Don’t mistake networking with relationships. Online working may make that even tougher in the future."

Bharti Airtel on Monday said it has joined global efforts to combat climate change, as the telco has committed to reduce 50 per cent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by FY31 across its operations.

The company has pledged to significantly reduce its carbon footprint and emissions from its network operations and will achieve its overarching goals through multiple interventions, including accelerated green energy adoption across its network operations, energy-efficient infrastructure and processes as well as implementing sustainable business practices at its workplaces.

""Bharti Airtel today announced its commitment to contribute to global efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change and build a sustainable planet,"" Airtel said in a statement.

The company said it is committed to a 50 per cent reduction in GHG emissions by FY31 across its operations.

""Airtel has joined the Science-Based Targets initiative's (SBTi) ""Business Ambition for 1.5° C"" campaign and adopted targets to significantly reduce its carbon footprint and emissions from its network operations,"" the company statement added.

In simple terms, Business Ambition for 1.5 degree C is an urgent call to action for global businesses to commit to set science-based emissions reduction targets. It aims to avert the worst climate change impacts by limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degree celsius, and heading towards achieving a net-zero emissions economy.

Commenting on the latest initiative, Vidyut Gulati, Director - Legal, Bharti Airtel, termed climate change as the biggest challenge facing humanity.

""We must act collectively without further delay to ensure we do not go past the point of no return and have a sustainable planet. Businesses have a fundamental responsibility to contribute to this effort and Airtel has adopted an ambitious target in this direction and will report its progress transparently,"" Gulati said.

Meanwhile, Airtel has also become the first Indian telecommunications company to join the United Nations (UN) Global Compact - the largest corporate sustainability initiative in the world.

By becoming a signatory to the UN Global Compact framework, Airtel is aligning its comprehensive Environmental, Societal and Governance (ESG) initiatives to the global body's 10 principles, spanning Environment, Human Rights, Anti-Corruption and Labour.

Airtel is already aligned with the Paris Climate Accord. The company has a comprehensive environmental management framework and is proactively implementing clean, fuel-based power solutions for towers, data centres, switching centres and other facilities.

It has achieved a 97 per cent reduction in network emission intensity for mobile operations (from FY16), besides a 25 per cent increase in renewable energy deployment in operations over the same period through various green power wheeling agreements that helped in saving CO2 emissions, the statement added."

A day after telecom major Bharti Airtel announced that its Board of Directors has approved to raise capital up to Rs 21,000 crore via a rights issue, Sunil Bharti Mittal, while addressing the media, said the company's debt is at an 'extraordinary' level and that he believes ""there is an opportunity to accelerate growth. We needed access to growth capital.""

The founder and chairman of Bharti Enterprises also stated that no rights issue funds will be used to raise a stake in Indus towers. He added that the leverage was bothering investors and the company.

Mittal believes that Airtel will take a special place amongst Indian corporates and said that he has never felt more confident about this. Thus it 'would be a grave error if we stayed with business at usual at this time', Mittal said.

Further, Mittal remarked that 5G will become a reality in the second half of next year and that 'Bharti Airtel' bets on 5G. He hopes that the pricing of the spectrum be made equally attractive by the government for 5G as 5G devices' price points are coming down.

The chairman of the telco also estimated the ARPU (average revenue per user) to trend towards Rs 200 in this financial year and said it was time to raise tariffs. Airtel's ARPU rose Rs 146 from Rs 145 in the March quarter. The current ARPU, as stated in Q1 results, is Rs 146. He also clarified that there were no plans to sell more promoter stakes as that would be 'inappropriate'.



On August 29, Bharti Aitel said that its Board of Directors has approved raising capital up to Rs 21,000 crore by issuing equity shares of the face value of Rs 5 each of the company. The firm said that the board approved the right issue price to be set at Rs 535 per fully paid-up equity share, including a premium of Rs 530 per equity share.

""25% on application and balance in two more additional calls as may be decided by the Board/ Committee of the Board from time to time based on the Company’s requirements within an overall time-horizon of 36 months,"" the firm said in a regulatory filing.

The technology giant may be on its way to make a ""substantial investment, running into several thousands of crores of rupees” in Bharti Airtel, a report in The Times of India said.

Citing top sources, the report added that Google was in “advanced stage of negotiations” with the telecom company for the past one year. The fine points of the deal are being looked into by the internal and external legal and Merger and Acquisitions (M&A) teams of both the companies.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

In July 2020, Google invested $4.5 billion in Jio Platforms, taking a 7.73 percent stake in the company. This was the first investment from Google under its India Digitisation Fund, through which it plans to invest $10 billion over the next five to seven years to accelerate its digital economy.

Google and Jio Platforms also entered into a commercial agreement to jointly develop an entry-level affordable smartphone with optimisations to the Android operating system and the Play Store, an effort that would help millions of users in India become owners of smartphones.

Jio and Google cloud have also come together in a cloud partnership through which Reliance would migrate its core retail businesses like Reliance Retail, JioMart, JioHealth, JioSaavn and others to Google Cloud’s infrastructure.

Meanwhile, the deal could be a respite at the time when the telecom sector is facing serious financial stress after receiving a setback on the issue involving adjusted gross revenue (AGR)-related dues, as the Supreme Court dismissed the applications which sought re-calculation of dues.

The Supreme Court on August 24 restrained the Centre from encashing Bharti Airtel's bank guarantees for a period of at least three weeks to recover adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues of Videocon Telecom.

Videocon Telecom, whose spectrum was taken over by Airtel in 2016 for Rs 4,428 crore, is assessed to owe an amount of Rs 1,376 crore to the government in form of AGR dues.

On August 17, the DoT had issued a demand notice asking Airtel to pay the pending AGR dues of Videocon within a week. If the Sunil Mittal-led telecom giant fails to pay the stated amount within the stipulated time, its bank guarantees would be invoked, the department said.

Airtel subsequently moved the apex court, appealing the bench to restrain the DoT from encashing its bank guarantees.

Spectrum trading guidelines dictate that Videocon should have cleared all dues prior to concluding any agreement for spectrum trading, the company's counsel told the bench, as per a CNBC TV 18 report.

Videocon liability is now being foisted on Bharti Airtel by DoT, the counsel added, further pointing out that even if Videocon's liability is added to Airtel’s AGR, the latter's payment of Rs 18,004 crore ""easily satisfies the 10 percent payment that had to be made by March 2021"".

The court, apart from restraining the Centre from invoking Airtel's bank guarantees for three weeks, allowed the company to approach the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) to challenge DoT's order on Videocon's AGR dues.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who opposed Airtel's bid to approach the TDSAT, told the court that the demand notice issued by DoT was as per the SC’s order on AGR dues issued in September 2020, Economic Times reported. Mehta further added that he would contest the jurisdiction of the TDSAT to decide on the issue, the report added."

Vodafone Idea lost about 42.8 lakh subscribers during June, as its user base shrunk to 27.3 crore, compounding the woes of the debt-laden telco which is struggling to stay afloat.

According to telecom subscription data for the month of June released by sector regulator TRAI, Reliance Jio cemented it lead, gaining 54.6 lakh users. Its mobile subscriber base swelled to 43.6 crore in June.

The Mukesh Ambani led telecom operator also led the tally of subscriber net additions in wireline, onboarding 1.87 lakh new users in that category.

Bharti Airtel added 38.1 lakh wireless subscribers in June, pushing up its mobile user base to 35.2 crore.

Overall, the number of telephone subscribers in India increased to 120.2 crore at the end of June 2021, a monthly growth rate of 0.34 per cent.

Urban telephone subscription was up, but the rural subscriptions dipped marginally in June.

""As per the reports received from 440 operators in the month of June, 2021, the number of broadband subscribers increased from 780.27 million (about 78 crore) at the end of May-21 to 792.78 million (about 79.2 crore) at the end of June-21 with a monthly growth rate of 1.60 per cent,"" the data by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) showed.

The top five service providers constituted 98.7 per cent market share of the total broadband subscribers at the end of June.

TRAI''s subscriber count score card for June, comes amid an existential struggle of mobile operator Vodafone Idea in a three private player market.

Billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla recently stepped down as chairman of Vodafone Idea Ltd, within two months of offering to hand over Aditya Birla Group''s stake in the telco over to the government, in a bid to avert a crisis for the telecom company.

Vodafone Idea can raise funds through equity sale or promoters can infuse capital which can be used for clearing dues, non-profit entity Telecom Watchdog said in a letter to telecom minister while demanding rejection of the debt-ridden company's request seeking more time to pay dues of Rs 8,292 crore. Vodafone Idea (Vi) has approached the government to seek one-year moratorium on payment of spectrum instalment of over Rs 8,200 crore, due in April 2022.

Vi, in a letter to the telecom secretary on June 25, 2021, said it would be unable to pay the instalment of Rs 8,292 crore due on April 9, 2022 due to cash being used for payment of AGR (Adjusted Gross Revenue) dues and the inability of the operations to generate the required cash in a predatory pricing situation.

ALSO READ: Investors unwilling to put in money unless tariffs rise, industry health improves: Vodafone-Idea writes to DoT

Vi has also said that while it is working on raising new funding for the past six months, investors are not willing to invest in the company because they believe that unless there is a significant improvement in consumer tariffs, the health of the industry will not recover and they will incur a loss on their investment.

Telecom Watchdog in a letter dated July 3 alleged that there is no basis in Vi representation that investment is not coming to India due to lower tariffs and these ""false claims by VIL are made with an ulterior motive to avoid payment of the next instalment of government dues.""

When contacted, a Vi spokesperson said, ""Industry players have pointed out the tremendous stress in the telecom sector. COAI, the industry body representing all three private operators has over the last two years pointed out the need for support to the sector and unanimously asked for Floor pricing to be set for restoring the health of the sector. We would not comment on speculative commentary and ill-informed conclusions.

The non-profit entity said that Vi promoters, Kumar Manglam Birla and Vodafone Group Plc are financially very strong and their reluctance in clearing government dues is not proper. According to the entity, Birla has a personal net worth of Rs 99,000 crores which is almost 50 per cent more than his net worth last year and Vodafone Group Plc's market valuation was Rs 3,40,000 crores as of July 2, 2021.

""Both could have infused funds in the company to ensure timely payment of the government dues. Both have respectable images across the globe and should not have any constraint or difficulty in raising funds apart from improving operational performance of the company,"" the letter said. Promoters of Vi have made public statements that they will not infuse any fresh funds into the company.

Telecom Watchdog alleged that the request of Vi inability to raise funds establish its mismanagement of affairs in terms of operation and financial management. ""It (Vi) has miserably failed to raise funds by dilution of equity and upgrade its networks with latest technology to reduce cost etc,"" the letter said. The entity said the request of Vodafone Idea should not be considered as there cannot be any ""factually incorrect misleading statements than those given by VIL"" on the financial health of the Indian telecom sector.

It said that both Jio and Bharti Airtel have raised funds by diluting their equity which shows that the Indian telecom sector is a bright star and Vodafone Idea request should be rejected as ""there is no basis in VIL representation that investment is not coming to India due to lower tariffs"". Telecom Watchdog said that the government cannot continue to extend benefits just to help and keep afloat one single company which is unable to manage its own affairs.

""It is submitted that this is a fit case for a forensic audit of accounts for the last 10 years at least to examine misrepresentation of facts to lenders or diversion of funds to delay or avoid payment of government dues,"" the letter claimed. Vi has reported narrowing of its consolidated loss to Rs 7,022.8 crore for the quarter ended March 2021, mainly on account of cost optimisation. The company had posted a loss of Rs 11,643.5 crore in the same period a year ago.

Total income declined by about 19 per cent to Rs 9,647.8 crore from Rs 11,920.4 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2019-20. For the year ended March 31, 2021, Vi loss narrowed to Rs 44,233.1 crore from Rs 73,878.1 crore at the end of 2019-20. The gross debt (excluding lease liabilities) on VI as of March 31, 2021 was Rs 1,80,310 crore, comprising of deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs 96,270 crore and AGR (adjusted gross revenue) liability of Rs 60,960 crore that is due to the government and debt from banks and financial institutions of Rs 23,080 crore."

On June 21, Airtel and Tata Group’s IT arm TCS announced partnership for implementation of 5G solutions, starting pilot from January 2022. A move that would help the latter strengthen its capability and scale and the former reduce the cost of the deployment, say analysts.

What does the partnership entail?

TCS will implement the 5G solutions it has developed for Airtel. Tata Group has developed 5G solutions using Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN), a part of telecommunication architecture. O-RAN is similar to open source in software, that is, it is not proprietary. It can be used by any company to develop solutions hence making it flexible for more companies to develop solutions. Increased participation brings down the cost for 5G implementation.

TCS has developed solution based on O-RAN and will be commercially available on January 2022, when the pilot deployment will begin.

What is in it for TCS?

This partnership is important for TCS, for whom it is a key focus area, as emphasized by its Chairman N Chandrasekaran during the recent annual general meeting (AGM).

During the TCS AGM on June 10, Chandrasekaran, chairman, Tata Group said, “5G is new technology and TCS will play a significant role both in the development of firmware, which is required to develop the necessary technology (for 5G solutions). But most importantly, leveraging the 5G and create large number of applications in various sectors. This is an important growth area for TCS.”

The partnership is clearly in line with this vision, where TCS can strengthen its capabilities and eventually scale its solutions and gain market share when 5G deployment gains pace in India and globally.

Ray Wang, Principal Analyst & Founder, Constellation Research, a research and advisory firm, said that TCS’ O-RAN based solution is a key capability in their telecom stack that will give Airtel a competitive advantage and drive down the cost of 5G deployment in India.

“(With this partnership) TCS also gains the capability to help other telcos with both the technology and implementation and Airtel will save a lot of time and money in the rollout,” Wang added.

A Bengaluru-based analyst explained that 5G implementation has more software component than 4G and hence there is more need for technology service providers. Without partnerships with IT firms, telcos will run into integration challenges, making this partnership important, given the huge opportunity 5G provides.

5G implementation market

An analysis by UBS pegs that 5G rollout is a $30 billion opportunity for Indian IT firms. The market is clearly huge and it is not lost on the IT service providers.

For instance Tech Mahindra has partnered with Japanese telecom major Rakuten for 5G implementation. According to several media reports, Tech Mahindra wants to partner with the telecom major Jio for 5G implementation. Reliance-owned Jio, which is one of the key players in the 5G space, is expected to launch 5G smartphone in partnership with Google this week, according to reports.

Globally too, such partnerships are common place and will likely continue. For instance, Vodafone has partnered with Capgemini for 5G implementation.

But…

Though the opportunity is huge, benefits from these partnerships are unlikely to be significant, point out some.

Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO, Everest Group, said, “These partnership rarely mean very much and are mostly a signaling vehicle to show that the parties are committed to 5G. That is not to say that TCS will not capture some revenue from this but in the end Airtel will work with other vendors and TCS will work with other 5G networks. So the partnership is good publicity but is unlikely to contribute significantly to either party’s market success.”

Telcos like Airtel, Jio and Vodafone work with major IT service providers, and other players will get a part of the pie too.

In terms of revenues too, it might not amount to a significant value, at least not in the beginning. “This is a new technology and there is a lot of uncertainty between pilot to implementation. So this would be a step by step process,” explained Pareekh Jain, founder, Pareekh Consulting.

Bharti Airtel on Monday said its special panel of directors has approved allotment of 36.4 million equity shares on a preferential basis to Warburg Pincus affiliate at Rs 600 issue price, as partial consideration towards Bharti Telemedia deal.

As per the contours of the recently-announced deal, Bharti Airtel will acquire a 20 percent stake in its DTH arm Bharti Telemedia from Warburg Pincus affiliate Lion Meadow Investment Ltd for about Rs 3,126 crore.

""...the ''Special Committee of Directors for Fund Raising'' of the company has, at its meeting held today, March 22, 2021, approved the allotment of 3,64,69,913 equity shares of the face value of Rs 5 each fully paid up, on a preferential basis to Lion Meadow Investment Ltd, an affiliate of Warburg Pincus at an issue price of Rs 600 per equity share (including a premium of Rs 595 per equity share)...,"" Airtel said in a regulatory filing.

This is towards ""partial consideration other than in cash against the acquisition of 10,20,40,000 equity shares, constituting 20 percent of the equity share capital of Bharti Telemedia, by the company from Lion Meadow"", it informed.

As a result, Lion Meadow will hold about 0.664 percent of the post-issue equity share capital of the company.

The paid-up equity share capital of the company stands increased to Rs 2,746 crore entailing ""5,49,20,27,268 equity shares of Rs 5 each"".

Airtel had earlier stated that Bharti Telemedia transaction will be discharged primarily via issuance of about 3.64 crore equity shares of Airtel at a price of Rs 600 per share and up to Rs 1,037.8 crore in cash."

Telecom analysts believe that a sharp downward revision by the government in its telecom non-tax receipts for FY22 indicates that 5G spectrum sale in the 3.5 GHz band is unlikely in the next fiscal.

Budget documents released on February 1 show that the government has slashed its budgeted telecom non-tax receipts for FY22 by 60 percent to Rs 53,987 crore. In the previous budget (FY21), the government had set an ambitious revenue target of Rs 1.33 lakh crore, but had later revised it to Rs 33,737 crore.

""We believe 5G spectrum auction is unlikely in FY22. In the recently concluded auction, both Jio as well as Airtel invested large amounts and have increased their 4G coverage as well as capacity spectrum holdings. Over the next few months the companies are likely to focus on putting this spectrum to use and strengthen their 4G networks,"" said Kunal Vora, Senior Telecom Analyst, BNP Paribas.

He added, ""Recently Bharti Airtel has said India will be 5G ready in 2-3 years, and we believe that operators will look to improve 4G monetisation rather than invest in 5G in FY22. The government’s revenue expectations from telecoms is more realistic in FY22 compared to FY21, and we believe it does not include 5G spectrum auction proceeds.""

The government usually earns its non-tax revenue from the telecom operators in the form of licence fees and spectrum usage charges. It also earns its non-tax revenue from the proceeds of spectrum auction AGR payment.

In FY21 ending March 31, 2021, the government is expected to net over Rs 20,000 crore as upfront payment from telcos for the 4G airwaves auction that concluded on March 2.

The government had auctioned airwaves across seven bands worth Rs 3.92 lakh crore and had managed to receive bids for spectrum worth Rs 77,814.80 crore by beating analysts expectations.

Ankit Jain, Vice-President, Corporate Ratings, ICRA noted, ""The non-tax revenue receipts for GoI for FY21 are likely to be higher than the revised estimates. In the event no AGR payments are required to be made by the telcos in the current fiscal, the non-tax receipts are expected to be around Rs 45,000-50,000 crore.""

""This includes a major part of the upfront payment of the recently concluded spectrum auctions to be made by March 31, 2021, with some spillover to FY22 for spectrum which will be available at a later date. For FY22, the estimated non-tax receipts are expected to be around Rs 40,000-45,000 crore in the absence of 5G-spectrum auctions,"" he added.

Differing in view, Isha Chaudhary, Director, CRISIL Research, noted, ""The demand notices for the upfront payment from the recently concluded spectrum auctions were issued soon after the auctions. Thus the proceeds from the same will add to the government’s current year revenues from the telecom sector resulting in revenues surpassing Rs 50,000 crore against revised estimated of Rs 33,737 crore.""

In FY22, the government has budgeted Rs.53,987 crore, of which around Rs 30,000-35,000 crore is expected to be from licence fees, spectrum usage charges and AGR dues instalments. This leaves a balance of around Rs 20,000 crore of revenue from other areas. However, the upfront payment from 5G auctions is likely to garner significantly larger amount and hence if 5G auctions do take place, the government may end up getting higher collections than the budgeted estimate in FY22, she added.

Given the pace of 5G deployments in other major economies and Indian Telcos getting their networks 5G ready, the government is likely to try to schedule the 5G spectrum auctions in the current year itself, Isha concluded.

Lakhs of consumers around the country suffered an outage on messaging services affecting One Time Password (OTP) delivery for a host of services such as bank transactions, credit card payments, railway ticket bookings and even Co-WIN vaccine registrations.

Wondering why it happened?

From 12 am on March 8, the telecommunication companies implemented the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI's) regulations after much delay.

The regulations were notified in 2018 to curb the problem of Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC) or spam. According to TRAI’s regulation on unsolicited commercial communication, content scrubbing is the process where telcos verify every SMS content with a registered template before delivering it.

Which services were disrupted?

Reportedly, services including Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Aadhaar enabled Payments (AePS), net banking, and credit card payments were disrupted due to the outage. Other services like railway booking and Co-WIN vaccine registrations were also obstructed.

Private and public banks also complained of disruption in banking services and held the telcos responsible for the disruptions. According to a report in the Economic Times, approximately 40 percent of the nearly one billion daily average commercial SMSes failed to deliver. It further noted that banks witnessed a failure rate of about 25 percent until the evening of March 8, 2021.

What are the new regulations?

In 2018, TRAI noted that the 'Do Not Disturb' service under regulations made in 2010 had twenty-three crore subscribers but the problem of pesky messaging was not fully contained because unscrupulous elements started obtaining customers' consent, often surreptitiously, or resorted to using of unregistered telemarketers that call or message from a ten-digit number. In more recent times, the incidence of fraud calls had also risen.

TRAI's new regulations were formulated leveraging technology which offered a more agile process to deal with the dynamic nature of this problem.

The regulations require that consent be explicitly recorded by a third party and be activated only after subscribers' confirmation. Furthermore, the subscriber is given the option to revoke his or her consent, if it's abused or is no longer relevant.

However, the striking feature of the regulation is the Distributed Ledger Technology (or blockchain) which means that companies, banks, telemarketers, and government agencies are required to register themselves with the telecom service providers and also get their templates or message contents registered for successful delivery to the consumer. This process is called content scrubbing.

In case the templates or the sender isn't registered, the telecom service provider blocks the delivery of such a message to control spam messaging. The rationale behind the regulations is to check the pesky calls and messages sent to customers and to crack down on financial frauds and erring telemarketers.

""It appears to be the first instance anywhere in the world to

use this technology at such a scale in the telecom sector."" TRAI had said at the time of notifying the regulations in 2018.

The Blame Game

On March 8, the telecom companies reportedly took the companies, banks, and governmental agencies by surprise when it implemented these regulations. Following the outage, telecom companies were blamed for the faulty implementation of the regulations.

In November 2020, TRAI had imposed a Rs 35 crore collective penalty on eight operators including Vodafone Idea, Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL), and Bharti Airtel for Telecom Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR) violations, which allowed cybercriminals to dupe customers via fake SMSes.

In February 2021, the Delhi High court also directed TRAI to ensure ""complete and strict"" compliance with these regulations notified about three years ago.

Reportedly, the Indian Banks' Association requested a postponement of these regulations with TRAI after its implementation on March 8. However, an official at TRAI told the Economic Times that constant reminders were sent to banks regarding the impending deadline for the past 15 days. “We haven’t received any official complaint about any disruption,” the official added.

Telecom companies also pushed back and blamed the companies for failing to comply with the registration forms within the specified time. Earlier in January, it was reported that telecom companies will start filtering commercial SMSes with unregistered content in a bid to check the flow of spam messages."

Following the conclusion of the latest spectrum auction held on March 1-2, the Department of Telecom (DoT) has sent notices to the telecom companies demanding Rs 21,919 crore as upfront payment for the spectrum bought.

The DoT in separate notices to three telecom giants sought Rs 15,019.84 crore from Jio, Rs 6323.98 crore from Airtel, and Rs 574.65 from Vodafone Idea, as upfront payment if the telcos choose the spread their dues over 16 years, the Economic Times reported.

As a standard procedure for the spectrum auction, the buyers had an option to pay upfront 50 percent of the final bid for 1,800, 2,100, 2,300, and 2,500MHz bands, and the remaining amount can be paid in equated 16 installments over a period of two years at the interest rate of 7.3 percent, following the two years moratorium. For 700, 800, and 900MHz bands, the upfront amount was 25 percent of the successful bid.

The buyers were also required to pay three percent of the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) excluding wireline services as spectrum usage charges for the spectrum won through this auction.

The government managed to sell 855.60 megahertz (MHz) of the spectrum which is 37 percent of the offered 2308.80 MHz by volume, and 19 percent by value as compared to the last auction held in 2016 where, of the 2,354.75MHz auctioned, about 41 percent or 964.80MHz was acquired in terms of quantity and 12 percent or Rs 65,789 crore by value.

In the current auction, Reliance Jio emerged as the biggest bidder, acquiring 488.35 MHz for Rs 57,122.65 crore, followed by Bharti Airtel which took 355.45 MHz for Rs 18,698.75 crore, and Vodafone Idea with 11.80 MHz for Rs 1,993.40 crore.

The DoT has sent the total amount of the spectrum bought and the outstanding upfront amount if they choose to exercise the defer payment option.

The latest auction of fourth-generation (4G) telecom spectrum held this month attracted bids worth Rs 77,814.80 crore, 18 percent more than the previous sale of airwaves to mobile phone service providers in October 2016.

Winners of the auction, held on March 1-2, acquired 855.60 megahertz (MHz), which is 37 percent of the offered 2308.80 MHz by volume, and 19 percent by value. In 2016, Of the 2,354.75MHz auctioned, about 41 percent or 964.80MHz was acquired in terms of quantity and 12 percent or Rs 65,789 crore by value.

Only three companies participated in latest auction, compared with seven bidders in 2016.

This year, Reliance Jio emerged as the biggest bidder, acquiring 488.35 MHz for Rs 57,122.65 crore, followed by Bharti Airtel which took 355.45 MHz for Rs 18,698.75 crore, and Vodafone Idea with 11.80 MHz for Rs 1,993.40 crore.

Spectrums are invisible radio frequencies that transmit wireless signals to our devices, that help us make calls through smartphones and browse the internet. These are split into several bands. These are low-band spectrum up to 3GHz, mid-band between 3GHz and 24GHz, and high-band that is 24GHz and more.

In 2021, the government auctioned spectrum across seven bands -- 700 MHz, 800MHz, 900MHz, 1,800MHz, 2,100MHz, 2,300MHz, and 2,500MHz. Participants did not bid for 700 MHz and 2500 MHz bands.

Analysts said Bharti Airtel and Jio did well to acquire spectrum that will improve their networks.

“Bharti Airtel has taken the lead on overall spectrum holding by judiciously covering the gaps in coverage as well as capacity in 19 out of 22 circles,” states a report by Kotak Institutional Equities. “Jio has expanded its own subGHz footprint meaningfully to provide for the expiring bandwidth and enhanced its capacity to uniform levels in 1800/2300 MHz bands across all circles. VIL has acquired modest capacity in five circles only,” the report notes.

“The spectrum additions will allow Bharti and Jio to enhance their user experience further, compounding woes for VIL,” the report highlights further.

India has suffered from a chronic shortage of spectrum which was dealt decisively through the mega auction of spectrum held in October 2016, the Department of Telecommunicactions Annual report 2016-17, had stated. The spectrum sold during the auction of 2016 was higher compared to the cumulatively (929MHz) sale reported during the four auctions held between 2012 and 2015, the report highlighted.

The spectrum assigned to the successful bidders in 2021 will be valid for 20 years. The Spectrum Usage Charges for the spectrum acquired in this auction will be payable at the rate of 3% of Adjusted Gross Revenue of the licensee, excluding revenue from wireline services.

“Indian telcos’ spectrum acquisition can be accommodated in their current ratings, particularly amid the stabilizing competitive environment,” said Sweta Patodia, Analyst, Corporate Finance Group, Moody’s Investors Service. “Some have recently raised funds while others have large cash holdings to support the acquisitions. The spectrum renewals will help incumbents protect their market positions while additional bandwidth purchases will drive improved network coverage.”

The 4G telecom spectrum auction 2021 ended on March 2 with the government receiving bids worth Rs 77,814.80 crore.

Bids worth Rs 668. 20 crore were made on the second day of the auction, which saw bids worth ₹77,146 crore on the first day.

Reliance Jio emerged as the biggest buyer by acquiring a total of 488.35 MHz of spectrum for Rs 57,122.65 crore, followed by Bharti Airtel with 355.45 MHz at Rs 18,698.75 crore, and Vodafone Idea with 11.80 MHz for Rs 1,993.40 crore, Telecom Secretary Anshul Prakash said.

The secretary said out of 2308.80 MHz of spectrum put for auction, the government has received bids for 855.60 MHz.

The 2300 MHz band turned out to be the most sought after with 89.29 percent spectrum being sold. Of 560 MHz spectrum put for auction under the 2300 MHz band, 500 MHz found takers, the Ministry of Communications said in a statement.

In the 800 MHz band, 65 percent of the available spectrum was sold. In the 1800 MHz band, 43 percent of spectrum was sold. In the 900 MHz band, 39 percent of spectrum was sold, and in the 2100 MHz band, 9 percent of spectrum was sold.

The department of telecommunications (DoT) aimed to raise at least ₹3.92 lakh crore by auctioning the entire spectrum.

There were only three bidders - Airtel, Vi, and Reliance Jio - this year, as against seven bidders during the last spectrum auction in 2016.

The DoT auctioned over 2,308 units of spectrum across the 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz and 2500 MHz bands.

Bids were received for radio airwaves in the 800MHz, 900MHz, 1,800MHz, 2,100MHz and 2,300MHz bands. Spectrum in the 700MHz and 2,500MHz bands remained unsold.

As widely expected, the 700 MHz band did not find any takers due to its high base price (nearly 2 lakh crore) like the 2016 spectrum auction.

Experts said the 700 MHz airwaves will remain largely unsold as it can be used for the deployment of the 5G technology thus making it the most expensive band.

The telecom secretary indicated that the 700MHz band, which remained unsold, could be used for 5G auction. He further indicated that the unsold spectrum in the 700 and 2,500 MHz will be sent to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India for a fresh reference.

""700 MHz band went unsold as expected despite a 40-45% reduction in base price over the last auction in 2016. However, we expect the government to further reduce the price of this band and release it for 5G auctions when the telcos may pick up some pockets.

""The band has excellent propagation characteristics (2x and 3x the length of a mid-band spectrum in urban and rural areas, respectively) and can be used in conjunction with mid-band for the launch of 5G. Given the higher number of sites required for 5G, the use of 700 MHZ band can potentially reduce the network capex for telcos by 20-30 percent according to our initial estimates,"" noted Isha Chaudhary, Director, CRISIL Research.

The telecom secretary said Reliance Jio bought spectrum in 800 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2300MHz bands. Vodafone Idea bid only in 900MHz and 1800 MHz bands, while Bharti Airtel spread its requirement across 5 bands - 800 MHz,900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz and 2300MHz.

Commenting on the acquiring pattern of the telcos, Prakash said, “The telcos seemed to have consolidated their positions in the bands in which they were operating and have taken spectrum in the bands in which they felt they had less spectrum.

Bharti Airtel on March 2 confirmed that it had spent Rs 18,699 crore in the spectrum auction. It confirmed acquiring 355.45 MHz spectrum across Sub GHz, mid band and 2300 MHz bands.

Airtel also confirmed not biding for the 700 MHz airwave band owing to its high reserve price.

Telecom Secretary Anshul Prakash had said with the spectrum auction, the Union government is expecting to generate a revenue of Rs 12,000-13,000 crore in FY21.

“If we exclude the 700 and 2500 MHz bands, the bidding in the rest of the bands represents 60 percent of spectrum put to auction,” he said on March 1.

Having collected nearly ₹77,146 crore, Union communications minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said on March 1 that the auctions had exceeded the government's estimates of ₹45,000 crore on day one of the auction.

The auction lasted six rounds, with four rounds of bidding on day 1 and two on day 2.

The spectrum bought by the telcos will be valid for 20 years.

""The auction bids of Rs 77,814 crore exceeded expectations by at least 50 percent owing to higher interest in Sub-GHz band which constitutes over 55 percent of the total bids received. Assuming players opt for deferred payment mode which is usually the case, we expect the total upfront payments to be Rs 27,000-28,000 crore,"" said Chaudhary.

According to the DOT, the payment is to be made in 10 days post the issue of demand notice which is expected to be released within the next 7-10 days and will remain a key moniterable. Any delay in the release of demand notice would lead to collections slipping to next fiscal impacting government revenues for the current fiscal, she added.

Telcos need to pay upfront 25 percent of spectrum won in the 700 MHz, 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands, and 50 percent of the rest of the bands (1800, 2100, 2300, and 2500 MHz bands). The rest is to be paid in 16 annual instalments after a two-year moratorium.

Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC) for the spectrum acquired in this auction will be payable at the rate of 3% of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) of the licensee, excluding revenue from wireline services, the statement noted.

Bharti Airtel is seeing increasing demand for 'hybrid' solutions that accommodate packages for work-from-home and work-from-office models as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on while vaccination efforts are underway.

Airtel CPO Adarsh Nair told Mint that the telco is working on ""hybrid work models"" for companies.

These packages Nair said include solutions for cloud platforms, cybersecurity software, and video conferencing. He added that the telco would ""buy new products as demand evolves.""

The plan he noted is two-fold – first to better package existing technologies, and secondly to buy and package additional technologies into new products as required.

He also hinted at Airtel launching ""adtech in a big way"" in order to ""monetise demand for digital services from premium customers.""

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

On how these plans will be sold, Nair said the existing infrastructure of direct-to-home, pre-paid, and post-paid services will be used to connect the telco's large customer base with enterprises - through adtech.

""For instance, Airtel will use the adtech platform to link over-the-top (OTT) content player Hotstar’s offerings, bundled with other plans, to offer to its premium customers,"" Nair said.

Funding for adtech technology will be drawn from Airtel's core business with marginal investment, he added.

Airtel is the second-largest telecom operator in India on basis of customers. Among its corporate customers are more than a million startups and small and medium businesses and over 2,500 large businesses.

Nair hinted at other ""five-six incubations like adtech"" which are in the works but did not elaborate."

Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Thursday announced it has successfully demonstrated live 5G service over a commercial network in Hyderabad city, underlining the 5G readiness of its network across domains.

The full impact of the 5G experience, though, would be available to Airtel customers when adequate spectrum is available, and government approvals are received.

The demonstration in Hyderabad has highlighted the company's technology capabilities, Airtel said.

Bharti Airtel MD and CEO, Gopal Vittal, said: ""I am very proud of our engineers who have worked tirelessly to showcase this incredible capability in Tech City, Hyderabad today. Every one of our investments is future proofed as this game changing test in Hyderabad proves"".

Vittal added: ""With Airtel being the first operator to demonstrate this capability, we have shown again that we have always been the first in India to pioneer new technologies in our quest for empowering Indians everywhere.""

India has the potential to become a global hub for 5G innovation, he said adding this would require the coming together of ecosystem – applications, devices and network innovation.

""We are more than ready to do our bit,"" Vittal said.

The demonstration of live 5G service in Hyderabad was conducted over an existing liberalised spectrum in the 1800 MHz band.

""Using a first of its kind, dynamic spectrum sharing, Airtel seamlessly operated 5G and 4G concurrently within the same spectrum block,"" Airtel said."

Telecom analysts are expecting a very mild response for the second telecom spectrum auction, especially for the 700MHz (Megahertz) band.

On December 16, the Union Cabinet approved the auction of 2251.25 MHz of spectrum by the end of FY21, Telecom and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said.

“Spectrum will be offered for assignment for validity period of 20 years. A total of 2251.25 MHz is being offered with total valuation of Rs. 3.92 lakh crore (at reserve price),” the government said in an official statement.

The Department of Telecommunication (DoT) will auction the spectrum in seven frequency bands - 700MHz, 800MHz, 900MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz and 2500MHz, Prasad said.

The auction is slated to be held in the month of March in 2021. The notice inviting applications is expected by the end of this month.

""ICRA expects moderate participation in the upcoming spectrum auctions, largely limited to renewal of the expiries primarily in the 800 MHz and 1800 MHz bands, along with some consolidation of spectrum holdings. ICRA does not foresee any major participation in the 700 MHz band,"" said Ankit Jain, Assistant Vice President, ICRA Ltd.

""The auction is expected to fetch Rs 55,000 – 60,000 crore to the exchequer and even at this participation, the industry will have to shelve out around Rs 20,000-25,000 crore upfront, while the balance will have to be paid over 16 years, after a two-year moratorium,"" Jain added.

Kunal Vora, Senior Telecom Analyst, BNP Paribas India, said: ""Indian telecom industry has consolidated into three private sector operators, these operators have already acquired large quantity of spectrum and their return on investment is still low.""

""We believe demand for spectrum will be well below supply at current reserve price and do not expect much competition. Like the previous auction we expect most spectrum to remain unsold, especially the 700Mhz spectrum which is the most expensive. Operators will look to acquire 800Mhz/900Mhz spectrum which is coming up for renewal and might also look to add some spectrum in higher frequency in circles in which they are facing network congestion,"" Vora added.

According to industry experts, telecom companies will participate in the upcoming auction primarily to plug for the capacity, renewal, and coverage gaps. Very little bidding for the 700MHz band is expected, and Jio may turn out to be the biggest possible bidder. Further the 5G spectrum auction can be expected in the second half of FY22.

""Bharti Airtel has already bought spectrum from Tata Tele, Telenor, and Videocon in these circles, and thus does not need to renew its entire spectrum. In our base case, we estimate Bharti to buy spectrum worth only Rs 5,800 crore in the upcoming auctions. Vodafone Idea has Rs 10,000 crore worth of spectrum coming up for renewal; however, the Vodafone and Idea merger has added significant spectrum in VIL, and it may require to buy spectrum worth only Rs 1,900 crore in the upcoming auctions,"" ICIC Securities said in a research note.

The DoT had last conducted the spectrum auction in FY17 with a base price target of Rs. 5.63 lakh crore and had managed to raise around Rs 65,000 crore. The government had then put to auction 2355 MHz of spectrum and had sold 965 MHz across seven bands."

Reliance Jio Infocom (RJio) has accused Airtel and Vodafone Idea (Vi) of spreading false rumours about the company during the ongoing protests by farmers against the new farm reform laws.

It has asked the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to take strict action against the two entities, claiming that they are resorting to unethical ways to spread rumours that Reliance stands to gain from the new farm bills. The controversial farm reform laws have triggered widespread farmer protests across North India.

""These companies continue to remain directly/indirectly involved in supporting and furthering insinuations and false and frivolous rumours of Reliance being an undue beneficiary in the farm bills,"" it said.

The telco also laid blame on these campaigns as one of the main reasons for ""large number of port-out requests"".

According to RJio, customers are citing these campaigns as the sole reason for porting out of Jio without having any complaints or other issues related to its services.

""We submit that Airtel and Vi remain unabated in pursuit, this vicious and divisive campaign through its employees, agents, and retailers. They are inciting the public by making preposterous claims that migrating Jio mobile numbers to their network would be an act to support farmers protests,"" it said in its complaint to TRAI.

Additionally, RJio has also accused its rival companies of using the farmers’ protest as a means to campaign and malign RJio. The operators, through various Mobile Number Portability (MNP) campaigns, are using social platforms and asking RJio subscribers to port to Airtel and Vodafone, it alleged in the letter.

Although industry's overall wireless subscribers rose nearly 3.5 million in July -- the first month of such gains since February -- the total `active subscribers'' count in July actually fell 2.1 million, as per TRAI data.

""Industry''s active subscriber base...in July was down 2.1 million at 956 million after decline of 2.8 million month-on-month in June,"" Axis Capital said in its recent report, crunching TRAI''s monthly data.

Active subscribers are calculated based on reported Visitor Location Register (VLR), a key metric reflecting the number of active users on a mobile network.

""As per TRAI data, RJio gained 2.5 million active subscribers, while Airtel/ VI lost 0.4/ 3.8 million active subscribers in July. Airtel''s reported subscriber addition was up 3.3 mn month-on-month offset by reduction in VLR by 114 bps (basis points),"" Axis report said.

As per the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), out of the total wireless subscribers of about 1,144 million, 955.8 million wireless subscribers were active (measured on the date of peak VLR) in July 2020.

The proportion of active wireless subscribers was nearly 83.54 percent of the total wireless subscriber base, TRAI said.

""Bharti Airtel has the maximum proportion (97 percent) of its active wireless subscribers as against its total wireless subscribers on the date of peak VLR in the month of July 20,"" TRAI said.

Against this, the proportion of active users for Reliance Jio was at about 78 percent and for Vodafone Idea at 89.3 percent, TRAI data showed.

In absolute terms, this pegged active subscriber count for Jio at 313 million users in July, as compared to Airtel''s 310 million users, and VIL''s 269 million.

In June this year, Airtel had led the tally with 311 million active users, against Jio''s 310 million and VIL''s 273 million, as per Axis Capital report.

In an earlier report, Axis Capital had attributed Jio''s lower active user ratio to multi factors such as data-only subscribers being higher on the network (meaning devices may be closed at the time of collection of data), rural users of JioPhone switching off devices at particular times, and its ""conservative churn policy"".

Meanwhile, Nomura, in its note on telecom subscriber numbers, said Jio was the only telco with higher active subscribers month-on-month this time, and had regained its lead in the category.

""R-Jio became the market leader in VLR subs once again with market share of 32.7 percent, after trailing Bharti narrowly in June. However, R-Jio''s VLR level at 78.1 percent continued to decline,"" it said.

Overall, Jio added 3.5 million wireless subscribers to surge past the 400 million mark, and continues to lead with highest monthly net adds among telcos.

On Airtel, Nomura report said Bharti''s active subscribers market share remained stable month-on-month at 32.5 percent, as it continues to have highest VLR level at 97 percent.

This move resolves the contentious priority plan issue, which saw TRAI initiating a probe into the telco’s claims of priority network and faster data speeds for premium customers.

Last month, the regulator had slapped a show cause notice on VIL over its priority mobile plan, saying the tariff offer lacked transparency and was ”misleading” and not in compliance with the regulatory framework.

TRAI, which had been probing VIL’s priority plan, had issued an elaborate 17-page notice to the telco on August 25 asking it to ""show cause"" by August 31.

The regulator also gave the telco time till September 4 to respond to its show cause notice on priority plan RedX.

Little after facing regulatory heat, VIL dropped its faster data speed claims which formed a prominent part of its pay-more-for-priority-treatment offering, and filed a revised plan with TRAI.

TRAI has now informed VIL that ”the authority has decided not to proceed with the investigation/ further inquiry”.

In Trai's letter, seen by PTI, the regulator noted that VIL has informed that the earlier RedX plan has been discontinued. It also informed a new tariff plan of RedX has been filed that excludes the claim of priority 4G network feature with faster speed.

”It has been further stated that VIL believes that the same would address the concerns of the authority and based on the same, VIL requested the authority to grant closure to the pending enquiry,” the regulator said closing the matter.

Earlier this month, VIL submitted a new RedX plan with Trai as it removed claims of faster data speeds – a major bone of contention.

The company’s website too had stopped touting claims of faster speeds for the RedX plan and instead spoke of benefits purely in terms of entertainment privileges (Netflix and Amazon Prime), travel privileges, mobility benefits and other privileges for the said offer.

Trai had been examining VIL’s priority plan RedX and Bharti Airtel Platinum offering to see if network preference to specific customers led to deterioration of services for other non-premium subscribers or violated any norms.

Bharti Airtel was not issued a show cause notice for its platinum plan. Airtel had withdrawn its platinum offering and offered to abide by TRAI’s views and hence the regulator did not proceed with further investigation on it.

Lower taxation and floor price can help restore the financial health of debt-ridden telecom companies, industry experts said on September 18.

Speaking at the ET Telecom Digital Telco Virtual Summit, Vodafone Idea CEO Ravinder Takkar said in the wake of AGR verdict, it is important that the National Communications Digital Policy 2018 is speedily implemented. ""Though this can only happen through a light-touch regulatory approach, along with lower taxation levels for the industry,"" Takkar said.

At present, the financially stressed industry pays more than Rs 30 of every Rs 100 earned toward telecom levies and taxes, as per an Economic Times report.

Bharti Infratel Chairman Akhil Gupta said setting a floor price as a temporary measure can help restore the financial health of the industry. ""A floor price should be fixed at least for the next three to four years. Post that, as things settle down, it can be taken off,"" he said during the summit.

Gupta said either telcos have to self-regulate or the regulator will need to step in to ensure there is no predatory pricing in this industry.

""Even when we are down to three private operators, I still see that trend continuing. We all keep saying that the current tariffs and the current average revenue per user (ARPU) are completely unsustainable. But we do not end up increasing the tariffs or thereby increasing the ARPUs,"" Gupta said.

Bharti Airtel’s chief executive Gopal Vittal called on the government to expedite policy measures to bring in affordable and easy access to connectivity. ""The most critical requirement for Digital India is easy and affordable access to the right of way (RoW) so that we can reach customers and give them services they deserve,” Vittal said during the virtual event.

The government on September 17 said telecom companies owe more than Rs 1.4 lakh crore as outstanding adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues.

The companies owe a combined Rs 143,271.74 crore, the Ministry of Communications said in a reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha. While Vodafone Idea owes Rs 54,754 crore as AGR-related dues, Bharti Airtel has an outstanding payment of 25,976 crore.

The Supreme Court’s decision to allow telcos to pay outstanding dues over 10 years will not be enough to help Vodafone Idea to stabilise its position, while Jio and Airtel are expected to strengthen their market shares through subscriber gains, Fitch Ratings has said.

It further said another tariff hike of at least 20 percent is probable in the next 12 months.

Vodafone Idea’s plan to raise funds through a mix of equity and debt is ""unlikely” to restore its competitive position and reverse subscriber losses, as the amount would not be sufficient for capex, it argued.

""We believe Vodafone Idea will gradually lose market share given its weak balance sheet and limited financial flexibility,” a Fitch release said, adding that Jio and Bharti, on the other hand, are expected to gain market share on the SC verdict.

Industry tariffs are expected to rise as users adopt higher-price 4G plans.

""We expect Jio and Bharti to increase their combined revenue market share to 75-80 percent from around 70 percent in the next 12-18 months, at the expense of Vodafone Idea, which will likely lose 50 million-70 million subscribers in the next 12 months; it lost about 155 million subscribers in the last nine quarters,” it said.

Reliance Jio could snap up more than half of Vodafone Idea’s subscriber losses, with the balance going to Bharti, the release added.

While Jio had posted Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) growth of 55 percent, and Bharti reported Indian mobile EBITDA growth of 35 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal, Vodafone Idea’s numbers remained stagnant, covering only half of its interest cost.

""Vodafone Idea’s auditor expressed material uncertainty over the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, which, the auditor said, depends on successful negotiations with Vodafone Idea’s lenders to waive their rights to repayment after breaches of covenants under its bank loans,” Fitch Ratings said.

At June end, it had a cash balance of $470 million (about Rs 3,454 crore) which was well short of short-term debt maturities and guarantees of $3.6 billion (about Rs 26,450 crore).

""It has so far paid about $1.1 billion of its total unpaid dues of $8.9 billion, and it will need to pay around $1-1.2 billion a year during FY2021-2031,” it said.

The Supreme Court’s latest ruling will allow Bharti Airtel to pay the remaining outstanding dues in 10 annual payments of about $600 million (about Rs 4,410 crore) starting March 2022 instead of a lump sum.

Bharti’s FY21 Indian mobile EBITDA is likely to improve by 30-40 percent on the back of improved margins following tariff hikes and 5-6 percent subscriber growth.

Fitch expects Jio’s FY21 mobile revenue to increase by 45-50 percent, driven by higher monthly average revenue per user (ARPU) and subscriber addition of about 40 million.

Vodafone Idea – whose ARPU is about 30 percent, lower than Bharti’s – could raise tariffs to improve cash flows.

As it is, all three telcos had simultaneously increased tariffs by an average of 30 percent in December 2019.

""We estimate industry ARPU to grow by around 10 percent in FY21, as users upgrade gradually to higher-tariff 4G price,” it said, citing Bharti’s stance that industry’s monthly ARPU needs to touch about Rs 200 and eventually Rs 300 for a sustainable business.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has granted Vodafone Idea additional time till September 4 to respond to its showcause notice on priority plan RedX, a source told PTI.

TRAI, last week, had slapped a showcause notice on Vodafone Idea (VIL) over its pay-more-for-priority-treatment mobile plan, saying the tariff offer ""lacks transparency"", is ""misleading"" and not in compliance with regulatory framework.

TRAI, which had been probing VIL’s priority plan, had issued an elaborate 17-page notice to the telco on August 25 asking it to ""show cause"" by August 31 ""as to why appropriate action should not be initiated against it for violating the extant regulatory framework by its RedX tariff plan....""

A source privy to the development said Vodafone Idea had approached the regulator asking for three weeks' additional time to reply to the showcause notice.

TRAI has now written back to the company, giving additional time till September 4 for replying to the showcause notice, the source said.

When contacted, Vodafone Idea declined to comment on the matter.

In the showcause notice to VIL, TRAI had said, ""The RedX Tariff offer lacks transparency and is misleading and not in compliance with regulatory principles of tariff assessment contained under Telecom Tariff Order, 1999 as amended from time to time.""

The sector regulator had said it is of the view that the ""claim of VIL for providing 'Priority 4G Network with faster data speeds' is not in compliance with the extant regulatory framework....""

It had said the RedX tariff offer is in contravention of specific clauses of the Telecom Tariff Order relating to protection of interests of the consumers.

VIL's RedX tariff offer ""violates the terms of license agreement"" and is not consistent with stipulated technical specifications, TRAI had said, adding that it also did not comply with the service quality norms.

Over the past weeks, TRAI had been probing Vodafone Idea's priority plan RedX and Bharti Airtel Platinum Offering to see if network preference to specific customers leads to deterioration of services for other non-premium subscribers or violates any norms.

Bharti Airtel, however, was not issued the showcause notice for its platinum plan, which was also under the regulator's lens.

Airtel had offered to abide by TRAI's views and also voluntarily modified its platinum offering suitably, and hence TRAI is not proceeding with further investigation on it."

The Rs 799 plan offers 150GB internet at up to 100Mbps speed with unlimited local and STD calls. Reliance Jio offers the same 100 Mbps speed but with unlimited data for Rs 699. For availing unlimited data on Airtel Xstream, customers need to pay an additional Rs 299 per month.

"August 26, 2020 04:31 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rs-100-per-gb-for-mobile-data-airtel-chairman-sunil-mittal-says-yes-5758491.html,"Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal hinted at an increase in mobile service prices in the next six months. This follows after he said that data at low rates are not sustainable for the telecom industry.

The chairman has recommended that instead of getting 16GB data for Rs. 160, users should only get 1.6GB at this price point. ""16 GB data consumption a month for Rs 160 is a tragedy,"" Mittal said.

""You either consume 1.6 GB of capacity per month either at this price point or you may prepare to pay a lot more. We are not wanting USD 50-60 like the US or Europe but certainly USD 2 for 16 GB a month is not sustainable,"" Mittal said at an event, according to a report by PTI.

Speaking on the average revenue per user (ARPU), a metric that is commonly used to assess the revenue generated by a telco (telecom) company, Mittal said that Airtel is expecting to cross Rs 200 in six months on digital content consumption.

Airtel reported an increase in the ARPU to Rs 157 in the first quarter ended June 30, 2020. This rise in ARPU came after the tariff hike by Bharti Airtel during December 2019.

""We need a Rs 300 ARPU in which you will still have lower end at Rs 100 a month with decent amount of data. But if your consumption is largely around watching TV, movies, entertainment and depriving other vital special services networks, then you need to pay for that,"" Mittal said at the launch of a book written by Bharti Enterprises executive Akhil Gupta, the report said.

""We are down to 2-3 players now. India is a very price-conscious market. In six months time, we should be crossing the mark of Rs 200 for sure and Rs 250 would be ideal,"" Mittal said, adding that businesses which are not in telecom should also look towards digital and should see solid ARPUs building up in the next 5-6 months for the industry to be sustainable."
"August 25, 2020 07:27 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/telecom-sector-could-be-reduced-to-2-companies-warns-bharti-airtels-sunil-mittal-5750331.html,"Amid the ongoing Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) case in the Supreme Court, the top boss of Bharti Airtel has warned that the telecom sector in the country could come down to only two companies due to the financial stress faced by the sector.

""We could well be down to two companies given the financial stress in the sector. Unless promoters of the third company decide to bring in large amounts of capital, sustainability will be in difficulty. Airtel has also been badly hit. We have managed to pump in new capital, rights issues and QIP placement. The third operator may want to do the same to raise capital,"" said Sunil Bharti Mittal Chairman, Bharti Airtel.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Mittal said that the AGR payments are huge which has put an extraordinary load of penalties and interest. These large amounts which are sucked of the industry would rather go into building 4G, 5G network.

""But we will have to bow before the orders of the highest court. Time alone will not be enough, there is an interest to be paid on staggered payment,"" Mittal said.

""This is done now, let's not have further litigation in the sectors. Can't afford to continue hammering on the spine of the digital sectors,"" he added.

It is to be noted that for Bharti Airtel, the total AGR demand came in at Rs 43,980 crore of which the telco has so far paid Rs 18,004 crore. It is now seeking a 15-year timeline to pay the remaining Rs 25,976 crore. For Vodafone Idea, the total AGR demand came in at Rs 58,254 crore with the company so far clearing Rs 7,854 crore. Like Bharti Airtel, it is also seeking at least a 15-year timeline to clear the remaining Rs 50,400 crore dues.

On the business front, Mittal hoped for solid ARPUs (Average Revenue Per User) building up in the next 5-6 months.

""Earning $2 for 16GB is not sustainable. We have to reach decent levels of ARPU. Need ARPU levels of Rs 300 a month for sustainability. If people are consuming content online, they need to be able to pay accordingly,"" he added.

Mittal said that the company will cross ARPUs of Rs 200 in 6 months.

""India is a price-sensitive market, in 6 months would ideally like to see move past ARPU levels of Rs 250.

Further, he also batted for clear regulations, policy stability and a predictable regulatory regime.

""We are going through throws of change and a different style of governance. The government should be less litigious with the industry. Once the government loses a case at a certain level, they should not look to take it to the last level,"" Mittal said.

He is of the view that the Taxpayers charter is a step in that direction. A similar situation required for regulatory space. The government should engage with the few players, settle disputes and focus on Vivad Se Vishwas, he added.

Further, Mittal said that there will be fundamental changes post the pandemic.

""We will see the advent of the digital world. The last 5 months have done what the last 5 years could not have done. We have seen increased activity by customers, saying goodbye to the physical world. People like me who never did e-commerce, are now fully reliant on it, a brilliant discovery even for my generation,"" Mittal said.

However, a lot more needs to be done on digital connectivity, digital medicine, and education, according to Mittal.

The regulator recently sent reminders to the two companies to submit the additional data to back their claims, the source told PTI.

Following this, Vodafone Idea has sent some information and sought time till August 20 to submit the rest, while Airtel's response is awaited. The source privy to the development said that the companies had made certain claims in the presentation before the regulator on August 10 and that TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) had asked all related data to be submitted.

A reminder was sent this week to the two companies to make all pending submissions, and record of discussion has also been circulated by TRAI. The regulator is expected to finalise its views in the next few days, the source added. TRAI has asked the two companies to give details on the source of data they presented, as also international reference or studies.

It has asked how the companies intend to accommodate disaster management and other emergency functions, especially keeping in mind needs of the Telecom Department and other agencies, given the backdrop of priority plans. Emails sent to Airtel and Vodafone Idea remained unanswered.

TRAI is currently probing Vodafone Idea's priority plan RedX and Bharti Airtel Platinum Offering to see if network preference to specific customers leads to deterioration of services for other non-premium subscribers or violates any norms.

The regulator had earlier shot off questions to the two operators asking them to explain their position on the controversial issue and provide relevant data to substantiate their claims.

In its presentation to TRAI on August 10, Airtel defended its platinum offering saying it was launched with bonafide understanding that regulator does not have concerns over such an offering as no objection had been raised on a similar plan by Vodafone Idea for 8-9 months.

Airtel had argued that operators often bundle their tariff plans and provide plan linked benefits with regard to content, devices, discounts for voice and data.

Vodafone Idea too had justified its pay-more-for-priority-experience plan offered to its subscribers and said that telecom operators faced a double whammy of having to make continuous investments in an era of call and data charges falling way below cost due to cut-throat competition.

Responding to questions raised by TRAI over the priority plans earlier, Vodafone Idea had argued that a new tariff plan is not a new service. Vodafone Idea has also countered TRAI's contention that the RedX plan that commits higher speeds should have been informed separately so different aspects could have been examined before such service was launched."

Telecom major Bharti Airtel and Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cloud service provider, announced a multi-year, strategic collaboration agreement (SCA) to offer cloud solutions to large and small enterprises in India.

Under this partnership, the two companies will offer industry-specific solutions to customers across different sectors including banking and financial services, manufacturing, IT/ITeS, and media and entertainment.

Puneet Chandok, President, India and South Asia, AWS, said in a virtual conference that they are seeing increasing adoption of its over 175 cloud offering among its customers for various reasons. This ranges from reducing the cost structure and risk to enabling connected car platforms for auto manufacturers.

Harmeen Mehta, CIO & Head – Cloud and Security Business, Bharti Airtel, said since the pandemic, digital adoption grew at the scale that has it has never seen before.

Digital transformation that used to happen over the period of 18 months is now happening every quarter, she said. “There have never been a better time than now to rethink policy.”

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

This comes at the back of accelerated adoption of digital at the back of COVID-19 by firms across sectors. Cloud, Mehta said, is even more critical and important. For the company, close 60 percent of revenue accrues from digital properties, she said.

Apart from AWS, Airtel has partnership with Google Cloud, which it announced in January. The deal enables Airtel to offer G-Suite services to small and medium businesses through Airtel integrated ICT portfolio. The services include Google’s intelligent apps such as Gmail, Google Docs and Google Drive on the cloud.

Mehta pointed out that the G-Suite offering will not overlap with AWS partnership. In addition just like how AWS work with multiple partners, Airtel will work with different partners as well, she added. But Mehta was quick to add that this partnership with AWS is strategic and deep.

Airtel serves over 2,500 large enterprises and more than a million emerging businesses and companies with an integrated product portfolio, including Airtel Cloud, a multi-cloud product and solutions business, the company said in a statement.

Indian public cloud services market is likely to touch $7.1 billion by 2024, growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.3 percent, according to an IDC report."

There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Economic and business activities are slowly restarting outside containment zones, and partial movement has resumed within states in the third phase of lockdown.

The government last week announced extension of the nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic for two more weeks till May 17, and issued new guidelines permitting different sets of relaxations in green, red, and orange zones, thus paving the way for a staggered exit while reopening the economy.

As on early Thursday, the death toll due to coronavirus pandemic stood at 1,783, while the cases have risen to 52,952 in the country.

While the two refused to comment on discussions they had with Sitharaman, Mittal said the telecom sector has been under stress for the last three-and-a-half years and the government should focus on its sustainability.

Mittal, who heads mobile service major Bharti Airtel, first met Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash before going for the meeting with the finance minister.

Birla, who is the chairman of Vodafone Idea, had met the telecom secretary on February 18.

It was not immediately clear if the two telecom tycoons met Sitharaman together or separately.

Emerging out of the North Block after meeting Sitharaman, Mittal told reporters that the issue of pending dues arising out of the Supreme Court ruling on Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) was not discussed.

The telecom industry, he said, is vital to India's digital agenda.

""This industry is very vital to the nation's digital agenda, and many other industries that ride on it....employment, government taxes...the only thing government needs to focus on is how to ensure sustainiability of the sector,"" Mittal said.

Mittal -- whose company Bharti Airtel is confronted with over Rs 35,000 crore of statutory dues -- did not elaborate on the relief mechanism that the telco is pitching for. The industry as such has been batting for reduction in levies like licence fee and spectrum charges.

Mittal said Airtel has already announced its plans to pay the dues that arose from the apex court ruling. The company is calculating its liability, he added.

Airtel has so far paid Rs 10,000 crore out of its estimated liability of over Rs 35,000 crore.

""We have made statement that we are working on the calculation so as soon as it is ready...,"" he said.

Vodafone Idea Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla refused to comment on whether the company has approached the government for relief on the timelines for the statutory payment, and whether he has received any assurances in return.

Asked about the mounting stress in the telecom sector, Birla said, ""That is in the public domain...there is no other insight I can add.""

On whether it is a do-or-die moment for telecom companies like Vodafone Idea, Birla said, ""Let us see.""

Vodafone Idea on Monday paid Rs 2,500 crore to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and promised to pay another Rs 1,000 crore before the end of the week.

But the amount paid for now is less than 5 per cent of the dues that the DoT estimates the company owes to the government following the Supreme Court ruling that asked for including non-core revenues of telcos in computing statutory payments such as licence fee and spectrum charges.

The Supreme Court on Monday refused to stop the telecom department from taking any coercive steps for recovery of dues from Vodafone Idea.

In December, Birla had said Vodafone Idea may have to shut down if there is no relief on statutory dues. ""If we are not getting anything, then I think it is the end of the story for Vodafone Idea,"" Birla had said. ""It does not make sense to put good money after bad... We will shut shop.""

After a Supreme Court rap on February 14 for missing the payment deadline, top telecom firms Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices earlier this week scrambled to pay a part of their outstanding dues.

Airtel -- which recently raised USD 3 billion -- has paid Rs 10,000 crore to the government, and said it will clear the remaining dues before the next date of hearing on March 17. Vodafone Idea, however, has so far not provided a clear deadline for making balance payments.

Tata Teleservices paid Rs 2,197 crore, the entire outstanding it believes to have arisen after the October ruling of the apex court for calculating dues after adding non-telecom revenues. It has also submitted to DoT the details of calculations in support of the payment.

The DoT -- which last week drew flak for ordering no coercive action even after telcos missed the January 23 payment deadline set by the Supreme Court -- had been mulling the option of encashing bank guarantees given by firms when they got telecom licences, as none of the telcos paid the full amount. The telecom department would seek opinion from the law ministry on the issue, sources said.

The Supreme Court, last week, rejected a plea by companies such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea for extension in the payment schedule and asked all of them to deposit an estimated Rs 1.47 lakh crore in past dues for spectrum and licences. It threatened to initiate contempt proceedings against top executives of these firms for non-payment.

Some telecom firms are already struggling with mounting losses and debt and the additional liability has raised concerns of them defaulting on existing loans. Of the estimated dues that include interest and penalty for late payments, Airtel and Vodafone Idea owe about 60 per cent."

Bharti Airtel's adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues are likely to increase if it has to clear a significant portion of Videocon Telecommunications's dues as well, according to a report by The Economic Times.

Airtel bought 25 Mhz of spectrum in the 1800 Mhz band from Videocon in March 2016.

Airtel also purchased spectrum from Aircel. But, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) may not include Aircel’s dues to Airtel’s bill, government officials told the publication.

The DoT has pegged Airtel’s AGR dues at around Rs 35,586 crore, Videocon’s liabilities at 2,041 crore and Aircel’s dues at Rs 11,950 crore. Airtel, on February 17, paid Rs 10,000 crore to the DoT.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

According to trading rules set in 2015, the company selling the airwaves are required to clear any liabilities before the spectrum deal. But, if charges are discovered later, the telecom regulator can ask either the seller or the buyer to make the payment, ET added.

Airtel, in 2016, bought 23 Mhz spectrum in the 4G band of 2300 Mhz from Aircel. But, the DoT may not transfer the dues to Airtel, the report said.

""This is because most of the defunct telco's dues comes from its 2G and 3G airwaves whereas Airtel had picked up the barely used 4G spectrum,"" an industry source told the paper.

The telecom regulator may not add Reliance Communications' AGR dues of Rs 21,921 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm’s bill either, the report said.

“A subsequent Supreme Court judgement of July 2019 had dismissed DoT’s challenge of the tribunal’s order,” an official told The Economic Times.

Telecom operators Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices are likely to make payment for adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues on Monday to avoid stringent punitive action from the Telecom Department, according to official sources.

The three companies are jointly liable to pay dues of over Rs 1 lakh crore, but they have informed the Department of Telecom (DoT) of making only partial payment, as per their representatives.

""Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices have said that they will make payments on Monday. DoT will take action after evaluating the amount paid by them,"" an official source told PTI.

Earlier on Friday, Bharti Airtel offered the DoT to pay Rs 10,000 crore by February 20, but a DoT official said that the department can't grant any extension.

Vodafone Idea on Saturday said that it is assessing the amount that can be paid towards AGR dues, even as it flagged concerns over the continuation of its business.

Telecom operators are collectively liable to pay Rs 1.47 lakh crore in AGR dues as per the Supreme Court order dated October 24, 2019. The deadline to pay the amount ended on January 23, but none of the telecom operators, except Reliance Jio, paid the amount.

Even state-owned BSNL and MTNL did not pay the dues.

As per the last available estimates, Airtel owes nearly Rs 35,586 crore, including licence fee and spectrum usage charges, to the government.

Vodafone Idea is staring at dues worth Rs 53,000 crore, which includes up to Rs 24,729 crore of spectrum dues and another Rs 28,309 crore in licence fee. Tata Teleservices owes around Rs 13,800 crore, BSNL Rs 4,989 crore and MTNL Rs 3,122 crore.

Out of Rs 1.47 lakh crore, around Rs 1.13 lakh crore is likely to be recovered, as other companies, which are liable to pay AGR dues, have folded up their businesses.

Reliance Communications and Aircel are going through insolvency proceedings.

The apex court on Friday came down heavily on the Telecom Department for not taking steps to recover statutory dues, estimated to be around Rs 1.47 lakh crore from operators.

The DoT issued fifth and final notice to telecom operators on February 14 for making payment on the same day, but none of the companies paid the dues.

When asked about telecom operators having sought time to assess the amount they have to pay, the DoT official said that the court gave them three months to do so and even after missing January 23 deadline telecom operators had sufficient time to calculate their dues.

""Before the due date, DoT has sent telecom operators 4 notices and reminders to pay to avoid punitive action under license condition. After court order on modification plea, telecom players are not left with any excuse to delay the payment and the DoT can take action against them without serving any further notice,"" the source said.

The apex court pulled up telecom operators and the government on non-payment of AGR dues despite its order. It has asked managing directors and directors of the company to be present in person before court on the next hearing, scheduled for March 17, in case there is violation of its order in the AGR case.

Public sector companies, that do not sell telecom services, owe DoT around Rs 2.65 lakh crore, with GAIL India alone owing around 65 per cent of the total amount. However, these PSUs have the option to approach court for a legal recourse."

The report noted that while the price hike won’t impact Tata Sky users who use it regularly, it would affect users who opt to use the service for just a day or two.

Firdous Fatima, a Tata Sky representative, told DreamDTH, “We are revising the minimum recharge amount on our platform from the current Rs 20 to Rs 50. Starting February 11, 2020, recharges below Rs 50 wouldn’t be allowed/successful both on Tata Sky platforms as well as via 3rd party apps. In case any subscriber enters an amount less than Rs. 50 and tries to recharge, an appropriate message would be displayed to him on his screen. Recharge wouldn’t proceed in such cases.""

The direct-to-home (DTH) service provider would join the ranks of D2h and Airtel Digital TV, who also have a minimum recharge amount of Rs 50.

Dish TV, on the other hand, has the lowest recharge requirement at only Rs 10. The DreamDTH report also claimed that Tata Sky subscribers are being informed about the latest revision through SMS messages.

Last, week Tata Sky discontinued the SD set-top box in favour of offering the HD set-top box as the minimum option for a new customer. However, the Tata Sky HD set-top box is currently priced at Rs 1,399, the same price at which the DTH service provider previously sold its SD set-top box."

The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), on January 28, has put Bharti Airtel on its 'Denied Entities List', reported CNBC-TV18.

This, as per the report, was done following the non-fulfillment of export obligations by the telecom company under the Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) scheme.

When a company is listed on the 'Denied Entities List', it leads to the cancellation of its import licence.

However, sources in Bharti Airtel told CNBC-TV18 that no such licence has been sought by the company since April 2018 as it had no operational needs. The sources also said that the company had already applied for the closure of all its past licences that were due, adding that approval from the authorities for the same was being awaited.

The shares of the telecom player hit a record high on January 22 following approval from the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) to raise the foreign direct investment limit in the company to 100 percent, up from the earlier 49 percent.

The approval came a few days before the company has to clear statutory liabilities of up to nearly Rs 35,586 crore, of which Rs 21,682 crore is a licence fee and another Rs 13,904.01 crore is spectrum dues (excluding the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices)."

China Mobile is mulling a foray in India by entering cloud services through a tie-up with either Vodafone Idea or Bharti Airtel, according to a Mint report.

The newspaper said the Chinese state-run telecom major could acquire a significant stake in a joint venture with the Indian telecom firms through a holding company structure.

It added that China Mobile held a meeting with both Indian telecom firms in December 2019 to discuss the possibility.

A holding company structure would give China Mobile board seats and voting rights in the Indian telecom companies even as it would not need to get involved in the day-to-day operations.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report. China Mobile and Bharti Airtel did not respond to Mint’s queries, while Vodafone Idea called it speculation.

An investment in the cloud infrastructure network by China Mobile would not only help Vodafone Idea or Bharti Airtel raise capital to deleverage – both companies have debt of over Rs 1 lakh crore – but also help them scale up for 5G rollout.

Both companies have been struggling since the rollout of Reliance Jio in September 2016, which has adopted an aggressive pricing model and rapidly grabbed market share.

China Mobile is China’s dominant telecom player in a market that has now saturated. Reports say the company is scouting for international opportunities, having created a holding company structure for this purpose."

Reliance Jio has launched voice calling over WiFi services in select circles, according to a report in The Economic Times.

Quoting sources, the report mentioned that the VoWiFi service is currently available only in the national capital.

Jio is expected to not limit its VoWiFi services to the JioFiber network, unlike Airtel, which currently allows VoWiFi feature only on Airtel Xstream Fiber.

Bharti Airtel also rolled out its voice over WiFi services in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) around the second week of December last year. It was made available on 24 smartphones at the time. Later, during the month, the telecom company extended its VoWiFi service to Mumbai, Kolkata, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, following its introduction in Delhi-NCR.

The voice-over calling feature allows customers to switch to any WiFi hotspot or private WiFi network while making outgoing calls.

Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Sunday hiked its mandatory minimum recharge for pre-paid customers to Rs 45 from Rs 23. ""...it will be mandatory to recharge with a voucher of Rs 45 or above, every 28 days to avail services,"" the company said in a public notice.

The new minimum recharge plan will come into effect from Sunday. The announcement pertained to prepaid subscribers of Bharti Airtel and Bharti Hexacom in all service areas, it added.

""In case of non recharge with a voucher of Rs 45 or above at the end of tariff validity period, Airtel reserves the right to provide the plan benefits in a curtailed manner at its own discretion during the grace period of up to 15 days.

""In case of non recharge with voucher of Rs 45 of above, all services will be suspended post the grace period,"" the company said.

Amid a turbulence in the debt laden sector, Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal had recently said a combination of rock-bottom tariffs and high consumption is killing the telecom industry and sector regulator Trai needs to urgently intervene to strike a balance between the needs for protecting investments and consumer interest.

""We are unnecessarily killing this industry in a manner and way that is not conducive for our industry, and that's why we need Trai intervention,"" Mittal had said.

The comments of the Airtel chief had come just days after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) initiated talks to prescribe floor price for call and data, and also deferred by one year the scrapping of the charge paid by mobile phone users for calls made to rival networks.

The two moves came as a big boost to old operators like Airtel and Vodafone Idea that are staring at a liability of thousands of crores in unpaid past statutory dues following a Supreme Court ruling.

Through their association, the operators had been pitching to policy makers for fixing a floor rate for calls and data.

The telecom call and data rates are at present under forbearance or not regulated.

But, Trai has now released a consultation paper to fix minimum or floor rates for mobile phone calls and data -- a move that will effectively end the regime of free calling and dirt cheap data.

The outcome is likely to lead to further hike in mobile call and data cost as the industry wants average revenue per user to reach Rs 300 per month from about Rs 125 at present over a period of two years -- better revenue realisation per user will offer a much-needed breather to the stressed telecom industry where debt levels have soared to Rs 7.8 lakh crore.

Bharti Airtel had posted a staggering Rs 23,045 crore net loss for the second quarter ended September 30, due to provisioning of Rs 28,450 crore in the aftermath of the SC ruling on statutory dues.

According to a government data, statutory liabilities in the case of Bharti Airtel add up to nearly Rs 35,586 crore, of which Rs 21,682 crore is licence fee and another Rs 13,904.01 crore is the SUC (spectrum usage charges) dues (excluding the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices)."

New Mobile Number Portability (MNP) rules will be implemented starting today. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has decided to implement a new set of rules starting today for making the MNP process easier and faster for users.

With the new guidelines, the MNP process will be reduced to 48 hours from its previous cap of eight days. TRAI had laid down these new rules in December 2018, but the implementation was delayed due to a prolonged testing period.

Starting today, a Unique Porting Code (UPC) would be generated for users who request for MNP. The UPC will only be generated if the user is eligible to port-out their mobile number, said TRAI.

The requirements for being eligible for port-out are as follows:





Users with postpaid connections need to clear their ‘outstanding dues’ towards the existing telecom operator for the issued bill as per the cycle.



To apply for MNP, the user must be an active subscriber of the current telecom operator for at least 90 days.



There shouldn’t be any request for a change of ownership of the requested mobile number.



There are no pending contractual obligation(s) to be fulfilled by the subscriber.



The mobile number requested for the port-out is not prohibited by the court of law.



The mobile number sought to be ported is not sub-judice.

If a user meets the new TRAI guidelines for MNP, they can then generate the UCP.

How to generate Unique Porting Code or UPC?

- To generate UCP, the user needs to SMS PORT (space) 10-digit mobile number and send it to 1900.

- The user will then receive an SMS with the code and the UPC. This UPC will now be valid for four days instead of 15 days for all Licensed Service Areas (LSAs), except for Jammu and Kashmir, and North Eastern states where it will be valid for 30 days. MNP requests within the same circle will be executed within three days, whereas for porting in another circle, it will be executed within five days.

Users who wish to cancel their request need to do so within 24 hours after the documents have been submitted. There are no new rules or modifications made in porting for corporate mobile connections."

The company had earlier capped outgoing calls to network of other telecom operator to 1,000 minutes in case of plans with 28 days validity, 3,000 in 84 days validity plans and 12,000 in 365 days validity plan. Beyond this limit, customers were required to pay 6 paise per minute for outgoing calls.

""From tomorrow, enjoy unlimited calling to any network in India with all our unlimited plans. No conditions apply,"" Bharti Airtel said in a tweet on December 6.

The company on December 1 announced new plans under which call and data charges became dearer for its pre-paid customers by up to 50 percent from December 3.

The company had announced new plans in ""unlimited"" category with 2 days, 28 days, 84 days, 365 days validity which on the back of the envelope calculations showed higher price of up to 50 percent

Bharti Airtel increased its entry-level unlimited plan with a year-long validity by about 50 percent to Rs 1,499, with 24 GB of data, in place of Rs 998 plan which comes with 12 GB data usage limit.

The price of 365-days validity plan in the same category with daily data usage limit of 1.5 GB per day now costs 41.2 percent more at Rs 2,398.

The company also announced three new plans - Rs 219 with 28 days validity offering 1 GB per day, Rs 399 and Rs 449 plan with 56 days validity each, offering 1.5 Gb and 2 GB data usage, respectively.

With the removal of limit, Airtel's new 399 plans with 56 days validity becomes cheaper than that of Reliance Jio plan at same price.

The move from both the companies follows Supreme Court judgment on adjusted gross revenue.

Bharti Airtel has posted a staggering Rs 23,045 crore net loss for the second quarter ended September 30, due to provisioning of Rs 28,450 crore in the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling on statutory dues.

According to government data, the liabilities in the case of Bharti Airtel add up to nearly Rs 35,586 crore, of which Rs 21,682 crore is licence fee and another Rs 13,904.01 crore is the SUC dues (excluding the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices).

Airtel and Vodafone Idea have filed separate petitions in the Supreme Court seeking review of the October 24 order of the apex court that held them liable to pay statutory dues for past 14 years after including non-telecom revenue in their annual adjusted gross revenues (AGR). The dues totalling Rs 1.47 lakh crore for the industry are to be paid within three months of the order.

""The liabilities are large at $4.8 billion for Airtel and $5 billion for Vodafone Idea, and if the Supreme Court were to dismiss the review petition causing the entire liabilities to devolve, it would be a negative development for Airtel but even more serious for Vodafone Idea which may find it difficult to fund these liabilities before January 24, 2020,"" Morgan Stanley said in a report.

This, it said, ""could potentially lead to further market share consolidation in the industry thereby strengthening Airtel's positioning in the industry.""

The two firms have been lobbying together with the government for relief on payment of the statutory liabilities.

Bharti Airtel's board has already approved raising $3 billion through a combination of equity ($2 billion) and debt ($1 billion).

""In our view, this fundraise is primarily to take care of the worst-case outcome wherein the entire AGR dues become payable,"" it said. ""However, if part of the AGR liabilities were to be waived and/or were paid over a period of time, then the company could use the proceeds for repayment of existing debt. In either case, we see Airtel's balance sheet strength as a differentiating factor in the industry.""

Goldman Sachs said it hosted Mittal, founder and Chairman of Bharti Enterprises - the holding company of Bharti Airtel, on December 5.

""Mittal shared his thoughts on various aspects of the telecom business, including his outlook on industry structure and tariffs, the potential outcome of AGR liability, and his views on Bharti Airtel's balance sheet and the company's non-wireless subsidiaries, among other things,"" it said.

The meeting, it said, ""reinforces our constructive view on Bharti Airtel, with potential upside risk to estimates from higher-than-expected tariff hike and market share gains from Vodafone Idea,"" it added.

Bharti Airtel expects industry revenues to start growing again due to recent tariff hikes, and expects industry revenues to surpass $50 billion (timeline unspecified) as opposed $30 billion at present, per company.

""In the event of any market share re-allocation in the industry, Bharti Airtel believes it is well-positioned to capture 50 percent or more of the incremental market share; per company, incremental revenues can come at a very high EBITDA margin,"" Goldman Sachs said.

The company saw a low possibility of a new player entering the India telecom market.

Morgan Stanley said the recent tariff hike announcements by all three operators is a step in the right direction towards self-repair.

""While the transmission of these hikes into average revenue per user (ARPU) increases will take some time (as the new tariffs are applicable only on the next recharge and there is a possibility of downgrading to lower value packs), we believe FY 21 ARPUs will nonetheless likely see substantial improvement,"" it said.

It saw a possible ARPU path towards Rs 180-200 over the next few years which is not insurmountable as per user earnings were at Rs 200 in FY15.

""Such large increases will be required for Vodafone Idea along with other government relief measures to bring down its leverage position to more sustainable levels,"" it said.

Before Reliance Jio entered the industry in 2016, Bharti's ARPU was around Rs 200 per month, and the company believes it can get to similar levels over the next few quarters, with levels of close to Rs300/month over time, Goldman Sachs said.

""Return on capital in India telecom remains low, and per the company, ARPUs need to go up for this metric to improve; Bharti believes this is true even for competition. Bharti Airtel believes it can get to 35 percent or more revenue market share over time, from about 32 percent at present,"" it said.

According to the brokerage, Bharti Airtel believes that while its current debt levels are elevated, it remains under control."

The company also noted in the release that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) would likely carry out a consultation process for the revision of telecom tariffs.

The release stated that despite the growth in data consumption and 4G coverage across the country, there are still over 40 crore Indian consumers who have not benefitted from the advent of the latest technologies.

""The ambitious objectives of the ‘Digital India’ mission can be achieved only if India is made '2G-mukt' in the shortest time-frame possible,"" stated the release.

""I want no company to shut operations. I want everyone to be up and running. We want the economy to have good number of companies in business and flourish in their business."" said Sitharaman

""Not just telecom sector, my wish is all companies in all sector(s) be able to do business, service their market customer and survive. So with that approach, the finance ministry has always been talking and in telecom too that's the approach we have taken,"" the minister said in reply to a query regarding stress in the telecom sector.

While announcing its financial results on November 14, telecom major Vodafone Idea (VIL) had said its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on obtaining relief from the government and positive outcome of the legal remedy post the apex court ruling on the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) issue.

The Supreme Court last month ruled in favour of the government and directed telecom companies to pay as much as Rs 1.42 lakh crore in past statutory dues to the government.

Days after the Supreme Court verdict, the government had set up a Committee of Secretaries (CoS) under the Cabinet Secretary to suggest measures to mitigate financial stress in the sector.

Sitharaman said ""it is the intention"" to address concerns of all those who have approached the government with serious concerns post the court's decision.

""We are also conscious that there is a Supreme Court order that the government has won and therefore, the department concerned has to take a call that would be a collective call, taking into account... understanding implication for the sector and finances of the government,"" she said.

Regarding CoS, the minister said ""it is yet to take a call"".

Sitharaman also said that no bank has approached the finance ministry raising concern over their exposure to the telecom sector.

VIL posted a loss of Rs 50,921 crore -- the highest-ever quarterly loss by any corporate in India, mainly on account of provisioning for paying the statutory dues.

The company said it is keeping razor sharp focus on driving greater realisation and Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) but emphasised that tariffs need to move up in long term for industry viability.

The process of switching off the 3G network has already started with Kolkata in the recent-concluded June quarter.

By September, the shut down will be affected in 6-7 more circles and between December and March the entire 3G network would be shut down, Gopal Vittal, CEO (India and South Asia), Bharti Airtel, said during the company's post earnings call.

Badal Bagri, Chief Financial Officer of the company, said that the broader industry which has consolidated to three large players continues to see ""some semblance of stability"".

""While we have witnessed revenue growth despite any outright tariff increase, we continue to believe that prices needs to move up in the long term to ensure industry viability,"" Bagri said.

Airtel said it does not expect prices to move and in fact is prepared for it not to move up despite remaining at ""unsustainable"" level.

To another query on asset monetisation plans for its fibre infrastructure, the company said it continues to evaluate opportunities that come up.

""We had moved all our fibre assets to 100 percent subsidiary and we have all approvals in place right now...that is going to be effected in this current quarter. On monetisation, we will continue to evaluate opportunities and at right time we may choose to see what should be the potential structure,"" Bagri said.

Bharti Airtel on August 1 posted a staggering Rs 2,866 crore loss for the June quarter, its first consolidated loss in 14 years, as the telco ceded ground to rival Reliance Jio and took a hit from exceptional items such as charges towards accelerated depreciation of 3G network gear.

Airtel had logged a net profit of Rs 97 crore in the June quarter of the previous fiscal. The revenue of the Sunil Mittal-led company rose 4.7 per cent to Rs 20,738 crore during the first quarter ended June 2019.

In its latest report on Bharti Airtel's Q1 results, Jefferies said that price hikes in India's mobile business is unlikely in fiscal 2020 and may happen only after Jio becomes the dominant player.

""We believe that price hikes in India's mobile business are unlikely in FY20 and will happen only after Jio becomes the dominant player with 40 percent plus market share, which we expect in FY21,"" Jefferies said in its note."

Indian multinational conglomerate Tata Group has topped a 2019 study called India’s 100 leading brands by UK-based Brand Finance, as per a Business Standard report.

Given the brand's consistent performance on similar charts, Tata beating out competitors comes as no surprise. However, the 37 percent jump in valuation to $19.55 billion, up from last year's $14.23 billion is notable.

This is the first time in seven years that the Group's valuation has crossed the $18 billion mark. Comparisons with previous Brand Finance reports show the brand stayed in the $13-$14 billion range since 2013.

Valued at $7.2 billion, the country's largest insurer, the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) moved up two spaces and grabbed the second spot on the 2019 list.

Information technology major Infosys, valued at $6.5 billion, took the third position. The company registered a 7.7 percent year-on-year growth.

State Bank of India, Mahindra & Mahindra, HDFC Bank, Airtel, HCL, Reliance Industries and Wipro occupied the fourth to tenth spots.

Notably, Airtel saw it's brand valuation drop by 28 percent, while all others on the top 10 list grew between 1.7 percent and 35.5 percent.

Among the top 12, three names are from the banking sector, namely SBI, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. In fact, as many as 14 banks feature on the full top 100 list.

This was a surprise at a time when the domestic banking market is grappling with challenges on various fronts.

Airtel Africa, a unit of India's Bharti Airtel Ltd, last week set a price range of 80 to 100 pence per share for its IPO, which is expected to raise 595 million pounds from the issuance of 595.2 million to 744 million new shares."

The 'registration document' outlines the general details about the company and post its approval by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the company also has to file a separate draft prospectus to the FCA for approval.

It is the prospectus which will contain details of the public offer including the number of shares, and issue price.

""Airtel Africa Ltd announces that a registration document relating to the company has received approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority...,"" Airtel Africa said on its website.

Telecom czar Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel's Africa unit plans to launch over $1 billion (around Rs 6,970 crore) IPO in London to help reduce debt. The company is eyeing a June listing.

While the company has not divulged the amount it intends to raise from the proposed public offer, banking sources said it expects to raise over $1 billion.

The firm plans to sell 25 per cent of new shares of Airtel Africa in the proposed initial public offering (IPO) and is looking to trade on the main market of the London Stock Exchange using its premium listing segment, Bharti Airtel had said in a regulatory filing on May 28.

It is also considering a listing in Nigeria, the firm had added.

Airtel Africa, last year, raised $1.25 billion from six investors including Temasek Holdings Pte, SoftBank Group Corp and Warburg Pincus, giving it an equity value of about $4.4 billion."

The operator has also revised the total number of plans being offered to post-paid customers.

After revising the fares, Airtel’s entry-level post-paid plan starts at Rs 499. The company has made this move in order to improve its ARPU and boost profit margins. Out of the total 284 million subscribers, less than 7 per cent of users have subscribed to the Rs 499 plan but generate around 20- 25 per cent of the total revenue. Post the updated tariff, Airtel users with Rs 299 and Rs 349 plans would have to subscribe to Rs 499 plan. The company, in the process, might lose some of its customers as competitors like Jio, Vodafone- Idea have not revised their post-paid plans yet.

Another reason for Airtel to scrap its entry-level plans was to minimise cost, as per Bharat Bhargava, partner, telecom advisory services, EY India. “Everything comes at a cost, and if you want to give better customer experience, you need to cover those costs”, Bhargava told ET Telecom. He further added that telcos analyse and revise their offerings based on the costs involved in carrying every product. The revision helps in offering better experience at an acceptable price point, both for customers and telcos.

Apart from the Rs 299 and Rs 349 plans, Airtel has also dropped high-value packs like Rs 649, Rs 1,199 and Rs 2,999. The country’s second largest telecom operator now offers only four post-paid plans for its users including the Rs 499 monthly plan which offers 75GB data with unlimited calls, as per the MyAirtel app. The other three plans would cost Rs 749, Rs 999 and Rs 1,599, and offer 125GB, 150GB and conditional unlimited data respectively. The post-paid plans also come with Netflix and Amazon Prime subscriptions along with Wynk Music, Airtel Music, and VIP customer service.

Airtel has been facing a reduction in its profit margins since the entry of Reliance Jio. The telecom operator has since then been making several attempts in order to increase its ARPU, even at the cost of losing some customers. The company recently scrapped its minimum recharge plans for prepaid users as well.

Airtel’s competitor Jio is currently offering only one post-paid plan worth Rs 199 that offers Rs 25GB data. Vodafone, on the other hand, offers multiple plans starting at Rs 399 with 40GB monthly data."

Highlights:

- Overall industry witnessed net additions in subscribers

- Reliance Jio added the highest number of customers in the month among all players

- Vodafone-Idea has lost customers for eight months on a trot --------------------------------------------------

As per latest subscriber addition numbers reported by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), Reliance Jio continues to trouble other key players. Jio continues to add subscribers on the back of aggressive pricing while others struggle to add and maintain their market share.

What does the latest TRAI data suggests?TRAI recently published subscriber data for December 2018. Overall, the industry continues to grow and witnessed an addition of 4.5 million new customers, taking its total subscriber base to 1.176 billion.

Jio – reducing the gap with leadersJio continues to maintain its momentum and added 8.6 million subscribers in December, the highest number of subscribers added in the month among all. Jio currently has an active subscriber base of 280 million. On the back of its competitive pricing strategy, it continues to gain market share and is reducing the gap with incumbents. Its market share reached 23.8 percent in December, up from 23.2 percent last month.

Bharti Airtel – lost again!Bharti Airtel reversed the trend of last two months and lost 1.5 million subscribers, taking its subscriber base to 340 million as at December-end. Further, it saw a 23 basis points (100 bps=1 percentage point) loss in market share month-on-month at 28.9 percent.

Vodafone–Idea: Struggle continuesThe company that is struggling the most is Vodafone-Idea, which has been continuously losing market share. It has seen its subscriber base fall by 29 million over the last eight months and market share shrink by 656 bps. The company lost 2.3 million customers in December 2018, taking its subscriber base to 419 million at the end of the month.

What to expect going forward?We see no signs of rising average revenue per user (ARPUs) as Jio continues to aggressively add customers on the back of its Jio Phone and post-paid customers. As Jio has not been slashing tariffs further, we expect stability in ARPUs going forward. But the competition is not expected to ebb in the near term and hence we advise investors to tread cautiously in the sector.

Telecom regulator Trai has served a showcause notice to Airtel over the blackout faced by some of its DTH customers during the switchover to the new tariff regime, sources said. The showcause notice was issued by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) earlier this week, and Airtel has been given three days time to respond, they told PTI.

When contacted, an Airtel spokesperson said a few customers may have experienced delays in provisioning of channels, owing to a massive surge in last minute requests during migration, and that the service provider remains committed to ensuring compliance with all regulatory norms.

Trai has unveiled the new tariff order and regulatory regime for the broadcast and cable sector, which would pave the way for consumers to opt for channels they wish to view, and pay only for them.

It had said every channel should be offered a la carte, with a transparent display of rates on electronic programme guide.

The new framework came into effect from February 1.

In a statement Wednesday, Trai said it had ""received information that while migrating consumers, one large service provider has caused blackout on the TV screen of a few thousand subscribers"".

Taking a serious view, the regulator has issued showcause notice to that service provider, Trai statement said but neither identified the player, nor divulged any details.

A Trai official however confirmed that the operator in reference is Airtel and that in the said instance, certain customers who had made channel selection under the new framework, had faced disruption during the migration process and could only view the last channel they had chosen.

""So, Trai issued showcause notice on why adequate measures were not taken, despite the regulator insisting that consumers should not face any inconvenience,"" the Trai official said.

Responding to an e-mailed query, an Airtel spokesperson said, ""customer experience is of paramount importance to us. We have over 15 million customers who are being migrated to the new tariff regime. Due to massive surge in last minute requests, particularly on January 31 and February 1, few customers may have experienced some delays in provisioning of channels"".

""We remain fully committed to ensuring compliance with all Trai guidelines and will file our response to the notice,"" the Airtel spokesperson added.

Airtel's DTH offerings had 15 million customers at the end of the December quarter, an increase of 7.6 per cent over the corresponding quarter last year."

India's largest telecom operator by users Vodafone Idea plans to increase minimum recharge tariffs to mend its profitability and aims to achieve its synergy target of Rs 14,000 crore by 2020-21, two years before the original target, reported Mint.

The company is preparing to take on Bharti Airtel and Reliance Industries-owned Reliance Jio by expanding its 4G network mobile tower sites. It is also planning to divide its market into four categories and adopt a specific strategy for each of them, sources told the paper.

The management of the loss-making Vodafone Idea, which was formed after Idea Cellular and Vodafone India merged in August, reportedly held a meeting with telecom analysts on November 21 to discuss its revival plans and strategy.

A person present at the meeting told the paper that the management believes a tariff hike is imminent and that it will be significant one, given the company's negative free-cash situation.

Vodafone Idea currently 4G coverage in 50 percent of the areas it serves. It hopes to push this to 70 percent in the next six months, and to 80 percent in 2019-20, the person was quoted as saying.

The telecom giant is currently awaiting full realisation of merger synergies, as the integration of spectrum assets and networks of both Vodafone and Idea is underway.

The merger of Idea Cellular and Vodafone was triggered by fierce competition in the telecom sector after the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016.

Vodafone Idea announced its first quarterly results in September, reporting a loss of Rs 4,970 crore. The company's average revenue per user (ARPU) came in at Rs 88, much lower than Airtel's Rs 101 and Jio's Rs 131.70.

Last month, Airtel said it had simplified 7-8 of its tariffs, with minimum recharge plans starting at Rs 35. The aim was to reduce the number of marginal customers it had, control expenses and provide better services to its users.

The board of Vodafone Idea has set up a committee of directors to explore avenues to raise up to Rs 25,000 crore of capital. The committee will also look into a potential sale of the company's fibre network, which has over 156,000 km of intra-city and inter-city fibre routes.

The company has acknowledged a liquidity crunch in the telecom sector and has sought the government's help to meet its financial obligations, a government official said.

Bharti Airtel’s India CEO Gopal Vittal urged employees to take efforts to gain revenue market share (RMS) in the next two years, saying factors such as network expansion, content collaborations and a lean organisation are already in place.

In a letter to employees, Vittal said the entire telecom industry has sailed through some difficult times, but acknowledged the opportunity to serve 1.3 billion customers in India, along with competitors including Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio Infocomm.

He pressed on the importance of privacy and data protection for Airtel’s 345 million customers, according to an Economic Times report.

The newly merged entity Vodafone Idea knocked Bharti Airtel off its no 1 perch with respect to RMS last week, although the latter is only short of 50 basis points from Vodafone Idea’s 32.2 percent.

Jio’s entry in the telecom space in September 2016 triggered a price war leading to the merger of Vodafone and Idea. Joining Idea and Vodafone India, Airtel India reported losses for the last two quarters.

Vittal highlighted that the Rs 50,000 crore of industry revenue and Rs 1 lakh crore of assets had to be written off due to the tariff war that followed, resulting in 'hundreds of thousands of jobs lost and a merger of the number two and three player'. He also cited positives like customers are speaking 1.5 times more and using 9 times more data than earlier.

Despite the disruptive activities in the market, he said Airtel continues to grow and must do the same in the future. “Our annual capex has grown from a high of Rs 16,000 crore to Rs 24,000 crore, largely covered by our operational cash flows. Our balance sheet will remain solid.”

He stated that Airtel will focus on growing its market share in the next two years and the uncertainty and flux in the industry will be of help to the company.

The new rate will be effective September 1, the payments bank informed its customers today via a text message. A company spokesperson confirmed the step.

The 150-basis point cut in interest rate is the second time Airtel Payments Bank has undertaken such an exercise this year. It had reduced the interest rate by 175 bps in February. 1 bps is one hundredth of a percentage point.

So far, Airtel Payments Bank was offering the highest rate in its segment but with 4 percent rate from next month, its rate will be at par with that of other banks like Paytm Payments Bank.

One doesn’t have to keep any minimum balance or pay any charges for opening an account with a payments bank. An account holder cannot have a balance of more than Rs 1,00,000 with a payments bank.

Airtel Payments Bank is a subsidiary of Bharti Airtel, India’s second largest mobile services providers by number of subscribers. Kotak Mahindra Bank also has a stake in the bank.

A Payments Bank is a differentiated bank that provides essential financial services to its customers. It’s an online bank with no branches. Anybody with a mobile number can open an account with a payments bank.

Bharti Airtel is the first entity to have got a licence from Reserve Bank of India for launching a payments bank.

In December 2017, Airtel Payments Bank was accused of opening accounts for customers without their consent using Aadhar e-Know Your Client-based details. This led the Unique Identification Authority of India to temporarily suspend e-KYC licenses of Bharti Airtel and Airtel Payments Bank.

The ‘gift’ is valid for eligible subscribers of select Airtel Postpaid and V-Fiber Home Broadband plans. On expiry of the free period, subscribers can pay for an extension using the Airtel postpaid or home broadband bill.

In a statement, Airtel said it will be announcing details of the eligible postpaid mobile and home broadband plans in the coming weeks.

Apart from a free subscription, the partnership pertains to Airtel promoting Netflix content by providing a dedicated row on the Airtel TV app to access Netflix.

""Partnerships are at the core of Airtel's DNA and we are delighted to expand our strategic relationship with Netflix.

Profits of the top three incumbent telecom firms Airtel, Idea and Vodafone have halved in the past three years with a 1,000 bps plunge in operating margins, and a recovery is seen only from FY20 when consolidation in the industry is complete, warns a report.

The corrosive effect of the competition, which began after Reliance Jio entered the fray in September 2016, will see gross revenue of the top three incumbents plunging by 14-16 percent this financial year as they are forced to focus on retaining subscriber base, Crisil said in a report today.

Nonetheless, the industry is expected to see a 45 percent growth in data volume, 3 percent in subscribers, but a 18-20 percent plunge in average revenue per user (Arpu) in FY19, it added.

Industry revenue will continue to skid in FY19 as realisation will continue to head south.

""The battle unleashed by Jio has seen the industry's gross revenue and adjusted gross revenue or AGR plummeting 10 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, in fiscal 2018, while their profit have halved in the past three years and the situation is expected to improve only after fiscal 2020, following completion of consolidation the merger of Idea with Vodafone,"" it warned.

Profitability is unlikely to improve this fiscal year too as margin is expected to contract further by 150-200 bps owing to the full year impact of the IUC cut. Top three incumbents will see a sharper deterioration, said the report.

""Consolidated margin of the top three incumbents is expected to shrink by 250-300 bps due to increase in network operation cost and fall in Arpu as competition is no longer limited to prepaid, but entered the postpaid space too.

""Between fiscals 2016 and 2019, operating profit of the top three incumbents is likely to halve following a drop of 10 percentage drop in operating margins,"" said the report.

Airtel's operating margin has deteriorated the worst with a 1,100 bps drop in the past seven quarters.

On top of it all, the incumbents will have to cough up Rs 75,000 crore on network capex this fiscal and the only breathing space they have is the relief in regulatory capex thanks to the increase in deferred payment period to 16 years from 10 and will be at Rs 16,500 crore this year.

The industry-wide debt is at Rs 3.5-3.7 trillion in fiscal 2018, of which over 50 per cent is with Airtel, Vodafone and Idea alone. The debt pile is expected to remain high in fiscal 2019 as cash headroom continues to drop as cash flow from operations of the top three incumbents is expected to shrink 3-5 per cent this fiscal, the report said.

These three have already announced plans to raise Rs 65,000 crore via bonds, debentures and loans in addition to them planning over Rs 16,500 crore through stake sale.

The only bright spots are low data tariffs and rising digital content consumption. In FY18 alone, data traffic grew four fold. Availability of cheap 4G enabled devices along with all-time low data tariffs are driving the shift in subscriber mix towards 4G. In all likelihood data traffic in fiscal 2019 will increase 45 percent despite a high base.

But what is more critical is that data realisation plummeted 95 per cent during the same period, leading to dual SIM declines, with smaller players shutting shop.

The intense price war began in September 2016 when Jio entered the market with almost free data and fully free voice which it ran for months, forcing others to follow suit and shows no signs of abating even after two years.

""If anything, competition has become even more brutal, and the pain is expected to continue this fiscal as well. Consequently, average gross revenue may decline another 6-8 percent this fiscal as deterioration in realisation from data sales will continue.

But data volume growth, expected at 45 percent which is fivefold jump from fiscal 2018, will limit the damage,"" said the report.

The industry-wide realisation has been declining due to continued downward revision in tariffs more for the high end data users. As a result, average realisation per MB plummeted from 23 paise in fiscal 2016 to a mere 1.6 paise in fiscal 2018, it added.

""We see average realisation per MB falling further to 1.15-1.20 paise by this fiscal end because of the data pricing war led by Jio, which has been a net gainer following a cut in interconnect usage charges,"" warned the report."
"August 08, 2018 02:30 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/policy/exclusive-trai-to-seek-views-on-shift-to-internet-networks-to-phase-out-legacy-systems-2818941.html,"SEO Training

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India is set to seek views of stakeholders on making telecom companies switch over to a completely Internet-based network, according to a senior official. Additionally, this would mean phasing out the legacy TDM (time division multiplexing) networks.

The term of the current Chairman RS Sharma comes to an end Thursday and hence the consultation paper is likely to be issued either today or tomorrow.

“We are asking if there should be a sunset clause for TDM networks or we could even leave it to the industry to retire the legacy networks over time. But overall, the authority is in favour of moving to Internet-based networks,” the official said.

It may be mentioned here that the proposed IP-based network is not to be confused with Internet telephony which is a different technology altogether. Internet telephony does not operate on spectrum unlike IP-based system which still needs those frequencies. Internet telephony is public system whereas IP-based communication is within the network of the operator.

TDM is a method of putting multiple data streams in a single signal by separating the signal into many parts, each having a short duration. Each signal appears on the line only a fraction of time in an alternating pattern and is reassembled at the receiving end based on the timing.

In a TDM network, voice is carried as a wave and is prone to disturbance.

An official with a telecom company said inclusion of a sunset clause would be unfair to mobile companies as they have invested billions of rupees in the existing legacy systems and it makes no sense to give up on them for no apparent great reason. TRAI should not be telling companies the choice of systems and networks they should adopt, he said.

Internet-based networks are the latest in technology where voice, like data, travels in a packet and is not prone to breakdowns.

IP-based networks use spectrum far more efficiently compared to a TDM network as a packet (particularly a voice packet) needs very little bandwidth for transmission. IP-based systems require less maintenance and hence fewer people to manage, thus leading to cost reduction for telecom companies.

Reliance Jio Infocomm is the only Indian mobile company that has an all IP-based network. Others are still in the process of laying IP networks and may take years to completely switch over to it.

However, the remuneration of Bharti Airtel Managing Director and CEO Gopal Vittal increased by around 37 percent to Rs 16.97 crore on account of increase in salary and stocks option, according to the company's report.

Mittal's total remuneration from Airtel was Rs 30.14 crore and Vittal was paid Rs 12.4 crore in 2016-17.

Bharti Airtel granted average increase of 7.1 percent in the remuneration of employees excluding key managerial (KMP) during 2017-18 and the average increase in the remuneration of KMPs was 14.84 percent.

During the year 2017-18, Airtel permanent workforce reduced by around 800 to 8,453 from 9,279 in 2016-17.

""The telecom industry faced an extraordinarily turbulent year in India through unprecedented disruption,"" Mittal said in the report.

He said that extreme pricing pressure accelerated market exits and industry consolidation, which evolved towards a 3 plus 1 structure which is three private telecom operators and one public sector firm.

""Even though the transition is turning out to be stressful entailing massive dislocation in the short run, the new industry structure will ultimately prove beneficial for the sector,"" Mittal said.

While total customer base of the company continued to rise every year to reach the highest ever level of 413 million at the end of 2017-18, the consolidated revenue of the company was the lowest in last four fiscal years at Rs 83,688 crore at the end of March 2018.

Mittal said strategy of Airtel is to grow share of high average revenue per user (ARPU) customers and improving customer stickiness by offering new products.

""Aggressive network rollout continued to be an overriding priority for us as a record 110,000 mobile sites were rolled out during the year to strengthen our 4G footprint,"" he said.

He said it was gratifying to see the way Airtel held itself as pressure mounted on the top-line of mobility business.

Vittal said to grow share of high ARPU customers, Airtel focussed on grabbing increased share of 4G devices through alliances and simplified pricing, driving data consumption through intense focus on SIM consolidation led by bundled pricing plans and increasing postpaid connection adoption."

Telecom major Bharti Airtel today said it has appointed Ajay Chitkara as director and CEO of its business-to-business arm - Airtel Business. The company also moved Bharti Infratel chief financial officer Pankaj Miglani as CEO of Global Business.

""Ajay Chitkara has been appointed as Director and CEO - Airtel Business. In his new role, Ajay will spearhead Airtel Business as an integrated unit that will include both domestic enterprise and global enterprise operations of the company,"" Airtel said in a statement.

Chitkara has been with Airtel since 2001 and is credited with building brand Airtel in the global wholesale segment.

""In his previous role as Director & CEO - Global Business and Nxtra, Ajay was responsible for creating business strategies for carriers, global enterprise and OTT segments, and implementing them globally through the regional teams,"" the statement said.

The company said that Global Business arm of Airtel grew in topline to become a billion dollar business, while cash flow margins jumped five-fold since 2013 under Chitkara.

In his new position, he will continue reporting to Gopal Vittal, MD and CEO – Bharti Airtel.

Airtel said that Miglani, who played a key role in the Bharti Infratel's IPO in 2012, will report to Chitkara.

Miglani has worked in Airtel for 10 years in various roles, including chief controller of enterprise business and business head for global voice services."

International rating agency Fitch today retained its ratings on Bharti Airtel at BBB- along with a stable outlook, citing the unlikelihood of a further drop in tariffs coupled with its rising non-telecom revenue streams.

The agency has a BBB- ratings on Bharti's long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating along with a BBB- ratings on the bonds issued by its subsidiary Bharti Airtel International Netherlands.

It said the rating reflects Bharti's diversified and integrated business profile, with operations spanning mobile, fixed-line, digital TV, telecom tower and enterprise sectors in the home market along with mobile operations in Sri Lanka and 14 African markets.

""Bharti will increase its home market mobile revenue market share to 35-36 percent, on completion of its acquisition of Tata Tele, despite high competitive intensity,"" Fitch said.

The agency, however, was quick to add that ""any further increase in competitive intensity could weigh on its ratings, as it has low rating headroom.""

It can be noted that once the merger of Vodafone and Idea happens, Bharti will be pushed to the No 2 slot both in terms of revenue and number of subscribers.

""The stable outlook reflects our belief that revenue from Bharti's home market mobile segment may recover on higher data volume and its African and enterprise business segments will continue to expand.

""We believe telecom tariff levels in the country are unsustainable in the medium-to long-term in light of the low return on investment for telcos,"" Fitch said.

On the solid revenue stream of the company, the report noted that the operating revenue contribution from its African and non-mobile businesses in the home market has steadily increased to 22 percent and 28 percent, respectively, in FY18, from 15 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in FY17.

But it was soon to add that already highly leveraged Bharti has not only has a lower rating headroom but also it will decline further with a leverage of 2.1-2.3x in FY19 from 2x, excluding USD 6.5 billion deferred spectrum costs in FY18.

Fitch has forecast that both revenues as well as operating profit will remain flat on sustained competition, and ruled out any tariff hikes on the aggressive play by Reliance Jio which will remain aggressively competitive and will prevent any meaningful rise in industry tariffs.

Given this, Bharti's revenue is likely to increase by 1-2 per cent in FY19, driven by a growth in digital TV, tower and enterprise business segments, the agency said.

The operating margin will remain stable at 34-35 percent, down 100 bps from FY18 as there is no incremental competition in the mobile segment, it added."

In recent days, careless social media handling has put many bigwigs of the Indian corporate industry in a tight spot. Airtel on Monday, by their own admission, inadvertently, acceded to the demands of a customer who sought a Hindu representative instead of a Muslim which was ridiculed by a vast majority of people on social media.

It seems, before Airtel erred, HDFC Bank had also mishandled a customer on Twitter. A customer who asked the bank about its policy of making Aadhaar mandatory for opening bank accounts, the company apparently instructed its executive to “do not engage the customer further” and assign if “ranting” continues.

The bank, however, deleted the tweet and apologised later. The bank admitted that the earlier tweet was “inappropriate and inadvertent.”

Bharat Varma, who goes by the Twitter handle @BharatVarma3, in a tweet on June 15, demanded clarification from the bank:

Simple query. Need to open a new savings account. Willing to submit all documents offline. Your website does NOT say Aadhaar is mandatory. It's mentioned as just one ID proof. IS AADHAAR MANDATORY?

HDFC Bank apparently replied, “Hi Bharat, yes, as per our Bank’s internal guidelines, Aadhaar Card or Aadhaar enrolment number is required at the time of opening a account. (Sic)”

In the same tweet by the bank, signed by someone named Anay, an instruction to the 'NS team' was passed, “Post response and do not engage customer further. If ranting, assign.”

The tweet was later deleted, and only a screenshot was posted by Bharat Varma later. Moneycontrol has not seen the tweet.

HDFC Bank, in the same thread, posted another response, “A tweet posted in response to a customer's query earlier was inappropriate and inadvertent. It's a human error which shouldn't have happened. This doesn't reflect the Bank's commitment towards excellent service. We are extremely sorry and sincerely regret this error.”

As per Reserve Bank of India’s rules on KYC, Aadhaar is key to open a full-fledged bank account. However, even without Aadhaar, banks can open a ‘small account’ which have severe restrictions on transactions and are closely monitored to ensure no foreign transactions take place.

Moreover, any change in norms, however, was subject to a final decision by the Supreme Court on matters related to Aadhaar, the banking regulator had clarified. The changes made in circular were not supposed to have an immediate impact.

The hearing on the validity of Aadhaar and its use for linking to various financial schemes and banks has been completed and the judgment is awaited in the Supreme Court."

The DoT has sought reply within a week from Airtel on a complaint by rival Reliance Jio alleging that the operator flouted norms on activation of eSIM in Apple Watch 3, an official source said.

The Department of Telecom also mentioned that the security clearance tests for the service are due on May 23 and May 30, 2018.

The DoT on May 17 has sought multiple clarification within a week from Airtel about eSIM service facilitation by the company on Apple Watch 3.

Both, Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel are selling Apple Watch Series 3 since May 11 through their sales channels.

""Jio has filed complaint alleging that Airtel has not set-up the eSIM provisioning node within India in ""gross violation to the licence terms. Airtel had informed DoT about the service but in its letter services storing user information was not indicated. The department has asked Airtel whether e-sim provisioning network of node of Airtel is storing eSIM profiles and user information outside India,"" the source told PTI.

Apple Watch 3 and iPhone of a subscriber share the same number and subscribers can use both iPhone and Apple Watch with eSIM to make or receive calls independent of the call status of the other devices.

The eSIM is paired with the SIM in iPhone wirelessly through a dedicated network node. The node used for eSIM profile allocation contains network and user information such as operator identifier, SIM details, PIN, remote file management for managing SIM files remotely etc.

""The DoT has received information that Airtel intends to launch Apple Watch 3 service. The tests for security clearance of the service is scheduled for May 23 and May 30, 2018. This was informed to Airtel on May 11,"" the source said.

When contacted Airtel spokesperson said that the company has already written to the DoT on May 15, 2018 and clarified that it is in compliance with the licence conditions and why ""Reliance's complaint is fallacious and needs to be rejected"".

""It appears that this particular communication from the DoT (which is dated May 17, 2018) has not taken into account our communication. We would like to reiterate that this is yet another frivolous complaint by Reliance and we will respond to it at the appropriate forums,"" the spokesperson said.

Airtel in its letter dated May 15 to DoT said that all information relating to customers, network nodes etc, along with provision for lawful interception, are hosted in a fully secure manner by the company in India.

It stated that no network node or information or data, as alleged by Reliance Jio, has been hosted outside of India.

Airtel's letter said that network node referred by Reliance Jio appears to be an inventory server, called SMDP server of eSIM, which is not the network node of the company.

The letter said that network related information on SIM or eSIM to enable mobile devices connect with network is loaded by SIM makers outside India.

Airtel said that Reliance Jio itself is using SMDP servers installed outside India, which it has not diclosed to the DoT.

A company official on condition of anonymity said that charges levelled by the rival are baseless and the SMDP server used by Jio is located inside India.

The Department of Telecom on May 14 approved the merger -- a move that will make the subscriber base of Sunil Mittal-led firm almost twice the size of new entrant Reliance Jio. Both the companies had entered into an agreement for the deal in February 2017.

A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar while passing the order also questioned the maintainability of the suit filed by Reliance JIO (RJIO) which alleged that Airtel's advertisement was ""deceptive and misleading"".

""Prima facie we have strong reservations about the maintainability of the plea,"" the court said while setting aside the second interim order passed by the single judge on May 2.

The single judge in his May 2 order had asked Airtel to use font of 12 pixels in print media and that too in a prominent and visible place and not at the bottom.

The high court, however, allowed the first interim order of April 13 to continue to operate.

In the April 13 order, the single judge had asked Airtel to carry a disclaimer in bold stating that under its 'live and free access offer' only subscription to video streaming platform Hotstar would be free and data charges according to the subscriber's plan would apply.

During the arguments, senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Dayan Krishnan, appearing for RJIO, said that both orders were passed with the consent of the two sides and thus, an appeal could not have been moved against the same.

Senior advocate P Chidambaram, appearing for Airtel, contended that while his client was agreeable to carrying a disclaimer of font size 12 pixels instead of the earlier 10 pixels, it was not in agreement with the additional directions that the same has to be carried in a ""prominent and visible place"".

The May 2 order had said, ""So far as the video clips/television advertisements are concerned the disclaimer should start running from the word the girl says 'Seasonal Pass-------------' and it should be displayed in sync with the voice over. The disclaimer in bill boards and hoardings be also at prominent place.""

During the hearing of the appeal by Airtel, the bench said it has ""grave doubts"" about maintainability of the suit by the RJIO.

The RJIO, in its suit, had claimed that the advertisements ""falsely proclaim"" that Airtel was offering ""live and free"" access to T20 cricket coverage and also ""falsely represent that a subscriber need only obtain a 4G sim from the defendant company and download the Airtel TV app to obtain a virtual season pass, that is live and free access to T20 coverage"".

The telecom department today assured that the Airtel-Telenor deal will be approved in less than a month and asserted that clearances related to the mega merger of Vodafone and Idea Cellular too are being expedited.

Telecom Secretary Aruna Sundararajan said she did not foresee any hurdles in the clearances pertaining to the Vodafone-Idea merger (a move that would create India's largest telecom operator dislodging Bharti Airtel from the top slot) and that it ""should get done"" in the timeframe of June outlined by the two companies.

Yesterday, the Supreme Court had dismissed the Department of Telecom (DoT) plea that challenged telecom tribunal order directing it to clear Airtel's takeover of Telenor India, without insisting on bank guarantee of about Rs 1,500 crore as a pre-requisite. The move is widely perceived to have positive implications for a takeover deals in the rapidly consolidating telecom market in India.

""Very shortly. (It will take) normal processing time and it will be done,"" Sundararajan said responding to a question on when the approvals from the DoT can be expected in Bharti-Telenor deal. She said the approval will come ""must faster"" than a month.

On whether the same applicability (bank guarantee) should also be expected for Vodafone-Idea merger, the telecom secretary declined to make a specific comment, merely saying that each case will have to be seen separately.

""The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) and the ministry are working closely to ensure we don't create any bottlenecks and we go through the due diligence and expedite the clearances....at the same time, we are working with the company to ensure there are no delays from our side,"" she said on the sidelines of CII Broadband Summit here.

Last month, during its results announcement, Idea Cellular had said that merger of Idea and Vodafone India is in the final leg of regulatory approvals and expected to be completed by June.

Sundararajan today said that she does not anticipate any issues and that it ""should get done in that timeframe"".

Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu has told PTI in an interview earlier this month that the telecom ministry is the competent authority to take the final call on Idea Cellular's proposal for infusing 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in the company. It was communicated to the DoT that it is the competent authority to deal with the proposal, Prabhu had said.

The FDI policy allows an overseas firm to buy up to 49 per cent stake in an Indian telecom company under automatic approval route. But the government nod is required for stake above 49 per cent.

Idea and Vodafone announced last year that they would combine their operations to create the country's largest telecom operator worth over USD 23 billion, with a 35 per cent market share.

Foreign shareholding in Idea as on March 31, 2018 stood at around 34 per cent, including 7.49 per cent in promoter group and the rest as public shareholders.

British telecom multinational Vodafone Group plc is a majority shareholder in Vodafone India. Foreign shareholding in the combined Idea-Vodafone entity, therefore, would breach the automatic approval limit of 49 per cent.

According to the Idea-Voda merger announcement, Vodafone would own 45.1 per cent of the combined company after transferring a 4.9 per cent stake to Aditya Birla Group for Rs 3,900 crore in cash, concurrent with completion of the merger."

"May 06, 2018 01:02 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/podcast-telecom-wars-a-new-hope-for-airtel-in-africa-2563469.html,"A not so long, long time ago, in a country all around us, Airtel and Vodafone were almost undisputed leaders of the telecom market.

Enter a juggernaut called Reliance Jio, and with it, tremors in the apple cart. Vodafone and Idea are about to form an alliance; Jio continues to roll on grabbing with it Saavn and as many ears and eyeballs as it can along the way in its aggressive bid to close the gap with its rivals; and Airtel remains the market leader – for now – and according to an Economic Times survey, still the most admired company in India in the telecom space.

Airtel is now also training its eyes on a territory that has suddenly become profitable – Africa. With the players placed the way they are and the race for telecom supremacy ever intensifying, we start a new series a day after Star Wars Day, May the 4th. This is Telecom Wars – Episode One, A New Hope for Airtel in Africa.

Reports emerged today that Bharti Airtel plans to raise as much as $1.5 billion by diluting about 25% of its stake when it lists the holding company for Africa operations, Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) BV, or BAIN BV, in early 2019 on the London Stock Exchange.

At its upper end, it would also mean that the holding company will be valued at about $6 billion. The money obtained through dilution will help bolster Airtel’s efforts to stay competitive in the Indian market, where Bharti has just declared its first-ever quarterly loss.

Net loss, before exceptional items, for the India business in the three months ended March 31, 2018, stood at Rs 652.30 crore, compared with a net profit of Rs 770.80 crore a year earlier, the Sunil Mittal-led telco said in a statement on Tuesday. This is in contrast with the profits it is seeing in Africa now – just this quarter alone, the Africa operations posted a profit of 698.7 crores, sparing the company some blushes. Ironically enough, when Airtel started its Africa operations, it was widely considered a poor move. In response to a question on the one business decision that he regrets the most, Sunil Mittal himself said Africa may have been a poor decision. “We all must have made lots of mistakes. Lots of decision when I look back, I wish they were better thought through. If you pin me down to one, I would say in 2010 our decision to go to Africa was a bit rushed and that has taken 6-7-8 years and lot of resources and my personal time to fix that.” Look how things have changed in 2018. Like the saying goes, there is always money in the banana stand. And well, as it turns out, in Africa.

WHAT AFRICA BRINGS TO THE BHARTI TABLE NOW

Bharti Airtel’s consolidated revenue dropped 10.5% on year to Rs 19,634 crore primarily as data and voice tariffs in India fell further. Revenue from India operations — which make up almost 77% of the total — declined 13% year on year to Rs 14,795.50 crore, dragged by lower revenue from mobile services which fell 20% on year. For the full financial year, 2017-18, Airtel’s consolidated net profit declined 71% on year to Rs 1,099 crore and consolidated revenue fell over 12% to Rs 83,688 crore. Africa revenues account for 25.13% of Airtel’s consolidated revenues and the company attributed this to strong data growth and Airtel Money transactions.

That was all number-heavy stats, but the subtext is that Airtel is reading the writing on the wall here in India, and it reads J, I, O. The tariff wars are showing no signs of a ceasefire with reports of Jio planning to further slash prices. Africa operations, projected to be healthy in the near future, have therefore assumed an unexpectedly important role in Airtel’s coffers now. The listing on the LSE could also help Bharti Airtel deleverage its balance sheet, analysts have observed. Useful considering overall debt was Rs 95,000 crore at the end of March!

A November 2017 report from investment banking company CLSA says that for the next three years, Africa revenues will grow by 3% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) led by lower access charges – which is a fee paid by a subscriber to a carrier to get on their network – and tight cost controls. Africa’s balance sheet was helped by Airtel selling assets worth $3.25 billion over the past three years. Airtel sold 10,540 towers and sold its Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone operations.

AIRTEL’S STRATEGY IN AFRICA

Airtel’s strategy in Africa has been one of establishing a presence (paved by its acquisition of Zain) and also making local friends. Over the past few years, it has been trying to capture the African market through local deals. It has made three small-ticket acquisitions in Uganda, Congo Brazzaville and Kenya. Livement reported that, in October, Airtel signed a deal with Millicom, which operates the brand Tigo, to combine their operations in Ghana. After this deal, in December, Airtel’s subsidiary in Rwanda announced the acquisition of Tigo Rwanda Ltd, making Airtel the second largest telecom firm in that country.

“Airtel has taken proactive steps in Africa to consolidate and realign the market structure in the last few remaining countries where its operations are lagging on account of lower market share and presence of too many operators,” Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said in a statement on 19 December. “We are also committed to the long-term viability of our operations in Kenya and Tanzania, to ensure that in 2018, all our 15 operations in Africa start contributing positive margins and cash flows towards a healthy and profitable Airtel Africa,” Mittal had said back then.

WHY IS AIRTEL STRUGGLING AT THE TELECOM WARS?

With our focus now Out of Africa, let’s return to the main premise itself – telecom wars. According to data from Trai, as of 31 December 2017, Airtel had 24.85% of subscriber market share, Vodafone had 18.2%, Idea Cellular 16.83% and Reliance Jio 13.71%. As far as revenue market share is concerned, as of 31 December, Airtel had 27.96% of revenue market share, followed by Vodafone India (20.65%), Reliance Jio (19.74%), and Idea Cellular (17.33%), data compiled by BloombergQuint showed.

With the rise of Jio, most older telcos are struggling. Today, the focus is on Airtel, and why Airtel is struggling. Simply put, three reasons:





Continued pricing aggression from Jio

Regulatory hurdles including cut in international termination rates

Subscriber preference for lower-priced bundle packs than higher ones

Reliance Jio launched free services in September 2016 and commercial services in April 2017. When it launched free services, everyone’s subscriber base was rising. Between March 2016 and September 2017, Airtel, Vodafone, and Idea added 31, 9, and 15 million subscribers each. In that period, which is since the time of its launch to September 2017, Jio had accrued 190 million subscribers.

They had to once Reliance Jio started charging for services, and subscriber growth of other operators started tapering since. According to TRAI’s telecom subscription data published in February 2018, Bharti Airtel led the telecom market with 24.85% share as of December-end. According to the data, Reliance Jio’s market share stood at 13.71%, few points lower than Vodafone’s and Idea Cellular’s market shares of 18.20% and 16.83% respectively. But, Jio recorded the highest growth rate of wireless subscribers which is 5.27%, among all telcos in the month of December.

Bloomberg reported last April that both Airtel and Jio “may raise as much as Rs 36,500 crores selling bonds as the telecom titans build a war chest in what investors hope will be the home stretch in India’s bruising tariff war.” The vast amount of 36500 crore rupees, which is about 78 percent of the total outstanding bonds of India’s top four telecom firms, signals that Airtel and Jio are getting prepared to roll out next-generation services and manage about Rs 32,000 crore of debt due in the next five years.

Raj Kothari, head of trading at Jay Capital Ltd. in London believes an end to tariff wars may be in sight after all. “After four years of intense price pain, the India telecom battle could be in its last stretch. It’s down to the big boys and they are piling up funds for that,” he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.

Bharti Airtel has said that the money would be used for treasury activities, including refinancing, and for paying off spectrum dues. Jio meanwhile hasn’t specified details of end use although data compiled by Bloomberg show that it has significant repayments due in the next few years.

The perceived advantage of Jio

What are the perceived advantages that Jio has? Have TRAI regulations benefitted Jio? What are the changes that other telcos have had to make in order to stay competitive? What has happened to those companies that have not managed to stay afloat? What has happened to their subscribers? What about data share and how does Jio fare there? In its mode to aggressively expand and acquire subscribers, does Jio have a plan for the long game? In the coming weeks, this will be our focus – what is the disruption in the galaxy? And how is each side faring? We have not even touched upon broadband and other services that these telecom operators provide. These are all questions we have to take time to answer, which is why Telecom Wars is a series, and this merely its first Episode.

There we have it – the Telecom Wars, and we have barely scratched the surface. Today’s focus, on Episode One, was on Airtel and the challenges it is facing in the wake of Jio. “In my view, Airtel’s best scenario is if Jio can be stopped and if pricing can come back to normal,” says Rohit Prasad, a professor at the Management Development Institute (MDI) and an observer of the telecom industry. “The second best scenario is the government bails out the telecom industry by making various kinds of concessions, and that second best scenario might come to pass.”

In the middle of all this emerges a glimmer of hope for Airtel in Africa. If back in 2010, you as a shareholder had criticised Airtel for venturing into Africa, perhaps now is as good a time as any to eat crow. How Airtel’s future in India evolves is anyone’s guess, but one thing is for certain – it is going to be a hard-fought war."

Just two telecom operators, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio, have committed to invest Rs 74,000 crore this year alone, which is more than 10 percent of the total government estimate, COAI Director General Rajan S Mathews said.

""Telecom operators are investing USD 10 billion. Half of investment is expected to come from just these two players,"" he told PTI in an interview.

The government draft of the new telecom policy (NTP) -- 'National Digital Communications Policy 2018' -- aims to create 40 lakh new jobs by 2022, attract USD 100 billion investment in the sector and ensure broadband coverage at 50 mbps for every citizen.

It also proposes to address the woes of debt-ridden telecom sector by reviewing licence fees, spectrum usage charges, universal service obligation fund levy -- all of which add to cost of telecom services.

Appreciating the reforms proposed in the policy, Mathews said that rationalisation of spectrum price and related charges will further fuel the investments in the sector.

""If the policy gets implemented as proposed in the draft, the sector will be able to attract huge amount of foreign direct investments,"" Mathews said.

The policy draft proposes adopting ""Optimal Pricing of Spectrum"" to ensure sustainable and affordable access to digital communications.

It also proposes use of mid-band spectrum, particularly the 3 GHz to 24 GHz range, for next-generation networks.

Besides, it has outlined a roadmap for transmitting signals between mobile towers in E-band (71-76/81-86 GHz) and V-band (57-64 MHz) spectrum, in line with international best practices.

Mathews said the government should start allocating spectrum in E and V bands without auction to expedite the rollout of telecom infrastructure to meet the proposed objectives such as broadband for all and increasing the share of the telecom sector in GDP to 8 percent from 6 percent at present.

""The policy proposes to allocate E and V band spectrum in line with global best practices. Nowhere in the world, these spectrum are allocated on the basis of auction. Telecom operators already pay for spectrum in auctions which come bundled with backhaul spectrum. ""The E and V bands are for backhaul services so there should be no extra charge for them,"" he said."

Telecom tribunal TDSAT has asked DoT to grant approval to Airtel-Telenor merger without any bank guarantee, according to a Bharti spokesperson.

The Department of Telecom on April 3 had asked Bharti Airtel to submit bank guarantee of around Rs 1,700 crore before approving its merger with Telenor India.

The guarantee included Rs 1,499 crore for one-time spectrum charge for the radiowaves allocated to Airtel without auction, and over Rs 200 crore for spectrum payment which Telenor has to make.

""Regarding the demand for bank guarantee, on Airtel's petition, TDSAT has yesterday directed the DoT to take the merger on record without the need to furnish a bank guarantee. We hope to get the final approval from the DoT soon,"" Bharti spokesperson said.

DoT has also sought undertaking from Airtel that the company will be liable to any pending dues with respect to merger of the two companies and all demands which may be raised by any wing of the department for Telenor India.

""A letter of compliance has already been submitted to the DoT on all the mentioned points,"" Bharti spokesperson said.

The merger will bolster Airtel's spectrum footprint in these seven circles, with the addition of 43.4 MHz spectrum in the 1800 MHz band. Telenor India runs operations in seven circles-- Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP (East), UP (West) and Assam.

DoT has asked Airtel to reduce it market share based on adjusted gross revenue (money earned from telecom services) in Bihar service area to the limit of 50 per cent, within one year from the date merger of two companies is approved."

Also, 24 out of 50 companies reported losses before tax during 2016-17, the government said.

""Based on audited/unaudited information submitted by telecom service sector companies to TRAI, the profit-before-tax (PBT) for the telecom service sector companies has decreased from Rs (-) 1,699 crore for the financial year 2015-16 to Rs (-)38,153 crore for the financial year 2016-17,"" Sinha said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha.

The note of minister's reply mentioned that the likelihood of a company getting into financial stress is high when the debt to Ebitda ratio is 4 times or above on a sustained basis.

As per data shared by Sinha, telecom major Airtel had the debt to Ebitda ratio of 3 times, Idea Cellular 5.8 times and Reliance Communications (RCom) 7.4 times.

In view of financial stress and market scenario, Idea Cellular opted for combining its wireless business with Vodafone and RCom decided to adopt strategic debt restructuring process.

Sinha said that bankruptcy petitions have been filed by Aircel and its subsidiaries before National Company Law Tribunal.

He said that during radiation audit by the vigilance arm of the Department of Telecom (DoT), it was revealed that most of the mobile towers of Aircel were switched off which led to non-generation of porting code and further causing great inconvenience of the customers.

""It has also been mentioned that the quality of service being offered to the customers is getting adversely affected...

Sunil Mittal-owned Airtel Payments Bank has been fined of Rs 5 crore by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for breaching Know Your Customer (KYC) norms.

The central bank said that a ""monetary penalty of Rs 50 million has been imposed on Airtel Payments Bank Limited for contravening the Operating Guidelines for Payments Banks and directions issued by RBI on KYC.""

Earlier this week, RBI had fined three other banks — State Bank of India (Rs 40 lakh), Axis Bank (Rs 3 crore) and Indian Overseas Bank (Rs 2 crore) — for non-compliance of RBI norms relating to detection and reporting of counterfeit notes, classification of non-performing assets (NPAs) and violation of KYC norms, respectively.

In December 2017, it was learnt that Bharti Airtel had been using the Aadhaar-eKYC based SIM verification process to open its payments bank accounts of subscribers without their ""informed consent"".

According to reports, more than 23 lakh customers had reportedly received Rs 47 crore in their Airtel bank accounts, which they did not know had been opened.

Based on complaints and adverse media reports alleging that the bank had opened customer accounts without a clear/specific consent of the customers, a supervisory visit to the bank was undertaken by RBI between November 20 and 22, 2017, the banking regulator said on its website.

It added that the supervisory visit report and other relevant documents, revealed, inter alia, contraventions of ‘Operating Guidelines for Payments Banks’ and the directions issued by RBI on KYC norms.

UIDAI had also taken strong objection to the allegations as such payments bank accounts are being linked to receive LPG subsidy granted by the government.

Following the incident, in an interim order, the UIDAI had suspended e-KYC licence key of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Airtel Payment Bank Ltd.

Airtel Payments Bank had, however, maintained that no bank account was opened without the consent of the customers.

Giving the background, RBI said that based on the documents, a Notice dated January 15, 2018 was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed for non-compliance with guidelines and directions issued by the central bank.

“After considering the bank’s reply and oral submissions made in the personal hearing, RBI came to the conclusion that the aforesaid charges of non-compliance with RBI guidelines/directions were substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty,” it said.

“At least the Aadhaar holder knows how many mobiles are linked to his/her Aadhaar number. In such cases one can complain against the mobile company to TRAI or TERM cell of DOT for fraudulently issuing SIM against their Aadhaar Number,” UIDAI said on Sunday.

Aadhaar-issuing authority UIDAI has extended the temporary permission given to Bharti Airtel for using the biometric identity for re-verification of its mobile customers till March 31.

It had last month allowed Airtel to use Aadhaar for re-verification of its mobile customers till January 10 with stiff riders after the company returned Rs 138 crore LPG subsidy which flowed into unsolicited payment bank accounts.

The Unique Identification Authority of India maintained however that Airtel Payments Bank's eKYC licence will remain suspended till final enquiry and audit report, sources privy to the development told PTI.

When contacted, an Airtel spokesperson said: ""We can confirm that the UIDAI has permitted Bharti Airtel to continue Aadhaar based e-KYC till March 31, 2018, subject to compliance to guidelines laid down by the authority.""

Both Airtel and Airtel Payments Bank had come under fire after the Sunil Mittal-led firm allegedly opened accounts of its mobile phone subscribers without seeking their ""informed consent"", and LPG subsidy worth crores was deposited into them.

The government acted swiftly in the matter and the UIDAI had temporarily barred the company from conducting Aadhaar- based SIM verification of mobile customers using eKYC process, and e-KYC of payments bank clients.

However, keeping in mind the convenience of customers and also the looming March 31 deadline given by the Supreme Court for mobile SIM re-verification, UIDAI on December 21 allowed Bharti Airtel to use Aadhaar for re-verification of its mobile customers till January 10 with stiff riders.

""We continue to engage with the authorities and have addressed all concerns that they have raised. Compliance to all guidelines is of paramount importance to us and we remain committed to this,"" the Airtel spokesperson added.

Sources said UIDAI will take a view on the issue on February 10 after taking into account the final audit report of Department of Telecom, RBI and others on the matters.

To avoid a repeat of Bharti Airtel-type fiasco, the UIDAI last month directed banks to seek an explicit consent of the beneficiary before changing the account to which the government subsidy is being remitted."
"December 22, 2017 08:03 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/startup-ivr-5-qs-to-ask-when-buying-cloud-telephony-for-your-business-2467061.html,"Shivakumar Ganesan, CEO, Exotel

Communication is an important asset for all startups, especially stockbrokers) as most of the business happens over a phone call - taking orders or talking to customers.

Today, there are many channels in play like email, chat, video conferencing, to communicate for businesses.

These channels have improved the speed at which conversations move, but a phone call still remains the most favorite because of the ease of access and use.

A phone system is integral to the operations of a stock-broking company. Yet, many companies are pushing their legacy phone systems beyond their years. The effect of this is felt when the system fails, calls are missed and deals are lost.

If you are actively thinking about upgrading your business phone system to a smart one that can handle calls, scale your business, keep your customers informed and not have you sell your soul to buy it, this is the right article for you.

When you are zeroing in on a business phone system, ask your potential partner these five questions.





How easily can you set up and manage this phone system?

A phone system should be effortless to setup and manage. This is harder to achieve with on-premise solutions or what is commonly known as EPABX systems.

The setup can only be done by a professional, the equipment is expensive, and it takes up a lot of office space. The maintenance costs and the dependence on the professional support are also high.

Cloud-based phone systems, on the other hand, enable you to communicate in a less expensive, and more streamlined manner.

Since the entire system is on the cloud, you save on real estate cost (a big factor with a lot of small offices!), maintenance and paying for a person to manage it. You can sign up, go out for a coffee, come back and see that your phone system is live- it is that simple!

This is extremely favorable where time is of the essence. For instance, the SEBI order which mandates phone call recording for stockbrokers from 1 January can be achieved easily with cloud telephony. This is not the case with an on-premise solution.

The other advantages being, you can pay as you go, add users, add IVR greetings and edit the call flow without the help of a professional.

2. What are the features available with this system?

This is an important question to ask, to check if your needs are in alignment with the features of the system.

An on-premise system has limited features - the activation takes weeks, the brokers have to be restricted to their desks, no call recording option, scaling is tough, the maintenance and update hassles are a story for another day.

With cloud telephony, you can get a simple call flow up and running in less than 30 minutes.

A warm and professional IVR greeting will make your customers feel welcome, and the employees can take calls on the go without having to be chained to their desk. Scaling is very easy, automatic and you get unlimited support as you grow.

The SEBI regulation instructs that the proof of burden will be on the broker to produce voice recordings for a disputed trade. Cloud communication products offer 24/7 call recording without any assistance.

Generating reports and insights with traditional phone systems is tedious. Cloud telephony offers exhaustive everyday reporting with information about call patterns, call productivity, call quality etc.

Here’s a list of features you should ideally look for in any cloud telephony software you choose:

1. IVR greeting

2. Multi-level IVR

3. Call Recording

4. Adding unlimited agents

5. Easy call flow builder without having to code

6. Well documented APIs (for automation and integrations)

7. Easy to understand daily reporting

3. How reliable is this telephony system?

Reliability is the one aspect that every business cares about. Cloud telephony has unique challenges because of the two building blocks it is built on- telephony and internet. The phone and internet lines in India are undependable. However, a good service provider innovates continuously to give you the best experience.

Cloud service providers usually have backups for every phone and internet service provider which ensures that even if one is experiencing a downtime, the other is active.

This level of sophistication cannot be promised by an on-premise solution. A downtime with legacy phone systems take many hours and in a lot of cases even days to resolve. This means missed calls and unhappy customers, which is not a favorable position for any business.

4. How secure is the particular cloud telephony system?

Security is a major concern when you have to entrust customer information with a third party. Contrary to the myth that security is a challenge yet to be addressed, cloud telephony is way ahead of the legacy systems in terms of security.

The data is stored in secure data centers that are hosted on servers on a cloud service which offers superior features like encrypted data storage, secure access etc. The data can also be easily retrieved at will.

5. Are there any hidden costs?

The hidden costs of a traditional phone system include installation costs, maintenance and replacement costs, connectivity costs etc.

A cloud-based phone system eliminates these costs as the cloud service provider takes care of installation, maintenance, and updates. There is no extra investment spent on infrastructure. The pricing is transparent and you pay only for the usage.

It is important that you need to be clear about needs and business regulations when you are choosing between phone systems.

You have to compare the best with the best and choose a system that allows you to pick, install and get started without having to worry about its integrity or performance every single day.

With the complexities that exist in the traditional legacy systems, cloud telephony evidently emerges a clear winner.

""Shashi has decided to move on to pursue opportunities outside of Airtel. We wish Shashi the very best for his future endeavours,"" the company said in a statement.

Arora has been working with Airtel in senior leadership roles since 2006. He was appointed MD and CEO of Airtel Payments Bank on June 1, 2016.

""He has been an asset for Airtel and over the years has contributed to the company’s growth story. Having led the operations in key telecom circles followed by building a strong DTH business, he has laid the foundation for Airtel's payments bank operations,"" the statement said.

The Unique Identity Authority of India (UIDAI) had barred Bharti Airtel and Airtel Payments Bank from conducting Aadhaar-based verification of customers using the eKYC process.

The action was taken following allegations that Bharti Airtel was using the Aadhaar-eKYC based SIM verification process to open payments bank accounts of its subscribers without their 'informed consent'.

UIDAI on Thursday allowed Bharti Airtel to use Aadhaar for re-verification of its mobile customers till January 10 with stiff riders after it returned Rs 138-crore LPG subsidy remitted to the unsolicited payments bank accounts.

It, however, maintained that Airtel Payments Bank eKYC licence will remain suspended till final enquiry and audit report."

Airtel, the India's largest telecom company with 282 million subscribers, got the temporary reprieve with conditions after Rs 138 crore Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) was repaid into 55.63 lakh original accounts of its customers, sources privy to the development told PTI.

The second interim order to this effect has been passed by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) keeping in view convenience of customers and also the looming March 31 deadline given by the Supreme Court for mobile SIM re-verification.

The authority will take a view on the issue after it receives a report from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Telecom Department on January 10.

The UIDAI has asked both the RBI and the telecom department to conduct an audit of systems, processes, applications, documentations followed by Bharti Airtel ""to ensure that the company is in compliance with their license conditions"".

""UIDAI has not allowed Airtel Payment Bank Limited to use eKYC license key and it shall remain deactivated until further notice,"" the source said citing the latest order.

As per the conditions imposed on Airtel, the company would have sent messages to its customers within 24 hours that their DBT accounts have been reverted to the originally designated bank account.

Airtel will also inform its customers in the next 24 hours that the direct benefit transfers received in their Airtel payment bank accounts have been duly reversed to original bank accounts.

As per another rider, Airtel can use the e-KYC and authentication service only for re-verification and issuance of SIM cards.

It will not be allowed to leverage the same for obtaining the consent of the Aadhaar holder for opening bank accounts, wallet, DTH or any other goods or services, the source added.

Both Airtel and Airtel Payments bank came under fire after the Sunil Mittal-led firm allegedly opened accounts of its mobile phone subscribers without seeking their ""informed consent"", and LPG subsidy worth crores was deposited into these accounts.

The government acted swiftly in the matter and UIDAI, in a strong move late last week, temporarily barred the company from conducting Aadhaar-based SIM verification of mobile customers using eKYC process, and e-KYC of payments bank clients."

A decision has also been made to temporarily halt the current provision that is followed to overwrite existing subsidy-linked accounts with new Aadhaar-linked accounts.

As per a report in The Economic Times, the cabinet secretariat meeting held last week has asked banks to temporarily halt the current process for next ten days till their core banking software was amended to adopt the new system.

The new decision comes against the backdrop of recent allegations that emerged against Bharti Airtel for misusing Aadhaar cards of its customers. The telecom firm had used the electronic know your customer (e-KYC) verification data of its customers to open bank accounts without informing or taking consent from them.

These accounts, that were started on its payments bank, were later turned into accounts to which all subsidy payments, including cooking gas subsidies of close to 50 lakh customers that totaled around Rs 167 crore were directed to.

In response to this, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) had temporarily barred Bharti Airtel and its payments bank from using Aadhaar linking for mobile verification or opening new accounts.

This has also highlighted the existing loopholes in the system that need an urgent overhaul prompting the officials to take action.

""We believe that it will stem some of the over-enthusiasm by companies to make their own accounts as primary accounts for receiving government subsidy without the explicit consent of the customer,"" an official with the DBT mission was quoted saying in the report.

These new reformations will include steps to ensure that customer consent will be taken before any action is taken in relation to the subsidy accounts including changes in accounts selected to get subsidies."

As the telecom sector consolidates, Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal has said that his company is open to acquiring debt-ridden Aircel, in an interview with The Economic Times.

Speaking to the newspaper, Mittal said that Airtel was open to acquisition talks with Aircel. He added that Aircel has two options, either to join Vodafone-Idea or go ahead with Airtel.

""Whenever there will be a possibility of a conversation, I have no doubt, we will be a part of that conversation,"" he said.

Aircel's debt was earlier pegged at around Rs 18,000 crore but was partly adjusted after it sold its 2100 MHz spectrum to Airtel for Rs 3,000 crore.

In October, Reliance Communications (RCom) had called off its merger with the ailing Aircel, following legal and regulatory hurdles.

Last week, Aircel had denied media reports that it was shutting down in 14 circles and said that it was trying to build a profitable business.

Airtel's acquisition spree

In October, the company announced merger of its mobile operations with struggling Tata Teleservices. According to the deal, Airtel would acquire Tata's consumer mobile business in 19 circles.

The Sunil Mittal-led telecom firm had also fully acquired Tikona Digital Network and bought Telenor's ailing Indian subsidiary, Telenor India."

Bharti Airtel has said that it is interested in buying selected spectrum and some equipment of Reliance Communications (RCom), according to a report by The Economic Times.

Lenders are currently in the process of selling RCom's assets in a bid to recover some portions of the roughly Rs 45,000-crore debt.

When asked about Airtel's interest in RCom’s assets that are being put for sale by lender, a company spokesperson for Bharti Airtel told the newspaper, ""We have expressed our interest only in buying select spectrum and some equipment.""

According to the report, Airtel could be contesting Reliance Jio for the 850 megahertz (MHz) band spectrum which is considered to be highly efficient for 4G services. The proceeds of the sale will be going to the lenders as debt recovery.

Other companies in the sector, tower providers Indus, Bharti Infratel and Brookfield are also considered to be interested in purchasing RCom's towers.

In a bid to improve its spectrum holdings to taking on Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea Cellular, in what has become a highly competitive market, the Sunil Mittal-led company has been buying stressed assets in the telecom sector, and spectrum.

Here are some of Airtel's recent acquisitions:

Telenor

In February this year, Airtel bought Telenor's ailing Indian subsidiary, Telenor India. According to the deal, Airtel took over Telenor India's liabilities related to licence fees and lease obligations for mobile towers.

The deal which gave Airtel 44 million additional users, did not involve any cash payment to Telenor. It also accessed Telenor India's 43.4 MHz spectrum in the 1,800 MHz band.

Aircel's 4G spectrum

In April 2016, Airtel entered into an Rs 30,000-crore-agreement with debt-ridden Aircel to take over its 2,300 MHz spectrum band across eight circles.

Tata Teleservices

In October, the company announced merger of its mobile operations with struggling Tata Teleservices. According to the deal, Airtel would acquire Tata's consumer mobile business in 19 circles.

The merger was done on debt-free, cash-free basis. The deal also gave Airtel access to Tata's 1,800, 2,100 and 850 MHz bands spectrum, all widely used for 4G.

Tikona

In September this year, Airtel announced that it had fully acquired Tikona Digital Network's share capital. Earlier, the company had announced a plan to purchase Tikona's 4G airwaves for Rs 1,600 crore.

The acquisition gave the Sunil Mittal-led telecom company access Tikona's 4G spectrum in five circles, namely Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Western Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan.

Bharti Airtel said on Wednesday that it was looking to spend 250 billion rupees (USD 3.9 billion) this financial year on its networks, a quarter more than its initial forecast and mainly to speed up the expansion of its 4G mobile broadband network in India.

The boost in capital expenditure comes at a time when the Indian market leader is facing stiff competition from Reliance Jio, operator of the entirely new 4G network which cost owner Reliance Industries about USD 30 billion to build.

Launching its services just over a year ago, Jio has disrupted the world's second-biggest wireless market by customers with its cut-price offerings.

Mobile internet traffic in the Indian market is also growing rapidly as more users upgrade to smartphones from basic and feature phones, using the Internet for everything from watching movies to shopping online.

""Considering the explosion in data traffic in India, we believe it is expedient to activate our 4G rollout in terms of coverage and also build additional capacity in existing geographies along with fibre connectivity and backhaul,"" Nilanjan Roy, global chief financial officer at Bharti Airtel, said on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday.

""We believe that tactically advancing of these future capex spends ... will augment our growth and revenue market share ambitions,"" he said.

Bharti Airtel, which operates across 17 countries in Asia and Africa, had initially forecast capital expenditure of 200 billion rupees for the year to March 2018.

The company on Tuesday reported its smallest quarterly profit in nearly five years, 77 percent lower from a year earlier.

The result was still better than expected by analysts who applauded the company's ability to protect margins and hold its own in the face of competition, sending its share price up by more than 8 percent on Wednesday to the highest level in almost a decade.

Seeking immediate relief for the stressed telecom sector, older operators -- Airtel and Idea Cellular -- today slammed high levies, increase in spectrum cost and regulatory norms.

""Taxation on industry is very high. It is in the range of 29-32 per cent. Spectrum cost is one of the highest and tariff being one of the lowest. All of this need to change to realise dream and vision of Digital India,"" Bharti Airtel MD and CEO for India and South Asia, Gopal Vittal said at the India Mobile Congress here.

Investment by Bharti Airtel in the last 2 years has been more than that of the past 20 years put together, he said.

Vittal observed that though mergers and acquisitions are in place, the pace at which these are executed by the government is ""very low"".

He acknowledged that the government is involved in easing norms for doing business, but maintained that the industry is facing problems on various fronts.

Aseem ManchandaCNBC Awaaz

On July 21 (Comptroller and Auditor General of India) CAG had pulled six telecom companies for understating their revenue. CAG, in its report, had stated that Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular, Reliance Communications, Aircel and Tata had understated their revenue by Rs 61,064.5 crore over the five-year period from 2010-11 to 2014-15. This leads to the government losing out Rs 12,229.24 crore as payment from spectrum usage charges and interest. These charges are computed by using telecom companies’ revenue as the base. On the basis of this report government has once again appointed special auditors to check irregularities in telecom company’s accounts.

A history of Abuse

This is not the first time CAG has pointed out anomalies in telecom companies' books. In March 2016, CAG had also tabled its report on revenue loss due to wrong calculation of AGR. In its report, CAG had claimed that six major telecom companies Airtel, Vodafone, Idea, Reliance Communications, Tata, and Aircel -had understated gross revenue of over Rs 46,000 crore for a period between 2006-07 and 2009-10 and denied the government its share of income which was estimated at more than Rs 12,400 crore.

See Table:

On the basis of the CAG report, the Department of Telecom (DoT) had appointed a special auditor for reassessment of the telecom companies' accounts. After the assessment, DoT had issued demand-cum-show cause notices to six private telecom companies for a total amount of Rs. 29,474 crores on account of license fee. This demand also included interest and penalty for not paying license fees on time. Results of this interest and penalty exceeds actual license fees demand.

*This figure is the revised license fees demand which includes Rs 3794 Crore of license fees demand already raised by DoT on account of Regular and Special Audit Demands. The License fees is calculated as a percentage of Adjusted Gross Revenue.

Disputed Definition

The definition of Adjusted Gross Revenue is under litigation since 2003. Fourteen years gone by and the matter is presently pending in the Supreme Court. Supreme Court has barred DoT from taking any coercive step to recover the outstanding dues from telcos.

As per the CAG the telecom players suppressed revenues through different accounting adjustments for commissions or discounts paid to distributors, promotional schemes such as free talk-time, as well as discounts for users of roaming services.

The CAG has also stated that exchequer was also shortened of revenue by telcos by excluding forex gains, interest income, sale of investment, profit on sale of fixed assets and dividend income from their reported aggregated gross revenue. The telecom operators share a percentage of their aggregated gross revenue with the government as annual license fees.

Bumpy Road Ahead for Telecom Companies

So far all the demands raised by DoT are pending in various courts. However CAG, Special Auditors appointed by government are confident that government demand is justified, and government will be able to win all these cases. Now, on the basis of assessment for a period between 2010-11 to 2014-15 government is ready with another set of notices. These notices will start hitting telecom companies from September.

Finally, if government wakes from deep slumber and fights the AGR case in the Supreme Court pro-actively then telecom companies will have a tough time in future."

Telecom major Airtel today said it has sold 6.7 crore shares in its subsidiary Bharti Infratel for over Rs 2,570 crore.

The sale was done for Rs 380.6 per share, a 4 per cent discount to previous day's closing price.

""Bharti Airtel will primarily use the proceeds from this sale to reduce its debt,"" the company said in a statement.

Bharti Airtel via its wholly owned subsidiary Nettle Infrastructure Investments divested 67.53 million shares of its subsidiary Bharti Infratel through a secondary share sale in the stock market.

""Following the closure of this transaction, Bharti Airtel and its wholly owned subsidiaries together have an equity holding of 58 per cent in Bharti Infratel,"" the statement said.

UBS and JP Morgan were joint placement agents for the transaction."

Reliance Jio had already picked up as many as 109 million subscribers by April this year.Considering that the telecom operator had been in the business for only eight months back then, this was an impressive feat.

One could argue that the rapid addition of customers would not have happened if not for Jio offering all its services free of cost.

However, that argument was put to rest when Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani confirmed at its recently-held annual general meeting that most of Jio's subscribers are now paying subscribers.

The operator's tariffs have started a price war in the already competitive market, leading to severe losses for other domestic telecom operators. Its rapid growth has certainly come at the cost of other Indian telecom companies' market share.

Is consolidation the way to go?

Almost every other player in the telecom sector barring Jio has been in talks with other players to join hands in their fight against the Mukesh Ambani-owned operator.

In February, Telecom Secretary JS Deepak said that the Indian telecom market would eventually consolidate to have only five major players.

He further said ""consolidation is going to be very good for India as we are likely to get four private and one government player (BSNL-MTNL), which is ideal.""

According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), there were more than 1.18 billion wireless telephone subscribers in the country in April 2017 who were being serviced by as many as 12 operators.

Key mergers and acquisitions currently in the pipeline:

Airtel and Telenor India

Airtel's acquisition of Telenor India (previously known as Uninor) received the National Company Law Tribunal's (NCLT) approval on Thursday.

With the takeover, Airtel is set to gain Telenor's spectrum in the 1800 MHz band across seven telecom circles. The takeover will also help India's largest operator boost its market share after adding all of Telenor India's 49.34 million subscribers. (as of April 2017).

Vodafone and Idea Cellular

India's second largest (Vodafone) and third largest (Idea) telecom operators are now in the process of merging to form what would become the country's largest operator. It will also be the world's second largest telecom service provider.

According to the terms of the deal, Idea's parent entity Aditya Birla Group will gradually raise its stake in the combined entity while the Vodafone Group will reduce its stake until both their shares are equal.

They are, however, battling regulatory challenges as the combined entity would exceed spectrum limits.

Reliance Communications and Aircel

In April 2017, the two companies approved a merger that would create the country's fourth-largest network by revenue and subscribers. RComm and Aircel's parent firm Maxis will own 50% stake each in the merged entity.

The two companies are now waiting for a final approval from the NCLT. The proposed merger is crucial for RComm as it will retire Rs 25,000 crore of debt from its total debt of around Rs 45,000 crore.

Other talks

Bharti Airtel has pulled the plug on mega-merger talks with the Tata Group. The merger would have seen Tata Communications, Tata Teleservices, Airtel and direct-to-home (DTH) TV services Tata Sky and Airtel DTH come together as one. Bharti Airtel would have also taken control of Tata's overseas cables.

However, the Sunil Mittal-led group decided not to go ahead with the proposal after SingTel (Singapore Telecommunications), which holds one-third stake in Airtel said that the company should focus on closing its acquisition of Telenor India and selling stake in Bharti Infratel.

According to a report in The Times of India, Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran is working in a time-bound manner to fix their ailing telecom businesses and has asked his 'deal-makers' to explore all options.

Battle lines are drawn yet again between large incumbent telecom operators and disruptive recent entrant Jio (owned by Reliance Industries). This time the dispute is over interconnect usage charge (IUC) or mobile interconnect charge (MTC), a charge that is paid by the service provider whose subscriber makes the call to the service provider in whose network the call is received. So if a caller of Idea calls a subscriber of Airtel, Idea pays Airtel 14 paise/min. Idea recovers this amount from its subscriber; the receiving party doesn’t pay anything in India.

IUC is important not only from the perspective of operators as it gives them a revenue stream, but it is also a key component of voice tariffs and, therefore, also has a bearing on consumers’ monthly bills. This underscores the importance of the battle between the incumbent telecom operators and Jio.

In order to understand why smaller operators are asking for lower IUC while incumbents are asking for a higher charge, it is important to understand how the termination charge can be used as a lever by operators to change the competitive dynamics.

For instance, if mobile termination rates are too high then smaller operators – a group that currently includes Jio -- will never be able to attract new customers as costs would be high. A Trai consultation paper to review interconnect charge in 2014 highlighted this point and said: “A large network may also seek to foreclose entry by charging high interconnection prices, which eliminates or weakens smaller competitors for the same pool of retail customers. In addition, a large network will, other things being equal, benefit from high interconnection charges which enhance its revenues.” Smaller operators point out that globally IUC has been consistently coming down as a percentage of voice tariffs.

In fact, the share of IUC in overall voice tariff is between 1-13 percent in other global markets. In India, IUC accounts for 45 percent of voice tariff assuming voice tariffs are at 31 paise per minute. That said, it’s worth noting that in absolute terms India’s voice tariffs and interconnect charges are the lowest in the world and the share of IUC has been rising because tariffs have been driven down by competition.

Interconnect charges have never been an easy subject for India’s regulators and all decisions to lower them have been challenged by the incumbents in courts. Interconnect usage charge was last reviewed and lowered to 14 paise/min from 20 paise/min in 2015, when Rahul Khullar was the Trai Chairman.

The regulator has now decided to review the termination charge again to evaluate if Bill and Keep (BAK, a regime where each operator bills its customers and keeps the money) can be implemented. Most regulators across the world have moved to a regime of low interconnect charges or BAK; BAK works best where there is symmetry in traffic or there are two operators, like in the United States.

The technological reason for IUC to fall is a change in how voice traffic is carried on mobile networks. As telcos migrate to the next generation IP (internet protocol) networks, the cost of carrying voice traffic is zero as carrying voice in the form of data packets requires little bandwidth.

The IP network carries voice on LTE (VoLTE) or voice over internet protocol (VoIP). In 2014 when the telecom regulator had discussed the migration from GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) to VoLTE, the assessment was that the time was not right and operators needed time. Now with Jio having launched its voice services on VoLTE and other operators looking to launch later this year, the argument to lower termination charges sounds logical.

Voice and SMS business for telecom operators across the world have been on the wane for years thanks to over-the-top (OTT) apps like WhatsApp and Skype. Between 2012 and 2018, global telcos are expected to lose USD 386 billion in revenues, says Fortune magazine. In several world markets voice is already free; this has been enabled by telcos moving to VoIP or VoLTE. The same would have played out in India, Jio or no Jio, if data and handset prices had been allowed to fall.

At Rs 250/GB of data and expensive handsets, data penetration did not pick up until Jio shook things up. There is plenty of demand for data in India: currently the country uses 120 crore GB a month, up eight times from last year’s figure. A higher IUC on voice would skew Jio’s economics and affect its financials.

Jio has launched its services on an IP network and voice services are offered through LTE or VoLTE. However, when the call terminates on GSM networks, subscribers of those other networks can receive the call even if they don't have VoLTE handsets. Incumbent telecom operators want interconnect charges be doubled from the current 14 paise/minute as the asymmetry in voice traffic has increased substantially after the launch of Reliance Jio’s services and announced free voice services. With the increase in traffic, the incumbents are claiming that they need to make additional investments to support a ‘tsunami of traffic’.

However, this argument of incumbents telecom, experts say, is hard to comprehend because they are asking for higher charges to support legacy technology. An industry veteran asks: ""Why should consumers pay for an inefficient, legacy technology?"" If the interconnect charges are high then Jio would not be able to price its services attractively and take data to remote parts of the country even if its own cost of voice is significantly lower than those of the incumbents. Jio is seeking to change the industry’s dynamics by offering voice free and push data usage. If Jio has to offer services at attractive rates, then it needs to also bring down costs and IUC is a big component of its cost structure. It is for this reason the Jio is arguing for either a very low mobile termination charge or BAK.

Industry experts believe that incumbents will find it very hard to justify higher interconnect charges only so that operators can support legacy 2G networks. Former regulators and telecom experts agree that incumbents demand higher IUC when networks are moving to IP and voice will be delivered on VoLTE is rather strange.

A very senior retired government official, who was closely associated with the sector, says Jio’s argument for zero IUC is valid if networks are moving to VoLTE as the cost of carrying voice is negligible or zero on such IP networks. Airtel, Vodafone and Idea have talked themselves into a tough spot by announcing a shift to VoLTE and asking for higher charges to support an outdated technology.

At a simplistic level, voice delivered through IP is very different from 2G. According to some estimates, voice requires 18 kbps throughput which is equal to less than 0.13 MB per minute data equivalent. With data prices falling to Rs 10/GB this translates into 0.13 paise per minute. An IUC of 14 paise per minute would amount to substantially high per GB rate. The incumbents are also asking for a floor price for voice; this militates against the broader national aim of getting the best prices for consumers.

Industry stalwarts claim that incumbents want to restrict Jio by ratcheting up interconnect charges because Jio is well placed to offer voice and data services across India, as it has spectrum in the sub-1 Ghz band (850 Mhz), while incumbents don’t have it in the sub-1 Ghz band yet. For VoLTE sub-1 Ghz spectrum is critical. This means that if Airtel, Vodafone or Idea have to launch VoLTE it would be on 1800 Mhz or 2300 Mhz, which are not very efficient for launch of voice over LTE. So while incumbents would be able to offer voice on GSM technology in rural areas, delivering data would take them longer. Jio, on the other, hand can offer voice and data in the remotest part of the country as it has built a network that is capable of delivering that.

Experts argue that while the regulator may find it hard to justify BAK, mobile termination charge can only go down from here as the shift in technology has driven down costs for voice, too. Globally, the move is towards unlimited voice and data: Telcos are moving to speed-based pricing instead of per GB and per minute rates.

Broadband speed testing firm OpenSignal has found Airtel to be the fastest 4G service provider by incorporating an additional parameter of 'average peak speed' in its test.

The UK-based firm has also alleged 'discrepancy' in methodology used by the telecom regulator Trai compared to the method it uses to measure the speed.

""Airtel's average peak speed test was 56.6 Mbps, which is 5 times faster than its average 4G download test of 11.5 Mbps,"" A blog post on OpenSignal website said.

The test for the report was conducted between December 1, 2016 - Feb 28, 2017 in the metro cities of Delhi and Mumbai and the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

In the report, OpenSignal has found average 4G speed on Jio network to be the slowest at 3.9 Mbps.

However, in the new parameter of average peak speed, it found Jio next only to Airtel.

""We measured Jio's average peak speed at 50 Mbps, which is nearly 13 times faster than its everyday 4G speed download speed of 3.9 Mbps,"" the blog said.

As per data published by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), Reliance Jio has been the fastest 4G service provider since the last seven months.

Trai collects data through its mobile application Trai MySpeed from users across the country on real-time basis. The users of the application can check the speed of their service provider anywhere and anytime and they have option to submit the test result to the regulator.

OpenSignal alleged ""discrepancy"" in Trai's methodology claiming that ""Trai is measuring operator performance under ideal conditions, while OpenSignal's methodology tests the typical everyday experience of consumers.""

The firm said that it feels average peak speed is an accurate measure of a 4G connection under the most optimised conditions, and it gives an indication of what consumers might really experience when unfettered by congestion or technical limitations.

It said that Jio's networks are capable of supporting some incredibly fast LTE connections when conditions are ideal but as per the data that OpenSignal has ""those ideal conditions were far more rare for Jio subscribers than for customers of other operators"".

OpenSignal attributed slow speed on Jio's network to congestion.

It said that Jio has added over 100 million customers in few months and has been offering them unlimited access to mobile data.

""That kind of heavy usage is bound to tax any network, forcing users to vie against one another for bandwidth. Our data shows that Jio's slow average 4G speeds aren't a technical limitation, but rather a capacity bottleneck,"" the blog said.

OpenSignal said that as Jio adds more capacity — either through new spectrum or building more cell sites — or if Jio's mobile data consumption levels drop then its typical download speeds should increase."
"July 17, 2017 08:12 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/current-affairs-trends/heres-how-payments-banks-will-make-money-without-lending-2327891.html,"Payments banks, a new class of institutions aimed at deepening financial inclusion, are set to redefine banking business models in India.

They are sewing up a thread of unorthodox revenue streams including data monetisation, cross-selling of financial products, forming credit access platforms and creating alternate merchant payment models to get around the constraint of not being able to lend.

These pre-dominantly digital companies can accept deposits of up to Rs 100,000 per customer, but cannot give loans. This rule makes them ineligible to earn money from interest rates, the primary income source for conventional banks.

Airtel Payments Bank, Paytm and India Posts Payments Bank have already launched operations. Finotech, Vodafone and Reliance are expected to launch their payments banks soon.

“A lot is happening from the technology, regulatory and legislation perspective,” said Rishi Gupta, managing director and chief executive officer, Fino Payments Bank.

Of every Rs 100 of deposits collected, payment banks will have to invest at least Rs 75 (75 percent) in approved government securities, and may choose to park the remaining Rs 25 (25 percent) in current and fixed deposits of conventional commercial banks.

Government bonds and bank fixed deposits are currently fetching annual returns of about 7 percent, limiting the payments banks’ ability to widen their margins and offer attractive interest earnings to customers to save money with them.

According to experts, payments banks are likely to offer micro-savings options, given that most of their customers will have a propensity to make small, infrequent savings. This could mean customers could be allowed to maintain FD accounts with amounts of as low as Rs 100.

“While savings is core to banking, very few banks have taken an approach toward encouraging micro-savings, i.e. making acceptable savings amount to near zero,” said a recent report entitled 'Alternate revenue models for Payments Banks in India' by EY, an audit and consulting firm.

“Payments Banks need to focus on developing products that significantly reduce the minimum denomination that needs to be accumulated to be put into a savings product,” the EY report said.

These companies are also likely to offer a suite of products by cross-selling services such as insurance and mutual funds through strategic alliances with non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), asset management companies (AMCs) and even conventional large banks.

“Payments bank cannot lend on their own, but can offer credit products on behalf of partner banks,” said Gupta. “We are following a two-pronged approach, (earning through) transaction fees on the banking activity that the customer does and (through) cross-selling charges”.

Cross-selling charges are fees that a bank can earn, as commission, by partnering with other financial institutions and providing services such as insurance and loans.

Vivek Bekgavi, partner-fintech leader, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), an audit and consulting firm, said that said that tie-ups with other banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), mutual funds and insurance companies could be the “main source of income” for payments banks.

Payments banks can also develop alternate merchant payment models with low transaction costs for merchants and customers.

“The idea with payments bank is that they can make money from the merchants’ side,” Bekgavi said.

While some banks have decided to charge a fee from customers on cash withdrawals from bank branch, others will charge Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cash withdrawals above a certain limit.

“Payments Banks can make customer transactions, including merchant acceptance, free as long as they are within the bank’s ecosystem. This will incentivise merchants to accept cashless payments, reduce the acquiring costs and positively impact the overall system. However, to prevent cash-outs, free withdrawals can be limited,” the EY report said.

Data monetisation can turn out to be another major revenue source for these banks in the years to come.

After it reaches a critical mass, analysing data along with additional customer profile parameters can lead to valuable insights about spend patterns and preferences. These insights can enable payments banks to explore new revenue opportunities, EY said in its report.

These banks will generate a high volume of consumer transactions-led data, which will include transactions such as mobile recharges, utility bill payments, e-commerce spends and offline merchant transactions.

A significant value can be unlocked if this data is analysed and consumer insights are be monetised, which can help in very precise targeted marketing without compromising on data privacy.

“Payments bank need to have a very strong system of data analytics,” Bekgavi said.

While many experts believe that payments banks will take about five years, on an average, to break even, Gupta was confident that Fino Payments Bank will turn profits after the third year.

“We expect to break even in three years’ time,” said Gupta."

Idea Cellular today said at the IMG meeting that it supports lower data prices but the government policy framework should allow operators to recover their network costs.

Vodafone, on the other hand, said that call connect charge - currently at 14 Paise - is already ""below cost"" and any further cut in these inter-operator charges could hurt rural coverage.

Besides, it favoured lowering of spectrum usage charges (or doing away with it) as also that the USO levy should be reduced to 3 per cent from 5 per cent and then be phased out.

Making presentations before the inter-ministerial group (IMG), incumbent operators, including Airtel, flagged various issues facing the industry, leading to huge debts. Speaking to reporters after its meeting, a top Idea official said: ""Government has choice of any policy...but it should cover costs.

All policy framework everywhere says that cost of network should be recovered."" The Idea official further said that the company is completely in agreement that data prices need to come down. Flagging the high incidence of taxation faced by the industry, the official said levies like licence fee, spectrum usage charges and USO should be subsumed by GST, the new indirect tax regime to be rolled out from July 1.

Vodafone too has suggested that licence fee be subsumed by the Goods and Services Tax and if that's not possible then GST rate should be reduced to 5 per cent from 18 per cent for telecom services. Airtel officials, however, refused to comment on the presentation made to the government.

The IMG, constituted to suggest policy reform to mitigate sector's financial stress, has been holding dialogue with individual operators this entire week. It has already met senior executives from Reliance Jio, Reliance Communications, Tata Teleservices and Aircel. It has also held discussions with telecom PSUs Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd too.

The IMG also met four major lenders, including SBI, who voiced concerns over ""stress"" in the telecom sector and flagged possibility of defaults by debt-laden operators. The incumbent operators have been vocal about the onslaught of free voice and data offers by the aggressive newcomer Reliance Jio (RJio), and its impact on the industry's revenue in 2016-17.

Reliance Jio earlier this week, however, ascribed the financial stress in the telecom sector to existing operators like Bharti Airtel and Idea running businesses on debt and investing heavily in unrelated sectors. It alleged that incumbent operators have been reluctant in infusing equity and hence the financial stress is their own creation.

The operators on the other hand cite Rs 4.6 lakh crore cumulative debt, and are making a case for urgent relief measures like extension on payment of deferred spectrum liability to a period of 20 years, and cut in licence fee and spectrum usage charges.

With over 1.16 billion mobile users, India is the second largest telecom market in the world, after China. Telecom regulator Trai also met all the operators yesterday to discuss the industry's financial difficulties and measures that can be taken to ease the situation. Idea asked Trai to fix a minimum floor price for voice calls and data offerings."

The group, constituted to suggest policy reforms in the telecom sector, asked the banks to come back with more information like level of exposure to telecom sector and extent of 'stress' in the next meeting, an official who was present in the meeting told PTI.

""They (the banks) say that the sector may be in stress and there can be defaults ... We have asked the banks for more data,"" said the official after emerging from the two-hour long meeting with the lenders.

Punjab National Bank and Axis Bank are the two other lenders that attended the IMG meeting today.

The IMG may meet these banks once more but the date for the same has not been finalised yet.

The group, comprising officials from telecom and finance ministries, is meeting operators and lenders to discuss financial difficulties faced by the telecom industry, whose debt burden stands at a whopping Rs 4.6 lakh crore.

One of the officials said that SBI's exposure to telecom companies is in the range of Rs 80,000 crore.

An executive of PNB said that if revenues of operators have come down ""a solution has to be found"", but remained tight lipped about the measures that the bank proposed in the meeting.

Last month, SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya in a letter to the Telecom Secretary had stated that the stress in the telecom sector has reached ""unsustainable levels"".

""The stress in the sector has reached highly unsustainable levels after the entry of new players and launch of free services which led to erosion of top-line and EBITDA of the telecom service providers,"" the letter had said.

The letter had noted that the total EBITDA in the sector on an annualised basis is Rs 65,000 crore, which is ""clearly unsustainable"" for debt of more than Rs 4 lakh crore.

The earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation or EBITDA is a measure of a company's operational performance.

SBI had also sought immediate and large scale intervention to ""stem the slide"".

The inter-ministerial group is next scheduled to meet the big three operators, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular, on June 16.

The panel has already met senior executives from Reliance Jio, Reliance Communications, Tata Teleservices and Aircel. It has held discussions with telecom PSUs Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd too this week.

Meanwhile, the telecom regulator will meet all the operators tomorrow to understand the financial difficulties being faced by the industry and measures that can be taken to ease the situation.

The incumbent operators have been vocal about the onslaught of free voice and data offers by the aggressive newcomer Reliance Jio (RJio), and its impact on the industry's revenue in FY2016-17.

Incidentally, India, with over 1.16 billion mobile users is the second largest telecom market in the world, after China.

But telecom operators lament they are facing pressure on income and profitability on account of competition intensified by the entry of Reliance Jio -- owned by Mukesh Ambani.

Last month, Idea Cellular reported a consolidated loss of Rs 325.6 crore in the three-month period ended March 2017, hurt by the severe tariff war.

India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel, too, reported its lowest quarterly profit in four years as net earnings plunged 72 per cent in January-March, hit by ""sustained predatory pricing"" by Jio."

In contrast to the ‘high-speed’ 4G speed claims by telecom companies, Open Signal’s report on 4G/LTE performance paints a dismal picture. India’s average download speed on a 4G network is pegged at mere 5.14 Mbps, the lowest among the 75 countries analysed in the report.

India is at the bottom with Costa Rica, way below countries such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Indonesia. The average 4G speed is one-third of the world average and just one Mbps more than the average global speed for 3G networks.

Singapore and South Korea continued their dominance in the list with a speed of more than 40 Mbps. They also topped the list of 4G network availability in the world. India ranked 15th in the world in terms of 4G network availability.

According to the report, the 4G speed in India has dropped by more than one percent, in the last six months. This, even as 4G availability has surged to 82 percent in March 2017 from 72 in September 2016, largely due to free 4G services offered by Reliance Jio Infocomm.

“Jio's nationwide 4G launch in September attracted 100 million LTE subscribers, making 4G services far more accessible in India but at the expense of lower average speeds,” the report read. “India shot up our LTE availability rankings, reflecting a rare instance in which a single operator can have an outsized impact on a mobile market in just a short time,” the report added.

The Delhi High Court today sought the government's response on Vodafone's plea against telecom regulator TRAI's recommendation to impose a Rs 1,050 crore penalty on it for not providing interconnectivity to Reliance Jio.

Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva also issued notice to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and sought its reply to Vodafone's plea alleging that despite the DoT asking it to reconsider its recommendation, it did not do so.

The court listed the matter for hearing on July 19.

Telecom major Vodafone told the court that the TRAI had first made the recommendation in October 21, 2016, following which it was sent back to the regulator by the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) for reconsideration.

However, the regulator on May 24 reiterated its earlier recommendation, the telecom major said and added that this decision was taken without hearing it.

It also claimed that while DoT was concurring with it, TRAI was taking a different stand.

The court then asked why should there be a stay of the recommendation as the DoT was yet to take a final view on it.

In response to the query, Vodafone said that RJIO had used the recommendation to lodge a complaint with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) alleging unfair trade practice by telecom majors, including Airtel and Idea.

Vodafone, in its application, has also said that pursuant to the complaint, the CCI has reportedly initiated an investigation against it and the other telecom majors.

The application has been filed by the telecom major in its main petition challenging the TRAI's October 2016 recommendation.

TRAI had earlier told the court that it was not required to give a hearing to Vodafone before it gave its recommendation and admitted that no such hearing was given to the telecom major.

TRAI has recommended imposition of a fine of Rs 50 crore for each of the 21 circles of Vodafone, except in Jammu and Kashmir, coming to a total of Rs 1,050 crore. Similar recommendations were issued by the regulator against Airtel and Idea."

Social networking giant Facebook has rolled out in India, its 'Express Wi-Fi' service that offers Internet facility through public hotspots to users in rural parts of the country.

The commercial roll out of the project comes a year after Facebook pulled the plug on the controversial 'Free Basics' programme that drew severe criticism from advocates of net neutrality.

Unlike Free Basics that provided access to selected websites for free, Express Wi-Fi works on a ""paid"" model and the access will not be restricted to any particular websites.

Users can log onto public wi-fi hotspots made available through partner telecom operators and buy daily, weekly or monthly data packs being sold through local entrepreneurs.

Facebook has also onboarded as a partner, telecom giant Bharti Airtel, which will deploy over 20,000 wi-fi hotspots over the next few months.

""India's population is about 1.3 billion people, but only 390 million are connected to the Internet. Express Wi-Fi is part of our global initiative and we want to expand Internet connectivity to underserved locations,"" Facebook Asia Pacific Head of Connectivity Solutions Munish Seth told PTI.

He added that Facebook is working with internet services providers (ISPs) and over 500 local entrepreneur retailers.

Internet user base in the country has seen a significant jump in the last few years, helped by smartphones becoming more affordable and data prices falling, especially after Reliance Jio rolled out services.

Tech giant Google has also rolled out free Internet access through public wi-fi hotspots at various railway stations in partnership with RailTel.

""The market still remains under-penetrated and all these efforts (by others) will help expand it further,"" Seth said.

Asked about the role Facebook will play in the programme, he said the company will just provide the platform and solutions.

""We will not charge the ISP/telecom operator or the entrepreneur. The operator decides on the pricing and will handle the data as the Internet traffic flows through their system. We are just providing the solutions,"" he added.

Facebook's Express Wi-Fi service is available through nearly 700 hotspots across the four Indian states of Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Meghalaya. Facebook had started testing Express Wi-Fi in India in 2015.

The tariffs are dependent on the operator and the validity of the plan.

The ISPs are AirJaldi in Uttarakhand, LMES in Rajasthan, Tikona in Gujarat, and roll out in Meghalaya is being carried out by a company called Shaildhar.

Express Wi-Fi is also live in four other countries -- Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria and Indonesia.

The US-based company had launched the Free Basics programme in 2015 in partnership with Reliance Communications and allowed access to selected websites.

However, it met severe criticism as critics saw this as violation of the principle of net neutrality that advocates equal treatment of all internet traffic.

Facebook finally pulled the plug on the controversy- ridden programme in India in February last year after sectoral regulator, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India barred operators from charging discriminatory rates for Internet- access based on content.

Interestingly, Facebook continues to run the Free Basics programme across many countries."

Sectoral regulator Trai will ""this month"" send to the Telecom Ministry its clarification on Rs 3,050 crore penalty it had sought from Airtel, Vodafone and Idea for denying call connectivity to newcomer Reliance Jio.

""No, we have not written to them (Department of Telecom) yet. But we will be writing soon... We will be responding certainly this month. It will happen very quickly,"" Trai Chairman RS Sharma told PTI.

He did not give further details.

The Telecom Department, on April 5, wrote to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) asking it to give a ""reconsidered opinion"" on the penalty issue, and also outline the basis and provisions of law under which the said amount had been recommended by the regulator.

Sources familiar with the matter said that DoT, in its communication, has also asked the Trai to provide information on the number of subscribers acquired by Reliance Jio during the testing phase (that is prior to its commercial launch).

The incumbent operators and the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio clashed last year over the issue of call connectivity.

Jio cried foul that its customers were suffering from call failures as the incumbent operators were not giving it sufficient interconnect capacity. The operators, in turn, charged the newcomer of unleashing a ""tsunami"" of free traffic on their networks.

Interconnection enables mobile users to make calls to customers of other telecom networks and is, therefore, crucial for smooth functioning of mobile services.

In October last year, Trai recommended to the Telecom Department, the imposition of total penalty of Rs 3,050 crore on the three incumbent operators Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular for allegedly denying interconnectivity to the new entrant that led to deterioration in the quality of service.

As per Trai's recommendation, the penalty for Airtel and Vodafone worked out to about Rs 1,050 crore each, while in case of Idea Cellular stood at about Rs 950 crore.

The regulator, in fact, had stopped short of recommending cancellation of their telecom licences saying it may lead to significant consumer inconvenience.

However, when the issue was placed before the Telecom Commission earlier this year, the highest policy-making body of the telecom department, it favoured referring the matter back to Trai for a ""reconsidered opinion"".

The Telecom Commission asked DoT to seek clarification from Trai on nearly a dozen points, including whether the stipulated 90-day period was given to the three telecom operators for providing point of interconnection to the newcomer.

The interim application by Airtel pertains to the Summer Surprise offer of Reliance Jio under which it was giving free data and voice under Rs 303 plan.

Airtel has also objected to the continuation of scheme's benefits for those who had already subscribed to the said offer before it was withdrawn.

When contacted, Bharti Airtel declined to comment.

The matter was heard briefly today in the Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT). The next hearing will be on April 20, along with a main petition, in which Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular have challenged a Trai order that allowed free 4G service offers of Jio beyond the stipulated 90 days.

On April 6, Trai had asked Jio to withdraw its contentious 3-month 'complimentary' offer of unlimited data usage and free calls on payment of a minimum Rs 303, saying it was not in accordance with the regulatory framework.

Trai had said that Reliance Jio will be required to roll back the 3-month complimentary offer in ""shortest possible time"" but clarified that customers who had already subscribed to the said scheme could avail the benefits till June-end.

Soon after, telecom operator Vodafone approached Trai alleging that Jio was inviting last minute subscriptions to its 'Summer Surprise' offer despite the regulator finding it in violation of norms.

Jio, on April 11, unveiled a new plan of 1GB 4G data daily for 3 months at Rs 309 for its Prime members, but Airtel had dubbed it as being a case of ""old wine in a new bottle"".

Announcing its new offer, Jio said that under the Rs 309 plan it would provide ""unlimited SMS, calling and data (1GB per day at 4G speed) for 3 months on first recharge"".

For Rs 509, the company is offering unlimited SMS, calling and double the data (2GB per day) for 3 months on first recharge. The new plans with benefits for Jio Prime members is aimed at encouraging subscribers to ""live the digital life without restrictions"", Jio said in a statement.

""Considering the special benefits that are available to Jio Prime members, customers who were unable to subscribe to Jio Prime for any reason, can continue to do so by paying Rs 408 or Rs 608 (Jio Prime + recharge price) to avail these benefits,"" the statement added.

Objecting to the offer, incumbent Bharti Airtel hoped that the ""authority (TRAI) will act against this provocative disregard of their direction"".

""... We are surprised to see what Jio is doing. It violates the spirit of the TRAI directive and essentially continues with a similar plan now masquerading under a different name. This is a classic example of old wine in a new bottle,"" an Airtel spokesperson said.

Stating that the industry is in a ""very weak"" position and ""continues to bleed"", Airtel said that the financial impact that telcos are seeing does no good to customers, in the long term.

""With a weakened financial position, companies will find it difficult to raise the capital to invest and roll out broadband networks,"" Airtel cautioned. The move by Jio comes within a week of the telecom regulator asking the Mukesh Ambani telecom company to withdraw its contentious three-month 'complimentary' offer of unlimited data usage and free calls on payment of a minimum Rs 303.

TRAI, on April 6, had asked Jio to stop the 'complimentary' service offer saying it was not in accordance with the regulatory framework. TRAI had said that Jio will be required to roll back the 3-month complimentary offer in ""shortest possible time"" but clarified that customers who had already subscribed to the said scheme could avail the benefits till June-end.

Earlier this week, telecom operator Vodafone approached TRAI alleging that Jio was inviting last minute subscriptions to its 'Summer Surprise' offer despite the regulator finding it in violation of norms.

Jio had, however, countered the charges saying the company had made it amply clear that the complimentary offer would be withdrawn as soon as operationally feasible, and that customers who subscribed prior to discontinuation of the offer, remained eligible.

In a statement here today, Jio said that it has fully withdrawn the Summer Surprise offer following the advice of the telecom regulator.

When contacted, industry association COAI's director general Rajan Mathews said, ""TRAI is the competent authority to determine whether it (the offer unveiled by Jio) is continuation of the old tariff, a new offer or whether it complies with the regulations"".

While Finnish giant Nokia is prepped up to make a comeback in the mobile space, it is also planning to roll-out 5G connectivity in India along with Bharti Airtel and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL).

The Economic Times reports that Nokia has signed a memorandum of understandings (MoUs) with Indian telecom giants Airtel and BSNL.

Sanjay Malik, head of India market at Nokia told the paper that the idea behind these pacts is to introduce 5G in the country and see what are the steps required for the same. He said that this is more of a preparatory phase for getting into 5G.

Nokia is also setting up an experience centre within its R&D center in Bengaluru to understand stakeholder requirements for 5G in India and push towards the adoption of the new technology in the country.

5G is expected to launch in developed countries by 2020 and by 2022, in India. While the penetration of 4G in the Indian market has been tepid, there is much scepticism towards the adoption of 5G in India.

Despite the pessimistic outlook, mobile companies, telecom operators and the Centre are working towards ensuring that India comes on board the 5G bandwagon in line with the world.

From the sidelines of the World Mobile Congress, Samsung and Reliance Jio had earlier announced that they together plan to bring 5G network to India and Telecom Secretary JS Deepak had said,""We were late in 3G and 4G and we are very keen that India should not be deprived of 5G. It is not only a communication issue, it is a productivity issue for industry. It has wider applications in smart cities and grids and all kinds of things.""

Users of Airtel, Vodafone and Idea mobile services filed maximum billing complaints in October-December of 2016, as per the latest report of Trai.

The complaints in the case of Bharti Airtel mostly came from 2G pre-paid subscribers in Tamil Nadu (including Chennai), Kolkata, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, where the benchmark violation ranged between 0.11 per cent and 0.12 per cent.

According to quality of service norms, the complaint level should not be more than 0.1 per cent per 100 bills issued in one quarter.

The maximum violations are found in the case of Vodafone, where 0.15 per cent and 0.13 per cent of bills were disputed by its users in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, respectively.

Vodafone is the only company during the reported quarter whose post-paid customers in the Mumbai circle also raised a number of quality issues.

Complaints against Idea in the north-east telecom circle pertained to 0.13 per cent of disputed bills.

As for other quality parameters, Trai found performance of Aircel below par for call drops in most telecom circles.

Trai has set a penalty of up to Rs 2 lakh for poor mobile service, including call drops. The penalty kicks in for more than 2 per cent call drops in a quarter in one telecom circle.

According to the report, Aircel's 2G network crossed this limit in four circles. The call drop rate on the Aircel network was as high as 27.73 in the north-east circle. Airtel, Sistema Shyam and Reliance Communications (GSM) service also overshot the call drop level in one circle each.

During the peak hour, the rate is relaxed up to 3 per cent. Even in this category, the figure remained above this level for Aircel 2G in 11 out of the 22 telecom circles.

State-owned BSNL, Tata Teleservices (CDMA) and Vodafone also failed on the 3 per cent parameter in one circle each. Telenor's performance was found below par in Bihar and UP East circle, as per the report.

RCom topped the list of offenders in the deposits refund category, followed by Tata Teleservices. As per Trai rules, a telecom operator should refund 100 per cent of the claimed deposit within 60 days, but RCom, including its subsidiary, breached this norm across 20 circles in the country.

TTSL did not comply with the deposit rule in six telecom circles, according to the report."

Citing TRAI's December 2016 report, the minister said that for 2G services MTNL is meeting all the parametrise except one pertaining to percentage requests for termination and closure of services complied within seven days (whether the set benchmark is 100 per cent). Similarly, BSNL is meeting benchmarks for all parametrise except for one in West Bengal service area.

In the quarter ended December 2016, for 3G services, MTNL met the benchmark for all parametrise except one on congestion at the point of interconnect.

""Whereas Aircel is not meeting the benchmark for various parametrise in 14 licence areas,"" the minister said.

According to information shared by the minister, newcomer Reliance Jio has 94.28 per cent urban subscribers as on December 31, 2016. For Bharti, this number stood at 50.88 per cent, and in the case of Vodafone and Idea at 46.29 per cent and 45.23 per cent, respectively.

Responding to another query, Sinha said an estimated 55,000 villages in the country do not have mobile coverage.

Various schemes are being implemented with financial support from the Universal Service Obligation Fund for provision of services in commercially unviable rural and remote areas of the country.

To a separate question, the minister replied that the powers of the telecom department to impose financial penalty on various service providers for violation of terms and conditions of the licence agreement stands reinstated, with the pronouncement of an order of the Division Bench of High Court of Tripura in favour of Union of India."

Reliance Jio has extended the deadline to enrol for its Jio Prime plan till April 15, 2017. The move comes as a relief to millions of Jio customers who can enrol themselves for the service by paying a one-time fee of Rs 99 and avail of a host of benefits.

Along with the extension of the deadline, Jio continued with its streak of throwing surprises when it unveiled its latest offer known as ‘Summer Surprise’. Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries', promises this to be just the first of many surprises lined up for Jio Prime members.

Ambani in his statement said more than 72 million Jio customers have signed up for Jio Prime so far and the number is only supposed to go up further.

Here’s a brief of what the plans are and how Prime members stand to benefit.

Extension of enrolment for Prime:

Jio’s free service period is coming to an end. Jio Users as customers can enrol for Jio Prime offer by paying just Rs 99 and opting for a plan of Rs 303 or above.

‘Summer Surprise’ offer

All those who enrol before April 15 and recharge for plans of Rs 303 and more will get three months of complimentary service i.e. the company will not charge you anything till July 1, 2017 and one can continue availing benefits of its existing plan.

For example, if a user recharges with Rs 99 (enrolment into Jio Prime) and then recharges worth Rs 303, before April 15 he can avail 1GB data per day along with unlimited free calling services and SMS service.

Now instead of Rs 303, if somebody recharges worth Rs 499 he will receive 2GB data every day for free till July 1, 2017.

What will happen if you don’t enrol for Prime by April 15?

If one fails to recharge by April 15, all the free services from Jio will come to an end. Furthermore, Jio Prime members enjoy almost double data benefits when compared to non-Jio Prime members.

According to Reliance, users who do not recharge by April 15 will experience degradation and/or discontinuation of services.

What to do if the Rs 303-data plan with 1 GB daily FUP is not enough?

If 1GB free data daily on 4G speeds is not good enough you can opt for the Rs 499 Jio Prime plan which offers a daily FUP on 4G speeds of 2GB for 28 days. To get rid of the FUP altogether, users can opt for the Rs 999 Jio Prime Plan, which offers 60GB 4G data with 60 days validity without any FUP.

There are other plans for Rs 1,999, Rs 4,999 and Rs 9,999 with 90 days, 180 days and 360 days validity and 125GB, 350GB, and 750GB data respectively without any FUP.

In case, you are using a Jio Prime plan without FUP and run out of data midway, you can always opt for booster packs ranging between Rs 11 and Rs 301 with 0.1GB to 10GB data.

Fino Payments Bank will have a mix of physical and digital platforms along with a network of access points to increase reach and convenience to its customers.

Fino is the fourth player making entry into the payments bank space after the debut by telecom firm Airtel last year followed by e-wallet company Paytm.

Bharat Financial

Credit Suisse has maintained a neutral target on the stock with an unchanged target of Rs 720. The research firm cites management’s confidence of 50 percent growth in assets under management (AUM) for FY18. It believes that loan growth may be driven by 30-35 percent increase in number of borrowers.

Moreover, the appetite for the market to absorb MFI loans is high. But, Credit Suisse believes competitors converting into small banks may reduce the focus on microfinance institutions (MFIs).

Bharti Airtel

UBS has a buy call on the stock with a target of Rs 400. The research firm sees company reducing its net debt / EBITDA by 0.2 times through the Bharti Infratel deal. Moreover, it sees Airtel to be a major beneficiary from the consolidation in the sector, which is peaking.

Zee Entertainment

Credit Suisse has maintained an outperform rating on the stock with an unchanged target of Rs 625. It cites the management’s take that demonetisation will not have an impact in FY18 and sees 12-13 percent growth in advertising industry spend. The research firm believes phase three digitization should increase sub revenue over 12 months.

Information Technology

CLSA has a buy call on HCL Tech and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in IT space. It believes Q4 is likely to feature seasonal softness, but will be supported by 50-70 basis points in forex revenue. Moreover, it expects constant currency growth quarter on quarter (QoQ) on an average of 1.4 percent led by HCL Tech.

The research firm expects Infosys to report the weakest Q4, but guides to 8-10 percent constant currency for FY18. The research firm said that it would look out for signs of cyclical strength, particularly US banking.

Autos

CLSA believes PE multiples in the sector have not shown much correlation with earnings. It stated that only three companies had met or beat estimates the most in the past ten years—Motherson, Bajaj Auto and Ashok Leyland. Companies with the highest earnings predictability in the last five years are Hero, Eicher Motors and Bajaj Auto, while the ones with weakest earnings predictability are Ashok Leyland, Bharat Forge and Tata Motors."

Jio has offered a cashback of Rs 50 on applying for a Prime membership paid for via its Jio Money wallet. Another Rs 50 cashback can be availed on a recharge of Rs 303 right after opting for the membership. The cashback offer does not apply to payments made through other wallets like Paytm or MobiKwik.

The discount voucher can be redeemed only on the Jio Plan recharge for the value of Rs 303 or more using JioMoney between March 25 and June 30.

A cashback of Rs 100 would mean the Prime membership worth Rs 99 comes practically free. However, the cashback will be in the form of vouchers in the Jio Money app.

Announced in February, the Reliance Jio Prime membership was aimed at extending the benefits offered under its ‘Happy New Year’ plan, albeit with varied monthly data tariffs applicable.

By enrolling for Prime membership, open until March 31, and recharging Rs 303 per month, users get 30 GB data or 1 GB per day, along with access to a bouquet of other media services. Customers can also avail other regular postpaid and prepaid tariff plans.

A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch Survey suggests nearly 82 percent of Reliance Jio users are willing to continue with its services even after the free offers end.

Freebies offered by Jio caused a pandemonium of sorts in the Indian telecom market. A loss for Idea Cellular in the quarter gone by pushed the company into announcing a merger with Vodafone.

Major incumbent Bharti Airtel has also gone fervently scouting for opportunities to expand its foothold in the 4G space. The company Thursday announced acquisition of 4G business of Tikona Digital Networks, barely a month after a similar deal with Telenor."

The Indian market touched fresh record highs in March, but there are some stocks which global brokerage recommend investors to either sell or bring down their holding in stocks such as InterGlobe, GAIL, Idea, Bharti Airtel, and TVS Motors Company.

The market may not be able to give stellar returns from current levels but the stock-specific action is likely to continue and investors should use every dip to accumulate stocks.

If you are long-term investors then just sit tight and enjoy the ride as Nifty may well break the recent record high of 9,218 to continue its journey towards mount 11,000. But, in the short-term markets may take a breather and then head higher.

A good portfolio strategy involves getting rid of those stocks which are unlikely to deliver a return in the medium to long term. Hence, investors should use any rally to either exit their positions or pare their holdings in select stocks.

We have collated a list of top five stocks where global brokerage firms such as CLSA, UBS, Deutsche Bank in a separate note to their clients in March either maintained sell or underperform rating.

InterGlobe Aviation: SELL| Target Rs 750

UBS maintains a sell call on InterGlobe Aviation with a 12-month target price of Rs 750. The pricing is weaker than needed compared to the demand outlook. However, the management believes that it is a temporary business factor.

Rising fuel cost remains a potential catalyst towards higher yield, UBS said in a report. Indigo yields have seen bigger hit given higher exposure to the metro route.

Although the aircraft mix capacity growth is likely to remain strong, but management expects to pay out a large portion of net profits as dividends.

Bharti Airtel: Underperform | Target Rs 380

CLSA downgraded Bharti Airtel to underperform from buy earlier and has also slashed its 12-month target price to Rs 380 from Rs 393 earlier.

Bharti Airtel’s Rs 345 offer of unlimited voice and 1GB data/day blunts Jio's value proposition. It is worth noting that, Airtel's new offer will limit churn, but will dilute ARPU, said the CLSA report.

The global investment bank lowered FY18-19CL revenue by 10 percent and EBITDA by 17-19 percent to factor in ARPU dilution. But, reduction in dual-SIM's, as well as sector consolidation at a fast pace could provide upside, said the CLSA note.

TVS Motor Company: SELL | Target Rs 305

Deutsche Bank maintains a sell rating on TVS Motor Company with a 12-month target price of Rs 305. The management is confident that strengthened product portfolio will drive margins, but the global investment bank expects the pace of market share gains to slow due to higher competitive intensity.

The global investment bank believes that current price-earnings multiple of 31x FY18E and 24x FY19E reflect adverse risk-reward. “Margins will improve only if it is able to garner strong leadership position,” said the Deutsche Bank report.

Idea Cellular: SELL | Target Rs 90

CLSA maintains a sell rating on Idea Cellular but slashed its 12-month target price to Rs 90 from Rs 100 earlier. Idea and Vodafone announced their merger earlier this week which will change the industry order.

Post-merger, while AB Group and Vodafone Plc will hold 26% and 45% stakes in the merged company, they will have the same voting rights and board representation.

Realisation of management’s expected merger synergies of Rs140bn from FY23 will be crucial in lowering its net debt/Ebitda ratio to a comfortable 3.0x.

“We lower our revenue and Ebitda forecasts by 2%-27% on the back of rising competition and lower our target price from Rs100 to Rs90/share,” said the CLSA report.

GAIL India: SELL | Target Rs 347

Citigroup maintains sell rating on GAIL India with a 12-month target price of Rs 347. GAIL's LPG segment has benefited in 2HFY17 from higher realisations and lower domestic gas prices.

Petchem too has gained from stabilisation and ramp-up of Pata II. However, further upside in both could be capped, said the Citigroup note.

“We forecast FY19E EBITDA/PAT for GAIL to decline 5%/7% driven by LNG trading (US contracts) and petchem,” it said. “We are concerned the market is pricing GAIL on peak earnings,” said the note.

If train journeys were boring for you, Indian Railways will spice it up. It is planning to offer TV shows, movies and songs for the entertainment of its passengers, reports Business Standard.

Entertainment on train journeys is usually limited to activities such as card games and talking to fellow passengers. With Railways planning bringing TV on our phones, train travel, especially long-distance, is about to get more exciting.

In an effort to revamp railways, the Ministry may invite bids for Content on Demand (CoD) and rail radio services in April. Services that are included under the CoD initiative are TV serials, movies, short videos, kids’ shows and devotional content; streaming audio such as movie songs, regional songs, and devotional music; and providing electronic newspapers, gaming and educational content.

This is part of Railways’ non-fare revenue policy, which also saw the sector coming up with ideas like holding weddings at stations or giving branding rights of trains and stations to fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies.

Content on demand on trains and at stations is a sizeable market, says a report by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). And, Railways estimates the infotainment market to be around Rs 2,277 crore in three years’ time.

Which interested players?

Content owners like Eros Entertainment, Balaji Productions and Shemaroo Entertainment, and content aggregators like Radio Mirchi, Fever FM, Hungama and Bindass.

Telecom firms like Vodafone, Idea Cellular and Airtel.

Internet service providers and players in the offline streaming market including PressPlay TV, Moving Talkies, Dwingloo, Fropcorn, TouringTalkies, MyFreeTV, Zonk and CloudPlay.

Action plan

Companies that win the bid will be awarded contracts for 10 years and it will be for sectors including radio, video, digital music and digital gaming.

The course of the plan will be to rollout CoD and rail radio on 30 percent of the trains in the first year. In the second year, 60 percent of the trains will enjoy these facilities. By the end of the third year, all trains will be equipped with these services.

Cost of content

To keep its passengers entertained, Railways will have to bear the cost. Is too much? As per the BCG report, to provide offline content the sector will have to shell out RS 38,000 for each coach. But, the online content will be expensive. Railways will have to spend Rs 25 lakh for each coach to be well equipped to offer content streamed via the internet.

A non-fare revenue evaluation committee will also be setup to overlook the projects.

Getting a new look

For a long time, Indian Railways has been recognising its losses but now the sector on wheels is on a mission to reduce the book on debts. Passenger fares have been pinching the pockets of the national transporter. As per media reports, Railways incurred losses of Rs 33,821.70 crore on passenger fares and for addition of extra coaches during 2014-15.

For a financial turnaround the business, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu and his team is leaving no stone unturned. In a latest development, it has also signed an agreement with a Railway research centre in Australia. This partnership will help Indian railways to adopt international models and advance both in Indian and globally."
"February 28, 2017 08:22 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/will-offer-viewsspectrum-auction-when-govt-asks-trai-1033903.html,"Regulator TRAI on Tuesday said it will be ""happy"" to give its recommendations to the government on spectrum auctions, including timing and pricing aspects, as and when the matter is referred to it.

TRAI Chairman RS Sharma told PTI that although he would not make any specific comments on the timing of auction, the telecom regulator has generally been of the view that the earlier spectrum is leveraged and utilised ""the better it is"".

The comments assume significance as earlier today the Telecom Department has advocated annual spectrum auctions for India's telecom market and has said it will shortly approach TRAI for recommendations on pricing, timing and bands that should be placed on the block.

The Telecom Department has also said that the next auction could be held between July and December this year, and will be preceded by a comprehensive policy on use of various spectrum bands including backhaul, access and 5G spectrum.

""Telecom Department is certainly within its rights to ask us to provide recommendations and we will be doing that... Our view in the past also has been to ensure auction of the entire spectrum (placed on the block) and that view was fortunately accepted by the DoT,"" he said.

Sharma further said: ""Broadly, our view is that spectrum is a resource that is a perishable resource... so the longer you don't use it, you are losing in an irreversible manner...

you cannot recover that lost value. Essentially, the earlier it is leveraged and utilised, the better it is,"" Sharma said.

He was speaking on the sidelines of Mobile World Congress here.

Asked if the regulator, like DoT, was also of the view that auctions should be held this year, Sharma declined to make specific comment but indicated that not utilising spectrum is akin to losing it.

""No, I won't like to comment on the timing. But when the Telecom Department asks us for our advise whether on timing or prices, we will be happy to give it. We have given certain recommendations with regard to V Band and E Band that we will continue to pursue it with the DoT too. Again, we must realise that not using spectrum, is losing it,"" Sharma said.

On Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal and DoT Secretary JS Deepak speaking out in favour of consolidation in the Indian telecom market, Sharma declined to comment saying these were business decisions.

""I have not given any comments on that issue in the past and I will refrain from doing so now. Because these are business decisions... I have maintained that as and when there are regulatory issues that are brought to our notice, we will be dealing with them. But upfront I have no observations to make,"" he said."
"February 28, 2017 09:39 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/have-few-solid-operators-encourage-consolidation-mittal-1034184.html,"Most regulators still live in ""analogue world"", India's telecom tycoon Sunil Bharti Mittal said today, nudging them to allow consolidation while underlining that a large number of operators does not ensure greater competition.

Large countries only need three service providers while smaller nations could be covered by two carriers, he said.

The comments come days after his company, Bharti Airtel announced acquisition of Norwegian company Telenor's India unit. Also, its smaller rivals Vodafone and Idea Cellular are considering merging.

""Governments have got it wrong for too long. Regulators have always felt giving out new licences means more money for the government and more competition for the customers. It's quite the contrary,"" he said delivering a keynote address at the Mobile World Congress here.

The Airtel Chairman said one doesn't want a situation where there are one or two ""healthy"" operators, while another similar number struggle while other ""three or four are in the ICU"".

""You really want a few sustainable solid operators, who can put out the investments that are required to deal with the new technologies, demand of data, the speeds that you want.

It's extremely important that the regulators re-calibrate demand,"" he said.

Mittal cited examples from the US and Europe and said these issues are of concern to the telecom industry globally.

""In Africa, again and again when I meet regulators and ministers, they talk about issuing new licences. The time for a licence and 500,000 base stations creating a value is over.

You can give as many licences as you want but please allow consolidation,"" he urged.

He expressed delight that Indian government is comfortable with the country having five operators now, from 12 a few years ago.

""Probably it will be down to 4, let's see where it ends up,"" he said.

Telecom Secretary JS Deepak had said yesterday that the fresh round of consolidation unfolding in the Indian telecom market is likely to yield five major players ensuring ""enough competition but not fragmentation of spectrum"".

Most competition and communications regulators still live in an ""analogue world"", Mittal said, adding that they need to realise that more operators does not mean more competition.

""My opinion to all regulators around the globe is have few solid operators and encourage consolidation,"" he said, adding, it is important that players get a reasonable return on their investments."

Investors cheered Bharti’s decision to acquire Telenor India as the stock surged 10 percent intraday on Thursday. The stock contributed heavily to the index’s gain for a greater part of the trading session and pushed up the market on expiry day. While the company did not disclose the deal value, said to be under finalisation, sources told CNBC-TV18 that the acquisition cost could be to the tune of Rs 6,000-7,000 crore. Analysts pegged the deal to be valuable for Airtel on the back of multiple benefits. However, they have also flagged concerns on the sector’s outlook based on increased competition. Numbers SpeakMotilal Oswal has a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 410. It estimates an investment of Rs 2,000 crore by Bharti to acquire outstanding spectrum payments and other operational contracts including tower lease. Based on this investment, “the deal appears attractive, with a possible EV/EBITDA of 5-6X on current EBITDA run rate.” It estimates Telenor's EBITDA to improve to Rs 60-70 crore, assuming a margin of 25-27 percent compared to Bharti’s 38 percent India wireless margin. With Bharti’s investment likely to be at Rs 2,000 crore, the deal would be RoCE-accretive and would yield 20 percent RoCE, the brokerage said. Fitch, on its part, expects Bharti's EBITDA for the financial year to March 2017 (FY17) to be around USD 5-5.3 billion (FY16: USD 5 billion) despite intense competition in the Indian mobile market during second half of this financial year. On the debt front, Motilal Oswal said, “With an operating cash flow of Rs 32,000 crore, net debt of Rs 1,02,000 crore, the investment would add hardly 2 percent to net debt, which would be offset by the EBITDA contribution from the merger.” The firm also foresaw a better roll-out of 4G services on 1800 MHz which remains the most efficient due to its well-developed ecosystem. Deutsche Bank maintains its buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 400. It feels that Telenor’s spectrum liability would account for a large part of the acquisition cost. “Adjusting for the upfront payment, the license-fee set-off and the annual payments made to date, we estimate Telenor’s outstanding spectrum liability would be around Rs 1,600 crore (USD 230 million). This would transfer to Bharti in the event of the acquisition.” However, Fitch felt that Bharti’s credit profile would remain unaffected as benefits from additional spectrum assets will offset spectrum liabilities taken over. Spectrum Needs & User BaseICICI Securities maintains its buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 410 based on better prospects as well as no extra spectrum needs. The brokerage feels that the telecom firm could further cement its position in the telecom space with a combined subscriber base of 31 crore. It remains a preferred choice owing to the superior operating metrics, analysts at the firm wrote. Deutsche Bank said that Bharti could ascribe some value to Telenor’s subscriber base, especially in two key markets of Uttar Pradesh (East) and Uttar Pradesh (West). BNP too concurred with this view and said that Airtel would be strengthened in markets such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, UP East and UP West. On spectrum requirements, ICICI Securities said, “Airtel possesses extensive spectrum coverage across circles with 942.9 MHZ of total spectrum (pre-deal), 24.1 percent of the total spectrum in the industry (ex- BSNL/MTNL, pre-deal) and would not have any spectrum requirement in the near term.” Competitiveness & ChallengesMotilal Oswal feels that the added spectrum will help Airtel to stand up to Reliance Jio’s aggressive plans. “While the incremental spectrum may not be presently required, given the large-scale data traffic on RJio’s network, holding high quantum of spectrum would allow Bharti to compete with RJio in a fixed-cost-driven market. We believe Bharti’s strategy to remain ahead of the curve in data-rich spectrum investments should hold it in good stead,” the brokerage said. Fitch, meanwhile, believed that the consolidation was taking places to take on Reliance Jio. “The agreement by Bharti Airtel to buy Telenor's Indian telecom operations is the latest sign that the entry of aggressive new operator Reliance Jio is spurring incumbents to consolidate to better meet the intense competition and weaker telecom companies to exit altogether.” Furthermore, it believes that the consolidation is not likely to return any pricing power to operators in the near term.Edelweiss has a hold call on the stock with a target price of Rs 340. The brokerage sees competitive intensity to be high despite a cut in the number of players in the space. This, it says, would be based on operators’ aim to acquire higher market share and would look to cut prices. Others could also follow suit with this.(Disclosure: Reliance Industries, the parent company of Reliance Jio, owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com.)"

The country’s telecom regulator is unlikely to budge on its earlier recommendation that a combined penalty of Rs 3,050 crore be levied on Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular for denying sufficient points of interconnect to new entrant Reliance Jio Infocomm, according to a report in The Financial Express.

On Wednesday, CNBC-TV18 had reported that the Department of Telcommunications (DoT) was of the opinion that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India had based its recommendation on “weak grounds”.TRAI has 15 days to respond to DoT's queries. If the regulator stands its ground, then the final decision of imposing the fine will have to be taken by the DoT.

In October, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India had recommended that DoT take action against the three carriers for violating licence norms. The regulator contended the carriers’ actions appeared to be aimed at stifling competition and were against public interest.

The action came after the regulator had issued showcause notices to three companies, seeking explanations for excessive call drops witnessed for calls between Jio and other networks.

But sources in DoT said that Trai did not warn the telecom companies of the high penalty while issuing the showcause notices. DoT had also questioned whether TRAI had jumped the gun by basing its calculations on a five-day period instead of the 90-day period required under law to compute data on congestion.Sources in TRAI claim that the regulator did due diligence on the matter and was within its right to recommend such a penalty as consumers were suffering, adding that Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi had concurred with this reasoning.

Idea Cellular had moved the Delhi High Court in December, challenging Trai's decision. It claimed it had complied with and met the requirements of Jio for points of interconnections. Vodafone India had also approached the same court and asked it to quash the recommendation, arguing that Trai’s move was against principles of natural justice."

India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) today kicked off its operations by rolling out pilot services in Raipur and Ranchi.

The bank will offer an interest rate of 4.5 percent on deposits up to Rs 25,000; 5 percent on deposits of Rs 25,000-50,000 and 5.5 percent on Rs 50,000-1,00,000, its Chief Executive Officer A P Singh said.

The paid up equity of the new bank is Rs 800 crore, of which the government has already infused Rs 275 crore, he added.

""The idea is to have a branch in every district and make 3 lakh postmen come alive in payment bank function,"" he said.

Also 1,000 ATMs of India Post will be transferred to IPPB, Singh added.

Telecom Minister Manoj Sinha said that IPPB plans to have 650 branches across the country by September 2017.

Terming IPPB as a mechanism for financial inclusion and a milestone, Sinha said the payments bank -- the third one to get a permit after Airtel and Paytm and the first one promoted by the government -- will not just conduct business but also serve people.

India Post Payments Bank is the third entity to receive payments bank permit after Airtel and Paytm. Payments banks can accept deposits up to Rs 1 lakh per account from individuals and small businesses.

The new model of banking allows mobile firms, super market chains and others to cater to banking requirements of individuals and small businesses. It will be set up as a differentiated bank and will confine its activities to acceptance of demand deposits, remittance services, Internet banking and other specified services.

In 2015, RBI had granted 'in-principle' approval to 11 entities, including the Department of Posts, to set up payments banks and proposed to give such licences 'on tap' basis in future.

However, a consortium of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries promoter Dilip Shanghvi, IDFC Bank and Telenor Financial Services gave up their plans to roll out payments bank.

Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company Ltd (Chola) also decided to withdraw its plans to set up a payments bank.

Tech Mahindra was the third to drop plans to roll out payments bank.

Out of the remaining eight companies in the fray, Airtel launched its commercial operation across India with an investment of Rs 3,000 crore and is offering interest rate of 7.25 percent on deposits, free money transfer from Airtel to Airtel numbers within Airtel Bank, money transfer to any bank account in the country.

Paytm, promoted by Vijay Shekhar Sharma and backed by Chinese e-commerce major Alibaba, plans to roll out payments bank with an initial investment of about Rs 400 crore.

Other players are -- Aditya Birla Nuvo, Fino PayTech, National Securities Depository, Reliance Industries and Vodafonem-pesa."

Paytm today said it has received final approval of the Reserve Bank to formally launch its payments bank and it expects to start operations next month.

Payments banks can accept deposits from individuals and small businesses up to Rs 1 lakh per account.

""Today, Reserve Bank of India gave permission to formally launch Paytm Payments Bank. We can't wait to bring it in front of you,"" Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of One97 Communications, said in a blogpost.

""No other role or responsibility means as much to me as the privilege of building Paytm Payments Bank, and I intend to take a full-time executive role in the Bank,"" Sharma said further.

He added that at Paytm Payments Bank, the aim is to build a new business model in banking industry, focussed on bringing financial services to hundreds of millions of unserved or underserved Indians.

When contacted, a Paytm spokesperson said the company hopes to launch operations in February with the first branch coming up in Noida, Uttar Pradesh.

Paytm was earlier slated to begin operations around Diwali last year. In 2015, RBI had awarded 'in-principle' approval to Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of One97 Communications, to set up a Payments Bank along with 10 others.

With the objective of deepening financial inclusion, RBI kicked off an era of differentiated banking by allowing SFBs (small finance banks) and PBs (payments banks) to start services. A total of 21 entities were given in-principle nod last year, including 11 for payments banks.

Later, three entities -- Tech Mahindra, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company and a consortium of Dilip Shanghvi, IDFC Bank and Telenor Financial Services -- backed out of the payments bank licensing.

Currently, Airtel is the only player that has commenced Payments Bank operations. Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank is expected to launch services in the first half of 2017.

Sharma will hold the majority share in Paytm Payments Bank, with the rest being held by One97 Communications.

Last month, One97 Communications had restructured its business ahead of the launch of the Payments Bank, merging the wallet business with payments bank operation.

Alibaba Group and its affiliate Ant Financial pumped in USD 680 million into Paytm's parent One97 Communications last year, taking its total shareholding to over 40 percent in the country's largest mobile wallet operator, Paytm.

However, the Chinese entity will not have a direct shareholding in the payments bank."

After Rajasthan, Airtel Payments Bank has now rolled out pilot services in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

""In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Airtel Payments Bank is rolling out pilot services across 8,000 Airtel retail outlets in Andhra Pradesh and 7,000 outlets in Telangana, which also acts as banking points,"" it said in a statement.

This follows the pilot rollout in Rajasthan, where over 1 lakh customers opened savings accounts in less than two weeks of commencement of services, it added.

Airtel Payments Bank is the first payments bank in India to go live.

Customers opening a savings account with Airtel Payments Bank will get one minute of Airtel mobile talk time for every rupee deposited.

For example, if a customer opens an account with a deposit of Rs 500, then he/she will get 500 minutes of free talk time for calls to anywhere in India on his/her Airtel mobile number.

""We are pleased to rollout our pilot services in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and look forward to serving customers and contributing the financial inclusion vision of the two states,"" Airtel Payments Bank MD and CEO Shashi Arora said.

Airtel Payments Bank plans to develop a nationwide merchant ecosystem of over three million partners that will include small kirana stores, small shops and restaurants.

These merchant partners will accept digital payments for goods and services from Airtel Payments Bank customers over mobile phones.

Airtel Payments Bank said it will not charge any processing fee from merchants and this facility would be free for customers as well as merchants.

Cellular operators' association COAI has expressed disappointment over the Rs 3,050 crore penalty recommended by Trai on incumbent operatorsAirtel, Vodafone and Idea for allegedly denying interconnectivity to newcomer Reliance Jio.

But the association - which at one point, had led cellular operators from the front in their battle with the new entrant over call connectivity - said it will not get involved as interconnect issue was a matter involving individual operators and bilateral agreements.

""We are disappointed when large penalties are recommended or imposed on the industry...it is not a trivial amount...it seems that Trai has imposed maximum penalty of Rs 50 crore (per circle),"" COAI Director General Rajan Mathews told PTI.

However, Department of Telecom (DOT) will decide whether the same is appropriate or not, he said.

""The matter is between individual operators and Trai. We were not privy to the showcase notice by Trai or subsequent responses. We were not involved with details of the matter...it is bilateral...we will wait to see DOT's response on the matter...DOT will have to review and decide,"" he added.

Asked if the association will chalk out a future course of action to represent the stance of the incumbent telcos on the issue of interconnect and penalty, Mathews emphasised that operators will decide on how they want to respond.

In a setback to incumbent telecom operators, the telecom regulator on Friday suggested a penalty of about Rs 1,050 crore each for Airtel and Vodafone, and Rs 950 crore in case of Idea Cellular.

Trai in its recommendation to DOT, said it has found the trio to be non-compliant with licence conditions and service quality norms given the high rate of call failures and congestion at interconnect points for RJio.

It also noted that denial of interconnection by these operators to RJio ""appears to be with the ulterior motive to stifle competition and is anti-consumer"".

The regulator stopped short of recommending cancellation of their licences saying it may lead to ""significant consumer inconvenience"". The recommendation came on a complaint by Reliance Jio that over 75 per cent of the calls on its network are failing as incumbents were not giving sufficient points of interconnect that would help complete calls.(Disclosure: Reliance Jio is part of Reliance Industries which owns Network18 Media and moneycontrol.com)"

Taking its fight against incumbent telecom operators to the next level, Reliance Jio today made live the data on call drops its users are experiencing due to Airtel, Vodafone and Idea not providing enough interconnectivity.

The Mukesh Ambani-run firm added a link on its website detailing call drops experienced during a 24-hour duration.

In doing so, Jio has carried out the threat it had issued in a statement earlier this month of reporting operator-wise call failure numbers ""in the spirit of putting the customer-first and complete transparency."" Jio today put out data for September 22 saying over 12 crore out of 15 crore call attempts by its users failed.

The data would be updated periodically.

Of the 6.13 crore call attempts made to Airtel network on September 22, 4.8 crore or 78.4 per cent failed. The failure on Vodafone network was higher at 84.1 per cent with 3.95 crore out of 4.69 crore calls failing while 3.36 crore out of 4.39 crore calls made to Idea users failed.

The company said 81.5 per cent out of 0.43 crore calls made to Airtel network during busy hours failed while 87.8 per cent out of 0.26 crore calls to Vodafone dropped. Of the 0.28 crore calls made to Idea network during busy hours, 82.2 per cent failed.

The data which has now been made live by Reliance Jio comes at a time when a fierce corporate battle is raging, within the Indian telecom sector over the interconnect issue.

Jio, the new entrant in the 4G market, has accused dominant incumbent operators, including Airtel, of providing far less than adequate points of interconnections (PoIs) needed for its users to complete a call to a rival network, while the operators have charged the new entrant of unleashing a ""tsunami"" of free traffic on their networks.

Inter-connection enables mobile users to make calls to customers of other telecom networks and is, therefore, crucial for smooth functioning of mobile service.

Jio argues that benefits of superior voice technology is being denied to its customers due to the network congestion and has blamed the ""anti-competitive behaviour of incumbent operators"" for the ""poor experience"" on its services.

Sector regulator TRAI, which had asked the operators to submit their network congestion details from September 15-19, 2016, to examine the congestion issue, has now decided to issue showcause notices on erring operators for call drops far exceeding the norm.(Reliance Jio is part of Reliance Industries which also owns Network18 and moneycontrol.com)"

Against a requirement of 4,000 to 5,000 points of interconnect per operator, the interconnections released are less than 2,000 by Airtel, about 1,500 by Vodafone and close to 1,600 by Idea, Reliance Jio said in a statement said.

""Despite repeated reminders and bilateral meetings with incumbent operators and claims made by them, hardly any new interconnection capacity has been made operational by any of the three incumbent operators, viz. Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India or Idea Cellular for Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) in the last 15 days,"" it said.

It said its immediate requirement of operational interconnection capacity based on transparent industry practice is of the order of 4,000-5,000 E1s per operator for the three incumbent operators.

""It is therefore apparent that at the current rate, the incumbent operators have not demonstrated any real intent to resolve this issue,"" the company said. ""With over 10 crore call failures per day between RJIL and the three incumbent operators, this has resulted in severe quality of service issues for the Indian customers."" The call failure rate, it said, has been worsening rapidly in the last few days, while augmentation of interconnection capacity is still awaited.

""The continued denial of requisite PoI's is in clear violation of the license conditions and TRAI regulations on quality of service by the incumbent operators.

""The deliberate move to not provide sufficient interconnection capacity ... is clearly aimed at hindering RJIL's entry into the sector and is depriving Indian customers from enjoying superior HD voice services being offered by RJIL,"" the statement said.

Stating that there have been press releases and media statements by some of the incumbent operators about positive intent to augment interconnection capacity in the last few days, it said this has not been followed with action.

""Considering the current working E1s, including the proposed augmentation by the incumbent operators, would still be far lesser than what is required to meet QoS parameters, more concrete action is warranted from the incumbent operators,"" the company said.

RJIL hoped that the incumbent operators would enhance the PoI's sufficiently to meet their license obligation of quality of service (QoS) with immediate effect and maintain these parameters on an ongoing basis.Disclaimer: Reliance Industries, which owns Reliance Jio, also owns Network18, which publishes Moneycontrol.com."

Aircel has entered into an agreement with Bharti Airtel to sell its 4G spectrum in eight circles for Rs 3,500 crore.

Besides, the company and RCom are in talks to merge their mobile business into a combined entity with 19.3 per cent of total spectrum allocated to the industry - the highest in the country by an entity.

In a letter to the CBI and Enforcement Directorate, Bhushan said, ""It is strange and disturbing that while properties of former telecom minister and Sun Direct TV are being attached, but the assets of Aircel/Maxis in India have not been attached.

""This has happened despite the fact that Maxis and its owner have evaded summons issued by the Special Court and have not appeared before the Court."" He asked both the agencies to freeze spectrum of Aircel.

When contacted, Bharti Airtel declined to comment, while queries sent to Aircel RCom remained unanswered.

In the letter, Bhushan said, ""If the deal between Aircel and Bharti Airtel and the deal between Aircel and Reliance Communications (RCom) is allowed to go through, then that would allow Maxis to escape the arm of law and abscond with thousands of crores of money. Spectrum is the real asset held by Aircel and the same needs to be attached immediately."" ""When action has been taken against former minister Dayanidhi Maran, another accused in the case, why no action is taken against Ananda Krishnan and Maxis,"" he said.

The CBI has filed a detailed chargesheet against Aircel/Maxis, its Malaysian owner Ananda Krishnan and ED has also filed cases against them. ED has also attached properties of the former telecom minister, the letter said.

Malaysia-based Maxis Communications holds 74 per cent equity stake in Aircel while the rest 26 per cent is with Sindya Securities and Investments Ltd.

In August 2014, CBI filed chargesheet in the 2G special court alleging that Dayanidhi Maran had entered into a criminal conspiracy with T Ananda Krishnan, and coerced the original promoter of Aircel to sell his shares to Ananda Krishnan in lieu of investments by Maxis Group into Sun Direct TV (owned by Maran brothers).

The chargesheet has been filed against Dayanidhi Maran, Kalanidhi Maran, T Ananda Krishnan, Ralph Marshall (executive of the Maxis Group), and four firms - Maxis Communication Berhad, Astro All Asia Network PLC, Sun Direct TV Pvt. Ltd., South Asia Entertainment Holdings, Mauritius.

Bhushan cited various occasions when courts issued summons to Krishnan, Ralph Marshall, Maxis Communications Berhad, and Astro All Asia Network PLC but they did not comply with the court orders.

""For a telecom operating company, spectrum is the main asset. Maxis should not be allowed to sell spectrum and equity unless all the accused - Ananda Krishnan, and the firm Maxis comply with summons issued by the 2G special court,"" Bhushan said."

""Other than Airtel & Vodafone in 2G, all operators failed to meet the Call Drop Rate benchmark,"" the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) said in a report released on June 13.

Airtel too failed to meet the 2 percent call drop benchmark for its 3G network.

The 2 percent call drop benchmark means that not more than 2 percent calls made from a network should automatically disconnected in a telecom circle.

The regulator found call drop as high as 22.2 percent on state-run BSNL's 3G network in Bhopal.

""Idea, Reliance & BSNL all have Call Drop Rates in the range of 10 percent or above. These are exceptionally high and clearly indicate urgent need for improvement in order to deliver reasonable levels of service,"" the report said.

TRAI also found Airtel, BSNL and Videocon Telecom using high level of Radio Link Timeout technology, which has been alleged being used for masking call drops, but said that the high parameters did not impact consumer experience in a substantial manner.

""Radio Link Timeout (RLT indicates how long the call can sustain during poor quality. Higher the value the longer it will sustain the call). Airtel, BSNL and Videocon have set higher RLT Values. However, as the adjoining table shows, the impact of RLT in the Call Drop Rate is minimal in Bhopal,"" TRAI said.

""While the area of Delhi NCR is 46,208 kilometer square, these results are limited to a route covering 600 km only.

Hence the QoS results from the Drive Test are not strictly comparable with the standard QoS for Dropped Calls regularly published by TRAI for the entire service area,"" COAI said in a statement.

The Cellular Operators Association of India represents telecom majors, including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular, Aircel etc.

The drive test and its results do not cover all the cell sites but only a limited amount of the telecom circle, it said.

Trai published its report on drive tests of mobile service quality and found that ""all 3G networks; 2G networks of Airtel and MTNL and CDMA network of Relaince Communication have shown degradation in performance compared to previous drive test"".

In the latest tests conducted in Delhi, state-run telecom operator MTNL failed on all network-based quality of service parameters.

However, COAI has contested the same and said, ""When we look at the QoS for the whole LSA of Delhi we notice that all the operators are in compliance with the benchmark set by TRAI of 2 percent. Given the limited coverage of these Drive Tests, the results show problems limited to the known problematic areas where the industry faces issues in obtaining cell sites."" The industry body also called report on using radio link time out technology being used for masking dropped call as misleading but did not contest finding of Trai report that telecom operator Aircel is using it beyond the levels being used by its peers.

""It is also interesting to note that the big headlines regarding masking of call drops using the RLT ( Radio Link Timeout) parameter proved misleading as TRAI's own published results in the Drive Tests show only one operator out of parameter,"" COAI said.

As per Trai report for Delhi, Aircel and Vodafone have been using RLT beyond levels that their peers follow.

RLT is one of the parameters, which decides for how long the call should be sustained if the signal quality drops below a certain threshold. As per an official source, that some teleom operators are using it for masking call drops resulting in higher bills for telecom subscribers.

COAI said tat Trai report shows majority of the call drops happening in the four areas of Central Delhi, Dwarka & IGI Airport, Gurgaon & Manesar and Noida & Mayur Vihar."

IT firm Tech Mahindra on May 24 said it will not pursue its plans to set up payments bank operations in the country, becoming the third player to pull out from the race.

""With reference to the earlier communication dated August 20, 2015, about the in-principle approval granted by RBI for setting up a payments bank, Board of Directors of the company have decided that the company will not pursue this opportunity,"" it said in a filing to the BSE.

Sun Pharma founder Dilip Shanghvi who along with IDFC Bank and Telenor got in-principle approval from the Reserve Bank for payments bank, also pulled out of the race last week. A couple of months back, Cholamandalam group also dropped plans of setting up a payments bank.

""It was a conscious decision that we wanted to be in this business. We still strongly believe that it is a very large unserved market. Over a period of time, we realised amount of aggression that has come to the marketplace which only erodes the margin because it was anyway more about transactions and the volume of transactions with a razor thin margins,"" C P Gurnani, Managing Director and CEO of Tech Mahindra said when asked about the reason for backing out from the race.

""We realised that the business profitability will take a much longer period than what we were willing to invest into and that is the reason,"" he added.

Alibaba-backed Paytm, Reliance Industries and Airtel would have been Tech Mahindra's major competitors.

Last August, RBI gave in-principle approval to 11 applicants including Department of Posts, Aditya Birla Nuvo, Airtel M Commerce Services, Fino PayTech, National Securities Depository, Reliance Industries, Tech Mahindra and Vodafone m-pesa for setting up payments banks.

Gurnani further said both Tech Mahindra and its partner Mahindra Finance had come to the conclusion that ""the payback could be much longer"".

RBI deputy governor S S Mundra had expressed displeasure over in-principle licensees cancelling their plan to set up payments bank.

""We would certainly feel little aggrieved because lot of efforts from the part of RBI go in processing these applications,"" Mundra has said.

RBI's in-principle approval is valid for a period of 18 months, during which time the applicants have to comply with the requirements under the guidelines and fulfill the other conditions as may be stipulated by the Reserve Bank.

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India in July 2014 had recommended a comprehensive plan for improving telecom services in ANI and Lakshadweep island with an outlay of about Rs 2,900 crore.

The DoT in a detailed project report prepared by state-run BSNL found two of the components, satellite capacity increase in Lakshadweep and optical fibre connectivity within ANI, suggested by the regulator are costing about double the amount computed by Trai and hence sought its view on the estimates.

Trai in its reply said the estimation of the investment required was done by the it on the basis of costs data inputs provided by the telecom operators including BSNL and based on certain valid assumptions.

""The authority does not have any other source to examine the item-wise costs mentioned in the DPR. Moreover, preparing or vetting Detailed Project Report is not a function of TRAI.

It is for DoT to take a decision on the matter,"" Trai said.

The regulator said it has been almost 20 months since the recommendations were made in July 2014 and costs and need for replacement of infrastructure may vary with time.

Trai in its recommendation laid primary importance of connecting these islands through undersea cable which is dependent on connectivity from satellite only for telecom services.

The regulator said decision about the cost of project based on factors such as the availability and suitability of existing telecom infrastructure, their residual life etc can be taken by DoT.

""Keeping in view that the broad objectives outlined by the Authority in its recommendations on the Comprehensive Telecom Plan of ANI and Lakshadweep are fulfilled even if the estimated costs of the project(s) is somewhat more than the costs estimated by the Authority,"" Trai said.

The regulator has recommended that besides connecting these regions with cables, satellite connectivity should be retained in parts of both of these union territories.

In Andaman and Nicobar Island (ANI) 29 out of 576 islands are inhabited and 90 per cent of the population lives in three islands - North, Middle and South Andaman Islands alone. In Lakshadweep, 11 out of 36 are inhabited and 10 of the inhabited islands have population above 100.

For Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the regulator has suggested connecting 22 islands, which included 18 islands with population of above 100 and four islands which have presence of police, forest camps and tourists.

For Lakshadweep, the regulator has factored connectivity at 10 inhabited villages.

The islands are a part of the West Bengal service area and Lakshadweep is a part of the Kerala circle.

In Andaman & Nicobar Islands, four telecom operators - BSNL, Airtel, Vodafone and Reliance - have launched services.

In Lakshadweep, only BSNL and Airtel (partly) have launched services.

Meanwhile, complaints received by telecom regulator Trai increased to 23,313 last year, as against 18,494 in 2014.

The minister was replying to a question if there is an increase in the number of consumers' complaints about bills, connectivity, mobile portability, harassment and so on against the mobile service providers.

""There is slight increase in consumer complaints against few mobile service providers,"" Prasad said in a written reply to Lok Sabha.

According to data shared by the minister, there is an increase in complaints received by DoT against operators like Airtel, BSNL, MTS and Videocon. However, complaints against Idea, MTNL, Reliance, Tata, Uninor and Vodafone have declined.

Complaints received by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) against all telcos, barring Tata and Uninor, have increased.

On action taken by government, Prasad said complaints received by DoT and Trai are being forwarded to concerned service providers for their resolution.

""For effective resolution of consumer complaints, Trai has laid down the standards of quality of service parameters relating to time limit for fault repair, billing complaints, refund of security deposits and rent rebate for delayed fault repair,"" he said.

Trai has been monitoring the performance of service providers against the benchmarks for these parameters through quarterly performance monitoring reports submitted by the service providers, the minister said.

""Wherever the quality of service benchmark is not met, financial disincentives are imposed so that the service providers improve their performance,"" he said.

The company will also explore option of buying or sharing airwaves for wireless services with other telecom operators under spectrum trading and sharing rule as it looks to boost its operations in India, Telenor Group President & CEO Sigve Brekke said.""The future of our Indian operations will depend on additional spectrum. There is a planned auction coming in May-June and we are going to have a pragmatic and prudent way of looking at that as an opportunity,"" Brekke said during the webcast of Telenor Group financial report. The Telecom Regulator Authority of India has recommended spectrum pricing for seven bands, including the premium 700 Mhz frequency at record base price of Rs 11,485 crore per Mhz, for the next round of auction which could fetch the government a staggering Rs 5.36 lakh crore. ""What I have seen from regulator and prices so far is that they are planning to put a lot of spectrum on auction. Prices for lower band is good too high, however price for higher band such as 2.3 Ghz is more reasonable,"" Brekke said. Trai has recommended a base price of Rs 817 crore per Mhz on pan-India basis for 2.3 Ghz band. Telenor was one of the companies that strongly advocated for auction of 700 Mhz band while leading telecom players - Airtel, Idea, Reliance Jio - suggested to defer it.

""We will look at this once the spectrum prices are decided but we are going to take very pragmatic and prudent approach. We will also look at other possibilities such as spectrum sharing and trading which is now allowed,"" Brekke said.

Average revenue per user (ARPU) of Telenor India in local currency fell by 13 per cent to Rs 88 primarily driven by lower voice consumption and the impact from reduced mobile termination rate, partly compensated by increased data usage.

""The whole is market is now turning from voice into data and that is the reason we see little pressure on ARPU however our India operations are holding up quite nicely,"" Brekke said.

""We will write to DoT by the end of next week for deferring auction of 700 Mhz band and on possible errors in calculation of price of 700 Mhz band (spectrum). Trai has fixed priced based on formula given 2012. Lot of things in the industry have changed since then,"" COAI Director General Rajan S Mathews told PTI. Leading operators had requested the regulator to defer sale of 700 MHz spectrum, saying that ecosystem for providing services in this band was not developed and sale would lead to under-utilisation of the spectrum for several years and block industry's crucial fund. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has recommended a record high base price of Rs 11,485 crore per Mhz for 700 Mhz which alone.

If all the available frequencies gets sold at Trai suggested price then it alone will yield a whopping Rs 4 lakh crore. As per Trai's paper, the cost of delivering mobile services in 700 Mhz band is approximately 70 percent lower than 2100 Mhz band, which is widely used for 3G services. The auction plan suggested by total potential revenue of Rs 5.36 lakh crore from the spectrum sale, expected to be held during May-June this year, is more than the double of gross revenues of telecom services industry.

Telecom service providers had gross revenue of Rs 2.54 lakh crore in 2014-15 financial year. Trai has used its old formula given in April 2012 spectrum price recommendation to fix price of 700 Mhz at four times of 1800 Mhz band spectrum price -- widely known as 2G spectrum. Most of telecom operators who have purchased 1800 Mhz band in 2012 or later are using it for 4G services.

Mathews said that Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) also has objections on Trai's suggestion to reduce block size in 2300 Mhz band and 2500 Mhz band to 10 Mhz while in 2010 telecom operators like Infotel Broadband (now Reliance Jio), Airtel and Aircel were allowed to buy block of 20 Mhz. ""Government should give everyone equal opportunity. Across the world 20 Mhz block is a standard so it should be same in India,"" Mathews said.

Telecom operators will also raise issue of contiguous spectrum frequency in 1800 Mhz band. ""A contiguous spectrum will not only bring value for industry but also fetch good price in auctions,"" Mathews said. While DoT has proposed to auction 21 Mhz of radiowave frequencies in 1800 Mhz band, Trai has suggested that on completion of harmonisation with Defence it can increase to 201 Mhz spectrum in the same band."

During one such visits of the World Bank and UN to the tribal areas of Chhattisgarh, he had witnessed that there were a large number of girls dropping out of school in Grade 7. A study was commissioned to find out the reasons and it was found that there were multiple reasons for the increased dropout. During their periods, girls were finding it difficult to go to the toilet because there were no separate girls toilets in schools. Second was the non-availability of clean water in schools and third was the lack of facilities for disposal of rags and pads in schools. A report was submitted to the Government of India out of which the separate girls toilets issue has been actively engaged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

During this study, it was found that girls in these backward areas used rags, gunny bags, and ash during their periods as a replacement of sanitary napkins. These dirty material being used was hazardous and in some cases cancerous to the health of these girls. Dr Jawahar Surisetti then decided to start MyBeti which would supply sanitary napkins free of cost to these girls through a network of lady teachers in government schools. The aim was to bring back these girls to schools. A major napkin manufacturing company supported this cause by supplying 10 million napkins to MyBeti. Currently, 1 lakh girls are being supplied with these napkins free of cost.

The ultimate aim of Dr Jawahar is to create an ecosystem wherein the local women self-help groups are trained to manufacture clean and hygienic napkins to cater to these local schools. These are bought by the government or district administration and supplied to local schools creating employment for these ladies and reducing costs for the government while the purpose of the girl child is solved. This is the second phase of the project.

Dr Jawahar wishes that apart from his efforts, the whole community comes forward in getting toilets for girls and clean water in schools and create a disposal system for the sanitary napkins in schools. All these efforts could bring girls in large numbers back to school with the confidence that the society is with them.

Telecom operators' response to Trai's paper on differential pricing for data services is ""vague"" and their claims with regard to level-playing field are ""irrelevant"", Member of Parliament, Rajeev Chandrasekhar has said while opposing any such move. ""This consultation is examining the issue of Differential Pricing for Data Services. At the very outset, it must be said that the vague responses and claims made by Telcos with regard to 'Level Playing Field' are irrelevant to this question and can be ignored,"" Chandrasekhar submitted to Trai in counter comments.

Trai invited public comments to firm up its views over services that lead to differential pricing of data and today was the last date for submitting counter comments on the same. Telecom operators including Airtel, Vodafone, Idea, Reliance Communications and their respective associations have supported differential pricing for data services, while Internet service providers have opposed the plan. Software Freedom Law Centre said that VoIP services or internet based calls compete with traditional telephone services, as they should, because all communications, whether characterized as ""telephone calls"" or ""data packets"" are in fact the same.

""What other commentators call ""price arbitrage"" by consumers between these services should be called ""user efforts to eliminate anti-competitive routing practices, otherwise known as ""net neutrality"", SFLC said. Chandrasekhar said telecom operators claim regarding the threat to their viability contradicts all available evidence in their quarterly financial reports which point to significant revenue growth. ""Their (telecom operators) call for Differential Pricing is with a view to ensure that they are permitted to cabalize the internet through gatekeeping.

The need for a free, open and fair internet, however must supersede this desire of telcos to misuse control, and increase profits,"" he added. Chandrasekhar said that'cabalization' of the internet causes vertical integration which would lead to telecom operators owning parts of the internet and impacting consumer choice and competition in the long term by making web-only entities unviable and unable to compete. A debate on net neutrality stirred across the country after Airtel decided to charge separately for Internet-based calls but withdrew it later after people protested.

Airtel in its comment to Trai again submitted to allow companies levy different charge on internet when it is used for making calls. ""For the growth of data service, price differentiation for data services can be allowed,"" operators have submitted."

Film content and entertainment business provider Shemaroo Entertainment plans to launch its movie premiere service 'Miniplex' on cable and online after partnering with two DTH players.Shemaroo last month tied up with direct-to-home operators (DTH) Airtel and Tata Sky to launch Miniplex and the company said it will also look at tying up with other DTH players.""DTH has now emerged as a large subscription platform. So we started initially with Airtel and then with Tata Sky, and over a period, we will make this service available to many platforms as possible, where the paid subscriber base has some scale,"" Shemaroo Entertainment Director Hiren Gada told PTI.He added that the expansion would happen in a phased manner and it would take about three to four quarters to have a wider base.""By next December we should be present on many more platforms. There are four other (DTH) players. There are cable operators, particularly in the phase I, phase II markets where the digitisation has already taken place or the cities where the process is taking place, so that is another set of people that we are looking to work with,"" he said.The company would be focusing on multi-system operators (MSOs) first as they have scale in terms of numbers and have technology back-end to support a paid platform.He further said they are considering a digital platform distribution that the Miniplex content can go through, on a paid basis.Miniplex is an ad-free movie service, where the company will premiere one movie every Friday, besides showing curated movies through the week.Miniplex will predominantly showcase Hindi movies but the company will look at some cherry-picked regional content as well, going forward.""The current thought process for Miniplex is that it is a Hindi movie service.

American tech giant Apple has the biggest share of the total 14.8 million 4G-enabled devices active across all important frequencies in the country, says a study by Nokia Networks. Among the top 15 4G models, Apple devices - iPhone and iPad - occupy the top two slots. iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 devices, which support 4G services in 1800 Mhz band, are top models with 10.46 percent and 8.9 percent shares respectively, as per the study.

In India, Airtel is providing 4G service in 1800 Mhz band frequency while other companies are yet to roll out their services. At present, telecom companies hold spectrum in 1800 Mhz band, 850 Mhz band, 2300 Mhz band that can be used for 4G services in India. As per the study, Nokia Networks sees potential for providing using 2100 Mhz band for 4G services which is at present being used for 3G services.

""LTE (4G) device penetration is still low at 1.61 percent. 1800 Mhz enabled LTE devices leads with 1.45 percent (13.3 million) followed by 2100 Mhz enabled devices at 1.2 percent,"" the report said. Airtel has highest number of circles with 3G spectrum.

The study shows that the number of 4G enabled devices in 2100 Mhz or 3G band connected to network is more compared to number of devices available for 4G service in 2300 Mhz band -- the band opted by Reliance Jio Infocomm to foray into the telecom business. iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 models have highest share of 18.12 percent and 15.42 percent respectively among connected devices that can support 4G services 850 Mhz band, says the study. Reliance Communications and RJIL are planning to jointly roll out 4G services using 850 Mhz band spectrum.

Though Apple leads the segment of active 4G devices, the study also found that six out of top 10 devices in 1800 Mhz are priced below Rs 8,000. Lenovo A6000 follows iPhones among connected devices in 1800 Mhz band with 7.5 percent share. It is again followed by Apple's iPhone 5 which has 5.78 percent share.

Xiaomi's RedmiNote 3 and Micromax Yu Yureka are at 5th and 6th spot among devices in 1800 Mhz band, as per the study. Samsung Galaxy A5 follows iPhones at 4th spot among top 15 devices capable of supporting 4G services.

According to the weekly data submitted by operators, at the end of August 30 there were 18.86 lakh base tower stations or sites in India, out of which 35,654 were found where the call drop rate was more than 3 percent. The operators though have improved performance of 15,549 sites, while 17,201 stations still need to be improved.

There are also 2,904 sites where the call volume was very low. Sectoral regulator TRAI measures call drop issue through two parameters -- less than or equal to 2 percent call drops and worst affected cells having more than 3 per cent traffic channel (TCH) drop. Idea, Vodafone, Tata Teleservices (GSM) and Bharti Airtel have the most number of sites where the call drop rate was more than 3 percent.

According to sources, Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad undertook a meeting on August 26, wherein it was decided that efforts, which are being carried out to address the concerns, should continue. Telecom Secretary Rakesh Garg has already spoken to the owners of telecom firms including Sunil Mittal of Bharti Airtel, Anil Ambani of Reliance Communications, and Kumar Mangalam Birla of Idea Cellular, besides the Director of Vodafone Group in London. Call drops have become a severe problem in the recent months and concerns have also been raised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard.

TRAI will issue final recommendations by mid-October on compensation to be paid by mobile operators to their customers in case of call drops. The telecom watchdog has already floated a draft paper on the issue and is reviewing the quality of services being offered by various operators."

The Butterfly Effect holds that a butterfly flapping its wings in some place can, in theory, cause a hurricane somewhere else weeks down the line. The term, coined by Edward Lorenz, came into vogue as weather forecasters saw that a small variation in initial atmospheric conditions can lead to completely unanticipated weather outcomes elsewhere.On 19 August, Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan flapped his wings and set off what could turn out to be a revolutionary storm in the Indian banking system - a storm bigger than the one created when private banks were first given licences in the 1990s.Eleven private parties were given licences to set up ""payment banks"" - banks which can do everything a regular bank can do - take deposits, pay bills, issue cheques and drafts, et al. The only thing they can't do is lend to you and me. Payment banks can only lend to the government and almost anybody with Rs 100 crore in his pocket can, in future, set up a payment bank, assuming they pass the RBI’s “fit and proper” norm (which basically means if you are not a crook, or someone who has cocked a snook at the regulator, you can get a licence). This means payment banks will theoretically be the safest of banks since they have only the government as borrower – and governments don’t default. In future, payment bank licences may be available on tap, and we could see even 50-100 such banks being set up. India will be fully banked over the next decade.That payment banking is a big deal is evident from who’s got the initial set of licences – the big boys and billionaires are there. Among them: the Aditya Birla Group, Reliance Industries (majority owner of Network 18, which publishes Firstpost), the big telcos (Airtel, Vodafone), the National Securities Depository (which holds almost all of India’s stocks in demat form, and provides the backbone for a tax information network), PayTM (India’s biggest mobile wallet company), Tech Mahindra (one of the Top Five IT companies in India), and Sun Pharma’s Dilip Shanghvi. Billionaires wouldn’t be filling in forms at the RBI’s window if they didn’t think payment banking was the in thing, though they might prefer to become regular banks, if that were possible. Since the RBI does not want corporates in banking, they are going for the next big thing that’s available – payment bank licences.The reasons why payment banking will revolutionise money movement are many. Consider the areas they will touch, and how their mere presence will impact everyone.First, and foremost, payment banks will bridge the last mile (or last 10-20 miles) between bank branches and the remote customer living in a rural hamlet. Payment banks will essentially rely on technology to reach payment services to all customers, using mobiles as the vehicle of banking. Mobiles go even where humans don’t. Physical bank branches (or bankers or ATMs) will still be needed for some functions - opening an account, depositing cash, etc - but all day-to-day payments, including peer-to-peer payments) can be done remotely. The mobile phone will become the virtual ATM and small-payments cheque-book. In less than 10 years, every Indian will have a bank account. Payment banks are the key enablers.

Second, banking costs will come down due to intense competition driven by the expected proliferation of payment banks. Currently, we pay through our noses for banking services, whether it is above-limit ATM transactions, additional cheque-books, big money transfers, maintenance of minimum balances, or draft issuance fees. These costs will come down as payment banks start offering zero-balance accounts and low-cost services. Currently, efficient private banks like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank make huge profits from their low-cost current and savings bank accounts, but a big chunk of this will move to payment banks, who may offer higher savings bank rates of 5-7 percent. The HDFCs mint money since they only have to compete with slothful public sector banks. Now, they will have nimbler rivals to worry about. The customer will finally be Queen.

Third, the public sector banks are sitting ducks for bankruptcy and taxpayer bailouts if they do not change. Between then, efficient payment and private sector banks will take away their lucrative businesses and prized customers, as they will be both well capitalised and efficient. The government should privatise the weaker banks quickly if it is not to be stuck with feeding white elephants permanently. It can’t cope with one Air India; if it does not privatise, it will have several Air Indias on its hands. The weaker public sector banks are dead ducks.

Fourth, the arrival of payment banks - including India Post - will transform social welfare and subsidy schemes. Even if the Modi government does no other reform but this one, government subsidy payments to the poor - whether for LPG, kerosene or even food and fertiliser - can now be routed through regular and payment banks. India Post is already there in places where banks aren't there (with over 1.5 lakh post offices), and tomorrow Airtel and Vodafone and Idea (and Reliance Jio, when it enters mobile telephony later this year) will reach customers through mobile-enabled payment systems. The holy triad of Jan Dhan no-frills bank accounts, Aadhaar IDs and mobile banking will enable direct payments to the poor, eliminating fake recipients, ensuring cash in zero-balance accounts, etc. Inclusive banking and subsidy reforms are simply the biggest things to happen during the Modi government, even though the seeds for this were planted by earlier governments. The difference between State Bank and Airtel is simply this: both have over 200 million customers, but Airtel can go where State Bank cannot with a branch.

Fifth, mobile banking will create the conditions for cash-less banking. This means, over time, the mobile will perform the same role as credit and debit cards, obviating the need for too many cash payments. Even ATM expansion can now be slowed down in cities, and focused on distant villages or towns.

Sixth, we now have one additional tool to eliminate black money in large parts of the financial system. A government that wants to eliminate black money - which the Modi government says it wants to - can effectively ban cash transactions once a 95 percent mobile and Jan Dhan penetration rate is achieved. India is close to reaching a mobile user base of one billion, and Jan Dhan is said to have reached all households. The next target for Jan Dhan should be universal adult coverage through mobile, payment banking. It is achievable in five to 10 years, with some public and private investment in financial literacy education and empowerment of rural citizens, especially women.

Seventh, the government will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of payment banking, as payment banks will expand its access to cheap funds. Currently, banks are the major investors in government bonds. While this will remain so even with the entry of payment banks, the sheer impact of additional money coming into payment bank accounts which can only invest in short-term government bills of up to one year's maturity means short-term rates will come down, and the government can borrow more cheaply.

Eighth, bank depositors can expect to earn higher short-terms deposit rates from payment banks, and the old 4 percent savings bank norm will probably fade away.

After payment banks, the RBI will license “small banks”, which have to focus loans on small borrowers and not big corporates. Once this happens, non-bank finance companies will become ""small banks"" and make financial inclusion more complete from the small borrower's point of view.

Between them, payments banks and small banks will make Indian banking more competitive and more inclusive on both the assets and liabilities sides – that is, for both depositors and borrowers. The era of the consumer is finally at hand.The writer is editor-in-chief, digital and publishing, Network18 Group."
"August 20, 2015 01:36 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/quick-guide-whatindias-payment-banks-1499459.html,"Moneycontrol BureauThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on August 19 granted 11 payments banks licence that are set to come up in the next 18 months. What are payment banks and how will they function? How are they different from commercial, scheduled banks? Who are the entities that have been granted licences and why?Here's a quick primer.- The concept of a payment bank was mooted by the RBI in a discussion paper in 2013, which observed that there was a need for having niche banking products. This was followed up by the Nachiket Mor committe on financial inclusion that made a similar recommendation. Later, the RBI issued draft guidelines for issue of licences for payment banks.- The Mor committee made a reference to M-Pesa, the service started by Vodafone in Kenya in 2007 that has spurred the mobile money market in Africa in a big way. Today, M Pesa transactions are said to be worth about 43 percent of Kenya's GDP.- Payment banks can accept deposits up to Rs 1 lakh per savings account, allow for payments transfer and remittances and issue deposits, issue debit cards as well as offer internet banking transactions.- Unlike regular banks, payment banks cannot undertake lending activities such as issuing credit cards or providing loans. Their deposits will have to keep deposits in cash and in liquid securities such as G-secs/T-bills. They will also have access to money market for temporary liquidity management purposes.- Promoters will have to plow in Rs 100 crore of equity capital into payment banks and the same amount will have to be always maintained as minimum net worth.- After the RBI invited applications for licences, as many as 41 entities applied. On August 19, the central bank granted licences to telecom firms or conglomerates such as Vodafone, Airtel, AB Nuvo (which owns Idea) and Reliance Industries (which is to launch Reliance Jio); financial services firms Chola, Fino Paytech and NSDL; tech firms Paytm and Tech Mahindra apart from the Indian Postal Service and Sun Pharma chief Dilip Shanghvi.- At a press conference today, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said the introduction of payment banks was an 'exciting' development and would help improve last-mile connectivity and reach out to people who presently do not have access to formal banking services.- The central bank chief also allayed concerns that payment banks could become a threat to conventional banks' low-cost savings deposit base, and maintained that payment banks could actually serve as feeders for full-fledged banks and help them reach out to newer customers.- Analysts say payment banks will have advantages over regular banks in terms of reach due to their nimble setup but warned such banks will run on thin margins considering that they cannot offer high-yield loans out of their deposits.- Those that have been granted licences say technology will play a crucial role in keeping costs down and help them reaching out to customers that have access to services such as telecom connectivity."
"September 02, 2015 12:04 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/current-affairs-trends/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-dots-net-neutrality-recos-1463237.html,"Ritika Dangemoneycontrol.comThe Department of Telecom (DoT) on Thursday submitted and later made public a report on Net Neutrality. The debate on Net Neutrality- or freedom of the internet- has picked pace in the recent few months leading to the report. The panel, led by Advisor for Technology A K Bhargava has emphasised a consumer's right to Net Neutrality. Here are some of the key points of the report:

1. 50-50 for WhatsApp, Skype users While the panel has recommended keeping the over-the-top (OTT) messaging service of WhatsApp unregulated, it has said voice over internet protocol -VoIP or voice calls (provided by apps like WhatsApp, Viber, Skype) within India may be charged separately. This comes on the back of Indian telecom companies demanding a more level-playing field as they have suffered losses on international traffic due to the players.

2. No extra fees for Facebook, YouTubeThe panel hasn't recommended any extra charges for using social media services (Facebook, YouTube), media services (broadcasting, gaming), trade and commerce services(e-commerce, radio taxi, financial services), cloud services (data hosting & data management platforms/applications). The report says despite the fact that services are being offered to end-users using the network infrastructure created by telecom service providers (TSPs), they do not directly compete with the service offerings for which the TSPs have obtained a licence under applicable law.

3. Zero-ratingThe panel refrained from giving any view on zero-rating, leaving the decision-making with sector regulator TRAI. Zero-rating is the practice of TSPs or Internet Service Providers (ISPs) not charging end customers for data used by specific applications or internet services through the TSP/ ISP's network, in limited or metered data plans.

""Zero rating favours sites, services and applications having the ability to strike deals with TSPs/ISPs, which may not have any incentive in entering into commercial tie-ups with firms that have a small market share,"" the report said in order to maintain a level-playing field for start-ups. 4. Traffic Management

The panel believes that for issues ranging from traffic management to security and integrity of networks, most internet providers manage traffic at peak times. While sometimes it could be a legitimate requirement, companies should not resort to application-specific control, wherein they spare the time sensitive applications and performing congestion control on time insensitive applications. The panel, recommends treating all IP traffic in the same manner.

Though it has not given any particular recommendation on ""search neutrality,"" the panel has flagged principles of Net Neutrality as a concern for public discussion. It has said search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance.

5. Facebook's Internet.org and Gatekeeping

The panel came heavily on Facebook's Internet.org, criticizing it for violating net neutrality norms. Internet.org is a partnership between Facebook and few companies that plans to bring affordable access of selected Internet services to less developed countries.

Until April 2015, Internet.org users could have free access for only a few websites, and the panel deemed Facebook’s role as gatekeeper in determining what websites were in that list as violating Net Neutrality."

A DoT panel on net neutrality is learnt to have opposed projects like Facebook's Internet.org, which allow access to certain websites without mobile data charges, while suggesting that similar plans such as Airtel Zero be allowed with prior clearance from Trai. The panel has stated however that ""collaborations between telecom operators and content providers that enable such gate-keeping role to be played by any entity should be actively discouraged"", sources said. Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had directed the Department of Telecom (DoT) to form a panel on net neutrality and give its recommendation on the matter.

Net neutrality implies that equal treatment be accorded to all Internet traffic and no priority be given to an entity or company based on payment to content or service providers such as telecom companies, which is seen as discriminatory. The neutrality debate heated up in India after telecom operator Airtel launched a platform, Airtel Zero, that would allow free access of some websites on it network. However, the companies were asked to pay Airtel for joining the platform.

Internet.org, on the other hand, is a Facebook-led initiative which aims to bring 5 billion people online in partnership with tech giants like Samsung and Qualcomm as well as mobile operators. In India, it had tied up with Reliance Communications. Sources said the DoT panel has stated that this project has been criticised for violating net neutrality principle and favouring Facebook's own services over its rivals.

Facebook, however, at various forums has said that the project is pro- Internet access and hence does not violate the principle. They said the panel however has favoured allowing of zero-rating platforms, like Airtel Zero, but with a rider that operators should take prior permission of telecom regulator Trai to launch it or take action against such plan if they are founding violating principle of net neutrality, sources said. The DoT did not respond to e-mail query send in this regard, while Facebook spokesperson said ""Until we have the DoT panel findings we are not in a position to comment."" The Internet.org earlier provided restricted Internet access to subscribers RCom, the panel is learnt to have noted.

""The panel observed that until April 2015, Internet.org users could have free access for only a few websites and Facebook's was seen as gatekeeper in determining what websites were in that list. This was seen as violating net neutrality. In early May 2015, due to severe criticism, Facebook opened it to websites that meet certain criteria,"" the source said.

It also observed that large organisations with market have started creating closed ecosystems which profit their business model in the long run.

Sources said the DoT panel report has been submitted to the Telecom Minister.

The panel has suggested that fine or penalty should be imposed on telecom operators if their plan is found in violation of net neutrality -- which is to be defined by government.

""There have been business models by large organisations to increase their user base but unfortunately these initiatives are considered non-competitive, restrictive and in conflict with net neutrality principles,"" said the source, sharing details of the report.

The market for content provision indicates that clear market leaders emerge in a short while and if they are able to dictate the path to specific content, then the principles of non-discriminatory access from a user view point can be compromised.

""The committee, therefore, recommended that content and application providers cannot be permitted to act as gatekeepers and use network operations to extract value even if it is for an ostensible public purpose,"" the source said.

While at the same time, the panel approved allowing of zero rating platform after telecom operators compared it with toll free number.

The committee after consideration of all opinions expressed by net neutrality proponents and network operators felt that there are multitude possibilities in designing tariff plans and everything cannot be validated in advance on parameters of net neutrality.

The panel proposed ""ex-ante determination"" and ""ex-post regulation"" model for dealing with tariff plan including zero rating.

Under ex-ante determination, the panel has proposed telecom operators to follow current practice of filing tariffs before the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and the regulator should carefully vet it on scale of net neutrality before giving its nod."

The telecom department panel that was set up to look into the Net neutrality issue has submitted its report to Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and the report will be made public in a few days.

“Yes, they (the panel) have submitted the report to me. In few days time, the report will be put on the web site, you can see and access it. I have asked the Secretary to send a copy to TRAI, so that they can also have a look at it,” Prasad said at the press meet marking a year of the Modi government.

Net neutrality implies equal treatment be accorded to all internet traffic and no priority should be given to any person or entity or company based on payment, which is seen as discriminatory.

“The decision (on net neutrality) will be taken by the government and the Cabinet. The government will have the benefit of both the reports namely of my department and TRAI. I would expect that report to be expedited,” he said.

Apart from the six-member committee appointed in January this year by DoT, TRAI had also invited comments from stakeholders on issues like Net neutrality and regulation of OTT services like WhatsApp and Skype.

Net Neutrality, a widely debated issue globally, has in the past few weeks caught India’s attention with politicians, corporate leaders and film stars taking to social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook to debate on the issue.

Net neutrality gained national attention after Internet activists and experts flagged telecom giant Bharti Airtel’s ’Airtel Zero’ platform to be in violation of the principle.

Airtel Zero is an open marketing platform that allows customers to access a variety of mobile applications for free, with the data charges being paid by start-ups and large firms.

Also over the last few months, operators like Reliance Communications and Uninor have tied up with players like Facebook, WhatsApp and Wikipedia to offer free usage to consumers."

Stating that telecom operators need to ensure that call drops are ""minimised"", the Minister said telcos need to strengthen their system.

""Call drops need to be minimised. They (private operators) need to reinforce their mechanism. I have directed officials in the department to work on a disincentive architecture (for the operators),"" Prasad said during a press conference on completion of one year of NDA government.

The Minister added that in his role, he is responsible for ensuring that consumer interest is kept in mind.

Telecom Secretary Rakesh Garg has asked the member (technology) in Department of Telecom (DoT) to work on the matter and if required, it will be sent to sectoral regulatorTRAI for its suggestions.

A final call could be taken in six months.

Explaining further, Garg cited the example of a telecom operator which is offering free calls in lieu of call drops.

Meanwhile, on net neutrality, Prasad said the government has received the report and it will be uploaded on DoT's website in next few days.

""We have received the report, it will put on the website in a few days and a copy has been sent to TRAI. As far as the final decision is concerned, the government and Cabinet willtake the final call,"" the Minister said.

There is a huge debate going on in the country over net neutrality, which states that no content should be given preference over the other.

The Minister said spectrum trading and sharing guidelines will be sent to Cabinet by the end of this month.

On post offices offering banking services, Prasad said he is expecting RBI approval for payment bank licence for Postal Department to come in by July-August."

Private telecom operators Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone and Idea Cellular have opposed telecom regulator TRAI's proposal to protect consumers from default activation of mobile internet services that often leads to bill shocks.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) came out with draft rules on April 29 rpt April 29 proposing that operators should not activate mobile internet service without explicit consent of consumers and it should be deactivated on sending an SMS to toll free number 1925.

Consumers get bill shocks due to default activation of mobile internet which continues to be in use even after they exhaust subscribed data limit.

The cost of mobile data used after subscription limit vary from network to network and it can go as high as about Rs 10,000 per gigabyte which under scheme can be purchased for about Rs 175 from leading telecom companies.

While TRAI's consumer survey form counts mobile internet services as a value added service, some telecom operators in their replies to the regulator wanted it to be considered among basic telecom service like voice calls and SMS so that the data services can be activated by default in the connection.

The response from telecom operator shows that all of them activate data services by default and hence consumers willing to take mobile connection have no option but to accept the condition provided in the application form.

""The data and voice services (calls, SMS and roaming) are part of the core bearer services and offered to the consumer as one single bundle of service,"" Reliance Jio Infocomm said.

Airtel said: ""There should not be separate requirement for taking consent through short code for these bearer services.""

Core or basic telecom services like voice calls and SMS are activated in mobile connections by default and cannot be deactivated like hello tunes, SMS alert service etc that are VAS and consumer need to subscribe for these services separately.

Consumers can claim refund of money if deducted by activation of VAS without consent.

Telecom operators have interpreted that their licence treat data services as core service and said that TRAI's proposed rule ""seems to equate the data services with the value added service.""

Idea Cellular said. ""We believe and recommend that data services be activated along with voice services and they should not require any consent from the consumers.""

Vodafone said that it is of ""strong opinion that data should continue to be deactivated by default in the newly acquired mobile connection.""

State-run telecom firms BSNL and MTNL have agreed to accept TRAI's proposal."

Amid a raging debate on ensuring equal Internet access for all, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg today rejected criticism that his internet.org programme, which has RCom as a partner in India, was against the concept of Net Neutrality.

Internet.org is a Facebook-led initiative which states that it aims to bring 5 billion people online in partnership with tech giants like Samsung and Qualcomm. Facebook's partnership with Reliance Communications to provide free Internet access to 33 websites as part of its Internet.org initiative has raised quite a few eyebrows with free Internet activists saying that it violates the idea of Net Neutrality.

The debate in India has also been triggered by mobile operator Airtel introducing an open marketing platform 'Airtel Zero', and TRAI's consultation paper on whether telecom firms can be allowed to charge different rates for different uses of Internet data like email, Internet browsing and use of apps like Whatsapp, Viber and Sky.

Zuckerberg, who has achieved a cult status after founding the world's largest free social networking platform, today defended his initiative in a discussion. He said: ""For people who are not on the Internet though, having some connectivity and some ability to share is always much better than having no ability to connect and share at all.

That's why programmes like Internet.org are important and can co-exist with net neutrality regulations."" Net neutrality implies equal treatment be accorded to all Internet traffic and no priority be given to an entity or company based on payment to service providers like the telecom companies, which is seen as discriminatory.

Zuckerberg said net neutrality is important to ""make sure network operators don't discriminate and limit access to services people want to use, especially in countries where most people are online"".

While the telecom major continues to defend itself saying the platform does not violate the concept, Flipkart has walked out of negotiations with the eCommerce firm stating that it after looking in deeper, it realised that net neutrality ""can get compromised in the future"".

Its competitor Snapdeal's CEO also tweeted his support today saying ""Of course, we are for #NetNeutrality @snapdeal"". According to Net Neutrality India, over 5 lakh emails have been sent to TRAI in support of the issue. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has put up the issue for public feedback with the last date for submitting comments being April 24 and counter comments May 8.

Besides, the government has also formed a panel to study the issue."
"April 13, 2015 10:17 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/current-affairs/net-neutrality-battle-to-saveinternet-heats-up-1066341.html,"Manu Kaushik

The case for net neutrality has slowly but firmly attained critical mass and entered the mainstream consciousness supported by politicians and celebrities like Ravi Shankar Prasad, Digvijay Singh, Shahrukh Khan and Farhan Akhtar tweeting their support for a free internet.

The debate caught public imagination especially after an AIB video explaining net neutrality went viral on the web to the extent that Facebook had to take it off after it’s algos decided the video was spam. But the video was restored shortly, say reports. The video has already been viewed by over 1,141,503 just two days after being uploaded.

Celebrities weighed in and the hashtag #SaveTheInternet and #NetNeutrality began trending on Twitter. The hastag was viewed by more than 19.5 million unique users worldwide, half of which were original posts and the other half retweets. The hashtag ""SaveTheInternet"" reached 19,509,175 (the number of unique users that saw the tweet related to the hashtag).

Concerns regarding a potentially biased Internet came to surface after e-tailer Flipkart signed a deal with Airtel to be featured on its marketing plan -- Airtel Zero. Airtel says through this platform, it will allow consumers to access applications ""free of cost.""

Why then anybody would need to fight off a plan (Airtel Zero) that aims to make web cheaper or in this case ""free of cost""? For the simple reason it discriminates between the apps and services it has signed a deal with and leave out others, thereby giving itself the power to dictate the flow of internet traffic.

In the deal, Flipkart has essentially agreed to buy data from Airtel on behalf of its potential customers in order to provide its app for free. This means that users get to access the Flipkart app for free on Airtel zero platform while they still will be incurred data charges for accessing for example peer websites such as shopclues.com or a start-up, which doesn’t have the financial heft to strike such deals with telecom companies.

Telecom companies will be able to regulate what users access online, the way they access it and in what quantum, if this were to become a norm. The news website medianama.com was among the few that spotted the potential harm this might lead to and built a campaign around it.

Websites like Savetheinternet.in and netneutrality.in (created by reddit user: ishan001) are at the frontline of the battle along with the activist community on Reddit India. The topic ""Fight for Net Neutrality: The way forward"" is ranked highest on Reddit India homepage.

In the discussion threads, online activists discussed ways to increase the reach of the campaign by means of memes and infographics. One came up with a plan: users should down-rate Airtel and Flipkart apps on Google Play and Apple App store.

The telecom regulator TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) has come up with a consultation paper inviting comments from general public on whether telecom companies be allowed to charge users separately for accessing services such as Facebook, Viber, WhatsApp among other social media and messaging apps (called 'OTT' or Over the Top Services in technical jargon).

Apparently, telecom companies such as Airtel are perturbed at heavy profits these OTTs are making, riding on their airwaves and infrastructure, which they say involve heavy capital infrastructure and maintenance cost. They also allege losing call and messaging revenue to OTTs such as WhatApp and Viber.

The above two issues are collectively pose a grave threat to the concept of Net neutrality, say activists. The moderators of the above discussion thread and Medianama.com have collated answers and made TRAI's questionnaire of 20 questions (spread over 118 pages) easier to understand.

They have also urged visitors to mail their responses to TRAI keeping netneutralityindia02@gmail.com in the bcc (option is given to the user to edit the collated answers). Over 1 Lakh emails have been sent to TRAI via this method.

Currently, there is no law to enforce net neutrality but one Redditer--Karan Shah, has taken it upon himself to fill the gap. He has come up with ""Guidelines on the Net Neutrality and Internet Traffic Management Act, 2015.""

""There are literally no guidelines on this issue. The act which should ideally cover these things dates to 1885, a time we didn’t even have internet! Therefore, the idea is that there should be some guidelines. TRAI has come up with a paper on this very issue, but the paper is largely biased towards the telecom players and thus the campaign was launched so that TRAI could be told that Net Neutrality matters. In line with what all major developed countries have ruled: the ideal internet should be neutral, like how we buy electricity: You would wonder how consumers would react if the electricity discom started selling fan pack, tube light pack, CFL pack, etc? Right now, just this is happening, in the virtual world,"" said Shah."

India Ratings & Research (Ind-Ra) expects top telcos (Airtel, Vodafone, Idea and Reliance Communications), whose licences are set to expire in 2015-2016, to continue bidding aggressively during the on-going spectrum auction. The auction is crucial for these operators as they might have to give up some of their existing operations in profitable areas if they are unable to acquire the desired spectrum.

The scarcity of spectrum across all bands and the cabinet’s decision to keep the base price at a premium of 17% to 36% over the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) recommendations, have also added to the pricing pressures.

The spectrum which has been put up for auction is completely ‘liberalised’, which means that there is no restriction on the technology that telecos can adopt to provide services using the spectrum blocks allocated through this auction. Contiguity of the spectrum being offered thus becomes more crucial in a technology neutral environment as contiguous bands can be used to deploy higher technology e.g. 3G services over a 900MHz band and 4G services over an 800MHz band.

The deployment of 3G services on the 900MHz band provides better indoor reach while cutting costs up to 50%-70% for both capex and opex. As the proposed base price is comparable for both the 900MHz and 2100MHz bands, Ind-Ra believes that demand for the contiguous 900MHz spectrum is bound to be highly competitive for the above reasons.

Reliance Jio, which already has pan-India 4G capable bands, has already submitted the highest earnest money deposit displaying a determination to bid for a large quantum of the spectrum blocks. We believe that RJio is targeting a pan-India 3G presence, to diversify from the current data-only strategy, by acquiring a combination of 900MHz and 2100MHz bands put to auction across LSAs. This is bound to increase competition especially in the scarce 900MHz band where existing operators will fight it out to safeguard their existing operations.

Ind-Ra believes that India’s low internet reach (27.5% of telecom subscribers) and increasing acceptance of ecommerce and social media shall drive a surge in data consumption. Ind-Ra therefore expects operators to place competitive bids to enhance their data capabilities either through 3G or 4G services keeping in mind that the spectrum being auctioned is here to stay for the next 20 years.

As a result of spectrum scarcity, technology liberalisation, advantages of contiguity and RJio’s interest in pan-India voice telephony Ind-Ra expects the aggressive bidding to push up spectrum prices. Telcos are already struggling with limited opportunities to expand margins further as voice revenues have matured and there is possibility of stress on data tariffs once RJio enters the fray. Higher spectrum prices will largely be debt funded and shall increase leverage and impact the credit profiles of large telcos.

It is expected to be completed by June 2015. Airtel claims its mobile network with 1,42,898 base stations covers an area of 87 percent of India's population. BSNL's mobile network covers an area of 72 percent of country's population which will further increase after completion of phase 7 network expansion.

The state-run telecom firm will have about 1,10,000 base stations after June this year."

Tech Mahindra today said its sister company Mahindra Finance will become equal shareholder if the Reserve Bank clears its payment bank licence, and the company is also in talks with the World Bank Group member IFC for a partnership in the foray.

""The Mahindra group is also in talks with IFC for a partnership for the payment bank which, if fructified, we will dilute stake,"" Tech Mahindra mobility head Jagdish Mitra told Media here. ""We will be forming a separate company and once we get an approval from the RBI, Mahindra Finance will become a 50 percent partner,"" he said.

The investment will be much larger than the Rs 100-crore minimum required by the RBI, Mitra added. ""It is a long-term business for us and the group is committed to capitalise as and when needed. It will be more than the Rs 100-crore and we already have money allocated,"" Mitra said, adding the tie-up with IFC is more strategic than an equity partnership.

The payments bank floated by the Mahindras wants to learn from the best global experiences, where IFC will be of help with experiences from its investee companies from the world over, he said, adding Tech Mahindra is also in talks with mobile operators for a tie-up.

The Reserve Bank accepted applications from over 40 companies/individuals last week for payment banks. Most of the big telecom players who possess huge distribution networks have entered the fray.

Reliance Industries tied up with SBI; Airtel with Kotak Bank. The group decided to have its technology company at the front-end because there are multiple regulatory approvals which the non-banking financier Mahindra Finance has to go through, Mitra said."

""Eff. (effective) 3-Dec 2014, bill plan rental for your airtel mobile will be revised from Rs 199 per month to Rs 224 per month,"" Airtel said in a message to its customers.

Industry sources said Airtel has increased rates across low rental plans. Queries send to Airtel did not elicit any immediate reply.

Airtel has a mobile subscriber base of over 20 crore customers, which include both pre-paid and post-paid users.

Last week, Bharti Airtel had reported nearly three-fold jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,383 crore for the September quarter on growth in mobile data revenues.

This is the second hike in rates of telecom services by the company within a period of three months. In September, the company had increased mobile internet rates by up to 33 percent and reduced benefit under plans for its pre-paid customers.

Globacom, which is owned by Nigerian billionaire Mike Adenuga, was fined 277.5 million naira, while South Africa's MTN and Airtel, which is owned by Bharti Airtel, were each fined 185 million naira, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said in a statement.

The NCC will charge each company 2.5 million naira for every day the fine is not paid after March 7, it said. The month-long ban on selling SIM cards in a country of around 170 million people could be the most damaging.

The penalties were imposed because the operators had failed to meet key performance indicators in January, the NCC said."

The government’s auction of 900 Mhz and 1,800 Mhz spectrum has gotten off to a good start. Even in an industry that faces strong consolidation headwinds, the government has got bids of Rs 39,300 crore, Rs 45,000 crore and Rs 50,000 crore on days one, two and three, respectively.

This compares well with the previous two rounds of bidding that took place in 2010 and 2012 that turned out to be damp squibs.

Here are some reasons why the auctions have largely been successful this time.

Delhi/Mumbai licence expiry

The licenses of telecom companies that hold the coveted 900 Mhz spectrum in cities such as Mumbai and Delhi were due to expire in November.

As a result, these companies had no other option but to bid aggressively to hold on to the millions of subscribers they had in these prime cities.

Not surprisingly, auctions for the scarce 900 Mhz band (in which only 45 Mhz was put up on the block compared to 385 Mhz in the 1800 band) were bid up several times the base price.

The 900 Mhz wavelength is also considered more cost-effective than the 1800 Mhz band.

Better pricing

Compared to the 2012 auctions, when the government faced flak for what was widely perceived to be exorbitant pricing, most industry players had said pricing was rational this time around.

“The reserve price is reasonable and will encourage bidding,” Rajan Matthews, director general, Cellular Operators Association of India, told CNBC-TV18 in an interview in December.

Rel Jio entry

The entry of Mukesh Ambani-backed Reliance Jio also changed things a bit. Reliance was expected to bid aggressively for the 1800 Mhz band, which would help augment its to-be-launched 4G services, a sentiment echoed by former Airtel CEO Sanjay Kapoor here.

Lesser regulatory uncertainty

A week prior to the auction, the government issued rules laying out clear rules for spectrum usage charges.

Large telecom companies had been complaining against the “unfair” nature of the SUC’s previous structure -- which charged different fees for companies of different sizes -- and this ruling helped give the industry further clarity in terms of what it could expect by way of revenues going into the auction.

Also, during the previous two rounds, regulatory uncertainty arising from the cancelled licenses in the wake of the 2G scam was high, impacting sentiment."

Telecom regulator Trai has suggested a reduction in the bank guarantee given by mobile operators, and sought some clarifications on network roll-out conditions for the spectrum auctions slated for February 3.

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has written a letter to the Department of Telecom asking it to reduce performance bank guarantee (PBG) substantially to Rs 14 crore for each non-metro service area, and Rs 7 crore for Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata service areas.

As per the auction rules, DoT has asked new entrants in any service area to submit Rs 35 crore PBG and existing service providers Rs 21 crore per service area for a minimum period of six years before signing the licence agreement.

According to Trai, if a telecom operator misses the deadline for rolling out networks there can be a maximum penalty of Rs 7 crore in the 5-phase roll-out, and beyond the grace period the company's licence can be cancelled.

Trai said that at any point of time a company can't be in violation of more than two consecutive phases, for which the maximum possible penalty can be Rs 14 crore.

""Trai thus wants PBG amount should be Rs 14 crore for each licenced service area (LSA) except Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata where PBG should be Rs 7 crore per LSA,"" official sources said, citing the letter dated January 2.

The last date for stakeholders to seek clarifications on DoT's auction rules was December 24. DoT issued clarifications and amendments on January 2, when the Trai letter was written. However, it could not be ascertained if DoT will take into account these suggestions.

Trai has asked DoT to treat radiowaves in 900 Mhz and 1800 Mhz bands as separate set of frequencies instead of counting them as one set. At present, both these bands are used by GSM service providers like Airtel, Vodafone and Idea.

The regulator has sought clarification on assessing roll-out obligation of a telecom operator if it decides to deploy different technologies in these bands. Trai has suggested that DoT allow telecom operators to deploy any technology in the spectrum alloted through auction.

The auction rules say that within one month of obtaining the licence, telecom operator shall provide details of the technology proposed to be deployed for operation, if the technology happens to be GSM/WCDMA (3G)/LTE (4G) and one year before deploying any other new technology.

Trai has asked DoT to incorporate an additional point that if a telecom operator decides to shift to any new technology mid-way of the licence period, then it should give minimum notice of three months to customers who are likely to be affected with the change."

Telecom regulator TRAI has told the government that it cannot suggest a price for auction of spectrum in CDMA-band in the stipulated 15 days and the process needs to be started afresh if reserve price for such airwaves is to be set.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had in September proposed a cut of up to 60 percent in the minimum auction prices for mobile phone spectrum used by GSM technology players like Airtel and Vodafone, but recommended no auction of 800 MHz spectrum used by CDMA players.The regulator was criticised for allegedly favouring GSM service providers and last week the Telecom Commission asked TRAI to recommend the reserve price for 800 MHz band within 15 days.Sources said TRAI replied back saying its has responded in full on the original reference made to it and if the government wants it to suggest a price for 800 MHz spectrum, it should come as a fresh reference so that process can be started afresh.TRAI in its reply to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) said: ""The Authority is of the opinion that the action on original reference is over and done with. There can be no continuing reference to that earlier reference. It is now for the central government to take a final decision.""Last week, DoT explained TRAI that E-GSM band required vacation of spectrum by the Defence Ministry which is likely to take time and keeping unsold spectrum in the 800 Mhz band would result in forgone revenues for government.TRAI, however, has said that the last week communication cannot be in continuation with earlier reference on which it has already given its recommendation and government needs to clarifiy if it is is a fresh reference.""The reference dated November 12, 2013 is a new reference and TRAI will be able to proceed with the matter if it is clarified and confirmed that this is fresh statutory reference seeking recommendation of the Authority,"" TRAI said.The regulator further slammed DoT for asking to send recommendation preferably within 15 days.""There is no provision in the TRAI Act which enables the stipulation of time limits. There is also no provision which allows for a preference on time limits to be indicated by the DoT...Hence, it is clearly not appropriate for the DoT to presume that it can suggest a time limit, even as a preference"" TRAI said."

The Empowered Group of Ministers on telecom is expected to discuss on November 22 the sector’s first merger and acquisition (M&A) guidelines as well as the roadmap for the third round of spectrum auction.

“EGoM is scheduled to meet on November 22. Besides auction related matters, the Department of Telecom will place before them the M&A guidelines as recommended by the Telecom Commission,” a Telecom Ministry official told PTI.

Inter-ministerial panel Telecom Commission has suggested about 25 per cent higher base price compared to the amount recommended by sectoral regulator TRAI for radiowaves used for mobile phone services for the proposed auction.

The Telecom Commission had only forwarded its view on two sets of airwaves used by GSM players like Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular.

The official said DoT has written on Tuesday to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India to suggest a base price for CDMA spectrum used by players like Sistema Shyam Teleservices, Tata Teleservices and Reliance Communications in 15 days.

TRAI had recommended against of auction of CDMA spectrum at the moment and suggested to explore if part of these airwaves can be used for extended GSM services.

The official said DoT is working on other details for auction of all three sets of spectrum in third round which is expected to start in January.

The much-awaited M&A guidelines by the industry, that were expected to be announced this week, will get delayed further and likely to be made public after the EGoM decision.

India's second largest telecom operator Vodafone expects phone call and other mobile services rates to go up every year, indicating that low tariff regime may not be sustainable any longer for the industry.

""We have lower tariffs for 18 years against inflation of 8-9 percent per year. Now, can you do that forever? No you can't,"" Vodafone India Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Marten Pieters said in an interview to PTI. ""So the point has come where lowest has been seen, we will have to increase our tariffs every year depending on cost levels,"" he said.He said that like everyone else, the telecom industry too has to increase the prices. Last month the company increased 2G mobile Internet rates along with two other players, Airtel and Idea Cellular , in the range of 25-30 percent. Peiters said that going forward 2G data rates and 3G data rates will be at same level indicating a further hike in 2G mobile Internet rates.""We started 6-7 times high tariff rate when we opened up 3G network. It is now back to 1.5 to 1.6 times of 2G data rates. It over time will come together. But it can't come over time just by lowering 3G tariff, it needs to also see increase of 2G tariffs. Once it is equal, it doesn't matter to customer anymore,"" Pieters said.The company's competitors such as Reliance Communications and Aircel have, meanwhile, reduced 3G mobile Internet rates to bring them on par with 2G mobile Internet rates. Pieters said that industry will have to work to create efficiency in the network to handle increasing load. ""My assumption is that our price increase will always be lower than inflation but you can't of-course forever keep lowering your prices, its impossible,"" he added.In a bid to remain profitable, leading telecom operators have increased rates of special tariff vouchers and reduced free minutes usage. Bharti Airtel too has said recently that the current tariffs in the country ""are at absolutely unsustainable levels"". Pieters said however that despite the tariff hikes India still has the lowest tariffs in the world.""India has still the lowest tariffs in the world. I think there is only one country which is coming closer, which is China. The only difference being that in China, there are only three operators, they are very profitable and they invested last year USD 55 billion in telecom infrastructure.

The new deal was inked at the BCCI's marketing committee meeting here today and Board secretary Sanjay Patel said they were not disappointed with the reduced price considering the ""turmoil in the financial market"".""The Marketing Committee has awarded the Title Sponsorship Rights for all series to be played in India in the 2013-14 season to Star India Pvt.

But we are very happy (with price),"" Patel told reporters after the meeting here.""We are pleased that Star and ESPN Group bid for both the series. That means Australia and West Indies (series) and the deal will be close to Rs 26 crore. Only one bid was there and the minimum bidding price (is what) they have accepted.

Asserting that there is nobody in India who can buy Airtel, Bharti group Chairman Sunil Mittal today said the telecom firm will look at opportunities to acquire another firm in India, provided that there is a clear merger and acquisition policy in place.

""I don't think so that there is anybody in India who can buy us,"" Mittal told PTI here when asked about the new M&A norms in the works and as to whether his company would be the biggest buyer or the biggest seller.

However, he added: ""We will be looking at opportunities (for consolidation) but for that a clear M&A policy which has the objective of being an enabler for consolidation is required.""

Airtel is India's largest telecom company with 192.22 million subscribers as of August-end. The company had a market capitalisation of Rs 1.28 lakh crore as on October 1.

It is among the world's top five telecom firms and has operations in 20 countries in Asia and Africa with total subscriber base of over 275 million.

Mittal also said its partner SingTel would like Airtel to be a consolidator in the market.

""SingTel chairman was in India recently and he made a statement that we will like Airtel to be the consolidator in the market,"" he added.

Mittal welcomed Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal's recent statement that the M&A policy would be announced by October 15. ""We are very encouraged with the ministers statement that something would be coming out in October,"" he said.

Telecom operators have been waiting for long to see the final guidelines of merger and acquisition (M&A). India has 13 mobile service providers with some of them expected to go in for consolidation once the final guidelines are in place.

Although the telecom ministry had announced broad guidelines for M&As in February last year, the detailed norms are yet to be be unveiled. The guidelines that have been okayed in-principle include expeditious approval to merger proposals of telecom companies if their combined market share is up to 35 per cent.

The ministry will seek telecom regulator Trai's recommendation in case the resultant entity has market share of 35 to 60 per cent."
"September 27, 2013 05:30 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/-1636627.html,"Sistema Shyam Teleservices Ltd, which offers mobile services under the MTS brand, has informed Trai that it wants to invest in India and participate in spectrum auctions to expand operations across the country.

SSTL has said this in a protest letter to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India against its recommendation that there should be no auction of CDMA airwaves. It was only bidder for the CDMA spectrum (800 Mhz band) in the March 2013 auctions and won radiowaves to operate in 8 circles for Rs 3,639 crore.

Spectrum auction expected in Jan, target Rs 11k cr revenue

In the letter, SSTL CEO Dmitry Shukov said: ""We have already made USD 3.6 billion long-term investment in India and would need additional spectrum to meet the growing demand from subscribers for better quality services.

""SSTL is committed towards India, and are willing to continue to make investments in India."" Trai has said in its recommendations that there is no demand for the CDMA spectrum, except from SSTL, as was seen in the last auction and one telecom operator had offered to surrender some its airwaves frequency in the CDMA band.

The regulator also said that unlike 1800 Mhz band (2G spectrum), government is not bound by the Supreme Court order to auction CDMA radiowaves, recommending that ""the auction in the 800 MHz band should not be carried out now"".

Countering the point, Shukov said that there was no demand for even premium 2G spectrum in 900 Mhz band but still Trai has recommended its auction at much lower rate. ""Had reserve price for 800 MHz spectrum band been reasonable, we may have bought more spectrum in 8 circles and participated in auction for remaining 13 circles and continued with Pan India operations,"" he said in the letter dated September 20.

Trai has recommended up to 62 per cent lower price for 900 Mhz band spectrum compared to last reserve price. Government is considering auction of certain amount of frequencies in 900 Mhz band which are with telecom companies like Airtel, Vodafone and Loop Mobile in service areas where their licences will expire in the last quarter of 2014.

Shukov has also protested against Trai recommendation to explore opportunity for making part of CDMA spectrum band available for extended GSM services. ""We are perturbed by the Authority's recommendation to cull out significant portion of 800 MHz band to create EGSM band and withhold auction of 800 MHz spectrum band. Our decision to investment in 800 MHz spectrum band was based on current and future availability of spectrum in this band,"" he said."

The DoT may soon issue new telecom licences to Idea Cellular which had earlier refused to accept guidelines related to 3G roaming pacts in the unified license, sources said. The new licence agreement between DoT and Idea may also incorporate certain clauses proposed by Idea, they added.

The Department had said that it was illegal for telecom operators to sell 3G services in areas where they do not have spectrum. Telecom companies Airtel , Vodafone and Idea Cellular had contested the DoT's point and the matter is now sub-judice.Telecom tribunal TDSAT had given a split verdict on the dispute between DoT and the three operators over 3G intra-circle roaming pacts. The matter is now pending with the Delhi High Court.Idea had earlier refused to sign new telecom permit (Unified Licence) as it barred operators from entering into 3G intra-circle roaming agreement. The company had said the norms can be implemented only after final judgement of the court.The DoT and Idea Cellular, sources said, have agreed to follow the court order with respect to implementation of norms related to 3G roaming pacts in new licences and the same has been approved by Minister of Communications and IT Kapil Sibal.""The approval of the minister has been obtained to sign the UL with Idea Cellular with addition of the above mentioned condition in the UL (AS) for Assam, West Bengal, North East, Tamil Nadu and Kolkata service area,"" official sources said.When contacted Idea Cellular refused to comment on the development. Idea had emerged second biggest winner by getting spectrum in 8 circles which included all the seven circles where its licences were cancelled and an additional win in Bihar where it licences were unaffected by the apex court order that cancelled 122 telecom permits in 2G scam.The seven circles where it had to take Unified Licences to operate include Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Kolkata, North East, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.DoT has also suggested signing Unified Licence agreement for Jammu and Kashmir and Orissa service areas where there is no mention of 3G roaming pact norms."

Country's largest lender SBI has said banks may not lend for telecom spectrum purchases if prices are kept high, like in the case of 3G airwaves auction, as such funding is treated as unsecured loans. SBI apprehends that unsecured loans may lead to higher provisioning of amounts at risk in its financials, which may adversely impact credit rating.

""Holding unsecured assets on the banks books have in turn several implications...In case the future spectrum is priced at high levels, as in the case of 3G spectrum then lenders may not be in a position to fund these business plans considering the unsecured nature of the lending,"" SBI said in its comment to telecom regulator TRAI on spectrum valuation.3G airwaves were auctioned in 2010 and fetched over Rs 67,000 crore to the national exchequer.Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has earlier recommended around 11 times high spectrum base price compared to amount paid by telecom operators till 2008. The regulator used 3G prices as one of key benchmark for recommending reserve price for spectrum auction held in November 2012.Telecom players have frequently raised issue of lack of finance for the sector. Following this government, roped in SBI in a tripartite agreement to facilitate funding for spectrum auctions that were held in November 2012 and March 2013.Indian banks have already suffered a jolt of around Rs 28,000 crore when telecom licences of their clients were cancelled by Supreme Court in February 2012. SBI added that players who won wireless broadband spectrum (BWA), being used for 4G services, are better placed compared to telecom players who opted for 3G with regard to investments they have in infrastructure.""Therefore, it would not be appropriate to use the prices obtained in the 3G auction as a basis for spectrum valuation in 2013,"" SBI said.While Airtel , Aircel, BSNL and MTNL have both BWA and 3G spectrum, telecom players Idea Cellular Tata Teleservices , Vodafone and S Tel opted for only 3G spectrum in 2010 auctions.Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio Infocomm is only company to have pan-India BWA spectrum. Other BWA spectrum holders include Tikona Digital and Augere.The bank said 3G spectrum holders will face tough competition when making voice calls on internet will be allowed. Under new telecom licence regime, government has made provision to allow making calls on mobile or fixed phone through VoIP service like Skype, Gtalk etc. There are many companies who provide free VoIP service but calls from mobile and fixed phone are charged on per second or minute basis.SBI suggested the government allow trading of spectrum through bourses or a common trading platform as it can not only ensure efficient utilisation, but also provide liquidityfor the resource with players not having to wait for auctions, which take place only periodically.""Further, steady availability of spectrum through exchange shall encourage competition and ensure that niche players requiring smaller quantities of spectrum are also able to compete in the market. The exchange can also be utilised by the government for release of additional spectrum as is the case in offers of sale for equity shares,"" SBI said.The Department of Telecom is learnt to have recently approached TRAI for its views on allowing spectrum trading in the country, sources said."

Brokerage house Motilal Oswal sees HCL Tech and Hindalco as the key beneficiaries of rupee depreciation, while Bharti Airtel and Maruti Suzuki are seen the key losers.Following is the brokerage’s snapshot of how the companies stand to gain/lose* For Hindalco, rupee depreciation will bolster its standalone revenues which are mainly dollar linked, while most of its operating expenditure remains stable. Accordingly, our EPS estimates for FY15 is increased by 20 percent to Rs 20/share. HCL Tech has the maximum EPS sensitivity to movements in currency. This is partly due to the higher operating leverage, resulting in 11 percent change in EPS. Maruti Suzuki and Bharti Airtel will be negatively impacted due to rupee depreciation.* Maruti Suzuki has hedged 40 percent JPY (yen)/USD exposure (including indirect and royalty) at 95-98 levels for FY14 (90-92 for 4QFY13), while for INR/USD leg is open. The recent pull back in USD/JPY (thereby impacting rates for further hedges) coupled with INR depreciation would impact Maruti Suzuki’s FY14E/15E EPS by 6.8/7.7 percent"

Bharti Airtel Ltd was today restrained by the Supreme Court from providing 3G roaming services to new customers in seven circles where it does not have license to do so.

The apex court also said that no coercive steps will be taken on the issue of penalty raised against Airtel for allegedly illegally providing 3G services. The seven circles where Airtel does not have license to provide 3G services are Kolkata, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh East and Kerala.

A bench comprising Chief Justice Altamas Kabir and Justice Vikramajit Sen issued notices to the Centre and Reliance Communications Ltd and sought their response within two weeks on the petition filed by Bharti Airtel challenging a Delhi High Court order giving its nod to DoT's decision to hold the 3G roaming pact of the telecom major as illegal.

The apex court said thereafter the respondents will file rejoinder within two weeks and posted the matter for hearing on May 9. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had on March 15 issued a notification restraining Bharti from providing 3G intra-circle roaming facilities in seven circles where it did not have the spectrum and also levied penalty of Rs 350 crore (Rs 50 crore per circle) for allegedly violating the licence terms and conditions.

On March 18, a single-judge bench of the high court had stayed the operation of the notification. However, on a plea filed by Reliance, a division bench of

the high court on April 4 had set aside the single judge's order. The telecom major has challenged the decision of the division bench of the high court.

On April 8, the apex court had asked the government to refrain from taking any ""coercive steps"" against Bharti Airtel and asked the parties to maintain status quo on the issue till the matter is heard on April 11.

Airtel in its plea had contended that the division bench of the high court was wrong in entertaining the plea of Reliance as it was not a party before the single judge. However, counsel appearing for Reliance, had submitted before the apex court that what Airtel has been doing for two years was completely illegal as it did not have licence for 3G in seven circles, including Kolkata where it was selling the

'SIM' cards for 3G mobile connections. Reliance in its plea before the high court had sought directions to ""declare and hold 3G intra-circle roaming agreements entered into between Bharti and other service providers as illegal and in violation of Article 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution."""

Consumers will now have to pay up to 30 per cent extra for data services as leading telecom players Bharti Airtel and Vodafone are hiking tariffs and

others may soon follow suit.

Bharti Airtel recently increased 2G data rates and rivals are expected to take similar steps to cover costs and improve margins, said industry officials. Airtel recently revised its 1GB 2G data plan from Rs 100 to Rs 125.""This nominal price revision is subject to rate elasticity, customer demand and supporting cost structures. Our recent revision...is an increase of only 2-3 paise per MB. It continues to be an excellent value proposition for ourcustomers,"" an Airtel spokesperson said.Vodafone too has made similar changes in the monthly plans and has reduced data limits available under various prepaid plans. While the Rs 95 plan (28 days validity) is now available for Rs 124, others plans allowing 250 MB data usage and 150 MB usage have been reduced to 150 MB and 100MB, respectively.When contacted, Vodafone spokesperson told PTI: ""We are aware of some of our competitors increasing tariffs for 2G data recently. ""We see this as an encouraging step for the industry and are taking corrective measures accordingly at our end."" Idea Cellular spokesperson declined to comment, but sources said the company may also revise data tariffs.Bharti Airtel has maintained for long that prices of voice and non-voice services need to be hiked for the telecom industry to remain healthy, invest in future technologies and generate returns for shareholders.""The current tariffs do not even cover marginal costs for most operators. So from an economics perspective, do we need to increase prices? The answer is yes,"" Bharti Airtel CEO (India and South Asia) Sanjay Kapoor had said earlier. Industry officials say that competitive pressures have prevented telecom operators from hiking rates so far."

Agency sources said a final view on the charge sheet in the case would be taken once AG gives his opinion on the matter which is likely to come tomorrow. While a group of CBI officials believed a case against the two telecom companies was made out as they were main beneficiaries of the laid down policy, another team of officials involved in decision-making differed, official sources said today.

CBI had registered a case against the then Telecom Secretary Shyamal Ghosh and Deputy Director General (Value Added Services) J R Gupta and unnamed officials of Bharti Cellular (now known as Bharti Airtel), and Hutchinson Max and Sterling Cellular (now known as Vodafone Essar) last November.

The agency had alleged the Telecom department had increased the base spectrum for telecom companies from 4.4 MhZ to 6.2 MhZ during Pramod Mahajan's tenure as Telecom Minister from 2001 to 2003 and also allocated extra spectrum on subscriber-based criteria."

An Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) headed by finance minister P Chidambaram had proposed imposition of a one-time fee on GSM mobile operators holding more than 4.4 MHz of spectrum and CDMA operators with over 2.5 MHz airwaves.The decision, on which Cabinet will take a final call, is expected to garner Rs 27,000 crore for the government. Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) represents the operators like Airtel , Vodafone and Idea which use the GSM technology.On the other hand,the Association of Unified Service Providers in India (AUSPI)represents players using dual technology and include Tata Teleservices and Reliance Communication. COAI has written to Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal saying that such a move would increase tariffs while AUSPI in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has sought shelving ofthe EGoM decision.""Imposing one-time spectrum charges would be a retrograde step which will impact consumer tariffs directly. It also violates the right granted under the policy decision under which spectrum has already been allocated to the licencees,"" COAI said in its letter to Sibal.It said said operators have been paying higher spectrum charges for all spectrum allocated thus far. ""Any further additional charge by way of a one-time fee will be contradictory to DoT position on the matter,"" COAIsaid. AUSPI said EGoM recommendations should be ""reconsidered...as they are not legally tenable and against the well-established principle of bounden duty of the government to honour its existing contracts with the licensees""."

"July 13, 2012 08:44 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/-1260119.html,"Its only when we know the reasons can we prevent the pitfalls

Entrepreneurs are an optimistic lot. They are positive, energetic and believe that their product, service or innovation will be successful, change the world and make them rich!! So the last thing an entrepreneur wants to focus on is failure!

One of the least understood aspects of entrepreneurship is why businesses fail, and there’s a simple reason for the confusion: Most of the evidence comes from the entrepreneurs themselves. In spite of success stories that you hear and read, only a small number of businesses become truly successful. For every Airtel or Infosys, there are several that failed or just survived and did okay.

Businesses often fail because founders and investors neglect to look before they leap, surging forward with plans without taking the time to realize that the base assumption of the business plan is wrong. They believe they can predict the future, rather than try to create a future with their customers. Entrepreneurs tend to be single-minded with their strategies - wanting the venture to be all about the product or service or all about the sales, without taking time to form a balanced plan.

I have had a close-up view of a few business failures-including my own, and several ventures in which I have invested. And from my observation, the reasons for failure cited by the owners are frequently off point, which kind of makes sense when you think about it. If the owners really knew what they were doing wrong, they might have been able to fix the problem. What follows, based on my own experiences and observations, are the top reasons businesses fail. Some are obvious, and some may surprise you.

Poor Management: Many a report on business failures cites poor management as the number one reason for failure. Entrepreneurs frequently lack relevant business and management expertise in areas such as finance, marketing & sales and hiring and managing employees. Unless they recognize what they don't do well, and seek help, business owners will soon face disaster. A good entrepreneur knows the gaps in his team and moves quickly to fill those gaps.

No Planning: Planning forces an entrepreneur to think through, analyze and look before leaping, and making sure that market conditions, customer data and base assumptions are reviewed and finetuned. Proper planning ensures that businesses can adapt to changing customer demands and the environment. Unless the entrepreneur reviews and updates his plan on regular basis, he is setting himself to fail. At the same time, it is important to realize that just planning will not yield success too. And all too often, they do not give themselves wiggle room to pivot midstream if the initial idea doesn't jibe with customer demand. Execution & flexibility is absolutely important!

Undefined Target Market & Demand: Many entrepreneurs seem to fall in love with their product/creation. The feeling of having created something overwhelms their sensibilities. They forget that for commercial success, every product or service, no matter how great, needs a target market. Similarly, some entrepreneurs launch businesses without defining what constitutes their core/target market. The math just doesn't work. There is not enough demand for the product or service at a price that will make it viable and sustainable. This, for example, would include a start-up trying to compete against Infosys and its economies of scale. Timing is also important - it determines demand, funding and the ability to scale up and grow.

Not being persistent: I have seen several businesses fail because the entrepreneur and team are not persistent and do not keep trying. They give up easily. The biggest of brands and the successful entrepreneurs faced failure during their initial days. So, what makes you different? Why do you need a guarantee that losses will never come knocking on your door? The learning curve is essentially the same for everybody. Entrepreneurs who aren't ready for the drill shouldn't consider themselves as long-term players. ""No Pain, No Gain"" isn't just a gymming quote fad; it is a truth about life, including running a business.

Failure to Sell/Market: Another key factor for failure is the failure to understand the importance of marketing and selling. Do not be focused on trying to build the best mousetrap alone; focus on selling and getting customer feedback that will help you build an effective mousetrap faster and in line with customer expectations. Entrepreneurs need to understand that selling is an absolutely key factor that separates the successful from the mediocre. If you are not good at salesman, make sure that one of your first hires is a good salesperson. Having created a great product doesn't guarantee success to anybody. You need to market it and make investors and consumers realize its uniqueness. Many entrepreneurs tend to sit back, smugly confident that the ""greatness"" of their idea will magnetize investors and sales.

People Issues: One of the most common reasons for business failure is team and people issues. What kind of team; do my employees share my vision and understand the company, its products and its business plan. Do members of the management team have complementary skills and can work in a team environment? I have seen companies where the founders/promoters to have similar backgrounds and experience, and this leaves holes in important places.

Unplanned /Aggressive growth. This one might be the saddest of all reasons for failure - a successful business that is ruined by too aggressive or unplanned expansion. This would include moving into markets that are not as profitable, experiencing growing pains that damage the business, or borrowing too much money in an attempt to keep growth at a particular rate. Sustainable growth should be the mantra. This is hard, considering the fact that growing a profitable organization and dreaming of becoming the next Ambani or Birla is the dream of every entrepreneur.

Poor Financial Management: You cannot be in control of a business if you don't know what is going on. With bad numbers, or no numbers, a company is flying blind, and it happens all of the time. Why? For one thing, it is a common - and disastrous - misconception that an outside accounting firm hired primarily to do the taxes will keep watch over the business. In reality, that is the job of the chief financial officer, one of the many hats an entrepreneur has to wear until a real one is hired. Good entrepreneurs understand the importance of numbers and are disciplined to manage and run their organizations by paying very close attention to financials.

Lack of a cash cushion. Entrepreneurs need to understand and remember that business is cyclical and that bad things can and will happen over time - the loss of an important customer, changes in regulation, competition, or aggressive expansion. These things can all stress the finances of a company. A common fatal mistake for many failed businesses is having insufficient operating capital. It is imperative to ascertain how much money your business will require. Your CA/Advisor can help ascertain total capital requirement, at least till the business gets going and can support costs. Remember, Cash is King!

Operational Mediocrity & Inefficiencies: Every start-up needs to go through a phase of financial crunches, breaking-even and entering profitability. Unless an entrepreneur is backed by daddy's unending money resources, it doesn't make sense to operate in a lavish manner. Recruiting staff beyond the immediate requirement and allowing overheads exceed the initial estimate starts eating into financial stability.

When it comes to the success of any new business, you - the business owner - are ultimately the ""secret"" to your success. For many successful business owners, failure was never an option. Armed with drive, determination, and a positive mindset, these individuals view any setback as only an opportunity to learn and grow. Most self-made millionaires possess average intelligence. What sets them apart is their openness to new knowledge and their willingness to learn from their mistakes and move ahead.

If your business does fail, and you realize that you were early to market, or customer preferences have changed, and it is time to move one, do so with grace and humility. Savvy entrepreneurs know that running a company that eventually fails can actually help a career. Even failed businesses yield future networking opportunities and can throw open opportunities to start something new or get into a job that leverages your experience and expertise. There are several venture funds and companies that often seek out the founders and CEOs of failed companies to be on their Board because they value experience over a clean slate. After all, Henry Ford, Steve Jobs, Soichiro Honda and Bill Gates experienced multiple failures before achieving success."

The Central Bureau Of Investigation (CBI) on Saturday filed fresh case about discrepancies in 2G spectrum allocation during BJP leader Pramod Mahajan's tenure. CBI conducted raids at Vodafone office in Mumbai and Airtel office in Gurgaon.

CBI also conducted raids at the residences of former Telecom Secretary Shyamal Ghosh and former director of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) JR Gupta.

The case is a follow up of the Supreme Court ordered preliminary enquiry in which spectrum allocation during tenures of former telecom ministers Mahajan, Arun Shourie and Dayanidhi Maran were being probed.

This is the second FIR in this preliminary enquiry after a case was registered against Maran.

Bharti Artel released a statement after the FIR was filed. The statement read, ""We would like to categorically state that all the spectrum allotted to us from time to time has been strictly as per the stated Government policy. We are providing all details and correspondence to the authorities and shall provide complete support as needed in the matter.""

The CBI in September had submitted its report on Shourie and Maran.

The agency has already filed a case with regard to alleged conspiracy in the Aircel-Maxis deal during the tenure of Maran.

CBI's preliminary enquiry report had indicted the late BJP leader Pramod Mahajan for causing losses to the exchequer and favouring private companies, as telecom minister.

Mahajan had allotted additional spectrum beyond 6.2 MHZ and upto 10 MHZ by charging only additional 1 per cent revenue share.

According to sources Mahajan's decision had caused revenue loss of Rs 565 crores to Department of Telecom (DoT)."

GSM operators' body COAI today said state-run BSNL has disconnected the services of Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular from its network in Maharashtra and Goa circles from last Friday on non-payment of charges.

The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) said BSNL defied the ruling of the appellate tribunal and disconnected PoIs (Points-of-Interconnection that connect networks of telecom operators with each other) of private operators in Maharashtra and Goa circles on Friday, October 14, claiming non-payment of interconnect usage charges (IUC).IUC is paid by one operator to the other for using its network to complete calls and send SMSes.""Private operators continue to suffer in the hands of BSNL as the state-owned telecom service provider continued disconnections in the face of TDSAT orders clearly instructing the organisation to act otherwise,"" COAI said in a statement.It said that the TDSAT order, passed on September 30, had clearly stated that the operators shall continue to pay intra-circle carriage charges to BSNL at the same rate that they had been paying since July, 2010. It further indicatedthat pursuant to compliance of this direction, the disconnections by BSNL may be restored.The association said that BSNL has faced public outrage in several areas recently on having disconnected emergency services, causing harassment to the users and restored the services thereafter.""We expect BSNL to act responsibly in the interest of consumers and take serious consideration of the extreme hardships of the customers due to misguided technicality,"" Rajan S Mathews, Director General, COAI said.He added that private operators have been paying their dues completely as per Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's regulations, and such discriminatory action on part of BSNL is unwarranted.When contacted, a senior official at BSNL did not deny the disconnections and said, ""Operators in question have outstanding dues.""BSNL is claiming outstanding dues of Rs 165 crore for interconnect usage charges (IUC) from the private operators.BSNL is claiming IUC at the rate of 65 paise per minute for such calls from all the private operators. However, the operators are insisting on paying 15 paise per minute.In September, BSNL disconnected PoIs of RCom, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and TTSL in Punjab circle."

Prior to the expiration of the contracts, we had engaged representatives of the Agents and that of the organised Labour on how to manage their transition to our roll.""""Due to a lack of consensus on the way forward and an apparent threat to our facilities by some of the agents, we were compelled to suspend operations at the call centres last Friday, September 30, 2011.""Sources said Airtel operations were not affected with the development.Airtel had entered into an agreement with Tech Mahindra and Spanco in October last year for outsourcing of core customer service functions of African operations.
