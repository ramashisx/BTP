SBI Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara on November 22 said there will be ""moderation"" in the bank's unsecured lending portfolio following the Reserve Bank of India's tightening of norms. He said the impact of higher risk weights will have a 0.02-0.03 per cent impact on its net interest margins in the December quarter, but a better picture will emerge in the next quarter.

""Whatever we were doing, we will continue to do, but there will be a moderation,"" Khara told reporters on the sidelines of a FIBAC event here, when asked about the RBI's tightening of norms. After asking lenders to be cautious, the RBI increased risk weights on unsecured lending for banks as well as non-banks earlier this month.

The RBI has asked lenders to allocate more funds against each risky loan that will result in higher buffers in case of any stress. The move also means personal loans and credit card borrowings will become dearer. Khara said interest rates on such loans will also go up as the cost of funds goes up, pointing out that there will be a capital cost that will have to be borne by the bank because of the new norms.

About any possible change in risk perceptions, Khara said there will not be any change from a diligence perspective and that its norms were already ""robust"". He said the bank's gross non-performing assets from unsecured loans portfolio stands at 0.70 per cent.

Earlier this month, Khara said the bank is not concerned with its unsecured loan portfolio and attributed the strong performance of the portfolio to its strategy of lending to salary account customers or those working for well-rated corporates."

As many as 11 lakh shares changed hands, outpacing the 1-month average of 10 lakh shares.

The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) move to increase the risk weight for banks on consumer loans may impact the State Bank of India's net interest margin (NIM) by 2-3 basis points (bps), Chairman Dinesh Khara said on November 22.

""There will be an impact on NIMs by 2-3 bps in the next quarter,"" Khara said to the media at the FIBAC 2023.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

A profitability indicator, the net interest margin (NIM) is a measure of the amount of money that a bank or a financial institution earns in interest on loans compared to the amount it pays in interest on deposits.

RBI action

On November 16, the central bank raised the risk weight on consumer loans of banks and NBFCs by 25 percent on November 16 to curb the proliferation of unsecured consumer loans.

Earlier, banks attracted a risk weight of 125 percent and NBFCs 100 percent. After the tightening of the norms, the same will stand at 150 percent and 125 percent for banks and NBFCs.

Consumer loans include credit cards, some personal and retail loans. A jump in risk weight means lenders have to set aside higher capital against these loans.

Banks Q2

An analysis of some of the major banks’ earnings report for the Jul-September FY24 quarter showed that banks reported a contraction in their NIMs.

Among major banks, the country’s largest private sector bank, HDFC Bank, reported a net profit of Rs 15,976 crore, a 51 percent YoY jump. At the same time, the country’s largest bank, the State Bank of India (SBI) reported a net profit of Rs 14,330 crore in the July-September FY24 quarter. Whereas, ICICI Bank’s net profit for the quarter stood at Rs 10,261 crore and that of public sector lender, Bank of Baroda (BoB), stood at Rs 4,253 crore."

Earlier, Khara said that the bank does not see any stress in its corporate lending book. ""In our lending book, we do not see any stress in large and mid-corporates. We remain confident of lending further,"" Khara had said after announcing the April-June FY24 quarter results.

Khara also said that the bank is targeting a credit growth of 14 to 15 percent.

India's GDP may have grown by 7.0 percent in the second quarter of 2023-24 - faster than what the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has predicted - according to Soumya Kanti Ghosh, State Bank of India's Group Chief Economic Adviser.

""Domestic economic activity is being supported by robust agricultural performance, sustained buoyancy in services, the boost to investment

from the government's thrust on capital expenditure, above trend capacity utilisation in manufacturing, double digit credit growth, and healthier corporate and bank balance sheets,"" Ghosh said in a report on November 22.

The statistics ministry will release GDP data for the second quarter of 2023-24 at 5:30pm on November 30.

At 7.0 percent, SBI's growth forecast for July-September is 50 basis points higher than the RBI's projection of 6.5 percent. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Growth is expected to exceed the Indian central bank's forecast, with the RBI's economists admitting as much in a recent article where they said there is ""wide consensus"" on the matter.

""The RBI's projections incorporated a turnaround in the momentum of activity into expansion in Q2 and hence the consensus, if actualised, would imply a stronger pace of activity than projected. This optimism appears

to have been corroborated by corporate results for Q2,"" RBI economists said in the monthly State of the Economy article on November 16.

Ghosh, too, noted the performance of Indian companies, saying the July-September saw a 31 percent year-on-year growth in profit after tax, with corporate results being strong and broad-based.

""Further, it is pertinent to mention that corporate margin, which was under pressure in the past year has shown signs of distinct improvement since Q4FY23 (January-March 2023). The EBITDA margin, on an aggregate basis of more than 3,000 companies, improved by 444 basis points to 15.19 percent in Q2FY24 as compared to 10.75 percent in Q2FY23 contributed by low input prices,"" the SBI economist added.

While a GDP growth rate of 7.0 percent in July-September will be lower than the 7.8 percent in the preceding quarter, growth is seen coming down as the favourable base effect caused by the hit to growth from the coronavirus pandemic fades.

Beyond July-September, SBI's Ghosh sees India's GDP growth falling to 6.3 percent and 6.0 percent in the final two quarters of 2023-24. Both these figures are 30 basis points higher than the RBI's official forecast. Consequently, his full-year projection is at 6.7 percent, compared to the RBI's 6.5 percent."

State Bank of India (SBI) will soon launch its banking mobile app Yono Global' in Singapore and the US, offering digitalized remittance and other services to its customers, Vidya Krishnan, Deputy MD (IT), said.

""We are continuing to invest in Yono Global to offer the best services available as we want to give superior experience to our customers,"" Krishnan told PTI at the three-day Singapore Fintech Festival (SFF), which ends on November 17.

Krishnan held talks with Singapore-based digital platform enablers as well as the local regulator and central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).

“We are constantly working on the remittance story between India and Singapore, given the large number of Indian diaspora in the city state.”

Currently, SBI offers Yono Global services in 9 countries, starting with the UK operations in September 2019. SBI’s foreign operations have a total balance sheet size of USD 78 billion.

In Singapore, SBI is integrating its Yono Global app with PayNow and aims to launch it soon.

Meanwhile, speakers at SFF highlighted the importance of emerging technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI) but conceded the need for human touch and feelings in dealing on a person-to-person basis.

Banks are at risk of blowing up in 2-3 years as they chase unsecured credit from unbankable segments, says veteran investor Shankar Sharma. Sharma commented that the big banks are at a size where they need to take more risks to grow. “The Non-Performing Asset (NPA) number of HDFC Bank came out a while ago and we know what kind of reaction that elicited,” Sharma added.

HDFC Bank in its Q2 results, saw its GNPA/NNPA ratios increase marginally to 1.3 percent/0.4 percent due to its merger with HDFC.

Sharma pointed out that banks don’t want to lend to corporates making retail segments, the prime target. “Nobody wants to lend to the corporates. None of the private sector banks are interested in that. Everyone is chasing the retail loan segment. In that, the bankable retail loan is probably done and dusted. So you need to go to unbankable or moderately bankable which is the unsecured part and this has become a larger pie of incremental bank lending.”

Watch the full interview here

Unsecured loans refer to credit cards, personal and microfinance loans. UBS Group had recently flagged the increasing risks in retail unsecured loans for banks. UBS analysts said that unsecured retail loans increase default risk for banks by 50-200 bps. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently raised concerns about a surge in unsecured credit growth and asked banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFC) to enhance their internal surveillance mechanisms.

Sharma said this risk-taking approach makes him uncomfortable as blowups have happened across banks worldwide due to unsecured lending. “We will be no exception. Mark my words. In 2 or 3 years, these same loans will come back to haunt these banks. I will be then around hopefully to pick these banks when the trade is closer to book value,” Sharma added.

Sharma said despite being a fan of the Bajaj Group as they managed an unsecured loan book for a long period, he still has scepticism about how they handle the risk now. “I’ve considered them to be fantastic business people. They are very capital efficient and focused on the bottom line and generating cash flow. That said, when you reach a certain size, you will go off the risk spectrum. Earlier, Bajaj Finance could grow, because the pool of lendable assets was there. Maybe now they are getting close to the ceiling of that. We'll see. I hope they defy my scepticism.” Sharma said.

However, it seems like banks are unfazed by their growing unsecured loans. The largest public bank in India, State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Dinesh Khara said they are not concerned with their unsecured loans during their September quarterly result announcement."

Shares of State Bank of India (SBI) were trading flat on November 6 after the bank's fiscal second-quarter earnings beat the Street estimates with the net profit rising 8 percent on-year to Rs 14,330 crore, riding on lower loan loss provisions, even as it made higher provisioning towards wage revisions. Analysts believe that the public sector bank has levers to achieve guided growth rates.

At 9:26 am, SBI shares were trading marginally higher at Rs 578.45 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

For the quarter ended September 2023, SBI saw healthy growth in net interest income (NII) because of resilient net interest margin (NIM). Its NII rose 12 percent, while gross non-performing asset (NPA) fell 3.52 percent YoY. However, the sharp increase in provisions for employee expenses resulted in a big miss on pre-provision operating profit. PPOP measures profit before provisions for loan losses and other non-operating items.

Analysts are positive on the SBI stock, given that its slippages declined after a seasonal bump in Q1, along with healthy recoveries, and write-offs. Its asset quality remained robust as the net NPA ratio improved further and the restructured book remained in control. Investec expects, NIMs to compress by 4-5 bps in the next quarter as liabilities get completely repriced.

Should you buy, hold or sell SBI shares?

Investec has a 'buy' rating on the SBI stock with a target price of Rs 640 per share. At a domestic cash deposit ratio of 64 percent and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 145 percent, the company has levers to achieve guided credit growth rates of 12-14 percent, it said. SBI is also likely to sustain NIMs at current levels.

Following another steady quarter, international brokerage Bernstein has an 'Outperform' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 710 per share.

Analysts at Motilal Oswal broadly maintained their estimates as higher wage provisioning gets offset by controlled credit costs. The domestic brokerage firm estimates the FY25 Return on Asset (RoA) at 1.1 percent and the Return on Equity (RoE) at 18.3 percent. It reiterated its 'buy' call on the stock with an unchanged target price of Rs 700.

Nuvama Institutional Equities also remains bullish on SBI, given that management retained its growth guidance even as it expects some pressure on margins owing to an increase in the cost of deposits. The brokerage firms maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock, and retained the target price at Rs 705. Macroeconomic risk is the most significant risk for SBI, given its size and exposures, it said, adding that margins and credit cost remain key monitorables.

State Bank of India is likely to report a subdued quarter when it announces its earnings on November 4, with analysts expecting net interest income (NII) to fall on-year on account of pressure on net interest margins. The public sector lender's profit after tax, however, is expected to rise on-year.

While SBI's credit costs may remain stable, asset quality is expected to improve.

SBI's net interest income is likely to fall 8 percent on-year to Rs 38,020 crore in the second quarter as net interest margins (NIM) contract and the cost of deposits catch up, according to the average estimate of seven brokerages.

NIM is the difference between interest income from assets and interest expenses incurred on liabilities. It measures the effectiveness of a company’s investment decisions.

The lender’s net profit is expected to rise by 7 percent on-year to Rs 14,221 crore. Sequentially, profit may fall 15 percent on the back of lower treasury gains and an uptick in provisions due to a low base in the first quarter and prudential provisioning.

Provisions refer to funds set aside to cover potential losses or expenses likely to be incurred in the future. Treasury gains for a bank typically refer to income generated through treasury or investment activities. Increased investment is expected to result in higher operating expenses.

PPOP seen declining

SBI's pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) is expected to decline 19 percent YoY to Rs 20,244 crore due to higher operating expenses and lower treasury income. PPOP represents profit before accounting for provisions for loan losses and other non-operating items.

According to analysts, despite some pressure, NIMs are expected to remain largely stable, given the structure of the loan book and the negligible need for deposits to fund this growth. SBI's provisions, however, will be higher sequentially.

Recoveries to be positive

Analysts at Kotak Securities expect slippages to represent approximately 1.5 percent of loans in this quarter, with a reduced impact from priority sector lending compared to the previous quarter. However, recoveries and upgrades are likely to be good in the September quarter.

The brokerage said credit costs may rise marginally as the portfolio starts to normalise.

Asset quality to improve

Brokerages expect loan growth to gain momentum as systemwide credit growth picks up. Phillip Capital said the lender may make provisions for wage revision at Rs 480 crore per month.

SBI's asset quality is seen improving, supported by a low-stressed asset pool. The lender's advances are likely to grow 11-14 percent YoY on a larger base.

The key focus areas in the results include NIM, return on equity, unsecured loans, capital adequacy ratio, asset quality outlook and loan book traction.

India's largest public sector lender, State Bank of India ( SBI), received Rs 80,886 crores worth of Rs 2,000 notes till September 30, 2023, the bank replied to an RTI filed by Moneycontrol.

SBI also added that of these, Rs 14,079 crore were received as exchange and Rs 66,807 crore through deposits.

To a query on which segment the bank has received the maximum notes from, SBI replied, ""The information from which retail or from business has not compiled in the ordinary course of business this information is not centrally available, ""the bank replied.

On May 19, the Central Bank announced the withdrawal of Rs 2,000 currency bills from circulation, citing it as part of its clean-note policy, and advised banks to stop issuing the bills with immediate effect. ""In pursuance of the 'Clean Note Policy' of the RBI, it has been decided to withdraw the Rs 2,000 denomination banknotes from circulation,"" the RBI had said.

According to the last RBI release of September 30, 2023, about 96 percent of the Rs 2,000 banknotes in circulation as of May 19, 2023, have been returned.

The RBI, citing data received from banks, said that of the total value of Rs 3.56 lakh crore of Rs 2, 000 banknotes in circulation as of May 19, 2023, Rs 3.42 lakh crore have been returned, leaving only Rs 0.14 lakh crore in circulation as of the close of business on September 29, 2023.

However, on October 20, RBI Governor, Shaktikanta Das, exuded confidence that all the remaining Rs 2,000 notes would be exchanged or deposited. “Rs 2,000 notes are coming back and only Rs 10,000 crore is left in the system. The expectation is that the amount will also come back,” he said on the sidelines of an event in New Delhi.

Recently, Moneycontrol reported that brazen middlemen, operating right outside the RBI office in the National Capital, are making a killing from ‘customers’ seeking to exchange the Rs 2,000 notes, charging as much as Rs 400 per bill.

The deadline to exchange the withdrawn notes at bank branches ended on October 7, but the facility is still available at RBI offices, which have drawn long queues of people who couldn’t deposit or exchange their notes earlier.

There is a limit of Rs 20,000 per person to exchange these notes.

Sensing a business opportunity, the interlopers have deployed several people to stand in queues to exchange these notes. They accept a large quantity of such notes from prospective customers and pay them the amount out of bags of money ready at hand after deducting Rs 300-400 per note. Customers who don’t want to stand in long queues multiple times don’t mind paying the commission to the middlemen."

Electric vehicle manufacturing major Ola Electric announced on October 26 that it has closed a Rs 3,200 crore (approximately $380 million) funding round with a mix of debt and equity from Temasek-led prominent investors and debt from the State Bank of India (SBI).

The funds raised will be used to expand Ola's EV business and to set up India's first lithium-ion cell manufacturing facility in Krishnagiri, Tamil Nadu, the firm said in a statement.

“We are committed to developing core technologies in EVs and cell and are rapidly scaling up manufacturing to further accelerate the transition to sustainable mobility,” said founder and chief executive officer Bhavish Aggarwal.

The fundraising was part of Ola's plans to raise around $300-$400 million ahead of its public listing plans. The funding took place in multiple rounds, and in September, the EV maker closed $140 million in funding from Temasek. The remaining $240 million through debt from SBI.

Ola Electric also raised $200 million from Tekne Private Ventures, Edelweiss and others in January this year.

Moneycontrol had earlier reported that Ola Electric has roped in Kotak Mahindra Capital and Goldman Sachs to manage its initial public offering (IPO) in early 2024. At the time, sources said the planned IPO will be a combination of primary and secondary share offerings.

Meanwhile, Ola Electric's close rival, Ather, on September 6, said that the firm has raised Rs 900 crore from its existing investors, Hero MotoCorp and GIC, through a rights issue.

Ola Electric, which has a manufacturing capacity of 1 million electric vehicles per annum in Krishnagiri, Tamilnadu, is planning to double its capacity.

""In the next six to nine months, our total manufacturing capacity will go up to 2 million from the present 1 million per annum. The capacity we have right now can be expanded up to 10 million per annum and that is our ultimate goal,"" Aggarwal said in an earlier interaction.

The firm is planning to make motorcycles within the same facility and has set up a separate battery manufacturing unit which is in the process of making India's first lithium-ion cells.

""We have also set up a plan that is researching and making lithium-ion cells. The plan is to make 5 Gwh of cell capacity in phase 1, and we will slowly expand that,"" Aggarwal said.

Ola Electric saw its losses widen around 293 percent to Rs 784 crore in FY22 as against a loss of Rs 199 crore last year as its expenses zoomed to Rs 1,240 crore. The company’s expenses have gone up by around 306 percent year-on-year (YoY).

The firm reported consolidated revenue from operations of Rs 373 crore in FY22, up nearly 400 times year-on-year (YoY) against the revenue reported last financial year at Rs 0.86 crore as it began selling its two-wheeler during December 2021."

The Nifty Bank index shed nearly 1 percent on October 13, led by losses in Axis Bank and SBI after the lenders were downgraded by UBS.

While Axis Bank fell more than 2 percent, SBI shares were down 1.5 percent intraday on the NSE after the international brokerage house lowered their ratings on concerns of a rise in credit losses. ""Indian banking sector's risk-reward is turning equal,"" UBS said.

""We raise our credit cost forecasts for the India banks we cover by 5-10bps in FY25,"" UBS said in its report, adding that SBI and Axis Bank's Return on Assets (RoAs) are more sensitive to credit cost changes than large peers. The brokerage estimates FY25 EPS for SBI and Axis Bank at 22 percent and 10 percent below consensus.

SBI downgraded on narrow margins, rising credit costs

From the 'buy' rating, UBS has downgraded SBI to 'sell', and cut the target price to Rs 530 from Rs 740 as it raised credit costs by 10bps and cut the EPS by 5 percent. The downgrade is attributed to anticipated declines in RoA and Return on Equity (RoE) by FY25. The bank's narrowing margins and increasing credit costs are seen driving these potential declines.

Follow out market blog to catch all the live action

Considering relatively low CET1 versus peers, potential regulatory tightening on unsecured loans would limit loan growth or trigger dilution for SBI. The stock at one-time FY25 price to book value does not appear expensive but a likely decline in profitability may result in downside, analysts at UBS noted. The brokerage warns that SBI could face escalating credit costs, and its ability to manage these costs while maintaining profitability will be crucial in the coming years.

Limited upside seen in Axis Bank

The Axis Bank stock has been downgraded to 'neutral' and its price target has been lowered to Rs 1,100 from Rs 1,150. The private lender's margins are peaking and credit costs are near bottom. Its RoA is set to to contract in FY25, said UBS. In the next three quarter, single-digit growth is expected in net interest income (NII). The brokerage sees limited upside potential in the stock.

In the last one year, the Axis Bank stock has risen around 24 percent, outperforming the Nifty Bank index which has risen 14 percent during this period. Public sector lender SBI has underperformed Nifty Bank in the past year, rising around 10 percent.

The Nifty Bank index is trading at 1.9x one-year forward P/BV, below its 2.2x 10-year average. While valuation seems inexpensive to UBS analysts, they see limited scope of a re-rating, considering expectations of slowing earnings growth, owing to potential NIM compression and an uptick in credit cost. It also sees increasing default risks in retail unsecured loans, which is likely to push up banks' credit losses by 50-200bps. The risk of regulatory tightening is high, it said.

India’s share market outperformed global and other emerging markets in the past six months by a notable margin and the structural trend remains positive, analysts at Axis Securities said.

According to the brokerage, India’s economy stands at the sweet spot of growth and remains the land of stability against the backdrop of a volatile global economy.

""We continue to believe in its long-term growth story, supported by the emerging favourable structure as increasing capex enables banks to improve credit growth. Thus, we maintain our December 2023 Nifty target at 20,200,” Axis Securities said.

The Nifty 50 fell 0.5 percent to 19,436.10 at the close on October 4.

According to Axis Securities, the current level of the India VIX, the volatility index that indicates how rapidly and unpredictably the Nifty 50 is expected to change in the next 30 days, is below its long-term average, suggesting the market is in a neutral zone. While the medium- to long-term outlook for the overall market remains positive, volatility is expected in the short run, with the market responding in either direction.

""Keeping this in view, the current setup is a ‘Buy on Dips’ market. We recommend investors maintain good liquidity (10 percent) to use any dips in a phased manner and build a position in high-quality companies (where the earnings visibility is quite high) with an investment horizon of 12-18 months,” it added.

Midcap and small-cap vs. large-cap

In the month gone by, the broader midcap and small-cap markets outperformed large-caps by notable margins. With the strong catch-up by midcaps and small-caps, the brokerage said the current margin of safety in certain pockets has reduced compared to large-caps. Keeping this in view, the broader market may see some time correction in the near term and flows may shift to large-caps.

""Nonetheless, the long-term story of the broader Indian market continues to remain attractive,"" Axis Securities said in its report.

Axis Securities is ‘overweight’ on automobiles, banking and telecom, and ‘equal weight’ on capital goods, cement, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, IT, metals and mining, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, real estate and speciality chemicals.

According to the brokerage, the theme ‘Growth at a Reasonable Price’ looks attractive on account of robust growth expectations, a cooling-off in commodity prices and inflation, rural recovery, and expectations of margin recovery in the upcoming quarters.

Selected value stocks from the PSU, metals, commodities, utility, and cement sectors are well-placed to deliver superior performance.

“Indecision has probably cost investors more than bad judgment.” ~Arthur Zeikel

The struggle for bulls continues. The downbeat mood in global markets, rising crude prices, and persistent selling by foreign funds is tempering the excitement to some extent. The long term story is good, maintain investors, but then even the fiercest of bull markets need a breather. Focus is gradually shifting to second quarter earnings. Given the spate of order wins over the last couple quarters, capex related firms should report strong numbers, but how much of it is already priced in remains the question.

Mid and small caps continue to find takers, the stock exchanges’ latest curbs have not dampened sentiment beyond a handful of stocks. You will need to find new naysayers, because the old naysayers have turned believers, one small cap bull told Short Call.

Colgate

The stock hit a 52-week high on Tuesday, September 26, and is now among the best performing FMCG stock in 2023 so far with a 33-percent gain. Street is still divided on whether the company deserves a re-rating. Skeptics of Colgate have pointed out that the strong first quarter numbers came off a low base. The recent rally seems to suggest that some bulls are betting on the company repeating the performance. Last month, Short Call had pointed out Colgate’s dilemma: one half of analysts thinking aggressive spending won’t help grow market share, and the other half thinking it was the only way to increase market share.

SBI Cards

Trading volumes were at a four month high, but the stock slipped to a 4-month low. This is despite the company gaining market share in August, and overall credit card spends rising 2.7 percent. However, there are challenges for the credit industry, as market share of credit card spend vs total spend (including debit cards, UPI) has moderated over time, points out HSBC

Tata Steel

Steel demand remains strong across sectors in India, Tata Steel boss TV Narendran tells CNBCTV18. He expects steel prices to be strong, but at the same time said that “things are fragile internationally.” Uncertainty over a demand recovery in export markets is what has so far tempered bulls’ enthusiasm for steel stocks.

IT

Concerns over a slowdown in the US have turned out to be overblown as far as the sector is concerned but analysts are still reluctant to give an ‘all-clear’ signal for IT stocks. Improving margin and double-digit EPS growth should keep valuations afloat, says Morgan Stanley, and has raised its price targets for the stocks in its coverage list. According to Morgan Stanley, the outlook for 2024-25 growth is strong. That is contrary to predictions by a section of forecasters that the US economy will start showing strains of high interest rates some time in 2024.

Crude

As crude oil prices rose, traders started building bullish bets expecting the rally to continue. That in turn played a part in pushing up crude prices higher, besides other factors. But now the bullish bets have piled up to a point where that itself could put pressure on prices in the short term, according to a report in oilprice.com.

Interest rates

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari thinks there’s nearly a 50-50 chance that interest rates will need to move significantly higher to bring down inflation, reports CNBC. Stocks have been struggling of late on concerns of interest rates remaining higher for longer. High interest rates will lead to a stronger dollar, making imports more expensive for emerging markets at a time of rising crude prices.

His fund is going short on stocks of companies with fake green claims and unrealistic valuations. “The great shorts just happen to be in the ESG space,” he told Bloomberg, adding that capital was plenty but good ideas were few.

There is a shift in financial savings from households towards physical assets like housing in the past two years, triggered by recovery in the real estate sector and low interest rate regime during the pandemic. This change in savings behaviour can have significant policy implications, particularly concerning growth and the revitalisation of investments, according to the State Bank of India’s Economic Research Department’s report, SBI Ecowrap.

“On the liability side of households, out of Rs 8.2 billion increase, Rs 7.1 billion was accounted for by increase in household borrowing from commercial banks. Juxtaposing this increase in borrowing from commercial banks with the increase in bank credit, we find that 55 percent of the retail credit to households in the last two years have gone to housing, education and vehicle purchase,” it said.

This clearly indicates that the shift from financial savings to physical savings was also triggered by a low interest rate regime in the pandemic.

“We also believe that the shift to physical assets is also triggered by a recovery in the real estate sector and the increase in property prices. The RBI House Price Index shows a modest acceleration since FY21, which may be acting as a motivator for buying homes. This increased ‘pull’ factor thereby pushing up capital spends in a multitude of sectors. If this is indeed the proximate story of the revival in household investment, this has strong policy implications for growth and investment revival,” the report mentioned.

There is a significant long run relationship between housing loans and household savings in physical assets. Every Re 1 increase in Housing loans has resulted in Rs 2.12 increase in household’s savings in physical assets for the 14 year period ended FY22.

The decline in net financial savings of households has resulted in a concomitant increase in household savings in gross physical assets. The trend is again shifting and the share of physical assets is expected to reach approximately 70 percent level in FY23, due to decline in share of financial assets. We believe that the total household savings – both financial and physical – for FY23 would still surpass the FY22 levels despite the decline in financial savings as household savings in physical assets has jumped Rs 6.5 lakh crore in FY22 over FY21 and as per current trends it is expected to jump further by up to Rs 5 lakh crore in FY23 and hence will outstrip the increase in household indebtedness,” according to the report.

The net financial saving of the household sector – the most important source of funds for the two deficit sectors, namely, the general government sector and the non-financial corporations – moderated to 5.1 percent of GDP in FY23 from 11.5 percent in FY21 and 7.6 percent from pre-pandemic year FY20.

“It has been said that it fell to a 50 year low, however this is completely misleading as household savings must be looked into as a sum total of physical and financial savings. Financial liabilities jumped Rs 8.2 trillion since pandemic, outpacing the increase in gross financial savings at Rs 6.7 lakh crore, thus explaining the fall in household net financial savings by Rs 1.5 trillion / 2.5 percent of GDP. On the asset side of households, there was an increase of Rs 4.1 lakh crore in insurance and provident and pension funds,” it said.

The shift to physical assets has an interesting policy connotation. Household sector investment gradually recovered to reach 11.8 percent in FY22. It is pertinent to note that there has been an increase in capital formation as a percentage of household gross savings to 60 percent in FY22 from a low of 47.8 percent in FY21. Thus, households have now started utilising more of their savings for capital formation. This number is expected to increase further to a decade high of approximately 68 percent in FY23, the report stated."

The nation's largest lender State Bank of India is adopting a novel way to ensure timely repayments, especially by its retail borrowers, by greeting those likely to default on monthly installments with a pack of chocolates.

According to the bank, it has been found that a borrower who is planning to default will not answer a reminder call from the bank. So the best way is to meet them at their homes unannounced.

The move, aimed at ensuring better collections, comes amidst rising level of retail lending in the system coupled with increasing delinquency levels on the back of the upward movement in the interest rates.

SBI's retail loan book grew over 16.46 per cent to Rs 12,04,279 crore in the June 2023 quarter from Rs 10,34,111 crore in the year-ago period, making it the largest asset class for the lender whose total book stood at Rs 33,03,731 crore, growing at 13.9 per cent on-year.

In fact for the entire system, the double-digit loan growth of around 16 per cent has been led by retail loans only.

""With two fintechs which use artificial intelligence, we are piloting a novel way of reminding our retail borrowers of their repayment obligations. While one is doing conciliation with borrowers, the other is alerting us on the propensity of a borrower to default. And to such borrowers who are likely to default, the representatives from this fintech will visit them, carrying a pack of chocolates for each of them, and remind them of the forthcoming EMIs,"" Ashwini Kumar Tewari, managing director in-charge of risk, compliance and stressed assets at SBI, said here over the weekend.

According to Tewari, this novel method of carrying a pack of chocolates and personally visiting them is adopted because it has been found that a borrower who is planning to default will not answer a reminder call from the bank. So the best way is to meet them at their own homes unannounced and surprise them. And so far, the success rate has been overwhelming, he said.

Tewari refused to name the fintechs saying the move is just at the pilot stage and has been put into place just about 15 days back and ""if successful, we will formally announce it"".

""We are also talking to a few other fintechs to improve our collection efficiencies and hopefully by the end of the year, we will have formally tied up with at least half of them,"" he said, adding, ""we want to continue the pilot for at least four to five months."" SBI's over Rs 12 lakh crore of retail book consists of personal, auto, home and education loans. With a home loan book of over Rs 6.3 lakh crore as of June, SBI is the largest mortgage lender too."

Banking, finance, and select infrastructure stocks were the runaway favourites of analysts in August as robust credit growth, stable asset quality, and a virtuous capex cycle burnished their appeal.

Banking and finance counters were the stars of the Q1 results season, and the optimism is reflected in Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for August.

More than half of the companies with the most optimism score or with the maximum upgrades belong to the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) space.

In contrast, the gloom-and-doom narrative continued around the information technology sector, which had to endure a sombre Q1 earnings season marred by an uncertain demand environment due to recessionary headwinds in the West.

India’s largest lender SBI leads the chart in terms the most ‘buy’ calls in the month at 47.

Not without reason.

SBI posted its highest-ever quarterly earnings at Rs 16,884 crore for Q1 FY24, soaring 178 percent on-year, though net interest income came in below estimates at Rs 38,905 crore.

Analyst Call Tracker: Sluggish demand, unclear debt reduction target push UPL into a pool of downgrades

The management continues to remain optimistic on credit delivery through revamped buildout in SME, steady growth in retail, and existing pipeline in corporate loans.

“However, with pressure on NIMs (net interest margins) in a rising competitive environment and limited headroom on MCLR repricing, SBI needs to ramp up other avenues of productivity (fee income and lower opex)…,” domestic brokerage HDFC Securities said.

In fact, the pressure on net interest margin was the fly in the ointment for the sector as a whole.

While the RBI has been on a rate hike pause, banks are facing increasing pressure of hiking interest rates further to chase depositors. Moreover, since most of their loan book has been already repriced (more than half of it is linked to external benchmark lending rate (EBLR)), analysts expect the resultant squeeze in margins to weigh on banks’ balance sheets at least for this fiscal.

“The delayed pass-through of monetary-policy rate[1]hikes in deposit rates versus lending rates, coupled with faster growth in credit versus deposits, has resulted in a near 50bp contraction in spreads between lending and deposit rates for the banking system. This is likely to lead to compression of net interest margins for the banking system in FY24 versus FY23,” AnandRathi said in a note.

But the good news is that robust credit demand, which underpins the domestic consumption engine, limits the downside for banks.

“We remain optimistic on medium-term credit growth and expect sector credit to grow 13% y-y in FY24F and FY25F, respectively. We continue to view the banking sector favourably on its strong RoE, reasonable valuations and low imminent risks to earnings,” analysts at foreign brokerage firm Nomura said.

Private sector lenders HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and IndusInd Bank all scored over 40 ‘buy’ calls each, reflecting the consensus view on the sector.

Macro Strength

Infrastructure companies were the other top picks of analysts in August, with NTPC, Adani Ports and SEZ and L&T leading the pack.

The government’s focus on infrastructure development, coupled with rising state governments’ and private sector capex, has added sheen to the sector’s near-term outlook.

“Order inflow momentum remains strong and broad-based while some pockets are witnessing moderation on a high base of last year. While government capex continues to remain the major driver, some greenshoots of private capex are visible in traditional as well as new age industries (such as data centres, green energy),” Yes Securities said.

Analyst call tracker: Despite rise in downgrades, market leader UltraTech continues to charm

Most infra firms reported healthy order wins and a strong deal pipeline. Managements also gave out favourable guidance.

For example, engineering and construction major L&T expects revenue to increase 12-15 percent and order inflow to grow 10-12 percent in FY24.

In 1QFY24, consolidated revenue increased 33.6 percent YoY to Rs 47,882 crore, driven by strong growth in infrastructure projects, up 55.5 percent YoY to Rs. 22,396 crore.

“The company’s growing order inflows and order prospects pipeline will support performance in the future. Strong revenue, focus on cash generation, and sound capital allocation are expected to aid the company’s profitability,” analysts at Geojit said.

Pain Points

The Indian IT majors dominate the pessimism list for the month.

The sector as a whole is grappling with the fallout of global macroeconomic challenges, as record high interest rates take a toll on economies in the West and fan recession fears.

The top five Indian IT companies (by market capitalisation) have seen their sequential revenue growth on a constant currency basis at anywhere between -2.8 percent and 1 percent, a far cry from the high single-digit and double-digit growth seen last year. The biggest shocker, however, was Infosys’ sharp guidance cut for the year from 4-7 percent to 1-3.5 percent.

However, Wipro emerged as the company with the most ‘sell’ calls at 18.

The IT services company reported a net profit of Rs 2,870 crore in the first quarter. Though the bottomline was up around 12 percent on year, it fell 6.6 percent on a sequential basis, largely due to a decline across all major financial metrics. The net profit also lagged the Street's estimate of Rs 2,976 crore.

Revenue grew 6 percent on year to Rs 22,831 crore but that too missed estimate of Rs 23,014 crore. Sequentially, the topline was up 1.6 percent from Rs 23,176 crore seen in the previous quarter.

On top of that, the company rolled out a revenue growth guidance of -2 percent to 1 percent in constant currency terms for the July-September quarter on the back of a challenging macro environment.

Morgan Stanley highlighted that the deceleration in Wipro's revenue growth was much steeper than its peers. The firm believes that until Wipro manages to narrow that gap, its P/E discount will likely remain higher as compared to its peers.

Wipro’s Q1FY24 performance missed estimates on all fronts, ICICI Securities noted. EBIT missed Bloomberg estimates by 4 percent, orderbook was weak (down 10 percent QoQ), and revenue growth guidance for Q2 FY24 too fell short of expectations.

“Management commentary did not provide any visibility of pickup in demand ahead,” ICICI Securities added.

While the domestic IT firms tried to put on a brave face during their earning concalls by talking about their increasing focus on generative AI, analysts attributed this more to bluster than substance at the moment.

Another notable name in this list is Asian Paints -- another casualty of the rising competitive intensity in the aftermath of Grasim’s entry into the segment.

“The worst of margin pangs seem behind (for Asian Paints). It, however, will jostle with hard revenue growth comps in FY24. This, coupled with rising competitive intensity, could mean that the pricing lever may remain out of play,” analysts at HDFC Securities added.

State Bank of India's mobile banking app Yono will be available in four more countries in the next one year, a senior official said on September 6.

Currently, the app is available in nine countries — Britain, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Canada, Mauritius, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka and South Africa.

""We will be expanding the global footprint of Yono across more geographies and streamline the user experience. The next in line will be the US, Singapore and Oman to begin with and over the next 12 months it will be available in 13 countries,"" Chella Sreenivasulu Setty, Managing Director – international banking at SBI, said.

He did not mention the 13th country where the app will be made available.

He was speaking at the Global Fintech Fest here.

On Tuesday, SBI Chairman Dinesh Khara said the nation's largest lender, which is into the 217th year of operations, launched the app in 2014 and since then it has gone onto become such a runaway success that as much as 85 per cent of banking transactions are done through Yono.

Khara had also said the bank was working on the next generation Yono or Yono 2.0.

Banks and financial institutions must promote research on the use of artificial intelligence to ease their workload, an official from India’s largest lender said, as automation evolves from handling basic customer queries to facilitating more complex transactions such as digital payments.

“There is a need to promote more AI research and researchers in the banking and finance sector,” Balaji Rajagopalan, chief technical officer at the State Bank of India, told Moneycontrol on the sidelines of the Global Fintech Festival in Mumbai on September 5. He explained that advances in AI technology can facilitate and ease manual workloads at banks and financial institutions.

Many banks have introduced chatbots on their websites and apps that are used mainly for basic communication and handling customer queries. ICICI Bank’s chatbot, called iPal, guides visitors on the website to service options. HDFC Bank’s Eva chatbot assists website visitors with complaints and other services.

As the capability of chatbots advances, regulators are bringing in norms that will allow more complex transactions to be automated. The Reserve Bank of India proposed in August enabling conversational AI-based payments on UPI. This will allow users to talk to AI-powered systems to make payments.

UPI, or United Payments Interface, is a platform that facilitates instant money transfers between bank accounts.

Core issues

The State Bank of India has set up institutional centres to develop AI products. Bank of Baroda has introduced gadgets and machines at its branches to provide account details and offer other services.

Meanwhile, Axis Bank may look at using ChatGPT’s enterprise version, said Sameer Shetty, president and head of digital business and transformation at the private lender.

“We may look forward to working on use cases to enhance communication with customers using ChatGPT’s enterprise version,” Shetty told Moneycontrol.

ChatGPT is an AI chatbot that responds to queries based on the information it is given and the vast amount of data that it’s been trained on. It interacts with users in a conversational way. Global banks JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank plan to use ChatGPT-like chatbots and AI models.

Lately, banks have faced issues with their digital offerings such as disruptions in internet banking or app-based transactions. Experts said these problems lie mainly in their core systems.

Rajagopalan said SBI has evaluated these problems and is working on revamping its technology – from the core system to the front-end model. However, there is a scarcity of the talent required, he said.

""We are constantly looking for and hiring talent in the technical banking space, but there is some struggle to get hardcore tech officers,"" Rajagopalan said."

The State Bank of India's (SBI) ""You Only Need One"" (YONO) is evolving into a digital bank within the bank, according to Chairman Dinesh Khara. He made this announcement at the Global Fintech Festival in Mumbai on September 5.

SBI launched YONO as its digital banking platform in 2017 to serve its 400 million customers. The concept of creating a super mobile app that encompasses all banking services and features, including e-commerce shopping, stemmed from the bank's ambition to establish a digital marketplace aimed at attracting a younger clientele.

Furthermore, Khara revealed that YONO generates a quarterly income of Rs 100 crore solely through third-party fees and commissions.

""We generate a quarterly income of Rs 100 crore through our YONO platform from fees and commissions associated with third-party product offerings,"" Khara stated.

Khara also emphasized that YONO has the potential to amass a book of Rs 30,000 crore through lending and other business activities.

The lender, had in July 2023 launched a revamped version of YONO. It launched a multitude of unified payments interface (UPI) facilities, including scan and pay, pay by contacts, request money, and other facilities. The new version of the app also worked on improving the existing technical issues.

Khara's current term as SBI chief is scheduled to conclude in October. If his term is extended by another 10 months, he would continue as the bank's chairman till August 2024, by when he would attain the age of 63. As per SBI's norms, the chairman should retire on turning 63 years old.

Khara, a career banker, had taken over as the chairman of SBI in October 2020 for a three-year period. Prior to being elevated at the bank's helm, he was functioning as its managing director (global banking and subsidiaries). His stint at the SBI began in 1984, when he joined as a Probationary Officer.

""At SBI, we have developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model with 30 high-frequency indicators… On the basis of the ANN model, we forecast that the quarterly GDP growth for the Q1FY24 (April-June 2023) would be at 8.3 percent,"" Ghosh said in a report on August 22.

At 8.3 percent, SBI's growth forecast for April-June will be the highest in four quarters. The economy had expanded by 13.1 percent in April-June 2022 due to a favourable base effect. This effect is still in play, but gradually fading away.

Ghosh sees signs of rapid growth in corporate results too, noting that April-June saw Indian companies post profit after tax of PAT of more than 30 percent.

""Further, it is pertinent to mention that corporate margin, which was under pressure for the last few quarters, has shown signs of improvement since Q4FY23 (January-March 2023).

""We are happy to share that the last tranche of the securities, forming part of FTMF wound up debt schemes, has been liquidated as part of the above mandate given to us,"" SBI Funds said.

The six schemes had collective assets under management of Rs 25,215 crore, when the decision to close the funds was announced.

The schemes were Franklin India Low Duration Fund, Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund, Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, Franklin India Short Term Income Plan, Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund, and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund. PTI SP HVA"

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on August 21 deferred to August 29, the hearing of State Bank of India's (SBI) plea seeking insolvency proceedings against PC Jeweller.

The case was adjourned after PC Jeweller sought more time to file a response to SBI's plea.

On August 2, the NCLT first sought PC Jeweller's response to SBI's plea.

SBI's insolvency plea first came up for hearing on July 26, the tribunal issued notice in the case and listed the case for further consideration on August 2. PC Jeweller entered an appearance in the case today and sought time to file a response, and the tribunal accordingly deferred the hearing in the case.

PC Jeweller's troubles began in February 2023, when banks decided to recall loans advanced to it after it was revealed in a filing that the company had defaulted on loans worth Rs 3,466 crore from banks and financial institutions. A loan recall is a process where the source lender requests the return of the amount advanced to the recipient or borrower.

Generally, when lenders see problems in a borrower’s financial situation, they decide to recall loans.

The company, in its annual report for fiscal year 2021-22, stated that it had borrowed money from 14 banks, including SBI, Indian Bank, Union Bank and Punjab National Bank.

In the annual report, the company said it owed the banks Rs 3,278 crore, which included the interest and the base amount.

The largest lenders are SBI, with Rs 1,060 crore outstanding; Union Bank of India, with Rs 530 crore; Punjab National Bank, with Rs 478 crore; and Indian Bank, with Rs 226 crore.

The company has also found itself in trouble with the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) over insider trading allegations. On February 2 this year, SEBI had sought a clarification from PC Jeweller on its price movement in the market, after the company’s shares fell from Rs 48 at the start of the trading session to Rs 43.50 at the end of the session."

The State Bank of India (SBI) has offered to extend relief on loans to its customers in Manipur, who have been affected by the ongoing unrest in the state.

The relief package includes a moratorium of up to 12 months on equated monthly installments (EMIs), interest payments, and other installments. It will be available to borrowers whose accounts had not turned non-performing assets (NPAs) as on May 3, 2023, a SBI Manipur regional office notice said.

The package will be implemented based on an assessment date of May 4, 2023. Borrowers who are interested in availing relief must approach their home branches or any nearby SBI branch by August 31, 2023, the bank said.

The SBI said it understands the challenges that individuals and businesses are facing in Manipur at this time, and the relief package is aimed at providing them with much-needed support.

""The SBI's relief package is a welcome move for borrowers in Manipur who have been affected by the unrest. The moratorium on EMIs and interest payments will provide them with much-needed breathing space, and help them to manage their finances as normal life and economic activities have taken a setback, an official said."

State Bank of India, the country’s largest bank, on August 4 declared a 178 percent growth in net profit at 16,884 crore for the April-June FY24 quarter from Rs 6,068 crore last year.

In a post-results media conference, Chairman Dinesh Khara highlighted that the bank is looking at a credit growth of 15 percent and deposit growth of 13 percent in FY24.

Khara also said that the lender has a Rs 3.5 lakh crore credit pipeline in place for lending to corporates in the current financial year. Here are the details from the session.

On CASA

The fall in the CASA (current account and savings account) ratio is perhaps a trend in the banking industry. All other banks have also witnessed this.

And as far as we are concerned, the drop in CASA is much lower compared to what the competition has seen.

Our effort would be to improve the CASA with the current account component, because when it comes to savings, these days with the kind of product variants available, people normally sweep their balances. As the economy develops, this is the tendency which will be seen.

On recoveries

In the April-June FY24 quarter, the bank recorded recoveries of about Rs 1,200 crore, whereas last year around the same quarter, this was Rs 500 crore more. We had some reasonably higher value of recoveries last year and now that the stock left out is not all that big a number, and that is a reason why recoveries are being affected.

On asset quality

Underwriting is a very important component on the retail side of business and we have worked well on it. Also, we have a very robust control and follow-up mechanism. So that is nothing but the effective machinery on the ground to make the recoveries.

Slippages are not coming from the running accounts. And for that matter, even the stock of our stressed portfolio has also come down significantly.

Corporate, retail and SMEs (small and medium enterprises) do not have anything. Some slippages have come from SME and agri, and there also we could pull back a significant portion.

Also read: Don’t see any stress in SBI’s corporate loan book: Chairman Dinesh Khara

On credit and deposit growth

We are looking at a 14 to 15 percent credit growth. Currently, we recorded a growth of 13.90 percent. Our international book will be very selective and we may not grow as we would be growing in the domestic market for the simple reason that the international markets are very, very choppy, and we can take care of the quality of the risk.

We are looking at growing in retail, SME and also into agri. And when it comes to corporate, we are open to all kinds of opportunities, maybe renewable, maybe services, maybe infrastructure like roads, construction, but it should meet our risk appetite.

On the deposit growth front, we have grown at 12 percent and we'll try to inch it up further, maybe to the extent of 13-14 percent.

On net interest margin (NIM) contraction

Also read: SBI gains on almost three-fold jump in Q1 net profit

The reason is that in the last quarter of the previous year, we had about Rs 850 crore worth of interest coming on income tax refunds. These one-offs are ones which are normally seen in the last quarters.

Looking at the core business model of the bank, there is no challenge and we are at 3.47 percent on a year-on-year basis.

NIM is always dynamic because yield on advances will keep on changing and similarly the cost of deposit will also keep on changing, cost of resources will keep on changing. But yes, of course, we are very mindful that we should try to have a decent NIM, which also means that we should not unnecessarily overprice our borrowers and we should not underpay our depositors.

On YONO and digital growth

We have around 6.5 crore digital banking users. These are not just users of YONO (You Only Need One, the bank’s integrated digital offering) but also across our other digital platforms.

If at all there's a need for digital and technology upgradation, resources are there.

Also, we are investing into analytics and acquiring more customers on the asset side through the digital mechanism. Last year around the first quarter, we had underwritten about Rs 20,000 odd crore through digital. This year, it's about Rs 29,000 crore that we have already underwritten.

On slippages

If we look at that trend, it looks a little on the higher side. Last year in the same quarter, we had slippages of around Rs 9,700 crore and from there, it has come down to about Rs 7,600 crore. So whatever recoveries we are affecting in July, it will actually get reflected in the September quarter. To that extent, the subsequent quarters will have the impact of the recoveries of the previous quarter."

State Bank of India (SBI) expects to give out 3.5 trillion rupees ($42.30 billion) in corporate loans over the rest of this financial year as private companies step up investments in key sectors, the chairman of the country's largest lender said.

The Indian economy has been starved of private investment for years now but a surge in government capital spending and deleveraged corporate balance sheets has led to early signs of companies adding to their capacity.

And nearly 80% of this incremental loan demand is coming from the private sector, SBI chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara told Reuters in an interview over the weekend.

""Invariably there is a rub-off effect on small and medium enterprises also.""

About 70% of the 3.5 trillion rupees would be in term loans and help boost SBI's corporate loan book by 12%-13% this fiscal, said Khara.

""New projects are coming into greenfield sectors like renewable energy, batteries and battery storage as well as EVs (electric vehicles) among others,"" he said.

""In the core sectors, it is essentially the addition to capacity in sectors like steel, cement, road infrastructure and airports.""

SBI's total domestic advances were 28 trillion rupees as of June 30.

Credit demand in India has been mostly for home, auto and personal loans and SBI has been very ""mindful"" of the potential stress this segment could cause, given high interest rates.

Over 80% of SBI's retail loans are to its salary-account holders, giving it greater visibility on a borrower's cash flow.

In June, Reuters reported bankers expect the central bank to increase risk weights on unsecured personal loans and credit cards to cool demand.

This, Khara said, would make credit expensive for consumers.

""High-cost consumption credit is not a good idea.""

SBI's stock has gained over 9% in the past 12 months, less than the 15% rise in the broader BSE Bankex index.

Analysts have often said SBI, with a market capitalisation of 5.08 trillion rupees, is undervalued since its share price does not capture the value of its subsidiaries.

""The valuation of the top four or five entities is about 2.5-3 trillion (rupees) ... of both listed and unlisted companies,"" Khara estimated.

But SBI does not have any immediate monetisation plans.

""Maybe in a year or two, we might decide about listing SBI General Life Insurance. Monetising the stake in SBI Mutual Fund is not a focus for us currently.""

At 14.56%, SBI is adequately capitalised, Khara said, adding SBI will ensure capital is not a constraint to supporting balance sheet growth."

“History has shown over and over, that bull markets can go well beyond rational valuation levels as long as outlook for future earnings is positive.” - Peter Bernstein

After a brief lull, the sale of shares by promoters has resumed with vigour. Over a billion dollars worth of stock have been offloaded since the window for insider sales reopened for companies that have reported their earnings. The Street is divided on this trend. The arguments for and against insider selling remains the same. Veterans say that promoter selling is not as reliable an indicator of the stock being overvalued as much as promoter buying is an indicator of the shares being undervalued.

Besides, the supply of shares has been absorbed without a hiccup, pointing to strong appetite among investors — both institutional and retail. There is merit in this argument. But what about the fact that so many promoters have been selling their shares at the same time.

One theory doing the round is that promoters are aware that their shares are no longer cheap after the recent run-up. Also, they feel the market could

move into a consolidation phase shortly as speculation over the outcome of the general elections could hold many investors back from making big purchases. At this point, the odds are heavily in favour of the NDA returning to power though views vary on the margin of victory. To that extent, the market already appears to be pricing in political stability and continuity of the existing policies.

So, election results may not necessarily be the key trigger to take the market to the next orbit: An NDA victory seems almost a given as far as Dalal Street is concerned. So, the focus will once again shift to earnings and execution. In many cases, the market appears to have priced in earnings two years ahead.

Considering these factors, it may not be a bad idea to take some money off the table, promoters feel, since share prices are unlikely to rise at the same pace in the near future, as they have been over the last year.

And, here is something that the new investors may not be aware of, but old investors would only know too well. While many mid and small cap companies have suddenly become stock market darlings, it is during a bull run that you see the earnings at their best. That is also because promoters realise it is worth showing all the profits on the books as the market will reward them with a higher market capitalisation.

Interest rates

Even as the market bets on the RBI cutting interest rates by the end of 2023, looks like borrowers may have to put up with rising rates for a while. Karur Vysya Bank has hiked the lending rates by 25 basis points across tenures with effect from August 7. Over the last month, three banks — SBI, Bank of India and South Indian Bank — have raised the lending rates by 5-10 basis points across tenures.

Higher for longer

In the US, too, yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is close to its highest level in over a decade as investors bet that the economy will continue to strengthen even as the interest rates stay high. This is bad news for home-owners looking to refinance their mortgages, and also those in the queue to buy a home. At the same time, it is good news for risk-averse savers and to pension funds that have been forced for years to take greater risks to meet return targets.

SBI contrarian

Most analysts have retained their bullish ratings on SBI after the first quarter earnings. An exception to the trend is HSBC, which has downgraded its rating to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ earlier.

Analysts Abhishek Murraka, Rahil Shah and Priyesh Jain feel the bank will hurt from a double whammy of rising deposit costs and a highly competitive environment in which demand for corporate loans is low, forcing banks to offer highly attractive rates.

“Incrementally, we believe it will be difficult for SBI to prevent net interest margin (NIM) compression. In an environment where NIM and operating costs are both under pressure, fees become an important lever. However, SBI’s fee/assets remain low at 48 bps (annualised) in the quarter. Given credit costs likely to normalise as well, we believe earnings growth will likely remain lacklustre for SBI over FY24-25,” the trio write, adding that SBI’s earnings growth will be slower relative to peers.

RBL Bank

After drawing flak for its investment in RBL Bank, Mahindra and Mahindra has promised investors and analysts that it will maintain a disciplined approach towards capital allocation, primarily focusing on its core areas – auto, farm, financial services, IT services, and selected growth areas within the group. It has now said it won’t buy more shares of RBL Bank in the foreseeable future and it will add to its stake “only if it makes sense strategically”. This contrasts with its stance a couple of weeks back when the auto major hinted that it was open to raising its stake in the bank up to the maximum permitted 10 percent.

Bulls appear to be retreating from RBL Bank for the time being as a safety net to the stock price has vanished with M&M’s latest statement.

Cummins India

Cummins India shares took a beating on Friday after first quarter earnings. The market was betting that the company would gain from advance purchases by customers looking to beat the Central Pollution Control Board IV deadline. But there has been a slight change in the plot.

“The dilution of Central Pollution Control Board IV timelines would make Cummins run parallel operations of old and new nodes of its powergen products. The majority of its powergen demand for this year should come from old nodes, deferring the discovery of demand, pricing and margins for the new nodes,” said a note by Kotak Institutional Equities.

Tailpiece

The otherwise humdrum proceedings at the Indian Hume Pipe AGM was enlivened briefly when one of the shareholders asked the CMD of the company as to why the company was not being more aggressive. As if to drive home his point, the shareholder remarked the CMD should take a leaf from book of Marvel superhero Spiderman who did not shy from taking risks.

Compared to the March 2023 quarter, NII dropped 3.68 percent.

The net interest margin (NIM) of the lender grew by 24 bps to 3.47 percent from 3.23 percent last year. However, it was down by 37 bps sequentially.

In a note, domestic brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher said the bank’s NII was lower due to softer loan growth, while NIM was in-line. Loan accretion, too, was slower at 14.9 percent YoY as against the brokerage firm’s estimate of 16.5 percent.

On the asset quality front, gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio of the bank declined to 2.76 percent as compared with 3.91 percent last year.

The net non-performing assets (NNPAs) ratio of the bank fell to 0.71 percent compared with 1 percent last year.

“SBI reported better than expected PAT despite steep margin decline (-37 bps sequentially) and lower than expected credit growth (+1.1 percent QoQ) due to lower operating expense (-13.7 percent QoQ) and improved credit costs (-24.6 percent QoQ),” analysts at InCred Equities said.

Margin decline is attributable to sharp surge in domestic term deposits (+4 percent qoq) which has resulted in surge in cost of funds and improved Loan to Deposit ratio to 71 percent.

“Credit growth in retail segment healthy at ~2.13% qoq of which home loans grew ~1.85% qoq, however corporate loan growth remains subdued at +0.25% qoq which impacted overall credit growth,” InCred Equities added.

It further said asset quality trend remained volatile sequentially with sequential surge in slippages as well as rise in SMA 1 and 2 accounts (Special Mention Accounts). However, the same is attributable to seasonality factor pertaining to agri related book of the bank

“Though we do remain concerned over margin profile in coming quarters, growth volatility due to corporate slowdown is likely to normalize in coming quarters,” it added.

SBI stock is down 6 percent this year, while the 1-year return stands at 7.75 percent.

""We are looking at a credit growth of 14 to 15 percent in FY24. Our credit growth will be broad based in retail, agriculture, small and medium sized enterprises and corporate sectors,"" Khara said at a press conference post the results.

Provisions of the lender stood atRs 2,501 crore, compared to Rs 4,392 crore last year.

Slippages of the lender for the April-June FY24 quarter were at Rs 7659 crore down by 21.37 percent from Rs 9740 crore last year.

Banks such as the State Bank of India (SBI), which have access to public deposits, issue infrastructure bonds because of various reasons, including a growing demand for credit that isn’t being met through deposits, Fixed Matters said.

Fixed Matters is an X handle run by WintWealth, a Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) registered online bond platform.

On July 31, SBI raised Rs 10,000 crore through an infrastructure bond at a coupon rate of 7.54 percent for a tenor of 15 years.

In a long thread explaining why banks issue bonds, Fixed Matters wrote, “Over the past few years there has been an increase in the demand for loans but there are not enough deposits available to fund them. Infrastructure bonds and other capital market issuances have become one of the ways to bridge this gap.”

Infra bonds, which can be issued by banks or public-sector undertakings or institutions, also have a favourable tenor that helps banks avoid asset-liability mismatches.

“The infrastructure assets typically have tenor exceeding 10 years. Fixed deposits on the other hand are payable on demand i.e. retail investors can redeem their FDs at any point of time,” the August 2 post said, referring to fixed deposits.

Banks also have more flexibility with such bond issuances, in terms of the liquidity reserves they have to maintain and the allocations needed for priority sectors.

Banks are required to set aside a percentage of funds in the form of liquid cash, gold or other securities with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to protect the financial ecosystem from sudden disruptions. These funds or reserves are known as Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) requirements.

“Maintaining this requirement creates a negative carry for banks and reduces their profitability. However, Infrastructure Bonds are not subject to this CRR or SLR requirement which helps banks to improve their profitability,” the post said.

Banks also must set aside a portion of their assets to lend to socially critical sectors that require financial assistance. This Priority-Sector Lending (PSL) covers sectors such as agriculture, water and sanitation and education.

“Banks are typically always short of these PSL assets and find it tough to meet the target.”

To promote infrastructure finance, the RBI has exempted the banks from providing PSL deployment for the assets generated out of these infrastructure bonds, the post said.

Shashank Sharma, a financial advisor from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, has been facing issues with the State Bank of India’s (SBI) digital and mobile platform, You Only Need One (YONO). Sharma has been trying to open a savings account on YONO but he has only met with failure.

“I am trying to open a savings account on YONO. But it shows technical errors every time,” said Sharma.

Surya, a freelance photographer and student from Madurai faced similar issues. “Even after putting all the details, the app says that there is some error,” Surya said.

One thing which was observed with Sharma, Surya and a few other complaints Moneycontrol analysed, was a common draft response from the bank.

These complaints on Twitter received the same reply from SBI’s official handle: “Dear Customer, presently we are facing technical challenges as per your account opening process. We would request you to please visit a nearby SBI branch to open a regular savings account.”

Complaints from customers

The issues with YONO are not just with non-SBI customers. Harshit Chaturvedi, an IT professional based out of Mumbai who faced issues when updating his know your customer (KYC) details on YONO.

“The YONO app is not able to update my KYC details. There is the same technical issue it displays every time,” he said.

Moneycontrol had, in April 2023, highlighted similar customer complaints with YONO. The bank had then said that YONO services would not be available for a few hours on April 1 due to its annual closing activities.

But why are these issues with non-customers and customers of YONO important now?

The lender, had in July 2023 launched a revamped version of YONO. It launched a multitude of unified payments interface (UPI) facilities, including scan and pay, pay by contacts, request money, and other facilities. The new version of the app also worked on improving the existing technical issues.

“The YONO app has been revamped, keeping in mind the expectations of our customers for a seamless and pleasant digital experience,” SBI Chairman Dinesh Khara had earlier said.

History of YONO

SBI launched YONO as its digital banking platform in 2017 for its 400 million customers. The idea to create a super mobile app with all banking services and facilities such as e-commerce and shopping came from the bank’s desire to set up a digital marketplace to attract young customers.

“It was increasingly becoming clear to me that we had to do something remarkably different from the run-of-the-mill apps to catapult SBI as a leader in the digital space as well,” former SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said in his book The Custodian of Trust, describing the journey and early days of YONO.

The latest numbers of SBI showed that new savings accounts opened daily on YONO fell from around 26,000 in March 2022 to 23,000 in March 2023.

Also read: SBI’s YONO story: Drop in new account opening, loan disbursals and rising customer complaints

Here, Chandan Sinha, former Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India said: “At times, we’ve seen that services on YONO are not working. There are problems in the processing and service part.”

Tech issues

SBI on April 3 faced technical issues with its servers and YONO. After customers complained that the services were down, the lender in a statement said: ""We regret to inform you that due to a 'technical glitch', some of our digital services were impacted for a few hours on April 03, 2023. However, the issue stands resolved, and the digital services are live and restored. We apologise for the inconvenience to our valued customers. The bank is always working toward implementing measures to prevent such occurrences. We thank you for your patience and continued trust in SBI.”

Not only SBI, but there are issues with other banks' digital mobile applications.

For example, the country's largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, in February 2023 faced issues with its digital and web banking services. ICICI bank was another private sector bank which faced a tech outage in May 2023. Other than this, some customers of HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank, Bank of Baroda and IDFC First Bank, who participated in the retail digital rupee pilot, have complained of technical problems and issues while making payments.

Industry experts highlight that due to large volumes, bugs and some external threats, there are constant issues. “Large volume is an issue which needs caution. There is also a need for a robust testing mechanism. But banks and regulators are paying increasingly more attention,” said Jindal Haria, Associate Director - India Ratings & Research.

The country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday raised Rs 10,000 crore at a coupon rate of 7.54 per cent through its third infrastructure bond issuance. The bidding ended on July 31 and the proceeds will be used in enhancing its long-term resources for funding infrastructure and the affordable housing segment, SBI said in a statement.

""The tenor of these bonds is 15 years. This is the first issuance of long-term bonds by any bank for this tenor in the current financial year. The issue attracted an overwhelming response from investors with bids of Rs 21,698 crore and was oversubscribed 4.34 times against the base issue size,” the statement said.

The number of bids received was 115, indicating wide participation, it said, adding that the investors included provident funds, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and corporates. Based on the response, the bank has decided to accept Rs 10,000 crore at a coupon rate of 7.54 per cent payable annually for a tenor of 15 years.

This represents a spread of 13 bps over the corresponding Financial Benchmark of India Limited (FBIL) G-Sec par curve, it said. Prior to this, the bank had raised infrastructure bonds of Rs 9,718 crore on January 19, 2023, at a spread of 17 bps over the corresponding FBIL G-Sec par curve. The bank has a AAA credit rating with a stable outlook from domestic credit rating agencies for these instruments.

This issuance is significant as, despite the recent hardening of yields, the bank has been successful in raising 15-year long-term bonds at a finer spread, the statement said, adding that this will help the bank in providing long-term loans to the infrastructure sector.

Economists at the country’s largest lender SBI on Thursday advanced their estimate on the Indian economy becoming the third largest in the world by two years to 2027.

In a note that comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi exuded confidence of winning a third term and India galloping to being the third largest till 2029, SBI economists said India’s real GDP will grow at over 6.5 per cent in FY24.

""The path taken by India since 2014 reveals that India is likely to get the tag of the third largest economy in 2027 (or FY28) based on actual GDP data as on March 2023, a movement of 7 places upwards since 2014, when India was ranked 10th and two years earlier than our previous forecast of 2029,” the economists said in the note.

PM Modi-led NDA government came to power in 2014. The RBI estimates the real GDP to grow at 6.5 per cent, which is one of the highest estimates by any watchers. At present, India is the fifth largest economy in the world. The SBI report said the GDP will grow at 8.1 per cent in the first quarter of FY24, which ensures that the overall expansion surpasses 6.5 per cent.

Stating that the economy is in a ""sustained goldilocks” period, the economists at the state-owned lender said becoming the third largest economy will be a ""remarkable achievement by any standards” for India. The incremental increase of USD 1.8 trillion estimated in the economy’s size between 2022-27 will be more than the current size of the Australian economy, the economists said.

India’s share in the global GDP will be 4 per cent by 2027, they said, adding that the economy will add 0.75 trillion to its overall size every two years. Such a pace of GDP expansion will make India a USD 20 trillion economy by 2047 when the nation will be celebrating a century of its existence as a free state.

A nominal growth of 11-11.5 per cent or a real growth of 6.5-7 per cent per annum will help India’s compounded annual growth rate come to 8.4 per cent, it said, adding that such a growth is ""eminently possible”. Among states, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh will breach the USD 500 billion mark on their respective GSDP by 2027, the report said, adding the Yogi Aditynath-ruled northern state is the ""land of the midnight sun”.

The note also said that PM Modi’s recent visits to the US and France will deliver significant long-term economic gains for India in areas of onshoring of chip manufacturing, defence relationship, climate transition and climate finance, trade disputes and creation of special economic zones."

The scope of the digital rupee is under close watch since the central bank digital currency (CBDC) was rolled out, according to State Bank of India Chairman Dinesh Khara.

""The scope can be further enlarged by including financial institutions such as mutual funds or insurance services, when they actively participate in settlements of government securities (G-Sec) or state developmental loans,"" Khara said at the Financial Inclusion and FinTech Summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) on July 19.

""It is a very valid case. CBDC will take away a part of the physical currency circulation, as well as bring efficiency in settlements,"" he said.

He noted that after the recent pilot of the digital rupee, during which a liquid network was created across the country, there was decent traction in retail settlements as well. ""Considering the reduced cost of currency management and formalisation of the country's economy, this will go a long way,"" said the SBI chief.

But he pointed out that CBDC would not be a substitute for physical currency. ""For a country of our size, CBDC cannot replace physical currency. There is a scope and case for the co-existence of both physical currency and digital rupee.""

The State Bank of India (SBI), the country's largest public sector lender, on Juky 14 hiked the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points (bps) with effect from July 15.

Details on SBI’s website showed that the MCLR based rates will now range between 8 percent and 8.75 percent.

MCLR is the basic minimum rate at which a bank can give consumers loans.

Earlier, on March 15, the lender hiked the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 70 basis points.

The hike has been announced by SBI a month after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept the repo rate, or the rate at which it lends short-term funds to commercial banks, at 6.50 percent.

Since May, RBI has hiked interest rates by 225 basis points to fight inflation. One bps is one hundredth of a percentage point.

The jump in lending rates is seen as a ripple effect of the rate hikes being implemented by the Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI since mid-last year, in a bid to tame inflation.

RBI while announcing the decision to pause the repo rate in June 2023, Governor Shaktikanta Das also signalled the central bank’s readiness to act in keeping with the incoming data.

While the RBI has largely come to the end of the rate-tightening cycle, the rate-setting panel is expected to remain on the pause mode for rest of the year with a chance of a rate cut if inflation eases on a sustainable basis, economists have said."

At 11:15 am, SBI shares were quoting at Rs 592, up 0.4 percent from the previous day's close on the National Stock Exchange. The stock has gained more than 5 percent in the last five days.

According to a disclosure on stock exchanges, SBI said that the transaction will be conducted on an arms-length basis. The rationale behind the acquisition, the bank said, is better governance and will require a nod from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

SVL was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of SBICAPS on November 10, 2005. Its main objectives are to conduct asset management and investment advisory services. Additionally, SVL aims to support the establishment and provision of various funds, including venture capital and technology funds, as well as offering seed capital, risk capital foundation, and loan services.

The move gains significance as this is the second time in quick succession that the SBI has received ECCB approval. In late June, the board gave the green light to acquire a 20 percent stake in SBI Pension Funds, the largest in the country with around 37 percent market share as of May 2023.

S&P also upgraded its rating for SBI's standalone credit profiles which reflects lower credit risk and improving earnings.

The government gave its nod to the issuance of the 27th tranche of electoral bonds that will begin sale today.

This development comes prior to the assembly elections of Rajasthan, Chhatisgarh, Telengana, and Mizoram. The poll dates for the respective states are anticipated to be announced in the next couple of months.

Electoral bonds have been pitched as an alternative to cash donations made to political parties as part of the government’s efforts to maintain transparency in political funding.

The State Bank of India, in the 27th phase of the sale, has been authorised to issue and encash electoral bonds through 29 authorised branches, from July 3-12, said the finance ministry in a statement.

The sale of the first batch of electoral bonds took place between Mar 1-Mar 10, 2018.

The SBI branches with the authorisation include those in Bangalore, New Delhi, Patna, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Kolkata, Shimla, Dehradun, Chennai, Srinagar, Gandhinagar, Bhopal, Mumbai, and Raipur.

SBI is the only authorised bank to issue electoral bonds.

Electoral bonds have 15-day validity from the date of issuance. There will be no payment to any political party if the bond is deposited after the validity period is over, the statement noted.

Indian citizens, or entities incorporated or established in the country can but these bonds.

Registered political parties that have secured not less than 1 percent of the votes polled in the last Lok Sabha or legislative assembly election are eligible to receive funding through electoral bonds."

In a bid to ensure a more seamless digital banking experience for its consumers, the State Bank of India unveiled its revamped digital banking application ‘Yono for Every Indian’ and Interoperable Cardless Cash Withdrawal (ICCW) facilities on July 2.

The roll out further fortifies the lender’s commitment towards ensuring the access of inclusive and customer-centric digital banking services to every Indian citizen.

‘Yono for Every Indian’ will provide all SBI customers access to a multitude of UPI facilities, including Scan and Pay, Pay by contacts, Request money, among others, on YONO’s revamped platform.

On this occasion, Dinesh Khara, Chairman of the State Bank of India, said, ""SBI is dedicated to offering cutting-edge digital banking solutions that empower every Indian with financial independence and convenience. The YONO app has been revamped, keeping in mind the expectations of our customers for a seamless and pleasant digital experience. This will further fulfill our goal of making the 'YONO for Every Indian' mission a reality.""

This May, the State Bank of India experienced declines in new account openings and loan disbursals on its digital platform, YONO, according to a Moneycontrol analysis earlier this year. Experts had attributed this decrease to technological issues and a lack of effective customer engagement strategies. The bank's customers had reported problems with the YONO mobile app.

However, despite the issues, YONO has emerged as one the most trusted digital banking apps in the country, with more than 6 crore registered users, ever since its launch in 2017. In FY23, 64 percent or 78.60 lakh savings accounts were acquired digitally through YONO.

With the Interoperable Cardless Cash Withdrawal facility rollout, customers of SBI, as well as other banks can seamlessly withdraw cash from the ICCW-enabled ATMs of any bank, using the ‘UPI QR Cash’ functionality.

The elimination of the need to enter a PIN or physically handle a debit card by the ICCW facility also minimizes the risks associated with shoulder surfing or card cloning."

Bank of Baroda became India's second public sector bank to surpass Rs 1-trillion market cap with the stock hitting a fresh record high.

The stock scaled a record Rs 194 a share, up 3 percent from its previous close. State Bank of India is the only Indian PSU lender which has crossed this milestone.

The stock is up nearly 20 percent since March 28. The strong gains came after robust earnings in the March quarter as well as for the whole year of FY23.

The lender reported its highest quarterly net profit of Rs 4,775 crore in March quarter, recording a 168 percent year-on-year rise. Annually, the bank recorded a profit of Rs 14,110 crore, up 94 percent from Rs 7,272 crore.

An SBI study said on June 19 that the withdrawal of Rs 2,000 currency notes will boost bank deposits, repayment of loans, and have a positive impact on consumption and Reserve Bank of India's retail CBDC (central bank digital currency).

On May 19, the banking regulator decided to withdraw the highest-denomination note of Rs 2,000 from circulation as a part of currency management. In value term, the share of 2,000 denomination notes (Rs 3.62 lakh crore) was at 10.8 percent as on March 23.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said on 8 June that around 1.8 lakh crore of 2,000-rupee notes had come back into the system. Of this, around 85 percent or Rs 1.5 lakh crore have come as deposits and the rest are exchanged for other smaller denominations.

“Even as Rs 1.5 lakh crore of Rs 2,000 notes has been deposited at the banks...This implies that the amount spent / exchanged by people over the counter is Rs 60,000 crore (Rs 1.5 lakh crore net of Rs 90,000 crore decline in currency in circulation Rs 60,000 crore)... This could also result in a bank deposit boost, repayment of loans boost, consumption boost, RBI retail CBDC boost and a possible GDP boost,” the SBI study mentioned.

The ‘precision strike’ by the central bank hits the right notes on multiple counts, taking pressure off substantially from near war-like quest for deposits from banking system while also smoothening the bias for higher interest rates going forward. Additionally, the move effectively anchors the surge in incremental credit-deposit (C/D) ratio, nearing pre-pandemic levels, by filling the coffers and keeping banks ready to meet funding needs from diverse sectors, it added.

The study also pointed out that as overseas markets remain choppy, Indian banks should get more elbow room to meet the demands from corporates to fund their expansion plans through a mix of credit facilities.

Deposit in the banking system through corporates is witnessing smart traction, majorly through bulk deposits, as better returns with liquidity and safety has made bank deposits a favourite alternative for corporates from diverse strata including PSUs and NBFCs.

RBI’s retail CBDC project (E-RUPI) should be an ultimate beneficiary of this tactical move as it transitions from a beta-testing phase in the CUG (Close User Group). The absence of higher denomination note should propel faster adoption of E-RUPI for merchant transactions, concurrent with physical fiat currency."

The debate over difference in executive's pay packages between public sector banks (PSBs) and private sector banks has emerged again. On June 14, Moneycontrol reported that Dinesh Khara, the Chairman of State Bank of India took home an annual salary of Rs 37 lakh in FY23.

Khara manages Rs 55.17 lakh crore of assets (as of March 2023) for India's largest bank. And while his compensation (comprising of basic pay and dearness allowance) has increased by around 7.5 percent compared to the previous year, it is still not comparable to that of his private bank peers.

As a point of comparison, HDFC Bank CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan drew Rs 6.51 crore in FY22. He manages a balance sheet less than half of SBI.

And while the FY23 numbers aren’t out yet, even compared to last year Khara drew some 18 times less than Jagdishan. On the whole, the salary figures of other private bank executives are also quite high when compared to that of the SBI Chief and other PSB heads.

The report of Khara’s salary almost instantly triggered a debate on social media. While some argued that his compensation is too low considering the size of the bank he heads, others felt the SBI Chairman’s job comes with other perks.

Is PSB Chief salary too low?

This is, in fact, an old debate. In 2020, an innocuous joke by the then SBI boss, Rajnish Kumar, triggered a debate in India’s banking circles — the humble compensation packages of government-run bank officers, compared with the salaries of their private sector counterparts.

In a recent conference call with analysts, Kumar was asked if his bank would undertake a pay cut for employees. Pat came his reply: ""Road pe aake rehna padega, pehle hi itni kam milti hai."" (I'll have to live on the road, I already get so less).

Though this was said in jest, no one could miss the undertones to the relatively lower pay of state-run bankers. And as it happens with such comments, Kumar’s remarks triggered a fresh debate on the issue. The comments didn’t go well with many in the banking industry.

Industry agrees?

One former SBI chairman said Kumar’s comment was in bad taste and amounted to lowering the dignity of his office. The person did not want to be named. A few others sympathised with Kumar, saying he indeed has a point about the lower pay levels in PSBs.

Is SBI chief’s pay equitable for the head of India’s biggest bank? That depends on which side of the debate you are on. The SBI Chairman salary must be seen in combination with the perks enjoyed. Here are a few: a plush bungalow in Mumbai, dedicated help, two cars with drivers, unlimited petrol, and so on. But, even then, the total compensation (including perks) will still be far lower than private sector bank peers.

In fact, the pay disparity between PSB chiefs and private bank chiefs isn’t an issue that is limited to the banking sector alone. This is true for companies across all sectors. The problem is that this lack of level playing field could create a lack of incentive for professionals to have longer stints with state-run banks. While the pay disparity is huge, PSUs and particularly banks are supposed to compete with private sector rivals with the same aggression.

As JN Gupta, founder of SES, a proxy advisory firm and former executive director at the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) puts it, PSBs need to be granted a level-playing field to compete with private banks. “Right now, they are asked to run a race with their arms and legs tied,” Gupta said.

Some of the former bankers who have held top positions in PSBs point out that the low pay is a factor that acts as a turn off for the top executives. The interesting point is the issue is not only about PSU bankers, even central bankers had spoken about lower pay in public sector.

In August 2016, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan called attention to the issue when he said salaries of top level employees of the public sector, including RBI, are way short of global standards. ""One of the problems, of course, is that the public sector overpays at the bottom but underpays at the top. I also feel underpaid,"" Rajan had said.

Agri and start-up lending

Earlier Moneycontrol reported that some public sector, as well as private sector banks, have seen a pick-up in their agricultural loan book, a segment that lenders have traditionally looked at with abundant caution amid weather uncertainties, and risks like El Nino.

El Nino is a natural phenomenon where the surface temperature of ocean water becomes warmer than usual, which affects the pressure conditions over the Indian Ocean and leads to a weakening of trade winds blowing from east to west. This is accompanied by lower rainfall.

The banks, on average, grew their agri loan portfolio by 17 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis.

Canara Bank in its results for the quarter ended March 2023 showed a 21 percent growth in its agriculture portfolio on a year-on-year basis. The bank, whose agri-loan book stood at Rs 1.75 lakh crore in quarter ended March 2022, took it to Rs 2.13 lakh crore by the end of the March 2023 quarter.

Among private sector banks, Kotak Mahindra Bank’s customer assets in the agriculture sector grew to Rs 27,547 crore, a growth of 9 percent from Rs 26,128 crore in March 2022.

Khara’s salary included Rs 27 lakh basic pay and Rs 9.99 lakh dearness allowance. In the previous fiscal year, Khara earned Rs 34.42 lakh in annual salary for the financial year ending 2021-22 (FY22), 13.4 percent higher than what his predecessor Rajnish Kumar drew during FY21.

Khara joined SBI as a probationary officer in 1984 and took over as the bank chairman in October 2020. He previously served as MD of the bank in charge of global banking and SBI subsidiaries, among others.

SBI managing director C S Setty drew a salary of around the same figure as Khara in fiscal year 2023 which included Rs 26.3 lakhs basic pay and Rs 9.7 lakhs dearness allowance while former MD Ashwani Bhatia who served till May 31, 2022 took home a salary of Rs 5.7 lakhs. Bhatia later joined as wholetime member of markets regulator Securities and exchange board of India.

Other top officials, S Janakiraman and A K Tewari got Rs 36 lakhs each while A K Choudhari took home Rs 28.5 lakhs, according to the annual report.

According to the annual report, with an objective to continuously improve corporate governance, a reputed external consulting organisation assisted

the bank in laying down parameters for performance evaluation of directors, Chairman, Board level committees and central Board as

a whole. The organisation also facilitated the performance evluation process, the annual report said.

""The performance evaluation of the Board has validated the Board of Directors’ confidence in the governance values of the Bank, the synergy and collaboration amongst the Board of Directors and the top Management,"" the report said.

SBI said with effect from 25th October 2019, sitting fees of Rs70,000 is paid for attending the meetings of the central Board and Rs30,000 for attending the meetings of other Board level Committees. Non-Executive NonOfficial Directors of the Bank are paid sitting fee for attending the meetings the Board/ Committees of the Board.

There has been a long-standing debate on the salary disparity between top bankers in public sector and private sector banks. Typically, top executives at private sector banks get far higher annual compensation compared with that of state-run banks.

To give a perspective, Axis Bank managing director and chief executive officer (MD & CEO) Amitabh Chaudhry was the highest-paid private bank chief in India in the previous financial year, drawing a total of Rs 7.62 crore in annual salary, as per the bank’s FY22 annual report.

Chaudhry was also separately granted a total of 412,938 stock options of Axis Bank during FY22, on the basis of approval received from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Axis Bank annual report said. The stock options were granted at Rs 726.25 per share.

After a stellar show in the final quarter of FY23, banking and finance companies emerged as the top picks of analysts in May, with heavyweights like SBI, HDFC twins, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank garnering zero ""sell"" calls.

In contrast, the information technology (IT) pack had to bear the brunt of the Street’s ire as the slowdown in the West and the banking crisis in the US – the bread-and-butter market for India’s software services industry – led to a forgettable quarter

Overall, companies with better earnings visibility scored over their counterparts mired in macro and operational challenges. A bird in hand proved better than two in the bush.

The 'buy' list

The two companies with the perfect optimism score — zero ""sell"" or ""hold"" calls — were SBI Life and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone.

SBI Life Insurance Company declared a decent set of numbers in Q4. Net profit rose 15 percent year on year (YoY) to Rs 777 crore, while net premium income climbed 14 percent to Rs 19,897 crore.

The gross written premium (GWP), a key metric to assess an insurance company's fiscal health, jumped 15 percent for FY23 to Rs 67,320 crore.

Analysts were heartened by the all-round improvement in operational metrics.

“The management is confident of delivering 20–25 percent business growth in FY24E on the back of healthy demand and improving penetration owing to regulatory changes. The diversified distribution channels are expected to contribute significantly to the overall growth of the company,” brokerage KRChoksey said in a note.

The company has been maintaining its cost leadership among the private players over the past few years, despite an increase in operating costs led by increased spending on new initiatives, it added.

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), too, posted strong quarterly numbers, with revenues soaring 40 percent to Rs 5,797 crore, supported by Haifa port consolidation.

“As APSEZ embarks on becoming India's largest integrated transport utility company by 2030, it is strengthening its capabilities in all logistics segments (ports, warehousing, last mile delivery, ICDs, etc). Hence, it will offer end-t- end service to its customers thereby capturing a higher wallet share and also making the cargo sticky in nature,” analysts at ICICI Direct said.

In tandem with other Adani group stocks, APSEZ has rebounded following the rout triggered by American short-seller Hindenburg Research’s report in late January. The report accused the port-to-power conglomerate of stock manipulation and other wrongdoings. The group has denied the charges.

APSEZ is up over 87 percent over its 52-week low of Rs 394.95 hit on February 3.

The other prominent names figuring on top of analysts’ buy lists include SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC and Axis Bank.

Banking and finance firms had a standout quarter, marked by robust disbursements despite rising rates, healthy interest margins and stable asset quality.

Public sector banks’ cumulative profit crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore-mark in the financial year 2023, with market leader SBI accounting for nearly half of the total earnings.

From posting a net loss of Rs 85,390 crore in 2017-18, PSBs have come a long way.

“The banking sector reported a strong 4Q FY23, driven by healthy loan growth, stable margins, and continued asset quality improvements. There were numerous drivers of credit expansion, with the retail and MSME sectors exhibiting robust growth and the corporate book displaying a healthy rebound,” brokerage Motilal Oswal said.

Declining fortunes

JSW Steel topped the pessimism list with 17 ""sell"", nine ""hold"" and just six ""buy"" calls.

Its Q4 performance was mixed -- consolidated net profit rose 13 percent to Rs 3,664 crore, even as revenue from operations stayed flat at Rs 46,962 crore.

The company also said it recorded higher-ever crude steel production as well as saleable steel sales during the quarter.

The narrative around the metal space has turned negative, given that China's demand has not really come up despite its post-Covid reopening, while recession fears in the West are further weighing on outlook.

“Though global steel consumption is facing headwinds due to inflationary pressures, high interest rate pressures, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a slowdown in China, steel demand is robust in the domestic market,” analysts at Motilal Oswal said.

Some of the most prominent names on this list, however, are IT companies.

India’s IT giants have been clobbered by project cancellations, margin contraction and slowing order inflows amid the gathering clouds of recession in the West.

“We remain underweight on IT as a sector. The macro overhang witnessed post the unfolding of regional bank issues in the US and EU impacted the growth and margin exit rates in March 2023. The companies which reported March 2023 results… expect some spillover of this weakness into the June 2023 quarter as well,” said Shibani Sircar Kurian, Senior EVP & Head-Equity Research, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company.

Initial expectations of margin improvement have been kept under check on account of negative operating leverage, given the sudden ramp-downs the sector had seen.

“Overall, we expect the operating environment over the next two quarters to remain challenging due to the macro issues and cautious stance of companies on discretionary spends,” she added.

Pharma and auto companies, too, attracted a raft of ""sell"" and ""hold"" calls due to factors like revenue collapse post-Covid, negative consumer sentiment due to elevated inflation and demand headwinds.

Road ahead

Analysts say the bulk of Nifty’s earnings growth in FY24 is expected to come from sectors linked to investment and domestic consumption.

“Nifty ended FY23 with an 11% EPS growth on a high base of 34% growth in FY22. Earnings though remain lopsided with BFSI driving almost entire incremental earnings in FY23. With healthy macros, range-bound oil prices, a robust fiscal balance sheets, and moderating inflation, the backdrop for the market is quite optimistic,” Motilal Oswal said.

Analysts are an optimistic bunch. They project hefty earnings per share (EPS) growth for the benchmark Nifty 50 every financial year, only to eat their words soon after.

Since FY12, Nifty earnings estimates have been revised downwards, notes Ambit Capital in a recent report. “Analysis indicates that in any financial year, EPS estimates have, on average, been revised downwards by 16 percent over the last two years, and by 8 percent on average over the last one year,” it said.

And even if the headline estimates were met, the earnings breadth remained poor. Some sectors, such as financials in FY23, powered the earnings story while sectors like consumer and utilities failed to deliver.

FY24 will be no different, believes Ambit Capital. In fact, more pain might be in store in FY24. Here’s a sector-wise analysis of the same.

Banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI)

Buoyed by repo rate hikes, banks saw a significant jump in net interest margins (NIMs) in the year gone by. The banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector contributed 195 percent to Nifty’s EPS growth ― from Rs 730 in FY22 to Rs 842 in FY23.

According to Ambit Capital, the earnings trajectory will likely change in FY24 with BFSI's contribution to incremental earnings growth tapering to 43 percent. “Loan growth will moderate to 12-14 percent from 15-16 percent as credit growth in corporate stays muted and deposit growth stays anchored at 10 percent,” it said.

Valuation-wise, the firm’s pecking order is Axis Bank, SBI, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Kotak Bank.

Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)

Last year, price hikes helped boost the topline of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies. Now, as inflation recedes, these companies have to start taking price cuts to help get back volumes.

But balancing the price-volume equation will be tricky, believe analysts. That’s because rural consumers will first prioritise deleveraging themselves, then invest in income-generating assets and eventually shift from unbranded to branded products.

“It would take some time for FMCG companies to revert to normalised volume growth of mid to high single digits,” according to Ambit Capital’s analysts. They have ‘Buy’ ratings only on Britannia and Godrej Consumer in this space.

IT

The second-largest weightage in the index is for Information Technology (IT) services, which have finally started to show cracks. In Q4, all tier-1 IT companies sounded off sluggish growth in BFSI, hi-tech, and telecom segments that make for the big clients.

Top-4 IT EBIT margin could decline 170 basis points (bps) to 20.6 percent over FY22-25E due to backfilling, deal transition, and travel costs, as per the report. Currently, Nifty IT trades at a 13 percent premium to Nifty versus a historical average of 9 percent, which makes the Street even more bearish on the sector.

Oil & gas

After dragging Nifty earnings by 42 percent in FY23, the oil and gas sector might turn the corner in FY24 on the back of China’s reopening and normalisation of the global energy market.

Ambit Capital expects oil and gas consumption to rise by 5 percent and 9 percent respectively in FY24. The increase in volumes will be accompanied by an improvement in gross marketing margins for oil marketing companies (OMCs) as crude prices trade lower. OMCs’ overall gross marketing margin is expected to be Rs 3.9 per litre in FY24.

Autos

After a year of strong volume rebound and margin expansion, this sector is set to see moderate numbers. This will be on the back of an elevated base, continued weakness in rural demand, a reversal in the tractor cycle after years of an upswing since FY20, and the introduction of stringent safety regulations like seatbelt reminders, airbags, etc., according to analysts.

Thus, Ambit Capital has ‘Sell’ ratings on Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra.

In conclusion

As these heavyweights on the index stare at an uncertain future, Ambit Capital's FY24 EPS estimate stands at Rs 940 while the consensus estimate is higher at Rs 991.

Shares of State Bank of India (SBI) declined nearly 2 percent after going ex-dividend on May 31. The stock reached a low of Rs 579.05 on the BSE. At 10.17am, the scrip was trading at Rs 582 on BSE, down 1.7 percent from its previous close.

During the announcement of its March quarter results, SBI declared a dividend of Rs 11.30 per share for the fiscal year 2023, against Rs 7.10 a share in FY22. The dividend payout is scheduled for June 14. In FY21, the lender announced a dividend of Rs 4 a share. SBI has not announced dividend in FY20 and FY19.

The financials

As per Moneycontrol calculations, dividend for FY23 will amount to over Rs 10,000 crore. According to Ace Equity, the dividend in FY22 amounted to Rs 6,336.47 crore and to Rs 3,569.84 crore in FY21.

The stock has seen a huge jump in the last two months with gains of over 16 percent compared to over 5 percent rise in benchmarks Sensex and Nifty.

Recently, SBI has announced a remarkable increase in net profit, driven by robust loan demand and a decline in provisions, reflecting improved asset quality during the March quarter. The bank witnessed an impressive surge of 83 percent in net profit, reaching Rs 16,695 crore. SBI achieved a milestone by surpassing the Rs 50,000-crore mark for net profit in the fiscal year 2023, becoming the first bank in India to achieve such an annual profit level.

Analyst's note

""SBI announced strong business growth momentum across all categories in Q4FY23 with its highest-ever bottom-line growth. Slippages remained under control, with recoveries and asset improvements outpacing slippages.... Given the core bank's strong business performance, including its highest-ever reported bottom line, growing network, and improving asset quality, which has aided improvement in core profitability metrics over the previous year as well as sequentially, we believe there is a significant upside in the stock and reiterate our recommendation to Buy the stock"", said Way2Wealth Research in its latest note.

Fretful over future enquiries by investigating agencies and the regulator, most banks are insisting on customers filling out separate forms for exchanging Rs 2,000 notes. Many banks have made such forms mandatory, Moneycontrol has found.

On May 19, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced the withdrawal of Rs 2,000 notes from circulation and gave citizens time until September 30 to exchange or deposit the notes.

The RBI said customers can make deposits into accounts without restrictions.

""The Rs 2,000 banknotes can be deposited into bank accounts and cash requirements can be drawn thereafter, against these deposits,"" RBI said in an official statement.

Members of the public can exchange Rs2,000 banknotes up to a limit of Rs 20,000 at a time, the central bank had said.

Playing safe

Banks are insisting on customers filling separate forms as a precautionary measure so that data on every such transaction is accounted for with customer details to share with RBI or other agencies if enquiries arise in future, bankers said.

""We have introduced forms because we want to keep data on who has exchanged money from our bank,” a senior banker in Mumbai/Delhi with a state-run bank told Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity.

“This is to ensure we don't fall in trouble (in case of future enquiries),"" the banker added.

Another banker said many people tried to come to branches to exchange Rs 2,000 notes multiple times.

""Only motive to come up with this separate form at the time of exchange is to keep track of how many people are coming to the branch to exchange the Rs 2,000 notes,” said the second banker.

To ascertain the progress of Rs2000 note deposits/ exchange, Moneycontrol reporters visited several bank branches in New Delhi and Mumbai.

Banks insisting on forms being filled include Punjab National Bank (PNB), Bank of Baroda (BOB), Canara Bank, Axis Bank, IDFC First Bank, RBL Bank and HDFC Bank.

""As directed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), we are facilitating Rs 2,000 denomination notes deposited in customer accounts without the requirement of any document submission. This has been ensured at all our branches across the country. Besides, the exchange of Rs 2,000 denomination bank notes is being facilitated, up to the limit of Rs 20,000 at a time, for our customers based on customer ID and for all non-HDFC Bank customers a copy of any of the officially valid document (OVD) or pan card is required. This is as per the RBI’s master direction on Know Your Customer and in line with the extant process of the bank. HDFC Bank stands committed to serving its customers,"" an official from HDFC Bank said.

Except for HDFC Bank, emails sent to other banks seeking responses for this story remained unanswered till the time of filing this copy.

A few banks such as ICICI Bank are using the deposit slip instead of separate forms for the exchange of Rs 2,000 notes.

""We are only allowing customers to exchange Rs 2,000 notes once in a day; also we are not facing any kind of liquidity crises so far and have enough cash for exchange,"" a Delhi-based banker said.

State Bank of India (SBI) on May 22 informed all its branches that no form or identity proof would be needed to exchange Rs 2,000 currency notes and reiterated the one-time limit of Rs 20,000 for depositing or exchanging banknotes.

""The facility of exchanging Rs 2,000 notes to all members of the public up to a limit of Rs 20,000 at a time will be allowed without obtaining any requisition slip,"" the country's largest lender said in a press release on May 20. ""No identity proof is required to be submitted by the tenderer at the time of exchange.""

Officials at SBI said there are no restrictions on customers coming in multiple times to exchange notes.

""This is true that many people are coming to exchange multiple times to exchange Rs 2,000 notes and exchanging more than 10 notes. However, we try to keep an eye on this too, ""said a senior SBI official.

Rs 2,000 note so far in the market

The latest release on May 19 by the RBI showed the total value of Rs 2,000 banknotes was Rs 3.62 lakh crore constituting only 10.8 percent of notes in circulation on March 31, 2023.

About 89 percent of the Rs 2,000 denomination banknotes were issued prior to March 2017 and are at the end of their estimated lifespan of 4-5 years.

“It has also been observed that this (Rs 2,000 banknote) denomination is not commonly used for transactions. Further, the stock of banknotes in other denominations continues to be adequate to meet the currency requirement of the public,” the RBI said in the release."

The Delhi High Court on May 23, reserved for judgment, a plea against permission to exchange Rs 2,000 banknotes without obtaining any requisition slip and identity proof.

The High Court bench led by Chief Justice Satish Chandra noted that they will pass appropriate orders.

Appearing in person, lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay filed the plea that the notifications by RBI and SBI in this regard are arbitrary, irrational and offend Articles 14 of the Constitution of India. He took the court through his plea.

Appearing for RBI, senior advocate Parag Tripathi urged the bench to dismiss the plea on the ground that the constitution bench of SC has time and again reiterated that they cannot interfere in the nation’s economic policies.

Tripathi further argued that withdrawing Rs. 2000 notes is not demonetisation but a statutory exercise, hence it is not a public issue.

The bench, on hearing both the parties reserved the case for judgment.

The petition said that a large amount of the currency has reached either an individual's locker or has ""been hoarded by the separatists, terrorists, Maoists, drug smugglers, mining mafias & corrupt people"".

The petition highlighted that cash transaction in high-value currency is the main source of corruption and is used for illegal activities like terrorism, naxalism, separatism, radicalism, gambling, smuggling, money laundering, kidnapping, extortion, bribing and dowry, etc. and the RBI and SBI should ensure that Rs 2,000 banknotes are deposited in respective bank accounts only.

""Recently, it was announced by the Centre that every family should have Aadhaar card and bank account. Therefore, why is RBI permitting to exchange Rs 2,000 banknotes without obtaining identity proof? It is also necessary to state that 80 crore BPL families receive free grains. It means 80 crore Indians rarely use Rs 2,000 banknotes. Therefore, petitioner also seeks direction to RBI and SBI to take steps to ensure that Rs 2,000 banknotes are deposited in a bank account only,"" the plea stated."

Khara, while addressing a post-results press conference said that for now, ECL is fiction. “ECL is fiction and if at all, it becomes a reality, we are very well equipped to deal with them without having any impact on our balance sheet.""

Under the ECL norms, banks will be required to classify their financial assets into three categories – Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3. The categorization has to be done on the bank’s assessment of any credit losses on the assets.

While highlighting that the bank is equipped to manage ECL norms, Khara also said the bank has a solid and protected balance sheet.

“We have always followed the principles to fully protect our balance sheet for any potential future events,” said Khara.

ECL norms by RBI

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) January 16, floated a discussion paper to move the banking system’s provisioning principles from the current ‘incurred loss’ approach to a new ECL approach. The step is under consideration to further enhance the resilience of the banking system, the central bank said.

As per the central bank, the current approach is inconsistent with the prudential separation of credit risk mitigation responsibilities assigned to capital and to provisions.

What this means is that since provisions are not maintained with a forward-looking perspective currently, a sudden trigger can prove to overburden and eat into the capital maintained by banks.

Also, delays in recognising expected losses worsened the downswing during the financial crisis of 2007-09, noted the paper. Thus, the RBI has proposed to move banks towards the new framework, in line with NBFCs.

The RBI is yet to announce the final guidelines on ECL norms."

“No one can predict with any certainty which way the next 1,000 points will be. Market fluctuations, while no means comfortable, are normal.” - Peter Lynch

The quote is relevant in the context of the wild swings the Nifty threw up over the last couple of months. The mood appears to have changed rapidly from pessimism to caution and then to cautious optimism and now bullishness. It has still not reached a stage of exuberance, which means that upswing may still have some steam left.

Decent set of quarterly earnings, record tax collections, low probability of RBI hiking rates and heavy FII purchases have tilted the game in favour of the bulls for now. Another couple of hundred of points of rally on the Nifty and that could again raise the question whether earnings growth is good enough to justify valuations.

SBI Card

The latest quarterly earnings are decent, just that they are not good enough to trigger the rerating that investors have been patiently waiting for. Higher cost of funds, increase in operating expenses and a lower revolver book (card users paying just the minimum amount due and carrying forward the rest) took some sheen off the numbers. A healthy revolver book is key to a credit card company’s earnings because that is where it earns the juicy margins. But with interest rates already high, fewer customers are carrying forward their outstanding.

“We expect the revolver mix to improve gradually; however, margin could remain under pressure as the borrowing cost is expected to increase further,” wrote Motilal Oswal analysts Nitin Aggarwal and Yash Agarwal in their note.

Car Trade

Even before the Paytm IPO bombed, Cartrade Tech’s public offer in September 2021 was the harbinger of trouble brewing for public offerings by new age businesses. The stock is trading at a fourth of its IPO price as the operating performance is trying to catch up valuations that still appear excessive. The fourth-quarter earnings show that things are improving slowly, but looks like the road to glory is still a long one.

In April last year, Kotak Institutional Equities and Nomura had turned bullish on the stock, but their positive reviews cut no ice with fund managers or wealthy individuals. And now Nomura has trimmed its price target for the stock by a good 20 percent to factor in a more realistic picture even as it has retained its buy rating.

“We lower target EV/sales to 6x (from 7x) for the classified business, in line with the correction at its domestic peers, and that for SAMIL (online vehicle transaction platform) to 4x (5x earlier), at the lower end of its likely range of 4-6x, as recovery seems to be taking longer than we had expected. We now don’t assign any premium to Absure business over classifieds, given the slower ramp-up.”

Cement

What was a price hike story till a quarter back has now turned into a volume game story as companies try to sell as much as they can. According to industry veteran Anil Singhvi, prices could be hiked next month or could even be delayed till October. Profit margins are still hurting from high fuel costs, and cement majors are hoping that prices stay at current levels. And the consolidation story—big players buying smaller companies—may not be playing out immediately. According to Singhvi, the big cement companies are looking to squeeze out existing capacity before they start acquiring fresh capacity.

Steel

It is a mixed picture for steel at this point. The good news is that coking coal prices are falling, providing relief to profit margins of steel companies. But the China demand story is not playing out as expected.

From the ICICI Securities report:

“Despite heathy credit indicators, we find Chinese steel demand remains elusive, resulting in sharp correction in international iron ore prices. Domestic hot rolled coil prices have slid by Rs 100/tonne week-on-week on an average as demand remains weak, particularly for longs. As per our channel checks, traders are waiting for price announcement by the major mills for May’23.”

Reverse swing

Crompton Greaves and IPCA took a pounding last week, falling 12 and 17 percent. The bruising fall appears to have drawn more bears to both stocks, who feel there is some more money to be made by going short. This has led to open interest in the futures of these stocks rising to more than double of the average of the last three months, at the beginning of the new series. From a fundamental perspective, both companies have little going in their favour at this point. But technicals could be another matter altogether. Derivatives traders say the huge bearish positions at the start of the series could indicate that the stocks could be close to making a near term bottom.

US inflation

Supply chain constraints may have eased, and the labour market too is showing signs of cooling. This has raised hopes that the Fed may start cutting rates earlier than expected. But author of the Greed and Fear newsletter Christopher Wood has warned that inflation could surprise, but not pleasantly.

From his piece:

“Last year’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with its uncapped subsidies, marks the biggest move GREED & fear has seen yet against the agenda of free market capitalism which the US is meant to believe in. The result will be an onshoring investment boom, which will be both inflationary and lead to a massive misallocation of capital. GREED & fear was interested to read a quote attributed to BlackRock chairman Larry Fink in a recommended pinko paper article this week that the Biden administration’s efforts to reshore manufacturing meant that US inflation was unlikely to fall below 4% “anytime soon”

EV’s Guinea Pig

The ‘green’ of electric mobility has some dark hues as well. The accelerated adoption of electric vehicles is having a knock-on effect on bauxite - the main source of aluminium, which in turn is a vital input for EVs due to its light weight and better thermal connectivity than steel. At the centre of the aluminium value chain lies Guinea – an impoverished West African nation that is blessed with the world’s biggest reserves of bauxite.

But this blessing has turned into a curse for thousands of locals. An investigation by The Washington Post, reveals that hundreds of square miles once used for farming have been acquired by mining companies, with villagers receiving little or no compensation. In the next two decades, according to a government study, more than 200,000 acres of farmland and 1.1 million acres of natural habitat will be destroyed by bauxite mining.

Rich Charlie's Almanack

For investors struggling to keep their morale (and portfolio) up in this listless market, here are some reassuring words from Charlie Munger himself. The 99-year-old investing legend, in an interview with FT, voiced a nagging suspicion most of us have had – things were actually better in the good ol’ days.

Reminiscing the times in late 1950s when he met Warren Buffett, Munger remarked: “We were a creature of a particular time and a perfect set of opportunities…a perfect period to be a common stock investor. We benefited by and large [from] low interest rates, low equity values, ample opportunities.” “It’s gotten very tough to have anything like the returns that were obtained in the past. [At] the exact time that the game is getting tougher we’ve got more and more people trying to play it.”

The global rating agencies, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch ratings on April 25 said they assigned ‘BBB-’ long-term issue rating to benchmark-sized notes that the London branch of State Bank of India (SBI) proposes to issue.

The US dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes will be part of the India-based bank's $10 billion medium-term note program, the agency said.

The proposed bonds or US dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes will be part of the India-based bank’s $10 billion medium-term note programme, the ratings agency said in a release.

“The proposed notes will constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured, and unsubordinated obligations of SBI, and shall at all times rank equally with all other unsecured obligations of the bank,” S&P Global said in a release said.

Further, Fitch ratings said these notes constitute its direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations and will at all times rank pari passu among themselves and with all of SBI's other unsubordinated and unsecured obligations.

The notes will be issued by SBI's London branch, Fitch added.

Earlier this month, the Executive Committee of the Central Board of SBI approved to examine the status and decide on long-term fundraising in single or multiple tranches up to $2 billion through a public offer and/or private placement of senior unsecured notes in US dollar or any other convertible currency during FY 2023-24."

A top Indian economist has rejected former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor Viral Acharya's assertion that the pricing power of India's large conglomerates is behind the high and persistent core inflation.

Writing in a report, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, State Bank of India's group chief economic adviser, said it would be ""factually incorrect"" to say that concentration of power in a few firms and the resultant pricing capacity explain elevated domestic core inflation.

""...the increase in prices during the pandemic was more on account of supply chain and logistical disruptions caused by the pandemic and after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine rather than firms increasing prices because of higher pricing power,"" Ghosh said in a report on April 24.

""It is thus incorrect to infer that concentration power dictated pricing capacity of firms and thus resulting in unyielding core inflation,"" he added.

In March, Acharya - now the CV Starr Professor of Economics at New York University's Stern School of Business - had authored a paper that said Indian consumers were not fully benefiting from the fall in input prices due to greater pricing power in increasingly concentrated industrial organisation structures.

""What lends some credibility to this thesis is the observation that in contrast to the rest of the world, India's core inflation is rising more in Goods, where its industrial sectors are increasingly concentrated, than in Services, though there are early signs of pricing power rising in the Services sector too,"" Acharya wrote. He went on to recommend that India should look to break up its large industrial firms ""by regulatory fiat or via competition commission diktat"".

Core inflation has been sticky around 6 percent for the better part of two years now, although it eased to 5.8 percent in March. In his paper, Acharya - who was a member of the RBI's Monetary Policy Committee from January 2017 to July 2019 - said the central bank's task of bringing down inflation has been ""rendered difficult by the persistence of elevated core inflation"".

However, an analysis of seven sectors - telecom, FMCG, two-wheelers, passenger vehicles, retail trade, and steel and basic metals - by SBI's Soumya Kanti Ghosh found that core inflation has been elevated over the last 2-3 years due to supply-side shocks rather than corporate pricing power.

On constructing a measure of inflation he termed 'CPI Industrial Concentration Index', Ghosh said the price rise as per this measure was less than core CPI inflation starting January 2015.

Source: SBI Research

""For a brief period beginning January 2020 till November 2020 and also further during the pandemic as supply disruptions weighed heavily, the estimated concentration CPI was higher than the core CPI,"" Ghosh added.

Ghosh's analysis also found that it is food inflation, not core inflation, which has been driving headline retail inflation.

""On average, 45,600 new firms were registered every year in India, in the period between 1980 and 2018. It vaulted towards 2 lakh (around 1.85 lakh per early estimates) in 2023. In principle, the number of firms formed during 2018-2022 has been much higher in comparison, with a spirit of entrepreneurship sweeping across the nation,"" Ghosh added."

Recently, the video of a senior citizen, Suryo Harijan, walking barefoot with the support of a broken chair to collect her pension from a bank in Odisha's Jharigaon village had gone viral.

However, according to local authorities and family members of the lady, she wasn't going to the bank but was returning from her daughter's house.

""The video was misinterpreted and the issue blown out of proportion,"" Kamal Lochan Mishra, Collector and District Magistrate of Nabarangpur, told Moneycontrol.

""The truth is the lady was coming from her daughter's house. Our block social security officer and programme assistant have taken the lady in the government vehicle to the SBI branch and dropped her back home,"" the Collector said.

Moneycontrol reached out to Suryo Harijan's granddaughter Tanuja Harijan, who confirmed the same. ""My grandmother was coming from our relative's house, not going to the bank,"" Tanuja Harijan said.

Block Social Security officer of Jharigam, Parthajit Mondal, also said, ""On April 14, Suryo Harijan was going from her daughter's house to Banuaguda village, a distance of about 2 km. As there was no other means of travel, she was forced to walk. The complete thing was false. The video was created by some local people.""

""The next day, on April 15, we went to her house and took her to the main SBI branch at Jharigam. On April 17, we again went to her house with the block development officer and the local MLA and gave her a wheelchair,"" Mondal added.

Anil Kumar Meher, the SBI Branch Manager, too said the reports were untrue. ""The old lady was coming from her daughter's house, not to the bank branch,"" he added.

Rupam Roy, General Secretary, All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC), condemned the reports. ""The AIBOC strongly protests the news report by ANI which maligned the SBI and showed public sector banks in a bad light,"" said Roy in a statement.

Following the reports, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had tweeted the video and expressed her concern about the situation, urging the authorities to act humanely and help the elderly woman.

Subsequently, the SBI said in a statement that the bank had taken remedial action.

“As per our laid down protocols, the nearest link branch, SBI Jharigaon, immediately paid the pension amount from the pensioner’s account. She has also been assured by the branch manager that going forward the pension will be delivered at her doorstep,” the bank statement added."

Indian fintech companies are aggressively hiring former top bankers and central bankers. In the last 24 months, at least 10 former bankers have joined the boards of fintech companies. Experts attribute this to a bigger corporate strategy to gain the trust of investors and customers, besides seeking smooth relations with regulators on compliance issues.

Such moves assume significance as fintech companies are facing tighter regulatory scrutiny on a range of issues related to corporate governance, lending norms, and the array of activities these companies can participate in.

For example, recently Bengaluru-based-Razorpay appointed N S Vishwanathan, former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as an advisor to the board. Also, the fintech company hired the former managing director (MD) of State Bank of India (SBI) and the former chairman of HDB Financial Services, Arijit Basu, as an advisor. Razorpay is one of the largest fintech companies in the country with operations in the payments segment. According to the company’s annual financial report, its operating revenue jumped 76.1 percent to Rs 1,481 crore in financial year 2021-22 (FY22) from Rs 841 crore in FY21.

Similarly, Bengaluru-based slice roped in former executive director (ED) of RBI, Eugene Emmanuel Karthak, as an independent director. The company also hired S Vishvanathan, ex-MD, SBI, for an advisory role, in March 2023.

Perhaps, one of the biggest such moves in the fintech space took place when BharatPe hired former SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar, and former RBI deputy governor B P Kanungo as non-executive chairman and independent director, respectively, in September 2022. Kumar is also an advisor to Gurugram-based digital lender Indifi Technologies.

There are other examples too. Delhi-based fintech company Stashfin appointed former MD and CEO of SBI Card, Vijay Jasuja, as a non-independent ED in September 2022, while EbixCash roped in Uma Shankar, former ED, RBI, as an independent director.

That apart, Qwikcilver, a digital gift card fintech company based in Bengaluru, appointed former RBI ED G Padmanabhan as an advisor in August 2016.

In March 2020, US-based cloud-service provider Salesforce hired former SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya as its India CEO.

Why are retired bankers in demand?

So, why are fintech company running to hire former bankers? According to experts, such hiring is part of a bigger corporate strategy to gain the trust of investors and customers, besides seeking smooth relations with regulators on compliance issues.

“Fintech companies have issues with regulatory requirements and business operations compliances. Industry experts can help mitigate these issues,” said Chandan Sinha, former ED, RBI.

Fintechs are a booming market. According to data from the government's Invest India portal, the Indian fintech industry's market size is expected to grow to $150 billion by 2025 from $50 billion in 2021. The sector is also expected to have $1 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and nearly $200 billion in revenue by 2023, data from Invest India said.

Also, the government has plans for growing and expanding the reach and innovation in the fintech sector.

The appointment of former bankers on the boards of company as advisors can help fintech companies get clarity on the business and operations aspects of the sector, experts said.

“Fintech companies are young and they have creative ideas. They need guidance on several issues,” said Rajnish Kumar of SBI.

Sinha said the experience of veteran bankers can help fintech companies formulate policies in the short to medium term.

Dealing with regulatory challenges

Over the last few years, the regulator has upped scrutiny on fintech companies.

RBI, in August 2022, introduced new guidelines for fintech companies operating in the digital lending space. Under the guidelines, fintech companies are required to disclose all costs upfront in a digital loan product to the customer, even as they are not allowed to scrub or read borrowers’ smartphones. In August 2022, ratings agency CRISIL highlighted that the new rules will raise the operational intensity and compliance costs for lenders in the near term.

Ajay Kumar Choudhary, ED, RBI, highlighted that the regulator has to keep a watchful eye on fintechs and the associated risks.

""Regulators need to keep a watchful eye on the risks by fintech companies and big techs. The risks posed by fintech start-ups and big techs are different,"" said Choudhary at the Moneycontrol Fintech Conclave.

For fintech companies, experts highlighted, the appointment of veteran bankers can help formulate operational tactics around regulatory issues. Ram Rastogi, Chairman of Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE) said that fintechs earlier did not look at governance and corporate aspects of the business.

“After the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) crisis, some of the major fintech players had to take a second look at their governance and compliance work. This is where they are looking at making policies clear and hiring banking sector experts,” Rastogi said.

Sinha said that sector experts can guide fintech companies on macro policies. “Fintech companies need to know what is permissible under their sector. They need a regulatory perspective on how to look at business,” Sihna said.

Former bankers in advisory roles

When former bankers join the boards of companies, they do not have a day-to-day role to play in the business of the fintech company. Instead, these former central bankers and chiefs of banks act as guides to these fintech companies.

According to experts, these bankers attend weekly or monthly meetings where major issues around the company’s operations are discussed.

“As an advisor or member of the board, they are not required to come or participate in the daily running of the company. They have to work as advisors or consultants discussing macro and major issues related to the company, such as scaling operations, regulatory aspects, etc.,” said Rastogi.

Sinha said the 30-40 years of sector experience of the bankers help them work around the bigger issues concerned with fintech companies.

“Veteran bankers have seen the ups and downs of business. Their experience can help fintech companies decide their growth plans,” said Sinha.

For instance, Kumar's tenure as the chairman of SBI ended in October 2020, following which he joined BharatPe, and later in 2022, also became an advisor to Indifi. Kumar, while highlighting his role as the advisor, said that most of the fintech companies are young at less than five to six years.

""As an advisor, we give them guidance. Especially, at this stage we give them advice not only on regulatory issues but also on compliance and other growth operations,"" said Kumar.

Alok Mittal, CEO of Indifi Technologies, said that hiring veteran bankers who have witnessed industry evolutions through the years help the fintech companies in adapting the business to new paradigms.

“Hiring former bankers and fintech experts can lead to a powerful combination towards growth. Our experienced bank heads provide insights on how to scale responsibly and mitigate risks,” Mittal added.

Some experts also suggested that when fintech companies hire a veteran banker, a certain goodwill also comes along.

“A veteran banker has a name and reputation in the industry. Hence, when they join a fintech company, there are chances that the fintech company develops a certain goodwill,” said Sinha."

A heart-wrenching video of a senior citizen walking barefoot with the support of a broken chair to collect her pension at a bank in Odisha's Jharigaon has gone viral on social media. The woman, identified as Surya Harijan, was struggling to withdraw money due to her broken fingers.

After the video was shared by news agency ANI, the State Bank of India (SBI) responded and assured the pensioner that her pension would be delivered to her doorstep going forward. The nearest link branch, SBI Jharigaon, Odisha immediately paid the pension amount by debiting the amount manually from her account.

The branch manager of SBI Jharigaon stated that Surya Harijan used to withdraw her old-age pension from a CSP point situated in her village every month. However, due to her old age, her fingerprints were not matching at the CSP point. She visited the Jharigaon branch with her relative, and the branch manager paid the amount by manually debiting her account. They have also decided to hand over a wheelchair to the elderly woman.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted the video and expressed her concern about the situation. She urged the authorities to act humanely and help the elderly woman. SBI responded to the minister, stating that they are equally pained to see the video and that they have resolved the issue by providing doorstep delivery of her pension and a wheelchair.

Karthak and Vishvanathan will join slice’s parent company Garagepreneurs Internet Private Limited (GIPL), slice said in a press release. This is a strategic move coming at a time of changing fintech governance norms and strict crackdown of lending apps by the regulators.

“Karthak will focus on providing strategic advice and promoting corporate governance and Vishvanathan will work on strategic decision-making,” slice said.

As a former ED, Eugene managed the banking regulation, supervision, Information Technology, financial inclusion, and currency management segments in RBI.

Vishvanathan led SBI as the MD and as director on the Central Board. Prior to that, he was the MD and chief executive officer (CEO) of SBI Capital Markets Limited.

slice also recently overhauled its product offerings to deliver comprehensive payments experience with products like slice borrow, slice mini, and slice UPI.

""The government has asked only major banks such as SBI, PNB, and BoB to submit data on their respective bond portfolios to check their status. It is also obvious that the government will not seek this information from banks that have small portfolios. These include Bank of Maharashtra, Punjab and Sindh, etc,"" told a source to Moneycontrol.

The move assumes significance as sharp value erosion in the bond portfolios of banks like Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in long-term securities had caused the crisis in the US, which led to the collapse of at least three regional banks in the US.

The State Bank of India (SBI), the country's largest public sector lender, will hike the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 70 basis points with effect from March 15.

The 0.7 percent jump in the key lending rate will push it to 14.85 percent.

SBI will also be raising its base rate by 70 bps to 10.10 percent effective from March 15. The lender had last made an upward revision in BPLR and base rate on December 15.

The hike has been announced by SBI a month after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised the repo rate, or the rate at which it lends short-term funds to commercial banks, to 6.50 percent from 6.25 percent.

While SBI has increased BPLR and its base rate, the bank has not made any changes to its marginal cost lending rate (MCLR), at which it lends out loans to customers.

SBI had last raised MCLR by 10 bps on February 15, which led to the overnight marginal cost lending rate increasing to 7.95 percent from 7.85 percent, and one-month and three-month MCLR rising to 8.10 percent from 8.00 percent, respectively.

The jump in lending rates is seen as a ripple effect of the rate hikes being implemented by the Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI since mid-last year, in a bid to tame inflation.

The countrywide retail inflation eased to 6.44 percent in February 2023, but continues to remain above the RBI's upper-level tolerance limit of 6 percent. This leaves the room open for further rate hikes by the central bank, as per experts."

While loans to this segment have been growing fast, defaults have thus far been few.

""We cannot have a system where we have a 20% growth year-on-year on MSME and retail and then an NPA (ratio) which will remain below 1% for retail,"" Ashwini Kumar Tiwari, managing director at State Bank of India said at an industry event in Mumbai. ""This is not sustainable, it has to align with the system.""

Gross non-performing loans for Indian banks fell to a seven-year low of 5% as of September 2022, according to the Reserve Bank of India's financial stability report. For the small businesses, the bad loans were higher at 7.7%.

The gross NPA ratio for the small and medium enterprises may rise to 10-11% by March 2024, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India and CRISIL Ratings said in a report released today.

These businesses often have weaker cash flows or little equity, which erode quickly in times of stress and eventually leads to defaults, SBI's Tiwari said. ""But clearly, MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) stress is something which might be coming.""

As of Dec. 31, Indian banks had around 19 trillion rupees or more than 14% of total loans as outstanding exposure to the MSME sector, as per the RBI data on sectoral deployment of bank credit.

A gross NPA ratio of less than 10% for MSMEs has been achieved largely on the back of write-offs and one-off resolution schemes, Tiwari said, flagging that it still remains a large number."

When it came to the list of stocks that analysts on the Street were most pessimistic about, information technology counters were the clear winners as four out of the five frontline large-cap IT stocks made it to the list. The list was however, topped by JSW Steel, as per Bloomberg's Analyst Call Tracker for January.

Strong credit growth sparks optimism

Optimism for banking stocks hinged on the strong credit growth and improved asset quality in the sector. Robust loan growth, strong recovery in demand for working capital and sustained asset quality which comforted lenders to lend more are the key factors behind the bullishness as stated by analysts.

Even though concerns of an economic slowdown in the country are running high, brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities does not expect much impact on the asset quality of banks. . ""We are seeing a strong recovery in loan growth after nearly a decade, suggesting that if there is a slowdown in

the near term, the impact on asset quality should be low,"" the brokerage said in its report.

""We shall keep our positive view on the sector, even if the probability of growth slowing down from current levels is high,"" Kotak Institutional Equities added.

Out of the 10 stocks that analysts were most optimistic about, 5 came from the financial space. State Bank of India, SBI Life Insurance Co, ICICI Bank, Housing Development Finance Corp and Axis Bank enjoyed optimism scores ranging from 95 to 98 as the sector cinched the throne of the Street's darling.

We define optimism scores as the percentage of sell-side analysts who have a “buy"" call on the respective stock.

Hindalco Industries emerges winner

The world's largest metal importer, China reopened its borders after three years which has sparked expectations of a demand revival and aided outlook for industry major Hindalco Industries.

Global research and broking firm CLSA Asia Pacific Markets believes that a faster reopening in China and stimulus for its battered property sector has provided a new lease of life for metal companies, although on-ground demand improvement is still elusive.

On account of the aforementioned reasons, CLSA was among the list of 24 brokerages that gave a Buy call for Hindalco Industries.

The broking firm also raised its price target for the aluminium major by 12.6 percent to factor in expectations of improved demand. All 24 brokerages covering Hindalco Industries have given a Buy rating to the stock, taking its optimism score to 100.

Pessimism clouds JSW Steel, IT stocks

January was yet another month when analysts failed to see a bright light around JSW Steel and other major IT counters. JSW Steel, Wipro and Divi's Laboratories were the top three stocks where analysts' pessimism ran the highest. Pessimism score refers to the percentage of analysts that have a ""hold"" or ""sell"" rating on the stock.

JSW Steel had the highest number of Sell ratings at 19, a number which is more than three times the number of Buy calls which stand at 6. Expensive stock valuations and higher levels of debt are the prime concerns dragging sentiment for the stock. Despite expectations of improved earnings due to the reopening of China, many analysts believe that expensive stock valuations will factor in any positive quarterly results for JSW Steel.

On the other hand, four frontline IT majors- Wipro, HCL Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services and Tech Mahindra also failed to garner much bullishness from analysts. As dark clouds of a possible recession in the US and Europe gather pace, concerns of a sharp slowdown in growth for domestic IT companies is weighing on the sector.

""After the 3Q results of IT companies so far, we expect aggregate revenue for Indian IT firms to sharply moderate in the next financial year. Our growth assumptions are lower than the street and as growth expectations moderate, further derating in PE multiples is likely as seen in the past. Moreover, the Nifty IT index is still trading at an above-average premium of 17% to the Nifty 50 as its valuations remain rich,"" Jefferies said in a note.

Index heavyweight Infosys remains the only IT stock that enjoys a Buy call from the global research and broking firm.

An unexpected participant

A surprise element in the list of stocks that garnered optimism among analysts on the Street was Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone. The stock had an optimism score of 95 as 20 out of the 21 brokerages covering the scrip had a Buy call.

Analysts were bullish on the stock as the company is the largest

commercial port operator in India with 25% share of port cargo movement in India.

""We upgrade Adani Ports to Outperform (from Neutral) based on attractive valuations post its recent correction. Strong underlying business with a robust growth outlook provide downside support,"" broking firm Credit Suisse said in its report.

Aside from Credit Suisse, Kotak Institutional Equities was another brokerage house that upgraded its rating for Adani Ports to factor in a favourable risk reward on the back of the recent landslide in the stock.

""Adani Ports is a strong play on India’s port sector, having attractive

characteristics – pricing power, prospects of privatization. The company also has a strong right to win in offering an end-to-end logistics offering,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in its report.

Another interesting fact to note is that despite their ratings upgrades, both Credit Suisse and Kotak Institutional Equities have slashed their respective target prices for the scrip. While Credit Suisse lowered its target price for Adani Ports by around 11 percent, Kotak Institutional Equities cut its target price by 6.5 percent.

PC Jeweller on February 7 said it has received loan recall notices from four lenders - IDBI Bank, Indian Bank, Bank of India and Karur Vysya Bank.

The Delhi-based jeweller, in a regulatory filing, noted that its legal proceedings with the State Bank of India (SBI), being held before the Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT), is underway. The next hearing will be held on February 28, it said.

""We also submit that the four other banks of the Consortium, namely IDBI Bank, Indian Bank, Bank of India as well as Karur Vysya Bank have also issued their loan recall notices to the company,"" the exchange filing added.

PC Jeweller further said that all of its showrooms, ""except three, namely, Preet Vihar, Pitampura and Kingsway Camp"", are operational. The three showrooms that are currently not operating are located in Delhi.

While announcing its second quarter results in September, PC Jeweller had informed the stock exchanges that it had defaulted on Rs 3,466.28-crore loan facilities from banks and financial institutions.

According to the company's last annual report, its lenders included both public and private banks, such as the SBI, Axis Bank, Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Induslnd Bank.

PC Jeweller's net profit during the second quarter stood at Rs 85.92 crore, as against a net loss of Rs 78.89 crore in the year-ago period. The results for the December 2022 quarter are yet to be declared.

State Bank of India's total loan exposure to the Adani Group is well-manageable for the public lender given its strong general provision reserves buffer of Rs 338 billion or 1 percent of net loans, CreditSights, a subsidiary of Fitch Ratings, said in a note on February 7.

SBI had disclosed that its total loan exposure to the Adani Group stood at 0.88 percent, or Rs 270 billion, of total loans as of the quarter that ended in December. Most of these loans are secured against cash-generating assets, and no loans against shares have been provided to the group.

""We see the level of exposure as well-manageable for SBI given its strong general provision reserves buffer (Rs 338 billion or 1 percent of net loans) and PPOP generation capability – the Rs 270-billion exposure is equivalent to 34 percent of annualised 9MFY23 PPOP,"" the credit researcher said in a note.

PPOP, or pre-provision operating profit, is the amount of income a bank earns in a given time period, before taking into account funds set aside to provide for future bad debts.

The report further noted that most of the bank’s exposure to the group is secured by completed and cash-generating assets, while the remaining are to projects that are still under construction and are on schedule.

""The bank also has some nonfunded exposure, but this comprises letters of credit and bank guarantees and does not relate to equity raising or acquisition activities,"" it said.

The SBI loan exposure to Adani Group came in focus after a report by an American short-seller, Hindenberg Research, alleged accounting fraud and stock market manipulation by the conglomerate. It hammered Adani Group stocks wiping over $100 billion from the market value.

Last week, SBI Chairman Dinesh Khara clarified that the bank does not envisage the ports-to-mining group facing any challenge to service its debt obligations.

Adding that the group has an excellent repayment record, Khara said that lending to Adani Group projects is with regard to having tangible assets and adequate cash flows.

SBI has reported net profit growth of 49 percent on-year to Rs 335 billion in the December quarter, driven by higher net interest income (NII) and lower provisions.

The stock fell over 10 percent in the week after the Hindenberg Research report was published on January 24."

""It is a serious concern that the central government allowed investment of public money, held by the LIC and SBI, in the Adani group. Common men are in for a great loss,"" state Congress president Rajesh Thakur said.

State Bank of India’s (SBI) Chairman Dinesh Khara, said the lender’s exposure to the Adani Group is pegged at Rs 27,000 crore or 0.8 to 0.9 percent of its loan book and repayments are on track, implying that there is no concern as of now.

“We have lent to Adani for projects which have tangible assets and have adequate cash collections. They are able to meet obligations. It is only 0.8-0.9 percent of our loan book,” Khara said at the press conference after announcing the bank's third quarter results.

Various companies of the Adani Group witnessed a massive fall in their valuation with their shares tanking between 20 to 35 percent.

Concerning the challenges with the loans, Khara said that SBI doesn't see any challenges in servicing the loans.

“We have not extended any loan against shares. The stock price will not impact our loans. As I mentioned, it is all against assets that are cash generating and have an excellent track record in repayments,” Khara said.

“We have not started any special engagement with the group yet. For the time being there is no concern,” Khara said.

Other banks' exposure

Bank of Baroda, another public sector bank, denied sharing the amount of its loan book exposed to the Adani Group. But Sanjiv Chadha, Managing Director, Bank of Baroda, on February 3, in a press conference after announcing the lender's quarterly results, said that the bank makes loans based on value sheets rather than shares.

""We give term loans or working capital, so it is more secure, and the banks' situation is different. I truly accept this when we give a loan to some company and there's an issue that can be an issue for us too. However, one company's problem had little impact. Banking for the corporate sector is at its best,"" Chadha said.

Concerning its exposure to the Adani Group, private sector lender IndusInd Bank in a statement on February 1 clarified its exposure.

In a statement it said: ""Bank's exposure towards this Group is as follows: 1. The total loan outstanding towards the Group is at 0.49 percent of the bank's loan book. 2. The total non-fund outstanding towards the Group is at 0.85 percent of the loan book. 3. The loan outstanding against fixed deposits of the Group is at 0.20 percent of the loan book. 4. Majority of the fund and non-fund exposures is working capital requirements and same is secured. 5. There is no other exposure outside of the above, inter alia, including towards any offshore entities, loan against shares or pledge of shares of promoter, investment book instruments etc. However, we hold shares as additional collateral for some of the exposures mentioned above, over and above the primary security provided."""

The State Bank of India (SBI) is expected to report a 58 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in net profit for the December quarter on the back of a drop in provisions, and a healthy 24 percent growth in net interest income.

The average estimate of a poll of eight brokerages by Moneycontrol puts SBI’s net profit at Rs 13,360 crore for the quarter, up from Rs 8,431.9 crore in the corresponding period a year ago. Net interest income (NII) is expected to be Rs 36,948 crore compared with Rs 30,687 crore a year ago. SBI will detail its quarterly results on February 3.

Analysts expect the bank’s interest income to be buttressed by robust loan growth and stable net interest margins (NIM). Analysts at ICICI Securities expect the loan growth to be 20 percent, while Kotak Institutional Equities is expecting a loan growth of 18 percent. Both the retail and corporate loan book may show strong expansion, according to analysts.

Stable margins may also contribute to the growth in net interest income. Kotak analysts estimate margins to improve by 10 basis points (bps) sequentially. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The lender’s loan mix, along with a large portfolio of low-cost current and savings deposits, should contribute to margin improvement.

“Forty-one percent of SBI’s lending portfolio is linked to MCLR, 34 percent is EBLR-linked, 21 percent is fixed rate, and the rest is BPLR, base rate, etc. Bulk of the MCLR-linked portfolio is with a six-month reset. Given this profile, while partial benefit of rate transmission was reflected in Q2FY23, the entire benefit should be visible in H2FY23,” analysts at ICICI Securities wrote in a note.

Asset quality

A drop in stressed assets (hence lower provisioning needs) is another contributor to the robust bottomline growth. Kotak estimates fresh slippages to be contained at around Rs 7,500 crore for the December quarter, and that too mostly from small business and retail loans. The corporate loan book is likely to be resilient. In the September quarter, SBI had reported slippages of Rs 2,399 crore.

Loan resolutions may ensure that upgrades and recoveries hold up, although these may slow sequentially. Upgrades and recoveries amounted to Rs 5,207 crore during the September quarter.

The lender’s provisions would be towards fresh slippages and to keep the coverage ratio elevated. Analysts do not foresee any large mark-to-market hit on the bank’s investment portfolio. This would ensure that operating profit growth is at a healthy 24 percent for the December quarter. Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher have increased their earnings estimate for SBI by 6.5 percent for the whole of FY23 in anticipation of lower provisions."

""LIC is public money! Post Hindenburg Report, the value of LIC investment in Adani Group shares have fallen from Rs 77,000 Crore to Rs 53,000 crore -- loss of Rs 23,500 crore.

""Also, LIC shares have lost Rs 22,442 Crore. Why is LIC still investing Rs 300 crore in Adani Group,"" Surjewala asked.

The Congress leader claimed that after the publication of the report, the SBI share's market cap has declined by a whopping Rs 54,618 crore.

Also, the loan exposure of SBI and other banks to Adani Group is Rs 81,200 crore, he claimed.

""The question is, why are SBI Employees Pension Fund and SBI Life still investing Rs 225 crore in Adani Group,"" Surjewala asked.

The Rajya Sabha MP also claimed that between January 24 and 27, the SBI and LIC lost a market cap of Rs 78,118 crore in value of their shares alone.

""The loan exposure of SBI and Invest Value decline of LIC in Adani Group is in addition thereto. Yet... RBI, SEBI, ED, SFIO, CBI, and the FM remain on 'mute' mode,"" Surjewala said in a series of tweets.

The Congress leader has earlier said that elsewhere ""the prime minister would be asked to explain, the finance minister would be sacked and a full investigation would have been ordered.""

Robust mobile and internet connectivity has helped India in a big way to expand financial inclusion, while a diverse network of banking correspondents and micro ATMs has ensured last mile reach, SBI Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said on Thursday.

Speaking at a session on ’Financial inclusion beyond access’ during the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2023 here, he also said a lot is being done in the country to spread financial and digital literacy to help people with their banking needs and to safeguard them from any frauds.

”We are a country of 1.3 billion and the mobile phone connections we have are about 1.2 billion. We also have some 800 million internet connections and that has helped us a lot expand financial inclusion,” Khara said.

”During the pandemic period, we also did another excellent job, that is distributing foodgrain also, rather than just distributing cash. That helped us contain inflation,” the SBI chairman said.

Khara said that his and other banks have created a robust system of digital banking that help people get access to their banking needs in real time. ”Beyond mobile phones also, we have a system of banking correspondents for last mile connectivity and to reach out to those without mobile phones. Besides, we have a huge network of branches, ATMs and micro ATMs,” he added.

”Still, we are not stopping at that and we continuously monitor the financial inclusion index at the apex regulator level. Financial literacy and digital literacy are other areas where we are focussing a lot to help people and to safeguard them from any frauds etc,” Khara said.

The country's largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), has hiked the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) on 1-year tenure by 10 basis points for home loans and others, with effect from 15 January.

MCLR is the minimum rate at which lending rates are calculated.

Details on SBI website showed that the MCLR on 1-year tenure is hiked to 8.40 percent from the previous 8.30 percent. MCLR on other tenures has been kept unchanged.

Since May, RBI has hiked interest rates by 225 basis points to fight inflation. One bps is one hundredth of a percentage point.

Following this, banks have passed on the rate hikes both in lending and deposit rates."

They said government transfers to the poor alone are adding up to Rs 75,000 per household per annum.

It can be noted that in the months following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns were being raised about deepening inequalities in India, with some calling it as a 'K-shaped' recovery, where rich emerged richer while the poor slipped down further.

After analysing data and studies, the SBI economists said, ""in hindsight, the pandemic may have been a leveller in terms of inequality with the poor getting protected through measures such as food transfers."" It said India has delivered a sharp recovery after the pandemic and acknowledged that critics are still quoting it as a K-shaped recovery for India.

""It is true that the strong rise in financial assets resulted in an increase in inequality in 2021. However, when correlated with short-run asset price movements, such fluctuations in inequality always prove transient,"" the report explained.

""In the Indian context, it is an incorrect conjecture to assume that inequality has worsened during the pandemic,"" it added, citing its study on how cereal procurement has helped reduce inequality.

The report said a higher procurement is benefitting the poorest of the poor in terms of subsequent free distribution of foodgrains, and also helping put money in the hands of smaller and marginal farmers, with distributional impact.

""With a progressive growth in output across states as proxied by GSDP, it is clear that the fruits of such a growth have clearly reverberated and dovetailed into an inclusive growth.

""India has thus done quite well during pandemic in terms of navigating income shocks across deciles of population,"" the study said."

Beleaguered telecom operator Vodafone Idea has approached a host of lenders to raise loans worth over Rs 7,000 crore, The Economic Times reported on January 6. Most part of it would be used to clear a portion of its dues to Indus Towers, the report said, citing three people aware of the matter.

A senior bank official told ET that Vi did approach them for a loan, but it is a logjam. The lender has not committed anything to the telco.

Reportedly, an official at another lender said Vi has asked them to factor in Rs 15,000-crore bank guarantees and grant fresh loans.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

The matter relating to loans and raising funds has reportedly been in discussion for a while as lenders have sought clarity on the government's potential shareholding in Vi, as well as the telco's business scale-up plans.

Mounting debt

According to the report, Vi's dues to Indus have mounted to around Rs 7,500 crore. Telco's monthly dues to the tower company are estimated at Rs 250-300 crore, it added. Co-owned by the UK's Vodafone Plc and India's Aditya Birla Group (ABG), Vi has committed the tower company to pay 100 percent of its current dues from January onwards, and also clear its outstanding as of December 31, 2022, starting this month.

Indus had earlier warned Vi that it would disconnect access to tower sites unless its payments were cleared. The telco had subsequently given the deferred payment proposal, which was accepted by the tower company.

ET’s queries to Vi and ABG were unanswered till the press time. Vodafone and Indus declined to offer comment. Queries to SBI, PNB, HDFC Bank and IDFC First did not elicit a response.

As of September 2022, Vi had a negative net worth of Rs 75,830.8 crore and the banking system cannot give loans to a company that has a negative net worth, one of the officials quoted above told ET. There was no guarantee that these loans would be repaid, he added.

On Thursday, shares of Vodafone Idea settled 0.77 percent higher at Rs 7.87 apiece on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex closed 304.18 points or 0.50 percent lower at 60,353.27."

State Bank of India (SBI), the country's largest lender by assets, said on January 3 that the executive committee of its Central Board has approved a plan to raise funds through the issue of infrastructure bonds worth up to Rs 10,000 crore during the financial year 2023.

The approval was given for “...raising Infrastructure Bonds up to an amount of Rs. 10,000 crores through a public issue or private placement, during FY23,” the bank said in an exchange filing.

On December 29, SBI said that the bank was waiting for regulatory approval to raise the Infrastructure Bonds.

Earlier in December 2022, SBI raised Rs 10,000 crore through its maiden infrastructure bond issue. The amount raised through the bonds is planned to be used to fund long-term infrastructure and affordable housing projects.

On January 1, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said that SBI, along with private sector lenders such as ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, continues to be Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) or institutions which are 'too big to fail'.

SIBs are perceived as banks that are 'too big to fail (TBTF)'. This perception of TBTF creates an expectation of government support for these lenders in times of distress. Due to this, these banks enjoy certain advantages in the funding markets."

Liquor worth over Rs 9 crore was sold across Noida and Greater Noida on December 30 and 31, an Excise department official said on Monday.

Gautam Buddh Nagar, adjoining Delhi in western Uttar Pradesh, sold liquor worth nearly Rs 140 crore in December alone, District Excise Officer Rakesh Bahadur Singh told PTI.

Of the total liquor sold in December, there were 1.5 lakh cans of beer, 8,900 bottles of foreign liquor, and 2.5 lakh (250 ml packs) of 'desi' (country-made) liquor, according to the officer.

""Total liquor sold on December 30 and 31 is estimated worth Rs 9 crore while the total liquor sale in the month of December 2022 stood at Rs 139.60 crore.

Within days of the finance ministry issuing a diktat against miss-selling, the State Bank of India (SBI) has asked its field officers to desist from forced selling of insurance products to its customers. In a communication to all public sector banks, the Department of Financial Services (DFS) had said there was an alarming increase in the number of complaints arising out of customers being forced to buy insurance products.

""We are confident that the circles must be fully adhering to the best practices and need based selling of insurance products, still there is an ongoing requirement of a strong emphasis and re-iteration of the zero-tolerance policy of bank towards any incident of mis-selling and forced selling to all operating functionaries,"" SBI said in a communication to all its chief general managers.

The bank asked the field functionaries to ensure that the branches conduct need-based selling of insurance products with strict compliance to the Assessment of Suitability and Appropriateness Framework (ASAF) and sourcing of business is undertaken for 100 per cent KYC compliant accounts.

The DFS letter to heads of public sector banks said it had received complaints that fraudulent and unethical practices are adopted by banks and life insurance companies for procuring policies from the bank customers.

There have been instances where life insurance policies were sold to customers aged above 75 years in tier-II and III cities.

Usually, branches of the banks push products of their subsidiary insurers. When resisted by customers, branch officials would sheepishly admit that they are under pressure from the top. Insurance products are pushed when customers go to seek any kind of loan or buy a term deposit. In this regard, the letter had said, the department has already issued a circular wherein it has been advised that a bank should not adopt restrictive practices of forcing customers for getting insurance from a particular company."

Since these indices are tracked majorly by domestic passive funds and ETFs, the recapping leads to a change in funds flow. While the adjustment will take place today, the changes will become effective only on December 30.

In the Nifty 50, scrips of Adani Ports, HDFC Life and HDFC Bank/ICICI Bank are set to see inflows of $11 million, $9 million and $4 million, respectively. Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC and Tech Mahindra might see outflows of $12 million, $9 million and $3 million, respectively.

HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank will also see incremental inflows due to weightage increase in the Nifty Bank index of $25 million and $22 million. IndusInd Bank and Federal Bank are next in line, anticipating $19 million and $10 million inflows.

Axis Bank's weightage will go up in the Nifty 50 index but come down in the Bank Nifty resulting in a cumulative outflow of $57 million. SBI's weightage in Bank Nifty will come down 10.2 percent from 11.1 percent, resulting in an outflow of $32 million.

The final between Argentina and France is being billed as a battle between Lionel Messi and fellow Paris Saint-Germain player Kylian Mbappe.The players occupy the top ranks on the FIFA charts, with five goals each.

Messi will be fighting hard to win the first World Cup for Argentina since Maradona, while France will play to retain its winning title. It could make history as the first country to do so in 60 years.

State Bank of India (SBI) on Wednesday said its board has approved Rs 10,000 crore capital raising plan through Tier I bonds.

The fund raising through Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital up to an amount of Rs 10,000 crore is subject to Government of India concurrence, the bank said in a regulatory filing.

The Central Board accorded an approval for raising capital by way of issuance of Basel III compliant debt instrument in INR and/or any other convertible currency, up to FY24, it said.

The fund would help the bank grow its loan book.

Last week, SBI had announced that its personal banking advances, excluding high value home loans, have crossed the Rs 5 lakh crore-mark.

The EMI will amount to Rs 22,682.

Country's largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) wrote off loans worth Rs 1.65 lakh crore in last four fiscal years followed by Punjab National Bank (PNB) which wrote off Rs59,807 crore, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed the Parliament on December 12.

SBI wrote off Rs 19,666 crore loans in fiscal year 2021-2022, Rs 34,402 crore in 2020-21, Rs 52362 crore in 2019-20 and Rs 58905 crore in 2018-2019, according to the data submitted by the finance minister.

Banks typically write off loans where there is no scope of recovery . Banks need to set aside money to cover potential losses from such loans. This impacts the profitability of banks.

The borrowers of written-off loans continue to be liable for repayment and the process of recovery of dues from the borrower in written-off loan accounts continues. Banks continue to pursue recovery actions initiated in written-off accounts through various recovery mechanisms.

According to the data submitted by the minister, PNB wrote off Rs 59,807 crore loans in last four fiscal years, followed by IDBI Bank which wrote off Rs33,135 crores of loans. Among private sector banks, ICICI Bank wrote off Rs42,164 crores of loans while HDFC Bank wrote off Rs31,516 crore loans.

Loan write offs have significantly contributed to the decline in bank NPAs over years. According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) financial stability report for June 2022, the gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio of banks fell to six-year low of 5.9 percent in March 2022.

The primary dispute is about whether the new owners of Jet Airways need to pay more money into the pension funds of ex-employees, the people said, asking not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.

Banks, led by State Bank of India, say Jet Airways’ new buyers — Dubai-based businessman Murari Lal Jalan and Florian Fritsch, chairman of London-based Kalrock Capital Management Ltd. — should pay an additional 2.5 billion rupees ($30.1 million) into the retirement kitty, the people said, an ask supported by the email exchanges reviewed by Bloomberg.

The new owners meanwhile have indicated that extra money wasn’t part of the already agreed upon resolution plan and instead must be taken out of the banks’ dues, the people said. All parties are now awaiting fresh guidance from the bankruptcy court due Tuesday, the people said.

A representative for Jet Airways, which also represents the consortium led by Jalan and Fritsch, declined to comment. State Bank of India and Ashish Chhawchharia, the court-appointed professional running the carrier’s insolvency, didn’t immediately respond to messages and phone calls seeking comment.

A revival of Jet Airways, previously majority owned by former billionaire Naresh Goyal, is key to burnish the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is projecting himself as a market-friendly leader keen to reduce state interference in private enterprise ahead of elections in 2024.

For Jet Airways, a second coming could exemplify how new bankruptcy rules can allow beleaguered carriers to spring back in the South Asian nation, known for its cut-throat aviation market and fare wars that have killed off several high profile players over the years.

Jet Airways collapsed in 2019 under a lot of debt after years as India’s top private airline. It had promised to start flying again in March this year but has struggled to order new aircraft because lenders have been reluctant to take on fresh liabilities. Its new owners also still haven’t reached an agreement about formally taking over the airline, the people familiar with the matter said, limiting the ability of Jalan and Fritsch to infuse more funds and order planes.

The issue of paying more money into the pension funds of former employees came about after a fresh case was filed at the tribunal after the court-approved resolution had been finalized.

The snag also threatens to set back a process of about three years that was to see banks recover about 5% of the some 78.1 billion rupees they were owed.

Bloomberg News reported in late August that Jet Airways was in advanced talks to order about 50 Airbus SE A220 aircraft. The carrier was also in discussions with Boeing Co. and Airbus to potentially place a “sizable” order for the 737 Max or A320neo families of jets. All those discussions are now stuck due to this latest dispute, one of the people said.

Another point of contention is whether ownership should be transfered to the new owners before a court rules on the current pending matters. Banks aren’t willing to let that happen and Jalan and Fritsch aren’t willing to put in any more funds until they know when they’ll actually be in control of the airline, the emails show.

Still another wrinkle centers around a dispute over Jet Airways’ landing and parking slots at airports in India and overseas. Banks want Jalan and Fritsch to confirm the slots but Indian regulators aren’t making that possible until there is more clarity on Jet Airways’ fleet, according to the emails.

To date, Jalan and Fritsch have spent about 7.6 billion rupees in their attempts to get Jet Airways flying again, the emails show."

Morgan Stanley strategists feel that the state-owned banks have done well, and expect continued strong performance helped by higher margins, sustained loan growth and improving operating leverage over the next few years.

""Over the past two years, Indian banks have seen sharp moderation in new NPL (Non-Performing Loan) formation, which, coupled with increased NPL coverage during COVID, has resulted in sharp moderation in credit costs. In recent quarters, this has been followed by sharp improvement in margins, helped by a rising rate cycle - higher rates, coupled with retail funded balance sheets and higher shares of repo-linked loans, have led to up-front margin expansion in the current cycle. Loan books have yet to be fully repriced, which implies that margins might expand further before, then moderate in F24,"" the global research firm said in a report.

Catch all the market action on our live blog

""We expect loan growth to be sustained and credit costs to remain benign over the next few years. We expect current loan growth to be sustained as capex spending accelerates. The capex cycle should, in turn, foster job

creation, accelerate income growth, and drive more growth opportunities even in the retail and SME segment,"" it said.

""Against this backdrop, we expect the credit cycle to remain benign and see credit cost undershooting over the next few years,"" it said.

While the strategists believes that the State Bank of India (SBI) remains the best state-owned bank, they see potential for notably higher stock returns in Bank of India and Bank of Baroda due to much cheaper valuations. ""We have raised earnings estimates and valuation multiples for non-SBI state-owned banks as we expect continued strong cyclical tailwinds.""

At SBI, the research firm had already built these benefits given a better balance sheet and execution over past two years. As the cyclical recovery is sustained, it expects benefits to percolate to non-SBI state-owned banks as well. ""We compare these banks on capital, asset quality, profitability and liquidity. Bank of India and Bank of Baroda offer the best risk reward, followed by SBI,"" Morgan Stanley said.

These bonds can be purchased by a person who is a citizen of India or incorporated or established in India. This is the 24th tranche of bonds to go on sale.

“State Bank of India (SBI), in the XXIV Phase of sale, has been authorised to issue and encash Electoral Bonds through its 29 Authorized Branches (as per list enclosed) w.e.f. 05.12.2022 to 12.12.2022,” the finance ministry said in a statement on December 3.

New Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Shimla, Dehradun, Kolkata, Chennai, Patna, Guwahati, Srinagar, Gandhinagar, Bhopal and Raipur are some the cities where SBI branches have been authorised to sell electoral bonds.

This is the third successive month that poll bonds are being sold. The 23rd tranche opened for subscription from November 9 to 15 and in October, these were available for sale from the first of the month to the tenth.

The bonds will be valid for 15 calendar days from the date of issue and no payment shall be made to any payee political party if these are deposited after the expiry of the validity period, the ministry said.

The bond deposited by an eligible political party in its account shall be credited on the same day, the statement added. The bonds shall be encashed only through a bank account with the authorised bank.

The bonds go on sale a day ahead before the Supreme Court is to take up challenges to the scheme, which petitioners have described as opaque and claim it hampers free and fair elections.

The petitioners also want the Chief Justice of India to set up a bigger constitutional bench to hear the matter.

The government has said the bonds are transparent as the whole process of money transfer can be tracked and there is no way that black money can be routed through this scheme."

Public sector banks have been in huge demand in recent months, thanks in part to their improving financial performance but Saurabh Mukherjea, the founder of Marcellus Investment Managers, is not a fan.

“For a typical public sector bank, the return on equity is consistently below the cost of equity, which means value generation is zero. And that’s reflected in the five-year and 10-year share price movement, which is zero,” Mukherjea told Moneycontrol.

The Nifty PSU Bank index, a representative measure of public sector bank shares, has advanced 55 percent so far in 2022, with most of the gains kicking in since September. However, it delivered only a 6 percent return over the past five years.

Many PSU Banks, especially State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank, have delivered superlative quarterly numbers in the September quarter, riding on better credit growth and higher recoveries. A decline in bad loans also improved their outlook.

However, the trend hasn’t been consistent. Most lower-tier banks such as Punjab National Bank are still plagued with high levels of toxic debt. The market has disregarded this and has bought PSU banks indiscriminately.

Mukherjea said the returns look respectable in the short term because prices had plunged significantly during Covid-19. But public sector banks have not made money in the long run, he said.

Some value

However, he is not bearish on every public sector bank. He sees some value in SBI, which reported better-than-expected earnings in the September quarter. The lender has improved its performance consistently over several quarters and its stock has also appreciated.

“I think a lot of credit should go to Arundhati Bhattacharya (the former chairperson of the bank) for improving the efficiency and quality of the bank,” said Mukherjea. “Will SBI continue doing well, going forward? I think so because the worst excesses of crony capitalism seem to be behind us. Provided the kind of mass destruction of the SBI balance sheet, which happened a decade ago, doesn't happen again, I think SBI should be a decent compounder going forward.”

Mukherjea, who is heavily invested in HDFC Bank via the funds he runs, will not be buying PSU banks, including SBI, because he does not see them compounding at a rate of 20 percent, which is his threshold.

Other PSUs ‘fragile’

Mukherjea refuted the notion that the quality pack, which refers to companies that rely on traditional business models to consistently generate high cash and return ratios, may see some kind of moderation compared to cyclical or public sector companies.

In the past 12 months, such quality plays have not performed well when compared to public sector institutions, whether they make defence equipment or give loans, which have had a great run.

“I can't deny that,” said Mukherjea, adding that he still stays away from such companies because there is “no business engine” there. While they might be having their moment in the sun, it will not be long term, according to him.

“If you take a typical public sector institution, the return on capital (RoC) will be significantly below cost of capital. If your RoC is below cost of capital, whether you are a metal and mining company or a public sector company, you're not generating a surplus. If you can’t generate a surplus, you cannot grow your business,” he said.

The star fund manager said he continues to focus on companies that generate cashflows.

“The basic tenet of investing is to look for companies which make free cashflow. And then if they become cheap, buy tons of it,” he said.

Chairman of the country’s biggest lender State Bank of India (SBI) Dinesh Khara on Saturday asserted that analysts and broking houses are praising the financial performance of the bank which reported its highest profits recently.

For the first time, SBI registered the highest-ever profits recorded by any corporate house, Khara said. ”In the recent quarterly results, the bank’s profits are the highest ever. SBI crossed the highest ever profits recorded by any corporate and analysts and broking houses are praising this,” he said.

In the second quarter of the current financial year, the net profit of the lender stood at Rs 13,265 crore, higher by 74 per cent compared to the previous similar period. Naming broking houses, he said, ”Motilal Oswal Securities had stated SBI is in a cruising mood.

ICICI Securities said that SBI is firing on all cylinders”.Khara said that SBI is a ”proxy to the Indian economy. This is so as the bank gets the patronage of 47 crore customers and is practically a banker to every household”.With India already becoming the fifth largest economy, he said perhaps by 2027, the country would be the third largest in terms of the size of the economy. But, Khara also said that there is a need for improvement in customer service as there are many options available today.

The SBI chairman said that customer expectations are changing and the bank needs to solicit and walk up to their doorsteps.”We have improved customer service, but have miles to go. Banking has now become a knowledge sector. We need to package offers what the customers are looking for,” he stated.

During the peak of the pandemic, SBI had rendered continuous service to the customers, he said, adding that there had also been a shift in their behaviour in going to the digital mode. ”SBI has invested in technology, and the bank’s app YONO had helped in generating business and offering services in a frictionless manner,” he added. Khara said that there is a need for punctuality in opening up the branches of the bank as well."

State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara on Wednesday exuded confidence that the country's largest lender will be able to maintain its performance on asset quality even amid high loan growth.

He said SBI, which won investors' confidence after posting stellar quarterly earnings recently, will be able to maintain net non-performing assets under 1 per cent going forward as well.

Speaking at an economics conclave organised by SBI, Khara also exuded confidence that the country's banking system will be able to maintain its high loan growth as banks have internalised learnings from the last high growth cycle.

In the last high growth cycle immediately after the global financial crisis, there was a huge spurt in sour loans, and it took the RBI's intervention to clean up banks' balance sheets through asset quality review.

Banks do not stop just at insistence on equity, but also look at the colour of the equity to ensure that hybrid debt does not masquerade as core equity, Khara said, stressing that banks are better placed from a loan underwriting and pricing of risk perspective now.

The decision-making is more scientific and banks are also well capitalised now, he said, adding, ""the banking system is much better placed, growth that we are seeing is sustainable too"".

The banking system, which had struggled to take the annual growth into double digits for multiple years, witnessed a credit growth of 17 per cent for the fortnight ended November 4.

SBI had been focused on corporate loan quality for some time now, and has also started a system where it gets early signals about distress in a retail loan as well courtesy a strong analytics engine, he told reporters.

Khara said corporates are also deleveraged, unlike the last instance when their balance sheets had huge loans, he said. In the case of SBI, he said the bank is carrying provisions for over 90 per cent of its corporate loan book.

When quizzed about the current war for deposits, he said lenders which are running high credit-deposit (CD) ratios of over 75 per cent are forced to give high interest of over 8 per cent to garner deposits. He said that SBI's CD ratio is 65 per cent.

He said banks are also carrying excess government security investments, which can be liquidated to bridge the liquidity needs, and ensure that the productive sectors get loans.

Changes in the ecosystem are proving of big help to the lenders, Khara said, pointing to strengths like bankruptcy code, Goods and Service Tax Network data, ratings ecosystem and credit bureaus.

The expectation is to grow the GDP to USD 40 trillion by 2047, which Khara termed as a ""mammoth task"".

The focus is on infrastructure-led growth during this period, he said, adding that building this requires deep debt markets which are not present in India right now.

Khara said the country's banks and the alternative mechanisms like the GIFT City will have to play a significant role in the time ahead to help the overall growth."

The banking system is a proxy for the Indian economy. How strong the real economy is will get reflected in the banking system as well, said Dinesh Khara, the SBI Chairman, at the 9th SBI Banking & Economics Conclave.

CNBC-TV18's Shereen Bhan spoke to the panellists at the event about the road ahead for the Indian economy. Besides Khara, the panel comprised L&T CFO Shankar Raman; Managing Director of Crisil Ratings Gurpreet Chhatwal; CEO of Technocrat Navneet Kumar Saraf; Joint MD of JSW Steel Seshagiri Rao; and Founder and CEO of Jupiter Jitendra Gupta.

Khara said in the current fiscal year, India is standing as the brightest star across the globe and the same is being replicated in the performance of the banking sector.

Chhatwal spoke about the bond market, which has been a bit of a challenge for the last 18 months. ""Today, banks are doing the heavy lifting, we are creating building blocks within the bond market for that growth,"" he said, adding that the bond markets have matured significantly in terms of investors that are coming in, the quality of paper that is coming in, the infrastructure financials, etc.

Raman said India is in a unique place in terms of growth. ""We went through the turmoils of the last two years rather well. That has given us a sense of self belief,"" he said. Everyone believes that India is in a good position to dream about its aspirations over the next 25 years, he added. ""The name Amrit Kaal is fitting because it does say how we feel about India,"" he said.

Saraf and Rao spoke about India's role as manufacturers. Rao said this is the first time the manufacturing sector is being used to its hilt —it is at a three-year high. ""When the manufacturing sector is creating capacity in India, it is not only for India it is also for export markets,"" he said, adding that when countries across the globe are concerned about recession, India is growing at the rate of 6-7 percent.

Saraf said for India to achieve its target of $5-trillion GDP in the next three years, export competitiveness would play an important role. ""With the China + 1 policy that is prevalent, I think it is a great opportunity for India to expand manufacturing exports,"" he said, adding that better availability of raw material would help.

Gupta said for India to cross $40 trillion by 2024, support from non-linear growth (internet economy) is just as important compared to linear growth (infrastructure, exports, manufacturing, etc). He felt that the digitisation of infrastructure currently on — with the introduction of 5G — would give a clear boost to the $40-trillion goal."

The Pune-headquartered lender recorded 28.62 per cent increase in gross advances at Rs 1,48,216 crore at the end of September 2022, according to published quarterly numbers of public sector banks (PSBs).

It was followed by Union Bank of India with 21.54 per cent growth to Rs 7,52,469 crore. The country's largest lender State Bank of India stood at third spot with 18.15 per cent jump in gross advances.

However, SBI's total loans were about 17 times higher at Rs 25,47,390 crore as compared to Rs 1,48,216 crore of BoM in absolute terms.

With regard to Retail-Agriculture-MSME (RAM) loans, BoM recorded the highest growth of 22.31 per cent followed by Bank of Baroda with 19.53 per cent and SBI at 16.51 per cent during the period under review.

As far as low-cost Current Account Savings Account (CASA) deposits are concerned, BoM topped the chart with 56.27 per cent followed by Canara Bank at 50.99 per cent.

BoM and SBI with 3.55 per cent Net Interest Margin (NIM), a key profitability parameter, stood at the top among PSBs. It was followed by Bank of India at 3.49 per cent and Central Bank of India at 3.44 per cent.

BoM and SBI were in the lowest quartile as far as gross non-performing assets (NPAs) and net NPAs were concerned, according to an analysis of the quarterly financial numbers published by public sector lenders.

As per the analysis, gross NPAs reported by BoM and SBI were 3.40 per cent and 3.52 per cent of their total advances, respectively, in the second quarter. Net NPAs of these banks came down to 0.68 per cent and 0.80 per cent, respectively, at the end of September 2022.

State Bank of India has never had it better when it comes to investor love. The stock has zoomed 15 percent in three months, outpacing the broad market and leaving its peers far behind.

This is not irrational exuberance – it is an acknowledgement of the country’s largest lender finally shaking off the shackles of bad loans and going full throttle on lending.

With growth comes the need for capital to fund it and this is the next stage that analysts say will be critical for another rerating of the SBI stock.

SBI has a ‘buy’ rating from almost all brokerages, with most of them having rerated it in the past two years. Despite the scorching gains so far, the shares trade at a modest 1.5 times the one-year forward book value.

“For SBI, most of the positives have been priced in but there is still a lot of upside for the stock,” said Gaurav Jani, an analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher.

That brings us back to the factor that will determine how fast SBI can hold on to its valuation gains and surge even further ahead.

Drop some money

SBI’s capital adequacy ratio was 13.51 percent in September, higher than the regulatory requirement of 12 percent and marginally above 13.35 percent a year ago.

Note that during this time, the lender’s toxic loan book dropped sharply, lowering its provisioning needs. It also raised capital from the bond market.

SBI’s quarterly profits have risen consistently. Still, the rather modest increase in its capital ratio shows credit growth has burned through most internal accruals.

What’s more, chairman Dinesh Khara expects this loan growth momentum to continue, depending on the strength of the economy’s expansion. He has pencilled in loan expansion of as much as 16 percent for FY23.

Long story short, SBI needs to raise capital and analysts at JM Financial gauge that the money should come over the next 1-2 years.

The capital must be Tier-1 because the bank’s Common Equity Tier-1 capital ratio is at 9.53 percent, against a minimum requirement of 8.6 percent.

“While SBI may need to raise equity capital over the next 12-24 months (CET1 at 9.5%), stake sale in subsidiaries (SBI Funds, SBI General Insurance) remains another option to augment capital and may delay the eventual dilution,” JM Financial analysts said.

But Khara poured hot water over the prospects of a stake sale by saying recently that the listing of SBI Mutual Fund is now on the backburner. There is no clarity on whether the general insurance arm will go public.

Mind the deposit gap

SBI’s deposit growth (10 percent) was just half of its loan growth (20 percent) for the September quarter. This should worry the bank on its liquidity position and its ability to lend with the same gusto that it does now.

If the 10 percentage point gap between credit and deposit growth persists, it could significantly crimp the bank’s ability to lend.

Granted, the bank’s deposit franchise is unparalleled and its ‘Safe bank of India’ tag will ensure a steady inflow. But the question is whether this is enough.

What helps SBI on liquidity is its practice of keeping a big buffer through liquid assets such as government bonds. Its liquidity coverage ratio at 132.6 percent instils confidence. Even so, the wide wedge between deposit and loan growth underscores the need for growth capital.

The prospects of the country’s largest bank are bright in the capital market and analysts see valuations only improving from here on. The comparatively modest multiples only make SBI a more appealing stock to buy.

Since some of this is also due to an uncertainty premium that sticks to large and safe businesses, SBI needs to sustain its growth and profitability momentum.

A capital boost ensures this or else the elephant is dancing but on a tin can!"

The state-owned lender said its net profit surged 74 percent from a year earlier on improved asset quality and healthy loan growth. Its net interest income rose 12.83 percent to Rs 35,183 crore for the reported quarter, keeping with the improving trend of the previous two quarters. Nomura has a buy call on the stock with target raised to Rs 690 per share.

State Bank of India has pencilled in lower current account deficit at 3 per cent for this fiscal as against the minimum consensus of 3.5 per cent, citing rising software exports, remittances and a likely USD 5-billion jump in forex reserves via swap deals.

Every USD 10 increase in crude prices impacts the Current Account Deficit (CAD) to the tune of 40 basis points while the same on fuel inflation is 50 bps and also results in 23 bps decline in growth, according to Soumyakanti Ghosh, the chief economic advisor at SBI.

CAD has a counter cyclical shock absorber, he said in a report on Thursday. Exchange rate is the major contributor to software exports growth and 40 per cent of its variation is explained by exchange rates.

”If we translated these numbers in actual terms, every Re 1 fall against the dollar leads to an increase in software exports by USD 250 million”. This, along with an expected USD 5 billion-forex reserve accrual by way of swap transactions and higher remittances, will cap CAD at 3 per cent of GDP as against the average lowest level projected for the year at 3.5 per cent, Ghosh said.

The strong remittances and software exports have lowered CAD by 60 bps in the June quarter, adding that if this trends continued in the September quarter, then CAD would be below 3.5 per cent in the second quarter and at 3 per cent in the full fiscal.

Even otherwise, the chances of it exceeding 3.5 per cent of GDP are minimal, he added. According to Ghosh, forex reserves, which have declined from USD 642 billion in September 2021 to just about USD 531 billion last week, are expected to rise by USD 5 billion as swap transactions reverse.

The biggest impact on CAD is oil imports, which form as much as 30 per cent of the country’s import bills. Therefore, any increase in oil price has a direct impact on the trade deficit by increasing the import bill and consequently widening the CAD.

Software exports have been rising with the share of offsite mode of exports of software services by domestic IT services companies soaring to 88.8 per cent in FY22 from 82.8 per cent five years ago.

Ghosh said that a positive shock to oil prices leads to immediate and sharp increase in CAD but the same dissipates completely in about eight quarters. In case of GDP, positive fall in oil prices leads to immediate decline which, however, starts reversing after three quarters and completely dissipates after the seventh quarter."

Amidst liquidity tightening and a decadal high credit growth of over 18 per cent and deposit growth falling way behind, a report has warned that banks are not adequately pricing their risks from both asset and liabilities sides.

Liquidity crunch is primarily because the Reserve Bank has been sucking out funds from the system as it fights to tame inflation which has been much above its band of 4 per cent for the past 10 months of the year.

This has prompted the RBI to frontload its inflation fight by increasing the policy rates by 190 basis points to pre-pandemic levels since the war on Ukraine began.

The average net durable liquidity injected into the banking system in April 2022 was Rs 8.3 lakh crore, which is nearly a third of that now at Rs 3 lakh crore.

Atop this, the government has spent a large part of its cash balances in the Diwali week, and as a result the net LAF (liquidity adjust facility) in the system, which was hitherto negative, has improved of late. Bonus payments by the government and the private sector also helped.

Even as the banking system has moved closer to a calibrated liquidity coupled with higher signaling rates, one thing has still not changed is that credit risks are not getting adequately priced in, even as credit demand is at a decadal high and liquidity remains significantly downsized, argues Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the group chief economic adviser at the State Bank of India, in a report.

According to the report, what is still intriguing, however, is that even as the banking system is witnessing net LAF deficit, market sources point out that risk premia over and above core funding cost are not fairly acknowledging the inherent credit risk.

For example, short tenor working capital loans for less than one year are given at lower than 6 per cent and are linked to one-month/three-month T-bill rates, while 10- and 15-year loans are being priced at less than 7 per cent.

It is to be noted that 10-year G-Sec is currently trading around 7.46 per cent, while the 91-day T-bill is trading at around 6.44 per cent and 364-day T-bill at around 6.97 per cent.

The average core funding cost of the banking system is at around 6.2 per cent now, while the reverse repo rate is at 5.65 per cent. No wonder, banks are currently engaged in a fierce war to raise deposits, with rates being offered up to 7.75 per cent in select maturities.

Additionally, banks are now mobilising certificates of deposit (CDs) at rates as high has 7.97 per cent for a 360 days paper. Further, a few banks have raised CDs at 7.15 per cent for 92 days.

Thus a significant part of the funding gap is also being made up by CD mobilisation. The outstanding CDs stood at Rs 2.41 lakh crore on October 21, compared to just Rs 0.57 lakh crore a year ago.

The CP market is also witnessing significant churn with primary issuances of the short-term paper coming down drastically to Rs 0.78 lakh crore after touching a high of around Rs 2.9 lakh crore in November 2021.

The yields have also increased by 255 basis points (bps) since April 2022 and was at 6.92 per cent in October 2022, he says in the report.

The report also notes that the good thing is that such pricing war for both fund raising and lending is mostly restricted to AAA-rated borrowers and ultimately it should also lower the risk weighted assets thereby lowering the capital requirements.

To nudge large borrowers to move towards corporate bonds market, the RBI had mooted the idea of normally permitted lending limit (NPLL) for them. But the current pricing trend is negating both this concept as well as the logic of tenor premium. Ideally, benchmark yields should move down if the risk is underpriced.

Interestingly, banks have adjusted deposit rates significantly upwards in October. Also, given that 45 per cent of bank deposits are the low-cost CASA (current account savings account), it is only the 55 per cent of the term deposits that need adjustments and hence ideally, the 190 bps increase in the repo rate could result in 105 bps increase in the deposit rates of the latter category.

Banks with better franchise and digital orientation will ensure that retail deposits triumph over wholesale deposit mobilisation in the long-run, coupled with the fact that meeting the liquidity coverage ratio or the LCR norms is the exclusive prerogative of mobilising only through retail deposits."

Investors lapped up shares of State Bank of India (SBI) on November 7 after the company reported a strong, all-around performance for the quarter ended September 2022, leading to earnings well above what analysts had estimated.

The state-owned lender said its net profit surged 74 percent from a year earlier on improved asset quality and healthy loan growth. Its net interest income rose 12.83 percent to Rs 35,183 crore for the reported quarter, keeping with the improving trend of the previous two quarters.

Credit growth during the quarter was remarkable, beating even some of the top private banks. The largest lender of the country said the loan growth of over 20 percent year-on-year lifted core interest income and also operating profit growth.

Analysts at HDFC Securities underlined that net interest margin (NIM) reflation was sharper than expected at 3.2 percent (a rise of 15 bps sequentially) and is expected to improve further in the near term, with full MCLR impact yet to play out.

The broker tweaked its FY23-24 estimates to factor in better NIMs and higher near-term loan growth. It retained the ‘buy’ tag with a target price of Rs 700, rating core bank at 1.3 times the September 24 adjusted book value.

On November 7, the stock traded up 4 percent to Rs 617.55.

Kajal Gandhi, an analyst at ICICIdirect, also set target price at Rs 700 for the counter, adding that SBI with its humongous size has reported consistently upbeat performance with this quarter seeing above par growth in earnings and return ratios.

“The stock, long due for re-rating, should see a strong positive reaction,” she said.

According to her, key triggers for future price performance is likely to be strong credit growth guidance of 14-16 percent, steady NIMs with adequate provision buffer, improving Return on Equity (RoE) trajectory and Continued traction in customer & business accretion via Yono. Any value unlocking in subsidiaries will further help the stock prices to appreciate.

A reduction in the SBI’s bad loan pile as well as a sharper loan growth has improved asset quality ratios in a big way for the quarter. On a net basis, bad loans were 0.80 percent of the loan book compared with 1.52 percent a year ago. This meant that the bank’s loan loss provisioning requirements have come down.

Ajit Kumar Kabi of LKP Securities, said he expects SBI to post a RoA and RoE of 0.9 percent and 15 percent by FY24 led by healthy balance sheet growth along with higher provision coverage ratio and stable asset quality.

Several other public sector bank stocks, too, were in huge demand on November 7. The Nifty PSU Bank index was up 5.65 percent, thanks to a rally in all constituent stocks led by Bank of Baroda that jumped over 11 percent.

""The stellar Q2 numbers from the PSU banking majors SBI and BoB reinforce the ongoing bullish story in banking,” said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. “Rising credit growth, improving asset quality and margins bode well for the banking sector and this has the potential to take the Bank Nifty and Nifty to new highs, driven by the bulls, who are in command now.”

State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, is targeting double-digit loan growth between 14-16 percent in the current financial year, Chairman Dinesh Khara said on November 5.

“This quarter was a busy season. That is why we had a strong credit growth. But I still expect, going by the current trend, we should have credit growth of 14-16 percent in the current financial year,” Khara said at a press briefing in Mumbai post the announcement of the bank's July-September results.

He elaborated that within corporate loans, SBI is seeing capex-related demand while capacity utilisation is showing signs of improvement. The country's largest lender is seeing demand from infrastructure, renewable power, oil and marketing companies and services sectors, he added.

SBI’s credit growth jumped nearly 20 percent year-on-year in the fiscal second quarter, with domestic advances growing 18.15 percent. The growth in domestic advances was driven by corporate advances followed by retail personal loans.

Indian banks are recovering from the COVID-19 crisis, which rendered many Indians jobless. Now that the economy is recovering, credit offtake has improved significantly. To fund this credit growth, banks are mobilising deposits at a faster pace amid tight banking system liquidity.

When asked about deposit growth for SBI, Khara said that much of it will be depend on how the industry grows.

“I can only say that we will not be seen lagging behind industry,” said Khara.

In terms of guidance on bad loans, the Chairman said that SBI’s endeavour will be to keep bad loan ratios “as low as possible” with divulging any number. The bank’s restructuring book currently stands at Rs 27,336 crore and is behaving “very well,” he said.

Further, the bank has 14 offers for bad loan accounts transferred to the National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL). Progress in loan accounts transferred to NARCL has been happening at a “rapid pace,” said Khara. He did not elaborate on the recovery expected from these accounts.

Q2 results:

Earlier on November 5, SBI reported a net profit of Rs 13,264 crore for the September quarter, a surge of 74 percent from a year earlier on improved asset quality and healthy loan growth.

The state-run lender’s profit beat street estimates by a mile. A Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerages had forecast net profit to be Rs 10,616.2 crore. While the sharp increase in quarterly profit comes from a healthy core interest income growth owing to a smart increase in credit expansion, there is a base effect at play also.

SBI's net interest income rose 12.83 percent to Rs 35,183 crore for the reported quarter, keeping with the improving trend of the previous two quarters. The bank’s interest earned rose 15 percent to Rs 79,859.59 crore while interest expended was Rs 44,676.15 crore, up from Rs 38,298 crore a year ago.

SBI’s gross non-performing assets were 3.52 percent of the total loan book, down from 4.90 percent a year ago. This is the lowest NPA ratio reported by the bank since FY12. The total gross bad loan pile reduced by 14 percent year-on-year and now stands at Rs 1.06 lakh crore."

In the September quarter of FY22, SBI had made exceptional provision of Rs 7,418 crore towards employee pension costs which had dented its profits then. Ergo, the net profit growth for September quarter in the current year shows a larger increase.

Nevertheless, loan growth of 20 percent year-on-year lifted core interest income and also operating profit growth. SBI reported a 16.8 percent increase in its operating profit for the September quarter. Sequentially, the increase in operating profit was a sharp 65.6 percent.

The largest Indian lender's net interest income rose 12.83 percent to Rs 35,183 crore for the reported quarter, keeping with the improving trend of the previous two quarters. The bank’s interest earned rose 15 percent to Rs 79,859.59 crore while interest expended was Rs 44,676.15 crore, up from Rs 38,298 crore a year ago.

Asset quality shines

SBI’s gross non-performing assets were 3.52 percent of the total loan book, down from 4.90 percent a year ago. This is the lowest NPA ratio reported by the bank since FY12. The total gross bad loan pile reduced by 14 percent year-on-year and now stands at Rs 1.06 lakh crore.

In essence, a reduction in bad loan pile as well as a sharper loan growth has improved asset quality ratios in a big way. On a net basis, bad loans were 0.80 percent of the loan book compared with 1.52 percent a year go. This meant that the bank’s loan loss provisioning requirements have come down. For the September quarter, SBI provided Rs 2,011 crore towards bad loans, which was 25 percent less than what it did a year ago. The bank’s slippage ratio and credit costs also declined sharply from year-ago levels. The slippage ratio fell to 0.33 percent for the reported quarter while its credit cost fell 15 basis points to 0.28 percent."

State Bank of India (SBI), India's biggest lender, is expected to report a robust 39 percent increase in net profit, driven by strong loan growth and improved asset quality, when it announces the numbers for the July-September quarter on November 5.

The quarter-on-quarter growth for most operating metrics is likely to show a big jump, given that State Bank of India reported benign numbers in Q1FY23.

An average of the estimates of eight brokerages polled by Moneycontrol puts SBI’s net profit for Q2FY23 at Rs 10,616.2 crore.

That said, analysts expect net interest income to be Rs 33,200 crore, a modest increase of 6 percent year on year. That, along with a likely fall in non-interest income (NII) could keep operating profit growth at 11 percent to Rs 20,085 crore for the reporting quarter.

SBI’s core interest income growth has been under pressure for many quarters now owing to legacy bad loans that do not contribute to interest income. The low-interest rate regime following the coronavirus outbreak has also been a drag on income.

Yet another factor for lower NII growth has been faster growth in retail loans than corporate loans. Corporate loan growth has recovered but it still is far from pre-pandemic levels. Loans to companies fetch higher interest rates than retail. As such, loan growth is expected to be robust for the September quarter.

Analysts expect SBI to report a healthy 16-18 percent loan growth for the quarter led by sustained retail loan growth and recovery in corporate loan disbursals.

“Healthy growth, margin recovery and lower staff cost in the absence of impact of family pension would drive up profitability,” analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd wrote in a note.

The bank’s loan book expanded 15 percent in the June quarter, led by an 18 percent jump in retail loans.

Asset quality improvement

Most analysts expect SBI to show steady bad loan ratios. Slippages are expected to be under control for the September quarter. This would mean provision requirements could continue to be low .

Analysts at Elara Capital, however, note that small business loans have been a pain point and could contribute to slippages. For the three months ended June, SBI had reported slippages of Rs 9,740 crore and gross bad loans had formed 3.91 percent of the total loan book.

Analysts expect gross bad loans to remain around these levels for the September quarter as well. Recoveries and upgrades will also be watched and the performance of the restructured portfolio of about Rs 30,000 crore would be keenly monitored.

Margin mantra

SBI’s cost of funds is one of the lowest in the industry owing to the bank’s unparalleled access to low-cost deposits. Its current and savings account deposits have a large share of 46 percent of total deposits. CASA growth, however, has been benign and the bank has hiked term deposit rates too.

Analysts expect the net interest margin to be stable above 3 percent for the bank given the deposit heft. But the yield on advances may disappoint and put pressure on margins.

Nevertheless, the outlook remains positive for margins and management commentary on the same would be closely watched. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services expect the margin to improve to 3.1 percent for the September quarter.

State Bank of India chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said the planned share sale of the bank's mutual fund subsidiary has been shelved for the time being.

SBI Mutual Fund, the country's largest asset manager with around Rs 6.5 lakh crore in asset under management, had in February selected seven merchant bankers for a USD 1-billion IPO. But soon the markets turned volatile with the Russian invasion of Ukraine later in that month.

""There is no plan to list SBI Mutual Fund for now,"" Khara told reporters on the sidelines of the national banking summit here. Without citing any reason, he said the IPO plan stands shelved for now.

On December 15, 2021, SBI had announced its plan to offload a 6 per cent stake in SBI MF through an IPO and was planning to raise around USD 1 billion.

SBI holds a 62.6 per cent stake in SBI Mutual Fund, while the remaining 36.8 per cent is with the leading French insurer Amundi Asset Management which was planning to offload 4 per cent of its holding.

Initially Amundi's holding was held by Societe Generale Asset Management, a subsidiary of Societe Generale of France which was transferred to Amundi in June 2011.

SBI had reportedly selected seven i-bankers -- BofA Securities, Citi, HSBC Securities, Axis Capital, Kotak Capital, SBI Caps and BNP Paribas -- for the share sale.

SBI has two other publicly traded subsidiaries -- SBI Life and SBI Card -- and has three more which can be monetised -- the mutual fund arm, general insurance vertical and the investment banking arm, SBI Caps.

SBI Life was listed in 2017. In a Rs 8,400-crore share sale, the IPO was oversubscribed 3.58 times. SBI Card was listed in March 2020 just before the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in a Rs 10,354-crore public issue.

If listed, SBI MF or SBI Funds Management, would have been the fifth listed fund manager after HDFC AMC, UTI Asset Management Company, Nippon Life India AMC and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC.

Meanwhile, the SBI chairman said credit demand, which has hit an eight-year high of 18 per cent last week, is coming in from across sectors, including SME corporates, retail and agriculture and that credit growth is a clear reflection that the economy is on a rebound.

""There is a healthy demand in the housing sector despite rising rates. Higher rates have not deterred demand,"" Khare said, adding, he expects credit growth to be moderate going forward but will remain healthy overall to about 15-16 per cent after festive pickup normalises.

On the digital rupee launch by the RBI on Tuesday, he said the CBDC pilot has gone well on the first day. He also said he doesn't think that bank deposits will be impacted with a full-scale launch of CBDC, which may happen over the next year.

He further said there is no concern on the restructured book as it is behaving better than expected. The NARCL or the national bad bank, is now quite active. ""We will see good traction on that front going forward,"" he said, adding, banks are exploring all possible options for resolution of bad loans including the NARCL route."
"October 31, 2022 08:49 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rate-war-to-mop-up-deposits-may-hurt-banks-margins-say-experts-9419661.html,"The aggressive drive for deposits in the backdrop of tight liquidity conditions may have an adverse effect on bank margins next fiscal year, say experts.

Banks have been aggressively accumulating deposits by offering higher, lucrative interest rates to depositors following four consecutive repo rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

The central bank is fighting a tough battle to contain persistently high retail inflation, which is hitting common households hard.

The impact of aggressive deposit mobilisation is likely to weigh on banks’ net interest margins (NIM) in the coming quarters, banking experts and analysts told Moneycontrol on October 31. In banking parlance, NIM refers to the amount of money that a bank earns in interest on loans compared to the amount it pays in interest on deposits. It is an indicator of a bank's profitability and growth.

“There are expectations of a rate hike in the next monetary policy, which will still allow banks to pass on the incremental cost to advances linked to the benchmark, and deposit rates will continue to rise with a lag, protecting the NIM for FY23,” said Aditya Acharekar, associate director at CareEdge.

“However, some impact on margins may be seen in the first half of FY24,” he added.

Rate transmission and NIM

Rate cues from the RBI are transmitted to the economy when lenders adjust their lending and deposit rates based on the RBI's rate actions. For instance, if the RBI hikes the repo rate, then banks will have to borrow short-term funds at a higher cost from the central bank. Banks are also expected to pass on the benefit to borrowers by offering high-interest rates.

Often, monetary transmission happens based on the prevailing liquidity situation. Typically, banks are quick to pass on rate hikes to consumers through loans, but a pass-through to deposits comes with a lag. For much of FY23, banks took advantage of this scenario, which helped them sustain or improve their NIM.

“We are prepared to take a hit on NIMs next fiscal year, but that is an obvious situation given that we have to fund the credit growth through deposits,” said a banker with a private bank on the condition of anonymity. “Mobilising deposits looks like the way forward.”

According to Arun Malhotra, founding partner and portfolio manager of CapGrow Capital Advisors, banks will have to forego NIMs as they could be compressed in the range of 20-25 bps in the short to medium term. Banks, according to Malhotra, may need to increase spreads on fresh repo-linked loans in the next two to four quarters.

In the July-September quarter, HDFC Bank’s core NIM was at 4.1 percent on total assets, and 4.3 percent based on interest-earning assets. Axis Bank’s NIM was at 3.96 percent, while Kotak Mahindra Bank’s NIM stood at 5.17 percent in the reporting quarter. Relatively smaller peers IndusInd Bank and IDBI Bank reported NIMs of 4.24 percent and 4.37 percent, respectively.

The rate picture

State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, recently made an upward revision in retail term deposit interest rates on amounts below Rs 2 crore, by up to 80 basis points. One bps equals one-hundredth of a percentage point. Indeed, most banks have increased their FD rates following the RBI’s 190 bps repo rate hike in the current cycle to rein in inflation.

According to bankers and experts, the ‘war’ for deposits is likely to continue as the RBI hikes rates further and as credit growth continues to expand. This could happen via aggressive deposit mobilisation in the coming months, said bankers. Analysts and economists expect the RBI to increase the repo rate to 6.50 percent by March from 5.90 percent currently.

Sumant Kathpalia, managing director and chief executive officer of IndusInd Bank, said that the lender would continue with its strategy to granularise deposits. The bank’s liabilities will be priced 50-to-75 bps higher than the market, he said at a conference call after the July-September earnings.

On average, banks have raised interest rates in the range of 25-80 bps across tenors. Fixed deposit rates of top banks in the three-year to five-year tenor for amounts below Rs 1 crore currently stand between 5.65 percent and 6.75 percent.

“It is natural for banks to be aggressive as liquidity remains constrained and credit growth is way ahead of deposit growth,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice-president, of research, at Kotak Securities. “Many banks have been aggressive already, and some have reached a point where a further increase in rates will cause a passthrough in borrower rates.”

Rush for deposits

The primary reason for the rush for deposits is the tightening liquidity in the banking system due to heavy currency leakage and heightened spending on account of the festive season. The RBI’s dollar sales in the foreign exchange market to prevent the rupee’s depreciation have also tightened liquidity.

The mismatch between credit growth and deposit growth has forced most banks to offer high rates on deposits and increase promotional activities for the same.

“If we look at the July-September banking results for FY23, one consistent finding is that advances are growing faster than deposits,” said Punit Patni, a research analyst at Swastika Investment.

“As a result, we anticipate banks raising their deposit rates in order to maintain CASA (current account savings account) deposits or raise money through term deposits. Additionally, due to the dearth of liquidity and good credit growth demand, all the banks are expected to be aggressive in mobilising deposits.”

This trend is likely to continue as credit growth continues to expand, interest rate hikes become more entrenched and liquidity in the system dries up further.

“We are expecting inflationary pressures to persist, and so rates may keep climbing till the end of this financial year,” said Adhil Shetty, chief executive officer at BankBazaar.com. “We may see small banks offer 8 percent or more (FD rates) during this period. If inflation persists, large banks will follow the trend.”

Analysts and industry experts said that the impact of the deposit rate hikes will also depend on the bank's liability and asset profile. Banks having granular, retail-based liability and floating advances are better placed and will witness a minimal impact on their NIMs, they said.

Jindal Haria, a director at India Ratings and Research, said that most banks would have to continue to increase deposit rates till they are confident deposit growth will mirror loan growth. NIMs, however, could expand some more before deposit pricing catches up fully, he said.

Fund-raising to continue

Apart from mobilising deposits, experts also expect banks to tap the market for funds to meet credit demand.

“Banks will have to raise funds from the capital markets through infra bonds, sub-debt and perpetual bonds quickly for long-term funding requirements to augment credit growth as CDs (certificates of deposit) and FDs may not match their long-term funding requirements,” said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner at Rockfort Fincap, a Mumbai-based debt advisory firm.

The pure-play credit card company promoted by the country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) said the jump in net profit came on the back of higher income. The total income in the second quarter of the current fiscal rose 28 percent to Rs 3,453 crore from Rs 2,695 crore a year ago, it said in a regulatory filing.

There was improvement in the company's asset quality with net NPAs (bad loans) declining to 0.78 percent from 0.91 percent.

However, margins fell 90 basis points on-quarter to 12.3 percent in Q2 on the back of a decline in the revolver mix and higher cost of funds, noted domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Revolver mix stood at 24 percent as against 26 percent in Q1FY23. Revolver is the term used for card holders who roll over part of the bill to the next month, instead of paying off the balance in full. It is estimated that seven out of ten card holders revolve the debt and are thereby called ""good or smart revolvers"".

Total operating cost increased by 33 percent at Rs 1,834 crore from Rs 1,383 crore in Q2FY22.

Global brokerage Morgan Stanley has an Overweight call on the stock with target price of Rs 1100. “Revolver mix and higher funding costs could weigh on net interest margin. We trim forecasts for FY23-25 by 1-2 percent” it said.

Meanwhile, CLSA has a Sell call on the stock with a target price of Rs 795 per share. The firm has cut estimates by 3-5 percent.

With an Outperform call on the stock, Credit Suisse has cut its target to Rs 1,080 from Rs 1,150. Analysts at Credit Suisse have cut FY23-35 earnings per share estimate by 4 percent on back of higher operating expense and lower NIMs.

Capex upcycle and strong provision coverage ratios have been the reasons behind his optimism on PSU banks.

The rally in Nifty PSU Bank index has been a testament to his optimism. The index has gained 28 percent in 2022 so far with share price of SBI, Canara Bank, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda having advanced 20-70 percent.

But a pause in the government’s disinvestment pipeline, according to Kela, might spoil the party for the PSU pack as a whole. Speaking at the Moneycontrol Muhurat Roundtable, the market veteran said, “I don’t think a lot will get disinvested in the next 18 months. I'm not particularly very excited on that front.”

“2024 is an election year. Till then, only a few pending cases may get resolved. But post 2024, if PM Modi comes back with a stable BJP government, only then you will see a real big drive towards disinvestment,” he added.

Currently on the disinvestment front, the central government has invited bids for the sale of 60.72 percent stake in IDBI Bank. LIC and the government hold 49.24 percent and 45.48 percent in the bank respectively. Roadshows for CONCOR disinvestment have been kicked off while oil refiner BPCL’s disinvestment has been put on hold for now.

Meanwhile, veteran fund manager Prashant Jain believes the best is yet to come in PSU stocks. Some of the PSU stocks, especially from the defence space like Bharat Dynamics and Hindustan Aeronautics, have doubled investors’ wealth in last one year.

“There are both good and bad PSUs. If you focus on good companies and good valuations, eventually returns will come. PSU stocks in the banking space, mining space, power and defence sectors have done extremely well. And, I think there is still some value left in the banking and energy space,” he said. During his tenure at HDFC AMC, Jain had taken ‘contrarian’ bets on Coal India, NTPC, Power Grid Corporation and SBI."

They have cut home loan rates recently to attract demand in wake of the festive season.

As part of its festive offer, SBI is offering a concession of up to 0.25 percent on home loans, with rates starting at 8.40 percent.

The country’s largest lender is also offering a concession of 0.15 percent on top-up loans, and 0.30 percent on loans against property. The bank has further sweetened the deal by waiving off the processing fee on home loans up to January 2023.

Bank of Maharashtra also cut its home loan interest rates by 30-70 basis points. Home loans will now be available at a minimum of 8 percent per annum rate.

Mortgage lender HDFC also offers festive cheer for borrowers. Under the special festive offer, HDFC is offering just one rate of 8.4 percent on home loans for a credit score of 750 and above, irrespective of the loan amount. This offer is valid till November 30. Prior to this offer, HDFC’s home loan rates ranged between 8.60 and 9 percent, depending on the loan amount and credit score.

Festivals such as Navratri, Dussehra, Dhanteras and Diwali are traditionally considered auspicious to make investments in homes, gold, etc. Lenders are using the festive season to offer lucrative home loan rates and tap into credit demand.

Tapping demand

The drop in rates comes at a time when the RBI’s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has increased the repo rate by 190 basis points since May to quell inflationary pressures in the economy. Banks are quick to pass the repo rate hike on loans to consumers.

Bankers said that the cut in home loan rates comes at the right time, now that the economy is just about recovering from COVID-19 and the festive cheer has begun to set in.

“As we enter the festive season after a long period of muted celebrations due to COVID restrictions, our offers this festive season are aimed at providing the much-needed support to prospective home buyers as they embark on their journey for home ownership,” said Alok Kumar Choudhary, managing director, retail banking and operations at SBI.

Choudhary added that SBI is seeing “strong interest” for home loans across the country.

Home loans extended by banks increased by 16.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 17.86 lakh crore in August, according to data from the central bank. Analysts attributed this rise to pent-up demand, consumers’ growing disposable incomes and aspiration for owning a house.

“Lower interest rates do lure borrowers. We would like to see the length of time the scheme works to see if the demand will accrue,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice president, research, at Kotak Securities.

Can home loan demand sustain?

According to analysts, demand for loans responds more to every consumer’s affordability rather than cost of money. Also, to say that home loan demand will sustain just on the basis of these cuts would be premature, especially since interest rates are poised to edge higher, going forward, they said. Whether other banks shall follow suit is a strategic decision of each bank, they added.

“In an increasing interest-rate environment, lenders will not offer such generous pricing to everyone. So, the eligibility filters will be fairly tight, I suspect,” said Krishnan ASV, senior vice president, HDFC Securities.

“Any positive impact on demand would be negligible. This demand would come from those consumers who have waited on the sidelines for the right offer. Now, when pricing is conducive, such customers may bite,” Krishnan added.

According to Punit Patni, a research analyst at Swastika Investmart, the robust demand for home ownership is “astonishing”, considering the current interest hikes and rising real estate prices. Lower rates may not be sustainable (for lenders) for a long time, which is why these offers are meant for only a temporary period, added Patni.

Patni said that the recently announced rate cuts by a few lenders “will be the icing on the cake” for borrowers and other banks will jump on the bandwagon soon."

Fund raising through corporate bond sales rose sharply by 49% month-on-month to Rs 82,378 crore on the back of large issuance by some banks and state-owned entities even as the rates on these instrument rise, dealers said.

This was because most issuers have raised funds before yields started to move up, said Umesh Kumar Tulsyan, managing director of Sovereign Global Markets, a New Delhi-based fund house.

Corporate bonds are debt securities issued by private and public corporations. Companies issue corporate bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes, whether building a new plant, purchasing equipment, or growing their business. When one buys a corporate bond, one effectively lends money to the ""issuer,"" the company that issued the bond.

According to data from Prime Database, companies and banks raised funds worth Rs 82,378 crore in September, compared to Rs 55,500 crore raised in the previous month. Data also showed that funds raised in September was the highest in the current financial year.

State Bank of India, Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd, Power Finance Corp., Small Industries Development Bank of India, and HDFC Bank were among the top five issuers in September, together raising Rs 31,708 crore. The money raised by these five entities amounted to 39% of the total funds raised in September.

""The view of the market was that the yield will be moving up and all wanted to fulfil their capital requirement, so somehow they timed the best of the market to raise funds,"" Tulsyan added.

""Issuance has risen in September because bond yields were supported due to expectation of global bond index inclusion, positive FPI (foreign portfolio investment) flows, lower SDL (State Development loans) supply and strong investors demand which reflected in primary issuance bidding. Also credit off-take has been positive, clocking around 16% Y-o-Y growth and with the festive season approaching we may see a significant rise in demand for money,"" said Sanjay Pawar, Fund Manager – Fixed Income, LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Ltd.

Yield movement

Yield on corporate bonds maturing in three years rose by 45 basis points, five years by 40 basis points and 10-year by 22 basis points month-on-month in September, tracking an uptick in government securities yield and low demand from mutual funds. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Pawar added that the market had seen a hardening of yields across the segment both in government securities and corporate bonds due to a delay in the inclusion of the country's bonds in its global index, the central bank hiking rates aggressively, a rally in crude prices, weakening rupee and draining out of liquidity from system.

Further, the yield on benchmark government bonds has risen by 25 basis points, whereas due to the quarter-end there was redemption pressure on mutual funds that led to a rise in yields on corporate bonds.

According to data compiled from the corporate bond deals, the yield on three-years corporate bonds that were trading at a 7.10% rose to 7.55% in September, yield on five-years paper rose to 7.65% from 7.20%, and the yield 10-year paper rose to 7.72% from 7.50%.

Going forward

Debt dealers said yields are expected to rise further due to heavy supply in the second half of the current financial year and expectations of further rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

While issuers will keenly watch the movement of the yield on government securities, which were expected to rise further given higher crude oil prices.

Usually, higher Brent crude oil prices put pressure on the inflation print, leading to a dampening of investor sentiments . In the last few days, Brent crude oil prices had risen sharply after OPEC and its allies decided to cut production output by 2 million barrels per day. Brent crude oil prices were trading at $97.38.

Moreover, the spread between corporate bonds and government securities, which is hovering at a historical low, is expected to rise as supply may increases and if liquidity conditions tighten further, Pawar said."

Deutsche Bank's m-cap is at $15 billion. Last year its m-cap was at $26 billion. Both Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have declined nearly 58 percent and 40 percent in the last one year.

Many Indian banks like State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Indusind Bank now have higher market capitalisation than Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank.

Banking analysts and industry experts said the trend is likely to continue even in the upcoming quarters, despite worsening global macro headwinds and the central bank’s tightening monetary policy regime.

“Over the medium term, a well-capitalised balance sheet, improving loan growth and lower credit cost forecast are positive catalysts that should allow valuation multiples to improve as macro stability returns,” said Nilanjan Karfa, an analyst at brokerage house Nomura.

In this context, three narratives—banks’ current account savings account (CASA)-dominant compounding franchises, earnings geared to growth, and lower credit cost—will likely play out, said Karfa.

Numbers game

Banks’ July-September business updates paint a rosy picture for the sector. Top banks, including State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank, have reported a double-digit increase in loan growth for the July-September quarter on a year-on-year basis. Deposit growth has also been strong.

HDFC Bank, for instance, reported a 23.5 percent increase in loans and advances year on year in the July-September quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, loan growth increased by just over 6 percent. The deposit base grew 19.5 percent on-year.

IndusInd Bank, too, said its advances rose 17.6 percent and 4.7 percent on a yearly and quarterly basis, respectively. Deposits grew at 13.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.

State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, said its advances stood at Rs 67,981 crore in the fiscal second quarter, up 16.6 percent on a year-on-year basis and just over 5 percent on a quarterly basis. Deposits were at Rs 88,503 crore, up 1.9 percent year on year.

Relatively smaller peers Federal Bank, Bank of Maharashtra and Karur Vysya Bank reported a similar trend as seen in the chart below.

Not just banks, mortgage lender HDFC was also party to the trend. HDFC’s assigned loans stood at Rs 9,145 crore in the July-September quarter, up 28.2 percent on a year-on-year basis. Individual loans sold were at Rs 34,513 crore, up about 27 percent on a year-on-year basis.

What’s driving loan growth?

Indian banks are recovering from the COVID-19 crisis, which rendered many Indians jobless. Now that the economy is recovering, credit offtake has improved significantly. According to RBI data, bank credit registered a yearly growth of 16 percent in August. Also, the July-September quarter numbers come on the back of a low base.

Now that the festive season is around the corner, analysts expect banks to capitalise on higher spending and report healthy credit growth in the upcoming quarters as well.

“We expect strong (credit) growth for banks. System credit is at 16 percent, this is likely to translate into strong growth for banks,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice president–research, at Kotak Securities. “There has been better credit utilisation driven by MSMEs, strong personal loan growth, credit cards and housing.”

“We expect festive season credit growth to be healthy, too. We expect healthy credit growth trends for the year,” added Dhame.

According to Punit Patni, an analyst at Swastika Investmart, a rise in spending, the opening up of the economy as the coronavirus pandemic eases, strong housing and real estate demand, government spending, the thrust on infrastructure, and high capacity utilisation levels are some of the reasons that explain the improved credit growth.

“Following the normalisation of COVID effects, the banking sector is experiencing positive growth momentum, which is expected to last for the next few quarters,” added Patni. “The impending festival season will be the icing on the cake as retail spending and credit demand remain strong.”

Credit demand is expected to stay robust despite four successive rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said analysts. The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has increased rates by 190 basis points since May to quell inflationary pressure . Rate cues from the RBI are transmitted in the banking system when lenders adjust their lending and deposit rates.

Moneycontrol reported on October 3 that even though lending rates are edging higher, bankers and analysts do not expect the rate hike cycle to curb demand for loans.

Deposit mobilisation to continue

To fund the credit growth, analysts expect banks to mobilise deposits, especially in the wake of banking surplus liquidity tightening at a faster pace.

Already, lenders such as Axis Bank, DCB Bank, ICICI Bank and RBL Bank have increased fixed deposit (FD) rates following the RBI rate hike. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, in his post-policy briefing, said there would be more traction with regard to the adjustment of deposit rates, going forward.

“We expect a rate war sort of situation to mobilise deposits, especially in the mid- and small-sized banking segment,” said Swastika Investmart’s Patni. “However, banks with high CASA share, high liquidity coverage, and low credit-to-deposit ratios are better positioned to navigate the upcoming liquidity dearth.”

Kotak Securities’ Dhame concurred with Patni. “Deposit mobilisation is likely to be the way forward,” she said. Banks have raised deposit rates since the rate hike cycle has begun but not commensurate with the hikes in repo. We believe there is more scope for deposit rate hikes and mobilisation thereof.”"

Technical View | Nifty defends 17,000, relief rally likely as index looks oversold

The index has seen the formation of a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts. The 50-share benchmark index has defended the 17,000 mark due to a bit of recovery in late trade, hence if the index manages to sustain the same crucial mark then there could be a temporary relief rally in the market after being looked oversold, but if the index fails to hold on to the said level then there could be a fair chance of index breaking 16,900-16,800 levels in coming days, experts feel.

State Bank of India-led lenders have agreed to withdraw the petition against Oil Country Tubular (OCTL), India’s lone manufacturer of import substitute range of products for oil and gas drilling operations, more than two-and-a-half years after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) ordered the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) proceedings.

This provides a major relief to the promoters of the Rs 5,000-crore Kamineni group with interests in manufacturing, healthcare and medical education as they gain back management control over the company that was being managed by the Tribunal-appointed insolvency resolution professional for over two years.

The OCTL managing director Sashidhar Kamineni told Moneycontrol that the promoters have successfully struck a compromise deal of one-time settlement (OTS) with all the lenders who have now agreed to withdraw the CIRP proceedings against the company.

Following this, the Hyderabad bench of the NCLT on September 21 ordered the withdrawal of CIRP proceedings against Oil Country, while relieving the insolvency resolution professional from his duties.

The resolution professional took control and custody of the management and operations of Oil Country on January 28, 2020, the day the NCLT had ordered initiating CIRP proceedings at the company after admitting the petition filed by the financial creditors led by SBI.

The Tribunal in its September 21 directives recalling the CIRP proceedings has noted that the corporate debtor (OCTL) has settled the dues of the financial creditors under OTS following which the creditors passed a resolution with 100 percent voting to withdraw the CIRP proceedings. “Hence, the Corporate Debtor (OCTL) is at liberty to function through the Directors as per law.”

Though Indian Bank and Indian Overseas Bank have been in favour of the OTS proposal and withdrew the CIRP proceedings against OCTL, it was SBI that changed its stand after initially accepting the proposal in the joint lenders’ meeting.

As the compromise proposal has to be effectuated within 90 days from the date of commencement of the CIRP process, Oil Country had instituted the payment of the accepted OTS and even paid Rs 60.54 crore out of Rs 70 crore. However, SBI, though agreed to OTS initially, refused to accept the amounts and extend the time for balance payments.

Earlier on July 15, Justice B Vijaysen Reddy of the Telangana High Court ordered setting aside the decision of the SBI where the lender refused to accept the previously approved OTS proposal and to extend the time for payments. The court directed the lenders to look afresh into the OTS proposal approved earlier for payment of amounts beyond the stipulated time along with interest.

The Telangana High Court also found the stand of SBI as lacking transparency and clarity and the bank’s action in refusing to accept the OTS as “arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.”

Following this, the Committee of Creditors (CoC) at their meeting held on September 17 approved with 100 percent voting to accept the OTS proposal and conveyed to the NCLT their decision to withdraw the CIRP proceedings against Oil Country Tubular."

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested Rishi Agarwal, the founder-chairman of ABG Shipyard Group, in an alleged bank fraud case amounting to over Rs 22,800 crore, CNBC TV-18 reported on September 21.

Agarwal, along with ABG Shipyard and others, was booked by the central agency in February this year for allegedly cheating a consortium of banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) of over Rs 22,842 crore.

Besides Agarwal, the agency had also named ABG Shipyard's then executive director Santhanam Muthaswamy, directors Ashwini Kumar, Sushil Kumar Agarwal and Ravi Vimal Nevetia and another company ABG International Pvt Ltd for alleged offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust and abuse of official position under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Prevention of Corruption Act.

This is reported to be the biggest bank fraud case registered by the CBI.

Notably, the SBI had first filed a complaint on November 8, 2019, on which the CBI had sought some clarifications on March 12, 2020. The bank filed a fresh complaint in August that year. After scrutinising, the CBI acted on the complaint and filed an FIR on February 7, 2022.

The company was sanctioned credit facilities from 28 banks and financial institutions with the SBI having exposure of Rs 2,468.51 crore, the agency officials had told news agency PTI.

The Forensic Audit has shown that between 2012-17, the accused colluded together and committed illegal activities including diversion of funds, misappropriation and criminal breach of trust, the officials had reportedly said.

The loan account was declared a non-performing asset (NPA) in July 2016 and a fraud in 2019.

The alleged delay in the registration of FIR by the CBI had drawn criticism from the Opposition. The Congress, the country's prime Opposition party, had questioned the Centre in February on why it took five years after the liquidation proceedings of ABG Shipyard to lodge a case in connection with the alleged duping of 28 banks.

""Why did the Modi government refuse to take note of the allegations made on February 15, 2018 by the Congress, warning of a scam in ABG Shipyard, and why no FIR was lodged and criminal action taken despite their accounts having been declared as fraud on June 19, 2019?"" the party had asked.

The Enforcement Directorate, another federal probing agency, initiated an investigation into alleged money laundering after after studying the CBI FIR against the former promoters of the ship building company. The ED case was also registered in February.

India’s banking sector is witnessing the fastest pace of credit growth in nearly a decade, and business correspondents (BCs) are a part of the core process of credit delivery to remote and unbanked areas.

Moneycontrol on September 16 reported first that the BC partner of country’s largest lender SBI, Save Solutions, is eyeing an initial public offering (IPO) in FY25.

Through this explainer, Moneycontrol will walk you through BCs - what are they and why they are critical to India’s banking infrastructure:

Who are BCs?

To put it simply, BCs are agents who connect banks with customers.

BC touch points allow bank customers to undertake critical banking transactions including withdrawal of cash and money transfer, among others.

Why are they important?

As per the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) FY22 annual report, the total number of business correspondents in villages has increased from more than 11.9 lakh in 2020 to 18.44 lakh in 2021, reflecting the penetration and scale that banks generate partnering with BCs.

Urban locations covered by banks through the BC channels also rose to 14.12 lakh in 2021 from 3.24 lakh in 2020, as per RBI data. The sharp increase was on account of higher amount of data provided by “a few” private banks, the RBI said.

The total number of bank BCs in villages during 2010 stood at 34,174, while banks in urban areas reported having 447 BCs during the same period. The data highlights how significantly banks have been using the BC network to reach masses.

Who are the top players?

As per the Indian Banks’ Association website, there are 285 corporate BCs in India including Fino Payments Bank, Save Solutions, Airtel Payments Bank, among others.

Individually, SBI has the highest number of BC partners, at 71,968 across country.

What is the business model?

In exchange for providing banks’ various services to its customers, BCs charge a pre-determined minimum fee per transaction to the bank.

Will BC model and infrastructure keep pace with digital adoption?

As per Save Solutions MD Ajeet Kumar Singh, digitisation does not pose any threat to the BC model.

“Even though digital transactions are increasing, digital platforms have more presence and are used more in urban areas but 95 percent CSPs (customer service points) are in rural areas,” Singh said.

“The rural area users are not very friendly with digital payment methods. They all are more into cash payments and transactions,” he added."
"September 16, 2022 05:53 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/exclusive-sbis-largest-bc-partner-save-solutions-eyes-ipo-in-fy25-9188641.html,"SAVE Solutions, the largest business correspondent (BC) partner of State Bank of India (SBI), plans to go public in fiscal 2025, its top official said.

“We are planning to launch an IPO (initial public offering) in the 2024-25 financial year which will totally depend on the situation of the market sentiments,” the company’s managing director and chief executive officer (MD & CEO) Ajeet Kumar Singh told Moneycontrol on Friday, September 16.

Business correspondents act as a last-mile touchpoint for banks that are unable to set up branches in remote areas. These touchpoints allow bank customers to undertake various banking transactions including withdrawal of cash and money transfer.

In exchange for providing banks’ services to its customers, BCs charge a predetermined minimum fee per transaction to the respective lender.

SAVE solutions, based out of Gaya, Bihar, started operations in 2009. In FY21, SAVE Solutions’ BC business clocked in a total transaction value of Rs 41,000 crore, Singh said. According to him, for SBI, SAVE Solutions undertakes about 500,000-600,000 transactions per day amounting to nearly Rs 200 crore.

Per the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) website, there are a total of 285 registered corporate BCs in India.

Further, the firm also plans to go for another round of equity capital raising from institutional investors, Singh said.

“We are also planning to raise the third round of equity and we have already started the process. Microfinance portfolios will definitely grow very fast… Other portfolios will also grow as per the business plans. So this is a good trend,” Singh added.

As per Singh, SAVE Solutions works with banks including SBI, Bank of India (BOI), Bank of Baroda (BoB) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) as their BC partner, and serves about 4 lakh customers on a daily basis.

“We are the largest business correspondent of the State Bank of India having 9,000 CSPs (customer service points), and are present pan-India. We have a presence of like 1,200 CSPs for BOI. We have 500 CSPs for BoB. We have just started with PNB six months back, so have 300 CSPs for them and are also working with the two RRBs (regional rural banks),” Singh said.

According to Singh, state-run banks now want to use the BC network in not just banking transactions but also to source loans.

“BCs have a wide scope because banks nowadays are looking at BCs in a different way. Banks like SBI have tied up with us for loan sourcing, loan collections, from agriculture to sales and agriproducts and loan products through our CSP network,” Singh said.

When asked whether digitisation of banking services poses a threat to the BC model, Singh said that even though online transactions are increasing, digital platforms have a higher presence and are more widely used in urban areas but 95 percent CSPs are in rural areas.

“The rural area users are not very friendly with digital payment methods. They all are more into cash payments and transactions,” he said.

Singh said that SAVE Solutions was open to acquiring broking agencies and other non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).

“We are looking for both organic and inorganic growth with a primary focus on organic growth. We are open to acquiring broking agencies and other NBFCs, but it totally depends on valuation,” he said.

As of the end of June, SAVE Solutions had a network of over 12,000 CSPs covering 21 million rural customers in 28 states and 3 Union territories, according to a company presentation.

“The IPO will likely see participation based on factors including management, valuation, floor price and scope of expansion, among others. It totally boils down to what is going to be valuation and floor price,” said Gaurang Shah, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services."

The country's largest public sector lender, State Bank of India (SBI), on September 15 clarified that it has not been identified as the nodal bank for handling Russia-related transactions after news reports suggested so.

Mentioning the July-dated Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular on forming additional arrangement for invoicing, payment, and settlement of exports and imports in rupees amid the Russia-Ukraine war situation, SBI noted that the central bank has authorised all the banks in India, including the SBI, to open Special Rupee Vostro account to promote invoicing in Indian rupee.

""Accordingly, SBI is making necessary arrangements and processing requests received from various banks, including Russian banks, duly following RBI guidelines and our policies and procedures. SBI, as such, has not been identified as a nodal bank,"" it clarified.

On July 11, the RBI had announced a mechanism to settle payments for international trade in rupees, especially for India's exports.

The decision, the RBI mentioned, had come in order to promote growth of global trade with emphasis on exports from India and to support the increasing interest of global trading community in Indian rupees. ""Before putting in place this mechanism, authorised dealer (AD) banks shall require prior approval from the Foreign Exchange Department of Reserve Bank of India,"" the central bank added.

It also mentioned that the exchange rate between the currencies of the two trading partner countries may be market-determined.

Meanwhile, the Indian rupee weakened sharply against a rampant US dollar, driven by a broad-based selloff in global markets. PTI reported that the rupee fell 41 paise to 79.58 against the US dollar in early trade."

The country's largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), raised the Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR) by 70 basis points (or 0.7 per cent) to 13.45 per cent.

The announcement would make loan repayment linked to BPLR costlier. The current BPLR rate is 12.75 per cent. It was revised last in June.

""Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR) revised as 13.45 per cent per annum with effect from September 15, 2022,"" the SBI posted on its website. The bank has also raised the base rate by similar basis points to 8.7 per cent, effective Thursday.

The EMI amount for the borrowers who have taken loans at the base rate would go up. These are the old benchmarks on which banks used to disburse loans. Now most of the banks provide loans on the External Benchmark Based Lending Rate (EBLR) or the Repo-Linked Lending Rate (RLLR).

The bank revises both the BPLR and the base rate on a quarterly basis. The lending rate revision by the SBI is likely to be followed by other banks in the days to come. The increase in the benchmark lending rates comes weeks ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy meeting, which is again expected to hike rates to tame inflation.

According to the schedule, the next three-day monetary policy meeting will be held from September 28 to September 30."

The RBI in July issued a detailed circular asking banks to put in place additional arrangements for export and import transactions in Indian rupees in view of increasing interest of the global trading community in the domestic currency.

Currently, a large part of bilateral trade between India and Russia is getting settled in rupee due to sanctions imposed by the US and Europe following Moscow's attack on Ukraine. The RBI had said for settlement of trade transactions, the concerned banks will require special rupee vostro accounts of correspondent bank/s of the partner trading country.

Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) president A Sakthivel said that the SBI (State Bank of India) is equipped with doing business in rupee with Russia, but Moscow has to identify one bank. ""Yesterday commerce secretary (B V R Subrahmanyam) was there with us in the evening. He said that very soon Russian government is going to identify a bank...Rupee trade with Russia will happen,"" Sakthivel told reporters here.

He said that Russia is expected to announce the name of the bank in 15 days. ""So the SBI is already identified here...We have a good rupee payment mechanism in Iran, so same thing will happen (with Russia)...SBI is a huge bank to cater the need of exporters,"" he added.

FIEO has demanded from the government that rupee trade should be entitled for benefits currently available for trade in major currencies. Once the mechanism comes into play, ""we do not want to bother about the foreign currency fluctuations. Indian rupee will speak for itself ...I think very soon it will happen,"" Sakthivel said.

On September 7, Reserve Bank and the finance ministry asked top management of banks and representatives of trade bodies to push exports and import transactions in rupee. According to sources, it was stressed during a meeting that banks should connect with their foreign counterparts for opening special rupee vastro accounts to facilitate cross-border trade in Indian currency rather than popular mode dollar.

They had stated that countries like Sri Lanka, Argentina and Zimbabwe may be interested in settling bilateral trade in rupee. The announcement by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow cross-border trade transactions in rupee is a timely move and a step towards internationalisation of the currency.

In 2021-22, India's exports to Russia stood at USD 3.25 billion, while imports aggregated at about USD 10 billion."

Shares of State Bank of India on Wednesday became the third lender and seventh Indian company to cross the Rs 5-trillion market cap for the first time after its shares rallied over 22 percent so far this year.

The stock hit a record high of Rs 564.85 on the BSE, up 1.3 percent from its previous close. The stock stayed in the green through five straight sessions and gained 6 percent in this period.

HDFC Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd achieved this milestone earlier. Among other Indian companies, Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Hindustan Unilever, Life Insurance Corp of India and HDFC are in the league.

SBI now ranks seventh most valued Indian company. Reliance Industries remains India's most-valued company, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, HDFC Bank, Infosys, ICICI Bank and Hindustan Unilever.

Since the last few sessions, banking stocks traded higher amid RBI data showing demand for credit in good growth. Bank Nifty rose for the fifth session, gaining 2 percent in this period. Since the start of September, ICICI Bank gained 5 percent, HDFC Bank 3 percent and Axis Bank 7.5 percent.

The RBI data for the week ended August 26 showed the credit growth of Indian banks was at a nine-year high of 15.5 percent on-year. Outstanding credit in the banking system stood at Rs 124.30 trillion at the end of August 26 with banks having lent close to Rs 6 trillion between April and August.

Analysts expect that SBI is a key beneficiary of the systemic uptick in credit demand, especially led by corporate credit growth witnessed so far this year.

""With increasing signs of momentum continuing in corporate demand and a potential capex upturn in FY24, we believe that SBI is one of the best-placed participants in the sector. Though the share of retail loans has gone up over the last few years (36 percent of loans in 1Q23 as against 31 percent in FY20), we see a gradual increase in the corporate credit share incrementally,"" said JM Financial in a recent note to investors.

The lender reported unimpressive earnings in the June quarter with many brokerages have either maintained or cut their earnings forecast for FY23 and FY24, citing a miss on the net interest margin (NIM), lowest net interest income (NII) growth in Q1 among top five banks, and likely capital requirement in the medium term.

""(Margins) in our view should normalise going ahead with the bank’s liability franchise being among the best in the sector. While the bank may need to raise equity capital over the next 12-24 months (CET1), stake sale in subsidiaries (SBI Funds, SBI General Insurance) remains another option to augment capital and may delay the eventual dilution,"" the JM Financial report said.

According to Bloomberg, SBI has 48 'buy' and two 'hold' ratings. No analysts have a 'sell' rating on the stock.

State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender by assets, is targeting a loan growth of at least 15 percent in this financial year, chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara told CNBC-TV18 on September 9.

“At least for the current (financial year) I can say with some bit of certainty (that) the way things are, I am hoping that we should be in a position to record at least 15 percent growth in the loan book,” Khara told the television channel.

The bank’s current retail loan growth was “quite sustainable.” More so, loan growth was uniform across retail segments such as personal loans, and auto loans, he said.

On the corporate side, too, SBI’s sanctioned project loans stood at Rs 1.5 lakh crore to Rs 1.7 lakh crore, he said. About 70 to 75 percent of these projects were from the private sector.

The bank was seeing good traction from renewable energy and electric vehicle segments, the chairman added.

SBI’s loan growth stood at 14.9 percent in April-June, up from 11 percent in the previous quarter and 5.8 percent in the same quarter of the last financial year.

Most banks are aiming for a higher credit growth this fiscal as the economy picks up pace and credit growth expands.

Guidance

Khara said on September 9 that the state-run lender was targeting credit costs to be less than 100 basis points in FY23. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

As far as net interest margins are concerned, SBI expects a range of 3.15 percent and 3.20 percent to hold. SBI’s NIMs stood at 3.23 percent in the April-June quarter.

The bank had raised Rs 6,800 crore through additional tier 1 bonds, Khara said. It would raise additional funds via tier 2 bonds.

The state-run lender expected 100 bad loan resolutions to happen through the bankruptcy court or the National Company Law Tribunal, the chairman said. So far in FY23, there have been 80 liquidations, he added.

On August 6, SBI reported a net profit of Rs 6,068 crore for the June quarter, missing the Street estimates by a wide margin as treasury losses eroded profitability. Beyond the treasury hit, SBI’s core performance was resilient.

Net interest income, the difference between the interest income the bank earns from its lending activities and the interest paid to depositors, grew by a healthy 12.87 percent to Rs 31,196 crore for the quarter on the back of a robust 14.9 percent loan growth and stable margins.

Provisions toward bad loans declined, as asset quality improved. Provisions declined 15 percent to Rs 4,268 crore for the three months ended June 30, aiding net profit growth.

SBI’s gross bad loans ratio improved from the year-ago period and its already strong provision cushion strengthened further.

The total pile of gross bad loans declined 15 percent from a year ago to Rs 1.13 lakh crore as of June end. Gross bad loans formed 3.91 percent of the loan book as against 5.32 percent in the same quarter of the previous financial year."

Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank said on August 30 that it wrote twice to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) requesting enforcement of standardised fraud reporting requirements by all lenders.

This came after a media report, citing government data, said Kotak recorded 5,278 cases of fraud in the first quarter (April to June) of FY22, whereas State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, reported only nine cases.

Moneycontrol spoke to bankers and experts on whether all banks follow set protocols in reporting frauds and the challenges and reforms needed to plug loopholes:

1. What type of frauds do banks report to the regulator?

Lenders must report frauds of Rs 1 lakh and above pertaining to fund misappropriation, criminal breach of trust, encashment through forged instruments, manipulation of books of accounts or through fictitious accounts, and conversion of property, said Jugal Mantri, chief executive officer at Anand Rathi Global Finance, citing RBI guidelines.

Banks must also report frauds related to unauthorised credit facilities extended for reward or for illegal gratification, negligence and cash shortages, cheating and forgery, and irregularities in foreign exchange transactions, among others.

Kotak Mahindra said of the 5,278 cases it reported, 97 percent were associated with digital and card-related frauds that occurred “due to customers unwittingly compromising their credentials by clicking on unknown links” or giving access to their devices, among others.

“It is our submission that other banks do not appear to be exhaustively or uniformly reporting these types of frauds. Such frauds are not a reflection of any vulnerabilities in the bank’s secure infrastructure and systems,” the bank said.

2. How many frauds did banks report in FY22?

Responding to Moneycontrol’s query, an SBI spokesperson said the bank reported 4,192 frauds in FY22 and 5,724 frauds in FY21 to the regulator.

Data provided by the RBI shows that while private lenders reported more frauds than public sector banks in FY22, the total value of frauds reported by PSU banks was substantially higher than that of private banks.

As per the RBI data, private lenders reported 5,334 fraud cases amounting to over Rs 1 lakh during FY22, higher than 3,078 cases reported by the state-run lenders. The total amount involved in frauds reported by private banks stood at Rs 17,588 crore during FY22, lower than Rs 40,282 crore of frauds reported by state-owned lenders.

Further, according to the latest data provided by the Centre, during Q1FY23 while some lenders did not report any fraud, HDFC Bank reported 303 fraud cases while ICICI Bank reported 436 cases. The two banks did not offer comment for this story.

3. Which are the areas where banks report the most frauds?

According to the SBI spokesperson, the most instances of fraud by volume is in the retail segment, and by value, it is in the corporate segment.

Deloitte India, citing a survey, identified retail banking as a major contributor to fraud incidents, with 53 percent of the respondents indicating they had experienced more than 100 fraud incidents over the past two years, reflecting a 29 percent increase since the previous edition.

“Similarly, the non-retail segment saw an average of 20 fraud incidents, highlighted by 56 percent of the survey respondents, again a rise from the previous edition that stood at 22 percent,” said KV Karthik, partner, financial advisory, at Deloitte India.

Additionally, data theft, cybercrime, third-party induced fraud, bribery and corruption, and fraudulent documentation were identified as the top five concerns with over 42 percent of the respondents (cumulative) reporting to be victims of these, as per the Deloitte survey.

“Similarly, in the RBI annual report, while overall frauds reported decreased, ‘loan frauds’ have been highlighted as one major area of concern. This was based on the data provided by the banks for frauds above Rs 1 lakh,” Karthik said.

4. What are the reasons for banks’ failure to report frauds?

Ashvin Parekh, managing partner at Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services, said the key problem lies in recognising fraud, which is done by banks. After studying the frequency and severity of each fraud, the bank’s risk management committee must report each fraud to the board of directors, he said.

Governance plays a key role in the reporting of frauds, Parekh said.

“Frauds can not only cause financial loss but reputation risk to the bank as well. In many banks, for instance, you may find that the disclosure policy itself may be an open one, leaving decisions to executives. If the board is not vigilant and the risk management practices are weak, then frauds which occur may not be taken as seriously as some other banks may take. That is exactly what Kotak Bank is saying,” Parekh said.

Amit Das, cofounder of Think360.ai, said most banks and non-banking finance companies don’t report fraud comprehensively.

“There are challenges associated with tracking and reporting frauds consistently, resolving fraud-related issues, establishing clear accountability, off-system management, potential expose of internal process failures, reputation risk, among others. This is similar to the teething issues with bureau reporting in the earlier years,” Das said.

5. What is the RBI doing to tackle fraud disclosure challenges?

According to Karthik, the RBI has mandated banks to report all types of frauds. Banks need to furnish Fraud Monitoring Returns in individual fraud cases, irrespective of the amount involved.

The RBI asked banks to submit fraud reports in cases where central investigating agencies have initiated criminal proceedings suo moto and where the RBI has directed that such cases be reported as fraud, Karthik said, adding that the format for reporting of fraud to the RBI has been provided by the regulator in various circulars issued at regular intervals.

As Moneycontrol reported on August 29, the RBI is also working on a fraud registry aimed at keeping repeat offenders at bay from the banking system.

“The fraud registry will capture information like IP (internet protocol) addresses and phone numbers repeatedly used to commit frauds,” executive director Anil Kumar Sharma said on August 29.

“A mechanism for these details would be created so that banks can report these details to us. That will help us prevent these fraudsters using the banking infrastructure for perpetrating fraud after fraud after fraud,” he added.

6. What are banks doing to lower fraudulent transactions?

Public and private sector banks are raising customer awareness on frauds through digital campaigns, bankers said.

Sending messages and mails to customers advising them not to click on any unknown links, asking them not to provide private bank account information to others through calls and messages, and running digital campaigns to raise awareness are some of the measures, they said.

HDFC Bank recently launched a fraud awareness campaign called #StayVigil through which the bank will “educate people about fraud and its prevention techniques” and guide customers who have been defrauded of their savings.

7. Are better regulations needed to report frauds?

Bankers and analysts are divided on whether the RBI should introduce further fraud disclosure norms.

Das of Think360, who is in favour of further regulation, says there is a “big need” to standardise fraud reporting and fraud management norms across lenders. It will ensure consistency, better fraud repositories, deeper understanding of systemic or process failures, and swifter response to fraud events, he said. It will also allow for faster action against perpetrators, he added.

“Imagine a fraudster replicating the same modus operandi across multiple institutions and accounts and getting away with it because they are aware that no one is tracking aggressively,” Das said.

Mantri of Anand Rathi, on the other hand, said the present fraud disclosure norms are adequate and called for lenders to follow the existing procedure vigilantly.

“As per the RBI circular dated Sept. 29, 2016, frauds are classified under seven broad categories. This classification does not specifically include online/digital frauds. There could be a possibility of non-reporting of such instances. Else, I do not see any incentive for non-reporting,” Mantri said.

The RBI guidelines and internal norms of lending institutions are adequate, he said, adding that true compliance with policies, regular reviews and monitoring mechanisms can help in averting fraud."

Banking giants HDFC Bank and State Bank of India (SBI) plan to collectively raise up to Rs 10,000 crore through sales of perpetual bonds this week, The Economic Times reported on September 5 citing people aware of the development.

The fundraise points to credit demand comeback in the world's fifth largest economy as bankers expect an over 10 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) loan growth in the current fiscal.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

Perpetual, or Additional Tier 1 (AT-1), bonds are a type of perpetual debt instrument that banks use to augment their core equity base and thus comply with Basel III norms. These bonds were introduced by the Basel accord after the global financial crisis to protect depositors. These are relatively risky as investors – mostly institutional players – may lose their entire capital as happened in the case of Yes Bank in 2020.

The majority of these bonds include a call option in the fifth year.

According to the report, SBI plans to raise up to Rs 7,000 crore for which it is in talks with the LIC of India and the Unit Trust of India (UTI). Private insurers have also been approached, the ET report highlighted. The bank intends to offer about 7.70-7.80%.

HDFC Bank is seeking to raise up to Rs 3,000 crore on September 6 when its bonds will be up for bidding on the stock exchange platform, it noted. Standalone provident funds, large banks, and family offices might buy into these instruments that are expected to offer 7.80-7.95% returns, ET reported quoting dealers.

Last week, the Bank of Baroda issued AT-1 bonds worth Rs 2,474 crore at a cutoff of 7.88 percent.

As per the latest data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), banks’ credit offtake increased 15.3 percent y-o-y for the fortnight ended August 12, up from 5.5 percent in the year-ago period.

In absolute terms, banks’ overall outstanding advances stood at Rs 124.3 lakh crore as of August 12, growing by Rs 16.5 lakh crore over the last 12 months."
"September 05, 2022 07:53 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/rbi-in-talks-with-banks-fintech-for-digital-currency-rollout-in-fy23-9121831.html,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is holding consultations with a clutch of fintech companies and is said to have asked four public sector banks to run a pilot Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project ahead of a possible rollout this financial year.

The list of fintechs that the RBI is consulting include US-based FIS which has been holding roundtable conferences and workshops with central bankers globally on CBDCs.

The fintech company is advising central banks on CBDC topics such as offline payments, programmable payments, new monetary policy toolkit, interest-bearing CBDC, fractional banking issues, financial inclusion, and cross-border CBDC payments, Demidova said.

“FIS has had various engagements with the RBI...and, of course, our connected ecosystem could be extended to the RBI to experiment various CBDC options,” Julia Demidova, senior director at FIS, told Moneycontrol on September 2.

“Whether it is a wholesale or retail CBDC transaction, our technology can also be extended to commercial banks where they can test and tokenise central bank money in the form of digital regulated money,” Demidova added.

Legal status

CBDC is a currency that is backed by the regulator and stored in a digital format. It can be converted into paper currency and will reflect on the RBI’s balance sheet, thereby granting it legal tender status.

The RBI could use blockchain technology to develop its CBDC, with adequate regulations, experts said.

Additionally, the RBI has roped in four state-run banks to run a pilot CBDC project, according to two bank officials.

“The RBI has asked State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India and Bank of Baroda to run the pilot internally,” the official said, requesting anonymity.

Queries sent by Moneycontrol to the RBI, SBI, BoB and Union Bank for comments on the pilot CBDC project did not elicit a response by the time of publishing.

Another senior PSU bank official, however, confirmed the matter.

“There is a pilot on CBDCs. The RBI may come with the launch this year. When it will exactly roll out the product and specifications is to be seen,” the banker said.

According to Vikram Babbar, a partner and lead of financial services at EY, products like the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) gained momentum and have paved the way for the digital currency.

While cryptocurrencies have been in use for some time globally, the risks associated with their usage, including anonymity and the lack of a central agency backing, have been at the forefront and have attracted more frauds and financial crime incidents recently, he said.

To mitigate some of the risks, central banks and regulators like the RBI have planned to launch a fiat digital currency, he added.

“From an Indian standpoint, CBDC would further support financial inclusion and at the same time ensure that the risk of fraud and money laundering is minimised. This would additionally entail setting up the right infrastructure and monitoring mechanisms before the formal launch. For a country like India, testing with a pilot launch and planning a phased implementation may be an apt start,” Babbar said.

Act amended

On July 20, Ajay Kumar Choudhary, executive director at RBI, said that with the announcement of the CBDC launch in the Union Budget, the RBI Act of 1934 had been amended to enable the RBI to conduct the pilot project and subsequently issue the CBDC.

“The RBI is also working on phased implementation of a CBDC in both the wholesale and retail segments,” he added.

The ED’s comments are in line with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s statement on March 8, when she was quoted by PTI as saying, “It was a conscious call taken in consultation with the central bank – the Reserve Bank of India.... we would like them to design it the way they would like to do it, but this year we expect the currency to come out from the central bank itself.”

The finance minister had also said there are “clear advantages in a central bank driven digital currency because in this day and age, bulk payments happening between countries, large transactions between institutions and large transactions between central banks themselves of each country are all better enabled with digital currency.”"
"September 01, 2022 08:38 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy-2/sbi-slashes-fy23-growth-forecast-to-6-8-on-way-below-q1-numbers-9119001.html,"Chief economist at State Bank of India has revised downward the full-year growth forecast to a low 6.8 per cent from 7.5 per cent earlier for FY2023, citing ""the way below GDP numbers for the first quarter"".

The National Statistical Office on Wednesday released the Q1 growth numbers which showed a consensus growth of 13.5 per cent, pulled down by the poor show of the manufacturing sector, which reported a paltry 4.8 per cent expansion in the first three months of FY23, negating the robust show by the services sector.

Consensus forecast was 15-16.7 per cent of which the RBI made the highest forecast of 16.7 per cent. SBI group chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh had also forecast a 15.7 per cent growth for the first quarter.

The economy from the gross value added (GVA) also fared much lower than forecast, logging in only 12.7 per cent. At 13.5 per cent, real GDP growth has declined by 9.6 per cent sequentially, but the seasonally adjusted real GDP growth series shows pick-up in economic momentum, with higher growth at 5.6 per cent sequentially in Q1 compared to -4.1 per cent in Q1FY22 and 1.9 percent in Q4FY22, Ghosh, said in a note on Thursday.

The headline GDP numbers hide more things than these reveal and it's time to seriously introspect on the measurement of IIP and CPI baskets which were last revised in 2012, he said. Though the GDP grew in double-digits but still it came way below the market expectations and the primary culprit is growth in manufacturing sector which grew by a measly 4.8 per cent in Q1, Ghosh said, and pencilled in sharply lower fully year growth at 6.8 per cent.

Giving a break-up of the rest of the quarters, he expects Q2 to print in at 6.9 per cent, Q3 at 4.1 per cent and the final quarter to log in a low 4 per cent taking the full year number to be 6.8 per cent. ""We are now revising our annual GDP growth for FY23 to 6.8 per cent, mostly due to a statistical adjustments, but said growth momentum likely to show an increasing momentum in second half,"" Ghosh said.

He had earlier projected Q1 growth of 15.7 percent. What is more disappointing is that nominal GDP growth came in 26.7 per cent from 32.4 per cent in Q1 FY22 and 14.9 per cent in Q4FY22, led by private final consumption expenditure increasing in overall growth.

Private final consumption expenditure in real terms improved to 10 per cent, which is above the pre-pandemic level. The gap between nominal GDP growth and real GDP growth has increased between Q2FY20 and Q1FY22 owing to higher inflation. It moderated in Q2 and Q3FY22 but increased again in the last two quarters.

The growth in deflator has increased modestly to 11.6 percent in Q1FY23 from 10.4 percent in Q4FY22. Growth in GDP deflator for agriculture has increased further to 12.4 percent compared to 10.7 percent in Q4FY22, indicating the persistent impact of higher food prices, while industry growth deflator has increased mainly on account of mining and quarrying and electricity, gas, water supply & other utility services; and the services deflator has declined only in case of public administration, defence and other services.

He said there is a serious need for reestimating manufacturing sector growth needs in the sense that IIP is still indexed at 2012 base. The CPI basket has also not changed since 2012 and this has also possibly resulted in overstating CPI inflation at multiple times. Citing the example of manufacturing exports, he pointed out that till pre-pandemic, IIP and manufacturing exports moved in close tandem, but they completely diverged post-pandemic.

This is because, lot of incentives were announced under the PLI scheme, which led to an exponential jump in manufacturing exports. However, he notes that on the expenditure side the picture has improved considerably as private consumption has improved on the back of good urban demand with growth of 25.9 per cent.

He also said the much lower Q1 growth also compounds RBI's job, with rate hike trajectory in next two MPC meets trying to find a neutral ground amidst growth and inflation. On the external front the outlook is tilted towards the negative side with real exports growing only 14.7 percent as against imports growth of 37.2 percent. Sharp jump in imports and the rupee fall have taken down the net real exports to low 8.1 percent of GDP."

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank on August 30 said it wrote twice to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) during the current financial year requesting it to enforce standardisation in fraud reporting requirements by all banks.

“We have observed that there is significant variance in what is chosen to be reported to the regulator by other banks. We have appealed to the regulator vide our letters dated 17th March, 2022 and 30th August 2022 to enforce standardisation in reporting requirements,” the lender said in a clarification issued today to media reports.

The total number of frauds reported by Kotak Mahindra Bank to the regulator is in line with regulatory requirements and include instances of skimming, phishing, vishing, e-commerce frauds, across debit cards, credit cards, UPI, mobile banking, internet banking, payment gateways, among others, the bank said. “Regardless of whether customers and / or the bank faced losses, or whether the fraud amounts were recovered eventually,"" it added.

The clarification comes after a report said that Kotak Mahindra Bank recorded 5,278 cases of fraud in the first quarter (April to June) of the current financial year (2022-23), according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data. State Bank of India (SBI), meanwhile, reported only nine fraud cases during the same period, as per the report.

The media report cited data provided by Union Minister of State for Finance Bhagwant Karad to the Parliament on August 2.

As per the data, during the first quarter of current fiscal (Q1FY23), while some lenders declared no frauds, Kotak Mahindra Bank reported 5,278 frauds. Large banks including SBI reported 9 frauds during the first quarter of the current fiscal, while HDFC Bank reported 303 fraud cases, and ICICI Bank reported 436 cases of frauds.

Kotak Bank in its release today said for the period reported, of the 5,278 fraud instances reported by the bank to regulator, 97 percent of the complaints were associated to digital and card related frauds, that occur “due to customers unwittingly compromising their credentials by clicking on unknown links”, or giving access to their devices, among others.

“It is our submission that other banks do not appear to be exhaustively or uniformly reporting these types of frauds. Such frauds are not a reflection of any vulnerabilities in the bank’s secure infrastructure and systems,” Kotak Bank said.

As per RBI’s FY22 annual report, an assessment of bank group-wise fraud cases over the last three years indicates that while private sector banks have reported the maximum number of frauds, public sector banks contributed maximum to the fraud amount.

For instance, private lenders reported a total of 5,334 fraud cases amounting to over Rs 1 lakh during FY22, higher than 3,078 fraud cases reported by the state-led lenders. The total amount of frauds reported by private banks during the previous fiscal stood at Rs 17,588 crore while public sector banks reported frauds amounting to Rs 40,282 crore during the same period.

On an overall basis, lenders reported a total of 9,103 fraud related cases amounting to Rs 60,414 crore during FY22, lower than Rs 1.38 lakh crore of frauds reported during FY21.

Frauds have been occurring predominantly in the loan portfolio and while the number of frauds reported by private sector banks were mainly on account of small value card or internet frauds, the fraud amount reported by public sector banks was mainly in loan portfolio, the RBI annual report said.

Moneycontrol on August 29 reported that the RBI is working on a fraud registry that would help it keep repeat offenders at bay from the banking system.

""The fraud registry will capture information like IP (internet protocol) addresses and phone numbers repeatedly used to commit frauds,"" Executive Director Anil Kumar Sharma said on August 29.

""A mechanism for these details would be created so that banks can report these details to us. That will help us prevent these fraudsters using the banking infrastructure for perpetrating fraud after fraud after fraud,"" he added."

Wonder why your bank's system is down quite often or why you face transaction declines repeatedly?

A Moneycontrol investigation into tech glitches reported by Indian banks across multiple platforms — mobile and internet — over the last few years has revealed major fundamental problems in their operations.

For one, most banks, including bigger ones, continue to use outdated technology platforms, making upgrades difficult. Secondly, these banks severely lack the adequate number of talented tech professionals to support large-scale tech-enabled banking operations, often resulting in major delays in the event of an outage.

Moneycontrol studied the tech outages reported by at least six banks in the recent past and spoke to at least 10 officials from these banks and technology firms.

Rising customer complaints

According to the central bank’s 2021 ombudsman scheme annual report, customers submitted a total of 44,385 complaints related to mobile and electronic banking between April 2020 and March 2021, higher than the 41,310 complaints recorded by the regulator in the previous year.

This is at a time when banks continue to launch new digital initiatives and so-called super apps.

To give an example, on June 30, a Twitter user posted a “maintenance” break screenshot from State Bank of India’s (SBI) banking application YONO. He complained that the bank had shared no communication with customers to alert them of the service outage.

As per the screenshot, the app’s services were not supposed to be available till 7 pm on June 30.

“19:00 hours already passed…,” Verma replied to his original tweet after the maintenance break passed its deadline. The same day saw many similar complaints by users saying that India’s largest public sector bank had not sent any prior notice for the scheduled break at a time when the country is pushing for further digitisation.

Source: Twitter

SBI is not the only one facing heat for such issues. On August 17, multiple Twitter users posted complaints of not being able to log into the bank website or app of India’s largest private sector bank – HDFC Bank. Similarly on August 13, many complained that net banking was not working since morning that day.



@HDFC_Bank your netbanking site not working from today morning, please check and resolve the problem

— Satish Kumar (@SatishKRoy1976) August 13, 2022

“@HDFC_Bank your netbanking is down since an hour. I have payments to make and your site is just not working. Is it down for maintenance? If yes, no email or messages or any prior intimation was given to me,” tweeted user Ishita Shah.

Last year, the bank faced the wrath of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) after five major outages between November 2018 and March 2021. While RBI lifted the ban on all launches of its upcoming digital business-generating activities later, RBI’s diktat set the bank behind in competing with its peer ICICI Bank in credit card issuances as well as new digital initiatives.

Both SBI and HDFC Bank did not respond to detailed queries by Moneycontrol on the scheduled maintenance break or on the service outage.

Twitter is full of similar complaints across banks -- multiple users facing problems at once on some days.

What is the core issue?

The biggest strength of India’s largest banks is also the biggest Achilles' heel when it comes to technology – scale. Besides the burden on internal tech systems to handle the rising volumes of digital transactions, these are legacy systems with a heavy dependence on external service providers that plug in each layer of tech for banks.

“The large banks have the issue of using legacy technology from years ago. The bigger you are, the more difficult it is to upgrade. The risk is immense even while migrating from a large old database to a new one,” said the technology head of a leading fintech.

The core banking system of most banks is provided by large information technology players, including Infosys’ Finacle, Oracle and BaNCS by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). With the core system being operated by tech teams of these IT giants, internal teams of most banks only ensure that these systems are kept up and running.

“In one of our conversations with a smaller private bank that positioned itself as a digital bank, we were told that they have a tech team of 400 people. But not a single one of them wrote any code. Their entire job was to deal with their IT vendors,” the person added.

In such a situation, many experts believe that internal bank teams are largely deployed for ‘requirement management’ and not equipped to fix larger issues or build for evolving needs of customers.

Legacy problems

Aishwarya Jaishankar, who has led digital initiatives at various private sector banks and is now Co-Founder of Hyperface which provides tech stack for credit cards, said, “The core banking systems were built for the back offices and branches of banks and have scaled from there. But now modern customers want to be served digitally, needing a front-end focussed experience that banks are struggling to create with pure-play core banking systems.”

The core banking systems too are legacy software built over the past two decades and have reached a scale that makes it difficult to upgrade these to handle the increasing volumes. Hence, the knowledge required to operate these systems too is similar to what was required years ago.

Harshavardhan Godugula, Partner, Forensic and Integrity Services, EY, said, “Traditionally, core banking platforms are centralised systems – on top of which banks have built newer applications and capabilities, such as mobile banking, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), etc. Sometimes, these legacy systems are unable to perform adequately and face system downtime, vulnerabilities, hardware failures, etc. If banking apps are not built and tested properly, they are bound to throw back errors.”

Another disadvantage for large legacy banks is the difficulty in attracting the right talent and pay disparity as compared to large IT players and startups. “Large financial institutions have a hierarchical structure that makes decision-making difficult,” said another fintech founder.

Hyperface’s Jaishankar added, “While core banking is resilient, it has not evolved at the rate that innovation has taken place. Banks have to plug more third-party switches into the existing systems as the usage of real-time payments and other innovations increase pressure on the system.”

Nilufer Mullanfiroze, who has over two decades of experience working with banks like Standard Chartered and Federal Bank and is now Head of Banking at investment startup Groww argued that the time for technology to become redundant is only becoming shorter. Hence, it is not practical to expect large institutions to redo their systems.

""But what needs to be the practical approach with most banks is to have the right infrastructure to build things on top of their core banking systems. Having the agility to be able to use the core banking system more as the backend system and build the right interfaces with newer age technology is the way to go for the future,"" she added.

The tide, however, has changed for the better after the regulator took cognisance of major outages across banks. Top management across banks are now more aware of the limitations of their technical capacities and seem to be working with the regulator around challenges.

Finally, the UPI hiccup…

“Since the last few days, when we try to send or receive money through UPI apps, the SBI server is down very often. Nowadays, people carry very less cash in hand. How are we supposed to transact seamlessly in such a scenario,” Sanket Rathi, an SBI customer for more than 10 years told Moneycontrol.

Failures on UPI payment systems are basically of two types, technical decline (TD) and business decline (BD). Technical declines are caused due to issues with the bank's system or NPCI systems, while business declines are caused due to issues pertaining to customers, such as incorrect PINs or transactions beyond stipulated limits.

“If we compare TDs to BDs, the former is always lesser than the latter. This is a clear result of seamlessness,” Venkatraman Venkateswaran, chief financial officer (CFO) at Federal Bank said.

To counter issues relating to reconciliation of timed out and declined transactions on the UPI platform, we might soon see the emergence of a tech that will allow real-time settlement of such transactions, he added.

Numbers don’t lie

The top five UPI remitter banks in terms of volumes in July were SBI, HDFC Bank, Bank of Baroda, Union Bank and ICICI Bank. For example, SBI's approval rate of UPI transactions was at 92.1 percent in July. The bank’s business decline rate stood at 7.26 percent as compared to 6.96 percent in June. The technical decline rate saw a steep drop to 0.68 percent in July from over 5 percent in June.

While the decline rates keep fluctuating every month, for the user dependent on UPI for all transactions, this is a major road bump. So why do UPI downtimes happen with banks?

Banks as well as the RBI have taken cognisance of the burden that the rise in UPI transactions has put on bank servers. Since the pandemic struck in March 2020, UPI monthly transaction values have grown by 5x from Rs 2 lakh crore to Rs 10.62 lakh crore in July 2022. What’s more is that UPI is used for multiple small-ticket transactions, including paying for an auto ride or even your local tea stall owner.

With over 600 crore transactions a month, the stress on bank servers is high.

“To add to that, the innovation is happening faster than the time banks can take to handle the growing transactions. With RuPay credit cards on UPI and UPI 123Pay, the number of transactions is expected to grow significantly,” said a senior executive of a payments company.

So, what are banks doing to address these problems?

Large banks are working towards pre-empting the problems that may emerge in the coming years as digital adoption increases further.

“While other private banks are trying to get their house in order, ICICI Bank is preparing for a wider presence in getting embedded across a large number of platforms where users transact. It is also preparing to scale horizontally and vertically,” said the founder of a fintech and bank infrastructure provider.

ICICI Bank did not respond to Moneycontrol’s request to participate in the story.

HDFC Bank chief executive officer Sashidhar Jagdishan, in a mail to employees in April 2021, had said that the bank has invested heavily in scaling up the infrastructure to handle any potential load that it will encounter for the next three to five years.

The bank is also setting up a digital factory and an enterprise factory to roll out new digital offerings and to help augment the bank’s IT infrastructure.

As for SBI, multiple reports suggest that the bank is in the process of upgrading its YONO app to offer a completely digital banking offering.

Another outlier is Federal Bank. The bank is known to invest heavily in modernising its internal tech capabilities, cloud adoption as well as target growth through tie-ups with fintechs. As per, customers are extensively using the bank’s internet banking platform due to the constant investments it has made.

“The enterprise or individual of today doesn't want to experience buffering pages. The 'lift and shift' model (migrating apps and data to cloud) of ensuring early adoption of tech will ensure that the sector is near glitch-free,” Federal Bank’s Venkateswaran said.

Union Bank of India General Manager Sanjay Narayan, who leads the lender’s digital initiatives, said that the lender has put in place a board-approved compensation policy whereby the bank compensates the customer for any financial loss that they may incur due to deficiency in service on the part of the bank, or any act of omission or commission directly attributable to the bank.

“With the growing customer base and increase in the number of digital products, robust infrastructure is a must. Adding new hardware to accommodate the continuous increase in digital transactions and customer base has become one of the important aspects of providing hassle-free banking services. Cloud is one of the growing spaces being used by entities for expansion of infrastructure,” Narayan said.

The UPI puzzle — To invest or not?

On UPI, industry experts have pointed out that banks see less incentive in investing further for UPI transactions as payment systems don't fetch enough revenues for banks and payment service providers, as per government norms.

“UPI has also introduced an orchestration approach due to its scale, something that was rarely conspicuous in the Indian banking system. But ensuring scalability with the right agility and security has its own costs. Government incentive will be helpful to take care of some of the costs associated with UPI,” Venkateswaran said.

In December 2021, the government had announced a Rs 1,300 crore scheme to incentivise banks, and through them payment gateways and UPI players for transactions. To be eligible for the full incentive, banks were required to show at least 50 percent year-on-year growth in UPI transactions by the end of the last quarter of the scheme.

With the Union Ministry of Finance’s recent clarification that the government has no plans to levy charges on UPI transactions, CRISIL Research Director Aniket Dani said that further government incentives in promoting UPI will aid in the upgradation of the existing services.

“The Ministry of Finance asserted on August 22 that would continue lending financial support to boost the digital payments ecosystem in the country. This help from the government will, in turn, aid the parties in the transaction to get monetary remuneration for the probable expenses associated with the same,” Dani said."

SBI has sold the non-performing loan account of KSK Mahanadi Power Company to Aditya Birla ARC for Rs 1,622 crore, accepting a haircut of almost 58 per cent against the total outstanding.

KSK Mahanadi Power Company had total loan outstanding of Rs 3,815.04 crore towards State Bank of India (SBI) as of April 2022.

""SBI initiated open offer e-auction towards sale of fund based exposure of KSK Mahanadi Power Co. Ltd on 100 per cent cash basis on April 20, 2022 for a reserve price of Rs 1,544.08 crore,"" SBI said in a regualtory filing on Thursday.

The state-owned lender had received a total of 15 expression of interests (EoIs), while only one bid was received from Aditya Birla ARC for an amount of Rs 1,544.08 crore in an auction in end-May.

In a Swiss challenge auction process in June, the lender said it received no competing bids and based on subsequent discussions, Aditya Birla ARC improved the offer to Rs 1,622 crore. SBI said the sale concluded on August 12, 2022 after getting approval from competent internal authorities.

Prior to this, the lender had put the e-auction of KSK Mahanadi on hold in December 2021 citing administrative reasons. At that time, the total outstanding against the company stood over Rs 4,100 crore.

The CBI on Thursday conducted searches at 25 locations in connection with a case of coins worth Rs 11 crore going missing from the vaults of an SBI branch in Karauli in Rajasthan, officials said Friday. The central agency had registered the case on April 13 following an order of the Rajasthan High Court, they said.

The searches were spread across 25 locations in Delhi, Jaipur, Dausa,a Karauli, Sawai Madhopur, Alwar, Udaipur and Bhilwara at the premises of around 15 former bank officials and others, they said. The matter came to light after the State Bank of India (SBI) branch decided to carry out counting of money after a preliminary enquiry indicated discrepancy in its cash reserve in August, 2021.

The counting was outsourced to a private vendor which revealed that over Rs 11 crore worth of coins were missing from the branch. Only 3,000 coin bags carrying about Rs 2 crore could be accounted for and were transferred to the RBI's coin holding branch."

Banks create a pool of funds to cover non-performing assets (NPAs) and potential NPAs and these funds are classified as provisions. Provision coverage ratio (PCR), on the other hand, refers to the percentage of funds created against NPAs. A higher PCR ratio reflects that the bank has sufficient capital to withstand asset quality pressures and will not need significant incremental capital in case of extreme stress. Large banks including State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank maintained a PCR of over 70 percent as on June end, which is “prescribed” as an ideal level by the RBI."

The startup branch is located in Koramangala, alongside HSR Layout and Indiranagar which are the biggest startup hubs in the city.

The bank’s subsidiaries like mutual funds and custodial services would also be partnering in the initiative.

The branch would act as a hub with various stakeholders assisting in providing solutions acting as spokes and supporting the hub branch in enabling the start-ups to avail end-to-end financial and advisory services through the branch, SBI said in the statement.

Shares of Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar nosedived over 14 percent to Rs 8.68 apiece in early trade on August 17 after the State Bank of India filed an insolvency petition in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against the sugar manufacturing company.

The petition has been filed at the Allahabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the company said in an exchange filing on August 16. It did not share more details.

As per media reports, Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar owes nearly Rs 4,800 crore to banks like SBI, Punjab National Bank, Indian Bank and Central Bank of India.

















Creditors typically file insolvency petitions in the company court for non-payment of dues. Once the court admits the petition, insolvency proceedings against the company begin.















Bajaj Hindusthan is a sugar and ethanol manufacturing company. Part of the Bajaj Group, it is headquartered in Mumbai.

The company has 14 sugar plants—all of them in Uttar Pradesh–and six distilleries with the capacity to produce 800 kilo litres of industrial alcohol a day.

The company also generates close to 430 megawatt (MW) of power from the bagasse produced at its sugar mills and supplies nearly 100 MW from it to the Uttar Pradesh state grid.

It also has five 90 MW coal-fired power plants adjacent to its sugar units, which generate another 450 MW of electricity for the state grid.

In the April-June quarter, the company reported a net loss of Rs 44.91 crore as against a net loss of Rs 49.72 crore in the same quarter of the previous financial year. Sales rose 13.11 percent to Rs 1,529.92 crore in the reporting quarter as against Rs 1,352.61 crore last year."

The increase in lending rate comes days after the Reserve Bank of India hiked its benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points to tame inflation.

External Benchmark based Lending Rate (EBLR) and Repo-Linked Lending Rate (RLLR) have been raised by 50 basis points while the hike in Marginal Cost of funds-based Lending Rate (MCLR) is 20 basis points across all tenure. The revised rates are effective from August 15, as per the information posted on SBI website.

SBI's EBLR rose to 8.05 per cent and RLLR increased by similar 50 basis points to 7.65 per cent. Banks add Credit Risk Premium (CRP) over the EBLR and RLLR while giving any kind of loan, including housing and auto loans.

With the revision, one-year MCLR has increased to 7.70 per cent, from the earlier 7.50 per cent, while for two years it rose to 7.90 per cent and for three years to 8 per cent. Most of the loans are linked to the one-year MCLR rate.

With the increase in lending rate, EMIs will go up for those borrowers who have availed loans on MCLR, EBLR or RLLR. From October 1, 2019, all banks including SBI have migrated to an interest rate linked to an external benchmark such as RBI's repo rate or Treasury Bill yield. As a result, monetary policy transmission by banks has gained traction."

State Bank of India (SBI) has said it expects to sustain credit growth of about 15 per cent in the current fiscal with rising demand from retail and corporate borrowers despite hardening of lending rate. The country's largest lender reported a 14.93 per cent rise in advances to Rs 29,00,636 crore in the first quarter ended June 30, 2022 as compared to Rs 25,23,793 crore during the same period a year ago.

Of this, retail loan registered a growth rate of 18.58 per cent while corporate advances improved by 10.57 per cent year-on-year at the end of June quarter. SBI chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara also said that the bank will soon come out with only YONO which is YONO 2.0 with many more advanced features and functionalities.

""The digital leadership journey of the bank is continuing. More than 96.6 per cent of the transactions are now routed through alternate channels. The registered users on YONO have already crossed 5.25 crore, a big milestone and which has created a significant value for the bank. Sixty-five per cent of the new savings accounts are opened through YONO,"" he said at an analyst call recently. On maintaining 15 per cent credit growth, he said, ""I am quite hopeful the reason behind is kind of a term loan and also the underutilisation of the working capital, which is all aggregating to almost Rs 5 lakh crore, and the pipeline is almost Rs 1.2 lakh crore. So, I'm quite hopeful that we should be in a position to sustain this in the subsequent quarters.""

Corporate book should grow to the extent of about Rs 2.5-3 lakh crore during the year, he said, adding, even in SME (Small and Medium Enterprises) there are traction and pipeline is getting created. With the latest rate hike by RBI, the repo rate (short term lending rate at which banks borrow from the central bank) increased to 5.40 per cent, an increase of 140 basis points since May this year.

On the prevailing economic situation, Khara said the effect of the Covid pandemic has subdued to a large extent, thanks to the governments' massive vaccination programme. The economy is almost on track with the resumption of air travel and removal of other containment measures by most of the countries, he said.

However, he said, the volatile geopolitical situation still poses a downside risk. The global output has contracted in the second quarter of this year going to the downturn in China and Russia. The Indian economy remains resilient despite global headwinds, resulting in rise in inflation, surge in crude prices, increase in commodity prices and disruption in supply chains, he said."

India’s home loan market, currently valued at about Rs 24 lakh crore, is expected to double in the next five years, mirroring the overall trend in the country’s aspirations to become a $5 trillion economy by then, State Bank of India said in a report.

The share of housing loans in bank credit increased to 14.4 percent in June from 13.1 percent in March 2020, with the maximum number of disbursements in tier-3 and tier-4 cities, according to the SBI report.

Analysts said that the fear of further rate hikes and loosing out the opportunity to buy properties will drive the customers to invest in homes.

SBI, PNB Housing Finance and Bank of Baroda are among those that recorded significant growth in their home loan portfolios, according to their latest quarterly results.

Analysts said once the interest rate hike cycle starts, people tend to take home loans faster because they anticipate further hikes and fear that the longer they wait, the more expensive home loans will become.

The Reserve Bank of India has increased the benchmark interest rate by 140 basis points since May to curb inflationary pressures in the economy.

Disbursal of housing loans rose significantly in the April-June quarter and contributed almost half of the total personal and retail loans disbursed, according to SBI’s data.

Post-COVID security

When the RBI announced the rate hikes, analysts predicted that credit growth in the housing sector might get affected. However, the rate hikes created a positive impact in the last quarter.

“Firstly, it takes around three to four quarters to reflect the real impact of rate hike on loans. Now, banks have become more proactive as housing loans performed well in the last few quarters. Moreover, after COVID, people are now looking for safety and having his/her own house gives a sense of safety,” said Prakash Agarwal, director & head financial institutions at India Ratings & Research.

Moreover, analysts pointed out, banks convince customers to take loans at the earliest, before the interest rate goes up further, and this resulted in the rise in home loan disbursals.

Non-metropolitan areas

The report showed that growth in loans disbursed was primarily in non-metropolitan areas.

The total home loan portfolio (outstanding) grew by more than 10 percent in FY22, with tier-3 and tier-4 areas growing at a faster rate than tier-1 and tier-2 districts after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the SBI report.

The average loan size increased more in the smaller towns. The report noted that growth of loans in the Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh and the Rs 50 lakh to Rs 100 lakh brackets was higher in tier-3 areas than in tier-1 districts.

“If we also look at the coverage of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban scheme, which focusses on bridging the housing demand-supply mismatch in the country, the share of the Top 50 districts is a mere 21 percent in overall number of houses sanctioned. This clearly suggests the well-distributed nature of the PMAY-U scheme and one of the prime reasons for growth of housing finance across geographies beyond top cities,” said Aniket Dani, director, CRISIL Research.

According to analysts, the metros have become super-saturated and extremely expensive. So people now look for property that is affordable yet spacious.

“It may not be possible for an individual to buy a 2BHK apartment in Mumbai. But a bigger apartment will be affordable for him or her in Nashik or other districts. With the advantage of work from home, people don’t mind coming once in a while to office in the metros and then work remotely,” said Prakash Diwan, analyst and director at Altamount Capital Management.

It's mostly people who have spent a long time in the metros who choose to live in the smaller towns with better climatic conditions, more space and good accessibility, the analysts said."

Leading a consortium of lenders, SBI infused emergency capital amounting to Rs 10,000 crore in the distressed Yes Bank in 2020 when it approached bankruptcy. The embargo on SBI and other lenders to hold their shares in Yes Bank as part of a reconstruction scheme ends in 2023.

SBI, however, could potentially continue to maintain its holding in the Mumbai-headquartered bank even after the embargo ends on account of a good return on investment, Yes Bank managing director and chief executive officer Prashant Kumar told Moneycontrol on August 3.

“If any investment is giving me a good return, I have seen, as a behaviour, people would like to continue. But again, these calls will be taken by individual entities,” Kumar said.

Kumar’s comments came after Yes Bank announced that it would raise $1.1 billion in equity capital from private equity investors Carlyle and Advent International.

Q1FY23 earnings

SBI’s Q1FY23 net profit came in at Rs 6,068.1 crore, down 7 percent year-on-year (YoY) and 33 percent sequentially on account of loss in the treasury book and higher operating expenses.

Its other income, which includes treasury income, stood at Rs 2,312.2 crore, sharply lower from Rs 11,802.7 crore a year ago and Rs 11,880.2 crore in the previous quarter.

Net profit and operating profit were impacted by mark-to-market losses (MTM), Khara said, adding core revenue streams, however, remained intact and showed decent on-year growth.

“As we saw a hit on account of mark-to-market losses amounting to Rs 6,549 crore on our investment book, it also had an adverse impact on the bank’s RoA (return on asset) and RoE (Return on equity), which is down by 9 bps and 203 bps, respectively,” Khara said.

“As rates soften (bond yields), we will recover most of these MTM losses,” he added.

SBI has the largest portfolio of fixed income securities of which government securities form a big chunk. The rise in bond yields during the June quarter saw the lender incur huge losses in its trading book. When bond yields rise, their prices come down.

Banks are mandated to mark their investments to prevailing market prices and charge the gains or losses to the profit and loss account, also known as mark-to-market gains or losses.

In terms of assets, SBI’s total loans grew 14.9 percent YoY and 2.9 percent sequentially to Rs 29 lakh crore as on June 30, in line with the industry average.

Of the total advances, domestic corporate loans grew 10.6 percent to Rs 8.74 lakh crore as on June end. Retail personal loans grew 18.6 percent YoY to Rs 10.34 lakh crore during the same period and home loans rose 13.8 percent on year at Rs 5.75 lakh crore.

“We are quite comfortable as far as supporting growth in credit is concerned,” Khara says.

The chairman said that the bank was witnessing sharp under-utilisation of capital from the sanctioned loan amount. In case of working capital loans, under-utilisation level was as high as 49 percent, he added.

Broadly, Khara said, SBI had about Rs 5 lakh crore of unutilised pending sanctioned loans and another Rs 1.3 lakh crore of corporate loans were in the pipeline.

“That very clearly indicates the likely growth which we are going to witness on the corporate side,” Khara said.

With demand flowing in from sectors including power, road, telecom, petrochemical, aviation and non-banking finance companies, SBI would likely continue growing its advances at 15 percent in the current fiscal, Khara said.

“Even the capacity utilisation in the economy is at 75 percent, and we have got a situation where I think more corporates will probably be looking at us for availing their credit facility as compared to options that were available in the past, in terms of raising money from securities market…,” Khara said.

Asset quality

Even as SBI’s headline gross non-performing asset ratio improved 6 bps QoQ to 3.91 percent as of June 30, its fresh slippages were sharply higher QoQ.

Fresh slippages rose to Rs 9,740 crore, up from Rs 2,845 crore a quarter ago. Fresh slippages, however, were lower than Rs 15,666 crore reported during Q1FY22.

“Slippages we should rather see much better situation…we are not having any major concerns on slippages and asset quality we don’t have any challenge,” Khara said in the press conference.

“…for all practical purposes, we compare (fresh slippages) on YoY basis,” Khara said. He added that SBI was trying to trim net NPA as well as credit cost as much as possible.

“It is a constant endeavour (to improve asset quality),” the chairman said.

Further, SBI’s Rs 28,785 crore restructured book was also performing better than expected. “If you look at NPAs itself in the restructured book, it would be somewhere around 1.9 percent, so when we compare it to broader book, it is much better,” Khara said."

Here are the five takeaways from India's largest lender’s report card for the first quarter of the financial year 2022-23:

1 Other income falls

SBI’s other income for the quarter ended June 30 stood at Rs 2,312.2 crore, sharply lower from Rs 11,802.7 crore a year ago and Rs 11,880.2 crore in the previous quarter.

The state-owned lender's other income includes fee income, earnings from foreign exchange and derivative transactions, profit or loss from sale or revaluation of investments, dividend from subsidiaries and recoveries made in written-off accounts.

“Operating profit for Q1FY23 at Rs 12,753 crores as against Rs. 18,975 crores in Q1FY22, impacted by MTM (mark-to-market) losses on investment book. The MTM hit also had an adverse impact on bank’s RoA (return on asset) and RoE (return on equity), which stand at 0.48 percent and 10.09 percent, respectively,” the bank said in a release on August 6.

SBI has the largest portfolio of fixed income securities of which government securities form a big chunk. The rise in bond yields during the June quarter saw the lender incur huge losses in its trading book. When bond yields rise, their prices come down.

Banks are mandated to mark their investments to prevailing market prices and charge the gains or losses to the profit and loss account, also known as mark-to-market gains or losses.

As banks have been witnessing a downtrend in other income primarily due to a hit on treasury books, they are now focusing on growing their other income through fees from various third-party products.

“We have other sources of income, and we feel that the markets will correct themselves and we may see an upward trend in treasury income at least in September (quarter),” Union Bank Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD & CEO) A Manimekhalai told Moneycontrol in an interaction on August 1.

2 Stable advances growth

As per the release, SBI's total advances grew 14.9 percent YoY and 2.9 percent sequentially to Rs 29 lakh crore, in line with the industry average.

Of the total advances, domestic corporate loans grew 10.6 percent to Rs 8.74 lakh crore as on June end. Retail personal loans grew 18.6 percent YoY to Rs 10.34 lakh crore during the same period and home loans rose 13.8 percent on year at Rs 5.75 lakh crore.

3 Deposits stable but CASA ratio dips QoQ

SBI’s total deposits grew 8.7 percent YoY to Rs 40.45 lakh crore as on June 30.

Domestic low-cost current account and savings account deposit (CASA) rose 6.5 percent on year to Rs 17.67 lakh crore during the quarter. The CASA ratio, however, was 64 basis points (bps) lower on year at 45.33 percent. One basis is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

On account of stable loan growth, SBI’s net interest income, the difference between interest earned and expended, grew 12.9 percent on year to Rs 31,196 crore during the April-June period.

Domestic net interest margin, a key indicator of lenders’ profitability, stood at 3.23 percent during Q1, 17 bps lower on a sequential basis but 8 bps higher YoY.

4 Asset quality sustains

SBI’s headline gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratio stood at 3.91 percent as of June 30, 6 bps lower on a sequential basis. Its net NPA ratio stood at 1 percent, 2 bps lower quarter-on-quarter (QoQ).

Provisions for NPAs remained 15.1 percent lower YoY at Rs 4,268.1 crore. The provision coverage ratio (PCR), meanwhile, was at 90.14 percent.

Provisions refer to the amount a bank needs to set aside to cover the losses from a loan account. When an account turns into an NPA, the provisions required will equal the full loan amount.​

The bank’s fresh slippage ratio increased to 1.38 percent during Q1 from 0.43 percent last quarter. The credit cost ratio, or the amount set aside for potential bad loans, stood at 0.61 percent during the reporting quarter, higher than 0.49 percent a quarter ago.

5 Operating expenses high

Even as its other income dipped in the June quarter, SBI's operating expenses also remained high, impacting Q1 bottomline, analysts said.

The bank's operating expenses stood at Rs 8,704.2 crore, up from Rs 7,928.1 crore in the year-ago quarter.

SBI’s capital adequacy ratio stood at 13.43 percent, lower than 13.83 percent in the March quarter and 13.66 percent in the same quarter of the previous year. Its common-equity tier-I ratio was at 9.72 percent, while additional tier-I capital was at 1.43 percent during the same period."

State Bank of India on August 6 reported a net profit of Rs 6,068 crore for the June quarter, missing the Street estimates by a wide margin as treasury losses eroded profitability.

The average estimates of ten brokerages surveyed by Moneycontrol expected net profit at Rs 7,496 crore, a growth of 16 percent year-on-year (YoY). In contrast, India’s largest lender reported a drop of 6.7 percent in its profit after tax.

SBI has the largest portfolio of fixed income securities of which government securities form a big chunk. The sharp rise in bond yields during the April-June period meant that the lender had to incur huge losses in its trading book.

When bond yields rise, their prices come down. Banks are mandated to mark their investments to prevailing market prices and charge the gains or losses to the profit and loss account, also known as mark-to-market gains or losses.

The mark-to-market hit of Rs 6549 crore dragged SBI’s non-interest income down massively to a mere Rs 2,312 crore from Rs 11,802 crore in the year-ago quarter. This resulted in a fall of 32.8 percent in operating profit to Rs 12,753 crore for the quarter.

Chairman Dinesh Khara said the bank has taken measures to mitigate further losses from an increase in yields. ""We now seem fully insulated from rising bond yields,"" he said in a virtual press meet.

Beyond the treasury hit, SBI’s core performance was resilient.

Net interest income, the difference between the interest income the bank earns from its lending activities and the interest it paid to depositors, grew by a healthy 12.87 percent to Rs 31,196 crore for the June quarter on the back of a robust 14.9 percent loan growth and stable margins.

Provisions toward bad loans declined, as asset quality improved. Provisions declined 15 percent to Rs 4268 crore for the three months ended June 30, aiding net profit growth.

Balance sheet growth

SBI’s loan book showed a broad-based growth of 14.9 percent, as both corporate and retail loan books grew at a healthy pace.

Most analysts had expected the loan growth to be 14-15 percent for the quarter. Corporate loans grew by 10.57 percent YoY, while the retail book grew faster at 18.58 percent powered by strong growth in home loans.

Net interest margin (NIM) came in at 3.23 percent, an improvement of 8 basis points. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. That said, NIM was down sequentially.

As SBI’s loans earned it more interest due to lending rate hikes that the bank took during the quarter, growth in its low-cost deposits helped keep the cost of funds low.

Current and savings account deposits grew by 6.5 percent and formed 45.33 percent of the total deposit book. Deposits as a whole grew by 8.73 percent for the quarter.

Asset quality

SBI’s gross bad loans ratio improved from the year-ago period and its already strong provision cushion strengthened further.

The total pile of gross bad loans declined 15 percent from a year ago to Rs 1.13 lakh crore as of June end. Gross bad loans formed 3.91 percent of the loan book as against 5.32 percent in the same quarter of the previous financial year.

On a net basis, non-performing loans formed just 1 percent of the total loan book. Slippages, too, remained contained with the slippage ratio at 1.38 percent, down from 2.47 percent a year ago. Fresh slippages were down 37 percent to Rs 9,740 crore from Rs 15,666 crore a year ago.

That said, asset quality metrics weakened on a sequential basis. The slippage ratio was up 95 basis points from the previous quarter. In fact, June quarter slippages exceeded that of the previous three quarters put together.

Khara said the bank sees no challenges on asset quality, both from corporate and retail loans. Small business loans, though may pose some trouble if the recovery slows. The bank is targeting net bad loans to be 1 percent or less going forward.

The lender, however, won't shun riskier loans by only underwriting top-rated entities, Khara said. ""Our endeavour would be to keep credit costs low but we are very mindful that there is a risk involved and we cannot only underwrite AAA,"" he said.

He added that mispricing of risk has come down as liquidity surplus in the banking system was coming down. Following the coronavirus pandemic, SBI warned that a surge in liquidity surplus due to an easy monetary policy could be leading to banks' mispricing or underpricing riskier loans.

SBI aims to balance incremental risks arising out of lending towards small businesses or lower-rated companies. The bank has got board approval to raise Rs 11,000 crore capital to grow its loan book in FY23."
"August 06, 2022 10:36 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/sbi-q1-preview-net-profit-seen-16-up-but-treasury-could-be-a-drag-8950361.html,"State Bank of India (SBI) is expected to report robust balance sheet growth, improvement in asset quality and healthy core interest income for the June quarter.

Treasury operations could prove to be the Achilles’ heel of the country’s largest lender in the quarter ended June, for which it will report its earnings on August 6.

An average of the estimates by 10 securities firms shows that SBI’s June quarter net profit would be Rs 7,495 crore, up 16 percent year-on-year.

That would come on 17% growth in net interest income, seen at Rs 32,424 crore for the quarter. This would be one of the strongest growth rates in core interest income (NII) for the bank in recent times.

Interest margin

The increase in NII is driven by the bank’s ability to earn more out of lending and at the same time reduce the amount of dud loans on which it doesn’t earn any interest.

To that extent, movement in the net interest margin also reflects the core interest income besides overall loan growth.

SBI’s NIM remained stable, even improved, in FY22 because of its advantage over peers in having a large base of low-cost current and savings account (CASA) deposits.

CASA as a percentage of total deposits was 45 percent in FY22 with the added benefit that SBI pays one of the lowest interest rates on its savings deposits.

Analysts believe NIM would have remained stable in the June quarter and some expect a sequential improvement.

“Sequential NII growth would be healthy due to positive loan mix changes and yield on advances evolving higher at a faster pace than cost of deposits due to repricing of externally benchmarked loans, implying NIM expansion on sequential basis,” those at Yes Securities Ltd wrote in an earnings preview.

Lending growth

Loan growth is expected to be healthy and in double digits. “Retail growth is likely to remain strong. This, along with a pick-up in the SME (small and medium enterprise) and Corporate book (as the un-utilized limit continues to moderate), will support loan growth,” Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a report.

Analysts expect loans to expand by 14-15 percent year-on-year, led by retail and SMEs.

Asset quality, treasury losses

That brings us the asset quality and here analysts seem to differ on the extent of improvement. Those at Kotak Institutional Equities see overall improvement in bad-loan ratios but slippages may come in slightly higher.

“We expect slippages at 1.6% of loans (Rs11,000 crore) mostly driven by SME and retail while corporate will continue to hold up relatively well,” Kotak analysts wrote in their note.

SBI’s slippage ratio was 1.1 percent in the March quarter. Analysts at Axis Securities expect slippages to moderate on a sequential basis.

Yet another factor where analysts seem to differ is the magnitude of treasury losses. SBI has one of the largest bond portfolios dominated by government bonds.

Bond yields surged during the June quarter, resulting in mark-to-market losses to most banks. Considering the size of SBI’s trading book, the mark-to-market hit is expected to be sizeable.

Kotak estimates SBI’s operating profit to drop by a massive 40 percent year-on-year due to treasury losses. In fact, Kotak predicts even the net profit to drop 26 percent, contrary to most analysts who expect an increase. The firm puts SBI’s treasury loss at more than Rs 11,000 crore for the quarter.

The upshot is that SBI’s operating metrics could reflect pain from its treasury book. Investors would keenly follow the management’s outlook on loan growth and asset quality."

Sequoia-backed fintech unicorn BharatPe has roped in former SBI Cards top executive Nalin Negi as Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as part of its efforts to become profitable and list on the public markets

Negi will work towards making the company EBITDA positive by March 2023, said BharatPe in a statement on August 3. EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is a measure of profitability for companies.

Negi will also lead BharatPe through its path to an initial public offering (IPO) which the company earlier said it plans in the coming 18 to 24 months.

“The next couple of years is exciting as the company aims to hit profitability and go public and build India’s first truly Digital Bank. I am looking forward to partnering with Suhail and the leadership team at BharatPe for the next stage of growth of the company. I am hoping that we will script a great success story in BharatPe - one that will be a case study for new India,” said Negi.

Former CFO of SBI Cards, Negi led its IPO in March 2020. SBI Cards, in May, said Negi has resigned from his post as CFO. According to a regulatory filing, his last working day with the company was July 31.

In his earlier stints, Negi was associated with American Express, EXL Service India, Nestle India Limited, and ITC Limited.

As it happens, BharatPe chairman Rajnish Kumar is also from SBI, where he was chairman.

According to BharatPe, Negi will be reporting to Suhail Sameer, the company’s chief executive officer (CEO), and will be working closely with the fintech firm’s Board.

“As we focus on the next stage of growth and on building a sustainable and profitable business across both our business lines- merchant and consumer... Also, Nalin’s experience of listing SBI Card will be instrumental for us as we aim to go public in FY25,” said Sameer.

Earlier in April, Sameer told Moneycontrol in an interview, that the company had started a search for its CFO and the process might take four to five months at least. Notably, the company did not have an appointed CFO prior to this announcement.

This is the second leadership announcement for BharatPe this year. In April 2022, the company announced the appointment of Smriti Handa as the Chief Human Resources Officer."

While many private sector and some public sector banks had gone live on the AA framework, some of India’s largest PSU banks including State Bank of India (SBI), Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Indian Bank among others, were yet to onboard the platform until July. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had reportedly instructed these banks to go live on the AA framework by end of July.

The participation of major PSU banks is key to the success of AA’s framework as it will open a window for a huge pool of the banks’ customers to use the framework and allow easy access to financial services. Today, these PSU banks cater to a large chunk of India’s population.

In January, Moneycontrol reported that SBI was working on a pricing model because the bank wants to be compensated as it will be the largest information provider. The bank was also working on the infrastructure needed to manage and share the huge pool of data it possesses as the data is supposed to be accessed from its core banking system, which will require additional levels of security and audits.

What is AA framework?

The AA ecosystem facilitates sharing of financial information on a real-time basis between regulated entities. AAs are licensed by the Reserve Bank of India to enable the flow of data between Financial Information Providers (FIPs) and Financial Information Users (FIUs). The user has to give consent on what data can be shared.

The AA acts as an intermediary and the information comes from FIPs like banks, AMCs, pension funds etc, and FIUs that consume this data. FIUs, again, can be a bank giving out a loan, an insurance provider or a wealth manager, among others. FIUs and FIPs must be registered with and regulated by any of the four regulators – RBI, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI), Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA).

Companies including CAMFinServ, Perfios Account Aggregation Services, Yodlee Finsoft, NESL Asset Data, Finsec AA solutions have received approval from the RBI to operate as AAs.

Additionally, players like PhonePe, Setu, and Tally, among others have received an in-principle nod from the RBI.

In April, India’s market regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), had said that it will also join the AA framework.

Currently, all PSU banks are working with one AA each, while private sector banks are working with all AA service providers. Eventually, PSU Banks too are expected to work with all companies offering AA services to ensure that customers have the option to choose which AA's app they wish to use."

India’s biggest private lender HDFC Bank is set to become even bigger—both in terms of assets and market valuation.

After its merger with the parent, mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), the Mumbai-headquartered bank's market capitalisation will rise from Rs 7.76 trillion to around Rs 12 trillion after adding HDFC’s about Rs 4.16 trillion, according to a Moneycontrol calculation, way ahead of Rs 4.6 trillion of State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest bank.

In terms of assets, too, the difference will show.

New sheriff in town

The merger will see HDFC Bank’s assets rise to Rs 17.86 trillion, inching closer to SBI’s Rs 26.64 trillion. In another few years, HDFC Bank can emerge as a serious contender to SBI in India-focused larger loan deals, in the country and elsewhere.

SBI’s dominance is about to be challenged.

Since 1955, no bank has come closer to the state-owned lender’s massive asset size. Formerly Imperial Bank of India, which owns a fifth of the market share in assets and a quarter in loans and deposits, is the rate-trendsetter in the Rs 120-trillion Indian credit market.

But this will change after HDFC Bank’s merger with the parent.

The deal also gives HDFC Bank something it didn’t have—home loans. It has thrived on consumer loans but lacked strength in the juicy mortgage market. Its home loan book is minuscule compared with its book size.

Only 2 percent of HDFC Bank’s customers source home loans through the lender and about 70 percent of the parent’s customers do not bank with HDFC Bank. But, the merger with HDFC—the giant in the mortgage business—will address this glaring gap.

Now for some hard work

Going big on the elusive mortgage business reignites HDFC Bank’s ambition to be the market leader but it won’t be a walk in the park. Finding the synergy with the parent’s work culture—an emotional connect with clients—is the key.

To grow big, HDFC Bank needs to catch up on the liability side. It needs to add at least Rs 5.5 trillion deposits in FY24-25 to replace HDFC’s high-cost borrowings, Emkay Global’s analysts have said.

That means tough work for branches and some rate tinkering.

To dethrone SBI and lure bigger international clients, HDFC Bank will need to go big on a safe, mortgage book and let go of risky corporate and unsecured loans.

It will also need a better tech team and alert risk managers to avoid past run-ins with a watchful central bank.

For the regulator, too, bigger banks mean bigger challenges. HDFC Bank is a systemically important or a “too-big-to-fail” bank in India. The combined entity will warrant closer scrutiny by the regulator.

Recently, a clutch of banks, including State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC and ICICI Bank, sharply increased interest rates on Foreign Currency Non-Resident (Bank) or FCNR(B) deposits. The move to hike rates was in sync with the Reserve Bank of India’s efforts to boost fund inflows and support the freefalling rupee by shoring up forex reserves, which fell to a 14-month low at the end of June.

FCNR(B) deposits are essentially fixed deposits held in foreign currency. They are used by non-resident Indians, persons of Indian origin and overseas citizenship of India card holders to invest their money in India, using foreign currency, for good returns.

These deposits constitute a minuscule portion of Indian banks’ total deposits. They were equivalent to slightly over 2 percent of total savings deposits at the beginning of this financial year, at $16.14 billion (April). Total savings deposits stood at Rs 15.79 lakh crore or approximately $750 billion in March, according to the latest RBI data.

While their quantum is modest, experts believe the rise in FCNR (B) deposit rates will spark a surge in the inflow of these deposits.

Analysts, meanwhile, believe the move to raise the FCNR(B) deposit rate will affect banks' profit margins as their cost of funds may end up rising. The experts added that it is difficult to say by how much the cost would go up because there will be variations across banks, tenors and the currency of deposit.

Is bank profitability at stake?

Be it the FCNR (B) rate hike or domestic rate hikes, banks’ profit margins will only be affected in case they are not able to pass on the rate hikes to customers through lending rates and other measures as their cost of funds will also go up, say bankers.

Additionally, even if they are unable to lend, they can park excess liquidity with the RBI’s standing deposit facility (SDF) which has risen compared to its pre-pandemic level, according to economists. Under the new monetary policy, SDF helps the central bank absorb liquidity (deposits) from commercial banks without giving government securities in return to the banks.

The SDF rate is currently 25 bps below the policy repo rate of 4.90 percent, while the Marginal Standing Facility rate, or the rate at which banks obtain liquidity overnight, is 25 bps above the policy repo rate. Hence, with these rate hikes, the RBI has restored the width of the Liquidity Adjustment corridor to the pre-pandemic 50-basis-point symmetry around the policy repo rate.

With measures to pass on the rate hike through lending operations as well, banks manage to balance the impact of the hike and protect their profit margins.

“In 2013, the RBI had announced a similar FCNR deposit scheme, and after that, the RBI and banks had tried to precisely address forex risks. Now, deposit rates are going up — not only for FCNR deposits but also for local deposits — following the rate hike cycle. Credit growth is picking up and loan rates are also going up,” says Sakshi Gupta, principal economist, HDFC Bank.

If banks are able to take calculated measures in terms of lending, investments and other aspects, they can safeguard their profitability even with the rise in the FCNR(B) rate.

“It has always been seen that whenever deposit rates go up, lending margins also improve. Moreover, we have about $400 million (Rs 3,000 crore) in FCNR (B) deposits whereas the total deposits we have are more than Rs 1.8 lakh crore,” says Ashutosh Khajuria, ED, Federal Bank.

“If banks transmit the full impact of the rate hike to customers, margins will be protected. But lending rates are market driven,” explains Virat Diwanji, Group President and Head – Consumer Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank. He adds that banks offering lower rates of interest on loans are likely to attract more customers. So, passing on interest hikes through lending rates may not help them to completely balance profit margins.

But analysts and bankers expect the rate transmission to be better on the lending side as most floating loans are linked to external benchmarks. “Since external benchmarks have gone higher than other benchmarks like MCLR, banks should benefit in terms of margins in the near-term. However, deposits are also expected to reprice upward gradually, and the improvement in margins may not sustain barring changes driven by changes in product mix,” added Choksey.

Increase in demand from overseas deposits

Experts say that with higher FCNR (B) rates, overseas investors can earn a safer return compared to rupee-denominated deposits. Banks will now attract greater participation from overseas deposits.

“Currently, inflation in India is hovering around the 7% range, which is higher than the RBI’s inflation target. Inflation is expected to remain high in the coming months. When the currency depreciates because of inflation, FCNR deposits work like a hedge against it,” explains Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.com.

Naveen Kukreja, CEO and Co-founder, Paisabazaar, concurs. “As many of the advanced economies are registering steeper rate increases, higher FCNR deposit rates offered by the banks should increase the attractiveness of these deposits among NRIs. Higher inflows from NRIs would then provide some support to our forex reserves and the rupee,” he says.

Inflows are likely to go up, specifically from the US, as the yield in the US T-Bill and some other bonds offer lower returns. “Currently FCNR (B) rates vary from 2.85-3.50 percent for a one-year deposit, which is higher than the 2.8-2.9 percent yield on the 1 year US$ T-bill. The flow from overseas deposits will depend on the short-term rates in overseas markets and associated hedging costs for the banks,” said Aashay Choksey, Assistant Vice President, Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA.

Quantum of hike surprises economists

After the RBI announced its forex measures in the first week of July, some economists were expecting a rate increase of 25-30 bps. But the banks have hiked the rate by nearly 100 basis points to improve domestic FX liquidity conditions.

Banks are trying their best to be at par with the rates offered by banks in foreign countries and with the Fed rate hikes, so they have increased rates more than expected.

“FCNR is a deposit denominated in foreign currencies. In countries like the US, for deposits with a tenure of two to five years, the rate is close to 3 percent and more. The interest rate here can’t be lower than that offered in US government bonds,” said Federal Bank’s Khajuria.

Moreover, banks have taken calculated measures keeping in mind the probable rate hikes that may happen in the upcoming policy meetings, added bankers.

“Given the Fed rate hike guidance, median policy rates are expected to be 3.8 percent by December 2023, which means that the cost of raising these overseas deposits will rise further for Indian banks. Unless the hedging costs decline, or the RBI assures banks of the exchange rate in future being at competitive rates, the deposits may not be lucrative for overseas depositors,” says Choksey.

“While interest rates are rising in India, so are the interest rates in other countries. They have to think about the opportunities that are available there. There will be banks falling over each other to get more money from NRIs,” added Diwanji of Kotak Mahindra Bank.

Moreover, banks are pricing in future rate hikes as well, counting those that may happen in upcoming policy measures — it is likely that there may be a hike of 50-75 bps. “The FCNR rate was last revised long ago, pre-pandemic. It has been done this time to cover up their costs,” adds Sarbartho Mukherjee, economist, Mahindra Group.

The inflationary pressures in India are lower than in the US and some of the other advanced economies. Thus, the quantum of policy rate hikes in India should be lower than the rate hikes executed by the Federal Reserve. However, apart from the repo rates, the rate hikes by Indian banks have been determined by overall credit demand and liquidity in the Indian financial system, as well as their overall asset-liability management requirements."
"July 13, 2022 12:00 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/funds-raining-on-psu-banks-as-improving-performance-keeps-analysts-investors-bullish-8818741.html,"Through the last three-odd weeks, the PSU banking sector – a perpetual underperformer – remained largely insulated from the overall volatility roiling the markets and stayed in the positive territory, thanks to an improving investor sentiment.

The Nifty PSU Bank index is up 15 percent since June 20, led by heavy buying in leading names like Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank. The stocks climbed 20 and 24 percent in the period, while some of the other stocks from the sector have also performed relatively better. The Nifty Private Bank index – which keeps analysts gung ho – has gained merely 8 percent in comparison.

A Changing Narrative

In the last decade, public sectors banks (PSBs) have often been overlooked, and rightly so, given their inefficiency in the face of rising competition. This reflects in their share prices with the Nifty PSU Bank index down 35 percent since 2011. The Nifty Private Bank index jumped over three-fold in this period.

The 2008 market crash triggered by the global financial crisis and the following years kept the state-run lenders grappling with the series of issues. Their market share was snatched by the more aggressive private banks, non-performing assets piled up after the real estate sector crumbled, financials took a major hit with huge provisions and write-offs, and repeated scams left them gasping under bad debt burden.

This is however seems to be a turnaround time for the beleaguered state-run banks.

Most of the book cleanup is done now. High provisions coverage, which for some banks are as high as 85 percent, give them enough security to be aggressive. Provision coverage ratio (PCR) for HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are in the 70s.

“Inhone apne padosi ka bhi provision kar rakha hai (they have made provision for their neighbors too),” quipped MK Ventures founder Madhusudan Kela at TV show last week.

Also, working for them is high recovery rates in recent years, thanks to a resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, especially for loans that have been written off as they directly improve the profitability.

Mohit Nigam, Head of PMS at Hem Securities, agrees that the high PCR gives the PSU banks a sense of security. “Since public sector banks' balance sheets are now strong enough for them to focus on expansion, FY22 was a pivotal period for them,” he said, pointing at their accelerated loan and deposit growth.

Many PSBs have beaten their own projections on credit growth. The approach has been to be conservative in their guidance to account for any oversight, and grow aggressively. In FY22, Canara Bank had targeted a loan growth of 7.5 percent and closed the year at 9.77 percent. For FY23, the lender has given guidance of a minimum growth of 8 percent. “We expect to grow at 10 percent this year,” chief executive LV Prabhakar said in May.

The credit growth, however, is yet to match pace of private lenders like HDFC Bank that grows around 20 percent year-on-year. “What will drive further rerating in these banks (PSU banks) is their ability to grow,” said Nishit Master, Portfolio Manager, Axis Securities.

What also works for them, according to Nigam, is better reach, cheaper cost of funding, and a strong capital base. He also pointed out that the government has urged bankers to become more competitive and recapture market share.

Are All Animals Equal?

Not every bank among PSBs has shown the improvement like that of Canara Bank or Bank of Baroda. Some are still struggling to shake off the iron chains. Punjab National Bank, Bank of India and Central Bank of India are among those that have not shown the tenacity displayed by their peers, said analysts.

Thus, analysts have been selective in their approach, so have been investors who have largely avoided these names. “We prefer playing PSU banks through quality names like SBI and Bank of Baroda. In terms of management quality and technology, these banks are better placed than other PSU banks,” said Master.

In the near term, there are some nagging issues, but that is something which affects everyone and not just PSBs. “With an increase in interest rates, these banks will be hit by market-to-market (MTM) loss on their treasury book. But, we believe that markets will consider them as one-offs,” he said."

The court has also slapped a fine of Rs 2,000 to be deposited within four weeks.

Mallya had disbursed an amount of $ 40 million to his family members in violation of court orders. It was for this that he was held guilty of contempt of court. Today, the apex court noted that Mallya, despite being found guilty of contempt, never showed remorse, and did not apologise.

In a major step, the Supreme Court has directed for reversing these transactions to the tune of $40 million and directed for the amount along with 8% interest to be deposited within a period of four weeks.

In March this year, the apex court had reserved its order on the quantum of punishment to be given to Mallya in the contempt of court case.

Pertinently, Mallya had failed to make any submissions on the issue of quantum of punishment before the Supreme Court despite the top court's affording the chance to him.

The court had deferred hearing of the case on earlier occasions to allow time to Mallya to present his case before the court either personally or through a counsel. However, Mallya neither appeared before the court nor was his counsel able to obtain instructions from him.

The top court thus proceeded to hear the case and reserved its judgment after hearing amicus curiae at length. The apex court had appointed Senior Advocate Jaideep Gupta as the amicus curiae, that is, a friend of the court, for assistance in the case.

A last chance was yet again given to Mallya to make his case through written submissions.

The judgment today pertains to a 2017 ruling of the top court where Vijay Mallya was found to be guilty of contempt of court for willfully violating the court's orders. The conviction for contempt of court was affirmed by the Supreme Court when Mallya's plea seeking review of the ruling was also dismissed.

Mallya was directed to be present before the court for hearing on quantum of punishment, however he remained unavailable owing to the extradition proceedings that were pending against him at the time in the UK.

After the extradition proceedings were concluded, one leg of the proceedings, the nature of which was unknown to the Indian authorities were still underway in the UK."

At a case management hearing at the Chancery Division of the High Court in London on June 27, Justice Tom Leech concluded that a set of interlinked hearings in the matter would be heard together.

The case, which involves a consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) seeking the repayment of an estimated judgment debt of around GBP 1.05 billion owed by the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines, is now likely to come up in the courts next year.

The 66-year-old businessman, separately wanted in India on fraud and money laundering charges, remains on bail in the UK while a confidential legal matter believed to be related to an asylum application is resolved in connection with the unrelated extradition proceedings. Meanwhile, his lawyers have argued that the Indian banks have been pursuing the same debt against him both in India and the UK.

This week, the court was told the bankruptcy proceedings had damaged Mallya’s reputation and failed to take into account the assets already seized in India. Besides Mallya’s Bankruptcy Order Appeal and Petition Amendment Appeal, the banks in turn have appealed against parts of a May 2020 order over the security held over some of the businessman’s assets.

The Indian banks, represented by the law firm TLT LLP and barrister Marcia Shekerdemian, include State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Corporation bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co.

The hearings in the case date back to May 2018, when the banks were granted a worldwide freezing order (WFO) based on a judgment of the Bangalore Debt Recovery Tribunal.

His comments came on the heels of HDFC Bank’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD & CEO) Sashidhar Jagdishan saying in the bank’s FY22 annual report that “quite simply”, the lender could have not afforded missing the chance of the proposed merger with Housing Development Finance Corp (HDFC).

Analysts say the aggressive growth commentaries from the chiefs of two large banks show that credit demand, after hovering in single digits during the pandemic and till earlier this year, will likely pick up this fiscal. As the country’s largest private bank and public sector bank combat to gain market share, Moneycontrol analyses how the two lenders’ assets and deposits compare with each other, and whether SBI will be able to secure its age-old leadership position in the banking industry.

Assets

SBI’s loan book stood at Rs 26.64 lakh crore as on December end, up 8.5 per cent year-on-year (YoY). Retail personal loans at Rs 9.52 lakh crore as on December 31, rose 14.6 percent. Corporate loans, however, de-grew 0.7 percent to Rs 7.83 lakh crore. In a conversation with CNBC TV-18 on April 13, Khara had said that the bank will likely see more than 10 percent loan growth in the current fiscal.

Credit offtake is happening essentially in the iron, steel and cement sectors, and capital expenditure was also being seen in the automobile and e-mobility sectors, he said. Infrastructure projects are also driving credit demand in airport and port sectors, he added.

When asked whether the merger of the HDFC twins will challenge SBI’s market share in the home loan segment, Khara said the bank will be “more than happy” to rejig its products and platform to capture demand.

“I always feel that competition brings more and more agility. I think, being the largest home loan provider, that is a trigger for us to ensure that we should stay the largest ever. So, for that, whatever is required to be done, we will be more than happy… looking into our product and platform,” he said.

The combined advances of HDFC Bank and HDFC, as per an official company document seen by Moneycontrol, stand at Rs 17.86 lakh crore as on December end on proforma basis.

Analysts at ICICI Securities maintained its ‘Buy’ rating with a Rs 1,330 price target on HDFC Bank on June 23 saying the runway for the bank in terms of growth is huge and it can add one HDFC Bank every five years.

“The CEO’s message is similar to what was articulated during the analyst day on 31 May 2022 highlighting why this is an opportune time to fructify the merger given housing loan growth opportunity with deeper penetration, regulatory convergence, conducive market development, pricing convergence, portfolio rebalancing, enhanced cross-sell,” it said.

While SBI will continue its focus expanding its digital footprint across country, HDFC Bank plans to open between 1,500 and 2,000 branches each year for the next three to five years, as per Jagdishan.

“The branch will be digital from a customer on-boarding and transaction/servicing perspective. It will provide the emotional connect and relationship management necessary for offering financial solutions to our customers. These branches will be small in size and will be phygital relationship centres,” Jagdishan said.

“This will enable us to go after the catchment more aggressively and build the required liability franchise that we are known for, and we are confident that we would execute well,” he added.

As on March end, HDFC Bank’s total banking outlets stood at 21,683, while total branches, including four overseas, stood at 6,342. The lender’s total ATMs and cash deposit machines were at 18,130 at the end of March, and it had 15,341 business correspondents (BCs) in its network.

Further, as only 2 per cent of HDFC Bank customers source their home loans through the bank, the scope for rise in mortgage loans is immense, the MD said.

“Home loan customers typically keep deposits that are five to seven times that of other retail customers. And about 70 percent of HDFC Ltd’s customers do not bank with us. All these gives us an idea about the size of the opportunity,” he added.

HDFC Bank has a home loan agreement with HDFC, according to which HDFC Bank sources loans for the parent for a 1.10 percent fee, with the right to buy 70 percent of the loans it originates. Due to the agreement, HDFC Bank could only source home loans from 2,000 of the over 6,500 branches it had as on March end, an HDFC source said.

Liabilities, asset quality

On the liabilities side, SBI’s total deposits stood at Rs 38.47 lakh crore as on December-end, while HDFC Bank’s total deposits stood at Rs 16.01 lakh crore on a proforma basis.

The low-cost current account, savings account (CASA) deposits for SBI stood at Rs 17 lakh crore as on December-end, while HDFC Bank had total CASA deposits of Rs 6.81 lakh crore on a standalone basis in same period.

Further, SBI’s net interest margin (NIM) stood at 3.40 per cent as on December end, while HDFC Bank’s core NIM stood at 4.1 per cent.

“Overall, factoring in the regulatory requirements (CRR+SLR+PSL) and assuming that 20 percent of high-cost HDFC borrowings are replaced, our workings suggest that the bank will have to mobilise deposits to the tune of Rs 5.5 trillion over FY24-25, which need to be met through a combination of growing vintage of branches and accelerated growth via some rate tinkering,” brokerage Emkay Global said in a report dated May 23.

“However, the deposit ask can be reduced by slowing down HDFC’s growth, increasing affordable housing/PSL-compliant loan growth, phased grandfathering of HDFC’s bank borrowings, and even raising relatively cheap overseas bonds,” it added.

In terms of asset quality, SBI’s headline numbers were higher than HDFC Bank.

While SBI’s gross and net non-performing asset (GNPA, NNPA) ratio stood at 4.50 per cent and 1.34 per cent as on December end, respectively, HDFC Bank’s corresponding numbers stood at 1.26 per cent and 0.37 per cent for the same period."

The Centre's Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) will collaborate with the State Bank of India (SBI) to create an integrated pension portal to enhance ease of living of pensioners, according to an official statement on Tuesday.

Sessions on pension policy reforms and digitisation regarding the disbursement of pensions to central government pensioners were organised with the objective of updating SBI field functionaries during the two-day bankers' awareness programme in Udaipur, Rajasthan.

Special sessions were organised on income tax matters related to pensioners as well as digital means of submitting annual life certificates, said the statement by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. It was decided that immediate efforts are needed for the creation of an integrated pension portal by linking the existing portals of the DoPPW and the SBI to provide seamless services to pensioners, it said.

Face authentication technology for digital life certificate may be advertised extensively by banks, the statement said. Digital life certificate and face authentication technology would be a game changer for pensioners and banks in the submission of life certificates, it said.

It is expected that through these programmes, the objective of enhancing ease of living' of pensioners will be achieved to a great extent, the statement said. Four such awareness programmes will be conducted in collaboration with the State Bank of India to cover the whole country, it said.

Awareness programmes on similar lines will be conducted in collaboration with other pension disbursing banks in 2022-23, the statement said."

State Bank of India chairman Dinesh Khara on Friday said the improvement in capacity utilisation to 74 per cent from 69 per cent shows that the economy is geared for its natural growth. He said among the large nations across the globe, India is one of the most stable economies in the current situation.

""The way the capacity utilisation in the economy has improved from 69 per cent to 74 per cent, and is inching upwards, it is a clear sign that the economy is poised for its natural growth,"" Khara said at a banking event organised at the Financial Express newspaper. He said the country has handled the pandemic in the best possible manner and the economy is performing pretty well.

Talking about the credit demand, Khara said retail and corporate sectors are both witnessing the momentum. ""I would say it (credit demand) is universal. Our retail book continues to grow at more than 16 per cent per annum. This has been the trend for more than 4-5 years.

""On the corporate side, there was a time when corporates were raising money from the market also but now gradually they are moving towards banks for availing CP (Commercial Paper) funding. So that also is a new engine of growth,"" Khara said. Speaking at the event, Standard Chartered CEO Zarin Daruwala said over the last four-five months, there has been an increase in demand for working capital loans owing to a surge in commodity prices.

There is demand for loans from the MSME segment after the government launched the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), he said."

The Reserve Bank is much ahead of the curve in containing inflation, which appeared to have peaked, though it may go for an interest rate hike in August and October, according to an SBI research report. After rising to a 95-month (almost 8 years) high of 7.79 per cent in April, Consumer Price Index (CPI) based inflation moderated to 7.04 per cent in May.

Core CPI also moderated in May to 6.09 per cent compared to 6.97 per cent in April, as per the SBI's research report 'Ecowrap'. ""In recent times, there have been commentaries that have questioned whether RBI has been behind the curve in controlling inflation.

""We believe RBI is much ahead of the curve in controlling inflation and the Fed can borrow a template from RBI to control US inflation that is all-pervasive and threatens to rip apart global financial stability,"" it said. The report has been authored by Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, State Bank of India.

The report further said there are expectations that the RBI could factor in a rate hike in August (as inflation in June is likely to come above 7 per cent) and even in October policy, and take it higher than the pre-pandemic level by October to 5.5 per cent. ""Our peak rate at the end of the cycle now has now a higher probability of a lower bound of 5.5 per cent and a lower probability of going up to 5.75 per cent, depending on inflation trajectory,"" the report said.

It, however, added that this is purely data-dependent and subject to revisions. The RBI raised the short-term lending rate by 40 basis points in May and 50 basis points in June, taking the repo rate to 4.9 per cent to tame stubbornly high inflation.

""Our average inflation forecast for 2022-23 is 6.7 per cent but our quarterly inflation numbers are slightly different from RBI. ""The best thing is that the peak of inflation may have been reached at 7.8 per cent, with a little bit of luck,"" it added.

Earlier this month, the RBI revised upwards its inflation projection to 6.7 per cent for the current fiscal from its previous forecast of 5.7 per cent. The central bank expects the first quarter inflation at 7.5 per cent; the second quarter at 7.4 per cent; the third quarter at 6.2 per cent; and the fourth quarter at 5.8 per cent, with risks, evenly balanced."

While that title holds good in India as well, some bankers, it appears, are richer — way, way richer — than others.

Dinesh Khara would be able to testify to that.

Khara heads India’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI). He is a powerful man, overseeing assets to the tune of Rs 28.18 lakh crore and loan disbursals of over Rs 50,000 crore in a year. But Khara, who earned an annual salary of Rs 34 lakh in FY22, may not be laughing all the way to the bank. While Rs 34 lakh is a decent pay package for a government-run entity, it pales in comparison with the compensation earned by Khara’s private-sector counterparts in the business of lending. For instance, HDFC Managing Director and CEO Keki Mistry took home a gross package of Rs 19 crore in the financial year 2022. HDFC’s total assets under management (AUM) stood at Rs 6.53 crore as on March-end.

Private bank chiefs

The salaries of the top five private bank leaders, excluding ICICI Bank, ranged between 2.3 crore to Rs 7.1 crore per annum, including perks, in FY21. Private banks are yet to release their FY22 annual report. This story has used the latest numbers where available. Other numbers will be updated as they become available.

The stark difference in the annual salaries of public and private sector bank executives is due to private banks’ performance incentives being attached to their annual remuneration.

The widening divide in salary between top officials in public sector banks (PSBs) and their counterparts in private sector banks and large non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) continues to highlight the wage problem in India’s state-owned banks.

A private bank chief’s salary will be dependent on multiple factors, such as the performance of the bank, including net profit, the performance of subsidiaries, and dividends, among others. The private bank heads also have equity stock ownership plan (ESOP) perks, which are not available in PSU banks.

For example, HDFC Bank granted former MD Aditya Puri a total quantum of 406,140 employee stock options for the performance year 2019-20, basis of approval by the RBI. HDFC Bank Executive Director Kaizad Bharucha was granted a total quantum of 153,300 employee stock options for the performance year 2019-20, while Sashidhar Jagdishan, who took over as HDFC Bank MD and CEO from October 27, 2020, received a total of 260,000 employee stock options.

“The quantum of grant reported for him (Jagdishan) pertains to the grant received in his erstwhile role of Group Head of the Bank during the financial year 2020-21, prior to his appointment as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,” HDFC Bank’s FY21 annual report said.

Axis Bank MD & CEO Amitabh Chaudhry received a basic salary of over Rs 3.8 crore in FY21, leave fare concession facility of Rs 10 lakh, house rent allowance of Rs 1.07 crore, and perquisites, excluding ESOPs, of Rs 84 lakh, among others.

“Amitabh Chaudhry was granted 16,55,000 stock options, under the Employee Stock Option Scheme of the Bank, since 1 January 2019 being the date of his appointment as the Managing Director & CEO of the Bank….Further, 8,64,500 stock options remain unvested, as on 31 March 2021,” said Axis Bank’s annual report.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, on the other hand, paid Rs 1.8 crore to its Joint MD Dipak Gupta in FY21 with another Rs 1.5 crore as an annual incentive.

“For Mr Uday Kotak and Mr Dipak Gupta, the Annual Incentive includes an amount of ` 8,500,000 for FY 2018-19, approved by the RBI on 6th July 2020 and 7,000,000 for FY 2019-20, as approved by RBI on 26th March 2021,” the bank said.

IndusInd Bank MD & CEO Sumant Kathpalia earned Rs 1.6 crore in annual salary in FY21 and received other allowances amounting to Rs 5.4 crore.

Apart from HDFC, PSU bank heads also earn less than the chiefs of prominent NBFCs such as Bajaj Finance and Mahindra & Mahindra Finance, who paid their leaders over Rs 3.8 crore and over Rs 9 crore, respectively, in remuneration last fiscal year, excluding ESOP grants.

Size doesn't matter

Khara’s remuneration is lower than the Rs 40 lakh that his peer, Bank of Baroda MD & CEO Sanjiv Chadha, earned in the same period, the banks’ annual reports showed. For FY22, Chadha earned Rs 38.19 lakh as annual salary and Rs 2,27,191 in perquisites, while Khara earned Rs 27 lakh in basic pay and Rs 742,500 as dearness allowance.

On a consolidated basis, the salary of the top 5 PSU public sector bank leaders in FY22, excluding Punjab National Bank (PNB), ranged between Rs 34 lakh and Rs 40 lakh.

The salary of whole-time directors (WTD) of PSU banks and other senior officials has to be based on composite performance parameters of the individual and bank, a senior private sector bank official told Moneycontrol.

As per the RBI’s report on trends and progress of banking in India, released on December 28, the gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio of all scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) moderated to its lowest level in six years, aided by efforts towards recoveries and technical write-offs.

As of September end, the GNPAs of scheduled commercial banks fell to 6.9 percent from 7.3 percent as on March 31, 2021. Private banks’ GNPAs fell from 5.5 percent in FY20 to 4.9 percent in FY21, while PSU banks’ GNPAs reduced to 9.1 percent in FY21 versus 10.3 percent a year ago.

“Asset quality improved, partly attributable to imposition of the asset classification standstill. Public sector banks (PSBs) reported net profits after a gap of five years. More generally, the capital position of banks improved, aided by recapitalisation by the government as well as raising of funds from the market,” the RBI said.

Apart from most PSBs posting profits in FY22 on an individual basis, SBI’s standalone net profit rose 55% in FY22 over the previous year to Rs 31,676 crore, on the back of stable net interest income and controlled slippages.

“During FY22, your Bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPA) came down by Rs 14,366 crore to Rs 1,12,023 crore. Recoveries and upgradation during the year increased by 21.58% to Rs 21,437 crore. Consequently, the gross NPA ratio of the Bank improved by 101 bps from 4.98% in March 2021. The net NPA of the Bank also improved to 1.02% as of March 2022,” SBI’s annual report said.

“The talent crunch (at PSU banks) can be solved if the Board is also permitted to recruit wholetime directors (WTDs) from the market. Today, these are selected only from public sector banks,” the official said.

“The RBI has issued detailed guidelines for computation of the compensation for wholetime directors of private sector Banks, which include the fixed and variable portion of the compensation. The variable portion also includes ESOPs and cash incentives and the same guidelines should be made applicable for the compensation of WTDs of PSBs too,” the official added.

A senior union leader, however, had a different view on the subject.

“Private banks’ motive is to make a profit, while PSBs’ objective is broad-based economic development and making banking credit and services accessible to all, at affordable prices,” said CH Venkatachalam, General Secretary, All India Bank Employees Association.

There is more security in a PSU bank role but the need for a pay hike is being felt of late as the top job has become stressful now, especially in the face of heightened competition, he added.

Consumer cutbacks due to raging inflation and higher borrowing costs are failing to dent investment plans at Indian businesses tapping the country’s biggest lender, a sign that a recovery in Asia’s third-largest economy is gathering pace.

Companies are steadily drawing down from a $71 billion loan pipeline, Dinesh Kumar Khara, chairman of State Bank of India, told Bloomberg News in an interview at his Mumbai office. Loan growth at the 216-year-old lender, a banker to one out of every three Indians, is expected to be robust, underpinned by demand from businesses after two straight years of credit contraction, Khara said.

That broadly mirrors a trend where loan growth in India’s Rs 120 trillion ($1.5 trillion) banking system is expanding annually at its fastest pace in three years. While part of the credit demand is to cover rising costs, the rest is going into business expansion and investments for capacity addition.

“Whether it is working capital loans or term loans, the draw downs have been rising, and the ratio of pipeline to loan book narrowed by at least six percentage points in recent months,” Khara said. “Capacity utilization at several sectors like iron and steel is full, and if we get a good monsoon too this year, things will get way better.”

The rise in business confidence and credit demand in India comes despite rising cost of funds. On Wednesday, the central bank’s rate-setting panel raised the key interest rate for a second straight month to tame inflationary pressures with policymakers pledging to withdraw the pandemic-era monetary stimulus in coming months.

The rising demand for loans means SBI will have to shore up its capital adequacy ratio, since it is hovering at less than two percentage points over the minimum regulatory requirement. The bank’s overall capital buffer of 13.8% is the lowest among the top lenders in the country.

Funding Growth

SBI will be aiming to sell bonds to augment its capital base, Khara said. The lender sold so-called Tier 1 bonds, which can be fully written down in a crisis, in December at the lowest coupon among Indian banks after the country started implementing the stringent Basel III capital rules in 2013.

With Khara at the helm over the last 21 months, SBI shares have surged about 150%, making it the best performer on the 10-member BSE Bankex index for the period. The 61-year-old banker, the son of a Reserve Bank of India official, started working at the lender in 1984 and made his way to up become chairman in October 2020.

A challenge for Khara is the drop in investment profits at the lender as rallying yields erode prices of debt holdings. SBI held government securities -- including federal and state securities -- worth about 7 trillion rupees as of March 31, exchange filings show.

The higher returns on certain debt securities, including those of state governments, will soften the blow to the bank’s treasury earning, Khara said. As a portion of the overall assets, the debt securities holdings will also decrease as the credit growth outpace deposits.

A customer talks on his phone as he exits a State Bank of India (SBI) branch in Patna, Bihar, India, on Friday, Feb. 26, 2021. After falling into a coronavirus-fueled recession in the third quarter, India's economy has likely returned to expansion in the three months ended December, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists."

Private sector lender YES Bank on June 8 said its Board of Directors, appointed under the YES Bank Reconstruction Scheme of March 2020, has recommended the formation of a new board, in line with the directions of the Scheme, to shareholders.

The Board has also recommended that Prashant Kumar continue as the bank’s chief for another three years and will seek investors’ nod for the same, the lender said in an exchange filing today.

The existing Board of the Bank consists of four Directors: Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Prashant Kumar, Board Chairman Sunil Mehta and Board Members Mahesh Krishnamurti and Atul Bheda. Two SBI nominee directors and two RBI appointed Additional Directors also sit on the YES Bank Board.

As per the Reconstruction Scheme, members of the Board, other than the Additional Directors appointed by the RBI, shall continue in office for one year, or until an alternative Board is constituted.

YES Bank reported its first full year profit in FY22 at Rs 1,066 crore after two successive years of heavy losses in FY20 and FY21.

Accordingly, basis the recommendation of State Bank of India (SBI), the largest shareholder, the YES Bank Board said it has initiated the process of appointing a new Board. SBI is in favour of Kumar continuing as MD and CEO for three years, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, the lender added.

In an interview with Moneycontrol on May 3, Kumar said the bank will be able to show not only good growth on the business side, but also continued, sustained profitability.

Further, SBI has also recommended the names of nine bank officials for YES Bank’s new board. They are: Arul Malik, Rekha Murthy, Sharad Sharma, Nandita Gurjar, Sanjay Kumar Khemani, Sadashiv Rao, T. Keshav Kumar, Sandeep Tewari and Prashant Kumar.

State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Dinesh Khara earned Rs 34.42 lakh rupees in annual salary for the financial year ending 2021-22 (FY22), 13.4% higher than what his predecessor Rajnish Kumar drew during FY21, as per the bank's FY22 annual report.

Khara joined SBI as a probationary officer in 1984 and took over as the bank Chairman in October 2020. He previously served as MD of the bank in charge of global banking and SBI subsidiaries, among others.

Former SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar received a total of Rs 30.34 lakh from the bank of which Rs 14.04 lakh was in form of leave encashment paid on retirement in October 2020.

For FY22, SBI Chairman Khara earned Rs 27 lakh in basic pay and Rs 742,500 as dearness allowance. Of the total Rs 38.12 lakh SBI Chairman earned in FY21, Rs 400,000 were in form of incentives.

In comparison, Canara Bank MD and Chief Executive Officer (MD & CEO) LV Prabhakar drew Rs 36.89 lakh annual salary in FY22, while Bank of Baroda paid a remuneration of Rs 40.46 lakh to its MD & CEO Sanjiv Chadha during the same period.

SBI engaged an external consulting company in FY22 which assisted the bank in laying down parameters for performance evaluation of Directors, Chairman, Board Level Committees, and Central Board as a whole and also assisted in facilitating the overall evaluation process, the report said.

“The evaluation process has validated the Board of Directors’ confidence in the governance values of the Bank, the synergy that exists amongst the Board of Directors, and the collaboration between the Chairman, the Board, and the Management,” it added.

In accordance with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Central government directions in 2019, SBI has formed a nomination and remuneration committee (NRC) led by Chairman B Venugopal to conduct due diligence and arrive at the ‘fit and proper’ status of candidates filing nominations for election as Directors by shareholders, the annual report said, adding that during FY 2022, the NRC met once.

Further, SBI offers compensation of Rs 70,000 as ‘sitting fees’ for the Non-Executive Director attending the Meetings of the Central Board and Rs 30,000 for attending the meetings of other Board level Committees.

Private banks

The annual compensation granted by the central government to public sector banks is significantly lower compared to how much private bank leaders make in a year.

For example, during FY21, HDFC Bank MD & CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan drew Rs 4.77 crore in annual salary, while Axis Bank MD Amitabh Chaudhry drew upwards of Rs 6 crore during the same period.

ICICI Bank MD & CEO Sandeep Bakhshi voluntarily relinquished his fixed compensation of basic, supplementary allowances and retirals for fiscal 2021 in view of COVID-19 related impact on the bank and was paid an honorarium fee of Re 1.

The pay gap between private and public sector banks' heads has been a long-standing issue that needs a solution in order to attract top talent, bankers said. The salary of a private bank leadership team is competitive due to better employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs).

“The respective banks’ boards must be authorised to decide compensation based on composite performance parameters of the individual and the Bank,” a senior banker with a private sector bank said.

“The talent crunch can be solved if the Board is also permitted to recruit Whole time directors from the market. Today these are selected only from public sector banks,” they add."

In the face of the heightened inflation situation – the headline number touched nearly 7.8 per cent for April, and the RBI is set to hike rates by another 0.75 per cent to get the repo rate back to the pre-pandemic level of 5.15 per cent, they added.

The economists said they did a study of the Russian invasion's impact on inflation, which revealed that 59 per cent of the jump in prices is due to geopolitical events.

Using February as the base case, the study revealed that because of war alone, food and beverages, fuel, light and transport contributed 52 per cent of the increase, while another 7 per cent impact came from the jump in input prices for the FMCG sector.

Stating that the inflation is unlikely to correct anytime soon, the note said there is a difference between rural and urban areas when it comes to price rises. The former are impacted more by higher food price pressures, while the latter are showing more impact because of the fuel price hikes.

""Against the continued increase in inflation, it is now almost certain that RBI will raise rates in forthcoming June and August policy and will take it to the pre-pandemic level of 5.15 per cent by August,"" it said, adding that the biggest question for the central bank to ponder is whether inflation will tread down meaningfully because of such rate hikes if war-related disruptions do not subside quickly.

It also needs to check if growth could be a large casualty in case of large and persistent rate increases, even as inflation prints will continue to be of serious concern, the note added.

Backing the RBI in its moves to quell inflation by rate hikes, the economists said there can also be a positive impact of the hikes.

The country's largest lender State Bank of India has raised its marginal cost of funds based lending rate by 10 basis points or 0.1 per cent across all tenures, a move that will lead to an increase in EMIs for borrowers. This is the second hike in a month raising the cost by 0.2 per cent with the two consecutive increases.

The revision follows an off-cycle rate increase by the Reserve Bank earlier this month. The central bank hiked the repo rate -- at which it lends short term money to banks -- by 0.40 per cent to 4.40 per cent. The lending rate revision by SBI (State Bank of India) is likely to be followed by other banks in the days to come.

With the increase, EMIs will go up for those borrowers who have availed loans on MCLR (Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate), not for those, whose loans are linked to other benchmarks. SBI's External Benchmark based Lending Rate (EBLR) is 6.65 per cent, while the Repo-Linked Lending Rate (RLLR) is 6.25 per cent effective April 1.

Banks add Credit Risk Premium (CRP) over the EBLR and RLLR while giving any kind of loan, including housing and auto loans. The revised MCLR rate is effective from May 15, as per the information posted on SBI website.

With the revision, one-year MCLR has increased to 7.20 per cent from 7.10 per cent earlier. An overnight, one-month and three-month MCLR rose by 10 basis points to 6.85 per cent, whereas a six-month MCLR increased to 7.15 per cent.

Most of the loans are linked to the one-year MCLR rate. At the same time, two-year MCLR increased by 0.1 per cent to 7.40 per cent, while three-year MCLR rose to 7.50 per cent.

Following the rate revision by RBI, several banks have already raised interest rates and some more are expected to follow in the coming days."

In an interaction on May 13, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara spoke about how the country's largest lender perceives potential interest rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and loan growth and asset quality going forward.

SBI reported a 41 percent surge in net profit for January-March to Rs 9,114 crore on a yearly basis due to decline in bad loans. The bank said that provisions for bad loans came down to nearly a third of the year ago level. Over the quarters, like most lenders, SBI has focused on building a safe retail loan book to protect the quality of its assets during the pandemic. Its non-performing asset ratios have also improved in recent quarters.

In the interview below, Khara speaks about the bank being in a position to achieve the target of 15 percent return on equity before 2024.

Edited excerpts:

What is the outlook on net interest margin?

About 75 percent of the book is linked to either MCLR (marginal cost of fund-based lending rate) or EBLR (external benchmark lending rate) or treasury bill. In such a scenario, when the interest rates are on the rise, we have the advantage because the loans are getting repriced from time to time, but when it comes to deposits, they always go up with a lag. So, I think I expect that it should have a positive impact going forward as far as the NIMs (net interest margin) of the bank are concerned.

Considering that a large part of the banking system loan is repo-linked, do you feel that there will be more pressure on the retail segment given that the rate cycle is turning?

When it comes to personal loans, the yardstick for us is the EMI (equated monthly instalment) to NMI (net monthly income) ratio. Suppose the interest rates go up, and the salaries are also likely to be pre-COVID level: In such a situation, the EMI-to-NMI ratio is going to the advantage of the customer.

How concerning is inflation right now?

I think for an economy like ours, which is actually a developing economy, inflation is positive to some extent. Because in these inflationary conditions, if you leverage, it is to the advantage of the customer, both corporate and retail.

Optically when the repo rate goes up 40 basis points, it gives an impression that probably it's a shock. But when you look into the overall context, it may not be.

Your return on equity (RoE) is currently 13.92 percent. By when will your target of 15 percent be met?

We had set a target by the year 2024. Currently, we have witnessed about 398 basis point improvement in a year. That gives us the confidence that we should achieve the aim much before the targeted date.

What is your guidance on loan growth?

Normally, we don't give any kind of future scenario outlook. But nevertheless, with the kind of trend I have seen till now in the current year, we are seeing that our loan book is growing faster than deposits. So I think that is something which gives me confidence that we should continue to see the kind of loan growth that you've seen in the past, both in retail as well as the corporate side.

Can you give us some details of where the corporate loan growth is coming from?

As far as the corporate loan book is concerned, most of the growth is related to infrastructure which is not reflected till now. We have also got an un-utilised working facility, which is about Rs 2 lakh crore. There is about Rs 4.60 lakh crore worth of proposals in the corporate space. We strongly believe that corporate credit growth will have a good climate.

How will corporate loans be priced?

The pricing is also a function of the liquidity in the system. So the recent attempt of RBI to increase the repo also means it will be sucking out about Rs 87,000 crore excess liquidity. So I think, as the liquidity gets rebalanced in the system, perhaps the pressure on the loan for the banks may not be as high. So I think perhaps it will lead to some kind of a readjustment in terms of pricing. The corporate loans will be rightly priced.

How do you expect retail loan demand to pan out in the current scenario?

The willingness of the retail borrowers will depend upon their NMI. If at all, they have felt the need for a house, they will certainly go for the mortgage, or for that matter, any personal loan. We are not seeing a demand issue.

Do you foresee any issue on re-payment of existing loans?

In terms of payment of existing loans, I don't think we have any concern. Obviously, we'll have to wait and watch what kind of investments will happen as we go forward if the lower rate of interest obviously has driven the home sales, right? So I think it's appropriate to wait for a couple of quarters and see how it plays out.

Any consideration on increasing the savings account interest rate?

The ALCO (assets and liabilities committee) is yet to decide on this.

How much is the restructured book?

I think as far as our restructured book is concerned it is about Rs 30,000 crore which is actually less than 1.1 percent of our total loan book. Even for that we have adequate provisions. In fact, I would like to mention that in our provisions you will see a number which is almost about Rs 7,900 crore, which was earlier the COVID-related provision. Now we have kept this provision for the restructured book.

Any signs of stress in the restructured book?

The restructured book is behaving pretty well. We have seen a situation where people have started repaying.

Does that mean you will stick to your guidance of keeping slippages below two percent of the total book?

We should be in a position to maintain that. Slippages will be in check.

Stress in agriculture loans continues to remain slightly elevated. Why is that?

Part of it is also attributed to the macroeconomy and most of it to the rural stress. Hopefully with better monsoons this year, we should see an improvement in the recovery climate.

It appears you are bullish on co-lending in the agriculture sector…

We are getting into the co-lending kind of an arrangement in the agriculture and SME space (small and medium enterprises). We have seen that co-lending partners have got much better experience in terms of the quality of the book, and we will be riding on that. We expect that our agri portfolio should also improve.

What is the update on the National Asset Reconstruction Company? By when will it start taking bad assets?

We expect that it should happen soon.

We understand that there were some vacancies to be filled in the company.

They have already been filled. Some of them will require regulatory approval before being onboarded. Those are expected to come in the next few weeks.

What is your exposure to Future Group and Srei Group?

I normally don't discuss any account in particular, but I will just say that both these accounts are fully provided for in the books.

Any plans to upgrade YONO?

A request for proposal has been floated. The teams are already working on it.

Is there a plan to make YONO a digital bank?

We have no such plan. We will rather like to build the muscle in the bank, and create value for all our stakeholders, including customers.

Any plans to monetise your subsidiaries?

We have to be very mindful of market realities. We have nurtured the subsidiaries well, and would like to take them to the market route at the appropriate time.

Has there been any impact on your overseas exposure because of the Russia-Ukraine crisis?

As far as our international operations are concerned, our presence in Russia is through a subsidiary. But it's a very small amount as compared to our overseas balance sheet. I don't think it will have any impact as far as our international operations are concerned.

What is your exposure to Sri Lanka?

Whatever exposure we have to Sri Lanka, it is all guaranteed by the government of India.

There was a recent loan offer SBI gave its employees for the LIC IPO. What kind of traction have you seen there?

I think the numbers are still to be compiled. But I think broadly, whoever wanted the loan got it. I think it is also important that employees had adequate funding."

A clerical error from a State Bank of India employee led to Rs 1.50 crore being transferred to the wrong beneficiaries. According to a report in The Hindu, the unnamed SBI employee’s copy-paste mistake saw funds for the Dalit Bandhu scheme being accidentally deposited into the accounts of 15 employees of Lotus Hospitals.

Each Lotus Hospitals employee received Rs 10 lakh in their salary account. The funds were meant for the Telangana government’s Dalit Bandhu welfare scheme.

The Saifabad police in Hyderabad said that an employee of the SBI Rangareddy District Collectorate branch accidentally transferred Rs 1.50 crore to the wrong accounts on April 24.

Of the 15 people who received Rs 10 lakh in their accounts, 14 returned the money while one person, a lab technician named Mahesh, failed to send it back.

“Soon after realising the mistake, the bank officials called the employees and asked them to transfer back the amount. While 14 employees reverted the money, lab technician Mahesh failed to send back the money, as he was not available over phone,” a senior official was quoted as saying by The Hindu.

Mahesh wrongly assumed that Rs 10 lakh had been deposited in his account under some government scheme and used some of the money to clear previous debts. “Despite repeated requests, he was not returning the money. As a result, on Wednesday, the bank official lodged a complaint, and a case under Section 403 of IPC was registered against Mahesh,” the officer said.

Ironically, while Saifabad police registered a case against the accidental beneficiary, no case was registered against the SBI employee whose mistake led to the whole confusion.

Mahesh has returned Rs 6.70 lakh but still owes the bank Rs 3.30 lakh.

“A copy-paste error by the bank employee has led to such a big fuss,” the officer added."

State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, is planning to ramp up its co-lending business, said Chairman Dinesh Khara on May 13. The bank will enter into co-lending partnerships for loans to agriculture and small and medium enterprises and aims to bring down slippages in these sectors, Khara said.

“We are getting into the co-lending kind of an arrangement (for agriculture and SME), Dinesh Khara told reporters at a press conference post-January-March results. “We have seen that co-lending partners have got more experience in terms of the quality of the book. We will be riding on that.”

Co-lending refers to partnerships between two lenders, typically a bank and a non-bank, to offer loans to the economically weaker sections or borrowers under the so-called priority sector lending (PSL) programme. Banks are embracing co-lending to scale up business and tap credit growth.

With expected better monsoons this year, slippages in the agriculture sector should come down eventually, Khara said.

The bank’s restructuring book, which is 1.1 percent of the total book, is also behaving well, Khara said. SBI is “not expecting any surprises” from non-performing assets.

In terms of the bank’s margins, the gradual rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India will have a positive impact, the chairman said.

“We have got the advantage because loans are getting repriced, but deposits, they go up with a lag, Khara said. “I expect that it should have a positive impact on the margins of the bank going forward, he added.

SBI also aims to maintain the current credit growth even in the next financial year, Khara said. The bank had reported a credit growth of 11.6 percent on-year in the Jan-March quarter and has a visibility of corporate loans worth Rs 4.6 lakh crore, Khara said.

The bank also has no plans to make YONO, it mobile banking application, into a digital entity.

“We would rather like to build the muscle in the bank and create value for all our stakeholders, including customers and stakeholders,” Khara said.

SBI will be also mindful of market realities before monetising stake in its subsidiaries, Khara said, adding that it will take it to the market at the right time.

Khara also said the National Asset Reconstruction Company will start taking bad assets “soon.”

To supplement this, Managing Director Swaminathan J said that the process of identification of bad accounts and due diligence is almost done.

“It is in the final stage of getting all approvals ready in terms of making binding offers to banks. We are probably a couple of weeks away from that,” Swaminathan said.

SBI Q4 Result

SBI reported a 41 percent year-on-year rise in net profit at Rs 9,113.5 crore for the quarter ended March 2022, which was below Street's estimate of Rs 9,927.6 crore.

SBI's net profit for Q4FY22 was its highest ever but it still underwhelmed the Street as expectations were on the higher side. The bank's shares slipped a little over 1 percent in response to the quarterly results.

The net profit growth was on the back of a 15.3 percent growth in net interest income which stood at Rs 31,198 crore. This too was lower marginally versus analysts' expectations of Rs 31,570 crore.

Non-interest income disappointed, slipping 27 percent year-on-year. But on a sequential basis, non-interest income jumped 37 percent while NII growth was a mere 1.6 percent."

Country’s largest lender State Bank of India on Tuesday announced a hike of 40-90 basis points in the interest rates on several bulk term deposits.

The revised interest rates on bulk term deposits amounting to Rs 2 crore and above are effective from Tuesday, the bank said.

While interest rate on deposits maturing between 7 days and 45 days has been kept unchanged at 3 per cent, those maturing between 46 and 179 days will now attract an interest rate of 3.50 per cent as against 3 per cent earlier.

The public sector lender also revised interest rate on bulk term deposits maturing between 180 and 210 days by 40 basis points to 3.50 per cent, as against 3.10 per cent earlier, as per the bank’s website.

Deposits maturing between 211 days and less than 1 year will earn an interest of 3.75 per cent, up 45 bps from 3.30 per cent.

The interest rate on bulk deposits having maturities between 1 year and less than two years has been increased by 40 bps to 4 per cent.

For deposits having 2 years to less than 3 years maturity period, the rate has been hiked by 65 bps to 4.25 per cent.

The interest rate on bulk term deposits for 3 years and up to 10 years has been increased by 90 basis points to 4.50 per cent as against 3.60 per cent.

Last week, Punjab National Bank said had increased interest rates on term deposits in selected buckets up to 60 basis points from May 7.

The new fixed deposit rates are applicable on deposits up to Rs 10 crore, PNB said.

The hike in deposit rates by the banks came after a surprise 40 basis points increase in repo rate to 4.40 per cent on May 4 by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

A hike in repo rate by RBI gives banks scope to increase their deposit rates, which in turn provides depositors an opportunity to earn higher interest on their funds parked with banks.

On Monday several banks, including HDFC Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of Maharashtra and Karur Vysya Bank, revised their lending rates based on marginal cost of funds and repo rate.

Meanwhile, Bajaj Finance, the lending and investing arm of Bajaj Finserv, on Tuesday said it has increased the interest rates on fixed deposits by up to 10 basis points for tenor between 36 and 60 months.

The revised rates on FDs (fixed deposits) of up to Rs 5 crore are effective from May 10, 2022, and shall be applicable to fresh deposits and renewals of maturing deposits, the company said in a release.

Post the revision, deposits for the period of 36 months to 60 months will offer a cumulative return as high as 7 per cent.

Senior citizens can reap the benefit of up to 0.25 per cent higher FD rates, which will offer assured returns of 7.45 per cent for 44 months, the release said."

Last week, the HC had pulled up the country’s largest public sector lender for not issuing a no-dues certificate, observing this was nothing but harassment.

On Monday, the bank, in an affidavit filed before the court of Justice Bhargav Karia, said it has issued the no-dues certificate on April 28 to the borrower, required for clearing the land deal.

Justice Karia said in his order that with the issuance of the no-dues certificate, the petitioner has sought permission to withdraw the plea.

The SBI said it could not issue the no-dues certificate earlier in view of a letter received from the original borrower directing it not to do so.

""It was not the endeavour of the respondent bank to not issue no-dues certificate in spite of payment of the entire dues,” the SBI told the court.

The court had last Wednesday pulled up the bank for not issuing no-dues certificate over an outstanding amount of just 31 paise.

Petitioners Rakesh Verma and Manoj Verma had purchased a piece of land in Khoraj village near Ahmedabad city from farmer Shamjibhai and his family in 2020.

Since Shamjibhai had sold the land to the petitioners before repaying a crop loan of Rs 3 lakh taken from the SBI, the petitioners (who are new owners of the land) could not enter their names in the revenue records because of the bank’s charge on the land parcel.

Though the farmer later repaid the entire amount to the bank, the SBI did not issue a no-dues certificate, following which the new owners moved the high court two years ago.

During the hearing last week, when Justice Karia had asked the bank to submit the no-dues certificate in the court, SBI’s lawyer Anand Gogia said, ""It’s not possible because there is an outstanding amount of 31 paise. It is system generated."""

Union Bank of India became the first public sector bank to go live on the Account Aggregator (AA) ecosystem, the bank said on April 29.

Touted as the UPI moment for lending, the AA framework ensures swift data sharing with the consent of the user and eliminates the need for physical documents.

Since it went live in September 2021, 332,000 customer accounts have been linked and over 310,000 consent requests have been fulfilled.

The framework facilitates sharing of financial information on a real-time basis between regulated entities. AAs are licensed by the Reserve Bank of India to enable the flow of data between Financial Information Providers (FIPs) and Financial Information Users (FIUs).

FIPs are institutions that hold customer data and FIUs are entities that consume data to offer better service, underwrite loans, and so on. Banks and other financial institutions must become FIPs to be able to also become users of data from other financial institutions.

An AA is data blind and only receives encrypted data which is decrypted only by the FIU.

Union Bank of India has said that it will work both as an FIU and FIP to allow its customers to share data digitally on a real-time basis.

Major private sector banks like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are already live as FIPs and FIUs. There are 34 banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and other institutions so far live on AA, including Federal Bank, IDFC First Bank and IndusInd Bank.

Moneycontrol had reported on January 17 that the next step for the ecosystem is to grow the number of FIPs and get more banks to go live, mainly the State Bank of India (SBI) which has the largest share of accounts in India.

As per information on the website of Sahamati, a not-for-profit self-organised collective for the AA ecosystem, SBI is in the testing mode.

The ecosystem is also working on linking accounts of Small and Medium Enterprises as only individual current and savings accounts are linked currently. Insurers are working on integrating too and the next step will be to get mutual funds on board.

CAMS, FinVu, NADL and OneMoney have launched AA app and website interfaces for customers to use."

The country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has raised its marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points (bps) or 0.1 per cent across all tenures, a move that will lead to an increase in EMIs for borrowers. The lending rate revision by SBI is likely to be followed by other banks in the days to come.

With the increase, EMIs will go up for those borrowers who have availed loans on MCLR, not for those, whose loans are linked to other benchmarks. SBI's EBLR rate is 6.65 per cent, while the repo-linked lending rate (RLLR) is 6.25 effective April 1.

Banks add Credit Risk Premium (CRP) over the EBLR and RLLR while giving any kind of loan including housing and auto loans. The revised MCLR rate is effective from April 15, as per the information posted on SBI website.

With the revision, one-year MCLR has increased to 7.10 per cent, from the earlier 7 per cent. An overnight, one-month and three-month MCLR rose by 10 bps to 6.75 per cent, whereas a six-month MCLR increased to 7.05 per cent.

Most of the loans are linked to the one-year MCLR rate. At the same time, two-year MCLR increased by 0.1 per cent to 7.30 per cent, while three-year MCLR rose to 7.40 per cent.

From October 1, 2019, all banks including SBI have to lend only at an interest rate linked to an external benchmark such as RBI's repo rate or Treasury Bill yield. As a result, monetary policy transmission by banks has gained traction. The impact of the introduction of external benchmark-based pricing of loans on monetary transmission has been felt across various sectors, encompassing even those sectors that are not directly linked to external benchmark-based loan pricing.

""Looking ahead, the proportion of loans linked to external benchmarks is expected to increase further along with a commensurate fall in the internal benchmark linked loans. Coupled with shorter reset periods, monetary transmission to banks' interest rates can, thus, be expected to strengthen further, a recently released article by RBI said.

On the high court's directions, the CBI has taken over the FIR earlier registered by the Rajasthan Police.

The matter came to light after the SBI branch decided to carry out counting of money after a preliminary enquiry indicated discrepancy in the cash reserve at the bank.

A Jaipiur-based private vendor was roped in to carry out the counting of coins worth over Rs 13 crore, according to branch account books.

State Bank of India Chairman Dinesh Khara on April 13 said the bank may post over 10 percent credit growth in FY22 and that the credit offtake is likely going to be higher next year.

“Going forward, as of now, we are seeing some kind of a better capacity utilisation in terms of the working capital utilisation and term-loan offtake. This is a trend we observed towards the end of the last quarter (Q4FY22) and also it is likely to persist going forward,” Khara said in an interaction with CNBC TV-18.

Khara said sectors that have seen a spurt in credit offtake are essentially from the core sector, which includes iron and steel and cement. Some capital expenditure is also seen in automobile and e-mobility sector. Infrastructure projects are also driving credit demand in airport and port sector, he said.

Though there has been a rise in credit offtake, there exists a lag between sanctions and disbursals. Corporates are applying for credit but they are not fully utilising their sanctioned loan limit.

Asked whether the merger between Housing Development Finance Corp and HDFC Bank challenge SBI’s market share in the home loan segment, Khara said the bank will be “more than happy” to rejig its products and platform to capture demand.

“I always feel that competition brings more and more agility. I think being the largest home loan provider, that is a trigger for us to ensure that we should stay largest ever. So for that whatever is required to be done, we will be more than happy looking into our product and platform,” he said.

The chief of the country's largest lender does not foresee more than 1 percent rise in interest rates on home loans this fiscal. The rates are now linked to the repo rate, but underwriting of new home loans will be based on whether the liquidity stays in surplus mode.

""We had last quarter itself started increasing our term deposit interest rate. We are very mindful of this kind of a scenario in long time and we will certainly keep on calibrating our interest rates to address depositors expectation,” Khara said."

The Russia-Ukraine conflict is rapidly dividing the world into two camps. But India has so far managed to retain its stand– of neutrality–which serves its political and economic interests. There have been concerns that India’s stand may invite western nations’ displeasure, but SBI’s Group Chief Economic Advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh has a different take. In an interview with Moneycontrol, he explained why he sees a new world order taking shape and how India can collaborate with Russia to benefit from it.

The interview reflects his personal views.

You have said that Indian exporters could benefit from the standoff between Russia and the western economies. Which sectors in particular could benefit and how?

While the Indian exports to Russia in terms of quantitative scale have not been worth much (as discussed in our report), there would be great scope of increased exports in traditionally traded items such as pharmaceuticals, tea, rice, and in new areas such as medical devices, software/hardware, transport, machinery, mobile and telecom devices, chemicals, textiles/clothing and apparels, leather, ceramics and agriculture inputs. India is already working on ‘Sangam’, a key policy initiative in exports to Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. Russia’s ‘disconnect’ from other trading partners should create a void, which India would be able to fill… without risking being labelled an outlier by the west. The rapidly unfolding events make it difficult to predict a timeline over which this shift in trade relations will happen, but the time taken should be inversely co-related with impact of sanctions. The deeper the sanctions go, the more the opportunities that will open up for India (though, reduced purchasing power may curtail non-essential buying greatly). The two countries had planned to touch $30 billion trade by 2025, but the current scenario should get us to that target much before.

Also read: The war an opportunity for rupee's internationalisation: Ghosh

Like you have said, Russia is likely to swing towards China. It seems inevitable that this would happen. How can India present itself as a stronger economic ally to Russia?

The hob-nobbing between Russia and China seems more towards giving the west a fitting reply that it should stop policing the new world order, as digital architectures are changing the contours of trades. This has made the world truly flatter, opening new lines of trouble-free communication across geographies. This posturing suits China, which has been short charged in the recent past, for example, with the banning of Tik-Tok and Huawei/other telecom firms. Also, two years of Covid-19-led disturbance has caused mistrust to build in the western economies, and they are being forced to reconsider their huge imports from the mainland and (diversify) at the first chance.

Given all this and India’s growing global acceptability, the dominance of the Indian diaspora in circles of influence worldwide and the maturity shown by the political leadership here, Russia will need to adopt a balanced approach with China. Russia will need to give enough elbow room to India, its tried and tested partner of decades, with non-binding terms and zero baggage.

Also, China does not seem to be dictating terms to Russia and its allies on what moves they should make in the current gameplan. Also China would not want to appear as involved in the current turmoil since its exports to the world are already under threat from other Asian powers.Which sectors in India will benefit from allowing Russian investments in the corporate debt market?

The discussions around allowing Russian investments in India’s corporate debt markets are nothing new, since the two countries have already set goals of reaching bilateral investments of $50 billion by the year 2025. In the current arrangement, the Russian side should be given a choice to invest in bonds of better-rated corporations first, without much stress on sector specific allocations.

With the earlier Rupee-Ruble (R/R) arrangement falling apart from the huge trade imbalance, what makes you optimistic about a similar arrangement this time--of participating in each other's debt markets through the local currency?

The earlier R/R arrangement, in all probability, was propagated at one of the most inopportune moments, with erstwhile USSR’s experiments with Glasnost and Perestroika having gone awfully wrong while India’s own BoP nightmares made the exercise utterly meaningless. In 2022, the economic realities have changed–countries are facing different kinds of economic challenges and aggressions. For example, currency wars are taking a new shape, with the onslaught of digital currencies and central banks’ hurried responses in propagating CBDCs to check this tornado. In this new reality, the R/R arrangement should work well for India and Russia in settling (bilateral netting would be preferred) the imports and exports in select domains such as defence, energy, food grains calibrated and stabilised as we reach the bridge. As of now, the investments are being proposed in Indian Corporate markets. Indian investors, who have diverse global portfolio allocations, may not be as interested to shop around the red square since they would be worried about the US actions.

If the war prolongs and there is further isolation of Russia, will the alternate payment system set up by RBI and VEB be sustainable? Will Indian banks face sanctions?

Going by the payment and settlement structure, the final arrangement is between the two central banks (RBI and VEB (SDC)). Individual banks have been kept out, to protect them. We think the mechanism devised will work well. It involves individual customers raising invoices and receiving payments in their designated bank accounts, through mirror accounts maintained by respective banks, at the central banks. Since the mechanism is between two central banks, the chances of individual banks inviting sanctions seem far-fetched.

What are the risks of increasing exposure to the Russian economy, when India is dealing with a rising inflation?

The pricing of the Ural oil, at a hefty discount from pre war price levels, will help in the government’s efforts to not front load the spiralling prices to common people. India acting to secure some energy security, even while opening two-way channels of economic co-operation, should actually reduce the inflationary pressures through new opportunities.

If India deepens its ties with Russia and upsets the US, won't it be risking its $170+ billion (FY22, April-Dec) software exports?

Henry Kissinger, the celebrated US diplomat, credited with shaping the US foreign policy, in particular with its Asian counterparts in the seventies, once famously quipped that it was the economic interests that decided America’s friendships. The US needs India more than others to balance the power in the resurgent Asian peninsula. The US’s interests are served well by India’s lucrative, upwardly mobile markets, and its fiercely independent tech behemoths are linked strongly to Indian software/hardware supply and human capital. Therefore, it is nearly impossible for India’s software industry to face any headwinds through India’s tilt towards Russia.

Also read: The world can't break its oil habit

Since Russian oil only accounts for 2-3% of India's oil imports currently, can India realistically depend heavily on Russia for its energy needs? Won’t recalibrating supply chains and refining technologies be time consuming, and extremely difficult during a conflict situation?

The recent announcements from MEA and the Indian embassy / Consulates in Russia give an insight into India’s efforts to build an alternate supply chain, capable of handling additional imports from the Russian side, should the math work out profitably for us. There have been hectic parleys and meetings between the oil majors from both sides. The shipping contract stipulates that it would be the responsibility of the exporter to reach the crude at designated Indian ports, thereby eliminating any high seas risk of embargoes affecting the Indian side. So, practically Indian oil majors have little worries on the transport part, or associated costs since it would be borne by Russian majors. Ural oil definitely has a little complex constitution (compared to Brent) but given the technical wherewithal of our refiners, a little tweak in system should take care of cracking complexities at upstream and downstream points.

"April 04, 2022 08:07 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hdfc-twins-to-join-hands-in-the-mother-of-all-mergers-india-inc-reacts-8316931.html,"India’s largest housing finance company, HDFC Ltd, and India’s largest private sector bank, HDFC Bank, have announced plans for a transformational merger that will create a financial services behemoth with mouth-watering prospects for synergies, cross-selling, and value unlocking for shareholders. This will result in the creation of India’s third-largest listed firm and the markets gave a thumbs up to the move with shares of both firms surging during days trade on April 4.

Veteran banker and HDFC Ltd Chairman Deepak Parekh summed up the deal aptly when he said, “ After 45 years in housing finance and after providing 9 million homes to Indians, we have to find a home for ourselves. And we have found a home in our own family company, HDFC Bank”

But what’s India Inc’s take on this mega-deal which has sent ripples through the industry?

Moneycontrol’s Ashwin Mohan spoke to a cross-section of senior industry executives who weighed in with their views –

Ajay Piramal, chairman of Piramal Group which is present in the financial services segment told Moneycontrol, “ I think this is a tremendous event and a really nice culmination of the contribution that Mr Deepak Parekh has made to the Indian financial services industry. I give him full credit for creating the finest financial services institution, whether it's a bank, NBFC, or an insurance company. I am delighted and was waiting for this day and it has come. This feat by Mr. Parekh reminds me of Dhoni's match-winning six in the 2011 World Cup"".

The head honcho of another diversified conglomerate Harsh Goenka, Chairman, RPG Enterprises called it a “watershed moment” for India’s financial sector. He elaborated, “ The merger has a very strong rationale that includes a mammoth balance sheet which should make cost of funds competitive, significant potential for synergies and a global scale of operations. It’s a win-win for all stakeholders. Ek aur ek gyarah.”

“This should have happened earlier, but better late than never, “ says former Sebi chairman M Damodaran who has founded Excellence Enablers, corporate governance think tank. He believes the proposed merger of these two large entities should be positive for all stakeholders

Veteran investment banker and chairman of DSP Group Hemendra Kothari who is Deepak Parekh’s junior from Sydenham College, Mumbai feels Parekh, the “godfather” of the group and the person behind its meteoric rise over the past few decades will be missed for his experience and astute business sense.

The deal is expected to take around 15 to 18 months to complete and RBI norms do not allow anyone above 75 years to be on the board of a bank. Parekh has already crossed that age. Atanu Chakroborty, the current chairman of HDFC Bank is expected to chair the combined entity with HDFC Bank CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan in the corner office.

“ The ratings of the institution will improve and on the distribution side, HDFC Ltd will be much stronger than before ( especially for their insurance vertical),” Kothari added

Speaking about the merger benefits for both the firms, Pramod Kumar, Managing Director & Head of Banking, Barclays India said, “For the bank, it completes its suite of products including having mortgage assets on its own books. To HDFC, the bank can provide even lower-cost funding to the mortgage business. Even though HDFC was always borrowing at very fine rates on its own strengths but still bank deposits can be cheaper than that. Besides, it gives HDFC shareholders an additional opportunity to grow beyond just mortgage and own a much more diversified mix of businesses.”

Addressing some of the key challenges, Kumar added, “ There are some obvious issues to address like Debentures, ECBs, SLR and CRR as well as ownership stakes into several investments that HDFC has in the asset management, life and non-life insurance businesses, which I am sure RBI would need to look into. What we might miss is the HDFC DNA of spawning new and very successful businesses that have created huge value in the past but hopefully, the bank will be able to preserve and nurture that !”

Private equity veteran and ex Citi India CEO Sanjay Nayar feels the mega transaction makes a lot of strategic sense for both the organisations as well as their respective customers. “ There is a clear impetus for the mortgage business on a combined basis. This is a complex deal subject to regulatory approvals and there could be challenges in execution but I am sure they must have proactively addressed those.”

In response to a query on whether the transaction would trigger consolidation in the banking sector, former SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar who is an advisor to Baring Private Equity Asia and Kotak Investment Advisors told CNBC TV-18, “It may trigger the desire to consolidate amongst private sector banks, don’t see the further possibility of mergers in public sector banks. You need a certain scale today to operate along with investments in technology which are substantial.”

Kumar, who is also on the boards of HSBC Asia Pacific and BharatPe, further added, “There has always been a desire and need felt for larger entities in the banking system. HDFC Bank is a strong entity and it now becomes stronger."""

HDFC-HDFC Bank merger has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances are in favour. But, the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner saying the regulatory environment is not conducive.

Parekh had said that the merger makes sense provided there is no loss of value for shareholders and considering the business synergy between two institutions.

HDFC-HDFC Bank Merger LIVE

But, there is a question on the timing of the merger; why did they choose to do it now?

One key reason could be the emerging regulatory approach of the banking regulator to NBFCs. The benefit of continuing as an NBFC is nearly absent now compared with the older times.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been tightening regulations on the NBFC sector over years, grouping these entities into different categories based on size and interconnectedness and making capital norms stricter.

As per an RBI discussion paper released early last year, these layers bracket NBFCs according to their asset size and systemic interconnectedness.

The bigger ones are grouped in the upper layer while stringent regulations will apply to the middle layer as well. The top layer is reserved for companies that are perceived to carry elevated risks akin to the banks under the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework.

If these proposals are accepted as regulations, the top 25-30 NBFCs will have to gradually embrace bank-like regulations. That will minimise the benefit of lighter regulation they have enjoyed so far. NBFCs in the upper layer will have to comply with common equity Tier 1 capital regulations like commercial banks.

They need to maintain a 9 percent CET1 ratio. That apart, these NBFCs will have to comply with large exposure framework and listing regulations.

Clearly, the trigger for the new scale-based approach for NBFCs was aimed at disincentivizing non-banks from growing too big after the IL&FS and DHFL episodes. The regulator doesn’t want a parallel set of financial institutions growing in the financial system at par with the size of banks but enjoying lighter regulation. Also, the RBI wants to bring down the number of NBFCs in the banking system.

For HDFC, which is an NBFC, it makes sense to be part of the bank given the regulatory approach.

So, in a sense, what has aided the merger is the phased regulations from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which has bridged the gap of regulations between banks and non-banking finance companies. Larger NBFCs and banks aren’t very different from a regulatory perspective in terms of scrutiny and capital ratio requirements. Also, as Parekh said in the merger statement, a booming mortgage lending market offers opportunities for home loan lenders.

The Jagdishan factor?

HDFC Bank insiders say compared with the previous boss of the bank, Aditya Puri, his successor Sashidhar Jagdishan was more lenient to the idea of merger. Puri exited the bank in October, 2020. Jagdishan took charge as the new chief in October. “The change in leadership made it easier for the parent to proceed with the merger. At least that’s what the talk is,” said the insider who didn’t wish to be named.

Then there are other factors as well.

Obviously, the merger gives HDFC access to cheaper deposits as well. An NBFC typically raises funds at a higher rate from investors and money markets while a bank has access to public deposits that come at a much cheaper rate through current, savings accounts. That is certainly a beneficial factor for the merger.

What about investors? Prima facie, the deal looks good for investors.

As per the announcement today, every HDFC shareholder will get 42 shares of the bank for every 25 shares they hold.

“Looking from the shareholder’s perspective, it is a positive measure. Because, the shareholders of HDFC Ltd, who was having a holding company discount issue will benefit because the holding company discount will disappear. And for shareholders of HDFC Bank too, the synergy of the combined entity will benefit them,” said J N Gupta, former executive director at the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

With the parent finally merging the bank, the resultant entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry. The window for cross selling products and leveraging the strength of the combined balance sheet will give advantage to the combined entity.

Bigger money muscle

The merged entity, with a larger balance sheet will enable HDFC to turn even more aggressive in the market. It will be only second to the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) across all parameters. The combined entity will have a market cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore and a balance sheet of Rs17.87 lakh crores. It will enable the HDFC Bank to undertake larger underwriting at scale.

HDFC Bank, on a standalone basis, had total advances of Rs 12.7 lakh crore while HDFC had Rs5.25 lakh crore. Of its total advance book, HDFC has 77 percent of its loans in the individual loan category. HDFC Bank, which has 28 percent of its loan book in retail and 26 per cent in corporate, can have the advantage of HDFC’s home loan clients joining the bank’s customers.

It also gives opportunities in cross selling of different products in the unsecured loan segment, insurance, credit cards to HDFC’s existing customers.

When will the merger process be completed?

There is still some time ahead. The merger, as guided by the parent, is expected to get completed by the second or third quarter of financial year 2024. The scheme of amalgamation will need approvals from SEBI, RBI, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) and Competition Commission of India (CCI). It will also require approvals from National Company Law Tribunals and finally will be filed with ROC.

With the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger, another giant is born in the Indian financial sector. SBI, the largest in terms of assets in the Indian banking industry, gets a bigger competitor.

Indian banks are embracing co-lending to scale up business in an unprecedented manner. State Bank of India and Union Bank of India alone have signed about a dozen agreements for co-lending – where loans are issued jointly by two entities – in the past six months alone, senior bankers told Moneycontrol.

SBI has signed over eight such agreements while Union Bank has signed three co-lending agreements, the bankers said.

“Co-lending will be pursued as an important tool to increase the microfinance, MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) and affordable housing portfolio,” SBI chairman Dinesh Khara said on September 29.

Co-lending refers to partnerships between two lenders, typically a bank and a non-bank, to offer loans to the economically weaker sections or borrowers under the so-called priority sector lending (PSL) programme.

SBI will continue to work with more non-banking finance companies and microfinance institutions to reach out to customers living in far-flung areas and provide them last-mile banking services.

Experts said co-lending has picked up recently as banks want to aggressively tap a revival in demand for credit after a dull pandemic-phase. Co-lending helps bank to meet their PSL targets. Also, banks see an opportunity in the last-mile coverage of NBFCs and their ability to source loans quickly to meet disbursal targets.

How it works



Although the co-lending concept has existed in the banking sector for a while, it hasn’t picked up in a big way for various reasons.

The Reserve Bank of India had initially come out with the co-origination framework in 2018, allowing banks and NBFCs to co-originate loans. As per the RBI norms, 20 percent of the credit risk by way of direct exposure will be on an NBFC’s books till maturity and the balance will be on the bank’s books.

Upon maturity, the repayment or recovery of interest is shared by the bank and NBFC in proportion to their share of credit and interest.

The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent curbs significantly affected the banking sector’s credit growth. Bank loan growth to industry, however, improved to 6.4 percent in January 2022 from 0.7 percent in January 2021, as per RBI data released on February 28, signalling a gradual recovery in the economy.

SBI takes lead

To tap into reviving credit demand, SBI, the country’s largest lender, has been pro-actively involved in co-lending. Since September, the public sector bank has signed co-lending partnerships with NBFCs in different fields of priority sector lending.

On September 29, SBI signed co-lending partnerships with Vedika Credit Capital, Save Microfinance and Paisalo Digital to disburse loans to members of joint liability groups for agriculture and allied activities, including other income-generation activities.

For co-lending to micro, small and medium enterprises, SBI signed co-lending agreements with U Gro Capital and Capri Global Capital.



SBI also formed partnerships with Adani Capital for co-lending to farmers and with five housing finance companies – PNB Housing Finance, IIFL Home Finance, Shriram Housing Finance, Edelweiss Housing Finance, and Capri Global Housing Finance – to sanction home loans.

SBI is not the only PSU lender going aggressive in co-lending. Bank of Baroda projects a decent share of its disbursements coming from co-lending this year.

“FY23 would be our first complete year in co-lending, so we will look at around 5 percent of the overall disbursement,” Dhrubashish Bhattacharya, head of MSME business at Bank of Baroda, told Moneycontrol.



“As a strategy, we would like to partner with NBFCs having core competence in one or two product lines, with each partner focusing on specific product lines in specific geographies. The sectors in focus are green energy, healthcare, infrastructure and micro loans.”

Private sector lender South Indian Bank is also keen on entering the co-lending space, according to managing director Murali Ramakrishnan. The lender is in talks with Chennai-based CredAvenue to offer loans via the co-lending model and this partnership will “hopefully” start this year, Ramakrishnan told Moneycontrol.

“Co-lending is definitely something which we are looking at very seriously. We are in talks with a few NBFCs and we are looking at personal loans, gold loans and home loans,” Ramakrishnan said. “We are expecting some decent amount of book size will be built through co-lending in FY23.”

NBFCs that sign a co-lending pact with banks get access to cheap funds, while banks benefit from the last-mile reach of smaller non-banks.

This is also why Shriram Group aims to book loans of Rs 500 crore to Rs 1,000 crore via co-lending partnerships in FY23, managing director YS Chakravarti told Moneycontrol.

He said Shriram City Union has a significant part of its book under priority sector lending areas and co-lending will be focused on that part, which is mainly home loans and SME loans.

The NBFC’s housing finance subsidiary, Shriram Housing Finance, has partnered with SBI for affordable home loans and the non-bank lender will “test the waters with the new format” and see if they can look at other such partnerships with like-minded companies.

“For the model to work, both entities need to have robust technology to simplify operational challenges. Thus, only once we have confidence in the cost actually coming down for the end-user and it being a profitable means of growth for us, will we explore growing this part of the book,” Chakravarti said."

Merchant payments and lending platform Pine Labs has raised $50 million from United Kingdom-headquartered investment firm Vitruvian Partners, the company said on March 30.

The fundraise is one of three investments received by Pine Labs this year as the company gears up for its $500 million initial public offering (IPO) in the United States.

While Pine Labs did not reveal its valuation after the round, Moneycontrol learnt that it stands at $5-5.5 billion.

Pine Labs CEO Amrish Rau said in a statement, “At Pine Labs, we are deeply focused on the omnichannel play and are building frictionless and seamless payment experiences for our merchant partners and large enterprises. We aim to further strengthen our recent foray in online payments via Plural and take our Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) offering to new markets through strategic collaborations.”

In January this year, Pine Labs also secured a $20 million investment from India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI). This was followed by a $150 million fundraise from Alpha Wave Global.

In 2021 alone, the company raked in a total of $900 million in investments. The first $258 million was raised in May 2021 from public market crossover investors including Baron Capital Group, Duro Capital, Marshall Wace, Moore Strategic Ventures and Ward Ferry Management.

In July 2021, the company raised $600 million at a valuation of $3 billion led by Fidelity, Blackrock and other investors.

In September 2021, the firm announced it had raised $100 million more from US-based investment management company Invesco. The investment was done through the Invesco Developing Markets Fund.

“Our investment in Pine Labs follows several investments we have made into the digital payments space, and we’re excited to partner with the management team as they continue to drive digital transformation within the rapidly growing Indian payments market,” said Peter Read, partner at Vitruvian Partners.

Pine Labs’ omnichannel payments platform approach combined with its expanding geographic footprint prompted the investment, Read added.

The company’s core payment offering is point of sale machines for offline payments and it is expanding its BNPL offering in Southeast Asia. Earlier this month, the firm had launched ‘Mastercard Installments with Pine Labs’ programme with Mastercard and DBS Bank for Singapore, Indonesia, and Hong Kong with pay later instalment purchase options at the point of sale.

In the past year, Pine Labs expanded offerings and entered the consumer payments space with the acquisition of Fave in April 2021. The company also forayed into online payments with the launch of its payment gateway platform Plural in October 2021.

Plural is expected to make the offline-to-online transition easier for Pine Labs’ merchant base and is aimed at merchants and enterprises looking to set up afresh or boosting their online commerce business.

The company, backed by Sequoia Capital, Temasek Holdings, Actis, PayPal, and Mastercard among other global investors, is reported to have filed confidentially for the IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been appointed as advisors for the float."

A subsidiary of Edelweiss Financial Services, EHFL said this alliance will leverage the combined reach of both the partners in tier II and tier III markets to ensure timely disbursal of housing credit to customers.

Under the partnership, both the companies will share risks and rewards involved in the lending business.

It aims to create a conducive lending environment for Indians to fulfil their ambition of homeownership, EHFL said in a release.

For EHFL, co-lending represents an alternate model of disbursals that is asset-light and creates a sound revenue model for sustainable business, whereas for SBI — which brings capital flows at lower costs — the partnership provides wider customer reach.

For customers, co-lending provides simplicity of dealing with a single entity for their financing needs up to Rs 35 lakh, in addition to benefiting from blended cost-effective interest rates.

""This collaboration will enhance our distribution network, as we aim to extend our credit reach to more home loan borrowers of the unserved and underserved segments. Such partnerships align with our commitment to accelerate effective and affordable credit to small home buyers in India and contribute to the vision of Housing for All by 2024,” Dinesh Khara, Chairman State Bank of India, said.

EHFL MD and CEO Rajat Avasthi said: ""Owning a home is an important milestone and dream for every Indian. And this partnership will help us fulfil that deep-rooted aspiration for Indians. I believe easy availability of home loans will also lead to higher demand in the real estate sector, which is a key driver for economic growth as well”.

The co-lending model is an evolutionary agreement that combines the expertise of public sector banks with the strong origination expertise and reach of HFCs, EHFL said."

The country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on Thursday said it has entered into co-lending agreements with five housing finance companies to serve the underserved and unserved borrowers.

The five housing finance companies (HFCs) are: PNB Housing Finance, IIFL Home Finance, Shriram Housing Finance, Edelweiss Housing Finance, and Capri Global Housing Finance.

SBI said the partnerships are aimed at sanctioning home loans to the unserved and underserved sector in line with RBI guidelines.

Shortage in affordable housing continues to be a major concern for India, especially for the economically weaker section (EWS) and the informal sections of the society, SBI said in a release.

To further improve the penetration in this segment, SBI is actively looking at co-lending opportunities with multiple HFCs.

""This collaboration will enhance our distribution network as we aim to extend our credit reach to more home loan borrowers of the unserved and underserved segments. Such partnerships align with our commitment to accelerate effective and affordable credit to small home buyers in India,” SBI Chairman Dinesh Khara said.

He said the tie-ups will contribute to the government’s vision of 'Housing for All by 2024’.

RBI had issued guidelines on the co-lending scheme for banks and HFCs/NBFCs for priority sector lending to improve the flow of credit to the unserved and underserved sectors of the economy and make funds available to borrowers at an affordable cost.

The co-lending model aims to give the borrower the best interest rate and better reach, it said.

In a separate release, Shriram Housing Finance said the two entities will jointly service housing loan customers as per the 20:80 co-lending model of the RBI.

""The demand for housing is immense in the affordable segment and we have barely scratched the surface. Through the co-lending model, we intend to leverage the balance sheet strength of SBI and our underwriting capabilities,” Ravi Subramanian, MD & CEO, Shriram Housing Finance, said.

PNB Housing Finance Managing Director and CEO Hardayal Prasad said: ""Our strategic partnership with SBI is an important extension of our retail home loan segment, and will enable us to serve India’s working classes and underserved communities better.”

Co-lending is the future of priority sector lending, as it reduces the cost of financing for last-mile borrowers, Prasad said.

Rajesh Sharma, Managing Director, Capri Global Housing Finance, said this partnership will help increase both enterprises’ profitability and expand respective home loan portfolios.

""We are confident that the collaboration with the country’s biggest lender will open up more opportunities for home finance to every credit-worthy borrower and act as an agent of change in fulfilling the dreams of owning a home,"" Sharma said."

In a recent article, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at State Bank of India, wrote that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government must rely on unconventional policies to navigate the economic uncertainties that may emerge from the war.

In an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol, Ghosh spoke about how India should seize the opportunity afforded by domestic political stability and the conflict in Europe to push the rupee’s internationalisation. Edited excerpts from the interview:

Do you think there could be spill-over effects of India following an unconventional monetary policy?

Given the large size of the government borrowing programme, with inflation running at more than 6 percent and growth still recovering during a time when the war has created uncertainty, the central bank is not in a position to raise rates immediately. Thus, it needs to look at unconventional policy responses, but (at the same time) it needs to take cognisance of the fact that system liquidity is not so much in a surplus mode that it can fuel speculation.

Regarding spill-over effects, the central bank has been very conscious of the fact that liquidity modulates in the desired fashion. Due to the uncertainty, the liquidity normalisation, which was getting to the desired pace, has been disrupted in February and March, so I believe it is important to take these steps at this point of time so as to manage overall macroeconomic stability. Thus, there is no need to be too much concerned about the spill-over effects.

India has a large number of crypto investors and crypto may have a role in the war. Can it affect Indian crypto investors?

I don’t think investors need to have any such fear...the government of India has mentioned very clearly that it is going to tax all sorts of crypto transactions at the rate of 30 percent. Currently, the central bank is working on a digital currency and hopefully, the introduction of the digital currency tool will be able to take care of the financial stability risks posed by the crypto market. So, there is hardly any chance of financial instability being caused through the crypto market due to the war situation.

Will India alone adopting unconventional monetary policy help calm markets unnerved by the war?

Unconventional monetary policies are always specific to the country itself. While India could adopt such a policy, it may not be appropriate for other countries. Therefore, every country has its own unique position. So, the monetary policy a central bank will be implementing in a country would be in consonance with the particular objectives of the central bank in the particular country. However, an unconventional monetary policy could also be supplemented with some out-of-the-box thinking (to push the internationalisation of the rupee).

... we all know that the US dollar is the reserve currency and no currency has been able to replace the dollar. That is the reason why every country finds it difficult to diversify its foreign exchange reserves. The Chinese currency has also not been able to do it because there is an element of trust factor. The European Union currency also failed to do it.

Given the fact that India currently is in a position of political stability, India can use this opportunity to get into some sort of trade agreement with some countries like Russia that could bypass the dollar. So, the intention of the Indian currency can be to use the current conflict as an opportunity. There is no harm for India to try and push its currency for internationalisation across borders. It will help the country’s future prospects.

Can an unconventional monetary policy affect foreign direct investment (FDI) in India and cause capital outflow?

I don’t think there could be such a risk. During the pandemic when the FDI inflows declined in Asia, India continued to receive a significant amount of the FDI and a large part of that went to the start-ups. Thus I think there is no such one-to-one causation between capital flow and FDI.

The capital flow from foreign countries is also a function of the macroeconomic stability of the country and also is a risk of sentiment globally. Given the fact that the Fed is likely to raise rates this year, there could be a reversal of capital flows from the emerging economies due to higher rates. This factor is more important to be addressed rather than the fact that unconventional monetary policy could steer capital outflow."

They also said the current account deficit (CAD) will be at 3.5 per cent if crude oil trades at USD 130 a barrel, pulling down growth to 7.1 per cent.

If FY23 average oil price rises to USD 100 a barrel, it will pull down growth to around 7.6 per cent from 8 per cent estimated earlier, inflation will rise to 5 per cent from 4.5 per cent, and the current account gap will jump to USD 86.6 billion or 2.5 per cent of GDP and can soar to 3.5 per cent if oil prices average at USD 130 billion.

In that case, inflation will trend at 5.7 per cent and GDP growth will come down to 7.1 per cent, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the group chief economic adviser at State Bank of India, said in a note on Monday.

The rupee is the worst hit emerging market currency since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the resultant sweeping economic sanctions against Moscow.

Crude has been on the boil since the invasion -- jumping from USD 93 to USD 130 a barrel last week, before moderating to USD 110 levels.

Russia supplies as much as 14 per cent of global crude supplies and 17 per cent of world's natural gas.

The near-term outlook for the rupee remains challenging until geopolitical tensions moderate. With uncertainties being high, this can further dampen portfolio inflows, which have already been in reverse gear so far in 2022 with outflows worth USD 12 billion, he said.

The war has led to almost all other commodities, including agri commodities, witnessing price increases.

Forecasting really tough time for the rupee, which had last week plunged to a record low of 77.01, he said if the Ukraine conflict drags on for now, rupee can tumble to 77.5 by June and marginally improve to 77 to a dollar by December 2022.

Even if the Russian-Ukraine conflict drags on for now, though the rupee is likely to trade in an elevated zone, the FY23 average should not be higher than 76-78, with an appreciating bias, Ghosh added.

During the last global financial crisis, the rupee continued to decline and lost around 13 per cent during January 2008 to July 2011. However, after the crisis, the volatility became significant and the rupee plunged by a whopping 41 per cent during July 2011 to November 2013.

On the impact of the extreme volatility in crude oil prices on CAD, inflation and GDP, he said every USD 10 per barrel increase in Brent prices will lead to increase in inflation by 20-25 bps, widen the current account deficit by 35 bps of GDP, increase fiscal deficit by 8 bps and lower GDP by 15-20 bps.

Crude sticking above USD 100 level for next few months along with hurting commodity prices can be the Damocles sword for emerging markets, he noted."

Digitisation and innovative technologies are creating unprecedented disruption in the banking sector, and lenders need to be agile to meet the rising expectations of customers, State Bank of India's Chairman Dinesh Khara said on Friday.

Banks have adopted the digital revolution, which has reduced their cost and widened the area of services they offer, he added.

""Digital innovation is redefining industries and changing the way businesses function. Digitisation and innovative technologies are creating unprecedented disruption in the banking sector and the rate of change is accelerating,"" Khara said at a Dun & Bradstreet event.

Today, digitisation and digital innovations have become a strategic priority for the banking industry, he noted.

""Banks need to be agile and nimble as technology increases customer expectation and the regulatory landscape also evolves rapidly to keep pace with technological advancement,"" he said.

According to Khara, there is a realisation among banks that the scale and adoption of digital transformation are to keep pace with the rapidly changing ecosystem.

To achieve the digital transformation goal, banks and financial institutions need to have a clear vision of what they intend to achieve with technology, he added.

Swift absorption and adoption of new technology and innovation, and quality of infrastructure are crucial elements that play a significant role in building confidence in the digital lending system, he said.

Going forward, banks of all sizes and across regions will make a huge difference by enabling digital initiatives to maintain a competitive edge and deliver a maximum value to customers, he noted.

During a panel discussion at the event, Indian Banks' Association (IBA) Chief Executive Sunil Mehta said the payment space has been digitalised and now it is time for digitisation of lending space.

""The next stage of banking, where the lending space has to be digitised, is on and banks are working on it,"" Mehta added.

He said digitisation of some of the lending products has already been started by banks, but a very small number of products are available that are digitised end-to-end. ""There is a need for digitisation of the entire lending eco-space,"" he noted.

Mehta said that technovation is gradually happening in the banking industry and now the speed is more driven by the pandemic.

During the pandemic, everybody has realised the importance of alternate delivery channels for banking services, he said.

While addressing the event, International Finance Corporation (IFC) Country head (India) Wendy Werner said India is quickly evolving as a digital-enabled economy.

The country has the highest fintech adoption rate in the world and much of this is coming from tier 2 and tier 3 cities, she said.

""So, we are very positive about the impact of fintech and the ability of fintech to expand access to finance, services and information for the population in India. Globally, we have estimated that the fintech market in India is around $50-60 billion and we expect it to grow,"" she said.

Werner said India is a huge market and potentially there are many startups looking to take advantage of that market.

Approximately, 2,100 fintech startups are looking at the Indian market and it is probably increasing every day."

We are happy to bring a marquee investor on board. Our omnichannel strategy is showing strong revenue growth. We are also seeing strong growth in international markets.""

While the company did not reveal the valuation at which the round was raised, an ET report said that the valuation is likely to be $5 billion.

In the last six months, Pine Labs has raised $100 million from investment management company Invesco, as well as $20 million from India's largest bank, the State Bank of India (SBI).

Before these interim raises, the company had raised $600 million at a valuation of $3 billion led by Fidelity, Blackrock and other investors in July 2021.

According to a Bloomberg report, the company has done a confidential filing for the IPO within the first half of this year with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Pine Labs has appointed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as advisors for its IPO and is eyeing a valuation of anywhere between $5.5 and $7 billion.

In-line with its omnichannel plans, Pine Labs also announced its foray into the online payments space in October 2021 (in addition to physical payments) with a payment gateway platform named Plural.

The company has three key products under the Plural brand -- Plural Gateway, Plural Checkout, and Plural Console. Plural Gateway is a payment gateway that allows payment acceptance via over 100 payment modes and is also equipped to process Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) transactions.

With regards to the ongoing ABG Shipyard issue, the State Bank of India (SBI) has clarified in its statement that there was absolutely no effort to delay the dues recovery process from the promoters of the now-bankrupt ABG Shipyard Ltd.

Notably, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked many top executives of the firm, including ex-chairman Rishi Kamlesh Agrawal and director Santhanam Muthuswamy in a bank fraud case worth Rs 22,483 crores.

It has been alleged that the company, through its directors, undertook a loan of Rs 2,925 crore from the SBI and willingly didn't pay. Additionally, loans taken from over 2 dozen other banks were also never repaid.

With ICICI bank being the consortium leader and IDBI bank in tow as the second lead, the formal complaint to CBI was lodged by the State Bank of India, given that it was the largest public service bank serving as a lender in the group.

RBI believes differing policy strategy, policy stance can coexist: SBI report

Detailing the events, SBI in a statement said, “ABG Shipyard was incorporated on March 15, 1985, has been banking arrangements since 2001. Due to poor performance, the account became NPA on 30/11/2013. Several efforts were made to revive the company operations but could not succeed. Despite an attempt to restructure their account under the CDR mechanism in March 2014, the company operations could not revive since the shipping industry at large was witnessing a severe downturn"".

Consequently, SBI noted, “As the restructuring failed, the account was classified as NPA in July 2016 with backdated effect from November 30, 2013. Lenders appointed E&Y as forensic auditor in April 2018, with the consulting behemoth submitting its report before the Fraud Identification Committee constituting 18 lenders in 2019.""

It was then, in November 2019, that the first complaint was filed with the CBI. In its statement, SBI further detailed that ""fraud is mainly attributed to diversion of funds, misappropriation, and criminal breach of trust.""

""There was a continuous engagement between CBI and Banks and further information was getting exchanged. The circumstances of the fraud, as well as CBI requirements, were further deliberated in the various meetings of Joint Lenders and a fresh and comprehensive second complaint was filed in December 2020. The account is presently undergoing liquidation under an NCLT driven process,” it said.

R Srinivasan of SBI Mutual Fund is back with a new focused scheme. Should you invest?

Reportedly, fraud declarations take place on the basis the forensic audit report findings, which is further deliberated upon by the lenders in joint meetings.

Elaborating on the same, the statement detailed that ""Typically when fraud is declared, an initial complaint is preferred with CBI, and based on their enquiries further information is gathered. In a few cases, when substantial additional information is gathered, a second complaint incorporating full and complete details is filed which forms the basis for the FIR. At no point in time, there was any effort to delay the process. The lender’s forum diligently follows through with CBI in all such cases""."
"February 14, 2022 12:31 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/r-srinivasan-of-sbi-mutual-fund-is-back-with-a-new-focused-scheme-should-you-invest-8089151.html,"A change in rules has opened up the multi-cap category for mutual funds. Now, SBI Mutual Fund, India’s largest asset manager, is launching its own multi-cap fund. The new fund offer (NFO) opens on February 14.

What’s the scheme about?

The Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) rules state that a multi-cap fund needs to invest a minimum of 25 percent each in small-cap, mid-cap and large-cap stocks. However, the SBI Multicap Fund will invest 27 percent in each of these categories, with the remainder left to the fund manager’s discretion.

Ruchit Mehta, head of research at SBI MF, said the additional allocation (27 percent instead of 25 percent) is being made as a buffer against market volatility. While the fund will be managed by R Srinivasan, who is head of equity at SBI MF, the portfolio will be built based on ideas generated by its team of 15 sector analysts.

What works

The fund will be benchmarked against Nifty 500 Multicap 50:25:25, but it will not try to align its sector weights just to be closer to the index weights.

As Mehta pointed out, any scheme out there today that’s benchmarked against large-cap indices is forced to make a heavy allocation to the financial services sector, which has as much as a 33 percent weightage in large-cap indices.

“So a benchmark-conscious fund manager will have to manage sector weights so as to reduce the risk of underperforming the index,” he said.

SBI Multicap Fund will not depend upon index weights to construct its portfolio.

The portfolio will capture stock investment ideas through the analyst team’s research framework. The stock research process that the analyst team follows will filter high-conviction investment ideas from SBI MF’s 750 stock coverage, which is split into passive and active universes.

The ideas generated by the analysts will be ranked in order of their preference. Each analyst will assign a confidence score, ranging from 1 to 5, to each stock idea, reflecting their view on aspects such as the company’s fundamentals, growth potential, management quality, and valuations.

There will be an overlay of sector outlook, with preference given to stocks on which the fund house has a positive view.

This list of high-conviction ideas will include international stocks. The fund has built in a provision to invest up to 10 percent of the scheme’s funds in international stocks.

The fund manager will pick from analysts' high-conviction ideas and account for factors such as liquidity of the stock, existing stock ownership and whether a meaningful allocation can be made to the stock. He will take a call on how much funds should be allocated to a particular stock.

What doesn’t

The fund will aim to keep the number of stocks in its portfolio in the range of 30-35 at any given point of time. So, it will be run like a focused fund.

“While taking high-conviction investment calls can give outsized returns, it can also lead to concentration risks, if not managed carefully,” said Rupesh Nagda, founder of Family First Capital.

“There are several research papers out there that suggest that beyond 20 stocks, the benefits of diversification peters down significantly,” said Srinivasan.

A multi-cap fund may go through periods of higher volatility than flexi-cap schemes due to the former’s higher allocations to mid- and small-caps.

Also, multi-cap funds may do well when the broader markets rally, but could underperform if the markets turn narrow and large-cap stocks lead the gains. During such periods, flexi-cap funds could outperform as they can increase their large-cap exposure.

Vishal Dhawan, founder of Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors, said flexi-cap funds may be more suitable for investors right now, given the lack of clarity on whether current market valuations are justified or excessive.

“Getting into a flexi-cap fund with a track record would be better as the fund manager has the flexibility to move allocations across market segments, with no minimum limits,” he said.

Moneycontrol’s take

Srinivasan has considerable experience managing funds with high-conviction investment calls. A multi-cap fund gives an investor exposure to all market segments within a portfolio. But the multi-cap category is still a newly defined category by SEBI and one that needs to build a track record. Once the fund and the category has built a track record, investors can consider the SBI Multicap Fund for their investment portfolio. The NFO closes on February 28."

Dubbing it as the country's biggest bank-fraud case, the Congress questioned the Narendra Modi government on Sunday why it took five years after the liquidation proceedings of ABG Shipyard to lodge an FIR in connection with the alleged duping of 28 banks. The CBI has booked ABG Shipyard Limited, its former chairman and managing director Rishi Kamlesh Agarwal and others for allegedly cheating a consortium of banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) of over Rs 22,842 crore.

""Why did it take five years after the liquidation proceedings of ABG Shipyard to lodge even an FIR for duping 28 banks of Rs 22,842 crore?"" Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala asked at a press conference here. ""Why did the Modi government refuse to take note of the allegations made on February 15, 2018 by the Congress, warning of a scam in ABG Shipyard, and why no FIR was lodged and criminal action taken despite their accounts having been declared as fraud on June 19, 2019?"" he asked.

Surjewala said the SBI wrote to the CBI in November 2018, ""saying there was a fraud committed by ABG Shipyard and seeking the registration of an FIR and criminal action. Despite this, nothing happened and the CBI pushed the files back to the SBI. Public money keeps getting swindled, but no FIR is lodged"". On August 25, 2020, the SBI filed a second complaint with the CBI, saying ""please register an FIR as this is a case of cheating and fraud. But the CBI still does not act. It waits for another year and a half. Finally, now, after five years, this FIR has been registered"", he added.

""The complicity, the collusion and the connivance of those sitting in the highest echelons of the Modi government with bank fraudsters is writ large,"" the Congress leader alleged. He said it was the ""biggest bank fraud"" witnessed by the country.

Surjewala said there seems to be a ""loot-and-escape"" scheme for bank fraudsters while pointing out many instances in the past and adding that the accused in these cases are now in foreign shores. He alleged that ""these indelible facts reflect the gross mismanagement of the banking system, holding the banking system captive to fraudsters and the initiation of the loot-and-escape flagship scheme for bank fraudsters"".

""Over the last seven-and-a-half years of the Modi government, incidents of bank fraud involving a total amount of Rs 5.35 lakh crore have been reported. During this period, the write-offs by the banks in India is Rs 8.17 lakh crore. ""Bank NPAs amounted to Rs 21 lakh crore between 2014 and 2021. That is the state of gross mismanagement of people's money, which is lying in the banking system,"" the Congress leader said, adding, ""India woke up to the rude shock of the biggest ever bank fraud in the last 75 years involving Rs 22,842 crore.""

He claimed that ABG Shipyard was allotted 1.21 lakh square metres of land in 2007 by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Gujarat. ""The comptroller and auditor general had indicted the then Gujarat government for undue favours to ABG Shipyard and Rishi Agarwal over allotting land at Rs 700 per square metre, while the price of the land was 100 per cent higher, that is Rs 1,400 per square metre,"" Surjewala said.

He said the then Gujarat government proceeded to allot 50 hectares of land to ABG Shipyard in Dahej. The SBI had first filed a complaint on November 8, 2019 on which the CBI had sought some clarifications on March 12, 2020.

The bank filed a fresh complaint in August 2020. After ""scrutinising"" the complaint for a year and and a half, the CBI acted on the complaint, filing an FIR on February 7 this year. In its complaint, the SBI said ABG Shipyard Limited (ABGSL) is the flagship company of the ABG Group, which is engaged in the business of ship building and ship repair.

Reacting on the recent development, SBI said, ""ABG Shipyard was incorporated on 15 March 1985, has been banking arrangements since 2001. Financed under Consortium arrangement over a two dozen lenders. The leader in Consortium was ICICI Bank. Due to poor performance, the account became NPA on 30/11/2013. Several efforts were made to revive the company operations but could not succeed.""

The nationalised bank added, "" The account was restructured under the CDR mechanism in March 2014 by all lenders. However, as the shipping industry was going through a downturn, one of the worst ever seen, the operations of the company could not revive.As the restructuring failed, the account was classified as NPA in July 2016 with backdated effect from 30th Nov. 2013. E&Y was appointed as Forensic Auditor by lenders during April 2018 and they submitted their report on January 19. E&Y report was placed before the Fraud Identification Committee of 18 Lenders in 2019. Fraud is mainly attributed to diversion of funds, misappropriation, and criminal breach of trust.""

Furthermore, the SBI said that ICICI Bank was the lead lender in the consortium and IDBI was the second lead, it was preferred that SBI being the largest PSB lender, lodges the complaint with CBI. The first complaint was filed with CBI in Nov 2019. There was a continuous engagement between CBI and Banks and further information was getting exchanged, it added.""

""The circumstances of the fraud, as well as CBI requirements, were further deliberated in the various meetings of Joint Lenders and a fresh and comprehensive second complaint was filed in Dec. 2020. The account is presently undergoing liquidation under an NCLT driven process.A fraud is declared basis the Forensic Audit report findings that are discussed thoroughly in joint lenders meetings. Typically when fraud is declared, an initial complaint is preferred with CBI, and based on their enquiries further information is gathered. In a few cases, when substantial additional information is gathered, a second compliant incorporating full and complete details is filed which forms the basis for the FIR. At no point in time, there was any effort to delay the process. The lender's forum diligently follows through with CBI in all such cases,"" SBI said in a statement."""

Stating that the RBI has surprised everyone with its status quo on rates and accommodative stance for the 10th time in a row and a lower forecast for inflation and growth for FY23, SBI Research said that with this, the central bank has set a clear distinction between policy strategy and policy stance and that these can coexist simultaneously. As result, the bond yields have shed seven basis points (bps) to 6.73 per cent on Thursday after touching 6.88 per cent on the Budget day when the government said it would borrow a record Rs 14.3 lakh crore to fund its capex (capital expenditure) plans of Rs 7.5 lakh crore.

On Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) surprised the market with a policy statement that has a lower gross domestic product (GDP) at 7.8 per cent and an inflation forecast at 4.5 per cent for FY23. This translates into a WPI (Wholesale Price Index) projection of around 2.8 per cent in FY23. The lower inflation forecast has taken the market by surprise and the 10-year yields declined by seven bps to close at 6.73 per cent after falling 10 bps immediately after the policy was announced.

SBI Chief Economic Advisor Soumya Kanti Ghosh expects the yields to decline further to settle at 6.55-6.6 per cent. He also said that even though the market was surprised by the tone of the policy, the RBI may have moved ahead of the market in terms of expectations.

As a result, FY23 could usher in a new era of separate strategy and separate stance, an unconventional monetary policy setting in the true sense, Ghosh added. The RBI has taken three bets in its quest for a lower term structure of interest rates and while doing so, it has also indicated to the market that it is comfortable with making a clear distinction between policy strategy and policy stance and that these can coexist, Ghosh said.

While a policy strategy might indicate the RBI calibrating the liquidity normalisation to ensure that government borrowings face no disruption, the policy stance may still indicate rate adjustment to quell inflation expectations, should inflation surprise on the upside beyond tolerance, he said. These two mutually complement each other as the central bank has several non-conventional policy tools to adjust government borrowings, he added.

Explaining further, Ghosh said the three bets are crude price, US yields and government borrowing programme that determine yield trajectory and these will largely be under control. While crude price increase may have bottomed out, the US yields are on the northward side due to a record high inflation print of 7.5 per cent, which is a 40-year-high level.

The third and the largest elephant in the room is the size of government borrowing (net market borrowing of Rs 11.2 lakh crore, and gross of Rs 14.3 lakh crore) which he expects could be lower by at least Rs 2.5 lakh crore. Notably, small saving rates continue to be attractive. In FY22, small savings collections exceeded the budgeted amount by Rs 2 lakh crore, resulting in net borrowing falling short by Rs 1.7 lakh crore and the challenge lies in FY23 with net borrowings increasing by Rs 3.4 lakh crore but small savings lower by Rs 1.7 lakh crore than the revised FY22 amount.

He expects small saving schemes to continue to surpass budgetary expectations amid surplus savings of households and large rate differential with bank deposit rates in FY23. This is because the government has budgeted Rs 1.75 lakh crore surplus cash balances for FY23 but it could end up having higher surplus cash balances by at least Rs 1 lakh crore, which in turn will provide some relief to the market borrowing, he said.

Ghosh added that if small savings and short-term borrowings through treasury bills are higher by another Rs 1.5 lakh crore, net market borrowing will come down to just Rs 8.7 lakh crore, massively down from the budgeted Rs 11.2 lakh crore. Similarly, if there is no more borrowing in the remaining part of the current fiscal, market borrowing will come down by Rs 71,000 crore, leading to a net borrowing of Rs 7.04 lakh crore as against the revised estimate of Rs 7.75 lakh crore. This could help the bond yields head southwards and even touch 6.55-6.6 per cent in FY22."

Outlook

At CMP, SBI trades at an attractive valuation of 1.7x and 1.6x its FY2023E and FY2024P/BV. The bank is well-positioned to take benefits of the economic recovery. We find SBI is better placed with respect to asset quality, capitalisation, and underwriting strengths. With its business strengths (being India’s largest bank), we expect its NII and profitability to bounce back in the next 2-3 years, helped by higher margins. We expect the bank to benefit from the recovery in the benign corporate credit cycle. In addition, SBI’s stronger deposit franchise, support from subsidiaries, and a low risk of dilution (as compared to PSU bank peers) further support valuations. Hence, we maintain our Buy rating on SBI with an unchanged SOTP-based price target (PT) of Rs. 650.

The dual structure of Bad Bank will be a public-private collaboration with public sector banks having a majority stake in the National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (NARCL) while private banks will have a significant stake in India Debt Resolution Company Ltd, he said.

So far so good. But what’s next?

For sure, the Bad Bank’s journey won’t be a smooth one—even with all that government backing and banking sector. There will be two key challenges—valuation and asset resolution.

Remember, the bad assets waiting to be absorbed by the Bad Bank are really bad assets, which means banks have already tried to resolve these cases for several years but clearly haven’t had much luck. Banks transferring these assets will always want the highest possible valuation but the asset reconstruction companies getting these assets would want a cheaper deal.

Thus, to begin with, most of these bad assets are already fully provided for, written down accounts on the books of banks. They no longer nurture hopes of any meaningful recovery from these assets. Coming to the Bad Bank deal, the most critical part will be how banks arrive at a valuation for the transfer of these assets to NARCL.

Even if some mechanism for price discovery is worked out, the value of the assets is unlikely to exceed 10 percent to 20 percent of the assets at the time of transfer. Banks will want maximum value for the assets being transferred.

The second challenge is the timely resolution.

According to details shared by the finance minister at a press conference last year, banks will receive 15 percent of the value of assets being transferred upfront in cash; 85 percent will be given as security receipts (SRs). If the debt resolution doesn’t happen within a five-year period, the government will have to pay banks against the SRs if the guarantee is invoked. There are no takers for such assets. Bad Bank managers will have their task cut out.

The limited success of the earlier asset resolution mechanisms including debt recovery tribunals, existing asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) and corporate debt restructuring mechanism shows how difficult it is to get such assets back to performing ones and find value in such assets and get takers. Nevertheless, the Bad Bank is a step in the right direction. Hopefully, this will help the Indian banking sector--saddled with bad loans-- to clean up their books and be ready for a fresh start.

But proper execution and asset resolution will be key to make sure the project doesn’t meet the fate of some of the earlier much-hyped initiatives.

Country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on January 29 withdrew the controversial circular that barred women candidates who are pregnant above three months from taking up jobs in the bank.

In view of the public sentiments, SBI has decided to keep the revised instructions regarding recruitment of pregnant women candidates in abeyance and continue with the existing instructions in the matter, the bank said in a statement.

The move came after Delhi Commission for women intervened in the matter and asked the bank explain its action.

The SBI circular dated 31 December said if pregnancy is of more than 3 months, the candidate will be considered temporarily unfit and she may be allowed to join within 4 months after delivery of child.



Responding to this circular, Delhi Women’s commission on 29 January said the action of the bank appears to be discriminatory and illegal as it is contrary to the maternity benefits provided under the ‘Code of Social Security, 2020.’

Further, the rule discriminates on the basis of sex which is against the fundamental rights provided under the constitution, the notice issued by the commission said.

Moneycontrol has copies of the SBI circular and the Delhi Women’s commission circular.

As per earlier rules of SBI, pregnant women candidates were eligible to be appointed in the bank up to six months of pregnancy, provided the candidate furnishes a certificate from specialist gynecologist that her taking up the bank’s employment at that stage is in no way likely to interfere with her pregnancy or the normal development of the foetus, or is not likely to cause her miscarriage or otherwise to adversely affect her health.

But this rule was changed now drawing the ire of employees and Women’s commission.

The Delhi women's commission, in the notice issued to SBI chairman, asked the bank to withdraw the circular and explain the steps taken by the bank to ensure the said guidelines are non-discriminatory to women.

State Bank of India Chairman Dinesh Khara on Friday said the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL) or bad bank and India Debt Resolution Company Ltd (IDRCL) are ready to commence operations and a total of 38 NPA accounts worth Rs 82,845 crore have been identified to be transferred to NARCL initially.

Khara said the transfer of 38 accounts will happen in a phased manner, and in the phase one 15 accounts worth Rs 50,000 crore will be transferred to NARCL in the current financial year.

""In the phase one, about 15 accounts aggregating to Rs 50,000 crore are expected to be transferred to the NARCL. We are trying to have these accounts transferred within this financial year after completing all the required processes,” Khara told reporters.

He said while public sector banks have taken a majority stake in NARCL, IDRCL will be majorly owned by private sector banks.

SBI, Union Bank of India and Indian Bank have picked up 13.27 per cent stake each in NARCL.

Punjab National Bank has acquired close to 12 per cent stake in the bad bank.

Explaining the arrangement, Khara said that NARCL will acquire and aggregate the identified NPA accounts from the banks, while IDRCL, under an exclusive arrangement, will handle the debt resolution process.

This exclusive arrangement will be as per the scope defined in the debt management agreement being executed between the two entities, he said.

The arrangement will be on principal-agent basis and final approval and ownership for the resolution will lie with the NARCL as the principal, he added."

Dinesh Khara, the chairman of country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI), said on January 28 the proposed Bad Bank had received all necessary approvals to start operations.

Public sector Banks will have a majority stake in the National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL) while private banks will have a significant stake in India Debt Resolution Company Limited (IDRCL), Khara said.

Bad Bank was announced by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the last Union Budget. This entity will absorb the bad assets of banks enabling banks to clean up their books.

Explainer: What ails the Bad Bank proposal unveiled in the last budget?

In the initial phase, around 15 cases worth Rs 50,000 crore will be transferred to the proposed bad bank in this fiscal, Khara said. An estimated Rs 2 lakh crore worth bad assets is planned to transfer to the Bad Bank.

“There were certain concerns being raised but eventually both entities have requisite approval,” Khara said. A total of 38 accounts with Rs 83,000 crore outstanding in total have been identified for transfer so far but some of these accounts have been resolved already, Khara said.

As per the operational structure, NARCL will acquire and aggregate identified NPA accounts from banks while IDRCL will handle the debt resolution process.

“This unique public-private partnership will bring benefit of aggregation, expertise to resolve stressed assets,” said Khara, adding he expects faster asset resolution to take place in the banking sector with the establishment of Bad Bank.

Khara said while the initial estimate was Rs 2 lakh crore worth of assets will be transferred to the bad bank, some of the large cases were resolved sub subsequently.

The Bad Bank was conceptualized with the objective of absorbing bad assets from public sector banks for a clean-up of the lenders’ balance sheets. Banks are weighed down by huge amounts of bad loans, or loans on which no interest or principal has been paid for over 90 days.

Stress tests have revealed that banks' gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) may jump from 6.9 percent of assets in September 2021 to 8.1 percent by September 2022 under a baseline scenario and to 9.5 percent under a severe stress scenario, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in its Financial Stability Report on December 29.

If the current wave of COVID-19 led by the Omicron variant drags on, the figure could escalate. According to the plan, banks will receive 15 percent of the value of assets being transferred upfront in cash; 85 percent will be given as security receipts (SRs). If the debt resolution doesn’t happen within a five-year period, the government will have to pay banks against the SRs if the guarantee is invoked.

Khara said he expects resolutions to happen faster with NARCL in place.

An important development

Launch of bad bank is crucial for the banking sector if it leads to faster bad assets resolution.

Banks need to set aside more money to cover bad loans known as provisions in banking industry jargon. The higher the provisions, the bigger is the pain felt by the bank—its profitability subsequently takes a hit. The bank will require more capital to plug the bad loan hole.

A huge pile of bad loans on its balance sheet impairs the ability of a bank to extend fresh loans. When credit growth slows, as was the case to industries over the last few years, the economy suffers. This (economic slowdown and consequent job losses) further impacts the ability of companies and individuals to repay bank loans."

Talace Private Limited — a subsidiary of the Tata Group’s holding company Tata Sons — on October 8, 2021, won the bid to acquire debt-ridden Air India.

A unit of the holding company of the salt-to-software conglomerate had offered Rs 18,000 crore as part of its winning bid — Rs 15,300 crore for Air India’s existing debt and Rs 2,700 crore to be paid as cash to the government.

On October 11, 2021, a Letter of Intent (LoI) was issued to the Tata Group confirming the government’s willingness to sell its 100 per cent stake in the airline.

On October 25, the Centre signed the share purchase agreement for the deal.

The term loans to Talace will help in retiring the high cost borrowings of Air India, the sources said.

The deal with the government does not include land and buildings.

As per the agreement, Tata Group will retain all the employees of Air India at least for a year.

With the acquisition, Tata Group will have access to a fleet of 117 wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, and 24 narrow-body aircraft of Air India Express.

Besides, it will get control of 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing, and parking slots at domestic airports.

Tata Group had surpassed the Rs 15,100 crore-offer by a consortium led by SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh and the reserve price of Rs 12,906 crore set by the government for the sale of its 100 per cent stake in the loss-making carrier.

While this will be the Centre’s first privatisation since 2003-04, Air India will be the third airline brand in the Tatas’ stable as it holds a majority interest in AirAsia India and Vistara, a joint venture with Singapore Airlines Ltd.

As of August 31, Air India had a total debt of Rs 61,562 crore.

Around 75 per cent of this debt or Rs 46,262 crore will be transferred to a special purpose vehicle AIAHL before handing over the loss-making airline to Tata Group.

Air India started suffering losses every year since its merger with Indian Airlines in 2007-08.

A Turnaround Plan (TAP) and a Financial Restructuring Plan (FRP) were approved for Air India by the previous UPA regime in 2012.

However, the TAP did not work out as expected and Air India continued to reel under losses.

Over the last decade, more than Rs 1.10 lakh crore has been infused by way of cash support and loan guarantees into Air India to keep it afloat."

The Account Aggregator (AA) framework, which is expected to transform the way financial data is shared, has seen more than eight-fold spurt in the number of bank accounts linked across last 20 weeks.

The ecosystem is still waiting for India’s largest lender, the State Bank of India (SBI), to go live.

According to data by Sahamati, the not-for-profit self-organised collective for the AA ecosystem, the number of linked bank accounts has gone up from 10,000 in the second week of September 2021 to 80,000 now. The ecosystem has fulfilled 67,000 consent requests till date.

The account aggregator, simply put, facilitates sharing of financial information in a real-time basis between regulated entities. AAs are licensed by the Reserve Bank of India to enable the flow of data between Financial Information Providers (FIPs) and Financial Information Users (FIUs).

FIPs are institutions that hold customer data and FIUs are entities that consume data to offer better service, underwrite loans, etc. An AA is data blind and only receives encrypted data which is decrypted only by the FIP.

“The past few months have been more of testing the system and making sure that you know that things stand up. The click-through rates, success rates are good. The next step for us now is to grow the number of FIPs and the types of accounts types,” Srikanth Rajagopalan, Chief Executive Officer of Perfios Account Aggregation Services, said.

As of now, only individual current and savings accounts and deposits can be linked to AAs. The huge pool of small and medium enterprise (SME) accounts and asset classes like securities, insurance and mutual funds need to be opened up to AAs. This is likely to happen over the next few months.

“Our focus is to now get more banks to go live. We also have to work on cross-sectoral implementation, product and user journey. Insurance companies have started working on implementation. For mutual fund players, we are in talks with them but implementation is yet to begin,” BG Mahesh, Co-founder and CEO of Sahamati, said.

SBI, which has the largest share of accounts in India, however, is working on a pricing model because the bank wants to be compensated as it will be the largest information provider.

“SBI is still trying to figure out a financial model. They want a per data pool pricing to be agreed upon, or a share in the profit earned by the FIUs through the data received. Some of the FIUs are not really open to this idea, but a few are,” said a senior executive with an NBFC on condition of anonymity.

Once SBI goes on board, other large public banks too will follow suit. Sahamati’s website shows that SBI and Kotak Mahindra Bank are in the testing mode. SBI’s participation is also key because it will open the window for a huge pool of the bank’s customers to use the AA framework and allow easy access to financial services.

The bank is also working on the infrastructure needed to manage and share the huge pool of data it possesses. Since the data has to be accessed from the core banking system, it will require additional levels of security and audits.

“The exact viable business model is yet to be identified. SBI acknowledges that they have a huge role to play as the largest bank in the country. Ultimately it will be a positive for them as well because the largest providers also end up being the largest users of data. It’s far more efficient and saves a lot of costs,” said Perfios’ Rajagopalan.

However, with the framework still at nascent stages, the overall value proposition for large banks is still getting proven. Once there is enough data on usage of the framework, it will become clearer how big banks are set to also benefit as users of data, Rajagopalan said.

The RBI, too, is keeping a close watch on this and may intervene only if the pace does not pick up after some more time has passed.

“From our conversations with the RBI, we understand that if most banks don’t go live after a certain point, then the regulator may consider making it mandatory for all banks to share data through AAs,” said the executive quoted above.

Six banks are live on the ecosystem, including Axis Bank, Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank and IndusInd bank. Eleven more NBFCs and investment advisors too are live as FIPs and FIUs."

The RBI on Tuesday said state-owned SBI, along with private sector lenders ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank continue to be Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) or institutions which are 'too big to fail'.

SIBs are perceived as banks that are 'too big to fail (TBTF)'. This perception of TBTF creates an expectation of government support for these banks in times of distress. Due to this perception, these lenders enjoy certain advantages in the funding markets.

''SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank continue to be identified as Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs), under the same bucketing structure as in the 2020 list of D-SIBs,'' the Reserve Bank said in a statement.

The additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) requirement for D-SIBs was phased-in from April 1, 2016 and became fully effective from April 1, 2019.

The additional CET1 requirement will be in addition to the capital conservation buffer.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had announced SBI and ICICI Bank as D-SIBs in 2015 and 2016.

Based on data collected from banks as on March 31, 2017, HDFC Bank was also classified as a D-SIB.

The current update is based on data collected from banks as on March 31, 2021.

The framework for dealing with D-SIBs was issued in July 2014.

The framework requires the RBI to disclose the names of banks designated as D-SIBs starting from 2015 and place these lenders in appropriate buckets depending upon their Systemic Importance Scores (SISs).

Based on the bucket in which a D-SIB is placed, an additional common equity requirement has to be applied to it.

The Additional Common Equity Tier 1 requirement as a percentage of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) in case of SBI is 0.6 per cent, and 0.2 per cent for ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank."

For IMPS transactions conducted through bank branches, new slab of Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh has been added for levying service charge. ""The proposed service charges for this slab is Rs 20 + GST,"" SBI said, adding that this directive will come into effect from February 1, 2022.

State Bank of India (SBI), the country's largest public sector bank, has made a $20-million investment in the merchant platform company, Pine Labs said on January 4.

Commenting on the fundraise, B Amrish Rau, CEO of Pine Labs, said “In the last one year, several marquee investors have placed their trust in our business model and growth momentum and that is a gratifying feeling. This association with SBI is a personally satisfying experience as I had started my career selling financial services technology to SBI.”

In 2021, Pine Labs raked in a total of $700 million across two rounds of fundraising. The first $600 million was raised in July 2021 at a valuation of $3 billion led by Fidelity, Blackrock and other investors.

In September 2021, the company announced it has raised $100 million more from US-based investment management company Invesco. The investment was done through the Invesco Developing Markets Fund.

The company, which provides merchant payment, PoS, and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) solutions, is also backed by Sequoia Capital, Temasek Holdings, Actis, PayPal, and Mastercard amongst other global investors.

Pine Labs is working on expanding its BNPL business across India and Southeast Asia and entered the consumer payment space with its April 2021 acquisition of Fave.

In October last year, Pine Labs forayed into the online payments space with a payment gateway platform named Plural.

Plural is expected to make the offline-to-online transition easier for Pine Labs’ merchant base and is aimed towards merchants and enterprises looking to set up afresh or augment their existing online commerce business.

SBI's last investment in a fintech company was in digital payments platform Cashfree in June 2021.

The public sector bank's investment comes ahead of Pine Labs' planned IPO, for which the company is reported to have appointed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as advisors. It is eyeing a valuation of $6 billion through the IPO.

In an interview with Moneycontrol in April 2021, Rau had revealed that Pine Labs had been in touch with law firms, auditors, and bankers for a year, but has not yet decided on when it will list.

Founded in 1998, Pine Labs processes payments worth $30 million in a year. It serves over 150,000 merchants in 3,700 cities across Asia and the Middle East. It has also enabled its BNPL credit service to 150,000 outlets."

The year 2021 will be memorable for many reasons. One of the best examples is this year’s record-breaking stock market performance – 65 companies went public and the benchmark indices skyrocketed, with the BSE Sensex crossing the 50,000 mark for the first time.

With stocks booming, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the market regulator, had its hands full over the past 12 months, changing norms to strengthen the system and make it fairer and more transparent for investors.

A look back at SEBI’s notable decisions taken at its six board meetings over the year.

IPO reforms, mutual fund regulations, NII allocations - December 28

At its last board meeting of 2021, Sebi amended mutual fund regulations, tweaked allocations for non-institutional investors (NIIs) and fine-tuned rules for initial public offerings.

IPO reforms

The board amended the norms for making an offer for sale during an IPO. As per the new rules, shareholders with more than 20 percent of the pre-issue shareholding cannot sell more than half their stake during an IPO. An investor with a less than 20 percent stake cannot sell more than 10 percent of the pre-issue shareholding of the issuer.

The regulator increased the lock-in period for anchor investors. For 50 percent of the portion allocated to anchor investors, a lock-in of 90 days from the date of allotment will apply for issues opening on or after April 1, 2022, Sebi said in a press release. The existing lock-in of 30 days will continue for the remaining 50 percent.

The board tightened the amount that companies can raise for the future, as yet unidentified acquisitions or investment targets. In the case of book-built issues, a minimum price band of at least 105 percent of the floor price will apply for all issues opening on or after notification.

NII allocation norms

The regulator revised the allocation norms for non-institutional investors. From April 1, 2022, for book-built issues, two-thirds of the portion available for NIIs will be reserved for those applying for more than Rs 10 lakh of shares, while the remainder will be for those bidding for shares worth Rs 2 lakh to Rs 10 lakh.

Mutual fund regulation

The board made it mandatory for trustees of a mutual fund to obtain the consent of a majority of unitholders for winding up a scheme. Sebi approved a mandate for mutual funds to follow the Indian Accounting Standard from FY24.

Superior voting rights, SSE framework, silver ETFs - September 28

Sebi proposed to ease rules related to superior voting rights, approved the creation of the Social Stock Exchange, and introduced silver exchange-traded funds, among other decisions.

Superior voting rights

Sebi said at its meeting that promoters with a net worth of up to Rs 1,000 crore could have superior voting rights in their companies, increasing the threshold from Rs 500 crore.

Social stock exchange

The board approved the creation of the SSE for fundraising by social enterprises. The SSE framework was developed based on the recommendations of a working group and a technical group constituted by the market regulator.

Silver exchange-traded funds

The board approved the amendment to the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, to allow silver ETFs under safeguards similar to those governing gold ETFs under the existing regulatory framework.

FPI constituents

To facilitate investment in the Indian securities markets through the foreign portfolio investment (FPI) route, the board permitted resident Indians (other than individuals) to become constituents of FPIs that are registered as alternative investment funds in International Financial Services Centres.

IPO reforms, relaxation of disclosure requirements - August 6

Sebi decided to reform IPO rules and simplify requirements for group company disclosures.

IPO reforms

Sebi amended the lock-in period for an issue that involves an offer for sale or financing, other than for capital expenditure for a project. The minimum promoters’ contribution of 20 percent, in such cases, should be locked in for 18 months from the date of allotment in the IPO and follow-on public offer. Currently, the lock-in period is three years.

In all these cases, the promoter shareholding above the minimum contribution will be locked in for six months instead of the existing one year. Sebi decided on several amendments in IPO norms, which it stated in a press release.

Relaxed disclosure requirements

The board approved ways to reduce disclosure requirements during an IPO. The measures include rationalising the definition of the promoter group where the promoter of the issuer company is a corporate body to exclude companies that have the same financial investors. The board agreed to shift from the concept of a promoter to ‘person in control’ or ‘controlling shareholders.’

In addition, the disclosure requirements in the offer documents in respect of the issuer company’s group entities should be rationalised to exclude disclosure of the financials of the top 5 listed or unlisted group companies. These disclosures will continue to be made available on the website of the group companies.

IDs, InvITs, REITs; insider trading informant rewards - June 29

The regulator amended regulations for independent directors, changed the criteria for infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) and real estate investment trusts (REITs), and increased rewards for insider trading informants.

Appointing IDs

Appointments, reappointments, and removal of independent directors must be made through a special resolution of shareholders for all listed entities. Sebi elaborated on the appointment process of independent directors to be followed by the nomination and remuneration committee, ordering a modification in the committee. Several amendments mentioned in Sebi’s press release come into effect from January 1, 2022.

Relaxed REIT, InvIT rules

The board revised the minimum application value to be in the range of Rs 10,000-15,000 from Rs 1 lakh and its multiples previously and revised the trading lot to one unit for REITs and InvITS. It also relaxed norms for unlisted REITs and InvITs tapping the bond market.

Accredited investors

The board approved a proposal to introduce a framework for accredited investors, a class of investors who may be considered well-informed or well-advised about investment products.

Informant rewards

The regulator increased the reward amount payable to informants under insider-trading rules to Rs 10 crore from Rs 1 crore, a much-awaited decision as the earlier amount appeared ineffective.

Delisting rules, sustainability reporting, startups - March 25

Sebi approved a raft of measures, including making delisting of shares more transparent and efficient, requiring companies to disclose sustainability issues, and making the public offering of startups easier.

The regulator mandated the public disclosure of analyst calls, quick reporting of earnings, and expanded the requirement of setting up a risk management committee to the top 1,000 listed companies by market capitalisation from 500 listed entities previously.

Delisting norms

Under the new norms, a promoter or acquirer must disclose the intention to delist by making an initial public announcement. It introduced and revised timelines for various activities involved in delisting, the introduction of a committee of independent directors for recommendations, and the specification of an indicative delisting price not less than the floor price.

Innovators growth

Sebi cut the period for issuers to have 25 percent of pre-issue capital held by eligible investors from two years to one year, which was significant demand from startups.

Reclassification of promoters

The Sebi board acted on a long-pending demand of corporate houses. It changed the requirement of approval from shareholders in cases where the promoter seeking reclassification holds less than 1 percent of the shares, subject to the promoter not being in control.

The board introduced new requirements for sustainability reporting by listed entities. The new report will be called the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report and will replace the previous Business Responsibility Report. The new report will lay emphasis on quantifiable metrics, which allow for easy measurement and comparability across companies, sectors and time periods.

This report by Moneycontrol has details on Sebi’s decisions at the meeting.

Ease for large issues - February 17

Sebi took significant decisions at its first board meeting for 2021. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman customarily addressed the board after the budget presentation in Parliament.

Change in IPO norms

The regulator approved changes in the norms for IPOs to allow a smaller float for large companies. The board recommended that for issuers with a post-issue market capital exceeding Rs 1 lakh crore, the requirement of the minimum public offer will be cut from 10 percent of the post-issue market capital to Rs 10,000 crore plus 5 percent of the incremental amount beyond Rs 1 lakh crore.

These issuers must achieve at least 10 percent public shareholding in two years and at least 25 percent public shareholding within five years of listing.

As a result of amendments in IPO norms, the dilution requirement for post-issue capitalisation of over Rs 4,000 crore was lowered to 5 percent from 10 percent previously, as per Sebi’s press release.

Ease of doing business

To promote ease of doing business, Sebi approved the merger of the Regulatory Fee on Stock Exchanges Regulations, 2006, with the Securities Contracts (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations) Regulations, 2018.

Amending the regulations, the board noted that the post-graduate programme in equity markets of not less than one year offered by NISM is an eligible qualification for portfolio managers, investment advisers, and research analysts.

Budget announcements such as gold spot exchange, investor charter, and securities code were also discussed."

The State Bank of India (SBI) has acquired a minority stake in JSW Cement Limited, part of USD 13 billion JSW Group.

The PSU Banking behemoth has invested Rs 100 crore in the company via compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS), a JSW Cement statement said on Tuesday.

""The conversion of such CCPS into common equity of the company will be linked to the company’s future business performance and valuation determined at the time of the proposed initial public offering"", it said.

This capital infusion will support JSW Cement’s capacity expansion from current 14 MTPA to 25 MTPA, the statement added.

The SBI transaction with JSW Cement comes close on the heels of the Rs 1,500 crore investments made by two global private equity investors, Apollo Global Management Inc. (through its investment entity in Singapore) and Synergy Metals Investments Holding Ltd earlier this year.

Managing Director of JSW Cement, Parth Jindal, said: In a short span of three years, we have increased our capacity from 6 MTPA to 14 MTPA and are now working towards achieving the 25 MTPA milestone over the next 24 months.

Country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has increased benchmark lending rate or base rate by 0.1 percent, a move that may be followed by other lenders.

With the increase the revised base rate is 7.55 percent, as per the information posted on SBI’s website.

The new rate is effective from December 15, 2021, it said. The decision is not going to affect those who have taken loan since January 2019 but those before that.

SBI has migrated to External Benchmark Lending Rate (EBLR) linked to repo rate since January 2019. There is no change in EBLR rate and this rate changes with change in benchmark interest rate of Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

In the December monetary policy, RBI decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 4 percent.

This was the ninth time in a row when the central bank decided to maintain the status quo on benchmark lending rate to support growth rate.

The bank has also revised the benchmark prime lending rate to 12.3 percent from 12.2 percent. With regard to domestic term deposits, the bank has decided to raise it by 0.1 percent for high value deposits over Rs 2 crore.

""Adoption of digital payments for the first 100 million-plus people in UPI has been a global success story. We hope that WhatsApp can help take that story to the next level by helping onboard the next 500 million people, who are at the bottom of the pyramid and can benefit the most,"" Bose said speaking at the Digital Money conference by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI).

Currently, WhatsApp is allowed to onboard only 40 million UPI users and its share in monthly volumes remains at a minuscule 0.06 percent. However, since the Meta (erstwhile Facebook) owned company doubled down on growing its UPI user base, transaction volumes and values have been growing with every month.

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) which is the umbrella organisation that handles UPI transactions allowed WhatsApp to increase its UPI user base cap from 20 million to 40 million only in November 2021. Moneycontrol was the first to report that NPCI will hike the cap in a phased manner.

WhatsApp's transactions consistently doubled in September and October after the company made its UPI feature more prominent in the app with a rupee icon in the chat composer and extended the feature to more users.

The instant messaging app has over 400 million users in India which is its largest market globally. Bose added that one of WhatsApp's key objectives is digitisation especially for small and medium businesses and other underserved sectors.

""We can help scale financial inclusion, as people will be able to get access to microfinance digital banking services that they didn't have. For the first time in a long time, we as a society, have the ability to significantly democratise access (of financial services) in the economy through technology,"" he added.

Bose also spoke about how private, small finance and cooperative banks have deployed mobile banking services through WhatsApp.

""In 2021, we have also seen growth in pilots that were launched. People can now access and purchase health insurance from State Bank of India (SBI), as well as sign up for micro pensions from the National Pension Scheme (NPS).""

Payments and online banking solutions company Cashfree Payments said on November 30 that it has made a $15 million investment in Telr, a Dubai-based payment service provider.

The investment makes Cashfree the largest shareholder in Telr and will help the company strengthen its presence in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region as the company sets out on a course to expand its presence in global markets.

In an interview with Moneycontrol, Akash Sinha, co-founder of Cashfree Payments said that what prompted this investment was the large and growing market opportunity that the MENA region offers with only two percent of retail sales happening online currently.

“The landscape for online transactions is changing fast after the pandemic. Plus, Telr already has a partnership with over eight banks. So, it made sense to join hands with Telr to try and become the top payment service provider in the MENA region in the coming years,” Sinha said.

Founded in 2015 by IIIT Hyderabad alumnus Sinha and IIT Kharagpur graduate Reeju Datta, Cashfree Payments processes transactions worth $20 billion annually in India. With over 1,00,000 merchants on its platform, the company’s offerings include payment gateway, a split payment solution for marketplaces, bank account verification Application Programming Interface (API) and Auto Collect which enables merchants to collect payments from customers via various payment modes.

In the payment gateway space, the Bengaluru-based company competes with players like PayU, Paytm, Razorpay among others.

With Telr, the company will launch its products in the MENA region and will also develop a unified cross-border payments platform to help Indian merchants accept payments from customers in the MENA region and vice-versa. Currently Cashfree products are already used in the UAE, besides USA and Canada.

“Usually geographical expansion for a company like ours will mean reworking our payments partners in the new markets. Our intention with this partnership is to integrate the cash flow here in India and make a seamless transition globally through the partnership. This saves us a lot of time and energy,” Sinha added.

Telr handles payments in over 120 currencies and 30 languages and enables payments through Visa, Mastercard, American Express, UnionPay, Apple Pay, PayPal, SADAD, Mada and STCPay.

Financial services play

Cashfree has also launched products for Banking As A Service (BaaS), i.e. it is providing an integrated interface that can serve as a common platform for upcoming neobanks to provide banking products from its partners to customers.

Telr’s offerings, too, cover financial and business services including social commerce, QR Codes, digital invoicing, Telr Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), a merchant financing platform named Telr Finance and Telr Shops, a tool for creating an online store.

“Cashfree too has a couple of lending products for merchants who use our payment solutions. We are working on a product which will allow merchants to take short-term loans from us which can be repaid within one to two months,” Sinha explained.

Funding plans

Cashfree Payments was incubated by California-headquartered online payments leader PayPal and is backed by Silicon Valley investor Y Combinator, Apis Partners and India’s largest public sector bank State Bank of India (SBI).

SBI made the investment in June this year with reports pegging Cashfree’s post-money valuation during the investment at $200 million.

“We are well-capitalised now. But we continue to be in active discussions for further funding. We will seek more funds at the right time,” Sinha said."

“There has been a news article on 22.11.2021 that SBI is not refunding charges recovered from the customers on digital transactions. We confirm that Bank is in full compliance with the Government and regulatory directives in this regard,"" the bank said in a statement.

According to a report prepared by IIT Bombay Professor Ashish Das, the SBI has refunded only Rs 90 crore so far out of the transaction fee levied on account holders of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) scheme.

""On directions from the government, SBI has returned just about Rs 90 crore, thereby withholding the bigger chunk of at least Rs 164 crore with itself,"" the report claimed.

Since June 1, 2017, unlike any other bank in India, the report said, SBI had charged Rs 17.70 for every debit transaction beyond four a month.

Debit transaction means any withdrawal transaction that includes cash withdrawal, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Immediate Payment Service (IMPS), National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT), Real-time Gross Settlement (RTGS), pre-authorised standing instruction and cheque.

On August 30, 2020, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) advised banks to refund the charges collected since January 1, 2020, on transactions carried out using the prescribed digital payment modes that include the UPI and the RuPay debit card, and not to impose charges on future transactions carried out through such modes.

The SBI, in its statement, said it has implemented the changes as directed by the central tax body. ""SBI has made all digital transactions free to the FI (Financial Inclusion) customers w.e.f. 01.01.2020. Further, up to four cash withdrawals in a month are free. Fully free digital transactions and four free cash withdrawals are enabling these customers to meet all their banking requirements,"" it said.

The bank further added that it has been at the ""forefront of the Financial Inclusion initiative of the Government of India"" and has an estimated FI customer base of 13.76 crore.

November is the most crucial month for pensioners as they need to submit documents reconfirming their status to keep the pension running. Non-submission of Life Certificate leads to stoppage of pension disbursement.

India’s largest lender the State Bank of India (SBI) has relaxed the process of submitting life certificate for pensioners.

Pensioners need to submit their life certificates by end of November every year either online or by visiting their bank branch.

SBI had explained a step-by-step process through which the pensioners can submit their life certificates through a video call from the comfort of their homes.

“We believe this facility will digitally empower pensioners and enable them to submit their life certificates without any hassle of visiting the branch amid COVID-19,” SBI Chairman Dinesh Khara said in a statement.

In case of rejection, you will be informed by the bank via SMS and alternatively, you can visit your pension-paying branch or the nearest branch for submission of your life certificate.

Here’s how the new service works for SBI pension accountholders:

- Open the SBI Pension Seva Portal.

- Click on ‘VideoLC’ to initiate the VLC process.

- Enter your SBI Pension Account Number and enter the one-time password (OTP) received on your registered mobile number.

- Read and accept the ‘Terms & Conditions’ and click on ‘Start Journey’.

- Keep your PAN Card handy and click on ‘I am Ready’.

- Allow permission to start the video call and your interaction will begin as soon as an SBI official is available.

- You can also set a schedule to interact according to your convenience.

- The available SBI official will ask you to read out a 4-digit verification code on your screen.

- Now show your PAN Card to the official and allow him or her to capture it.

- Now the official will capture your picture and the Video Life Certificate (VLC) will be complete."

These charges are over and above the interest charges for converting the purchase into EMIs. The company informed its customers about the new charge by email (refer to image).

Processing charges

The processing charges apply to transactions successfully converted into EMIs. Any transaction done before December 1, with the EMI booking occurring after December 1, will be exempted from this processing fee. The company will intimate the applicability of the processing fees on EMI transactions to cardholders via charge slips while shopping at retail outlets. For online EMI transactions, it will intimate processing charges on the payment page. The processing fees will be reversed in case the EMI transaction gets canceled. However, the same will not be reversed in the case of pre-closure. Reward points will not apply for transactions converted into merchant EMIs.

A retail banker requesting anonymity says, “These processing charges from SBICPSL are as per industry standards. Other leading private banks have been charging these fees for a long time.”

How does it work?

Assume you buy some consumer electronics using SBI credit card from one of the e-commerce websites under its EMI scheme. Then SBICPSL charges you Rs 99 as processing fees plus applicable taxes. This will be reflected in your monthly credit card statement along with the EMI amount.

Cash-strapped telecom operator Vodafone Idea, now known as Vi, is in talks with the State Bank of India (SBI) for fresh loans, Bloomberg reported.

Citing sources aware of the development, the report stated that India’s largest lender has asked the telecom company to prepare a turnaround strategy and present detailed plans on Vi's financial viability including equity infusion, cash conservation plans and revenue and profitability outlook.

The debt-laden telecom company is preparing the information, however, there is no assurance yet that it will be able to secure loans from the bank, according to the report.

Vi has total Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues worth Rs 58,254 crore as assessed by the Department of Telecom. Its Rs 1.9 lakh crore debt pile includes spectrum obligations amounting to Rs 94,200 crore. Analysts estimate around Rs 2,000 crore of finance charges to be added to Vodafone Idea’s annual interest payments.

Fresh loans from SBI will act as a vote of confidence for other lenders as well.

India, the world's second-largest telecom market and the biggest consumer of data, has three private players -- Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vi -- besides the state-owned operators BSNL/MTNL.

Amid an existential crisis faced by Vi, the government recently approved a blockbuster relief package for the sector that includes a four-year break for companies from paying statutory dues, permission to share scarce airwaves, change in the definition of revenue on which levies are paid, and 100 percent foreign investment through the automatic route.

Vi on October 20 announced that its board has opted for the four-year moratorium to clear AGR dues. The company will clear the dues, spectrum payment over four years starting October 2021 and ending September 2025.

The measures, aimed at providing relief to companies such as Vi that have to pay thousands of crores in unprovisioned past statutory dues, also include the scrapping of Spectrum Usage Charge (SUC) for airwaves acquired in future spectrum auctions."

A Jaisalmer court on November 9 granted bail to former State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Pratip Chaudhuri in an alleged loan scam case.

The bail comes over a week after Chaudhuri was sent to a 14-day judicial custody in connection with the case which involves the sale of a hotel belonging to the Godawan Group in Jaisalmer -- which is a non-performing asset (NPA) -- to Alchemist ARC in an alleged fraudulent manner.

Chaudhuri's plea seeking bail was heard by Additional District and Sessions Judge Dalpat Singh Rajpurohit.

The former banker had been arrested on October 31 from his residence in Delhi. The case against him was registered in 2015 for seizing the hotel property in a loan settlement case and allegedly selling it at a throwaway price.

Chaudhuri later became a director on the board of Alchemist ARC, the company which purchased the hotel, the prosecution said.

Notably, the ex-SBI chief was taken into arrest following a petition filed by former directors of the hotel property with the Chief Judicial Magistrate - Jaisalmer.

The ex-directors accused him of facilitating the sale of the Rs 200-crore property at a price of Rs 25 crore to Alchemist ARC, after the SBI had seized the hotel following a default on loan.

The petitioners claimed that the Godawan properties’ NPA was assigned to Alchemist Asset Reconstruction Company in 2014, six months after Chaudhuri resigned as the SBI chairman and joined the board of Alchemist ARC.

Refuting claims of cutting a sweetheart deal, the SBI has said in a statement that due process as per the bank’s policy was followed during the NPA loan account sale to Alchemist ARC. “It appears from the copies of the proceedings now accessed by us that there have been some factual inaccuracies in the complainant’s version submitted to the Hon’ble court,” the bank said.

It further stated that the ‘Garh Rajwada’ hotel in Jaisalmer, which was financed by the SBI in 2007, had remained incomplete for more than three years. After the main promoter passed away in the year 2010, it had turned into a non-performing asset by June 2010.

India is ready to move into the next orbit of growth with the hugely successful implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program, State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said on Saturday.

The kind of vaccine drive the country has seen makes all the Indians proud, especially because the domestically produced vaccine is being used in a big way, Khara said at the India Pavilion at EXPO2020 Dubai.

""Actually, it (rapid vaccination) has enhanced the confidence level of the common man as well as the economy,” he said.

India recently achieved a major milestone in its vaccination programme against COVID-19 as the cumulative vaccine doses administered in the country surpassed the 100-crore mark.

""The country has lived through one of the most challenging times and has come out of it in a very successful manner that gives the confidence that going forward, the journey should be rather easy, and we should be having a huge opportunity for growth… which I am sure will go a long way in terms of meeting the common man’s aspirations,” he said.

The credit growth in the economy was quite muted for almost two years, he said, expressing hope that the capacity utilisation will improve, and help revive investment demand in the corporate sector.

""The government has done a wonderful job by continuing its focus on infrastructure investment, which has gone a long way in terms of giving a push to the core sectors of the economy. And with private corporate sectors coming with the investment, the economy will certainly move to the next orbit of development,” he added.

On the India Pavilion, Khara said it is presenting the real India, which is full of opportunities, to the whole world in an impressive manner."

The Chief Judicial Magistrate’s court here rejected his bail plea. “We have presented former SBI chairman Pratip Chaudhari before the court from where he was sent to judicial custody today,” Jaisalmer Sadar SHO Karan Singh said.

Garh Rajwada, a hotel project in Jaisalmer, was financed by the bank in 2007, the SBI said in a statement. The project remained incomplete for over three years and the account slipped into a non-performing asset (NPA) in 2010, it stated.

Police said a case was registered against Chaudhari in 2015 for allegedly seizing the premier hotel property in the loan settlement case and selling it at a throwaway price through fraudulent means to an asset reconstruction company (ARC).

They said Chaudhari later joined as a director of the board of the company that had bought the hotel.

In its statement, the SBI said that all due process was followed while making the sale. The bank claimed that the court does not appear to have been briefed correctly on the sequence of events.

It said that SBI was not a party to the case and there was no occasion for the views of the bank being heard as part of the proceedings in court. The bank has offered its cooperation with law enforcement and judicial authorities and will provide further information, if required, the statement said.

All the directors of the ARC, including Chaudhuri, who joined their board in 2014, have been named in the case, SBI said. He had retired from the bank’s service in September 2013, the statement added.

Several people from the banking community, including previous chiefs of the bank, have made their reactions public, Khara said while addressing the media after the bank's quarterly results announcement.

""It appears that he was not given an opportunity to be heard before issuing the arrest warrant,"" Khara said.

Chaudhari was arrested by Jaisalmer Police on Sunday in a case associated with Gaudavan Group and Alchemist ARC. The group had taken a loan of Rs 24 crore to construct a new hotel. According to a TOI report, allegations against Chaudhuri included facilitating the sale of properties worth Rs 200 crore for Rs 25 crore to the ARC, after the bank seized them for defaulting on loan.

The SBI in a recent statement had said that there were factual inaccuracies in the complaint lodged against the former chairman.

Khara added that the bank has utmost faith in the country's judicial system and is confident that Chaudhari will be released unconditionally.

The banking community through IBA has taken up the matter with government authorities and it hopes that this matter will resolved soon, he said.

Khara added that, as far as the bank is concerned, there has been no irregularity in the said case, and that all prescribed rules and processes were followed by the bank.

Issues of this magnitude are invariably dealt with at the local level, and top management of the bank including the chairman isn’t involved in the decision making.

""As we have got a structure in place, we are confident that all our people across the hierarchy can take decisions,"" Khara added.

The arrest of the former SBI chairman had drawn reactions from former SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar and veteran banker Uday Kotak, among others.

Kumar in an exclusive chat to Moneycontrol had said “This seems to be a case of highly motivated, high-handed action. This seems to be an error of judgment. There is a due process and set of rules laid out by the RBI for the sale of assets to ARCs. Where is the corruption here?”

The rise of Jet Airways symbolized a remarkable achievement for its promoter, Naresh Goyal, an erstwhile travel agent with an affable personality, who had made it big in the airline business through the sheer dint of his enterprise and hard work. Way back in 2010 or 2011, when I was heading the UK Operations of SBI, I had come across both Vijay Mallya and Naresh Goyal at a social event in London. The two were contrasting personalities—one was rich, flamboyant, and ostentatious while the other was a low-profile businessman, perhaps not highly educated but a very amicable person. In fact, looking at him, one could hardly believe that he was the man instrumental in creating such a successful airline in terms of both adroit branding and high-quality service. I have flown almost all major airlines across the globe, and found Jet to be a perfect match for many of the best international airlines like Emirates, Korean Air of South Korea, Lufthansa, and Singapore Airlines. For Indians, Jet offered another unique selling proposition—a familiar and comfortable environment stemming from its typical ‘Indianness’. However, I soon learnt that trouble was brewing in this apparent paradise.

From the archive: Jet Airways employees write to SBI, offer to take over airline

The Beginning of the End for Jet Airways

In the middle of 2019, Naresh Goyal and one of the topmost investment bankers hired by Jet Airways reached out to SBI for sanction of additional loans. The loans were to be secured by the pledge of shares of JP Miles, a frequent flyer programme being offered by the airline but which was managed by a separate company that Jet jointly owned with Etihad Airways. The valuation being talked about for this financial deal was in excess of US$1 billion. While Jet was holding shares worth 49.9 per cent, the remaining 51.1 per cent were held by Etihad. It was obvious that Jet was facing shortage of working capital funds. My first intuitive reaction was that SBI should stay away from Jet’s woes rather than enter into its messy financial waters. My perception seemed justified as subsequently many issues unfolded with regard to the valuation of Jet Privilege Private Limited pertaining to JP Miles, being closely held as also because its valuation would be inextricably linked with the performance of Jet Airways.

Another proposal suggested for resolving the issue was that of financing against six Boeing 777, three Boeing 737 and three Airbus planes owned by Jet. Since SBI had no experience of financing aircraft, this proposal too could not be carried further and the company was advised to explore funding from other banks that had some understanding of financing aircraft. Meanwhile, the financial problems being faced by the company became more and more evident. The investment bankers concerned had probably underestimated the common sense and intelligence of officials at public sector banks, who were assumed to provide assistance without giving much thought to the issue.

Word of trouble at Jet Airways soon spread in the public domain. Jet’s problems had started with the acquisition of Sahara Airlines, as a result of which it ended up managing two brands for many years, one of which was a premium full-service carrier while the other was a budget airline that had somehow diluted the original Jet brand. The company was thus falling apart because of its inability to compete with budget airlines, and Indigo had rapidly started capturing the market share. There was huge pressure on the revenue per seat kilometre for Jet whereas its cost per seat kilometre was substantially higher that of other budget airlines. Governance at Jet was reportedly poor amid allegations that the CEO and the management were not being given due authority to run the airline professionally.

Mistrust between Partners

Later on, I realized that the bigger problem, which had beset the company, was a complete lack of trust between the two partners, Jet and Etihad. In 2013, Jet had brought in Etihad as a joint venture partner with a 24 per cent stake. Further, it sold a 50.1 per cent stake in Jet Privilege to Etihad, and went on to sell its three slots at Heathrow Airport in London, with the right to buy them back after three years for US$70 million. Etihad had arranged funding from one of the bankers of Etihad, which was to be reportedly secured by pledging shares held by Jet Airways. In hindsight, it appeared, at least to me, that Naresh Goyal had got a raw deal and had effectively mortgaged the interest of Jet Airways, considering that the agreement between Etihad and Jet Airways had opened up a huge and attractive market of Indian flyers for global players like Etihad by an increase in its revenue. As the obvious mistrust between the two partners became public knowledge, it started becoming evident that one of the major irritants was the non-perfection of security on the shares of Jet Airways. Etihad had guaranteed its repayment. Under the rules, foreigners are not allowed to hold more than a 49 per cent share in an airline, and it was not clear if this rule applied to the Jet Privilege wherein Etihad had a 50.1 per cent stake. Since no clarification on the issue came from the MoCA, Etihad started believing that Naresh Goyal was using his influence with MoCA to prevent it from issuing the clarification.

Tony Douglas, the CEO of Etihad, flew down to Mumbai in October 2018, after Naresh Goyal had met me. The visit by Douglas underscored the seriousness of the situation. Jet was fast running out of cash and hurtling towards an imminent shutdown unless a major infusion of cash happened. Tony wanted SBI to invest in Jet Privilege, against security of Jet’s shareholding in Jet Privilege, following which Etihad was willing to take over the operations without any financial commitment in case of an emergency.

The country's largest lender SBI on Monday said it has raised Rs 6,000 crore by issuing Basel III compliant bonds.

In June, the bank had received approval from its central board for raising fresh additional tier 1 (AT 1) capital of up to Rs 14,000 crore.

The committee of directors for capital raising at its meeting on October 18, 2021, accorded its approval to allot 6,000 Basel III compliant fully paid-up debt instruments in the nature of debentures qualifying as AT 1 capital of the bank to bond subscribers, SBI said in a regulatory filing.

The non-convertible, taxable, perpetual, subordinated, unsecured bonds of the face value of Rs 1 crore each aggregates to Rs 6,000 crore.

The bonds bear a coupon of 7.72 per cent per annum payable annually, SBI said.

Perpetual bonds carry no maturity date, so they may be treated as equity, not as debt.

The violation is related to rules pertaining to frauds classification and reporting by commercial banks and select financial institutions, the RBI said.

This action is based on the deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers, the central bank said in a release.

The RBI conducted scrutiny of the bank in a customer account maintained with the bank and the examination of the scrutiny report revealed non-compliance with the directions on reporting of fraud in the said account to RBI, the central bank said.

“In furtherance to the same, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause why penalty should not be imposed on it for such non-compliance with the said directions,” the RBI said.

After considering SBI’s reply, the RBI came to the conclusion that the charge of non-compliance with the aforesaid RBI directions was substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty, the RBI said.

Earlier, the RBI announced a fine of Rs 1.95 crore on the Standard Chartered Bank for failing to report a cyber security incident within the prescribed time period, and failure to credit the amount involved in unauthorised electronic transactions, among other reasons.

Listing the reasons behind the move, the RBI said in a release that it imposed a penalty of Rs 1.95 crore on the Standard Chartered Bank over non-compliance with the directions issued by it regarding “customer protection”.

The RBI’s enforcement operations are conducted by the Enforcement Department. The RBI’s EFD was set up in April 2017 to separate enforcement action from the supervisory process. EFD identifies actionable violations from the inspection reports, risk assessment reports, and scrutiny reports.

Market intelligence reports, references from the top management, and complaints are also used for investigation. An Adjudication Committee then adjudicates the violations and determines the quantum of the penalty.

The penalty thus imposed would be disclosed by RBI in the form of a press release and by the regulated entity as per the disclosure norms. The regulated entity will then be required to pay the penalty within a specific period."

The unique infrastructure at naval ships inhibits traditional payment solutions particularly when the ship is on high seas where there is no connectivity. NAV-eCash Card with its dual-chip technology will facilitate both online as well as offline transactions.

The Card will obviate the difficulties faced by personnel onboard in handling physical cash during deployment of the ship at high seas. The idea of such a card was jointly nurtured by SBI and Navy officials and the card takes care of the requirements of the Navy to provide a seamless onboard experience.

The country's banking sector needs to be scaled up with four to five lenders of the size of State Bank of India (SBI), the country's largest state-run lender, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on September 26.

""We need to scale up banking. The need is for at least four-five more SBI-sized banks,"" Sitharaman said while speaking at the 74th Annual General Meeting of Indian Banks' Association in Mumbai.

A larger number of lenders, particularly the big-sized banks, will aid in the path of making a smart recovery post-pandemic disruptions, she added.

Sitharaman said there was an urgent need to scale up banking to not only meet the growing needs of the industry, but also to ensure that all economic centres of the country are covered with at least one physical or digital banking presence.

The finance minister referred to the amalgamation exercise among public sector banks, which, she said, have helped in moving ahead with the creation of large banks.

Having done two rounds of bank consolidation earlier, the central government in 2019 decided to merge six disparate and weak PSBs into four in one stroke.

Accordingly, Punjab National Bank (PNB) took over Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India; Allahabad Bank became part of Indian Bank; Canara Bank subsumed Syndicate Bank; and Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank merged with Union Bank of India. Earlier, State Bank of India (SBI) merged five of its associate banks with itself while Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank were merged with Bank of Baroda.

Sitharaman lauded the efforts of the PSBs to see through that the amalgamation of banks during the pandemic period was completed without any inconvenience to customers.

She said that in the post-pandemic world, banks would need to change their mindset and the way they conduct their businesses.

Digitisation, the finance minister said has changed a lot of how businesses are done and banks will now need to think futuristically and keep pace with evolving technology.

Sitharaman also asked the IBA to conduct a digitised mapping of each district of the country with regard to the presence of bank branch operation and their location. This, she said, would help to plug areas of gaps with no banking presence effectively.

""Not necessary to have physical banking presence everywhere. The country's optic fibre network has covered two-third of about 7.5 lakh panchayats. This could be used to deliver banking services in unconnected areas as well,"" the finance minister said.

She also asked banks to develop models and better understanding of businesses focused on exports as the country has set a $2 trillion export target by 2030.

With regard to funding for the infra sector, she said that a government sector development financial institution (DFI) is coming up soon.

Sitharaman said that the Indian economy is at a critical stage of a reset and banks would form the backbone for it by providing best of the financial services.

India's residential property market is expected to witness a strong consumer demand during the festival season with various banks, including SBI, providing concessional interest rates on home loans, according to real estate developers and consultants.

They also hoped that other public and private banks would soon announce their festival offers on interest rates on home loans and processing fees. On Thursday, the country's largest lender State Bank of India announced various festive offers for prospective home loan customers, including a credit score-linked home loan starting at 6.70 per cent, irrespective of the loan amount. Earlier, a borrower availing a home loan above Rs 75 lakh had to pay an interest rate of 7.15 per cent.

ALSO READ: SBI to offer home loans at 6.70% irrespective of the loan amount

Anarock group Chairman Anuj Puri said: ""This is an extremely competitive move by SBI, and it virtually negates all the previous limitations which applied to special home loan interest rates. Instead of focussing on just budget housing, this new interest rate is genuinely democratic as buyers from any budget bandwidth will benefit."" Puri termed the SBI's decision as ""aptly timed"" ahead of the festive season.

""This year, we are likely to see significantly improved traction in the housing segment during this period. Waiving of processing fees and occupation-linked interest premium are added levels of savings,"" he said. Puri expected other lenders to follow SBI's footsteps in order to remain competitive.

Vikas Wadhawan, Group CFO, Housing.com, Makaan.com and Proptiger.com, said the reduction in home loan interest rates by SBI will help the sector gain further momentum. ""Prices are already subdued and buyers will be able to save a little more money,"" he added.

Amit Goyal, CEO, India Sotheby's International Realty, said the rate cut by some of the country's leading banks will act as a catalyst for faster decisions. ""SBI decision to offer lower interest rate irrespective of the prices of the unit or loan amount is likely to benefit buyers in the luxury segment as well. Given the upcoming festive season, which is considered auspicious by a large number of Indians to make big-ticket purchases, the timing of reduction in interest rate couldn't have been better,"" he added.

Raoul Kapoor, COO Andromeda, said the reduction in interest rates by major banks is expected to give a boost to the resurgent real estate market, especially during the busy festive season. Signature Global founder and chairman Pradeep Aggarwal said: ""The market is already on the up, and we expect that the recent decision by the SBI will help turn the table and lead to a substantial increase in sales.""

Nayan Raheja, Executive Director, Raheja Developers, said the demand for affordable and mid-segment houses will go up as affordability improves. ""This will be a double dose of benefit for buyers as developers have already kept the prices on a leash, even though construction cost is going up,"" Raheja added.

Noida-based ABA Corp Director Amit Modi hoped that other private and public sector banks would also announce similar initiatives to revive the market confidence. ""The market has already started seeing sales increase post-May 2021, and the home loan interest rate reduction will further boost the buying sentiment. We are looking forward to a faster recovery and hope the measure will expedite the sector to reach pre-COVID levels sooner than expected,"" he added.

Gurugram-based Silverglades group CEO Anubhav Jain said the SBI has set a trend for reducing home loan rates by reducing lending rate to as low as 6.7 per cent. This would go a long way in giving a boost to the real estate sector in the upcoming festive season, he added.

""Home buyers will be entitled to get home loans at 6.7 per cent irrespective of the amount of loan. Earlier, people seeking home loans over Rs 75 lakhs were required to pay comparatively higher rates. Also the decision to do away with distinction between salaried and non-salaried is welcome and makes the whole process simpler and transparent,"" Jain said. With the introduction of the new offer by the SBI, a borrower can now avail home loan for any amount at a rate as low as 6.70 per cent.

This will result in a saving of 45 basis points (bps) which translates to an interest saving of more than Rs 8 lakh, for a Rs 75 lakh loan with a 30-year tenure, SBI said. Further, the rate of interest applicable for a non-salaried home borrower was 15 bps higher than the interest rate applicable to a salaried borrower. The lender has removed this distinction between a salaried and a non-salaried borrower.

Now, there is no occupation-linked interest premium being charged to prospective home loan borrowers, the bank had said. Recently, Anarock issued its estimates of housing sales for the current calendar year, projecting 30 per cent increase in demand across seven major cities to nearly 1.8 lakh units in 2021.

However, it said that the demand would still be lower than the pre-Covid levels. In 2019, housing sales stood at 2,61,358 units across seven cities Delhi-NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata."

SBI invited EoI for the Rs 1,597.38 crore loan advanced to Coastal Energen after failing to find a resolution outside the National Company Law Tribunal, said one person.

The bank set a reserve price of Rs 796.25 crore, equivalent to about 50 paise for every rupee, according to the sale document on the bank’s website. An e-auction is scheduled for October 14.

Others who submitted expressions of interest by the September 9 deadline were ASREC (India), Omkara ARC, UV ARC, Prudent ARC, Alchemist ARC, Invest ARC, Maximum ARC and Paras ARC, the people said.

Aditya Birla ARC, Arcil, Phoenix ARC, JM Financial ARC and Deutsche Bank did not respond to requests for comment.

Earlier this month, Varde Partner-Aditya Birla ARC acquired Rs 1,720 crore of debt of distressed thermal power producer KSK Mahanadi Power from Punjab National Bank for Rs 752.28 crore, as reported by Moneycontrol.

India’s thermal power sector faces structural issues related to lack of progress in signing new long-term and medium-term power purchase agreements (PPA), subdued tariffs in the short-term market and payment delays by state distribution utilities, according to rating company ICRA.

Outlook not positive

Although electricity demand in India is estimated to grow 6 percent in FY22 on the back of a pick-up in economic activity and the relatively lower impact of the second wave of the pandemic, the outlook for thermal power generation has not yet turned positive, ICRA said.

“This is partly due to subdued thermal plant load factor, in some cases PPAs are not signed at all or are for short term, modest tariffs and continued delays in receiving payments,” said Sabyasachi Majumdar, group head and senior vice president at ICRA, a unit of Moody’s Investors Service.

On the positive side, the liquidity situation of some independent power producers has improved due to payments made under the liquidity support scheme by the Centre in March 2021, he said.

“Under the given circumstances, if investors are queuing up for such distressed assets, it is more likely to be driven by expectations of favourable valuations during acquisitions,” said Majumdar.

No buyer

Coastal Energen, an unlisted company promoted by the Ahmed Buhari family, operates two coal-based power units of 600 MW each in Tamil Nadu. It had Rs 7,794 crore of outstanding loans, according to a report by ICRA in May. The Buhari family and associates own 49 percent of the company. The remainder is held by lenders that invoked pledged shares in 2015 following a default in loan payments.

One power unit, which imports coal, has a 15-year supply agreement with a distribution company while the other is yet to find a buyer.

Delayed payments from Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation and the absence of a buyer for power from the second unit led to a stretched liquidity position, according to the ICR report.

Early this year, Buhari approached lenders with an offer to settle the company’s loan in partnership with Deutsche Bank and Ares SSG Capital, but the talks did not progress because the promoter did not make a binding offer, the first person said.

In 2019, a consortium of Deutsche Bank, Ares SSG Capital and the Buhari family offered Rs 3,000 crore to acquire the 51 percent stake held by the lenders and the entire debt of the company. The deal, which was conditional on all lenders agreeing, equated to 38 paise to a rupee, the person said. The promoter had even deposited Rs 150 crore, 50 percent of his contribution, with SBI, the person said.

However, the transaction did not close – initially due to a delay in getting approval from all the lenders.

Banks led by State Bank of India (SBI) have called on the Indian government to give debt-laden Vodafone Idea more time to clear its tax dues and spectrum fees, two bankers and a government official familiar with the matter said.

An Indian court last year ordered the mobile carrier, a joint venture between the Indian unit of Britain's Vodafone Group and Aditya Birla Group's Idea Cellular, to pay just over $8 billion to the government to settle long-standing dues. Vodafone has a stake of about 44 percent in the company and Aditya Birla owns nearly 27 percent.

In June, Vodafone Idea's then non-executive chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla warned that without a government reprieve the Indian mobile carrier's ""financial situation will drive its operations to an irretrievable point of collapse"".

Vodafone Idea's gross debt as of June 30 was 1.9 trillion rupees, comprising of deferred spectrum payment obligations of 1.06 trillion rupees and an adjusted gross revenue liability of 621.8 billion rupees, its latest stock exchange filing in June showed.

The adjusted gross revenue is the usage and licensing fee that telecom operators are charged by the Indian government.

The mobile operator also reported that it owes 234 billion Indian rupees ($3.18 billion) to financial institutions.

Senior SBI officials and representatives of the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) met finance and telecom department officials this month and proposed an immediate breather on the repayment of spectrum dues, the two bankers and the government official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters.

""We've had these discussions with the banks but the issue is the finance ministry needs to be comfortable with the measures,"" the government official said.

SBI, IBA, and the finance and telecom departments did not respond to Reuters requests seeking comment.

The company is facing a repayment of 5-10 billion rupees of non-convertible debentures around January, one of the bankers said.

Vodafone Idea declined to comment. Vodafone Group did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment. An Aditya Birla Group spokesman declined to comment.

Vodafone Idea had cash and cash equivalents of 9.2 billion rupees at the end of June, a transcript of a company conference call published on its website said.

""All eyes are on New Delhi right now as banks are getting increasingly nervous,"" another banker with exposure to Vodafone Idea said.

The bankers have also proposed providing some relief to Vodafone by restructuring its dues, one government official and two bankers said.

Birla stepped down as chairman early last month after appealing for the government bailout.

The government has been considering a broader package to help a telecom industry disrupted by the 2016 entry of Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Jio, which shook up the market with its free voice and cut-price data plans."

Know your AT1 Bonds

What are AT1 Bonds?

Additional Tier 1 Bonds, or AT1 Bonds, as these financial products are popularly known as, are a type of perpetual debt instruments that banks use to raise to increase their core capital base. These bonds are perpetual in nature—that simply means these do not carry a maturity date like trasitional bonds. While AT1 Bonds are a lucrative investment option for investors (as they offer higher returns compared with other comparable instruments), these carry high risk. If the capital ratios of an issuer falls below a certain percentage or in the event of an institutional failure, rules allow the issuer to stop paying interest or even write down these bonds. That's what happened with the Yes Bank episode."
"September 01, 2021 05:07 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-raises-rs-4000-crore-via-at1-bonds-7417311.html,"SBI | File image

State Bank of India has raised Rs 4,000 crore of the Basel- compliant Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds, it announced on September 1. The country’s largest lender raised the amount at a coupon rate of 7.72 percent.

Following the new SEBI regulations, this is the first AT1 Bond issuance in the domestic market. The issue garnered overwhelming response from investors with bids in excess of Rs 10,000 crore received against a base issue size of Rs 1,000 crore.

ALSO READ: SBI Balanced Advantage Fund records highest ever NFO collection at Rs 14,500 crore

The public sector bank has now decided to accept Rs 4,000 crore at a coupon of 7.72 percent based on the response.

According to SBI, this is the lowest pricing ever offered on such debt, issued by any Indian bank since the implementation of Basel III capital rules in 2013.

As per norms, the AT 1 instrument is perpetual in nature. However, it can be called back by the issuer after five years or any anniversary date thereafter.

While SBI has AAA credit rating from local credit agencies, the AT1 offering is rated AA+, which is the highest rating in the country for these instruments in view of the hybrid and high-risk nature of these instruments.

Earlier, the public sector bank raised the highest-ever NFO collection by any mutual fund scheme, through its SBI Balanced Advantage Fund (SBAF). The scheme has collected Rs 14,500 crore, which is more than what ICICI Prudential Flexicap Fund collected (Rs 9,500 crore) last month, which at the time, was the highest-ever NFO collection."

Kumar will also be a member of the Audit Committee and Risk Committee of HSBC Asia, which includes the Indian operation of the bank.

Notably, Kumar had retired as the SBI chief in October 2020, after working with the bank for nearly 40 years. He had joined SBI as a probationary officer in 1980, and is credited with the mega-merger of seven banks with India’s largest lender.

During Kumar's tenure as SBI chairman, the bank moved ahead with its digital drive through SBI’s YONO platform and consolidated its troubled corporate accounts. The bailout of stressed private lender Yes Bank was one of the biggest challenges during his term.

After retirement, Kumar had taken up an advisory role with Baring Private Equity Partners India in February 2021. In the same month, Kotak Investment Advisors (KIAL) announced that he would be the exclusive advisor for its $1 billion Special Situation Fund.

Kumar is not the first retiring SBI chairman to join private organisations. His predecessor at SBI, Arundhati Bhattacharya, is the India CEO of US Cloud-based service provider, Salesforce.com Inc.

Russia's Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy on Thursday said it has achieved financial closure for phase-one expansion plans for petrochemical business following the tie-up of Rs 4,016 crore funds from banks.

The company, which operates a 20 million tonnes a year refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat, is setting up a 450 kilo tonnes per annum polypropylene plant at the refinery to mark its foray into petrochemicals business.

""The company signed a financial agreement with a consortium of banks led by State Bank of India for a project term loan of Rs 4,016 crore,"" the company said in a statement.

For the proposed project, it is already in possession of required land.

In 2019, Nayara Energy had first announced its plans to expand into petrochemicals at the Vibrant Gujarat Summit.

""The loan facility carries a tenor of over 15 years and is amongst the largest private sector project finance deals in recent times,"" the statement said.

The project is proposed to be funded with a mix of debt and equity, it said without giving details.

Alois Virag, Chief Executive Officer, Nayara Energy said, ""The financial closure brings to fruition our growth plans to become one of the largest integrated energy and petrochemicals complexes in the country.""

The demand for polypropylene, he said, is expected to grow at around 10 per cent per annum.

""The construction of the first phase of the petrochemicals project is expected to be completed in 2023,"" he said. ""With this foray into petrochemicals, we are committed to make India a world-class petrochemicals hub.""

The buoyant response from financial institutions despite tepid market conditions is a vindication of the trust and confidence in the company, its strong parentage and leadership, Anup Vikal, Chief Financial Officer, Nayara Energy added.

""The project will provide a boost to the profitability of the company and improve Nayara Energy's overall financial performance over the next few years in line with the asset development strategy adopted by the shareholders,"" he said.

In August 2017, Rosneft and an investment consortium comprising global commodity trading firm Trafigura and UCP Investment Group had acquired Essar Oil and renamed it Nayara Energy.

The company owns and operates India's second largest single site refinery. It also operates a fuel retail network consisting of over 6,000 petrol pumps across India and is the fastest growing private retailer in the energy sector."

The scheme has collected Rs 14,500 crore. This is more than what ICICI Prudential Flexicap Fund collected (Rs 9,500 crore) last month, which at the time, was the highest-ever NFO collection.

Sources say that the State Bank of India collected nearly Rs 6,000 crore out of the total inflows. The fund house refused to comment as the counting is still on. But, prima facie, two factors appear to have worked for the newly launched scheme. SBI is India’s largest bank with over 24,000 branches in India. A senior mutual fund industry official who did not wish to be quoted says that nearly 14,000 of the bank’s branches got inflows.

Secondly, the fund’s mandate is suitable for present time when equity markets are at their all-time highs. A balanced advantage fund, such as SBAF, automatically shifts from equities to debt instruments when equity markets go up substantially. Instead of investors having to do this manually in other schemes, balanced advantage funds do it automatically."

The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) has moved an application to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) seeking licence to set up a Rs 6,000-crore National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (NARCL) or bad bank, according to sources. NARCL was incorporated last month in Mumbai following the registration with Registrar of Companies (RoC).

According to sources, the company after mobilising an initial capital of Rs 100 crore and fulfilling other legal formalities has approached the RBI seeking licence to undertake asset reconstruction business. The RBI in 2017, raised the capital requirement to Rs 100 crore from the earlier level of Rs 2 crore, keeping in mind the higher amount of cash required to buy bad loans.

RBI has its process and procedure for granting licence for such business, sources said, adding, it could take next few weeks to obtain licence from the regulator. RBI's approval could come either in September or October, sources added.

Legal consultant AZB & Partners has been engaged to seek various regulatory approvals and fulfilling other legal formalities. IBA, entrusted with the task of setting up a bad bank, has put a preliminary board for NARCL in place. The company has hired P M Nair, a stressed assets expert from State Bank of India (SBI), as the managing director.

The other directors on the board are IBA Chief Executive Sunil Mehta, SBI Deputy Managing Director S S Nair and Canara Bank's Chief General Manager Ajit Krishnan Nair. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Budget 2021-22, announced that the high level of provisioning by public sector banks of their stressed assets calls for measures to clean up bank books.

""An Asset Reconstruction Company Limited and Asset Management Company would be set up to consolidate and take over the existing stressed debt,"" she had said in the Budget Speech. It will manage and dispose the assets to alternative investment funds and other potential investors for eventual value realisation, she had said. Last year, IBA made a proposal for the creation of a bad bank for swift resolution of non-performing assets. The government accepted the proposal and decided to go for an asset reconstruction company and asset management company model in this regard.

Meanwhile, state-owned Canara Bank has expressed its intent to be the lead sponsor of NARCL with a 12 per cent stake. The proposed NARCL would be 51 per cent owned by PSBs and the remaining by private-sector lenders.

NARCL will take over identified bad loans of lenders. The lead bank with an offer in the hand of NARCL will go for a 'Swiss Challenge', wherein other asset reconstruction players will be invited to better the offer made by a chosen bidder for finding a higher valuation of a non-performing asset on sale. The company will pick up those assets that are 100 per cent provided for by the lenders. Banks have identified around 22 bad loans worth Rs 89,000 crore to be transferred to NARCL in the initial phase."

As we all know that password hacking has become insanely popular and digital technology has both upsides and downsides.

This suggestion by the SBI is to protect its customers from hackers who are looking for the latest way to get access to sensitive data, including your email, bank account.

Creating strong unbreakable passwords, changing your password regularly will help you to fight against these hackers and it will also protect your data and keep you away from online fraud.

SBI in a tweet said, ""A strong password ensures higher levels of security. Here are 8 ways in which you can create an unbreakable password and protect yourself from cybercrime"".

-Use a combination of both uppercase and lowercase letters. e.g. aBjsE7uG

-Use both numbers and symbols, e.g. AbjsE7uG61!@

-Use a minimum of 8 characters to ensure adequate security. e.g. aBjsE7uG

-Do not use any common dictionary words. e.g. itislocked or thisismypassword

-Do not use memorable keyboard paths like ""qwerty"" or ""asdfg"". Instead, play with your keyboard and add emoticons like "":)"", "":/""

-Do not keep obvious passwords like 12345678 or abcdefg.

- Do not use easy-to-guess substitutions like DOORBELL - DOOR8377.

-Keep your password long and do not connect it with your family/birth date etc. e.g. Ramesh@1967.

In a challenging market environment, the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) has delivered a strong set of numbers in the April-June quarter. The asset quality numbers remain at elevated levels yet the trend is in line with the industry.

“No negative should be taken as positive in this environment,” said Sidhharth Purohit, research analyst at Mumbai-based SMC Global Securities. “Incremental stress built up is not very high. Slippages are also on the expected line. Provision Coverage Ratio is down quarter-on-quarter but still close to 70 percent. So very low risk from any likely third wave (sic),” said Purohit.

What has happened on the bad loan segment? Let's take a look at the numbers.

SBI’s gross non-performing assets (GNPA) numbers came at 5.32 percent compared with 4.98 percent in the preceding quarter. But, if one looks at the incremental slippages, during the quarter the bank reported fresh slippages of Rs 15,666 crore compared with Rs 21,934 crore in the preceding quarter. The bank approved loans worth Rs 5,246 crore for the second round of restructuring and has pending applications for Rs 2,056 crore.

Clearly, the State Bank has not escaped the second wave impact. It is seeing pressure on the asset quality. Still, the numbers are in line with some of its closer rivals. For instance, the numbers of Axis Bank, released on July 26, were the latest to confirm the larger trend. The bank’s GNPAs and net NPAs in the April-June quarter rose to 3.85 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively, against the GNPA and NNPA ratio of 3.7 percent and 1.05 percent in the previous quarter.

The same is the case with Kotak Mahindra Bank. The gross NPAs stood at 3.56 percent against 3.25 percent on a sequential basis whereas the net NPA came at 1.28 percent from 1.21 percent. These numbers are in line with the trend shown by other banks—HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and big NBFCs such as Bajaj Finance (auto loan NPAs of 19.15 percent against 9.31 percent in the March quarter of FY 2021 and just 5.8 percent in the year-ago period), L&T Finance and M&M Finance (where GNPAs rose to 15.5 percent against 9 percent last year).

Of the Rs 15,666 crore fresh NPA additions in Q1, Rs 6,416 crore is from small and medium enterprises book. Loan growth is muted across segments. Domestic credit growth was at 5.64 percent YoY, mainly driven by retail (personal) advances (16.47 percent YoY), agri advances (2.48 percent YoY) and SME (2.01 percent YoY), the bank said.

The profit was higher than Street’s expectations. A CNBC-TV18 poll of analysts had estimated Q1 profit at Rs 6,374.5 crore.

SBI's operating profit increased by 5.06 percent to Rs 18,975 crore in the quarter from Rs 18,061 crore in the year-ago period. The operating profit, excluding exceptional items, increased 14.85 percent.

Net interest income (NII), the difference between the interest income from lending activities and the interest paid to depositors, grew 3.74 percent YoY. The net interest margin (NIM) for the quarter stood at 3.15 percent. The domestic net interest margin (NIM) for Q1FY22 came at 3.15 percent, which was lower by 9 bps YoY.

The numbers are largely in line with analyst expectations. ""Risk reward is favourable for the stock now,"" said Purohit of SMC Global. However, just like for other banks, SBI’s performance going ahead will depend on the COVID environment and the pace of vaccinations. The next few quarters should offer a clearer pattern."

State Bank of India (SBI) on August 4 reported a 55.25 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in the June quarter net profit at Rs 6,504 crore, up from Rs 4,189.34 crore in the same quarter of the previous year.

The profit was higher than Street’s expectations. A CNBC-TV18 poll of analysts had estimated Q1 profit at Rs 6,374.5 crore.

The country’s large public sector bank’s operating profit increased by 5.06 percent to Rs 18,975 crore in the quarter from Rs 18,061 crore in the year-ago period. The operating profit, excluding exceptional items, increased 14.85 percent.

Domestic net interest margin (NIM) for Q1FY22 came at 3.15 percent, which was lower by 9 bps YoY.

Total deposits grew at 8.82 percent YoY. Current account deposits grew by 11.75 percent and saving by 10.55 percent YoY.

Domestic credit growth was at 5.64 percent YoY, mainly driven by retail (personal) advances (16.47 percent YoY), agri advances (2.48 percent YoY) and SME (2.01 percent YoY), the bank said in a BSE filing.

Net non-performing assets ratio declined 9 bps YoY to 1.77 percent. Gross NPA ratio fell 12 bps YoY to 5.32 percent.

Provisions for NPA were at Rs 5,029.8 crore against Rs 9,914.2 crore QoQ and Rs 9,420 crore YoY. Provisions refer to the amount a bank needs to set aside to cover the losses from a loan account. When an account turns into an NPA, the provisions required will equal the full loan amount.​

The slippage ratio for Q1FY22 stood at 2.47 percent from 0.60 percent at the end of Q1FY21. Credit cost at the end of Q1FY22 declined 77 bps YoY to 0.79 percent.

Capital adequacy ratio improved by 26 bps YoY to 13.66 percent as of June 2021, without including Q1FY22 profit, the bank said.

The better than expected numbers lifted the stock, which jumped almost 5 percent to hit its 52-week high of Rs 466.90 on BSE."

SBI had waived off the processing fee completely in September last year too. There is an aggressive competition among leading banks to chase retail customers. Banks perceive individual loans as a safer bet compared with big ticker corporate loans.

Announcing the waiver in processing fee, C.S. Setty, managing director of SBI said the offer of processing fee waiver will ""facilitate and encourage home buyers to take decision with ease, as interest rate is at its historic low.""

SBI's home loan portfolio has crossed the milestone of Rs 5 lakh crore.

Several banks are moving to divest their stake from Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) to free up capital in preparation to launch the National Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd (NARCL) commonly known as ‘Bad bank’ that they will commonly own.

Three public sector banks—Union Bank of India, Indian Bank, and Bank of India—said they jointly intend to sell up to 88.4 million shares, constituting up to 90.31 percent of the total equity share capital of ASREC India Limited, a Mumbai based ARC, Mint reported adding that SBI Capital Markets Ltd (SBI Caps) has been appointed to advise on the transaction. Reportedly, the potential bidder “should have a net worth of not less than ₹100 crore or should have assets under management of not less than ₹500 crores.”

Punjab National Bank had put out its stake of 10.01 percent in Arcil, one of the oldest ARCs of India, for sale. Similarly, IDBI Bank is also vying to sell its 19.8 percent stake in Arcil, the report added.

Having secured a licence from the Registrar of Companies, the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) will soon move an application to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to set up a Rs 6,000-crore National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (NARCL) or bad bank, according to PTI sources.

The RBI in 2017 raised capital requirement to Rs 100 crore from the earlier level of Rs 2 crore keeping in mind the higher amount of cash required to buy bad loans.

The initial capital would come from eight banks who have committed, and the NARCL would expand the capital base to Rs 6,000 crore subsequently after the RBI's nod, the sources said.

IBA, entrusted with the task of setting up a bad bank, has put a preliminary board for NARCL in place. The company has hired PM Nair, a stressed assets expert from State Bank of India (SBI), as the managing director. The other directors on the board are IBA Chief Executive Sunil Mehta, SBI Deputy Managing Director SS Nair and Canara Bank's Chief General Manager Ajit Krishnan Nair.

The proposed NARCL would be 51 per cent owned by PSBs and the remaining by private-sector lenders.

State Bank of India (SBI) has urged the users to go to Income Tax e-filing portal and link PAN and Aadhaar to enjoy “seamless banking services"". If an individual misses the deadline, he or she will be liable to pay a penalty not exceeding more than Rs 1,000.

If Aadhaar card and Permanent Account Number (PAN) card are not linked, you may face problems in banking services and financial transactions. Linking of Aadhaar card and PAN card was extended by the Income Tax Department Till September 30.

If PAN card and Aadhaar card are not linked before the deadline, PAN will become useless and declared “inoperative"". According to Clause 41 of Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act, ""The permanent account number allotted to a person shall be made inoperative after the notified date in the manner as may be provided by rules if a person fails to intimate the Aadhaar number.

The PAN Card is a 10-digit unique alphanumeric number issued by the Income Tax department. As PAN is linked to all financial transactions made by individuals, it helps the tax officials to prevent tax evasion and frauds.

The banks have started asking customers to link their PAN and Aadhaar details soon to avoid any inconvenience.

SBI mentioned on its official Twitter handle, ""We advise our customers to link their PAN with Aadhaar to avoid any inconvenience and continue enjoying a seamless banking service.""

SBI mentioned on Twitter, “If not linked, PAN will be rendered inoperative or inactive and cannot be quoted for conducting specified transactions.""

While depositing Rs 50,000 or more in a day, then PAN is mandatory. While buying mutual funds, debentures, bonds, etc worth more than Rs 50,000, PAN card may be mandatory.

If a PAN card becomes inactive, banking services will be affected."

The team found that the WhatsApp message also redirects the user to another link.

Hackers, reportedly of Chinese origin, are brewing fresh trouble for the State Bank of India (SBI) by targeting users' bank accounts with phishing scams. Cybersecurity researchers have warned that hackers are asking customers to update their KYC using a particular website link and luring them with free gifts worth Rs 50 lakh via a WhatsApp message.

The research wing of New Delhi-based think tank CyberPeace Foundation, along with Autobot Infosec Pvt Ltd, studied two such incidents faced by some smartphone users, IANS reported.

Read: Hackers hit SBI users with text phishing scam, request them to redeem credit points worth Rs 9,870

In the first case of the text message requesting KYC verification, the landing page resembled the official SBI online page.

""It then asks for the OTP sent to the user's mobile number. As soon as the OTP is entered, it redirects the user to another page that asks the users to enter some confidential information again like account holder name, mobile number, date of birth. After entering the data, it redirects the user to an OTP page,"" the researchers said, as quoted by IANS.

On clicking the ""Continue to Login"" button, it redirects the user to the full-kyc.php page, asking for confidential information like username, password and a captcha in order to log in to the online banking.

""All the domain names associated with the campaign have the registrant country as China,"" the research team said.

The research team concluded that the campaign pretended to be launched from the State Bank of India, is hosted on the third-party domain instead of the official website www.onlinesbi.com.

The overall layout of the web page used in the campaign is kept similar to the official SBI net banking site to convince the users.

In the second instance of fraud, users were promised attractive free gifts. The team found that the WhatsApp message also redirects the user to another link.

""On the landing page, a congratulations message appears with a photo of State Bank of India and asks users to participate in a quick survey to get a free gift of Rs 50 lakh from the State bank of India,"" the researchers informed.

At the bottom of the page, a section appears which seems to be a Facebook comment section where many users have commented about how the offer is beneficial.

""The URL manipulation showed that the webserver has directory listing enabled and found other links visible which proves that not only the SBI users, IDFC, PNB, IndusInd and Kotak bank users are also targeted by the same type of phishing scam,"" the team noted.

In March this year, the same research team had pointed out that several users of the SBI were targeted in a phishing scam where hackers flooded them with suspicious text messages, requesting them to redeem their SBI credit points worth Rs 9,870.

Startups and tech companies are continuously launching new software to run the real world. This column will attempt to be the ""Hello World"" for the real world.

Between 1998 and 2000, Amazon raised $2.2 billion in three junk bond offerings, Brad Stone, the author of The Everything Store points out. The capital came cheap as lenders at the peak of the dot-com boom were happy to take risky bets. Jeff Bezos used this money to fund the company’s hyper growth—acquiring companies and building distribution centres across America.

Just ahead of the dot-com crash, Amazon again sold convertible bonds worth $672 million to European investors to shore up its balance sheet. The money from corporate bonds helped Amazon tide over the crash. “Without that cushion, Amazon would almost certainly have faced the prospect of insolvency over the next year,” Stone writes in the book.

While Bezos was vocal about the fact that he’s not defined by his stock price, the crash ushered in an era of “discipline, efficiency and eliminating waste” at Amazon.

It was a private equity investor who last month pointed out to me that these events, leading up to the crash and after, are instructive these days as several Indian tech companies gear up to go public. “India’s junk bond markets are not mature like in the US, and if these companies need more money to fuel their growth, they might have to raise more money,” the private equity founder said.

The argument goes something like this: The markets are doing well these days because of fiscal stimulus and lower interest rates in the wake of Covid-19. So it is a good opportunity for these companies to list. But which companies will do well?

The companies that have sound business fundamentals and have a path to profitability will probably sail through. But for companies that may need to raise more capital along the way after going public, like Amazon in the late noughties, this may mean raising capital from corporate bonds. This is where it gets tricky in India.

India’s corporate bonds market is expected to double to ₹65-70 lakh crore by fiscal 2025, but more than 80% of this goes to government bonds. The rest of the money chases top rated bonds. That is, junk bonds also known as high yield bonds, hardly get any traction.

By that logic, India’s bond markets may not be very receptive to loss making companies. Raising money in times of distress is almost never a good idea. Take the case of Kesoram Industries Limited, the 100-year old cement manufacturer from Kolkata. Bloomberg reported in March that the debt-laden company raised $221 million from bonds rated D at a yield that can go as high as 21%. That's very expensive capital.

The silver lining is that Indian firms can tap into the offshore bond market which seems to be showing an appetite for Indian companies (although mostly in infrastructure). In the first two months of 2021, Indian companies such as Adani Ports, Power Finance Corporation and SBI have raised over $3.3 billion from overseas bonds, according to Refinitiv, a market data service.

I’m not an expert on corporate bonds and it may yet rise up to meet the demand in the future, but common sense dictates that like Amazon, Indian tech companies might soon enter an era of “discipline, efficiency and eliminating waste”, once they go public."

ICRA said it had been trying to seek information from the company to monitor its performance, but despite repeated requests, the management of the company remained non-cooperative. It had also advised lenders and investors of the company to exercise appropriate caution while using the rating action as it might not adequately reflect the credit risk profile of the company.

How do the new fixed deposit rules affect you?

There is a small change in the way your fixed deposit (FD) interest will be calculated. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) says after an FD matures, if the amount is not claimed by the depositor, interest will be equal to the savings account, or the interest rate on FD, whichever is lower. Earlier, it would have attracted just the savings bank rate. Say, you have a 1-year FD with SBI, at an interest of 5% p.a and the interest on the bank's savings account is 2.7% annually. Assume that neither did you withdraw your money or renew the FD on its maturity. The bank will now calculate the interest rate after maturity, per the savings account rate. It's best to withdraw or renew your FD on maturity."

Cash withdrawals by account holders of BSBD accounts will now be charged Rs 15 plus goods and services tax after the first four free transactions in a month. The charge will remain the same irrespective of which bank’s ATM the customer uses.

The revision in SBI’s ATM charges follows a notification by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) earlier this month to raise the interchange fee on each financial transaction at an ATM to Rs 17 from Rs 15. Beyond the free transactions for customers, the ceiling on customer charges was raised to Rs 21 per transaction from Rs 20 earlier to account for the higher outgo on interchange for banks. The new interchange shall be effective from January 1, 2022.

Moneycontrol breaks down for you the concept of interchange and the rationale for charging customers for cash withdrawals.

What is interchange fee?

Each time Bank A's customer uses their card to make a transaction at an ATM deployed by Bank B, Bank A must pay a fee to Bank B, which is called the interchange fee. As per RBI guidelines, banks in India absorb this cost for the first five transactions -- financial and non-financial -- every month from the customer’s own bank ATMs. They also bear the cost for the first three transactions from other bank ATMs in metro centres and the first five transactions in non-metro centres.

How much can a bank charge a customer to compensate for interchange?

Once a customer has crossed the free transaction limit for a month, their bank is entitled to charge them to make up for its interchange outgo. In its circular issued on June 10, the RBI raised the cap on such customer charges to Rs 21 from Rs 20 per transaction. Of course, banks can choose to charge less than the prescribed cap.

Why was the interchange fee hiked?

For years, private banks and white label ATM operators had been seeking a hike in the interchange fee to Rs 18 from Rs 15, citing a rise in the cost of operations. Finally, in June 2019, the RBI set up a committee led by then chief executive of the Indian Banks’ Association VG Kannan to review the entire gamut of ATM charges and fees, with a particular focus on interchange structure for ATM transactions.

The RBI accepted the committee’s recommendations and accepted the industry’s contention that there had been an increase in the cost of ATM deployment and expenses towards ATM maintenance incurred by banks and white label ATM operators since the last change in interchange fee structure in August 2012. To account for the cost escalation, the RBI raised the interchange fee to Rs 17 from Rs 15 for financial transactions and to six rupees from five rupees for non-financial transactions in all centres.

What caused a spike in the maintenance cost of ATMs?

In the nine years since 2012, inflation has played a role in increasing the cost of maintaining and operating ATMs. In addition, the RBI’s April 2018 guidelines on cash management and logistics, which mandated GPS-enabled cash vans and armed guards to man them, among other things, led to a further escalation in operational costs for white-label ATM operators.

Who wanted an increase in interchange charges and why?

It was predominantly private banks and white-label ATM operators who sought a hike in the interchange. Most private banks have a larger network of ATMs in urban locations than public sector banks. However, the size of the former’s depositor base is smaller than that of the latter. As a result, the likelihood of a public sector bank customer making a transaction at a private bank’s ATM is quite high. So while private banks stood to gain from a higher interchange fee, public sector banks would end up paying more in the event of a hike. White-label ATM operators wanted a hike in the interchange because many of them deploy ATMs on behalf of public sector banks in tier-III to tier-VI locations and the existing fee was insufficient to make up for the cost of operating in the interiors of the country."

The country's largest lender SBI will levy charges for cash withdrawal beyond four free transactions in a month from customers holding the basic savings bank deposit (BSBD) accounts.

These customers will also be levied charges for cheque book beyond 10 leaves in a year.

As per the revision in service charges for BSBD accounts, State Bank of India (SBI) will levy charges ranging from Rs 15 to Rs 75 for the ""additional value added services"" with effect from July 1, 2021.

Non-financial transactions and transfer transactions will be free of cost at branches, ATM, CDM (cash dispensing machines) for the BSBD account holders.

SBI said it will charge Rs 15 plus GST per cash withdrawal for transaction at bank branches, SBI ATM or from other bank's ATMs beyond 4 free cash withdrawals.

""Charges will be recovered beyond 4 free cash withdrawal transaction (including ATM and branch),"" SBI said.

With respect to cheque book services, first 10 cheque leaves will be free of cost in a financial year.

Thereafter, 10 leaf cheque book will be levied Rs 40 plus GST; 25 leaf cheque book at Rs 75 plus GST and emergency cheque book will attract a charge of Rs 50 plus GST for 10 leaves or part thereof, SBI said.

""However, senior citizen customers are exempted (on cheque book services),"" said the state-owned lender.

BSBD accounts can be opened by any individual after valid KYC (know your customer) documentation.

Such accounts are primarily meant for poorer sections of society to encourage them to start saving without any burden of charges or fees.

According to a study revealed by IIT-Bombay in April this year, SBI earned over Rs 300 crore by way of imposing service charges on nearly 12 crore BSBD account holders during 2015-20.

The study observed that SBI levying a charge of Rs 17.70 for every debit transaction beyond four on the BSBD account holders was not ""reasonable.""

As per the study, apart from SBI, the second largest public sector lender Punjab National Bank collected Rs 9.9 crore from from 3.9 crore BSBD accounts during the same period.

Levying of charges on BSBDA is guided by September 2013 RBI guidelines. As per the direction these accounts holders are ""allowed more than four withdrawals"" in a month, at the bank's discretion provided the bank does not charge for the same.

The country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has adjusted to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and is well poised to deal with any further pandemic-induced disruptions, its Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said.

He said the bank is comfortably placed in terms of growth capital and it will explore opportunities for lending in promising sectors to diversify the portfolio and to contain the risks.

""The bank has adjusted to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and is better positioned to tackle any subsequent wave,"" Khara said while addressing the bank's shareholders at the 66th annual general meeting held virtually.

""I am cautiously optimistic that the performance trajectory for the FY2021 will continue in FY2022 as well,"" he said.

During the financial year ended March 31, 2021, the bank reported the highest-ever standalone net profit of Rs 20,410 crore against a net profit of Rs 14,488 crore in the previous year.

The gross NPAs ratio declined to 4.98 per cent in FY21 from 6.15 per cent in the last year. The PCR (provisioning coverage ratio) also improved to 87.75 per cent.

Khara said the business continuity plans that were chalked out have worked well for the bank, and it was reflected in various parameters of the consolidated financial statements as of March 2021.

He said the current financial year 2021-22 has begun with an unexpected second wave of COVID-19 infections.

Although the containment strategy this time included avoiding complete lockdown and managing the situation through micro-containment zones, the impact on the economy will nevertheless, be felt, he said.

In the current financial year, Khara said the bank will continue to accelerate its digital agenda. The scope and the reach of YONO will be expanded further.

""With the roll-out of pre-packaged insolvency for resolution, resumption of courts and formation of the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL), efforts will be in full force to keep the momentum in stressed asset recovery in the current financial year,"" Khara informed the shareholders.

He said the bank is committed to creating an environment of increased risk awareness at all levels. It also aims at constantly upgrading controls and security measures, including cybersecurity measures, to ensure the mitigation of various risks.

Khara said the lender has been tracking the credit portfolio very closely during the current pandemic. The internal control mechanism of the bank has also been strengthened, wherever required.

With the current capital adequacy ratio at around 13.74 per cent, the bank is fairly comfortable on the capital front.

""We are expecting about nine per cent credit growth and we are well equipped to take care of this kind of credit growth,"" Khara later said while answering shareholders'' questions.

He said that currently, the bank has 406 loss-making branches and it has made an appropriate action plan to revive them.

The lender has got a definite timeline to turn around the loss-making branches in the near future. It has strategies that include focussing on high yielding advances, improving fee-based income, a sharper focus on the government business and customer value enhancement products, he said.

""We are strictly monitoring the implementation of these action plans,"" he told shareholders.

In extreme cases, if at all, a loss-making branch cannot be turned profitable, the bank is providing CSP (customer service point) and correspondent channel to serve the customers and reduce the number of such branches, he said.

During the year, the bank wrote off Rs 34,000 crore of loans, he said.

Khara added that despite the second wave of COVID-19, the country's economy is poised for a recovery in FY2022."

A State Bank of India (SBI)-led consortium that lent loans to fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya on Friday received Rs 5,824.5 crore in its accounts after shares of UBL, earlier attached under the anti-money laundering law, were sold recently, the ED said.

Mallya is accused in a multiple banks loan default case of about Rs 9,000 crore.

The disputes resolution tribunal (DRT) had sold these shares on June 23 after the Enforcement Directorate had transferred shares worth about Rs 6,624 crore of UBL to the SBI-led consortium on the directions of a special PMLA court that is hearing the case involving Mallya in Mumbai.

These shares were attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) by the ED, a central probe agency.

""Today, SBI led consortium received Rs 5824.5 crore in its account from the sale of shares of United Breweries Limited.""

""The sale had taken place on 23.06.2021 as sequel to the transfer of the shares to the Recovery Officer by ED,"" the central agency tweeted.

The rest of the shares worth about Rs 800 are ""expected"" to be sold and realised in the accounts of the SBI-led group of banks by June 25, it had earlier said.

The ED had issued a statement on Wednesday stating that about 40 per cent of the money lost by banks in alleged frauds perpetrated by fugitive businessmen Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Mallya has been recovered so far due to its ""swift"" action in attaching and freezing their assets.

Mallya, who fled to the UK, is being probed by the ED and the CBI for a Rs 9,000 crore alleged bank fraud linked to the operations of his now defunct Kingfisher Airlines.

On Wednesday, the ED had said the banks had ""recovered"" Rs 1,357 crore by a similar sale of shares in the case against Mallya.

The liquor baron has lost his case against extradition to India and as he has been denied permission to file appeal in the UK Supreme Court, his extradition to India has become final, the ED had said.

Commenting on the development, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had tweeted on Wednesday that ""Fugitives & economic offenders will be actively pursued; their properties attached & dues recovered."""

Country's largest lender by assets, State Bank of India (SBI), has divested its stake in non-core assets and invested nearly Rs 600 crore in private equity and alternative investment funds, it's chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said in the speech at the bank's 66th annual general meeting on June 25.

Divesting stake in non-core assets is part of the bank's strategy.

Also, SBI's investment portfolio increased to Rs 13.62 lakh crore in financial year 2021 compared to Rs 10.58 lakh crore in financial year 2020, mainly due to rise in SLR investments, the bank said.

Also, SBI issued bonds to the tune of $600 million in January 2021, with fixed coupon of sub 2 percent- one of the lowest borrowing rates by an Indian corporate, Khara said.

In FY21, while the banking industry’s advances grew at a 59-year low of 5.6 percent, SBI’s domestic advances grew by 5.67 percent to Rs 21.83 lakh crore, compared to 3.75 percent growth in FY2020.

The whole bank advances of SBI grew to the level of Rs 25.39 lakh crore in FY2021 from the previous year’s level of Rs 24.23 lakh crore, Khara said.

While growth in retail lending helped us cross the milestone of Rs five lakh crore in home loans with a market share of 34.53 percent, credit to corporate segment remained subdued and contracted by 3.02 percent to Rs 8.19 lakh crore in FY2021, which is in line with the industry trend, Khara said.

Agri and small and medium enterprises (SME ) loans increased by 3.92 percent to Rs 2.14 lakh crore and 4.24 percent to Rs 2.79 lakh crore, respectively. With decline in Corporate Loan book, the share of personal segment in the domestic loan book has increased to 39.89 percent from 36.19 percent last year, Khara said.

Khara said despite the outbreak of the pandemic and consequent lockdown in FY2021, SBI was able to achieve a reduction in the level of gross NPAs by Rs 22,703 crore by March 2021. The corporate segment saw the largest reduction in NPAs at Rs 18,530 crore.

The gross NPA ratio of the bank declined to 4.98 percent from 6.15 percent in the last year. The PCR has also improved to 87.75 percent in FY21 from 83.62 percent in FY20, Khara said.

The country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on June 24 said it has launched a new business loan product targeted at the healthcare sector. Under the new product, hospitals, nursing homes, diagnostic centres, pathology labs, and other manufacturing and supply-related businesses engaged in critical healthcare can avail of loans up to Rs 100 crore repayable in 10 years.

Called ‘Aarogyam’ loans, these facilities can be availed either as term loan to support expansion or modernisation or as working capital facilities such as cash credit, bank guarantees or letters of credit. In metro centres, loans under Aarogyam can be availed up to Rs 100 crore, in Tier I and urban centres up to Rs 20 crore and in Tier II to Tier VI centres up to Rs 10 crore.

The borrowers taking loans of up to Rs two crore will not be required to offer any collateral or security to SBI. Such loans will be covered under the guarantee scheme of Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises.

The bank said that the product is being launched in acknowledgment of the healthcare sector’s contribution amid the COVID-19 outbreak. “We believe this special loan product will provide the much-needed financial support to enable expansion/modernisation of existing facilities and also creation of new facilities.

""With Aarogyam Healthcare Business Loan, our endeavour is towards strengthening the healthcare infrastructure across the entire country,” said Dinesh Khara, Chairman, SBI.

Aarogyam healthcare business loans will be eligible under the COVID loan book being created by banks as part of the relief measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

On May 5, the central bank had opened an on-tap liquidity window of Rs 50,000 crore with tenors of up to three years at the repo rate for ramping up COVID-related healthcare infrastructure and services in the country.

On May 30, public sector banks had announced that they have come up with three sets of products to build a COVID book under the RBI’s scheme of liquidity and the expanded emergency credit line guarantee scheme (ECLGS 4.0) for healthcare institutions, including a healthcare business loan for setting up oxygen plants, business loans for healthcare facilities and unsecured personal loans for COVID treatment.

Further, retail investors have shown higher interest in markets and their numbers have increased by 1.42 crore in FY21 and another 44 lakh in April and May, they said in a note, wondering if this will be a lasting behavioural change or is transitory.

The economists at the country's largest lender attributed the growth in equity markets to lower returns on other financial instruments amid a low rates regime, increase in global liquidity, and even a tendency to spend more time at home because of mobility restrictions which led many to trade more.

It can be noted that in the past, the Reserve Bank has also expressed risks of financial stability because of the fast growth in stock markets.

From a returns perspective, it said sector-wise one-year return indicates that IT and materials have performed better.

The increasing retail participation, if it becomes the norm, could also enable a larger resource pool for financing India's infrastructural requirements, the economists said.

They further pointed out that the share of savings in shares and debentures to total household financial savings at 3.4 per cent in FY20 is likely to increase in FY21 to 4.8-5.0 per cent or 0.7 per cent of GDP from 0.4 per cent of GDP in FY20."

The bonds are proposed to be raised in Indian or US currency.

""The central board of the bank at its meeting held today on June 21, 2021, accorded approval for raising capital by way of issuance of Basel III compliant debt instruments in USD and/or INR during FY22,"" SBI said in a regulatory filing.

Under this, the bank plans to raise fresh additional tier I capital up to an amount of Rs 14,000 crore subject to the government of India concurrence, it added.

Tier 1 capital refers to a bank's core capital. It includes disclosed reserves that are present on a bank's financial statements and equity capital. A lender uses tier I capital to function on a regular basis and it forms the basis of a financial institution's strength.

To comply with Basel-III capital regulations, banks globally need to improve and strengthen their capital planning processes.

These norms are being implemented to mitigate concerns on potential stresses on asset quality and consequential impact on performance and profitability of banks.

A clutch of banks led by the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), is preparing to sell fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya’s shareholdings in three companies on June 23 in a bid to recover as much as Rs 6,200 crore lent to his grounded Kingfisher Airlines.

The share sale is due to happen through bulk deals in the three firms, United Breweries Limited, United Spirits Limited and McDowell Holding Limited, according to documents reviewed by Moneycontrol.

Mallya’s airline Kingfisher was grounded on October 20, 2012, after it plunged into a financial crisis. Mallya was declared a fugitive economic offender in January 2019 for defaulting on loans and allegedly defrauding banks. He is fighting extradition to India in UK courts.

If the share sale happens, this will be the first instance of banks making a significant recovery in the Kingfisher-Vijay Mallya case since the loan turned NPA, or bad asset, in late 2012. Mallya left India on March 2, 2016, for the UK after defrauding 17 banks and has not returned since then. He owes Rs 9,000 crore to banks and the accrued interest amount.

According to the documents reviewed by Moneycontrol, the sale of shares will happen under the scrutiny of the Bengaluru Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), which has authorised the recovery officer for the sale of shares to recover “Rs 6,203 crore along with costs and interest at 11.5 per cent calculating from June 25, 2013, till the date of recovery”.

What happens if the share sale fails?

In the event of a failure of shares under a block deal, banks can sell shares through the bulk, or retail, mode starting from June 24, the DRT documents showed. There is no “legal impediment for the Recovery Officer-||, Debt Recovery Tribunal-2 to sell the properties which are restored by the honourable special court,” the DRT order said.

Besides SBI, lenders to Kingfisher Airlines include Punjab National Bank, IDBI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Allahabad Bank, Federal Bank, and Axis Bank, among others. These lenders gave loans to Mallya over a period of few years against intangibles like company brand and goodwill and Mallya’s personal guarantee.

As per the share sale plan, the recovery officer will sell around 22 lakhs shares of McDowell Holding Limited, 4.13 crore shares of UBL and 25.02 lakh shares of USL in a block deal on 23 June. At today’s market price, McDowell Holdings will fetch Rs 13.8 crore, UBL stake will fetch Rs 5,565 crore while United Spirits shares will be sold at Rs 165 crore.

Banks are not in favour of selling shares in the open markets as such an action could negatively impact the share price of these companies, said one of the persons familiar with the matter, asking not to be named.

After the block deal dutch drinks company Heineken, which has around 46 percent shares of United Breweries, may increase its stake by at least 5 percent, taking its total shareholding to 51 per cent in the firm. Another existing investor, too, has shown interest in increasing shareholding in UB, another person familiar with the matter said. He too declined to be named.

On June 8, the Competition Commission of India said the proposed additional stake by Heineken in United Breweries does not raise any competition concerns, thus effectively clearing the deal.

Emails sent to UBL and Heineken seeking comments for this story didn’t yield any response till the time of filing.

On May 24, in a huge relief to banks, a Prevention of Money Laundering Act court in Mumbai restored to the lenders the properties the Enforcement Directorate had seized from Mallya. The court also restored the equity that was attached by Enforcement Directorate, paving way for lenders to encash these shares. Subsequently, the DRT kicked off the recovery process.

Besides the equity holding, banks can now sell other assets belonging to Mallya that find a mention in DRT’s 2017 decree and can auction them to recover their dues. So far, the ED has attached worth of around of Rs 12,000 crores of Vijay Mallya assets, half of which has been released for recovery, including the equity holdings of Mallya, according to an official in the investigation agency. He spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The move to attach personal assets, if executed well, can set a precedent in other high-profile cases including the PNB-fraud case, Winsome Diamond case where promoters have been declared fugitive economic offenders.

Between 2016 and now, Mallya has made offers to lenders to pay back the principal component but banks have not accepted the offer. Mallya left India just hours before banks moved Supreme Court seeking his detention. Though the efforts for extradition of Mallya is on since then, there is no meaningful progress yet.

Last month, a UK Court upheld an application by a lender-consortium led by SBI to amend their bankruptcy petition, in favour of waiving their security over Mallya’s assets in India. Chief Insolvencies and Companies Court (ICC) Judge Michael Briggs handed down his judgment in favour of the banks to declare there is no public policy that prevents a waiver of security rights, as argued by Mallya’s lawyers."

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Reimbursement of expenses already incurred for COVID-19 related medical expenses shall also be provided under the scheme, the bank clarified.

""With this strategic loan scheme, our aim is to provide access to monetary assistance – especially in this difficult situation for all those who unfortunately got affected by COVID.

Linking of PAN with the Aadhaar is mandatory. If PAN and Aadhaar are not linked, then PAN will be rendered inactive and cannot be quoted for conducting specified transactions. The last date for linking PAN with Aadhaar is June 30, 2021, the tweet further stated.

The government has made several extensions to the deadline since July 2017 to facilitate the linking of the two identity numbers. And, now the last date to link these documents is June 30.

PAN is mandatory for a host of financial transactions including the opening of bank accounts, cash deposits in bank accounts, the opening of Demat accounts, transactions of immovable properties, and dealing in securities. Aadhaar is biometric-based and cannot be obtained based on any other identification document, linking the two is considered crucial for tax administration.

SBI economists on Tuesday sharply slashed their FY22 GDP growth estimates to 7.9 per cent – the lowest among all analysts – from the earlier projection of 10.4 per cent growth.

The economists at the state-run lender seemed to attribute the impact of the second wave of COVID-19 infections as a key factor for the revision in the growth estimate, and pitched for faster vaccination.

""… our analysis shows a disproportionately larger impact on the economy this time and given that rural is not as resilient as urban, the pick-up in pent-up demand is unlikely to make a large difference in FY22 GDP estimates, and hence it could only be a modest pick-up,"" they said.

The SBI economists said the increasing international commodity prices will also have an impact on the GDP growth, and added that the overall consumption trajectory will depend on the recovery in ""trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting"" services which supports roughly 25 crore households.

They, however, said that at Rs 145.8 lakh crore, the real GDP for FY22 will be “slightly higher” than those in FY20, and called it a ""W-shaped"" recovery with two troughs and not the earlier anticipated ""V-shaped"" recovery.

The RBI has maintained its growth estimate at 10.5 per cent, despite the emergence of the second wave and may have a relook at the number at this week's policy review.

Other analysts have been revising down their estimates after the devastating second wave, with an 8.5 per cent growth being lowest among the predictions.

Official data released on Monday said the economy grew at faster than expected at 1.6 per cent for the fourth quarter of FY21, resulting in a contraction of 7.3 per cent for the entire fiscal.

The high growth number in FY22 is due to the lower base, and there are concerns around whether the economy will reach the pre-pandemic levels in FY22.

The SBI economists said an ""upward bias"" to its growth estimate of 7.9 per cent is possible if the country indeed delivers on the stated aim of 1 crore vaccines a day by mid-July.

While arriving at the 7.9 per cent estimate, the SBI economists divided districts into multiple categories based on the proportion of urban population in each of the districts, and said that those districts with less than 50 per cent urban population have seen a greater increase in deaths during the second wave.

It explained that such rural pockets account for lesser economic activity, but the rural pockets are not as resilient as the urban ones when it comes to revival.

States where tier-2 centres are affected more, like Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand are likely to contribute more to the GDP loss this year, they said.

The note said there was a downward revision of growth to 10.4 per cent from the earlier 11 per cent at the beginning of the second wave, but the extension of the lockdowns beyond June in several states has resulted in a relook at the number, saying there will be a loss of Rs 4.3 lakh crore more if the activity were to normalize in July."

Big bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala expects PSU banking stocks to lead economic recovery post-pandemic amid a rise in credit growth. In an interview with Moneycontrol’s Nisha Poddar, Jhunjhunwala said he prefers Canara Bank and State Bank of India (SBI) from the space.

“The credit growth which has been 6-7 percent could go up to 15 percent. I see India growing in double-digit this year, and then next year the growth rate could be 6-10 percent, said the ace investor often dubbed India's Warren Buffett.

According to Jhunjhunwala, credit growth will pick up and public sector banks are well-provisioned and they also have deposit gathering ability.

Both Canara Bank and SBI reported strong earnings for the March 2021 quarter.

Canara Bank reported a profit of Rs 1011 crore in Q4, against a loss of Rs 3259 crore reported in the year-ago period amid a fall in provisions.

LKP Securities has a buy rating on Canara Bank with a target price of Rs 190. The bank remains upbeat on recovery from lumpy corporates in the next few quarters.

The brokerage firm believes that the government may infuse capital via recapitalisation, and the bank may raise capital from stake sales of AMC, HFC, and Insurance.

Meanwhile, the results of SBI surprised the Street. Most brokerage firms raised their target price for the public sector lender after it reported an 80 percent YoY rise in the net profit supported by a jump in net interest income, other income, and stable asset quality.

Goldman Sachs maintained its buy rating on SBI and raised the target to Rs 648 from Rs 585 earlier post Q4 results. Broking house increased earnings by 6%/11% for FY22-23. It was positively surprised in FY21 on many fronts.

Credit Suisse, in a strategy note earlier this week, highlighted that it is overweight on banks (private banks & SBI), as it believes they are the best plays on the expectation of better-than-consensus expectation of medium-term growth.

Jhunjhunwala also highlighted that State Banks of India is a very well-run bank, and if somebody wants to borrow Rs 5000 crore, it is the bank to go to.

“They are doing very well in the retail space, and their subsidiaries are doing extremely well. Nobody can match their distribution for insurance, retail or mutual funds,” explains Jhunjhunwala.

An agreement got signed on the margins of the European Union-India leaders meeting in Portugal, where both the financial institutions agreed to back the initiative, as per a statement.

SBI already invests in a vehicle called Neev Funds for its impact investing objectives, and the two entities have created 'Neev Fund II' for taking ahead this partnership. This is one of the EIB's first private equity investments in India.

Neev Fund II will provide equity to SMEs focusing on mitigating climate risks, promoting social development, job creation, and gender equality at scale, SBI chairman Dinesh Khara said.

He added that the cooperation with EIB, one of the world's largest providers of climate finance, will further strengthen and deepen the bond between India and the European Union.

The EIB and SBI will together support the new Neev Fund II investment fund that will unlock climate action and sustainability investment by businesses across India through new equity financing.

Under the management of SBICap Ventures, an SBI group company, Neev Fund II will invest up to Euro 100 million in Indian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and provide growth and expansion capital to companies offering solutions for clean energy, electric vehicles, efficient use of raw materials, and water and circular economy projects in the country, the statement said.

The fund will enable Indian innovative and emerging companies to fund their growth through equity or quasi-equity instruments, it added.

Innovative solutions often require innovative forms of financing, such as private equity funds. Our partnership with the State Bank of India will create a much-needed source of equity financing for climate action and environmental sustainability solutions offered by innovative SMEs, EIB's head of operations in India, Christian Kettel Thomsen, said.

SBI Ventures' managing director and chief executive Suresh Kozhikote said the Neev Fund generates commercially attractive returns while making a significant positive contribution to society.

Neev Fund II will provide equity and quasi-equity to SMEs (Small and medium-sized enterprises), targeting sectors that support the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly aiming to limit climate change through energy, agricultural, water, and waste management technologies.

This could include businesses offering solutions for the development of new technology for climate change, environmental protection, electric vehicles, and any other innovative products and services that could benefit climate action across the world, the statement said."

If all lenders come on board, the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARC) announced in the budget will be able to aggregate 100 per cent of a sick company''s outstanding loans, which shall ultimately lead to better resolution of the asset quality stress for all.

The government is yet to announce the specific contours of the NARC or the bad bank and has also only said that it is willing to provide some sovereign guarantee to help the platform.

""For this model to succeed, it cannot just be mostly for public sector banks. Yes, they will take a lead role in this but as we understand at this point of time, NARC will be all encompassing. It will take into account PSBs, private sector banks and for that matter any financial institution which has an exposure to the identified account,” Swaminathan said, speaking at an online seminar.

The present set of over two dozen ARCs have not been able to achieve decent numbers on debt aggregation and get stuck under 40 per cent in many cases, which has a bearing on the final resolution as well, he said.

""This ARC (the bad bank), since it is mandated and backed by the government, it is going to be a smoother affair in terms of all the banks deciding together to transfer the entire asset. Which means that the aggregation is going to be near 100 pc and there is going to be an AMC structure. So, together, we expect this to be a winning formula,"" the confident SBI executive said.

""We are ''very close'' for the bad bank to be a reality"" and added that the dual structure of being both an asset reconstruction company as well as an asset management company will be of help, he said.

At present, financial industry stakeholders are being reached out to gauge their interest and one of the entities will take the lead once the potential shareholders are in place.

The lead bank or financier will have a stake of over 100 per cent, and apply to the RBI for licence to operate as an ARC, he said, stressing that funding or capital is not a problem for the bad bank.

The bad bank will operate on the prevalent 15:85 structure, where only 15 per cent will be paid as cash and the rest would be security receipts, he said, adding that this model will ensure that the fund initial fund requirements are not very high.

He said there is a group within the country''s largest lender working out a slew of modalities, including the potential assets which can be transferred to the NARC, capital required etc.

One of the unanswered aspects which will eventually get solved is the ways to put a value to the government guarantee which will ride alongside the security receipts.

Explaining the ways of working, he said NARC will offer a specific price for an asset to the banks and await the nod from the joint lenders forum to go ahead with a resolution. Once the amount is quoted, the lenders can reach out to other ARCs in the system and NARC will have the opportunity to revise its bid as well, he said, adding that there is a scope for price discovery.

A majority of lenders will have to be on board before the asset is transferred to NARC, he said, adding that the definition of ''majority'' is likely to be the one as done by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code."

The country's largest lender SBI on Monday announced allocating Rs 71 crore towards the fight against COVID-19, a part of which will be used to set up a makeshift 1,000-bed hospital for the treatment of patients in some of the worst-affected states.

State Bank of India (SBI) has allocated Rs 71 crore to undertake various support initiatives to combat the second wave of COVID-19, SBI said in a release.

The state-owned lender has allocated Rs 30 crore for a makeshift hospital while Rs 21 crore will be used to support initiatives such as procurement of life-saving healthcare equipment, oxygen supply to hospitals, Covid-care centres, ambulances, PPE kits, masks as well as food relief efforts.

Besides, Rs 10 crore will be used to supplement government's effort in genome sequencing, and Rs 10 crore will be earmarked to collaborate with on-ground NGOs to address the community needs, SBI said.

The bank will continue to serve citizens through its extensive network of over 22,000 branches. The facilities would be set up in collaboration with government hospitals and municipal corporations of the needy cities.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

SBI is in talks with various designated authorities to explore partnerships for setting up makeshift hospitals. Among others, SBI has tied up with various hospitals for vaccination of its employees and their dependent family members.

State Bank of India (SBI) will try to keep the interest rates benign as long as possible with a view to supporting the economic growth, its chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara has said.

On the impact of the second wave of COVID-19 on non-performing assets of the bank, the SBI chief said that as the lockdown was not pan-India, one will have to wait and watch to assess its impact on the banking sector.

Observing that multiple variables including inflation have a bearing on the interest rates, he said, ""our effort is to support the growth initiatives. To really ensure that happens, we will try to keep the soft interest rate regime for as long as possible.""

In an interview to PTI, Khara said it is too early to give any colour to likely scenario of NPAs because of local restrictions.

The impact of lockdown differ from states to states as it is not uniform, he said, adding, ""so, probably we can wait and watch for some more time before making any comment on impact on economy and NPA situation.""

Speaking about various initiatives of the country''s largest lender, Khara said, SBI has decided to set up makeshift hospitals with ICU facilities for COVID-19 patients in some of the worst affected states.

The bank has already earmarked Rs 30 crore and is engaging with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and hospital management for setting up medical facilities on an emergency basis for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

As per information posted on its website, the new rate effective April 1 is 6.95 percent. Compared to the limited period teaser rate, the new rate is 25 basis points higher.

“We request our esteemed customers to bear with us as we upgrade our digital banking platforms to provide a better online banking experience,” the bank tweeted on Thursday morning. During this time, the bank’s digital banking platform YONO and UPI services will not be available, the bank said.

SBI isn’t the only bank which has faced technical snags on digital platforms in recent past. On Tuesday, HDFC Bank reported issues in its digital banking channels. The bank later said that the issue is resolved."

JBIC is a policy-based financial institution, wholly owned by the Japanese government, with the objective of contributing to the sound development of Japan, the international economy and society, it said.

“At a time when people are preferring personal mode of transport, this collaboration between SBI and JBIC will help the bank in extending loan facility to entire supply chain of Japanese automobile industry including suppliers, dealers and ultimately to the end users,” SBI Chairman Dinesh Khara said.

A slew of Japanese companies dominate the Indian auto sector, including Maruti Suzuki, Toyota Kirloskar and Honda.

A virtual agreement signing ceremony was held in the presence of Khara, senior executives of SBI, JBIC''s deputy governor Hayashi Nobumitsu, and Maruti Suzuki''s chief executive and managing director Ayukawa Kenichi, it said.

The financing will assist in ''Make in India'' initiative as well, the statement said."

The country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on March 16 said it had inked the first deal in the external commercial borrowing (ECB) market using the new Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). SBI and Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) have inked a $100 million deal for five years, the bank said in a statement.

SOFR is the new alternative benchmark rate which will replace LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), which is the existing benchmark rate. SOFR will replace LIBOR by end of 2021. The sunset has been triggered by the decision of Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK not to compel contributing banks for LIBOR calculation after December 2021.

“It is the first SOFR deal in the ECB space and the transaction demonstrates SBI’s position as a leader in aligning its systems and processes to embrace Alternate Reference Rates (ARRs),” said C Venkat Nageswar, Deputy Managing Director (International Banking Group).

“IOCL, the largest public sector Oil Marketing Company in India, by availing the first SOFR linked ECB, will set the pace for smooth transition by Indian Corporates to ARR mechanism,” Nageswar said.

“This is a first step, albeit an important one, in our quest to gear up for the impending transition from LIBOR to Alternate Reference Rates. This will also facilitate in efficiently tapping the funding opportunities provided by the ECB market in future,” said Sandeep Kumar Gupta, Director (Finance), IOCL.

On January 20, SBI said it executed two inter-bank short-term money market deal with pricing linked to SOFR. Similarly, on January 21, ICICI Bank said it executed the first interbank money market transaction linked with SOFR. The transaction, executed through the Bank’s Hong Kong branch, is part of the Bank’s Benchmark Transition Management plan to assess the preparedness towards a smooth transition to the new Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs), the bank said.

The FCA said the LIBOR will cease to exist immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of all sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings, and the 1-week and 2-month US dollar settings and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining US dollar settings. After these dates, the representative LIBOR rates will no longer be available.

The FCA is the conduct regulator for nearly 60,000 financial services firms and financial markets in the UK and the prudential supervisor for 49,000 firms, setting specific standards for 19,000 firms. Further, the FCA has confirmed it does not expect any LIBOR settings to become unrepresentative before these intended cessation dates, given the undertakings received from the panel banks."

Presenting the Budget on February 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the privatisation of two public sector banks (PSBs) as part of the government's disinvestment plan.

The government has already privatised IDBI Bank by selling its majority stake in the lender to LIC in 2019 and has merged 14 public sector banks in the last four years.

Why are they protesting?

The employee unions fear that the move to privatise PSU banks will lead to job losses. The two sides also held talks but failed to find common ground. with bank unions insisting that the government rollback the privatisation proposal.

Conciliation meetings - before the Additional Chief Labour Commissioner on March 4, 9 and 10 - did not yield any positive result, so the strike stands, All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) general secretary C H Venkatachalam said.

The State Bank of India (SBI) will conduct e-auctions of 12 bad accounts in March to recover dues of over Rs 506 crore under sale to asset reconstruction company (ARC) mechanism. 'In terms of the bank's policy on sale of financial assets, in line with the regulatory guidelines, we place these accounts for sale to ARCs/banks/NBFCs /FIs, on the terms and conditions indicated there against,' SBI said in sale notifications. Here’s an explainer on the e-auction process and what it means for investors.

How does an e-auction work?

Banks auction such properties in a final attempt to recover whatever value is left out of these assets. In most cases, banks suffer loss in such auctions but that’s still better than the entire money going bad. Banks inform the auction date well in advance so that interested bidders can participate.

Who can bid?

Any Indian resident can bid for these properties.

How does the process begin?

According to SBI website, the process begins when the respective Branches of SBI publishes the advertisement in the leading newspapers (English and Vernacular). The advertisements are also published in Social Media (like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc.). This happens, when recovery notices do not yield adequate responses.

This advertisement contains the details of websites where the prospective bidders can access the particulars of locations of the properties with full details. It also guides the prospective bidders on the pre-requirements for participating in e-auction.

How can bidders participate?

Interested bidders will have to deposit 10 percent of the reserve money in advance to participate in the auction. This is called the earnest deposit money. There will be a reserve price for each asset that the bank decides. The highest bidder will get the right to acquire the property.

What kind of properties are put up for auction by banks?

Banks auction all types of properties where repayments have been defaulted. These could be residential properties, commercial properties, vehicles or even factory equipment.

How can investors see the details of the auction properties?

Potential buyers can view the details of such properties put up for e-auctions through the links provided in the advertisement. There is a designated contact person also for auction at the Branches whom prospective Buyers may approach for any clarification regarding the auction process and the property he /she is interested in and may inspect the properties of their interest, the bank says.

Is it a good opportunity for buyers?

Through bank auctions, investors can get up to 20-30 percent discount to the market price. Hence, such deals make sense for investors. Many a time, such properties are located at prime locations and, for investors, this presents a good opportunity.

What are the risks?

Some caution is warranted. To begin with, these are properties where borrowers have defaulted on their bank loans and where the bank has initiated recovery proceedings. There is a possibility that some of these properties may be caught in litigation. Hence, bidders need to first verify the details of the property before bidding for such properties, according to experts.

Will there be legal challenges on such properties?

Normally, these are bank attached properties and hence shouldn’t offer any legal risks for the buyer. But, the buyer needs to check if it is a jointly owned property and needs to be prepared for legal challenges if any other joint property holders move court. The buyer needs to also check whether the auction property is already occupied by a party and if the tenants/ occupants are willing to vacate the property post purchase.

How often banks e-auction properties?

Banks frequently announce e auctions of loan default properties. Such auctions can happen multiple times in a year."

BNP Paribas Cardiff has launched a share sale in SBI Life Insurance which could potentially signal the exit of the French insurance giant from the state-owned insurer and mark the end of a nearly two-decade-old joint venture, sources with knowledge of the matter told Moneycontrol.

SBI Life Insurance was set up in 2001 as a joint venture between State Bank of India and BNP Paribas Cardiff. It debuted on the domestic bourses in October 2017.

On December 4, 2020, Moneycontrol was the first to report that BNP Paribas Cardiff was evaluating the sale of its balance stake in SBI Life Insurance via a block deal.

“BNP Paribas has launched the block deal today,” an individual told Moneycontrol. A second individual confirmed the same.

According to the current shareholding pattern, the French firm, which falls in the promoter category, holds 5.2 percent stake which is valued at Rs 4,888 crore at current market price. The SBI Life Insurance stock had hit 52-week high earlier this week after registering a strong growth in new business premiums in February.

Both the individuals above spoke to Moneycontrol on the condition of anonymity. Moneycontrol could not immediately connect with BNP Paribas Cardiff and SBI Life Insurance for an immediate comment.

According to the terms of the deal accessed by Bloomberg, BNP Paribas is selling 35 million (or around 3.5 percent) SBI Life Insurance shares which are being offered at Rs 870 to Rs 917 each. This represents a 2.5 percent to 7.5 percent discount to MArch 9’s closing price of Rs 940.75.

There is an option to increase the deal size by about 15 million shares (1.5 percent) and BNP Paribas is the sole broker on the deal. If the upsize option is exercised, then BNP Paribas would be left with a miniscule 0.2 percent stake.

The BNP Paribas-SBI Life Saga

BNP Paribas, which is a specialist in personal insurance and had gross written premiums of 29.8 billion euros in 2019 has been gradually paring its stake in SBI Life Insurance over the last few years.

In June 2019, BNP Paribas Cardiff had offloaded 2.5 percent stake in SBI Life Insurance for about Rs 1,625 crore. Earlier, In March 2019, it had sold 5 percent and 9.2 percent for Rs 2,889 crore and Rs 4,751 crore, respectively, in the life insurer.

Commanding an individual market share of 11.7 percent, by the end of the first half of this fiscal year, SBI Life Insurance is a market leader and has recently seen an improvement in business premium, policy retention and the ULIP business.

An earlier report by brokerage firm Motilal Oswal had said: “We expect SBI Life Insurance to continue to deliver good persistency and renewal growth. At the same time, it should maintain its cost leadership.”

BNP Paribas Cardiff is a leading global player in bancassurance partnerships and creditor insurance. It co-creates solutions with almost 500 partner distributors in a variety of sectors (including banks and financial institutions, automotive sector companies, retailers, telecommunications companies, energy companies, among others), as well as financial advisors and brokers who market the products to their customers.

It has a presence in 33 countries and strong positions in three regions – Europe, Asia and Latin America."

National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) on March 5 announced that they have tied-up with SBI Payments to launch ‘RuPay SoftPoS’ for millions of Indian merchants.

Through the new move, NCPI is aiming to provide innovative solution to transform NFC-enabled smartphones into merchant Point of Sale (PoS) terminals for the retailers. By using this, the merchant would be able to accept contactless payments of up to Rs 5,000 through a simple tap and pay mechanism on their smartphones.

NPCI upgrading IT systems across platforms, anticipates 1 billion daily transactions: Report

The cost for using the RuPay SoftPoS to retailers will be nominal. Also, the mechanism, NPCI claims, will proliferate digital payment acceptance among millions of underserved Indian MSMEs. By downloading the app, merchants would now be able to convert their existing android smartphone devices into a payment terminal.

NPCI claims that the new app would revolutionise the way micro and small merchants receive payments. Apart from this, the app would help the merchants shift to accept secure, contactless digital payments instead of dealing with cash.

How it works:

1) A merchant will first have to download the app on his/her Android smartphone.

2) To receive money, one has to choose the contactless menu and enter an appropriate amount.

3) The RuPay card can then be tapped on the merchant’s mobile for contactless transaction.

4) If the transaction gets approved, the receipt of successful transaction will be generated in real time.

5) NCMC cards and RuPay Tokenized Card on mobile can use the facility to make payments in a secure and time efficient manner.

""We are delighted to partner with SBI to launch the RuPay SoftPoS solution aimed at creating an innovative payment solution for Indian MSMEs which forms the backbone of our economy. It is our endeavour to ensure that merchants from various geographies of the nation are on boarded into the ecosystem in order to deepen the penetration of digital acceptance infrastructure in the country. It is our belief that this is a step in the right direction of financial inclusivity as RuPay SoftPoS can provide an impetus to the digital on-boarding of merchants across the length and breadth of the country,"" LiveMint quoted NPCI COO Praveena Rai as saying."

A super specialty hospital in Andhra Pradesh, 1.46 acres of commercial land in Tamil Nadu along with 51,160 square feet of hotel building are among the properties that will be auctioned by country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), this month. SBI will conduct what it calls a mega e-auction on March 5 (Friday).

According to Indian banks auction properties information website, which displays the details of properties that are put up for auction by different banks, SBI has notified a total of 522 properties for auctions in the month of March alone. Of these, 316 are residential properties and 109 are commercial properties, 70 are industrial properties and 27 are other entries including tourist vehicles. These include houses, land plots, factory units and motor vehicles etc.

Some of these properties are located in prime areas. The list of auction properties include names like Palaparthy Super Speciality Hospital in Andhra Pardesh, along with its all medical equipment and fixed assets. SBI has kept a reserve price of Rs 91.3 crore for the property for the auction that is scheduled to happen on March 5.

Interested bidders will have to deposit 10 percent of the reserve money in advance to participate in the auction. Similarly, SBI will auction Hotel Milestonnez Pvt Ltd, in Kancheepuam Tamil Nadu and has kept a reserve price of Rs 27.04 crore for the property, according to the IBAPI website.

Reserve price is the minimum price that can be bid by prospective purchasers. Bank will not sell the auction properties below that price. To participate in the auction for a particular property, the bidders need to deposit a certain amount, say 10 percent of the reserve value upfront which is called EMD (Earnest money deposit).

Is buying bank auction properties a good idea?

Banks auction such properties in a final attempt to recover whatever value is left out of these assets. In most cases, banks suffer loss in such auctions but that’s still better than the entire money going bad. Through bank auctions, investors can get up to 20-30 percent discount to the market price. Hence, such deals make sense for investors.

There is a possibility that some of these properties may be caught in litigations. Hence, bidders need to first verify the details of the property before bidding for such properties, according to experts.

“Mostly, in these auctions, only professionals participate. These are people really in a position to assess such properties. It is not everybody’s game,” said Naresh Malhotra, former SBI banker and a senior banking consultant. “But, retail buyers can look at such properties after doing proper due diligence,” Malhotra added.

How does the process begin?

According to SBI website, the process begins when the respective Branches of SBI publishes the advertisement in the leading newspapers (English and Vernacular). The advertisements are also published in Social Media (like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc.). This happens, when recovery notices do not yield adequate responses.

This advertisement contains the details of websites where the prospective bidders can access the particulars of locations of the properties with full details. It also guides the prospective bidders on the pre-requirements for participating in e-auction.

“We at SBI are very transparent when putting immovable properties, mortgaged with the Bank / attached by Court order to auction, by furnishing all the relevant details that can make it an attractive proposition for bidders to participate in the auctions,” the bank said.

“We also incorporate all relevant details and state whether the same is freehold or leasehold, give its measurement, location etc., including other relevant details in the public notices issued for auctioning,” the bank added.

Potential buyers can view the details of such properties put up for e-auctions through the links provided in the advertisement. There is designated contact person also for auction at the Branches whom prospective Buyers may approach to for any clarification regarding the auction process and the property he /she is interested in and may inspect the properties of their interest, the bank says.

Are buying these properties risky?

What are the areas one needs to be cautious while buying such properties? As mentioned above, the buyers need to be watchful of legal tussles involving such titles. Also, there may be cases where one property is owned by multiple individuals or entities.

Banks may auction the property following defaults by any one of the parties. And the buyer needs to be prepared for legal challenges if any other partners move court, said another Mumbai-based banker who didn’t want to be named. The buyer needs to also check whether the auction property is already occupied by a party and if the tenants/ occupants are willing to vacate the property post purchase.

“Still, these are the least risky assets because banks do the due diligence and once you pay up the money, the transfer happens immediately,” said Malhotra."

State Bank of India (SBI), on March 1, said it had contributed Rs 11 crore to the PM CARES fund to support India's COVID-19 vaccination programme.

""It is at times of adversity that the true form of unity is tested, and we all can take pride in the efforts that our nation has put in to fight the pandemic. The fight against the pandemic is not yet over, and as a responsible Corporate Citizen, we consider it our duty to support the government's efforts to vaccinate all. I request everyone to come forward and help in whatever way they can to ensure a successful vaccination drive,"" SBI Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said.

""Early last year, SBI had committed 0.25 percent of its annual profit to support the fight against COVID-19 and also made significant contributions in the form of supply of masks, sanitizers among others to the needy,"" SBI said.

In addition to this, SBI employees contributed Rs 107 crore to the PM CARES fund in 2020.

The Prime Minister's Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARES) Fund was set up in March 2020 to gather funds for relief during the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

India's vaccination programme began on January 16. The government plans to inoculate 300 million (30 crore) people by August."

The State Bank of India (SBI) is “evaluating options” to enter the aircraft leasing business in India, a senior official from the bank told The Economic Times.

“We are evaluating options to handle aircraft leasing business in GIFT City subject to regulatory approvals and viability,” Ashwini Tewari, managing director – international banking, technology and subsidiaries at SBI, told the paper.

The decision comes after the Union Budget 2021 announced incentives for aircraft leasing companies to open offices in GIFT City (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City) near Ahmedabad.

Other sources told the paper that India largest public sector lender is “looking for a foreign partner for the proposed venture.”

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

“SBI does not have the expertise of running an aircraft leasing business and the bank is looking for a foreign partner that has the expertise in the sector,” one source said.

SBI’s venture into the sector would not be a wholly unheard of move, earlier the Bank of China entered the segment as part of the Chinese Government’s plan to develop the country as an aircraft leasing hub, the report noted.

Since then, Bank of China has become the largest of such a leasing company in the world, including India, where it is third in terms of number of aircrafts leased – 25 to various airlines."

"February 26, 2021 11:25 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/city-survival-tip-for-birds-dont-be-a-picky-eater-6581251.html,"Scientists reviewed 226 papers published between 1979 and 2020 to determine what traits influence bird survival in a city. (PC- Mongabay/Ashwani Sharma)





Urban avifauna is dominated by generalist species while the specialists are on a decline, finds the study.



Certain bird species in cities are smaller in size compared to their counterparts in non-urban areas, are stressed and are more aggressive in nature.



City planners need to rethink design, protect patches of native vegetation and water bodies to preserve the bird diversity in cities.



Eat everything, nest anywhere and be like Beyonce when singing for a companion. If a city bird were to give a country bird the top 10 survival techniques in a city, the first up on the list would be to not be a picky eater, followed by lowering nesting expectations and working on developing the vocal range. Omnivores have a higher chance of surviving in a city where the food sources are not so diverse but abundant, says a study by scientists to determine what traits influence bird survival in a city.

The scientists reviewed 226 papers that were published between 1979 and 2020 and aggregated information on five major groups of bird traits from around the world that have been widely studied: ecological traits, life history, physiology, behaviour and genetic traits. “There is a growing interest in bird watching among people which has sparked a citizen science movement to monitor birds around the country,” said Kulbhushansingh Suryawanshi, a scientist at Nature Conservation Foundation and Director, India Program of Snow Leopard Trust, who co-authored the study with researchers Swaroop Patankar, Ravi Jambhekar and Harini Nagendra.

Suryawanshi said that the State of India’s Birds Report published a year ago found that half of the 867 species that were assessed showed a decline over the past two decades. Since India is rapidly urbanising, there is a push from the central government to make our cities into ‘smart cities’. “We know very little about how these changes will affect bird diversity and abundance. This is an early effort to work in that direction,” he said.

One of the key findings of the study is that generalist species dominate the urban bird community while specialists show a decline in number. This could be due to a lack of specific food and shelter resources in urban areas, suggest the authors of the study. Certain cultural practices seem to influence the population of some species. For example, in India, the tradition of grain merchants to give a small portion of their goods to granivorous birds for good luck or meat being offered to scavenging birds as a religious practice in Delhi could favour the population of certain bird species like black kites (Milvus migrans) and house sparrows (Passer domesticus).

Three new leafhopper species described in India

Birds need to adapt, have limited nesting choices

Be it humans, animals or birds, adaptability seems to be the key characteristic that makes city life enjoyable. The study found that those species of birds that make cities home are highly adaptable and get used to human activity and the perils of urbanisation. “The key differences (city bird vs country bird) are those which help them survive in cities. These include loss of fear of humans, neophilia, which is the willingness to explore novel food resources, higher aggression towards other species, change in song structure, higher clutch sizes etc.,” said Swaroop Patankar of Azim Premji University who co-authored the study. She, however, said it would be wrong to generalise these changes as different species differ, according to their inherent characteristics.

Not just their diets, nesting choices too play a part in determining how well birds adapt to urbanisation. Birds that use a variety of nesting strategies like nesting on artificial structures like buildings are more likely to do better in urban areas as compared to birds with specialised nesting preferences, stated the study. Birds that nest on-ground are the most affected by urbanisation while those that nest on high trees and in tree cavities have a better chance of survival in cities.

City birds sing louder and at more opportune times

Another striking survival trait of urban birds is the altered frequency and amplitude of their songs. In urban areas, low-frequency noise levels like that of traffic are high. This noise masks bird songs resulting in poor song transmission and hence, poor reproductive success. Urban birds are seen to modify song and call structure to overcome the hurdle. While some bird species sing at a higher frequency in areas with high anthropogenic noise levels, some other species like great tits and Eurasian blackbirds increase the amplitude of their songs, a phenomenon called “Lombard effect”, in order to be heard above the city noises. On the other hand, birds like European robins (Erithacus rubecula) choose to sing in the night to avoid song masking, says the study.

Physiologically too, urban birds seem to differ from their rural counterparts. Reduced body fat and larger brain size are some of the distinctive features of certain urban bird species, according to the review. And surprise, surprise! The city birds are as stressed as the humans if the increased level of plasma corticosterone hormone (CORT) secretion in some of the birds is any indication. An increase in the clutch size and brood size has also been noticed, perhaps to overcome the losses that occur during predation or the effects of urbanisation, such as mortality caused due to collision with cars or windows.

“The species which stand to lose the most from urbanisation are highly habitat-specific species like hornbills, which require mature forests with large trees for survival and lark and pipit species, which require grassland habitat,” said Patankar adding that some species of hornbills do differently. “Indian grey hornbills are seen to thrive in urban areas where there are large old trees present, as they make their nests in the trunk cavities of these trees,” she said.

So who really are the birds of a feather slaying the city life? Researchers said that black kites, rock pigeons, mynas, and house crows are found to be adapting well to city life. Certain species of flycatchers and warblers or garden birds like tailorbird, prinias and munias prefer to occupy urban green spaces. “Frugivores such as rose-ringed parakeets and barbets are doing well in cities that have fruiting trees and old trees which provide nesting and roosting habitats. So are the pelicans and painted storks and some species of ibises in managed urban wetlands. Peacocks are doing well in peri-urban landscapes. Barn owls are also successful in cities. They are also doing an important service by preying on rodents,” said Suryawanshi.

Plan cities better to support biodiversity, say researchers

Various ecosystem services that the birds provide apart, one can’t deny that it is magical to wake up to bird songs whether you are in a city or a village. If Indian cities were to harbour diverse species of birds, said the researchers, we need to maintain those remaining patches of native vegetation and small lakes and ponds and control urban predators of birds such as dogs, cats and rodents. “City planners need to understand the importance of designing suitable urban green spaces, which are not just aesthetically pleasing, but also support biodiversity,” said Patankar.

She said that manicured lawns, ornamental plants and trees will not do the trick but more fruiting and flowering trees and trees which provide good nesting sites as banyan (Ficus benghalensis) and peepal (Ficus religiosa) will. Another city design that is hurting the urban birds is the use of tinted glass windows on buildings—flying birds see their reflection in them and try to attack which leads to serious injury. “Protecting patches of native vegetation and water bodies is perhaps the most important thing that city planners can do,” said Suryawanshi adding, “Very often we see lakes and parks getting ‘developed’ where native vegetation is replaced with exotic plants and green lawns. This needs changing. Citizens need to use these spaces, but the vegetation that gets planted should be native and designed in a way to help maintain biodiversity.”

State Bank of India (SBI), in a big move, has transferred its full ATM network to a Multi-vendor Software (MVS) solution implemented by India’s leading Payment Solutions Company CMS Info Systems (CMS). This is a seven-year contract worth over Rs 500 crore for CMS.

Here are the benefits SBI has from Multi-vendor ATM software

-40,000 SBI ATM network now running successfully as the unique solution was customized for SBI.

-The multi-vendor Software (MVS) solution is helping the bank centralize their ATM Channel Management to a single central command control which can be used to enhance the customer experience as well as ensure the network has the latest security measures.

-SBI is now able to leverage VMS to update its network in real-time which could earlier take months. It can also use the ATM channel to customize offers to its customers.

-It also offers SBI the option of enhancing MVS so that it can be used across its entire self-service terminals to provide a unified, connected customer experience to their customers.

-As vendor-agnostic software, banks can gain considerable cost and operational advantages by being able to procure ATM hardware and software components separately without the dependency of being tied to one vendor for both.

Aiming for growth in acceptance of digital payments in Tier 3, 4 and North Eastern cities, SBI Payments, subsidiary of India’s largest bank, State Bank of India, is targeting 20 million potential merchants in the Retail and Enterprise segment.

Commenting on the launch, SBI Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said in a press release, “It gives me immense pleasure to announce the launch of YONO SBI Merchant app by our Digital Payments subsidiary SBI Payments. The Bank launched YONO Platform three years ago, and has 35.8 million registered users. YONO Merchant is a brand extension of this platform aiming to improve user experience and bringing convenience to our merchants.”

“In the next 2-3 years, we are aiming to digitize millions of merchants by upgrading their mobile phones into a PoS device accepting all form factors, accessing Value Added Services such as loyalty, GST invoicing, inventory management, etc and connecting into an interface to avail other banking products at a click of a button,” Khara added.

SBI has also partnered with Visa on the Tap to Phone feature for boost acceptance infrastructure across the country.

With India’s smartphone base expected to reach 820 million in the next two years, both SBI and Visa firmly believe there is a tremendous opportunity to augment them as payment acceptance devices, a press release by the company has stated.

The mobile app will also be capable of allowing merchants to access details of transactions, generate reports, upload transactions for processing etc.

With digitisation of the country in full swing, there are already competitors in the market such as Paytm, Google Pay and PhonePe among many others. Most of these apps, too, allow for seamless merchant app processes, but penetration into Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities is still somewhat lacking."

Often, the State Bank of India (SBI) is called the ‘elephant’ among Indian banks. That's because of its sheer size (total assets of Rs 43.6 lakh crore as of December) and market dominance.

In one of his interviews in 2010, former SBI Chairman O P Bhatt famously said his team at the bank showed that the elephant can dance, referring to the improvement in business at that point. A decade later, the elephant has shown it can dance, yet again!

On Thursday, the country’s largest bank said it's home loan portfolio has crossed Rs 5 lakh crore in the home loan business. It now controls one-third of the home loan market in the country. Within SBI, home loans currently constitute over 23 percent of the total loan book and has the biggest share in domestic advances followed by infrastructure loans and industry loans.

There is a clear shift to safer retail loans. That's what any smart banker would do in a pandemic-hit market that was already facing an economic slowdown.

SBI has bet big on retail loans, and within that, home loans. In the next five years, the bank wants to double its home loan portfolio. That looks doable given the current momentum and track record. SBI began its home loan business in 2004 with a total portfolio of Rs17,000 crore.

A separate Real Estate and Housing Business Unit came into being in 2012 with a total portfolio of Rs one lakh crore. By 2014, SBI became a market leader in the home loan segment.

Its nearest mortgage loan competitors-- HDFC, ICICI Bank, and LIC Housing Finance—are still far below. According to SBI’s investor presentation, total home loan sanctions have grown by 25 percent in December compared with 7 percent in the previous month. One major reason for this could also be the stamp duty cuts in December which resulted in a spur in fresh loan disbursals. The year-on-year growth in this segment is about 10 percent.

SBI’s numbers are impressive for a state-owned bank that is traditionally perceived as less aggressive than its private-sector competitors and operate within the constraints of Government ownership.

SBI currently has a market share of 34 percent in the home loan market and is offering one of the lowest rates on home loans in the market at 6.8 percent. On average, the bank gets 1000 new home loan borrowers every single day and in recent years, has significantly ramped up its digital presence through the YONO App.

What works for the bank?

SBI is as aggressive in business approach as its private sector counterparts. Not just in home loans, but in other retail segments such as auto loans as well. In Auto loans, SBI has a market share of 33 percent at the end of December. Being the largest in the industry, SBI commands a leadership position and even sets the trend for competitors on pricing.

The recent management transition has so far worked well for the bank. The bank recently got two new managing directors (MDs)--Swaminathan Janakiraman and Aswini Kumar Tewari -- not long after it got a new Chairman, Dinesh Kumar Khara. The business approach and corporate governance standards are aggressive and efficient unlike some of its peers in the public sector.

""Their management style is impeccable. it is a well-oiled machine,"" said a senior banker requesting not to be named.

SBI has managed to grow its home loan book despite the Covid challenge. It has totally waived the processing fee till March 2021 for customers availing home loans in SBI approved projects, is looking at implementing AI, Cloud, Blockchain, machine learning to boost its businesses, and is gearing up to initiate a co-lending model to reach out to the unorganized sector.

Also, SBI is engaging in collaboration with builders so that it can offer more choices of homes to home buyers. The bank is consistently ingraining the latest technology into its operational and delivery platforms to make the home loan journey smoother for customers.

Home loans make even bigger sense for banks in the current market environment. This segment has the lowest default rate among categories. In SBI’s case, the gross NPAs is just 0.67 percent of the total book. Not just SBI, most lenders are now shifting to low-risk retail loans from lumpy corporate loans.

In November last year, ICICI Bank said it managed record home loan sales despite the pandemic challenges. Its loan portfolio crossed Rs 2 lakh crore in November. Unlike personal loans, which are largely unsecured, home loans are backed by collateral and are secured assets. Banks are also not keen to lend more to high-risk infrastructure projects—power and telecommunications—in particular, due to the fear of further addition of bad loans.

In Q3, the SBI has shown an overall improvement in business performance, most notably asset quality. The gross non-performing assets (NPA) as a percentage of gross advances at 4.77 percent in Q3FY21 declined 51 bps sequentially and the net NPA at 1.23 percent fell 36 bps Q-o-Q. All segments of loan books reported a decline in NPA Q-o-Q with NPA from the corporate book down 35 bps and retail 62 bps. However, one must note that on a proforma basis without reference to the Supreme Court interim order, the gross NPA would have been at 5.44 percent and net NPA at 1.81 percent in Q3FY21.

Still, for banks like SBI, the slippage trend is positive. The fresh slippages were sharply lower at Rs 237 crore for the quarter ended December 2020, compared with Rs 3,085 crore in the previous quarter, but proforma slippages for Q3FY21 were at Rs 2,073 crore and proforma slippages for nine months at Rs 16,461 crore, said SBI. Slippages ratio declined significantly to 0.04 percent at the end of December quarter 2020, compared with 0.46 percent in Q2FY21 and 2.94 percent in Q3FY20, the bank added.

The NPA numbers have cheered the investors.

With its sharp retail focus, a likely uptick in the economy, and a smooth management transition, SBI is likely to continue as an outlier among PSBs, most of which are laggards."

India's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) is providing home loans at interest rates as low as starting at 6.80 percent per annum. State Bank of India (SBI) has reached another landmark by crossing the Rs 5 trillion (5 Lakh crore) mark in its home loan segment maintaining its leadership in the home loan segment intact.

For customers availing home loans in SBI approved projects, the bank has completely waived the processing fee till March 2021.

The bank said it is also working on themes like focused development of the Home Loan business, refined analytics for boosting growth, easing home loan journey for customers, and post disbursal engagement with home loan customers.

34 percent of the market share in the home loan segment is commanded by the SBI. The bank onboards around 1000 home loan customers per day on average.

Under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) till December 2020, the SBI has issued nearly two lakh home loans. Ministry of Housing and Urban Development has designated SBI as the Central Nodal Agency for processing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) subsidy.

""To support the government’s flagship program of ‘Housing for all by 2022’, SBI has been continuously extending home loans under PMAY and has sanctioned 1,94,582 home loans as of December 2020,"" SBI said in a statement.

The bank further added ""SBI is also the only bank designated by MoHUA (Ministry of Housing and Urban Development) as the Central Nodal Agency (CNA) for processing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) subsidy. To support Govt’s flagship program of ‘Housing for all by 2022’, SBI has been continuously extending home loans under PMAY and has sanctioned 1,94,582 home loans as of December 2020"".

SBI is gearing up to initiate a co-lending model for home loans which will help boost SBI’s footprints in the unorganized sector. With the use of cutting-edge technology, a vast network of branches, dedicated to Central Processing Centers (CPCs) in 215 centers, bank’s digital and lifestyle platform, YONO, and other enablers, SBI has hit Rs. 5 trillion marks in the home loan business, the bank said.

“It is a momentous achievement for State Bank of India. This extraordinary feat is a testament to customers’ continuous trust in the bank. We feel that combining technology with personalized service is the key in the current scenario.

""The bank is also working on various digital initiatives to improve the efficiencies in home loan delivery including a unique integrated platform Retail Loan Management System (RLMS) which will provide an end-to-end digital solution. We are also happy to express that SBI has become the market leader in home loans by adopting a focused approach and acknowledging it as a national priority.

""We have always treated home loans as a growth driver for the nation and not just as mere transactions. We, at SBI, will continue focusing on enhancing customer delight that will in-turn enable the bank to scale newer heights.” Dinesh Khara, Chairman, SBI said."

A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

A definitive conclusion came from the re-estimated CPI headline in April and May using Paasche’s Index showed inflation numbers were on average 120 bps lower than NSO numbers.

SBI has computed the April-November 2020 CPI average at 6.3 percent, compared to NSO’s estimated 6.9 percent.

>> December CPI inflation: Trends showed that non-essential spends jumped up by 65 percent in December 2020 – but only because of fuel spend. SBI’s calculated CPI inflation for the month is at 5 percent, a sharp 40 bps higher than CSO’s 4.6 percent.

“This demands an urgent cut in oil prices through tax rationalization otherwise consumers’ non-discretionary spending will continue to get distorted and crowd out discretionary expenses as has been the case in December,” Ghosh noted.

She further said that this trend imparts “an upward bias in inflation.”

Expectations from Budget

Ghosh felt the Budget must make announcements to continue incentivising digital transactions, noting that data shows “even the elderly have been using the digital platform more frequently, during and even long after the lockdown has ended and ideally this should be preserved.”

She also felt the Budget must incentivise the jump in household financial savings, stating: “This could be done by incentivising the investments in public provident fund (PPF), Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme and through new instruments such as infrastructure bonds.”

Liquidity position & RBI management

The Reserve Bank of India’s regulatory changes is “keeping liquidity in sufficient surplus this year,” Ghosh said. Current outstanding level at Rs 5.0 lakh crore as on January 20, 2021.

She however noted that record US Dollar inflows to India is “complicating” the RBI’s liquidity management.

“The net excess supply of Dollar is thus now at a staggering $20.5 billion when we look at interbank and merchant segment,” the report noted.

It added that the RBI has “turned into a purchaser of forward contracts, despite no build-up of excess demand in the forward market, as it is giving financial stability a priority.”

The report further reasoned the RBI “has no recourse but to build their own forex reserve buffer anticipating a rise in the future import demand” similar to what happened in 2009. And that this must have been done “to mitigate global spillovers, and meet rising demand of foreign exchange on account of the widening trade deficit and capital outflows in the subsequent period.”

“Ideally, we believe the RBI should use market stabilisation scheme (MSS) to manage liquidity instead of going for the voluntary retention route (VRR) as liquidity is lying with insurance companies and mutual funds,” it said.

On the liquidity front, the report recommends Rs 20,000 crore worth of open market operations (OMOs) be conducted once a month to remove durable liquidity from the market with preference through state development loan (SDL) OMOs and Operation Twists."

The RBI said this while announcing the 2020 list of D-SIBs.

The RBI had come with the list of D-SIBs first in 2015 including SBI and ICICI Bank. HDFC Bank’s name was included later in September, 2017. 'Too-big-to-fail' lenders are banks whose failure could impact the financial system as a whole because of their size and interconnectedness. This list is published every year.

Such lenders will have to comply with additional capital requirements. The additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) requirement for D-SIBs was phased-in from April 1, 2016 and became fully effective from April 1, 2019.

As per this, the additional common equity Tier 1 requirement as a percentage of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) for SBI is 0.6 per cent and that of other two lenders is 0.2 per cent, according to RBI.

The RBI had issued the framework for dealing with D-SIBs on July 22, 2014. The D-SIB framework requires the Reserve Bank to disclose the names of banks designated as D-SIBs starting from 2015 and place these banks in appropriate buckets depending upon their Systemic Importance Scores (SISs).

Based on the bucket in which a D-SIB is placed, an additional common equity requirement has to be applied to it.

“In case a foreign bank having branch presence in India is a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB), it has to maintain additional CET1 capital surcharge in India as applicable to it as a G-SIB, proportionate to its Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) in India, i.e., additional CET1 buffer prescribed by the home regulator (amount) multiplied by India RWA as per consolidated global Group books divided by total consolidated global Group RWA,” the RBI said.

Based on the methodology provided in the D-SIB framework and data collected from banks as on March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, the Reserve Bank had announced State Bank of India and ICICI Bank Ltd. as D-SIBs on August 31, 2015 and August 25, 2016, respectively.

Based on data collected from banks as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, the Reserve Bank had announced State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd. as D-SIBs on September 04, 2017 and March 14, 2019, respectively.

Current update is based on the data collected from banks as of March 31, 2020."

State Bank of India is offering trade finance solutions and services to Israeli corporates to help them tap business potential arising out of recent Abraham accords leading to normalisation of ties between Israel and Arab states, a bank official said.

International trade activities of late have picked up momentum after the unprecedented market shocks and resultant inactivity due to COVID-19 pandemic induced lockdowns and closures around the world, with optimistic outlook for the near to medium term, B V Ramana, the CEO of SBI Tel Aviv branch told PTI.

""In view of the revival of business activity in the coming months with vaccine approvals being accorded by various governments around the world, we are offering our services/products to the Israeli business community at competitive pricing to meet all their cross border trade finance needs,"" Ramana said.

Looking to tap into the huge business potential arising out of recent Abraham accords leading to normalisation of ties between Israel and Arab states, the Tel Aviv branch has been reaching out to Israeli exporters.

SBI has substantial presence in the Middle East, and the Gulf region in particular, which may act as an enabler and a catalyst for those looking to immediately engage in trade ties with the corporates in the UAE and Bahrain, Ramana said.

Trade finance solutions package for Israeli corporates includes bill discounting products for exports worldwide, including India, extending supplier's credit/ LC bill discounting, bill discounting based on reimbursement authorisation from LC issuing bank and receivables financing under open account trade.

Other trade related products and services include LC advising, LC confirmation, LC bill collection and bank guarantees.

We have also recommended many of our members to open banking activity with the SBI"", Raviv Byron, the President of Israel-India Chamber of Commerce, told PTI.

""As far as activity of Israeli companies wishing to work in the UAE and other Gulf States is concerned, SBI have a big advantage by having a working presence in both Israel and the Gulf states with registered corporate banking in both"", he pointed out.

There is a lot of buzz around the economic potential arising out of the Abraham accords that led to the normalisation of ties between Israel and Arab countries and several delegational visits have already happened between these countries defying COVID-19 pandemic related challenges.

""Having an SBI branch in Israel is a major driver to promoting Israel-India trade relations. More than that, this is a bridge to the Israeli businesses not just to India, but to SBI’s presence world wide"", Anat Bernstein-Reich, Chairperson of Israel-India Chamber of Commerce and Vice President of the Israel-Asia Chamber of Commerce told PTI.

In the first case against Transstroy, the central investigating agency has registered an FIR against M/s Transstroy (India) Ltd, its CMD Cherukuri Shridhar Sridhar, Additional Directors Rayapati Sambasiva Rao and Akkineni Satish, some unknown public servants and others.

People familiar with the development said the amount involved in the Transstroy fraud - Rs 7,926 crore - is even higher than what fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi owes to banks in India, Hindustan Times reported.

The 49-year-old is currently facing extradition proceedings and is lodged in a UK jail. He owes some Rs 7,700 crore to Indian banks.

Transstroy deals in construction of highways, bridges, irrigation projects, and metro related work. The firm is also in the business of oil and gas, which is currently under liquidation process as per the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) September 2019 order.

CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said Transstroy had availed credit facilities on multiple banking arrangements from a Canara Bank-led consortium of banks.

Four have done so in the past one week or so. These include Asian Development Bank, State Bank of India, Fitch, and India Ratings. (See chart)

Before that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had also upgraded its GDP forecast to a contraction of 7.5 per cent from 9.5 per cent seen before the July-September GDP print.

Earlier this week, SBI had slashed its contraction forecast to 7.4 per cent from 10.9 per cent. It also forecast a GDP growth of 0.1 per cent for the October-December quarter.

Even our business activity index which is based on high frequency indicators shows improving momentum after a modest decline in the week of Diwali,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Chief Economic Adviser at SBI.

Ghosh said even as growth outlook had improved, the decline in government expenditure has been quite significant to Rs 3.62 lakh crore in Q2FY21 from Rs 4.86 lakh crore in Q1FY21. The revenue and capital expenditure both declined in Q2 compared to Q1, with larger decline witnessed in revenue expenditure, he said.

Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

A day later ICRA Ltd also improved its growth projections for India, to a 7.8 per cent contraction from 11 per cent seen earlier. It projects a small contraction for October-December at 1 per cent, and a positive growth of 1.3 per cent in January-March.

“Subsequently, improving economic fundamentals, a bright outlook for the rabi season, and the visibility of vaccine availability are expected to strengthen demand,” said Aditi Nayar, Principal Economist with ICRA Ltd.

“The recovery under way in the Indian economy in Q3FY21 is fragile, and appears prone to risks related to rising costs, as well as a re-appearance of supply-side disruptions in some states,” Nayar, however, warned.

Nayar said the spending seen during the festive season was driven by pent-up demand, and consumption is yet to fully stabilise in various sectors. While many indicators have displayed growth in the ongoing quarter relative to a weak performance in the same period in FY20, volumes still remain below FY19 levels in a number of sectors, highlighting that a full recovery remains somewhat distant, she said."
"December 08, 2020 09:19 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sc-hearing-on-loan-moratorium-blanket-interest-waiver-on-all-loans-to-be-rs-6-lakh-crore-centre-to-sc-6205721.html,"Supreme Court of India (SC).

The Centre informed the Supreme Court on Tuesday that if it were to consider waiving interest on all the loans and advances to all categories of borrowers for the six-month moratorium period announced by RBI in view of COVID-19 pandemic, then the amount foregone would be more than Rs 6 lakh crore. If the banks were to bear this burden, then it would necessarily wipe out a substantial and a major part of their net worth, rendering most of the lenders unviable and raising a very serious question mark over their very survival, it said.

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R S Reddy and M R Shah was informed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, that this was one of the main reasons why waiver of interest was not even contemplated and only payment of instalments was deferred. The top court is hearing a batch of pleas of various bodies including from real estate and power seeking sector wise relief in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

SC On Loan Moratorium Highlights: Hearing of petitions seeking interest waiver to resume on Dec 9

Reading from the written submission filed in the top court, Mehta said that if the interest is waived on all the loans and advances for the moratorium period, with regard to all classes and categories of borrowers, the amount to be foregone would be more than Rs 6 lakh crore. It is submitted that if the Government were to consider waiving interest on all the loans and advances to all classes and categories of borrowers corresponding to the six-month period for which the moratorium (deferment of payment of instalment) was made available under the relevant RBI circulars, the estimated amount is more than Rs 6 lakh crore, he said.

Giving an illustration, he said that in case of State Bank of India alone (which is the largest bank in the country), waiver of six months' interest would completely wipe out over half of the bank's net worth which has accumulated over nearly 65 years of its existence. Continued payment of interest (including interest on interest) to depositors is not only one of the most essential banking activities but is a huge responsibility that can never be compromised as most of the depositors are bound to be small depositors, pensioners etc. surviving on the interest from their deposits, he said in his written submissions. It is submitted that if the Government were to consider waiving interest on all the loans and advances to all classes and categories of borrowers corresponding to the six-month period for which the moratorium (deferment of payment of instalment) was made available under the relevant RBI circulars, the estimated amount is more than Rs 6 lakh crore, he said.

Referring to the affidavit filed by Indian Banks Association on September 25, he said that State Bank of India has stated that interest amount from borrowers during six months moratorium works out to be Rs 88,078 crore (approximately) whereas the interest payable to the depositors during the said period works out to be Rs 75,157 crore (approximately). Mehta said that in the Indian banking system for every loan account there are about 8.5 deposit accounts and highlighted the various financial reliefs already granted by the Central government.

He said that going any further may be detrimental to the overall economic scenario, the economy of the nation or the banking sector may not be able to take the financial constraints resulting therefrom. Mehta also pointed out the sector-specific relief measures taken by the Centre for the small and mid-sized business/MSMEs including from sectors such as restaurants and hotels.

He said the Centre has promulgated emergency credit-linked guarantee scheme (ECLGS) of Rs 3 lakh crore providing additional credit at lower rate of interest, with 100 per cent government guarantee and no fresh collateral. The scheme has been extended with higher financial limits to twenty seven COVID-19 impacted sectors including restaurant and hotel sectors, he added.

He said that though it may not be possible to give the exact percentage of the borrowers who have not availed of the moratorium and have deposited instalments in time; approximately such class would be more than 50 per cent. Mehta said that granting relief to distressed small borrowers, the Centre decided that the relief on waiver of compound interest during the six-month moratorium period shall be limited to the most vulnerable category of borrowers who availed loan up to Rs 2 crore.

He said that RBI in its circular dated August 6 classified big borrowers (having the loan account of Rs 1500 crores and above0 and rest as not big borrowers. Mehta added that the customising the reliefs to individual borrowers can never be done either by the Ministry of Finance or by the RBI as it involves crores of borrowers and therefore, it can be done only by respective lenders.

He said that so far as big borrowers are concerned, the RBI appointed an expert committee under the Chairmanship of K V Kamath which segregated various sector borrowers into 26 categories and gave parameters within which banks were directed to restructure the accounts. He added that various steps are taken by different ministers under the Disaster Management Act, as against the wrong notion of petitions that functions of all ministers are to be discharged by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

In other words, so far as the economic impact of the present disaster is concerned, it is essentially the function of the Ministry of Finance and RBI to take measures under Section 36 of the Act and the question of NDMA stepping in would not arise, his written submission said. The day long hearing conducted through video conferencing would continue tomorrow."

State Bank of India (SBI) on December 3 said that it was taking step to restoring its mobile banking application, YONO, after customers complained on Twitter that they were unable to log in.

Though the bank asked the customers to use OnlineSBI and YONO Lite, however, customers seemed to be facing issue there too.

After the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) temporarily stopped launch of all new digital products of HDFC Bank, its new CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan on December 3 said the bank will comply with the RBI regulations and will wait for the regulator’s clearance before launching new products.

“We had two outages, one in November 2018 and second in December 2019. We have taken help of external expertise, understood what needs to be done further and have substantially implemented the inputs to strengthen our IT infrastructure and systems,” Jagdishan said in a letter to customers.

“Unexpectedly another incident happened on November 21,2020, and the primary reason for the same is the power outage in our primary data centre. We are working on war footing to strengthen this area also now,” Jagdishan said.

Jagdishan assured customers that there is no reason to worry. “You can continue to transact with the bank without any concern,” he said.

Jagdishan apologised for the digital outage to customers. “We realize that as our valued customer, you expect us to maintain a very high standard of service quality and experience. And sometimes, we have not been able to live up to your expectations. For that, please accept our sincere apologies,” the CEO said in the letter.

The RBI asked HDFC Bank to temporarily halt sourcing new credit cards and stop the launch of its digital business-generating activities planned under Digital 2.0 and other proposed business generating IT applications.

The RBI issued the order dated December 2, 2020, to HDFC Bank.

The central bank on November 23 had sought an explanation from HDFC Bank after its digital services faced disruptions on the evening of November 21 till November 22 morning - for over 12 hours.

The order also states that HDFC Bank’s board must examine the lapses and fix accountability.

“The above measures shall be considered for lifting (the restrictions) upon satisfactory compliance with the major critical observations as identified by the RBI,” it added.

New launches after RBI’s clearance

Jagdishan said the bank will now launch its digital initiatives after getting the RBI’s approvals.

“Some of our strategic digital initiatives to improve the front-end digital experience, improve digital origination, straight through processing, next generation of mobile and internet banking, API-based banking on the edge etc would now be readied and launched post the approval and clearance from the regulator,” the CEO said in the letter.

Further, the bank will work with experts and the regulator to fortify the identified areas for improvement. “Internally, we are looking at this as an opportunity to further improve ourselves and emerge stronger,” Jagdishan said.

Banks are under immense pressure because of the competition to come up with new digital banking products, often without proper testing and leading to such failures, said senior bankers. “There is intense competition from industry and new players such as payments banks to keep introducing new products. In their anxiety to remain at the top, banks often come with digital banking products that are not fully tested. Banks need to be careful to make sure they have enough technology capabilities to back such products,” said Naresh Malhotra, a senior banking consultant.

To be fair, technical glitches aren’t limited to HDFC Bank alone. Other banks too have been facing problems on the technical side, with the latest instance reported on State Bank of India’s (SBI's) mobile banking application, YONO, in the last two days with customers complaining on Twitter that they are unable to login to the application following an error. This issue has not been resolved yet.

In October, some of the customers of another leading private lender, ICICI Bank too took to social media complaining of issues with the bank’s online payment systems and mobile app."

French giant Amundi has warned the State Bank of India (SBI) that it would sell its SBI green bonds if the bank grants Rs 5,000 crore loan to Adani's Carmichael coal mine in Australia. The project has evoked sharp criticism from environmental groups and locals, who have claimed that the mine would produce 200 million tonnes of carbon dioxide during its 60-year life.

The French asset management company, which holds the bond in its Amundi Planet Emerging Green One fund, said that it has learnt that SBI was considering financing the Carmichael thermal coal mine in Australia.

Under pressure from investors, a string of banks and insurers have already cut ties to the project, with the most recent being Lloyd's insurer Apollo, Reuters reported.

Amundi's Jean Jacques Barberis, director of the institutional and corporate clients division & ESG, said the asset manager had contacted the bank to voice its concern and followed up with a letter to the management on November 26.

The Amundi fund -- the largest aimed at green bonds in the emerging markets -- looks to invest in bonds that help fund environmentally friendly projects, but also looks at the issuer to make sure its other activities are ""coherent"".

""We consider SBI should not finance this project. It's their decision, ultimately, but we've been extremely clear on the fact that, if they decide to do it, we would immediately disinvest,"" Barberis said, as per the Reuters report.

Financing the mine would be in ""total contradiction"" to the SBI activities financed through its green bond, he added. ""We have engaged SBI, asking them not to participate (in the loan)… and now we are waiting for their answers.""

SBI was not immediately available to comment when contacted by Reuters.

Carmichael has drawn strong opposition from climate campaigners over the potential carbon emissions that would be produced by the mine, at a time when many countries are exiting coal to help fight global warming.

Amundi is Europe's largest asset manager and ranks in the top 10 globally. It manages assets worth 1,650 billion euros."

State Bank of India expects the country's central bank to hold interest rates as inflation remains elevated, the chairman of India's largest lender Dinesh Kumar Khara said.

""The stance will continue to remain accommodative but they may not be in a position to cut interest rate in immediate future,"" Khara told a summit organised by the Hindustan Times.

Bank Strike News Highlights: Banking services partially impacted at some PSBs

Khara's comment comes only days before the monetary policy committee of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country's central bank, is due to meet between Dec. 2 and Dec. 4.

India's retail inflation remained above 7% in October for a second straight month, with vegetable prices at elevated levels. At current levels, inflation is well above the RBI's medium term target of 4%.

Inflation remained high due to supply chain constraints which can be eased once India begins to unlock further, after when the RBI may be in a position to cut rates, Khara said.

Since March, the RBI has cut its repo rate by 115 basis points to cushion the shock from the coronavirus crisis."

Kapil Wadhawan, promoter of crisis-ridden mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL), has moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking participation in the committee of creditors' (CoC) meeting to be part of the discussions for finding a bidder.

Wadhawan has filed a petition in the Mumbai NCLT against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-appointed administrator in the matter.

Wadhawan has also requested access to data on DHFL's assets.

So far, there is no clarity on the bidding process for the troubled lender which was caught in a series of alleged financial irregularities.

Lenders to DHFL are likely to call for another round of bids, seeking higher value for its assets.

The bidders to DHFL include Adani Group, Piramal Enterprises, US-based Oaktree, and Hong Kong-based SC Lowy.

SC Lowy had submitted 10-70 percent higher price for either a stake in the company or buying out some of its assets.

Oaktree Capital has raised its bid price for the entire portfolio to Rs 33,000 crore from Rs 27,800 crore earlier.

There is a possibility that lenders may seek fresh bids seeking higher value.

Earlier, in a letter to administrator on November 11, Wadhawan had requested the RBI-appointed administrator to allow him to participate in the next meeting of the CoC so that he could “put forth some of these thoughts to the CoC on the video conference to constructively aid in the resolution process of DHFL”.

“I’m presently handicapped as I have no access to the records of the company to ascertain the present position, and I’m constrained to rely on the newspaper reports as well as my knowledge and experience of having run the business for more than 15 years,” Wadhawan said.

If given access to the records, he can make a proposal setting out the necessary upfront and deferred payment components, which will provide maximum value realization for all stakeholders, Wadhawan said.

DHFL is the first financial services company which has been sent to the NCLT under the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC).

In his letter, Wadhawan repeated his offer to pay up the entire principal amount to all creditors without any haircut, besides letting all creditors convert part of their debt to equity.

“Even today, I am willing to stand by the principle of 100 percent repayment of principal amounts to all the creditors without any hair cut as I do believe, from DHFL’s business, that such recovery is possible,” Wadhawan said in the letter.

DHFL is facing claims of Rs 87,031 crore from financial creditors.

Its large lenders include State Bank of India (including SBI Singapore) with Rs 10,083 crore exposure, Bank of India Rs 4,125 crore, Canara Bank Rs 2,681 crore, NHB Rs 2,434 crore, Union Bank of India Rs 2,378 crore, Syndicate Bank Rs 2,229 crore, and Bank of Baroda Rs 2,075 crore, Indian Bank Rs 1,552 crore, Central Bank Rs 1,389 crore, IDBI Bank Rs 999 crore, and HDFC Bank Rs 361 crore.

DHFL posted a net loss of Rs 2,122.65 crore in the quarter ended September, 2020, as compared with a net loss of Rs 6,640.62 crore in the corresponding quarter in the previous year.

It had posted a profit of Rs 70 crore in the first quarter.

Total assets of the company stand at Rs 83,638 crore as of September-end, compared with Rs 85,926.95 crore in the March quarter. Total liabilities stood at Rs 91,250.13 crore in the September quarter as against Rs 91,326.19 crore in the preceding quarter, the company informed exchanges on November 26.

In the results note, auditors said the company’s ability to continue as a going concern depends upon the outcome of the ongoing corporate insolvency resolution process."
"November 27, 2020 01:49 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/paytm-sbi-credit-card-review-should-you-apply-6159301.html,"Recently, Paytm partnered with SBI Card to roll out two credit cards: Paytm SBI card Select and Paytm SBI card. The cards are focused on catering to digitally-savvy customers who shop online majorly, especially in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. You can apply for the card through the Paytm app. The annual fees is Rs 1499 for Paytm SBI card Select and Rs 499 for Paytm SBI card. Are these cards worthwhile and should you apply for them?

What’s the offer

Once you apply for these cards using the Paytm app, SBI will decide your credit limit, “based on the transaction history on Paytm,” says Ashwini Kumar Tewari, MD & CEO, SBI Card. Both are physical cards.

For Paytm SBI Card Select, annual fee is waived if you spend at least Rs 2 lakh a year. There is no fee waiver for Paytm SBI Card holders.

Both cards offer cashbacks if you book movie and travel tickets on the Paytm app or shop at Paytm Mall (the online store). A small cashback is also on offer if you shop from other websites or physical stores. “You can also block or unblock the card through a single click on both the Paytm app as well as the SBI Card app,” says a spokesperson from Paytm.

What works

If you use the Paytm app exclusively for booking travel or movie tickets, shopping on Paytm Mall and paying utility bills, then these credit cards are designed for you. It offers up to 5 percent cashback for transactions done on the Paytm app using the card.

The card offers safety features. You can switch off the contactless payments feature on your cards. And they also offer a cyber fraud insurance cover; Rs 2 lakh on Paytm SBI Card Select and Rs 1 lakh cover on Paytm SBI Card.

Also read: Overspent on your credit card this Diwali? Here’s how you can reduce your debt

What doesn’t work

There is no major benefit for transacting using these credit cards outside of the Paytm app or mall. “When you compare it with HDFC Bank’s Millennia credit card, you will know that 5 percent cashback is extended to shopping on popular e-commerce websites like Amazon and Flipkart,” says Tushar Jain, a personal finance blogger at www.jaintushar.com. The HDFC Bank’s Millennia card doesn’t bind customers to one platform for taking the maximum cashback benefit.

When we compare Paytm SBI Card Select and Paytm SBI Card with other co-branded cards such as Flipkart Axis Bank card and Amazon Pay ICICI Bank card the cashback offer seems to be of a similar range. You get a 5 percent and 3 percent cashback on Paytm SBI Card Select and Paytm SBI Card, respectively, upon booking movie and travel tickets on Paytm app as well as on shopping from Paytm Mall. For other spends on Paytm app using these cards, you will receive a 2 per cent cashback while 1 per cent cashback is offered on spends elsewhere.

“But, co-branded cards of Flipkart and Amazon will continue to see a better demand as people tend to spend more on these popular e-commerce websites for shopping instead of Paytm,” says a spokesperson from www.creditcardz.in.

“While people might be shopping more on these e-commerce platforms, there are users spending on the Paytm platform as well. Starting from paying education fees, monthly utility bills, booking travel tickets, paying rent, insurance premium, etc. as well as the card can be used offline in merchant stores and earn flat 2 per cent cashback. So, the avenues where our card can be used are vast,” says a spokesperson from Paytm. These cards will make sense for you only if you are using the Paytm app exclusively for regular transactions.

The annual fees charged on both variants of Paytm SBI Card are higher with fewer benefits <see table>. Also, if you wish to get the annual fees waived off, you’ve got to spend more using Paytm SBI Card. “The annual fee waiver after Rs two lakh spending is too bigger amount for a card in this segment,” says Jain. HDFC Bank Millennia Credit Card offers the annual fee waiver for spends of at least Rs 30,000 and above within the first 90 days of issuing the card, or after at least Rs 1 lakh is spent through the year.

How does a customer get cashback?

The way Paytm SBI Cards give cashbacks is similar to other co-branded card of Amazon Pay ICICI Bank. Here, both variants of Paytm SBI Card give cashback in the form of Paytm gift vouchers. These gift vouchers can be used to make any payment on the Paytm app. Similarly, for Amazon Pay ICICI Bank card, the Amazon Pay wallet of customers gets credited with a cashback amount. A customer can redeem the amount from Amazon Pay wallet on next purchase (she can buy anything with this money) or while paying utility bills via Amazon.

For customers of Flipkart Axis Bank card, the credit card bill gets reduced with a cashback amount in a statement.

Moneycontrol’s take

Paytm SBI cards binds you to the Paytm app. They limit your choices because these cards want you to not just spend more through the Paytm system but also consume the benefits from them. Paytm SBI Card or Paytm SBI Card Select makes sense for you only if you use the Paytm app exclusively for day-to-day shopping, or pay utility bills or make bookings for travel and so on. If you don’t, skip these cards. They pale in comparison with what competitors offer."

The State Bank of India (SBI), the country's largest lender, offers safe deposit or bank lockers facility. As it is considered safe, many customers prefer to keep their valuable belongings such as gold, cash and important documents, among others, in these lockers.

Lockers are available in various sizes -- small, medium, large and extra large -- depending on usage. The charges may vary depending on the locker size and the bank's branch.

SBI had raised rental charges for its safe deposit lockers across India effective from March 31. In semi-urban and rural areas, SBI's branches offer cheaper locker services.

The bank is allowed to open the locker if it is not opened for at least for one year. However, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the bank is required to send a notice to the customer advising them to either operate the locker or surrender it.

The State Bank of India (SBI)-led consortium of banks told the Supreme Court on October 26 that around Rs 3,600 crore had been recovered from fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya so far.

Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing the SBI-led banks consortium, also informed the apex court that Rs 11,000 crore were still needed to be recovered from Mallya, The Times of India reported.

The top court dismissed a petition filed by Mallya's United Breweries Holdings Limited (UBHL) challenging a Karnataka High Court order upholding the closing of the company for recovery of dues payable by Kingfisher Airlines Ltd, news reports suggest.

Rohatgi argued that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) should not have attached the company’s properties as these were encumbered assets and thus, the banks had the first claim over the assets.

Mallya is wanted back in India under charges of financial fraud. He defaulted on repayment of loans taken by the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines from several Indian banks. In January 2019, a special Prevention of Money-Laundering Act (PMLA) court had declared him a 'fugitive economic offender'.

He has been based in the United Kingdom since March 2016 and is currently on bail for an extradition warrant executed three years ago by the Scotland Yard.

Earlier, the Centre informed the Supreme Court that the extradition order to bring the fugitive liquor baron back to India had not been come into effect, and it was unaware of any ""secret"" proceedings that were delaying the process.

A bench comprising Justices UU Lalit and Ashok Bhushan asked Mallya’s lawyer to inform the court what kind of ""secret"" proceedings were going on to delay his extradition.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) later said it was in constant touch with the UK court and that Mallya’s extradition had been halted due to an unresolved legal matter."

SBI cards reported that its gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose to 1.4 percent in the April-June quarter to 4.3 percent in Q2. That is a huge spike in bad loans.

That’s not the real shocker. The company has not classified any account which were not declared NPA as of August 31, 2020, as NPAs, following a Supreme Court (SC) interim stay. On September 3, the SC had said: “Accounts not declared NPAs till August 31 are not to be declared NPAs till further orders.""

If that portion is accounted for, the company's gross NPA would have risen to 7.46 percent. That means, in reality, the gross NPAs of SBI Cards has skyrocketed to 7.5 percent from 1.4 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis.

Credit cost increases

The gross credit costs of the firm for the first half of the financial year 2021 have spiked to 11.3 percent from 6.9 percent in the comparable period in the previous fiscal year.

Credit cost refers to the cost of borrowing of a company. The credit cost in the second quarter is at 14.6 percent, compared with 5.9 percent in the year-ago quarter.

About 57 percent of the company’s borrowings have come from bank lines, while 28 percent through debentures and 15 percent through Commercial Papers.

‘Worse than expected’

Bankers and analysts said that the sharp jump in NPAs are on account a combination of factors-- the COVID-impact and the SC’s interim order. “An increase was expected but this is much worse than one thought,” said an analyst.

Unsecured loans are, typically, highly vulnerable in an economic downturn. These loans could turn into major pain points to lending institutions if the COVID impact persists, said a senior credit rating agency officials on condition of anonymity.

“All depends on how long the pandemic impact stays,” said the official.

COVID-19 has led to major income losses as companies resorted to layoffs or salary cuts. Even self-employed individuals witnessed a significant dip in their cash flows because of the pandemic. The SC’s interim order has helped to partly hide the exact impact on the books.

About 78 percent SBI Cards borrowers are salaried while 22 percent is self-employed. It is learned that the company has seen much of its NPAs coming from the self-employed segment as COVID affected cash flows, causing defaults.

The economic growth is projected to contract sharply in this fiscal year on account of COVID-19. The RBI expects the GDP to contract 9.5 percent while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a10.3 percent fall in 2020.

Most businesses have suffered hard as customers have postponed their discretionary spending due to the COVID situation.

Q2 net profit falls

In Q2 FY21, SBI cards posted a 46 percent fall in net profit to Rs 206 crore over Q2 FY20. Total income increased by Rs 137 crore, or 5.7 percent to Rs 2,513 crore for Q2 FY21, from Rs 2,376 crore in Q2 FY20. The management made a provision of Rs 268 crore in Q2 of FY21. Provision refers to money set aside to cover likely losses.

Total gross advances (credit card receivables), as of September 30, 2020, stood at Rs 23,978 crore, against Rs 23,038 crore as of September 30, 2019. The company’s net worth, as of September 30, 2020, was Rs 5,949 crore as against Rs 4,388 crore as of September 30, 2019."

State Bank of India (SBI) has announced home loan interest rate concession of up to 25 bps as part of its festive offer.

The lender will offer a 20 bps interest concession for loans above Rs 75 lakh, based on the customer's credit score.

An additional 5 percent will be given if the home loan application is done through the YONO platform. Women who are buying a home will also get an additional 5 percent concession.

""In an extension of its festive offers announced recently, SBI offers a credit score based concessions of up to 20 bps from 10 bps earlier, for a home loan of above Rs 30 lakhs to Rs 2 crores across India,"" the bank said in a statement.

The above-mentioned concession is also applicable on home loans of up to Rs 3 crore in eight metro cities.

This means SBI's lowest interest rate has been cut to 6.9 percent on home loans of up to Rs 30 lakh, and 7 percent for home loans of above Rs 30 lakh.

Economists at State Bank of India (SBI) have recommended a scheme called ""Adopt-a-Family"", where taxpayers are incentivised to support a BPL family amid the pandemic.

""In this way a BPL family which is badly hit due to COVID-19 will get support of Rs 60,000 without any fiscal burden on Government,"" SBI's Economic Research Department said in a note.

Under the voluntary scheme, taxpayers (possibly those with an annual income of Rs 10 lakh and above) can provide a family with financial assistance for a specified amount each month (Rs 5,000 for instance).

India has around 70 lakh taxpayers who have the above mentioned annual income, and even if 10 percent opt for the scheme it can benefit around 7 lakh families, the economists said.

""To boost the scheme, Government can ideally incentivise say Rs 50,000 tax deduction over and above 80C limits to the taxpayer and nudge agents to adopt a poor family,"" the report said.

The 7 lakh families (28 lakh individuals) would receive a combined monetary benefit of Rs 3,500 crore.

The transactions can be monitored by bank accounts through payments enabled by Aadhaar.

The economists estimate that the government will have to forgo income tax worth Rs 1,050 crore, but the proposal would result in a consumption boom of Rs, 11,666 crore.

The scheme is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Jan Bhagidari (people’s participation) vision, the report said."

In an interview with PTI, DLF's group chief financial officer (CFO) Vivek Anand said the debt has been raised at a very attractive interest rate of 7.35 percent, enabling the company to reduce interest cost.

DLF Cyber City Developers Ltd (DCCDL), the joint venture between DLF and Singapore sovereign fund GIC, has 33 million sq ft of office and retail properties generating an annual rental income of Rs 3,500 crore. DLF holds 66.66 percent stake in DCCDL while GIC has the rest. ""DCCDL has secured funding of Rs 2,400 crore from India's largest public sector bank SBI. It sets a benchmark for lease rental discounting (LRD) in the country,"" Anand told PTI.

The fund has been raised through the LRD route against a rental portfolio of 2.4 million sq ft area in Cyber City, Gurugram. ""It is one of the biggest disbursements by any public sector bank during the COVID-19 pandemic. This also clearly demonstrates our strong tenant profile and ability to generate cash for a long-term period,"" said Anand, who joined the company last year.

Asked about utilisation of funds, Anand who is a chartered accountant by profession with 25 years of experience across businesses, said DCCDL has refinanced its existing debt worth Rs 1,950 crore while Rs 450 crore will be used for future expansion. At present, DCCDL has a debt of around Rs 19,500 crore.

""In the short to medium term, the debt of DCCDL will remain at Rs 20,000 crore level because of our plan to expand portfolio,"" Anand said. He noted that the company has chalked out a plan to develop 18 million sq ft of commercial assets, of which 4 million sq ft is already under construction in Chennai and Gurugram.

Talking about the operational performance of the rental business during this pandemic, Anand said the DCCDL's rental collections and occupancy level were robust at over 95 percent during the first half of this fiscal and the outlook remains positive. He said the company has not reduced rental of leased office space, but rents have been deferred in few cases.

Referring to retail real estate segment, Anand said the shopping malls business has been impacted due to the outbreak COVID-19 and subsequent lockdown during April-May. He said footfalls in its malls, which were allowed to open from June, have reached 50-60 percent of the pre-COVID-19 level.

With multiplexes opening and ease of curb in food and beverages (F&B) segment, he hoped that footfall would gradually increase. However, Anand highlighted some positive trends in retail space like conversion rates being higher with only serious buyers visiting shopping malls and international brands doing better due to restrictions in overseas travel.

The group CFO said the DCCDL is going ahead with its expansion of office portfolio, and the construction work is being undertaken at ongoing projects in Chennai and Gurugram. Anand said the company's rental income will rise further as rent from its Cyber Park project has started accruing from this month. This 2.5 million sq ft project will help it earn Rs 350 crore annually.

DLF had formed a joint venture with GIC in December 2017 after its promoters sold their entire 40 percent stake in the DCCDL for nearly Rs 12,000 crore. This deal included sale of 33.34 percent stake in DCCDL to GIC for about Rs 9,000 crore and buyback of remaining shares worth about Rs 3,000 crore by the DCCDL."

The idea of creating a ‘bad bank’, a single entity which will house all bad loans in the banking system, is back on the discussion table. Two former central bankers, Raghuram Rajan and Viral Acharya and former State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman, Rajnish Kumar, have strongly supported the idea.

Days after a jointly-authored paper by Rajan and Acharya pitched the bad bank idea, outgoing SBI Chairman too said this is the best time to create a bad bank.

“In my view, this is the best time to create a bad bank,” said Kumar in an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol on Wednesday.

A 'bad bank' is a bank set up to buy the bad loans and other illiquid holdings of another financial institution. Once toxic assets are transferred to this entity, attempts for an early resolution by experts begins while originating banks can focus on their business. Banks can transfer NPAs to a bad bank at a discount. The price discovery can happen later.

Rajan and Acharya too wrote in favour of the bad bank plan.

“The national public sector “bad bank” could serve as a vehicle to aggregate loans, create management teams for distressed firms, and possibly buy and hold distressed assets in a sector like power till demand returns,” the paper said.

Further, private asset management and national asset management “bad banks” should be encouraged in parallel to the online platform for distressed loan sales. Private players could aggregate and recover on loans in sectors where government intervention isn’t necessary, the paper said.

In April-May this year, the idea of bad bank was in active discussions when the Indian Banks Association (IBA) mooted the idea with the government by submitting a formal proposal.

The IBA proposed that bad bank will have an ARC-AMC model and an alternative investment fund (AIF) will be set up to buy the stressed assets from the banking system. But, the idea didn’t find many takers then on account of then.

Time more ideal

But, Kumar said the time is different now since bet value of NPA assets with banks have fallen dramatically. Explaining his logic, Kumar said a bad bank was not created before because the net book value of NPAs was very high.

“Today, the net book value of NPAs is very low—hardly 15 per cent in many cases. The point is if there are people specialising on resolution, and if all NPAs are brought to one place, bank managements can focus on the rest of the business,” Kumar said.

Also, this will speed up resolution, Kumar said. “Right now, if there is a large corporate NPA, one needs to go to 10-15 banks for resolution. Whether you are making a bad bank or not, the resolution process is very slow. It needs to be faster,” the former SBI Chairman said.

Who will fund?

Regardless of the model with which the bad bank is created, the bigger debate has always been who will put in the initial capital required to get the bad bank up and running. In May this year, when the IBA submitted its proposal, it had requested the government to put in an initial capital of Rs 10,000 crore.

Kumar, who was IBA Chairman at that point, said the government which is the majority owner in the Indian banking industry, needs to invest in the bad bank.

“PSBs own 60 percent of the banking system. We can’t transfer (bad loans) to any other entity other than a government-owned company. This is the logic (of saying government has to fund the project),” said Kumar.

Kumar’s successor at SBI Dinesh Kumar Khara, didn’t give a specific answer at a press conference on Wednesday to a question on whether he supports the idea of a bad bank. Khara said various options are being looked at by lenders, bad bank being one of them.

“The central concept behind all these options is aggregation of stressed loans…we have to see which is the best way,” said Khara.

Not a new idea

The idea of a bad bank is not new. In 2018, the government had announced a plan for PSBs called 'Project Sashakt', which had a five-point plan for bad loan resolution in public sector banks.

The government then spoke of a model, with the guiding principles of an Asset Management Company (AMC) resolution approach, under which an independent AMC would be set up to focus on asset turnaround, job creation and protection. The functions of this new company will be aligned with Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) process and IBC laws, the government had said.

The government did not call it a bad bank then and made it clear that it won't get involved in the bad asset resolution process and the process will be led by banks.

With this, an alternative investment fund (AIF)-based resolution approach for loans above Rs 500 crore was also discussed under which an AIF would raise funds from institutional investors. Banks, too, will have an option to participate, if they wish to participate on the upside. The idea could not be executed for various reasons.

The talk about 'bad bank' bears a resemblance to 'Project Sashakt', albeit in a different avatar. The idea is good and more workable now since banks have already made 70-80 percent provisions on the NPAs after the mega clean-up exercise. They can remove the remaining by transferring the assets to a different entity, experts argue."

A pandemic, a private bank bailout and a deep economic slowdown – all happened during his term. Kumar played a key role in bailing out Yes Bank. During his tenure, SBI has substantially cut down the chunk of toxic assets and successfully completed the amalgamation process of its associates.

In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, Kumar opened up about the challenges he faced.

Edited excerpts:

How tough was your three years as SBI Chairman?Kumar: There were many challenges in the last three years. When I took charge, the merger process (with associates) was on, and then AQR (asset quality review) happened. There was significant stress on the books. And, of course, IBC (insolvency and bankruptcy code) also happened during that period. Having said that, I feel one can get tested only when there are challenges. If you are only doing your routine job, there is no excitement. That’s how I have managed this time. Challenging, but exciting.

What were the toughest parts?Kumar: The first and biggest was to put the balance sheet in order. There was some hesitance in the bank about declaring a loss as part of cleaning up the book. This is SBI, how can we declare a loss, this will be bad, they asked. I had to convince them it is not like that. But, it doesn’t mean that the entire organisation was fixated on one problem — NPAs (non-performing assets).

How did the NPA battle go?Kumar: The challenge was to get a handle on the NPA resolution by strengthening the stressed assets resolution. So, all NPAs that were spread across were brought into one group and very competent people were posted in that group to handle NPAs. This has shown results. At the start itself, that was the biggest challenge.

What are the biggest pain points in NPA management at this juncture?Kumar: It has always been corporate NPAs. Corporate NPAs are what causes the biggest problem. Now, of course, net corporate NPAs are just Rs 10,500 crore, which is virtually nothing. What I’m saying is that the bank doesn’t get impacted by retail as much as by corporate NPAs. At one point, it constituted 25 percent of the corporate book in NPAs and that was the whole cause of the problem. Now, it has been brought down. But, you have to be very careful. Retail is manageable.

You have an Advance Under Collection Account (UACA) for chronic NPA cases Kumar: AUCA is essentially an accounting entry. The on-balance sheet NPAs, which are already fully provided for and where net asset value is almost close to zero, can be taken off the balance sheet. But it doesn’t mean that that account will not be followed up and there will be no recovery efforts. So, the first thing was to put the balance sheet in order. We ensured that not everybody should be spending time on NPA management and should focus on other functions as well.

Are you disappointed with the progress in the Vijay Mallya case? Kumar: The attempts to recover money from Mallya continue. His properties were attached and pledged to the bank by the Enforcement Directorate. The extradition matter is between the government of India and Vijay Mallya. Whatever security the bank had to enforce and realise money have been done. The bank has been able to recover about 25-30 percent (from the Vijay Mallya-Kingfisher account).

Can you list the three most critical challenges in SBI right now?Kumar: The first, of course, will be COVID-19. The bank needs to be very watchful on this, although the major stress is already addressed. Second is maintaining the competitive edge of the bank in a tight competitive environment and continuing the leadership position. The third is keeping an eye on the earnings profile, and keeping a handle on NPAs. The institution should keep NPAs under strict control. Don’t lose the leadership position.

What is your advice to your successor?Kumar: Well, he (Dinesh Kumar Khara) has been part of the team. My advice to him will be to adhere to the core values of the bank. If somebody adheres to the core values of the bank, there will be no problem in managing State Bank.

You recently spoke about YONO valuation…Kumar: The (valuation) debate was in a different context. When I was having a conversation in one of the webinars, the point was about startup valuations. What I said is when I look at the valuation of other startups, YONO’s valuation should be $40 billion. I said it ‘should be’. The comments that followed showed that I’m not off the mark.

(YONO is an integrated digital banking platform offered by State Bank of India to enable users to access a variety of financial and other services such as flights, trains, buses and taxi bookings, online shopping, or medical bill payments.)

Can you give an update about hiving off YONO to a separate entity?Kumar: It is under serious discussion. First, we need to have an agreement with the technology partner on how to carve it out.

Were you forced to do the Yes Bank rescue?Kumar: The situation developed in such a way that without SBI, it (the rescue) looked difficult. Without SBI, Yes Bank would not have been saved. The implications could have been serious to the stability of the banking system of the country. Only SBI had the balance-sheet size and capability to handle its revival. And in the process, of course, I’m happy that many private-sector banks participated to make a collective effort.

So you were not forced to do it?Kumar: It’s not a question of force. It’s a call State Bank had to take. In the given circumstances, it was very difficult for State Bank to say that we don’t want to do it. But we did it in a manner that didn’t harm our shareholders’ interests. We didn’t agree for a merger. SBI provided the leadership and comfort to other investors and depositors. The role which the bank played was a constructive one. The structure at which SBI is holding, we have about 30 per cent in the bank. It will do well. No doubt about it.

But you called it an ‘investment’ Kumar: The price at which we have invested, we are not going to lose money. They are going to gain from this investment. To that extent, it benefits the shareholders of SBI.

Will SBI consider merging Yes Bank with itself in future?Kumar: Not at all. Merger is not about the balance sheet. Merger is about culture integration, which is impossible between State Bank and Yes Bank.

How satisfied are you with the integration progress of associates and the Bhartiya Mahila Bank with SBI?Kumar: That has been very smooth. Within six months, the process got over. It has been smooth from an employee and customer perspective.

During your term, there was a report that said you were snubbed publicly by the Union finance minister. Your comments.Kumar: ‘SBI Chairman’ is a prestigious position in the industry and its importance can be gauged from the fact that the first chairman was a former finance minister. The dignity of that position needs to be maintained.

Your comment on low pay of PSB employees evoked strong criticism from a former SBI chairman.Kumar: The comment was probably made without understanding the context. My comment was never about the SBI Chairman’s compensation, but about other people.

How bad is the COVID situation?Kumar: One needs to be watchful but the situation is not as bad for the financial system as some people have made it out. I’m saying this as a banker, and from whatever I see on State Bank’s books. The recovery, I mean the full recovery, will happen only when how soon you are able to find a vaccine. Otherwise, the recovery has been fairly okay across sectors.

What is the long-term impact of moratorium and the one-time recast on the asset quality in the system?Kumar: The moratorium is over and as far as one-time restructuring is concerned, there are sufficient safeguards as prescribed by the RBI.

What percentage of SBI’s total restructuring could go for one-time restructuring?Kumar: Our estimate is what many people don’t agree. But, I think not more than Rs 20,000 crore will go for restructuring — retail and corporate put together.

RBI estimates the GNPAs to go to 14.7 per cent next year…Kumar: That is a worst-case scenario. I don’t think we are heading to that situation. In State Bank of India, our NPA figure will not be higher than what it was during the previous year.

Do you think it’s time to rethink about government ownership in PSU banks and in SBI?Kumar: The government has an agenda about social banking, which is the very purpose with which State Bank was created, although today we do everything — corporate banking and commercial banking. We are a listed entity and we have to perform. Other than that, I haven’t seen any pressure from the government.

From the perspective of market valuation, the value will go up if government ownership goes below 50 per cent. But I think SBI will be the last if this happens. The government has to look at PSU banks first.

The PJ Nayak committee had recommended privatisation of PSU banks. But this remains an unfinished agenda.Kumar: It is all about governance, not really about ownership. Not all private sector banks are properly managed. We have seen that in the past. Ultimately, regardless of the ownership, governance structure needs to be strong.

What’s your take on bad bank? Kumar: In my view, this is the best time to create a bad bank (A bad bank is a bank set up to buy the bad loans and other illiquid holdings of another financial institution).

A bad bank was not created years ago because the net book value of NPAs was very high. Today, the net book value of NPAs is very low—hardly 15 per cent in many cases. The point is if there are people specialising on resolution, and if all NPAs are brought to one place, bank managements can focus on the rest of the business.

Resolution can be faster. Right now, if there is a large corporate NPA, one needs to go to 10-15 banks for resolution. Whether you are making a bad bank or not, the resolution process is very slow. It needs to be faster.

Who will fund it?Kumar: The Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) had recommended that the government should fund it. The model suggested was that banks, in the first stage, should transfer NPAs at net book value, and, later on, price discovery should happen through a transparent process, say within six months.

Now, PSBs own 60 percent of the banking system. We can’t transfer to any other entity other than a government-owned company. This is the logic. This is not understood properly and everybody started commenting on it.

Are you happy with the way RBI has functioned as a regulator?Kumar: The RBI has been doing a fantastic job. A regulator is a regulator. As a regulated entity, we have to follow certain discipline and decorum. If you have a view, you can write to the regulator but taking on the regulator isn’t good.

RBI has been pushing for better monetary policy transmission

If you see the governor’s recent speeches, that complaint is no longer there.

Your future goals?Kumar: To keep myself physically and mentally fit.

Will you be looking at other professional assignments?

Kumar: Why not? But whatever I do, that will be befitting the stature of the post I held as SBI chairman. Nobody, including me, should do anything that lowers the stature of that position."

For Rajnish Kumar, who hails from a small town in Uttar Pradesh and joined the State Bank of India (SBI) as a Probationary Officer in 1980, it was a dream come true when the call came naming him as the chairman of India’s largest bank in October 2017.

Three years have passed since then. Rajnish Kumar’s term as chairman of SBI ended on October 6. Kumar took over the baton from Arundhati Bhattacharya at a time when SBI was struggling to control its chronic bad debts and retain its business momentum in a faltering economy.

But his selectors had full faith in Kumar —a seasoned banker and a trusted hand in the bank. He was seen as a person who would keep his head down and work without getting into controversies.

Having served in the bank for 40 years, Kumar is familiar with every aspect of the organisation -- the risks and opportunities, the problem areas and potentials. For the government, which was looking for a no-nonsense candidate, Kumar was the perfect choice and a safe bet.

Where does SBI stand now?

Three years later, Kumar is hanging up his boots, leaving the bank in a much better position -- in terms of bad loan management. SBI’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) have come down from around Rs 1.99 lakh crore in December 2017, to around Rs 1.29 lakh crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal year.

Gross NPA ratio fell from near double-digit levels to less than six per cent. During his term, SBI successfully managed the post-merger integration process with associate banks and the Bhartiya Mahila Bank.

The bank, under Kumar, moved ahead with its digital drive through SBI’s YONO platform and consolidated its troubled corporate accounts.

Kumar’s colleagues remember him as a friendly senior officer who stood with the team in crisis situations. In an interview with Moneycontrol recently, Kumar said he firmly believed in leading from behind.

“As they say, a leader is only as good as his team. I always believe that a good team is essential to make things happen. Fortunately, SBI has no dearth of talent,” Kumar said. But, he didn’t leave tough decisions to others. “Tough decisions are best taken by one person. A group of people can debate and offer suggestions, but ultimately, the leader has to take the final call and own the responsibility,” Kumar said.

Yes Bank bailout the crowning glory

Perhaps, Kumar’s biggest challenge during his term was managing the bailout of Yes Bank in March this year. Yes Bank, ravaged by frauds by the previous management and critical financial position, was in ICU when Kumar got the call to lead the rescue. The bailout team comprised half of the banking industry, and was guided by a time-bound plan framed by the banking regulator in consultation with the government.

“Yes Bank will not be allowed to fail. Some solution will come,” Kumar once said when there was still uncertainty over the bank’s future. He moved swiftly and spearheaded the bailout, which included appointing a former SBI executive Prashant Kumar, as the administrator of the bank.

Rajnish Kumar received praise from all quarters for smoothly conducting the whole process and handing over Yes Bank to a safer management.

Fire and fury from finance minister

During Kumar’s tenure as SBI chief, there has been occasions when he came under heavy criticism from the finance ministry. Once, reports about finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman reportedly snubbing Kumar at an event in Guwahati surfaced.

In that event, the FM called the SBI a “heartless bank"", and even accused the country's largest lender of failing to extend loans to tea-garden workers in Assam, reports said.

Of course, Kumar knew that the SBI chairman’s job is tougher than other PSB chiefs since the lender commands a leadership position in the banking sector. Hence, the SBI chief’s comments and actions will be watched closely by the government.

Kumar’s reply to a salary cut question

Despite the pressures at work, Kumar presented himself as an articulate banker, even cracking jokes at press conferences and seminars. Once in a conference call with analysts, Kumar was asked if his bank would undertake a pay cut for employees.

Pat came his reply: “Road pe aake rehna padega, pehle hi itni kam milti hai (I'll have to live on the road, I already get so less).” Though this was said in jest, no one could miss the undertones to the relatively lower pay of state-owned bankers.

As he leaves…

When Kumar is handing over the baton to his successor, SBI is in a much stabler position financially, compared to 2017 when he assumed charge. However, unseen shocks from COVID-19 continue to threaten the bank. There is a possibility that bad loans could escalate, post the one-time restructuring exercise necessitating significantly higher capital.

The worry is the uncertain environment ahead. No one in the banking system, including the regulator, knows exactly how deep the bad loan problem is. Kumar's successor has his task cut out.

The challenges

The challenges ahead for SBI is mainly on the NPA-front. This is evident from a recent downgrade of SBI’s standalone profile to ba2 to from ba1 by global rating agency, Moody’s.

Moody's has cautioned that the bank's asset quality and profitability will deteriorate going ahead. The resultant weakening in internal capital generation will reverse improvements in the bank's financial metrics achieved over the past two years” Moody’s said.

Of course, SBI may not have any immediate implications on account of the downgrade in its standalone profile. The bank’s overall rating has been affirmed by Moody’s in line with the sovereign rating. However, the downgrade is a strong message to the lender that all is not well for the bank.

For the new chief, managing asset quality will be the primary challenge.

SBI needs to keep a close watch on NPA movement going ahead as the proposed one-time restructuring could hide stress on its books for a prolonged period.

The challenges could arise from restructured loans if the economic recovery doesn’t happen at the desired pace. SBI expects around Rs 20,000 crore loans to go into restructuring. But, analysts expect that could be an overly optimistic assessment and the actual figure could be much more."

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Attra, a former Partner at EY India and ICICI Securities senior executive joined the bank on October 1, the bank informed the stock exchanges.

Moneycontrol was the first to report the key move a month back on August 31. This is a rare lateral hire from the private sector by SBI for a C-suite position. In the past, it has relied on its experienced talent pool of top management.

State Bank of India (SBI) and Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) have partnered to cater to the needs of small retailers of HUL by providing them digital payment and financing solutions.

Under the partnership, SBI will digitally empower HUL retailers and distributors through UPI based payment solutions and PoS (point-of-sale) terminals.

The bank will also offer instant paperless overdraft facility of up to Rs 50,000 to retailers for their billings with distributors as well as financing facility to HUL’s distributors. The company will start the pilot in Mumbai and Bengaluru.

To ensure customers get the option of digital payments in smaller towns as well, SBI will install SBI Point of Sale machines at multiple HUL touch points across the country.

Additionally, SBI will provide UPI based solutions to HUL retailers for instant cashless payments to their dealers from HUL’s retailer application “Shikhar”. This mobile application helps retailers order goods directly.

Speaking at a virtual event to announce the tie-up HUL’s Chairman & Managing Director Sanjiv Mehta said that the tie-up is done to push to digital solutions to important constituents of the ecosystem.

He believes general trade is a very important channel as it serves the needs of million of customers by making essential products available.

“This (General trade) channel also plays a significant role for our economy by creating employment opportunities for a wide spectrum of people. It is our endeavour to digitise and modernise this channel; support the retailers with right assortment and enable them to access timely and affordable funding,” Mehta added.

HUL sees this as a transformative partnership as it will help its ecosystem of traders & retailers. ""These trader ecosystems have been working in informal environment and they do not have access to credit. There is also a reluctance to adopt digital technology. So, this partnership will try to resolve these constraints,"" Mehta said.

Rajnish Kumar, Chairman of SBI said this partnership may prompt more FMCG players to adopt digital payment facilities for retailers.

The Bank will also offer HUL employees the option of a corporate salary package via an SBI microsite hosted on HUL’s intranet."

October 7. That is when the tenure of Rajnish Kumar as the Chairman of State Bank of India gets over. And that is why the date has come in play in the Jet Airways insolvency process even as lenders, sources say, meet on September 30 and start the voting process.

The moot question is: Will the airline get a new owner before Kumar completes his tenure and his successor Dinesh Kumar Khara takes over?

For that to happen, the SBI-led committee of creditors (CoC) will have to vote on the two bids presented by the two competing suitors - the consortium led by Flight Simulation Technique Centre (FSTC) and consisting of Big Charter and Imperial Capital, and the consortium led by Kalrock Capital and Murari Lal Jalan.

Sources told Moneycontrol that the voting, which will be online, could begin from September 30. ""Normally it is a long-drawn process and can take up to two weeks,"" said a senior executive. Each lender has to individually evaluate the two proposals and then cast its vote.

While another senior executive close to the banks said the outgoing SBI Chairman could hasten the process, a long weekend - starting October 2 on Friday - could make it a challenge.

The voting happens after a yet another delay in the insolvency process. On September 28, when the CoC was to meet and banks would have possibly begun voting, a decision was taken to give the two sides an opportunity to revise their offers.

This happened after the FSTC-led consortium offered to improve its resolution plan. ""The two sides have been given a few more days to resubmit their plans. They will be asked to make a presentation, and the voting will happen after that,"" a senior executive told Moneycontrol.

However, that led to the Kalrock-Jalan combine taking exception to the delay. In a strongly worded letter to the lenders on September 29, the consortium highlighted what it says is ""total disregard to the timelines set for the final submission of the resolution plan"".

The deadline for Jet Airways corporate insolvency resolution process, or CIRP, is October 21.

The letter

Following on its letter to the lenders, the Kalrock-Jalan consortium has told the banks that it is ""committed to the process"".

Interestingly, while it has asked the lenders to consider its plan submitted on September 21, the combine has said: ""We have no objection if the last commercial offer made by FSTC consortium on September 28, 2020, is considered, provided that no further extensions or opportunities are granted to them to make any further changes in their plan.""

Sources added that the FSTC-Imperial consortium has ""improved"" upon its offer, specifically on the timeline of repayment to the lenders.

Conspiracy theory

Meawhile, industry observers have come down heavily on the delay. And so have former employees of Jet Airways.

This is what one of them said:



This clearly shows how unprofessional & unprepared coc has been in managing resolution of Jet..After asking bidders for final bids by today,they have again extended submission of bids by a week...Only the bid submission date keeps extending... pathetic is the word. — Sachin (@Sachin81224590) September 30, 2020

Industry observers repeatedly cite the example of the Virgin Australia sale that was completed in five months.

While the delay has been criticised, now it has emerged that the two sides have also accused each other of having no regard for the process. The Kalrock-Jalan combine had hinted the same in its letter to the lenders, asking them ""not to allow the FSTC consortium to thwart the resolution process through unethical means"".

""Why did the lenders give more time after final bids were placed,"" asked a source.

On the other hand, some executives have questioned the Kalrock-Jalan consortium's ""hurry"" when the process deadline is October 21. ""It gives enough time. Why do they want to push the process,"" queried a senior executive.

While the FSTC consortium is being advised by consultancy Deloitte and law firm Luthra & Luthra, Alvarez & Marsal is helping the banks evaluate the bids."

""From the banking side, what I am seeing there is not too much demand (for corporate loan restructuring). It may be contrary to what the public discourse is, but as of now, the reasons could be many. One is of course a lot of clean up has already happened. In the capital, a lot of deleveraging has also happened. And more than the banks, corporates are reluctant to go for restructuring. That is the feeling I am getting,"" Kumar said, as quoted by the paper.

Kumar made the comments during the 13th Banking Colloquium organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

""So, in such a scenario the need for the restructuring would be more from the lower end of the corporates or the upper end of the MSME,"" Kumar added.

The FAQs have details on eligibility to avail the scheme and the process that needs to be followed. The section also has information about the different options with respect to the restructuring scheme.

Earlier, SBI had launched an online tool to help borrowers understand the resolution scheme for the COVID-19 pandemic-hit loans. All banks are likely to come out with similar details on their websites soon.

According to the details put out on its website, individuals and entities that are classified as standard, but not in default for more than 30 days with the bank as on March 1, 2020, and continue to remain as standard across all its loans/facilities till date are eligible for restructuring.

The customer has to be impacted financially by the COVID-19 pandemic in the form of reduction/loss of income or cash flows.

According to the FAQs, the reduction of income and its financial impact on the customer will be reviewed by the bank basis the documents/information provided, which does show the drop in cash flow due to the COVID-19 impact.

“The bank will assess the viability of the customer to pay the restructured EMIs basis the documents provided, before granting the restructuring. Apart from the viability calculations, the repayment track record of the customer, and the responses given by the customer while availing moratorium earlier will also be factored in the restructuring decision,” it said.

What is the scheme?

According to the scheme, the balance tenure of the loan can be extended by maximum of 24 months to ease the customer's monthly EMI repayment burden. The bank will levy a charge to the borrower who avails the scheme, it said.

What should customers do?

Customers can visit the bank’s website for the application link to fill the application form and submit the relevant details, or approach the relationship managers. The bank will put out the link for application on its website shortly, the bank said.

The borrower will have to submit documents giving details about the current status of his/her employment or business.

For salaried borrowers - salary slips and bank statement may be required. For self-employed borrowers/entities - bank statement, GST returns, income tax returns, Udyam certificate, etc may be required, the FAQs said.

Will it affect the credit rating?

As per the regulatory guidelines, loan/credit facility will be reported to the credit bureau as “Restructured”, the bank said.

“As per the guidelines, restructuring has to be reported at a borrower level to the credit bureaus and hence all the facilities/loans of the borrower with the bank will be classified and reported as “Restructured” even if the borrower has taken restructuring for only one loan,” the bank said.

As per regulatory and legal requirements, all borrowers/co-borrowers of the original loan need to agree and sign on any changes in the loan structure, including the restructuring agreement, the HDFC Bank FAQs said."

State Bank of India (SBI) share price gained a percent in the morning trade on September 14 after Citi maintained a buy call on the stock.

The global research firm has retained a buy call on the stock and has raised the target to Rs 320 from Rs 300 per share. It has raised FY21/FY22 estimates by 2 percent/7 percent on better NIM and lower opex, according to a CNBC-TV18 report.

The firm expects SBI to deliver better than current market perceptions on asset quality adding that concerns related to Yes Bank should also abate.

The stock price was trading at Rs 204.30, up Rs 1.60, or 0.79 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 206.20 and an intraday low of Rs 203.70.

Ashish Chaturmohta, Head of Technical and Derivatives, Sanctum Wealth Management is of the view that State Bank of India needs to cross and sustain above Rs 210 levels for any strength to emerge. In that case, the counter can move towards Rs 240-245.

According to a PTI report, due to the moratorium, a number of customers had not been paying for the first three months and the company treated them as standard accounts, which was the same in line with the rest of the industry.

After the first moratorium ended, SBI Card made it a customer-led enrolment in the second moratorium. However, a lot of customers did not enrol despite this, SBI Card Managing Director & CEO Ashwini Kumar Tewari said.

""Therefore, we had a large chunk of customers who came out of the moratorium. A lot of them paid up but many of them did not pay also."" Tewari said, adding that these payers fell into the category of delinquent customers.

""So with these delinquent customers, we are now working to enrol them either into the RBI restructuring scheme or our own repayment plans so that they get more time and better interest rate to pay their dues,"" said Tewari on September 12.

Earlier, while addressing hopes of an interest fee waiver from the SC, Tewari said “lots of customers are not convinced” but would be better off opting for the scheme to preserve their credit history.

The company has seen transactions rise to 80 percent of pre-COVID levels recently – mostly led by online spending, which is up 105 percent of pre-pandemic levels, the reports suggested.

In Q1 they had Rs 7,083 crore under moratorium which has now come down to Rs 1,500 crore, partly due to the fact that a large chunk repaid Tewari said, adding that while a large chunk of delinquent customers have not yet turned to NPA they are trying to ask them unavail the easy pay option.

State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank have started red-flagging such transactions that defy traditional company patterns.

Banks are keeping an eye on companies that have recorded a spike in trading, dealing with unrelated goods and services, or there’s a sudden outflow of money to other countries, said a report by The Economic Times.

“Since April some of the top banks have seen a jump of around 30 percent and in some cases even 50 percent where they have come across as suspicious patterns,” a person familiar with the matter said.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has been inspecting several transactions and even pulled up some of the large public sector banks for taking the mechanism of red flags “casually”, a senior bank official told ET. Regulations demand banks, non-banking finance companies and insurance companies to report suspicious transactions to FIU every month. The report suggests that there are around one million suspicious transactions reported to FIU annually.

The FIU has now initiated investigations in several cases. Banks, too, are bringing in forensic investigators to help identify these red flags. Gaganpreet Singh Puri, leader, forensic services, at PwC India, said “many companies and individuals that were using cash transactions or illegal ways to sidestep or circumvent regulations are now unable to do so"" because of the pandemic and credit contraction. “Therefore, we now see fraud issues simmering and getting called out increasingly,” he said."

Within three years of its launch, YONO, the digital banking platform of the country's largest lender SBI, has a valuation of over $40 billion, the bank's chairman Rajnish Kumar said on September 9.

The bank is also working on creating a business-to-business (B2B) platform for bill receivables, called 'Bharat Draft', which will have all the MSMEs registered, he said.

SBI had launched the YONO platform in November 2017 to help its customers' banking, investment and shopping needs.

Speaking at an event organized by ETBFSI.com, Kumar said YONO, which is an acronym for You Only Need One, is a profitable platform and rued that no one gets to know its valuation because it sits within the bank.

""Only thing is that because it is sitting in the bank, it does not get reflected in the valuations. If it was sitting outside banks, my valuation would may be $40-50 billion for YONO given the valuations which the start-ups get,"" he said.

Kumar, whose three-year term as the chairman comes to an end next month, asserted that YONO is the biggest start-up by a legacy bank. He said the bank is adding over 70,000 customers per day to the platform, and has added 2.7 crore users in the last six months, which saw an accelerated growth because of the pandemic.

The bank, which created the platform with help from consultant McKinsey and tech major IBM, makes a ""decent IRR"" (internal rate of return), Kumar said.

At present, it is giving loans of over Rs 70 crore per day through digital means, including on weekends, he said.

On the receivables platform, he said, the work has already started and it envisions getting all businesses on a single platform to ensure that entities get finance against receivables. Kumar said SBI works with start-ups in a slew of areas including cyber security and fraud prevention, and is also looking at investing in some of them.

He identified scaling up and marshalling adequate resources as challenges faced by start-ups. Kumar said the bank's board has approved a spending limit of Rs 10 crore for the management to work directly with start-ups, and added that it is aiding the bank a lot.

He said the arrival of a vaccine for coronavirus will unshackle minds of people and help restore normalcy. He also lauded the work done by his colleagues in ensuring that banking activities continue during the lockdown."

Cube Highways and Infrastructure has entered into a Rs 3,500 crore agreement with the State Bank of India (SBI) to purchase the third bundle of toll-operate-transfer (TOT) road assets auctioned by the National Highways Association of India (NHAI).

This comes after the company won the Rs 5,011 crore worth TOT3 bundle in December 2019. The TOT3 bundle comprises 2,265 km lane across four states.

Cube’s new agreement with SBI for a 20-year loan facility with an interest of 8 percent is among the largest financings in India’s road sector, Mint reported.

The SBI deal was delayed due to COVID-19 as the public lender wanted to observe pick-up in toll collections after the lifting of lockdown, a source told the paper. “With toll collections seeing a healthy recovery post unlocking of the economy, SBI was comfortable with the financing,"" they added.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Transaction of the December 2019 bundle has also been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but once through, the deals will make Cube the country’s largest roads buyer with 8,400 km of road assets across 27 highways.

NHAI’s TOT model allows companies to pay the Centre a one-time concession fee for rights to operate, maintain and collect toll on select national highway stretches for a period of 30 years."

Among the vacant posts include replacement for RBI Deputy Governor NS Vishwanathan, who decided to step down by March 31 due to ill health, three months before the end of his extended one-year tenure.

The 62-year-old was notably in-charge of the key supervisory and regulatory functions at Mint Road and it was this powerful position that led the government to offer him an extension given the mess in the banking system.

At the time of his resignation, an RBI observer said his departure will pose a challenge for the central bank to navigate the key supervisory and regulatory functions in one of its most difficult times.

Search is also still on for the next chairperson of TRAI, as tenure of current Chairman RS Sharma is set to end on September 30.

The Centre had invited applications from eligible candidates, for a term not exceeding three years or till the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier and outlined criteria as contained in the TRAI Act for a candidate with ""special knowledge of and professional experience in telecom, industry, finance, accountancy, law, and management or consumer affairs.""

TRAI has been at the forefront of major decisions related to tariffs and call connect charges, as well as recommendations on key issues like spectrum and reforming norms for transfer/merger of telecom licences.

Besides policy issues, the Supreme Court is expected to give its judgement on the AGR case on September 2, 2020. The order will have huge implications on the telecom sector.

Another post vacant is that of Managing Director of SBI after current head Rajnish Kumar steps down on October 7, 2020.

According to a notification from the Banks Board Bureau (BBB), the name of Dinesh Kumar Khara, who is one of the MDs of the bank, has been recommended as the next Chairman of SBI. Khara was supposed to retire in August 2021. If his name is finalised, Khara will get a three-year extension in the bank that is routine during the selection of new SBI chiefs.

Along with Khara, three other MDs of the bank, Arijit Basu, CS Shetty and Ashwani Bhatia were interviewed on August 28 for the chairman post.

Khara’s ascension to the chairman post would come at a time when the banking industry is facing an unprecedented challenge. The onset of COVID-19 has put the banking industry on the back foot; there is a likely build-up of huge asset quality pressure across verticals.

This can be done by the Reserve Bank monetising the state governments' debts, enlargement of Ways and Means Advances (WMA), or taking recourse to the National Small Savings Fund, they said.

The Centre on August 27 had placed before the GST Council two options for borrowing by states to meet the shortfall in Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues, pegged at Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the current fiscal. The Centre said a special window can be provided to the states, in consultation with the RBI, for borrowing at a reasonable interest rate.

The SBI economists said even though the Centre has given the states the option to borrow as much as Rs 2.35 lakh crore, Article 293 (3) of the Constitution imposes certain restrictions on the borrowings by state governments.

""The Article stipulates that a State may not, without the consent of the Government of India, raise any borrowings if it has any loan outstanding, which is repayable to the Government of India. Furthermore, under the Constitution, State Governments, unlike the Centre, cannot borrow externally,"" they said in a note.

Elaborating on their options, the economists said the option of RBI monetising the debt can be availed because the central bank is a banker to all state governments. However, they said monetisation of state debt is not exactly possible in the current circumstances and it is better if the Centre monetises the debt and gives to states.

The RBI too will be comfortable in dealing with the Centre rather than close to 30 sub-national entities, the note said.

Debt monetisation refers to purchase of government bonds by the central bank.

On enlargement of the WMA -- a facility for both the Centre and states to borrow from the RBI -- it said this can be a short-term measure as WMA is to be liquidated within 90 days' specified period. Taking recourse to NSSF, the third option, is akin to launching a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) providing an autonomous source of finance for the governments.

""It mobilises small savings through post offices and banks and used to lend against non-tradable securities issued by the States till it was discontinued in FY2017 as the special securities carried a rate of interest of 9.5 per cent that was considered too high by states,"" it said.

The states can be again allowed to tap NSSF at a concessional rate of interest so that their reliance on open market borrowings is reduced, it added."

State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender by assets, will have one of its trusted hands to lead the show at a time when the banking industry is facing an unprecedented crisis. According to a notification from the Banks Board Bureau (BBB), the name of Dinesh Kumar Khara, who is one of the MDs of the bank, has been recommended as the next Chairman of SBI.

As reported by Moneycontrol on August 18, current SBI chief Rajnish Kumar will not get an extension. His term is coming to an end on October 7. Along with Khara, three other MDs of the bank, Arijit Basu, CS Shetty and Ashwani Bhatia were interviewed on August 28 for the chairman post. Khara was supposed to retire in August 2021. If his name is finalised, Khara will get a three-year extension in the bank that is routine during the selection of new SBI chiefs.

Joined SBI as a probationary officer in 1984, Khara is a seasoned banker. He has experience across all verticals of banking such as retail Credit, SME and Corporate Credit, deposit mobilisation, international banking operations and branch management.

Within SBI circles, Khara is known as a general banking specialist. He also had a foreign stint during his three-decade-long career in SBI at the bank’s Chicago office and was associated with the overseas acquisition of Indian Ocean International Bank Mauritius during his stint in overseas expansion wing.

Khara’s colleagues remember him as an amiable officer who has grown through the ranks of SBI. “The first thing you would notice is the amiable attitude even in the midst of deadlines. At a time when the whole banking industry is in a crisis, this is a safe bet,” said an SBI insider requesting not to be named.

Over the last three decades, Khara has handled departments like associates and subsidiaries, global banking in SBI, Corporate Accounts Group and International Banking Group.

Khara holds a Masters in Business Administration from FMS New Delhi and is a post-graduate in Commerce. He is also a Certified Associate of Indian Institute of Bankers (CAIIB). Prior to being appointed as SBI MD, Khara was the MD and CEO of SBI Funds Management Pvt. Ltd.

Challenges ahead

Khara’s ascension to the chairman post comes at a time when the banking industry is facing an unprecedented challenge. The onset of COVID-19 has put the banking industry on the back foot; there is a likely build-up of huge asset quality pressure across verticals.

SBI isn’t immune to the COVID crisis.

The pain has not been felt by the banking sector so far on account of the six months moratorium given for all term loans by the Reserve Bank of India. Post the moratorium period, the RBI has offered a one-time restructuring for COVID-linked stressed loans. However, banks will have to set aside significant provisions for such loans. SBI may have a sizeable chunk of loans that could go under recast.

Warning signals

On Tuesday, global rating agency, Moody’s downgraded SBI’s standalone profile to ba2 to from ba1 reflecting Moody's view that the bank's asset quality and profitability will deteriorate. The resultant weakening in internal capital generation will reverse improvements in the bank's financial metrics achieved over the past two years” Moody’s said. Of course, SBI may not have any immediate implications on account of the downgrade in its standalone profile. The bank’s overall rating has been affirmed by Moody’s in line with the sovereign rating. However, the downgrade is a strong message to the lender that all is not well for the bank. For the new chief, managing asset quality will be the primary challenge.

Weakening asset quality

As on June 30, SBI has made a total provision of Rs 3,000 crore to cover COVID losses. Asset quality has improved. Gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio at 5.44 percent is lower than 6.15 percent in the preceding quarter. But the continuation of moratorium till August end makes current NPA numbers somewhat irrelevant.

One will have to wait and watch to see how the moratorium loan book is performing post-August 31. According to the SBI chairman, 9.5 percent of the book is now under moratorium and over 90 percent of customers have paid two or more instalments since March. From September onwards, Kumar hopes corporate accounts will start repaying normally. The bank has set aside as COVID provisions on Rs 1,041 crore of home and home-related loans and less than Rs 400 crore each in personal and SME loans.

The problem is the uncertain environment ahead. No one in the banking system, including the regulator, knows exactly how deep the bad loan problem is. That’s precisely what Moody’s has pointed out in its rating action.

Finmin-bank relation

Khara’s other challenge will be finding the right equation in his relation with the central government, which is the majority owner in the bank. SBI chairman’s job is tougher than other PSB chiefs since the lender commands a leadership position in the banking sector. SBI’s moves set trends in the banking sector. Hence SBI chief’s comments and actions will be watched closely by the government. During Rajnish’s term, there had been a few occasions when the SBI chief came under heavy criticism by the finance ministry.

Against this backdrop, Khara will have to hit the ground running and prepare his plan of action. Being an insider, Khara knows SBI culture well and has the backing of an experienced team."

The Banks Board Bureau (BBB) on August 28 recommended Dinesh Kumar Khara for the vacancy of Chairman of the State Bank of India (SBI). This means current SBI chief Rajnish Kumar, whose three-year term is set to end on October 7, is not likely to get an extension. He took charge as SBI Chairman in October, 2017.

The BBB, the headhunter for state-owned banks and financial institutions, has also recommended Challa Sreenivasulu Setty's name as the reserved list candidate for the vacancy.

The chairman of SBI is usually appointed from amongst serving managing directors of the lender. Khara, whose name has been recommended for the post by the BBB, is one of the four current managing directors of the bank, the other three being Arijit Basu, Challa Sreenivasulu Setty and Ashwani Bhatia. Bhatia was elevated to the post of Managing Director earlier this week.

India’s largest public sector bank, SBI is back on analysts’ radar despite Moody’s warning on asset quality. The stock has rallied by about 10 percent so far in the month of August after recent upgrades by top global brokerage firms.

Other than Moody's, which downgraded SBI's standalone profile to ba2 from ba1 citing deteriorating asset quality and profitability, most of the global brokerage firms see deep value in the SBI stock at current levels.

The most aggressive target price of Rs 310 has been put out by CLSA which translated into an upside of nearly 50 percent from Thursday’s closing of Rs 209.

CLSA in its August 20 note highlighted five reasons why SBI is a deep value stock. ""SBI presents a deep value opportunity, in our view, as the bank is relatively better positioned on asset quality post-COVID-19, driven by high government/PSU share in loan book,"" said the CLSA note.

""We are more comfortable on SBI’s asset quality/disclosures and hence increase our SOTP-based target price from Rs270 to Rs310, valuing core bank at 0.7x Jun-22 book and Rs131/share of sub value,"" the report added.

CLSA in the note specified that the stock is best positioned in terms of COVID-19 asset quality hit; it has gained market share; Yes Bank bailout was structured; it has best in class subsidiaries; and compelling valuations.

Most global brokerage firms say that the valuations look reasonable and the stock is trading at the attractive entry point. Goldman Sachs in its recent note on August 24 raised EPS estimates for SBI and target price to Rs 282 which translates into an upside of 35 percent from Thursday’s closing price of Rs 209. It upgraded the stock to buy from neutral.

“Current valuation (0.2x FY21E BVPS) makes for an attractive entry point as (1) Yes Bank’s tail risk is likely under control post the recent capital raising and stabilising deposit base, (2) better balance sheet and PPOP management done by SBI in this cycle, (3) steep valuation discount to ICICI Bank/Axis Bank despite much better balance sheet management,” the note added.

State Bank of India (SBI) is the oldest and the largest bank in India with more than 21,000 branches spread across the country. It has a loan book of Rs 23 trillion and deposit base of Rs 34.2 trillion, as on Q1 FY21.

The country's biggest lender State Bank of India on July 31 reported a standalone profit of Rs 4,189.34 crore for the quarter ended June 2020, a growth of 81.2 percent over the year-ago period driven by stake sale in the life insurance business, but the provisions and lower non-interest income limited growth.

SBI said its provisions only for non-performing assets at Rs 9,420.46 crore declined sequentially (down 20.8 percent) as well as year-on-year (down 19.1 percent) for the quarter ended June 2020.

SBI indicated that lending is reverting to normal levels and it has witnessed higher growth since Jun’20, with rural demand remaining resilient.

On August 27, global investment bank UBS upgraded the stock to buy from sell with a target price of Rs 260. The global investment bank is of the view that the stock is trading below the five-year average.

“Recent regulatory guidelines on restructuring and current account operations are positive for SBI. SBI is well capitalised compared with peer SOE banks; it has a provisioning coverage ratio (PCR) of 86.3% as of June 2020,” said the report.

It further added that loans under moratorium (9.5% of total term loans as of June 2020) will likely drive the magnitude of SBI’s restructuring. “We believe the current valuation is inexpensive and could fuel a rerating. We, therefore, upgrade the stock from Sell to Buy,” UBS said.

State Bank of India (SBI) is planning to foray into digital payments by setting up an entity under the Reserve Bank of India’s New Umbrella Entity (NUE) framework for retail payments. As per a research report, digital payments in India are expected to grow over three-fold to Rs 7,092 trillion by 2025.

The RBI recently released a framework to set up a pan-India umbrella entity focussing on retail payment systems. Such an entity will be a company incorporated in India under the Companies Act 2013, and may be a ‘for-profit’ or a Section 8 company as may be decided by it, the RBI said.

SBI's venture will counter the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). NPCI is a retail payments entity that supports UPI, IMPS, RuPay cards, ATM transactions and others.

As per an Economic Times' report, the public sector bank's senior management has already held preliminary discussions.

""SBI is examining the possibility of applying for a licence under the RBI's New Umbrella Entity (NUE) framework,"" ET reported, quoting an SBI official.

Under the NUE framework, entities that receive approval can set up a payments company for owning and operating a pan-India digital payments network, exercising the same powers as NPCI.

The SBI spokesperson told ET that it is ""examining"" the NUE framework, adding that the bank could leverage its scale, massive customer base and existing capabilities to offer new digital services.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

If given a green signal, SBI will need a minimum paid-up capital of Rs 500 crore. Out of this, Rs 50 crore will have to be brought at the time of application and a constant paid-up capital of Rs 300 crore will have to be maintained at all times, as per RBI guidelines.

SBI's entity has to be interoperable with NPCI, as per the guidelines.

The RBI has mandated interoperability between NPCI and new players so that consumers are not affected and instead will have more choices.

Aspirants can apply to set up an umbrella entity till February 26, 2021.

Notably, RedSeer Consulting, in its latest research report, said that India's digital payment market was worth around Rs 2,162 trillion in 2019-20.

""The current 160 million unique mobile payment users will multiply by 5 times to reach nearly 800 million by 2025. This growth will be driven by a number of demand and supply-side drivers,"" the Bengaluru-based management consultancy said.

According to the report, the payment gateway aggregator market in India, which is currently estimated to be at Rs 9.5 trillion, is expected to grow by 2.4 times driven by large value transactions. It is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 19 percent in the next 5 years to reach Rs 22.6 trillion by FY 2025."

Shares of IndusInd Bank surged over 9 percent while those of State Bank of India (SBI) climbed over 3 percent in intraday trade on BSE on August 27 after the global financial firm UBS upgraded the stocks to 'buy' from 'sell'.

""Bank stocks are down 12-62 percent year-to-date and have underperformed the broader markets. We think the sector’s downside risks are limited and upgrade IndusInd Bank and SBI from sell to buy,"" UBS said in a note.

UBS has a target price for IndusInd bank at Rs 675 and for SBI at Rs 260.

""We reduce FY21E GNPL formation and credit costs but raise our NIM estimates, resulting in a 17-115 percent lift in FY21E earnings for the banks we cover. Our estimates are 4-30 percent higher than consensus for select coverage banks,"" UBS said.

""Stocks are trading below the five-year average and we expect most of the banks to trade near their five-year average valuations. Though we think asset quality risks for IndusInd Bank and SBI remain higher than peers, we believe current valuations reflect most negatives, driving our upgrades,"" UBS added.

UBS is of the view that the government and RBI relief measures in terms of additional liquidity infusion, guaranteed funding for SMEs, and loan restructuring rules for all segments, in the past few months, have reduced tail risks in the banking system.

The court restrained Ambani from selling and transferring personal assets.

Arguing against the stay order, Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) and SBI said that it would open the floodgates for similar cases where promoters try to escape personal guarantee.

SBI's counsel further said that Ambani was looking to derail proceedings.

""A stay on the recovery proceedings allows the guarantor to fritter away assets to avoid recovery,"" SBI told HC.

Ambani moved the Delhi High Court against the appointment of a resolution professional (RP) on the personal guarantee given by him against a loan taken by Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) and Reliance Infratel Ltd (RITL) from SBI.

On August 20, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in Mumbai had allowed the appointment of an interim resolution professional (RP) in a case filed by State Bank of India against the chairman of Reliance Communications over the company's Rs 1,200 crore loan default.

Ambani furnished his personal guarantee along with other collateral to avail the loan. The lender moved NCLT after the company had failed to pay up its dues even after invoking the personal guarantee.

""Sec 60(2) clearly provides for proceedings to be launched against personal guarantors, running parallel to CIRP. Fallacious to assume that no action can be taken against guarantors until Resolution Plan is accepted,"" the order issued on August 20 said.

The HC issued notices to SBI and Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The matter will be next heard on October 6.

In August 2016, SBI had issued loans of Rs 565 crore and Rs 635 crore to Reliance Communications and RTIL, respectively. In September 2016, Anil Ambani provided a personal guarantee for availing the credit facility.

Later in 2017, accounts of R.Comm and RITL were held to be in default, retrospectively, since Aug 2016. In January 2018, SBI invoked the personal guarantee issued by Anil Ambani.

Subsequently, in February 2020, SBI issued a demand notice to Anil Ambani seeking recovery of dues to which there was no response received.

Recently, Chinese Banks had secured an order from the UK courts to recover Rs 5,447 crore loans given to Reliance Communications. SBI fears that upon non-payment of Rs 5,447 crore to Chinese banks, they are likely to invoke similar personal guarantees issued by Anil Ambani to them.

According to the SBI, recovery proceedings, or invocation of personal guarantees of Anil Ambani by the Chinese would adversely affect recovery proceedings in India under IBC."

While announcing the first quarter result, State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar made an interesting comment. “It is safe to presume that as on June 30, SBI is declared as asymptomatic and has built good immunity,"" Kumar said referring to bank’s preparedness to absorb the losses arising from the impact of the pandemic. Kumar probably meant the bank has made sufficient precautions to cover COVID-related losses and is fully prepared to face the asset quality shocks ahead.

However, the downgrade on SBI’s standalone profile to ba2 to from ba1 on Tuesday by Moody’s rating agency is a stern reminder to Kumar that his confidence may be a bit misplaced. After all, SBI may not be “asymptomatic” and there could be negative surprises to the banking major in the post moratorium period.

“The downgrade of SBI's BCA to ba2 from ba1 reflects Moody's view that the bank's asset quality and profitability will deteriorate. The resultant weakening in internal capital generation will reverse improvements in the bank's financial metrics achieved over the past two years” Moody’s said.

SBI may not have any immediate implications on account of the downgrade in its standalone profile. The bank’s overall rating has been affirmed by Moody’s in line with the sovereign rating. However, the downgrade is a strong message to the lender that all is not well for the bank.

SBI’s numbers

As on June 30, SBI has made a total provision of Rs 3,000 crore to cover COVID losses. Asset quality has improved. Gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio at 5.44 percent is lower than 6.15 percent in the preceding quarter. But the continuation of moratorium till August end makes current NPA numbers somewhat irrelevant.

One will have to wait and watch to see how the moratorium loan book is performing post-August 31. According to the SBI chairman, 9.5 percent of the book is now under moratorium and over 90 percent of customers have paid two or more instalments since March. From September onwards, Kumar hopes corporate accounts will start repaying normally. The bank has set aside as COVID provisions on Rs 1,041 crore of home and home-related loans and less than Rs 400 crore each in personal and SME loans.

The problem is the uncertain environment ahead. No one in the banking system, including the regulator, knows exactly how deep the bad loan problem is. That’s precisely what Moody’s has pointed out.

Moody’s warning

Moody’s did not buy SBI’s optimism on improved NPA situation. “SBI's asset quality improved in the quarter ended June 2020. However, the ratio is potentially understated because it does not include loans on which the bank has granted payment deferrals,” Moody’said.

The RBI has announced a one-time restructuring for banks to address the stressed loans linked to COVID in the post moratorium period. “In line with the trend for other Indian peers, Moody's expects SBI to restructure loans. However, uncertainty around the length and depth of India's economic slowdown makes it difficult to estimate what portion of restructured loans will eventually turn into non-performing loans,” Moody’s has said.

Moody's finds SBI's capitalisation -- as measured by tangible common equity (TCE) relative to adjusted risk-weighted assets of 8.5 percent as of March 2020 -- low when compared to similarly rated global peers.

“While SBI's stakes in listed subsidiaries present potential sources of capital, Moody's expects that the bank's sustainable capitalization will be lower than global peers, in line with the expectation of the bank's management,” the agency said.

The fact is both moratorium and one-time restructuring will only provide a temporary breather to SBI in the COVID crisis. The RBI has insisted a 10 per cent provisioning on loans that are restructured under the one-time provision, which means banks will have corresponding capital implications while opting for this scheme. SBI will have to raise a significant amount of capital to prepare for the COVID battle."

Moody's Investors Service has downgraded State Bank of India's standalone profile to ba2 from ba1 saying it sees SBI's asset quality and profitability deteriorating.

The rating agency, however, affirmed SBI's long term local and foreign currency deposit ratings at Baa3, the same level as India's sovereign rating.

""The downgrade of SBI's BCA to ba2 from ba1 reflects Moody's view that the bank's asset quality and profitability will deteriorate. The resultant weakening in the internal capital generation will reverse improvements in the bank's financial metrics achieved over the past two years,"" Moody's said in a report.

SBI's ba2 BCA takes into account the bank's strong funding and liquidity a result of its dominant market position, and its important links to government transaction-related businesses which support its stable funding franchise. As of the end of March 2020, SBI's liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was healthy at 134 percent, as per the report.

Prior to the review for downgrade, Moody's had expected that improvements to SBI's asset quality and profitability would result in financial metrics in line with global peers with ba1 BCAs, it said.

Prolonged financial stress among rural households, weak job creation and a credit crunch among non-bank financial companies will lead to a rise in non-performing loans, delaying the ongoing clean-up of bank's balance sheet over the past two years, Moody's said in the report."

Anil Ambani had furnished his person guarantee along with other collateral to avail the loan. The lender moved NCLT after the company failed to pay up its dues even after invoking the personal guarantee.

The case is related to SBI giving credit facilities to Reliance Communications (R.Comm) and Reliance Telecom Infrastructure Ltd (RTIL), companies under the Reliance ADAG group headed by Anil Ambani, in August 2016.

A spokesperson of Anil Ambani has said the company is reviewing the NCLT order and taking advice on filing appropriate appeal against appointment of the RP.

The appointment of an RP does not constitute admission of SBI's application. The NCLT order directing appointment of the resolution professional does not constitute an admission of SBI's insolvency application by the NCLT, the spokesperson noted.

""The resolution professional will examine SBI's insolvency application against Anil Ambani and then submit a report to the NCLT.""

The spokesperson also clarified that NCLT order will have no bearing on the operations of Reliance Infrastructure Limited, Reliance Power Limited and Reliance Capital Limited.

In its order, NCLT observed that the RCOM and RITL committed default in repayment in and around January 2017. The accounts were retrospectively declared as Non-Performing Account (NPA) with effect from 26.08.2016 i.e. even before loan agreements had been entered into.

The order further states, ""Such retrospective declaration seems rather incongruous, akin to the adage 'putting the cart before the horse'. While debt and default has remained undisputed, the incongruity of declaration of NPA, has not been raised and contested by the Respondent. Besides, reappraisal of the declaration of the NPA by this Authority would not fall within the ambit of the provisions of the Code, under which the instant Applications have been made.""

Moreover it maintained that it is wrong to assume that no action can be taken until a resolution plan is accepted.

""Sec 60(2) clearly provides for proceedings to be launched against personal guarantors, running parallel to CIRP. Fallacious to assume that no action can be taken against guarantors until Resolution Plan is accepted,"" says the order issued on August 20.

Loans of Rs 565 crore and Rs 635 crore were given to Reliance Communications and RTIL respectively in August 2016 by SBI.

In September 2016, Anil Ambani provided a personal guarantee for availing the credit facility.

Later in 2017, accounts of R.Comm and RITL were held to be in default, retrospectively, since Aug 2016.

In January 2018, SBI invoked the personal guarantee issued by Anil Ambani.

CLSA has retained a buy call on the stock and has raised target price to Rs 310 from Rs 270 per share. It is of the view that the company presents a deep value opportunity. It is relatively better positioned on asset quality post-COVID, according to a CNBC-TV18 report.

]The stock price was trading at Rs 199.05, up Rs 4.35, or 2.23 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 199.25 and an intraday low of Rs 197.50.

It was also one of the most active stocks on NSE in terms of value with 56,51,247 shares being traded.

State Bank of India is planning to raise as much Rs 10,000 crore through a sale of tier-II bonds.

Three Managing Directors of State Bank of India (SBI) are in the race for the Chairman’s post to succeed current top boss Rajnish Kumar, whose term is ending in October this year.

The interview to select the new chairman will likely take place this month. The contenders are Dinesh Kumar Khara, Arijit Basu and C S Shetty, according to people familiar with the development. All three have nearly three decades of experience across different verticals in the bank.

There is a possibility of a fourth candidate also being called from the SBI’s ranks, one person quoted above said. But, this person’s participation depends if he gets clearance from the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) ahead of the interview date, the person said.

SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar’s term is ending on October 7. He took charge as SBI Chairman in October, 2017. SBI typically picks its new chief from among the MDs.

Recently, there was a media report suggesting that Rajnish Kumar has been asked to attend the interview along with other candidates. However, this possibility is unlikely and no information has reached on this with either the bank or Kumar on this yet.

“This mere speculation at this stage. There is no information so far,” said one of the officials quoted earlier.

“If Kumar is to be given an extension, he can be given without an interview,” the official said.

Kumar’s predecessor, Arundhati Bahttacharya was given an extension in 2016 to facilitate the merger of SBI with associates. There was no interview conducted then.

The new SBI chairman will have a tough task ahead as the banking sector is going through a major crisis hit by the COVID-19 onslaught. As on June 30, SBI has made a total provision of Rs 3,000 crore to cover potential COVID losses.

Gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio at 5.44 percent is lower than 6.15 percent in the preceding quarter. But the continuation of moratorium till August makes current NPA numbers somewhat irrelevant.

About 9.5 percent of the SBI’s loan book is now under moratorium and over 90 percent of customers have paid two or more instalments since March.

In his tenure, Kumar has managed to lead the bank with relatively better asset quality trends at a time when the entire industry is neck-deep in a bad loan crisis post the 2015 asset quality review.

Kumar has expressed confidence of bank’s business performance going ahead. On July 31, during the press conference announcing the June quarter results of SBI, Kumar made an interesting analogy, comparing the bank’s business position to a COVID-19 infected person.

“It is safe to presume that as on June 30, SBI is declared as asymptomatic and has built good immunity,"" Kumar said referring to bank’s preparedness to absorb the losses arising from the impact of the pandemic. “But that is not a guarantee on what will happen in future,” he added."
"August 17, 2020 11:47 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/exclusive-sbi-boi-extend-banking-agents-covid-allowance-to-september-5719171.html,"State Bank of India and Bank of India have decided to extend through September a special coronavirus allowance being paid to banking agents who have played a vital role in ensuring that the government’s financial support reached the rural poor, especially during the pandemic.

In letters to officials and business correspondents—as the banking agents are known—both the state-owned lenders have said financial support will continue for these agents who ensure that people in villages can access money that comes into their account under the direct benefit transfer (DBT) plan. Moneycontrol has seen copies of both the letters.

Bank of India said for July, the agents will be paid a daily additional commission of Rs 75, Rs 50 in August and Rs 25 in September. The only condition is reporting at least 10 digital banking services per day.

The SBI has approved Rs 2,000 for August and Rs 1,000 for September for the customer service point, given the business is active for at least 21 days in a month.

Beyond that, SBI has approved Rs 2 per transaction for a minimum of 40 transactions per day.

The banks had not responded to Moneycontrol's email queries at the time of publishing of this report.

The move will benefit the sector, industry insiders feel, when rural consumption was slowing down.

The direct transfer of Rs 500 a month to women aided rural businesses. Now that it is not being renewed, the rural areas, which seemed to have largely escaped the economic damage seen in urban areas, are staring at a difficult time.

Slowdown comes to villages

Business correspondents work with banks offering payments, cash deposits, withdrawals and other services across rural and semi-urban India.

In the first three months of the viral outbreak and the lockdown, rural consumers used these banking channels to withdraw the DBT money for sustenance.

These helped business volumes remain high even at a time when the overall economic activity had taken a hit.



“For July and a large part of August, we are seeing transactions slowing down by almost 20 percent from pre-COVID levels, even in terms of value transactions,” said Seema Prem, chief executive officer, FIA Global, which

works with public sector banks across India.

Prem said that the government should look to restart the scheme for the next few months to ensure that the rural consumption story continues. Since the slowdown was a countrywide phenomenon, it would help the rural poor at a time when work in large cities had slowed down because of the pandemic.

“Interestingly till July, the average balance in the account of these consumers had gone up by 17 percent that was primarily because of DBT money. Now as withdrawal transactions have slowed down, this indicates overall people are spending less,” she added

As per numbers accessed from NPCI, AePS transactions had jumped during the first few months of Covid-19 but slowed down in July and are expected to drop further in August.

In July, 328 million AePS transactions were recorded, compared to around 400 million transactions between April, May and June, the three months of COVID-special DBT.

Sunil Kulkarni, a spokesperson for the BC Federation of India, said that given the government’s move towards helping MSMEs and restarting the economy instead of extending the financial support through COVID-special DBT or similar payouts, he didn’t expect these measures to be continued.

“The entire country is going through financial stress and the rural economy is not immune from the COVID-induced financial shock. Now, as more industries reopen and workers start finding jobs again, hopefully, the domestic remittance and consumption economy will pick up gradually,” he said.

He expects the financial stress to reduce gradually but continue at least till December.

Industry insiders say domestic remittance, an important source of money for rural India, dropped 80 percent after March when the lockdown was announced in the last week. The number is slowly coming back but it was painfully slow.

The fact that some large PSBs have taken the initiative to support last-mile agents is a helpful move, they say."

The novel coronavirus pandemic has led to a massive surge in digital transactions as customers maintain their distance from bank branches. Data from leading lenders confirms the trend.

The share of alternative channels in the total transactions for State Bank of India increased to 93 percent in the first quarter ended June 30 from 90 percent in the same period last year, SBI executive said as per a report by Hindu BusinessLine.

""We are seeing a lot of traction in the bank’s technology platform, YONO,"" he said.

Similarly, for ICICI Bank, more than 90 percent of savings account transactions in the first quarter came through digital channels. The share was 87 percent during the same period last year.

""We have been able to connect to over four lakh customers on a daily basis using cloud telephony and voice bots to counsel them on using technology,"" said Rakesh Jha, CFO, ICICI Bank.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

“COVID-19 has had almost the same positive impact as demonetisation,"" said Prabhu Ram, Managing Director and Group CEO of Payswiff, a payment transaction solution provider.

""Even the traditional payments, like payments to milkman and paperboy have gone digital now because people fear touching currency notes,"" Ram added.

Digital payments in the country should touch 1.5 billion transactions a day if they keep growing at the current rate and the Reserve Bank of India is putting in place systems to support the growth, a top official of the central bank had said.

As many as 100 million digital transactions were being recorded daily in the country against 120 million reported before the coronavirus outbreak, said P Vasudevan, chief general manager, department of payments and settlement systems at the Reserve Bank of India.

“For context, in 2016 we were doing 22 million, now we are at 100 million, this shows that digital transactions are growing at an annual growth rate of 58 percent and the future of digital payments is tremendous and sizeable,” Vasudevan had said at the virtual Global Fintech Fest on July 22.

Markets regulator Sebi on August 14 imposed a penalty of Rs 10 lakh each on three public sector financial institutions -- SBI, LIC and Bank of Baroda -- for not complying with the mutual fund norms.

Sebi observed that State Bank of India (SBI), Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and Bank of Baroda (BoB) are the sponsors of SBI Mutual Fund, LIC Mutual Fund and Baroda Mutual Fund, respectively, and they also hold more than 10 percent stake each in these mutual funds.

In addition, LIC, SBI and BoB are also sponsors of UTI AMC and hold more than 10 percent stake individually in the asset management company (AMC) and trustee company of UTI MF.

This is not in conformity with the requirement of mutual fund regulations, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in three separate orders.

The regulator amended the mutual fund regulations in March 2018, wherein a shareholder or a sponsor owning at least 10 percent stake in an AMC is not allowed to have 10 percent or more stake in another mutual fund house operating in the country.

Entities not in compliance with the requirement was given time up to March 2019 to comply with the requirement.

UTI AMC is promoted by four public sector financial institutions as sponsors -- SBI, LIC, BoB and Punjab National Bank (PNB) -- with each of them currently holding an 18.24 percent stake in the fund house, while private equity firm T Rowe Price International holds 26 percent stake in UTI AMC.

Sebi noted that the three entities have not denied the fact that they have not complied with the provisions of MF regulations although they stated that the IPO (initial public offering) process for divestment of their shareholding in UTI AMC has been initiated and sale of its stake in UTI Trustee company is in the process of finalisation.

They further said the IPO of UTI AMC will be completed by September-end.

Sebi, in the orders, said the entities have violated the provision of mutual fund norms and are liable for penalty. Accordingly, the regulator has imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh each on them.

In December 2019, it directed the three entities to dilute their stake to below 10 percent in UTI AMC by December 2020. In this regard, the regulator said ""the proceedings initiated against the entities wherein order has been passed by Sebi's whole time member and the present adjudication proceedings are two separate proceedings and does not have bearing on one another.""

It had added that Sebi may initiate action against the entities for the non-compliance with the provisions of mutual fund norms."

State Bank of India (SBI) on August 12 filed a plea in the Supreme Court (SC), requesting approval to intervene on behalf of Reliance Communications in the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) case.

SBI said that outstanding payments to operational creditors are prioritised over financial creditors during a resolution plan, according to a Business Standard report.

The interests of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) are sufficiently protected under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) since the telecom regulator is an operational creditor, the lender said.

SBI filed the plea on behalf of RCom's Committee of Creditors (CoC), which includes Bank of Baroda, Axis Bank, UCO Bank, Punjab National Bank, HDFC, and LIC.

The amount recoverable from RCom is Rs 31,000 crore (inclusive of spectrum usage and licensing charges), Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the apex court on August 10.

The DoT had calculated RCom's AGR-related dues at around Rs 25,000 crore.

During the previous SC hearing in the AGR case, Justice Arun Mishra said, ""We want to go into the cause for initiation of insolvency against telcos under the IBC"".

The SC had asked for a plan to recover AGR dues from telecom companies going through insolvency proceedings, such as RCom and Aircel.

The SC will next hear the AGR case at 3 pm on August 14, and might give a verdict on the subject of staggered payments."

State Bank of India (SBI) share price traded higher by a percent at open on August 3 after it reported a standalone profit of Rs 4,189.34 crore for the quarter ended June 2020, a growth of 81.2 percent over a year-ago period driven by stake sale in life insurance business.

Provisions and lower non-interest income limited growth in profit.

Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, increased 16.1 percent to Rs 26,641.56 crore in June quarter compared to Rs 22,938.8 crore in year-ago period.

Profit as well as NII both were ahead of a CNBC-TV18 poll estimates of Rs 3,222.2 crore and Rs 23,940.3 crore respectively.

In June this year, SBI sold 2.1 percent equity stake in SBI Life Insurance Company via offer for sale route to comply with shareholding norms and raised Rs 1,539.73 crore.

Asset quality improved significantly in the quarter ended June 2020, with gross non-performing assets (NPA) as a percentage of gross advances falling 71 bps QoQ to 5.44 percent and net NPA declining 37 bps QoQ to 1.86 percent.

CLSA has a buy call on the stock and has raised target to Rs 270 from Rs 240 per share. It is of the view that Q1 was better than expected with a +16/+20 percent YoY NII/Core PPOP growth, according to a CNBC-TV18 report.

Moratorium-2 Book came from 25 percent of loans to 9.5 percent of loans. It has increased FY22/23 estimates by 40/6 percent and Expect RoE of 8.5/11 percent in FY22/23. Current Valuation is undemanding as well and has factored in Rs 15,000 crore of capital raise in FY21, the brokerage firm added.

Japanese broking firm Nomura also has a buy rating with target at Rs 230 per share. It is of the view that the PSU bank delivered a strong operating performance with sustainability being the key. Banks should be able to navigate current cycle well. Overall core PPoP/Asset and a weak capital position are concerning.

Current valuations of SBI look undemanding, despite weak RoE trajectory, it added.

Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained a buy with target at Rs 340 per share. The bank reported 80 percent YoY earnings growth led by 35 percent YoY operating profit growth. Moratorium ratio, not strictly comparable which is at 10 percent of loans, it said

The firm is of the view that the retail book should hold up bettera and sees a lower-than-expected impact on the bank through COVID-19.

Morgan Stanley has an equal-weight rating on the stock and has increased the target increased to Rs 215 from Rs 205 per share. The firm is of the view that the bank had a good Q1 on better than expected margin, strong deposit growth and lower moratorium.

Macro climate is tough and will weigh on margin and asset quality in H2. It has raised FY21/22/23 EPS estimates by 10/5/5 percent respectively.

State Bank of India (SBI) share price gained 2 percent intraday on July 31 ahead of its June quarter earnings. The bank is expected to see sharp spike in Q1FY21 profitability led by stake sale in life insurance business, but likely additional COVID-19 provisions may limit the growth.

The growth in net interest income could be around 10 percent year-on-year for the quarter, with loan growth at around 7 percent and stable net interest margin for the quarter.

The stock price was trading at Rs 191.30, up Rs 4.75, or 2.55 percent at 09:54 hours. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 191.55 and an intraday low of Rs 186.85.

It was also one of the most active stocks on NSE in terms of volumes with 1,63,92,832 shares being traded.

Brokerages expect improvement in asset quality on sequential basis with lower slippages than Q4FY20, while provisions could see increase on YoY basis due to COVID-19 but sequentially provisions could be lower.

""We expect higher focus on NII (13 percent YoY) given the recent cuts in lending yields and deposit rates. Loan growth will be subdued at around 7 percent YoY and NIM (core) unchanged QoQ at around 2.95 percent. Treasury income would include gains on account of stake-sale in SBI Life Insurance,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees 191 percent YoY growth in profit and 39 percent in pre-provision operating profit (PPoP).

Kotak expects slippages at 2 percent of loans mostly from agriculture (seasonal unless under moratorium), SME loans. It expects moratorium ratio to decline further and mostly led by the retail/SME segment.

""We expect slippages mostly from SME loans, but the pace of accretion to be largely better than Q4,"" said Sharekhan.

ICICI Securities also feels the moratorium of 23 percent is expected to decline in line with peers led by retail & SME segments. ""We factor in higher slippages in agri due to seasonality and loan loss provisions of Rs 9,670 crore and overall provisions at Rs 10,360 crore versus Rs 13,495 crore in Q4FY20, which had excess provisions booked. Hence, net profit is likely to grow 100 percent YoY and 31 percent QoQ.""

As many as 8.5 lakh bank employees are set to benefit from the wage hike, which will be effective from November 2017.

Under the agreement reached on Wednesday, Performance Linked Incentive (PLI) will also be introduced for public sector bank staff and it will be based on operating or net profit of individual banks concerned. Basic pay has been merged with dearness allowance, the IBA said in a statement.

Close to 37 banks, including public, private and foreign banks, have mandated the IBA to negotiate with unions on wage hikes for their employees.

The annual wage increase in salary and allowances has been agreed at 15 percent of the wage bill as on March 31, 2017, which works out to be Rs 7,898 crore on payslip components, as per the agreement signed between the IBA and bank unions.

The agreement on the 15 percent annual wage hike was reached at a meeting between the IBA and members of the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) representing workmen unions and officers association.

PLI will be applicable for public sector banks from the current fiscal, while it will be optional for private and foreign banks.

There will also be an increase the banks' contribution to the NPS (New Pension Scheme) fund to 14 percent -- 14 percent of pay and dearness allowance -- instead of the present 10 per cent from the prospective date of signing the settlement subject to the approval of the government, according to the agreement.

""Today IBA & UFBU have signed an MoU for 15% increase in pay slip component of Bank Employees, in Principal agreement to remove cap & offer 30% of Basic Pay as family Pension,"" IBA Chief Executive Officer Sunil Mehta said in a tweet.

As many as 35 rounds of negotiation meetings took place before reaching the common ground and the outcome is satisfying, All India Bank Employees Association General Secretary CH Venkatachalam said.

Details on the implementation of wage hike and allowances are likely to be finalised in the next few days.

The last round of negotiation happened on March 16 before the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, he said, adding the wage hike will benefit about 8.5 lakh employees and officers. '

During a round of wage negotiations in May 2018, IBA had offered only two per cent wage hike. In protest, bank unions had also gone on a two-day strike from May 30 that year.

The parties will endeavour to finalise the Bipartite Settlement within a period of 90 days from July 22, the agreement said.

Once concluded, this would be the 11th Bipartite Settlement. The 10th Bipartite Settlement ended in October 2017.

In the 10th Bipartite wage settlement, which was signed in May 2015, for the period between November 2012 and October 2017, the IBA had offered a 15 percent hike.

As per the latest agreement, the PLI would be payable to all employees annually over and above the normal salary payable.

""In today's banking scenario, there is stiff competition amongst different categories of banks that are public, private, foreign banks. In order to inculcate a sense of competition and also to reward performance, the concept of PLI is felt to be introduced,"" the agreement said.

The quantum of PLI will be nil if the operating profit earned by a bank is less than 5 per cent.

If the operating profit is between 5-10 percent, employees would be entitled to get an additional five days salary, An additional 15 days salary will be given in case of operating profit exceeding 15 percent on an annual basis. The latter will be applicable only if the bank concerned has a net profit."

State-run lender State Bank of India (SBI) has recovered only slightly over 7 percent of the bad loans written off during the past eight years.

Out of Rs 1,23,432 crore written off by SBI during from FY13 to FY20, the bank recovered only Rs 8,969 crore, according to a Moneylife report.

The report cited the bank's reply to Vivek Velankar, who is a shareholder of SBI.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

Velankar, president of Pune-based Sajag Nagrik Manch, told Moneylife that he had first attempted getting this information through a Right to Information (RTI) request.

Also read: Government scheme loans have higher NPAs, corporate loans 'under control', says SBI chief Rajnish Kumar

The RTI request was denied by the bank, with the reason that collating the information would be a waste for resources, the report said.

""I did not get a chance to ask my question during the AGM, but the bank shared this information, which is quite shocking. This also exposes how the bank writes off loans of 100s of crores of rupees of large defaulters while denying waiver of simple interest on loans for common customers,"" Velankar told the magazine.

The documents provided by SBI to Velankar reveal that the bank's largest defaulters are Bhushan Power & Steel, IRVCL and Videocon Industries, who have paid any amount of their loans that were written off.

The document mentions Alok Industries as SBI's largest borrower, but the company has repaid 1,703.57 crore out of Rs 8,098.05 crore which was written off."

Country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) expects to save Rs 1,000 crore by instituting Work from Anywhere, chairman Rajnish Kumar said in his speech at the 65th Annual General Meeting of the bank.

“The Bank will institute Work from Anywhere (WFA) infrastructure to facilitate work from any location, while taking care of the social aspects of work-life balance. The measure is expected to save Rs 1,000 crore through cost optimisation and will be a key component of our business continuity during the times of COVID-19,” Rajnish Kumar said.

In the 2019-20 annual report, Kumar had said: “With global acceptability of Work-from-Home (WFH) arrangements, the bank is in the process of upgrading its existing WFH policy to WFA. Productivity tools and technology are already in place to perform administrative work remotely.”

Kumar’s logic was that WFA would reduce commute time, and, hence, ensure better services and better work-life balance. “This is expected to drive down the operational cost for the bank, besides ensuring better motivation and productivity for staff members,” the SBI Chairman said.

SBI has about 2.5 lakh employees and 24,000 branches across different states, including far-flung rural areas where people are still taking baby steps into the world of formal banking.

The focus, going ahead, will be on cost reduction, rationalisation and re-skilling of workforce, improving staff productivity and redeployment of workforce from admin offices to sales roles. Bank will maintain a constant vigil on the emerging stress and take proactive action, to help our borrower customers and maintain asset quality, Kumar said.

“An elaborate business continuity plan is already in place. The Bank has stepped up its monitoring of all the projects under implementation and expects to tide over COVID impact in the short to medium term,” Kumar said.

Bank’s performance

Despite the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic towards the end, SBI’s total deposits grew at a faster rate of 11.34 percent in 2019-20, compared to industry growth of 7.9 percent, to Rs 32.42 lakh crore from the previous year’s level of Rs 29.11 lakh crore. The foreign offices deposits grew by 20.45 percent to Rs 1.17 lakh crore, while domestic deposits grew by 11.03 percent to Rs 31.25 lakh crore, Kumar said.

SBI’s domestic advances grew by 3.75 percent to Rs 20.65 lakh crore, while the foreign offices advances grew at 18.05 percent to Rs 3.57 lakh crore. “Therefore, the gross advances of SBI grew by 5.64 percent to the level of Rs 24.23 lakh crore in FY20 from the previous year level of Rs 22.93 lakh crore. Much of the growth in domestic advances came from personal segment including Home Loans,” Kumar said.

However, the corporate Loan book has declined marginally by 0.87 percent to Rs 8.44 lakh crore in FY20, in line with the Banking industry’s growth trend.

“Major share of the credit went into sectors such as Infrastructure (Power, Roads & Ports) and Services especially Commercial Real Estate and NBFCs. The Corporate Loan book accounts for 38.9 per cent share of PSUs/Govt. sector or the GoI undertakings,” Kumar said."

A calibrated call rather than ""sudden stops"" is required to lower India's import dependence on China, the country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has said in a research report.

In terms of numbers, India's dependence on China is the heaviest in low-value imports, said the report that comes at a time when India is looking to address the trade imbalance with its biggest trading partner amid a prolonged and bloody border standoff.

“Clearly, China has slowly and steadily built a solid base in both high and low-value imports into India. We thus have to clearly take a calibrated call in reducing our import dependence from China and not through sudden stops,” said the report.

In the last few weeks, FDI norms for investors from China have been tightened, 59 Chinese apps banned, contracts put on hold and tenders scrapped.

The ties between the two countries are in a free-fall after a clash along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15 killed 20 Indian and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers.

China accounts for 18 percent of India’s imports and only 9 percent exports. The bilateral trade amounted to $103.5 billion in the April 2019-February 2020 period.

""At an 8-digit level, there were humongous 6,844 products imported by India from China. The good thing is that for FY20 compared to FY19, there is a drastic reduction in the value of products in which India's import dependence on China was between 50-60 percent,"" the report said.

Over 800 products (worth $3,944 million) from China with an import value of less than $100 million each account for more than 90 percent of India's imports, the report said.

Also read: Exclusive | India likely to announce hike in duty on imports from China in next two-three months

Such products include organic chemicals, machinery and mechanical appliances and electrical machinery, textiles and textile articles, products made of iron and steel, toys, and furniture.







""Although the ban on 59 Chinese apps, which are quite popular in India, is based on security concerns, it does provide the local tech companies the space to develop apps which can compete with them. India ,with its huge IT base can thus focus more on services while building capabilities in goods exports will take more me to improve its overall trade balance,"" the SBI report said.







The ban, it said, gave domestic firms an opportunity to develop apps that can compete with the banned Chinese ones.

The Centre on June 29 banned 59 Chinese apps, including popular video sharing platform TikTok, citing threats to national security.

Citing anecdotal evidence, the report said local business players find it less difficult to conduct business in China. Data also suggests that while it is cheaper to export from India rather import to India, the time required to meet border and regulatory compliance requirements is one reason why business players prefer China.

""We do have a cost advantage in exports but we need to increase the efficiency to successfully overtake China,"" the report said, highlighting one of the reasons why the country is the world's manufacturing hub."

The finance ministry on July 7 said banks have sanctioned loans of about Rs 1,14,502 crore under the Rs 3-lakh crore Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) for MSME sector reeling under the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, disbursements against this stood at Rs 56,091.18 lakh crore till July 4 under the 100 per cent ECLGS for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

The scheme is the biggest fiscal component of the Rs 20-lakh crore 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan' package announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in May.

The latest numbers on ECLGS, as released by the finance ministry, comprise disbursements by all 12 public sector banks (PSBs), 20 private sector banks and 10 non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).

""As of 4 July 2020, the total amount sanctioned under the 100% Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme by #PSBs and private banks stands at Rs 1,14,502.58 crore, of which Rs 56,091.18 crore has already been disbursed,"" the finance minister said in a tweet.

Under the ECLGS, the loan amounts sanctioned by PSBs increased to Rs 65,863.63 crore, of which Rs 35,575.48 crore has been disbursed as of July 4, she said.

At the same time, private sector banks have sanctioned Rs 48,638.96 crore and disbursed Rs 20,515.70 crore.

""Compared to 1 July 2020, there is an increase of Rs 4,158.51 crore in the cumulative amount of loans sanctioned and an increase of Rs 3,835.65 crore in the cumulative amount of loans disbursed, by both #PSBs and private sector banks combined as on 4 July 2020,"" Sitharaman said.

Market leader SBI has sanctioned Rs 20,628 crore of loans and disbursed Rs 13,405 crore. It is followed by Punjab National Bank, which has sanctioned Rs 8,689 crore. However, its disbursements stood at Rs 2,595 crore as of July 4.

The business units of Maharashtra have got the highest cumulative sanction of Rs 6,856 crore from banks, while disbursement was to the tune of Rs 3,605 crore as of July 4.

It is followed by Tamil Nadu, with sanction of Rs 6,616 crore loans and disbursements of Rs 3,871 crore.

On May 21, the Cabinet approved additional funding of up to Rs 3 lakh crore at a concessional rate of 9.25 per cent through ECLGS for MSME sector.

Under the scheme, 100 per cent guarantee coverage will be provided by the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company (NCGTC) for additional funding of up to Rs 3 lakh crore to eligible MSMEs and interested Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA) borrowers in the form of a guaranteed emergency credit line (GECL) facility.

For this purpose, a corpus of Rs 41,600 crore was set up by the government, spread over the current and next three financial years.

The scheme will be applicable to all loans sanctioned under GECL facility during the period from the date of announcement of the scheme to October 31 or till the amount of Rs 3 lakh crore is sanctioned under GECL, whichever is earlier.

All MSME borrower accounts with an outstanding credit of up to Rs 25 crore as on February 29, which were less than or equal to 60 days past due as on that date, i.e., regular, SMA-0 and SMA-1 accounts, and with an annual turnover of up to Rs 100 crore are eligible for GECL funding under the scheme."

Five public sector banks (PSBs) — State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of India (BOI), Punjab National Bank (PNB), Canara Bank and Bank of Baroda (BoB) — have at least Rs 7.9 lakh crore worth of loans under moratorium.

This amount, which is nearly 20 percent of all local advances, includes loans that were stressed even before the coronavirus pandemic affected the economy, Mint reported.

The amount, however, is not absolute. Only SBI, which is shouldering the bulk moratorium amount of Rs 5.63 lakh crore, has included pre- and post-COVID-19 cases. The other four have given out numbers only for pre-COVID-19 deferments, it said.

Further, since there are no standard disclosure norms for loans under a moratorium, each bank has chosen their own metric for calculation and may not necessarily reflect the COVID-19 impact on loan repayment capabilities, the report noted.

Some have chosen to reveal the percentage of loan book under a moratorium, and others the percentage of borrowers who opted for a moratorium.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

The five PBSs also revealed Rs 19,182 crore worth of loans are under special mention account (SMA-2) and the borrowers who benefited from the standstill in asset classification.

Loans are categorised as “stressed” even when the repayment is delayed by only a day. SMA-2 loans are those loan repayments which are delayed by 61-90 days.

Lenders are likely waiting till the moratorium period ends for clarity on data, analysts told the paper. They also believe that the situation has improved from mid-May levels.

SBI's economists, on June 29, said the surge in equity markets was not linked to economic recovery and may be a sign of irrational exuberance. Adding to it, they also pitch for a second round of fiscal support to help the impacted sectors.

They also warned that banks will start reporting higher non-performing assets (NPAs) after September, once the six-month moratorium on loan repayment ends.

The markets shed over a fifth of their value in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic and have recouped some of the losses in the last few weeks. Interestingly, the gains happened even as the chorus of a contraction in GDP started among the analysts, wherein some expect a negative growth of up to 5 per cent in 2020-21.

There is a weak linkage between buoyant markets and economic recovery and the phenomenon largely reflects “irrational exuberance”, the economists wrote in a note, attributing the same to easy liquidity made available by RBI.

“Beautiful markets do not signify a beautiful economy,” they said.

They also seemed to suggest that India cannot rely a lot on agriculture to boost the overall GDP growth, pointing out that even if the farm sector's historically best performance of 15.6 per cent growth in 1951-52 were to be considered, a similar performance can only help the GDP growth by 2 percentage points.

“We must think of a second round of fiscal support at least for the beleaguered sectors,” the note said.

It can be noted that the government has already announced a Rs 20 lakh crore package, but the actual fiscal expenditure will be just a tenth of the package.

The note said deposits in bank accounts are fast outpacing borrowings at present, and added that a large part of Indian population depends on interest from deposits because of the lack of a social security base in the country.

There is an interesting shift in possible consumer behaviour during lockdown that could have wider positive ramifications for the India banking system, it said, adding that transactions per credit or debit cards have declined and it is also possible that the purchases have shifted to daily essentials from luxury items.

Per card transactions have declined from as high as Rs 12,000 to Rs 3,600 in the case of credit cards and Rs 1,000 to Rs 350 in the case of debit cards, it said.

“Now the question is how much of this consumer deleveraging in April is because of lockdown/lack of business and how much is because of consumers actually maintaining a discipline in consumer behaviour,” it said, adding that this will influence the volumes of NPAs for banks going forward.

It also noted that households have started to use the gold for borrowings lately, and the percentage of secured loans for banks may go up as a result of this trend.

HDFC Bank Managing Director Aditya Puri took home a total remuneration of Rs 18.9 crore in the fiscal year 2019-20, according to the latest annual report released by the bank. This figure is around 38 percent higher than what the bank offered Puri in the previous financial year, which is Rs 13.7 crore.

Puri’s remuneration of Rs 18.9 crore is excluding the value of the stock options exercised during the year which is about Rs 161 crore. This is including the stock options granted and vested over several previous years, but exercised during FY19, the report showed. The remuneration includes value of perquisites worth Rs 2.1 crore.

Kaizad Bharucha, the executive director of HDFC Bank, earned a total of Rs 8.6 crore in FY20 compared with Rs 5.8 crore in FY19, or an increase of 48 percent. Bharucha’s compensation includes Rs 80 lakh of worth of perquisites while it excludes Rs 31.6 crore worth stock options exercised in FY19. In other words, HDFC Bank paid a total of Rs 27.5 crore to two of its top executives in FY19.

Independent directors remuneration

Among HDFC Bank’s independent directors, former RBI deputy governor Shyamala Gopinath earned Rs 64 lakh in FY20, which includes Rs 29 lakh of sitting fees. Gopinath earned the highest remuneration among all independent directors. Malay Patel drew the second highest among independent directors at Rs 43.5 lakh, followed by Umesh Chandra Sarangi (Rs 31 lakh), Sanjiv Sachar (Rs 33 lakh), Sandeep Parekh (Rs 31 lakh) and M D Ranganath (Rs 36.5 lakh).

How much SBI executives earned?

Rajnish Kumar, the chairman of India’s largest bank, State Bank of India (SBI) earned Rs 31.2 lakh in 2019-20, which includes a basic salary of Rs 27 lakh and DA of Rs 4.2 lakh, according to the bank’s latest annual report. Among the managing directors (MDs) of SBI, Parveen Kumar Gupta drew Rs 41.3 lakh in FY20 (of which Rs 11 lakh was leave encashment paid) and Dinesh Kumar Khara earned Rs 29.4 lakh. Arijit Basu, another MD, drew Rs 28.5 lakh.

The wage disparity between the public and the private sectors, however, is not limited to banks. The government has not acted to reform the pay structure so far except for a few tweaks. There is another view that pay reform alone doesn’t make sense unless a level playing field is granted to all banks.

""There is no point in comparing the salaries of private and public sector bankers for obvious reasons. This difference is visible across industries, not just banking,"" said a former PSB chairman on condition of anonymity.

In August 2016, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan called attention to the issue when he said salaries of top level employees of the public sector, including RBI, are way short of global standards.

""One of the problems, of course, is that the public sector overpays at the bottom but underpays at the top. I also feel underpaid,"" Rajan said.

The debate on the relatively lower pay scales of PSB officials was revived recently when the SBI chairman jokingly made a comment on the issue. In a recent conference call with analysts, Kumar was asked if his bank would undertake a pay cut for employees. Pat came Kumar’s reply: ""Road pe aake rehna padega, pehle hi itni kam milti hai (I'll have to live on road, I already get so less).”"

The country's largest lender by assets, State Bank of India (SBI), has written off loans worth Rs 1.79 lakh crore in the last four years, of which Rs 52,387 crore was written off in FY20 alone, data published in SBI’s annual report 2019-20 shows.

A loan is written off when the bank finds the account non-recoverable through normal operations. Such accounts need to be fully provided for. Provisions refer to the amount lenders need to set aside under RBI norms to cover problematic loans. The bank did write-offs worth Rs 58,905 crore in FY19 and Rs 40,196 crore in FY18.

“The write-offs happen every year wherever the bank doesn't find any scope to recover certain loans. In the current economic scenario, this trend is not surprising,” said a banking industry official on condition of anonymity.

Recoveries from technical write-offs improve

SBI recovered Rs 9,250 crore from the Advance Under Collection Account (AUCA) in FY20 as against Rs 8,345 crore in FY19, the bank said in its 2019-20 annual report. AUCA refers to chronic bad debt cases where recovery is unlikely in the normal course. The bank moves such accounts to AUCA, known as technical write-offs, although recovery efforts will continue. The improvement in recoveries in AUCA augurs well for the bank. In FY18, SBI had recovered only Rs 5,333 crore from AUCA and Rs3963 crore in FY17.

“AUCA absorbs a loan account only when the respective departments find recovery nearly impossible in the normal course. Hence, these are kind of technically written-off loans. But, this doesn’t mean that the money is gone since recovery attempts will continue,” said the official quoted earlier.

In general, SBI expects a big spike in non-performing assets (NPAs) in the fiscal year 2021 against the backdrop of COVID-19 and is taking preemptive measures to avoid bad loan spike, the bank said in the annual report. “A large spurt in NPA Level during FY2021 was anticipated under the backdrop of COVID-19. To counter this, your Bank is taking several pre-emptive measures in extending assistance to its borrowers, so that they can face the current challenges and continue as performing assets,” SBI said.

Bad loan threat looms

As at March-end, SBI has gross NPAs of 6.15 percent as compared with 7.5 percent in the year-ago period. Net NPAs improved to 2.23 percent from 3.01 percent in the year-ago period. In absolute terms, Gross NPAs declined to Rs1.49 lakh crore from Rs 1.72 lakh crore in the year-ago period.

To tackle NPA cases more efficiently, the bank has constituted a special vertical called stressed assets resolution group (SARG), which will focus on resolution of NPAs with a sector-specific approach. The vertical is headed by managing director, supported by deputy managing director, and three chief general managers overseeing the sector-wise portfolio.

The account management teams function under the guidance of seven general managers. ""As on March 2020, SARG has 19 Stressed Assets Management Branches (SAMBs) and 53 Stressed Assets Recovery Branches (SARBs) across the country, covering 61.26 percent and 86.03 percent of your Bank’s NPAs and AUCA, respectively,"" the bank said in the annual report.

The banking sector is likely to witness a major spike in NPAs going ahead on account of the impact of COVID-19 on industries, which will in turn impact the cash flows of companies and make recovery process difficult.

NCLT comes in handy

A significant portion of the recovery at SARG came through the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) route, SBI said. The vertical also implements special one-time settlement schemes from time to time. A team has been set up to look after the sale of Assets to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) on Cash and/or Security Receipts basis, the bank said. Banks sell bad assets to ARCs at a discount to take the burden off the balance sheet. ARCs attempts to resolve those accounts and sell to potential buyers.

According to SBI, a total of 821 cases were referred to the NCLT as on March 31, 2020, out of which 662 cases have been admitted. SBI has recovered an amount of Rs 12,024 crore in the account of a single big borrower through the NCLT process. Also, 82 cases have been resolved, including some high-value accounts from the RBI’s reference lists, the report said.

Further, SBI has constituted a Special Situation Team of experts in credit monitoring and resolution at SARG for the accounts of Rs 500 crore and above in SMA2 (accounts where payments are overdue past 60 days), SBI said, adding this helps in monitoring and putting in place resolution plan from the very beginning of default and to take proactive resolution measures at an early stage of default.

“Today, SARG stands as one of the most important verticals of your Bank and the GNPA of your Bank is on course of a downward journey. Resolution of stressed assets by SARG presents the following latent income generating avenues for your bank,” SBI said in the annual report. Besides, SARG has introduced methods such as arranging mega e-auction of a large number of properties on a pan-India basis and identification of un-encumbered properties of borrowers and guarantors.

According to analysts, the bad loan situation is likely to worsen going ahead. “The real impact will be known when the moratorium period gets over by August 31. Till then banks cannot understand the actual impact of COVID-19 on asset quality,” said Siddharth Purohit, analyst at SMC Global securities."

State Bank of India (SBI), India’s largest lender, has increased its foreign offices to 233 as on March, 2020 from 208 a year ago. It opened 32 new offices and closed seven, the bank said in its 2019-20 annual report.

The lender now has 58 overseas branches and sub-offices, 163 offices of subsidiaries, seven representative offices, five joint ventures/associates.

The offices operate under nine subsidiaries, a majority of which are owned by the bank. The nine subsidiaries include State Bank of India California, which is a 100 percent subsidiary, SBI Canada (100 percent), SBI UK (100 percent), Commercial Indo Bank LLC (100 percent), SBI Mauritius Ltd (96.6 percent), Bank SBI Indonesia (99 percent), Bank SBI Botswana (100 percent), Nepal SBI Bank (55 percent). SBI also has a foreign non-banking subsidiary, SBI Servicos Limitada, Brazil, and a joint venture, Bank of Bhutan.

SBI’s overseas operations include trade finance and funding the capital needs of India-based companies. This includes helping Indian corporates in their growth strategy, including green-field ventures, by arranging debt in foreign currency by way of external commercial borrowings through syndicated deals in conjunction with other Indian and foreign banks, and through bilateral arrangements.

In FY20, SBI closed four branches--Nassau (Bahamas), Paris (France), Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) and Tianjin (China). It merged two branches-- Gulshan with Dhaka, Bangladesh, and Verdun Road with Little India in Singapore.

The lender also started a sub-office in Melbourne to increase share in remittance and Trade Finance Business, a representative office in Paris and an extension counter at Motijheel in Bangladesh.

SBI also opened six India visa application centres in Bangladesh at Thakurgaon, Brahmanbaria, Comilla, Sathkira, Bogura and Naokhali. Nepal SBI Bank Limited, a subsidiary of SBI opened 22 offices. In total, nine foreign offices of SBI and 23 offices of overseas subsidiaries have been added during the FY2020.

SBI’s launched its foreign operations with Bank of Madras in Colombo, Sri Lanka in July 1864, a first for Indian banks.

According to the annual report, the bank sanctioned foreign currency loans to the tune of $ 9.2 billion to Indian-related corporates and $ 11.35 billion loans to overseas entities.

The trade finance business now contributes around 27 percent in the IBG advances portfolio and contributes around 12 percent to Non-interest income. SBI has a separate Business Unit – International Banking Group (IBG) headed by a managing director and supported by the deputy managing director for its overseas operations."

Post the novel coronavirus pandemic, the inequality gap in the country will narrow down, as income of rich states is likely to decline more than the poor states, according to an SBI research report — Ecowrap.

At all India level, per capita income (PCI), which is a measure of the earnings per person in a nation or geographic region, will decline by 5.4 percent in FY21 to Rs 1.43 lakh, the report said.

“We expect that the inequality gap in India will narrow down post-COVID pandemic as decline in income of rich states will be much greater than the decline in income of poor states,” the State Bank of India (SBI)'s research report said.

A similar type of experience of decline in inequality was witnessed in Germany after the collapse of the Berlin war (1989), it said.

The report said this decline in PCI is higher than the nominal GDP decline of 3.8 percent.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Globally also, the fall in per capita GDP of 6.2 percent in 2020 is significantly greater than the 5.2 percent decline in the world GDP.

The rich states (whose per capita income is greater than all India average) will be most affected in per capita income terms.

“In Delhi (-15.4 per cent) and Chandigarh (-13.9 per cent), the decline in PCI is almost thrice than the decline at all India levels (-5.4 per cent),” it said.

A total of eight states and Union Territories are supposed to witness a decline in PCI in double digits in FY21 and that is most alarming, the report said. These states constitute as much as 47 percent of the country's GDP.

“This is due to the fact that these are the urban areas (and red zones also) where lockdown was implemented most severely. The closure of markets, shopping complexes and malls adversely affected income of these areas,” it said.

Even after opening of markets (in staggered manner), the number of customers is still 70-80 percent less than the normal times, the report said.

In the current fiscal, states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu are expected to witness a decline of 10-12 percent in PCI.

However, in the relatively less well off states like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha (where per capita income is below the national average) the decline in PCI is less than 8 percent, the report said.

“The possible reasons are a larger number of green zones, prominence of agricultural activity and already low levels of income,” it added.

The report projects a GDP decline of 6.8 per cent for FY21.

“We believe that the country will clearly have a 'statistical V-shaped recovery / Swoosh' in FY22 primarily due to the favourable base effect,” it said.

Beyond such base effect, it would, however, take at least till FY24, if the country replicates the best case example in history, if not more before it gets back to the pre-pandemic level growth rate, the report noted."

State Bank of India (SBI) has mobilised 13,212 kg of household and institutional gold through the Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS), according to the state-owned bank's annual report.

It added that the country's largest lender collected as much as 3,973 kg of gold during 2019-20 under the GMS, a programme launched by the government to utilise gold lying idle with individuals as well as trusts.

""During FY2020, (the) bank mobilised gold amounting to 3,973 kgs, bringing the cumulative mobilisation to 13,212 kgs,"" said SBI in the report.

The government launched the GMS in November 2015 to mobilise idle gold held by households and institutions. The objective of the scheme was to facilitate use of idle gold for productive purposes, and also reduce the country's dependence on imports.

The bank further said that during 2019-20, it mobilised 647 kg (Rs 243.91 crore) through sovereign gold bonds (SGB), thus taking the total gold mobilised since inception of the scheme to 5,098 kg (Rs 1,561 crore).

The SGB scheme was introduced by the government during 2015-16 to promote digital gold instead of physical gold for investment purposes.

As a primary player in the field of bullion banking, the bank has been making available metal gold loan to jewellers engaged in manufacturing of gold ornaments for the domestic and export purposes.

During 2019-20, the bank extended metal gold loan to jewellers to the extent of 22,255 kg and sold 2,522 kg of gold under the 'Sale of Gold' scheme to jewellers and traders."

Fitch Ratings on June 22 revised the outlook on State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and six other banks to Negative from Stable in line with rating changes to India's sovereign outlook due to the coronavirus impact.

The rating agency revised the outlook for Export-Import Bank of India (EXIM), SBI, Bank of Baroda, Bank of Baroda (New Zealand), Bank of India, Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank while affirming their ratings.

At the same time, Fitch has affirmed IDBI Bank (IDBI) rating, while maintaining the outlook at negative.

""The rating actions follow Fitch's revision of the outlook on the 'BBB-' rating on India to negative from stable on June 18, 2020, due to the impact of the escalating coronavirus pandemic on India's economy,"" it said in a statement.

Fitch said the ratings of all the nine Indian banks are support-driven and anchored to their respective sovereign country rating. ""They are based on Fitch's assessment of high to moderate probability of extraordinary state support for these banks, which takes into account our assessment of the sovereign's ability and propensity to provide extraordinary support.""

The negative outlook on India's sovereign rating, it said, reflects an increasing strain on the state's ability to provide extraordinary support, due to the sovereign's limited fiscal space and the significant deterioration in fiscal metrics due to challenges from COVID-19 pandemic.

""The rating action does not affect the banks' Viability Ratings (VRs),"" it said. ""EXIM does not have a VR as its role as a policy bank makes an assessment of its standalone credit profile less meaningful.""

While EXIM is of high strategic and systemic importance due to its unique policy role, SBI is the largest Indian bank with nearly 25 per cent market share in system assets and deposits.

SBI is 57.9 per cent state-owned and has a much broader policy role than peers.

""SBI is highly likely to receive extraordinary state support, if required, due to its very high systemic importance,"" it said.

For ICICI and AXIS Bank, Fitch said it expects a moderate probability of extraordinary state support for these banks, due to their systemic importance, market position and private ownership.

""The probability of extraordinary state support for the two large private banks will be lower than for large state banks, which are likely to have priority due to the sovereign's constrained finances,"" the agency said.

The other banks whose outlook was lowered too have ""high systemic importance"" stemming from their significant market share, majority government ownership and role in policy lending.

On keeping outlook unchanged for IDBI, it said this reflects expectation that the state's propensity to provide extraordinary support to IDBI may diminish following the government's proposal to sell its stake in the bank and dispose of part of its stake in the lender's majority shareholder, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).

In a letter to the bank's shareholders, Kumar exuded confidence that despite economic headwinds, the robust performance achieved by the country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) in 2019-20 will continue in the current financial year.

""…despite the economic headwinds, the Bank is well prepared to adjust to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. I am more than hopeful that the robust performance achieved in FY20 will continue in FY21 as well,"" the SBI chairman said.

Observing that the full impact of COVID-19 outbreak will be felt in the current financial year, Kumar said from the bank's point of view, the true impact of COVID pandemic must also consider the behavioural impact on bank's customers, and composition of the portfolio, among others.

""For instance, likely job cuts and salary reductions will have relatively low level of stress on account of higher proportion of Govt/ Quasi Govt. sector customers,"" he said in the letter, as per SBI's annual report.

""As of now, only 21.8 per cent of the customers have availed the benefit of moratorium. Furthermore, the Bank was able to achieve 98 per cent branch operability as well as 91 per cent alternate channel operability during the period of lockdown,"" Kumar added.

Nevertheless, an elaborate Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is in place to manage disruptions, he said.

SBI has traditionally been the banker of choice to the Government of India (GOI) and is an accredited banker to major Central Government Ministries and Departments, the annual report said.

It said SBI is contributing significantly towards e-governance initiatives taken by the GOI, and is instrumental in the development of e-solutions for both Central and state governments.

""This has facilitated their transition to the online mode, providing greater efficiency and transparency, resulting in ease of doing business and relaxation of living for the citizens,"" it said.

SBI's total government business turnover was Rs 52,62,643 crore during fiscal 2019-20.

The bank registered its highest ever yearly net profit in 2019-20 at Rs 14,488 crore. The net profit was Rs 862 crore during 2018-19.

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the outlook of the global economy has become very uncertain and world is likely to experience a deep rooted recession next year, Kumar said.

The RBI expects contraction in the Indian economy during the current financial year.

Kumar also said that the pandemic has changed the preference of customers and it is a big opportunity for the bank as there is now more acceptability to adopt digital channels for doing banking transactions.

He said the bank will further scale up YONO (all-encompassing digital platform) and has set a target of doubling user registrations in the next six months, and further strengthen platform through new product offerings like end-to-end home loans, pre-approved car loan and personal gold loans."

Small-ticket government scheme loans have a higher number of bad loans than corporate loans, State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar said,

Speaking at the Bharat Chamber of Commerce’s e-session on the banking system, he said corporate bad loans are now ""under control"", Business Standard reported.

“NPAs in Kisan Credit Card (KCC) loans are at par with Mudra loans. In Mudra loans, the gross NPA was close to 15 percent. However, with a new digital model in place, NPAs stood at close to 10 per cent,"" he pointed out.

Singh also spoke about loan moratoriums, noting that enthusiasm for the scheme was subdued as borrowers feared ""cost implications"" and ""increased liability"" at this point of time.

Commenting on loans disbursed to medium, small and micro enterprises (MSMEs), Singh said SBI has over the past 15 days disbursed 60 percent of the loans sanctioned to 2 lakh MSMEs, adding: “Our data analysis shows that MSMEs are managing this crisis very well.”

State Bank of India on Tuesday said it has disbursed Rs 8,700 crore under the Rs 3-lakh crore Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) for the MSME sector, pummelled by the coronavirus-induced lockdown.

As per the directions of the finance ministry, SBI and other banks rolled out the Guaranteed Emergency Credit Line (GECL) loan product to support MSMEs and business enterprises as per the guidelines of NCGTC.

ECLGS is the biggest fiscal component of the mega Rs 20-lakh crore package announced last month.

Under the scheme, 100 per cent guarantee coverage is being provided by the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company (NCGTC) for additional funding of up to Rs 3 lakh crore to eligible MSMEs and interested MUDRA borrowers in the form of a GECL facility.

""The bank has sanctioned GECL aggregating Rs 15,000 crore to 1.5 lakh MSME customers. SBI so far has disbursed loans worth Rs 8,700 crore,"" SBI said in a statement.

Additional supportive measures such as COVID Emergency Credit Line, re-assessment of working capital limits, and restructuring of advances are also being made available to MSME customers, it said.

""MSMEs formed a very crucial part of the announcements made under the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan' by the Government of India wherein MSMEs were defined. To empower them in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, SBI organized more than 125 E-Town Hall Meetings from May to date,"" it said.

As per directives of the Department of Financial Services, it said, SBI conducted Circle level meetings to reach out to MSME customers and explain the various relief and financial support measures provided to them to fight the COVID-19 outbreak.

The main objective of the scheme is to provide an incentive to member lending institutions to increase access and enable availability of additional funding facility to MSME borrowers, in view of the economic distress caused by the COVID-19 crisis.

The scheme gives the lenders 100 per cent guarantee for any losses suffered by them due to non-repayment of the GECL funding by borrowers.

All MSME borrower accounts with an outstanding credit of up to Rs 25 crore as on February 29, which were less than or equal to 60 days past due as on that date, and with an annual turnover of up to Rs 100 crore, would be eligible for GECL funding under the scheme."

A job advertisement by country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has caught everyone's attention. It has also revived an old debate of relatively low pay of public sector bank employees.

According to the advertisement posted on its website, SBI said it will offer Rs 75 lakh to 1 crore as annual compensation for the role of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) on a three-year contract.

Now compare this with SBI Chairman's remuneration. According to SBI’s annual report, Rajnish Kumar received less than Rs 30 lakh in FY 19. To be precise, Kumar's annual compensation was Rs 29.5 lakh for FY19. As compared with this, HDFC Bank's CEO got an annual compensation of Rs55 crore. Other private, foreign bank CEOs too get comparable high annual package.

For long, the huge difference between compensation levels of public sector bank employees and their private sector counterparts has been a matter of debate in banking industry. Poor pay has been cited as the prime reason for exodus of talent from public sector to private entities. This also affects the morale of bankers in a highly competitive banking sector.

Public sector employee unions have been highlighting the disparity in pay levels for several years. Presently, the compensation of public sector bank executives are decided through negotiations between Indian Banks Association (the industry lobby of banks) and trade union representatives once in five years.

Recently, a comment by SBI chairman had caught public attention. In a conference call with analysts, Kumar was asked if the SBI would cut pay for employees. The SBI Chairman replied saying ""road pe aake rehna padega, pehle hi itni kam milti hai (I'll have to live on road, I already get so less)"". Although this was said jokingly, the comment was a reference to the relatively low pay of PSU bankers.

The CFO post in SBI turned vacant after Prashant Kumar resigned to head Yes Bank. According to the advertisement, the CFO candidate must be a chartered accountant with minimum 15 years of experience in managing accounts and taxation with large institutions out of which ten years should be with a bank/financial institution.

SBI has also announced the opening for a data protection officer. Compensation will not be a limiting factor for suitable candidate, the bank said."

""SBI would like to clarify that it is not conducting its Annual General Meeting on the said date,"" SBI said in a statement.

The bank in a filing to exchanges in the shareholders meetings section has mentioned that the June 17 meeting is an extraordinary general meeting (EGM).

The bank said the shareholders will be allowed to e-vote for electing four directors from a list of five candidates as per the provisions of the SBI Act and SBI General Regulations, 1955.

Here are the highlights of SBI's Q4 FY20 earnings call compiled by Narnolia Financial Advisors:

The banks believes its strong liability franchise, consistent operating income and core PPOP, diversified loan portfolio, also healthy capital adequacy ratio and leading digital capabilities will help it face the challenges caused due to COVID 19.

The total working capital loans for the banks are Rs 9 lakh crore out of which around 20% have taken the moratorium.

Bank has offered the moratorium to all the customers and will continue to do in second phase of moratorium.

NIM is not expected to improve any further and could remain in current range.

The yield was affected by the interest reversals on AGRI Slippages. The Agri slippages interest reversal was around 20%.

The agri slippage during the year are expected to be less as agriculture segment is expected to be less impacted by COVID 19.

The other income is expected to be impacted during the year due to the pressure on FOREX income and recoveries but it could be compensated through NII growth.

In Housing segment loan, the bank is not much worried as 92% of the customers live in those homes thus higher recovery rate is expected.

Management feels they need not to raise capital in near terms as its capital adequacy is healthy at the current situation."

State Bank of India (SBI) share price was up 3 percent in the morning trade on June 5 ahead of the bank's Q4 results.

The stock is one of the top index gainers and is also one of the most active stocks on NSE in terms of volumes.

The scrip has jumped over 17 percent in the last 15 days and was quoting at Rs 180.80, up Rs 6.75, or 3.88 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 180.85 and an intraday low of Rs 176.00.

The country's largest lender is likely to report healthy growth in March quarter profit, boosted by stake sale in SBI Cards through IPO, recovery from some NPA accounts and lower tax cost.

According to brokerages, the profit growth could be in the range of 600-1,000 percent in Q4 compared to same period last year, while net interest income is likely to be in double digits (YoY) but lower than normal due to moderate growth in advances and steady net interest margin.

According to HDFC Securities, profit is expected to grow 10 percent QoQ, partially aided by the lower tax rate (opted for new tax regime in Q3). ""On a YoY basis, PAT is expected to grow 7.3x (on smaller base). NII may grow 12 percent YoY and loan growth is expected to moderate to around 3 percent YoY (7 percent in Q3).""

Provisions are expected to be lower due to recovery though there could be some COVID-19 impact, while asset quality is likely to be stable though slippages may remain elevated a bit.

""We expect a volatile performance due to recovery in NPLs (Alok Industries and a few smaller ones) as the accounting treatment is likely to be different for each recovery. Loan growth will be subdued at around 7 percent YoY and NIM (core) unchanged QoQ at around 2.9 percent. Reported NIM would have one-off from NPL recovery. Treasury income will include gains on account of stake sale in SBI Cards,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees 1,007 percent YoY growth in profit and 13.5 percent rise in net interest income in Q4.

State Bank of India plans to raise upto USD 1.5 billion to in fiscal year 2020-21, the bank said in a notification to Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on June 4. The executive committee of the central board will meet on June 11 to consider the proposal of ""long-term fund raising in single/multiple tranches through a public offer and/or private placement of senior unsecured notes in US dollar or any other convertible currency during FY20-21"", the bank said.

A staggering 1.3 billion UPI transactions originated from SBI in the first four months of 2020. Origination means customers have used an SBI bank account to make these payments. The payment may have been done through the SBI app or any other third party app like Google Pay.

In the same four months, Axis Bank originated close to 450 million transactions, followed by HDFC Bank (427 million), Paytm Payments Bank (386 million) and ICICI Bank (340 million).

SBI recorded 350 million transactions in February, the highest in the last four months. In January it carried out 347 million transactions. In March, this fell slightly to 338 million. In April, this slipped to 298 million transactions, when the entire country was under a strict lockdown due to the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic.

UPI is an interbank digital payments mechanism which allows consumers to make payments through smartphones, either by transferring money to another UPI ID or by scanning QR codes. Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI, Yes Bank, HDFC Bank and Paytm Payments Bank are the largest banks in this space, data shows. In May, UPI recorded 1.2 billion transactions supporting the transfer of Rs 2.2 lakh crore.

“UPI has ensured that any bank account holder can easily participate in digital payments, irrespective of that bank’s digital capabilities. Third-party UPI apps have made payments both inter-person and merchant payments seamless using a bank account of the customer’s choice,” said Deepak Abbott, who was previously a Senior Vice-President at Paytm.

While Yes Bank has been one of the major players in UPI, it has mostly seen transactions coming into its bank accounts. That means consumers have paid Yes Bank account holders.

“This has happened because they have acquired merchants for digital payments very aggressively who would have received these transactions. Historically, Yes Bank has been one of the leaders in merchant payments on UPI,” said a senior banker on the condition of anonymity.

Yes Bank recorded more than 573 million such transactions. A bulk of this could be merchant payments. NPCI did not offer any separate distinction between merchant transactions and person-to-person transactions.

Among popular third-party payment apps Google Pay, Paytm and PhonePe are the major competitors vying for a share of the UPI payments pie. Facebook-owned WhatsApp Payments is also set to go live on UPI soon. It all depends on the instant messaging app submitting data localisation plans for NPCI and Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) consideration.

NPCI data showed that in terms of transaction success rates, Axis Bank has shown highest success rate in April at 96 percent, followed by ICICI Bank around 95 percent. Banks consistently have shown upwards of 90 percent transaction success rates."

India needs to implement an intelligent lockdown exit strategy to prevent irreversible growth collapse, SBI said in a research report on Saturday.

India's economic growth slipped to an 11-year low of 4.2 percent in 2019-20 and to 3.1 percent in January-March, the lowest in the last 40 quarters.

The nation-wide lockdown to prevent spread of coronavirus with effect from March 25 has hit economic activities. The fourth phase of the lockdown is set to expire on Sunday.

""We now believe that we should implement an intelligent lockdown exit strategy as the discussion has moved from debate between lives and livelihood to also between lives and lives as an elongated lockdown will only prolong irreversible growth collapse,"" SBI's research report 'Ecowrap' said.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Going by past experience, recovery from recession often tends to be slow and takes five to ten years to reach the former peak levels of economic activity, it said.

Commenting on the GDP data released on Friday, the report said loss of economic activity due to the lockdown in the last few days of March has dragged GDP growth to a 40-quarter low of 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019-20.

With this, the full year 2019-20 GDP growth comes to 4.2 percent (11-year low) compared to 6.1 percent in the preceding financial year.

In terms of sectors, the only silver lining was agriculture, it said.

'Agriculture and allied activities' grew at 4 percent in the fiscal ended March 2020, compared to the year-ago growth of 2.4 percent.

However, the Central Statistical Office (CSO) has significantly revised the previous quarters' growth rates (compared to third quarter release) which is ""quite puzzling and raises questions about data quality and remarkable volatility in the new series and we believe that a methodological note from CSO explaining the frequent revisions will be very useful"", it added.

In fact, in February the quarterly numbers underwent significant upward revisions and such numbers have now been steeply revised downwards by an almost equal amount, within a span of three months, the report said.

While it is customary to change the quarterly numbers in May when the third estimate is released, the extent of such revision shows that the loss in fourth quarter because of the lockdown may have possibly been evenly distributed across quarters, that is Rs 1.18 lakh crore loss estimated and distributed across quarters in 2019-20, it said.

""On an unchanged Q1, Q2 and Q3 numbers, the Q4 growth comes at 1.2 percent. As per our calculation only 18 percent of GVA is exempted from the lockdown and CSO may release data for that segment only for a large part of Q1FY21, and hence we cannot rule out data issues even for Q1,"" the report said.

""We would like CSO to come out with a methodological note"" explaining the reasons of why the data has become so volatile in last two-three years, it added.

""Is it because the economy is undergoing a structural change that CSO is not able to capture? These are questions that CSO can only provide an answer,"" it said.

The report noted that as the government has extended statutory timelines for submitting the requisite financial returns, these estimates are thus based on whatever data is available.

It expects significant revisions in both quarterly as well as annual numbers in August when the data on first quarter of the current fiscal would be released.

But all are dogged by the same question in this fourth attempt to revive the airline - will anyone reach the finishing line?

The airline's lenders too are in a wait-and-watch mode, before pinning their hopes on the latest suitors.

The airline had suspended operations in April 2019, after running out of money to run operations.

Some of the new names that Moneycontrol could verify till now include - Hyderabad's Turbo Aviation, which specialises in charter, ground handling and MRO services; and entrepreneur Sanjay Mandavia of FSTC, who had planned to start a new airline in India, this year.

And yes, there is an airline!

Alpha Airways, which advisory firm CAPA says is based in Kyrgyzstan. A Google search doesn't throw up any website.

Making a comeback

Three suitors have made a comeback. One is AdiGro Aviation, the London-based group headed by Sanjay Viswanathan. After being in the race for a considerable amount of time, and teaming-up with another suitor - a consortium of Jet Airways employees - AdiGro had bowed out.

Confirming the re-interest, Viswanathan, who is the Chairman of AdiGro, told Moneycontrol: ""AdiGro is happy to work collaboratively with Resolution Professional, Committee of Creditors and Ministry of Civil Aviation to revive it, if this happens. It's in this spirit that we submitted our Prelim Resolution Plan.""

Interestingly, the consortium of Jet Airways employees has also made a comeback.

The third one is Atmosphere Intercontinental Airlines, led by Jason Unsworth, the British entrepreneur whose offer last year to take control of Jet Airways had evoked surprise.

South America's Synergy Group, which is probably to have come closest to the finishing line since Jet Airways insolvency process began last year, continues to be in the race.

More new suitors

One of them is KALROCK Capital, a UK-based financial services firm which, among other things, specialises in 'special situations'.

Its Board Member Manoj Narender Madnani confirmed that KALROCK has submitted an EoI for Jet Airways.

""Jet is a premium brand and we would like to be part of the solution, this will bring jobs back in an essential sector,"" he told Moneycontrol.

Explaining the rationale behind the firm's interest, Madnani added, ""Our investment thesis is predicated on our ability to marry efficient and sustainable technologies to the aviation sector and improve efficiencies.

""With the global supply chains looking at India, we believe that the Indian aviation market is poised to grow exponentially once international skies open.""

The shortlist

""The long list of suitors is surprising, given the state of the aviation sector because of COVID-19. In the past, many of the suitors hadn't even presented the relevant documents. Let's see if it's different this time,"" said a senior executive from the industry.

The resolution professional, added sources, will now shortlist the suitors to create a provisional list of EoIs and this will be presented to the banks. Lenders, led by State Bank of India, have an exposure of over Rs 8,000 crore to Jet Airways.

Overall, claims of about Rs 30,000 crore have been made on the airline.

The shortlist will be made within a week, added an executive.

Banks not too hopeful

Bankers to Jet Airways are not too sure of a successful outcome even this time. A top official in State Bank of India said the banks are on a wait and watch mode. It is early to predict in which way the bidding process will progress this time, the official said.

""People are bidding, which means there is some interest. If you see, all airlines are in difficult [circumstances] this time. When bidding, they would have thought about all this. Let's see how it goes this time,"" said the SBI official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Other lenders include Bank of India, Canara Bank, IDBI, Indian Overseas Bank and Punjab National Bank. Aviation is one of the high stress sectors for banks even before the lockdown.

""There is nothing much left (in Jet Airways) anyway. If somebody can run it, we would be happy,"" said the official.

Jet is not the first airline where banks, mainly PSU lenders, were left with holding the baby.

Banks have lost (or yet to recover) at least Rs 10,000 crore (including accrued interest amount) to Vijay Mallya-owed Kingfisher Airlines.

Mallya is close to being deported back to the country post a recent court verdict in the UK. But, even if he is brought back to India, there is no assurance that banks will get their money back in the foreseeable future."

After RBI slashed the repo rate by 40 bps to 4 percent on May 22, State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar said the steps taken by the central bank will help in quick revival of the economy.

The central bank extended the moratorium period for the repayment of loans by another three months till August 31, 2020, and also increased bank exposure to corporates to 30 percent of the group's net worth from the current limit of 25 percent.

""The entire effort of the government and the RBI is to revive the growth in the economy and at the same time recognising the difficulties that industries are facing. All the measures around reduction in repo rate, moratorium and increase in the limit on group exposures will be helpful in revival of the economy,"" Kumar said.

The measures are a calibrated response to the situation which is emerging on account to the disruptions caused due to COVID-19, he said.

Kumar said, so far, 20 percent of the SBI borrowers have opted for the three-month moratorium.

He said the extension of moratorium on repayment of loans will be helpful to the industry.

Also, with the extension of moratorium, there is no urgent need for a dispensation from the RBI.

""Right now, the moratorium will take care of the situation around the cash flow disruptions. I would not be obsessed with one-time restructuring at this particular point of time when we have time till August 31,"" he said.

Kumar, however, said banks can still go for restructuring of stressed accounts, if required, as per the June 7 circular of RBI.

When asked about extending moratorium to NBFCs and housing finance companies, Kumar said that it would be given on a case to case basis.

""We would decide on a case to case basis. We will have to look at their (NBFCs/HFCs) cash flows and take a decision,"" he said.

The registered address is in Sector 17, Rohini in New Delhi. Despite the flashy label, the company has no website. Ramdev makes — used to rather — grain mill products, starches and starch products.

Details are hard to come by, but one can gather from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) website that the company was incorporated on April 5, 2004 with an authorised share capital of Rs 5 crore and paid-up capital of Rs 4.3 crore. The Balance Sheet was last filed on March 31, 2014 and the Annual General Meeting (AGM) last held on September 29, 2014.

To use an analogy drawn from its business, it is a ‘needle in a haystack’ kind of company. But all of a sudden, Ramdev International has been thrust into the limelight because for some mysterious reason, despite its obscurity, the company’s credentials were good enough for six banks, including State Bank of India (SBI) — India’s largest — to lend to the promoters generously six years ago. The Rs 414-crore loan SBI and five other banks offered to Ramdev International for business expansion turned an NPA (non-performing assets) on January 27, 2016.

Not a measly amount, by any stretch of imagination. Yet, SBI and other banks moved the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) with a complaint only early this year--on February 25. That’s four years after the lenders discovered foul play in the account and the conduct of its promoters.

While the story of Ramdev International is emblematic of the ugly banking sector mess, there are eerie parallels with the shenanigans of liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya.

Not only did SBI and the other lenders wait four years to classify the account as fraud, they also moved painfully slow to seek legal action against its promoters— Naresh Kumar, Suresh Kumar and Sangita. When a complaint was finally filed with the CBI against the three, the bankers found they had fled the country around a year ago. To give the bankers the benefit of doubt, banks discovered about their escape a little late. But why did they wait until February to file a complaint?

SBI is yet to respond to a detailed email questionnaire sent by Moneycontrol on May 14 enquiring about the bank’s delay in moving the CBI to report the fraud.

Twist in the taleThe CBI is investigating the Kumars and Sangita for allegedly defrauding the six banks and fudging accounts. Of the Rs 414 crore, SBI lent Rs173 crore to Ramdev International, Canara Bank disbursed Rs 76.09 crore, Union Bank of India Rs 64.31 crore, Central Bank of India Rs 51.31 crore, Corporation Bank Rs 36.91 crore and IDBI Bank Rs 12.27 crore. The CBI noted that all three promoters escaped to safer pastures long before SBI moved the CBI with the complaint of fraud and default.

Bankers that Moneycontrol spoke to said besides rice milling plants, Ramdev also has offices in Saudi Arabia and Dubai for trading business. They did not want to be named.

How the events unfoldedThe Ramdev International account was a typical corporate borrower default case for SBI and other banks until August 2016. Most companies involved in the business of paddy procurement and processing were reporting losses on account of the high procurement cost and low receivables.

A team of lenders decided to swing into action that month, seven months after the account turned NPA. They inspected the company premises.

According to SBI’s complaint to CBI, when the inspection team landed at the factory premises, all that they found was Haryana Police Security Guards roaming the premises. “On enquiry, (we came to know) that the borrowers are absconding and have left the country,"" says the SBI complaint.

The borrowers had removed the entire machinery from the old plant and fudged the Balance Sheet in order to unlawfully gain at the cost of banks' funds. It didn’t take much time for the bankers to realise they were duped.

Remember, this incident happened in 2016. The visit to the premises should have given enough warning bells that something was seriously amiss. But it took another three years, according to the bank’s complaint to CBI, for the lenders to confirm the missing status of the Kumars.

What explains the inordinate delay by SBI and other lenders to report the fraud? Did the delay on the part of banks help the promoters leave the country before investigators could arrest them?

Why did the banks delay action?According to a senior bank executive, banks typically delay reporting fraud even after sufficient evidence to avoid sudden one-time provisions.

“If an account becomes NPA, you need to make partial provisions depending up on the class of the asset. In most cases, this could start from 15 percent. But if the account is reported as fraud, this will be a 100 percent upfront provision. If you report fraud after a few years, the provisioning can be spread across a period; hence less impact on books,” said the banker who requested anonymity.

Did SBI delay reporting the fraud and filing the complaint with CBI for this reason? The article will be updated when SBI responds.

Vijay Mallya déjà vuIn many ways, the similarities between the Ramdev International case and the infamous Vijay Mallya case are stark. By the time SBI and other banks moved Supreme Court in 2016, Mallya had left the country (on March 2) to the UK after defaulting Rs 9,000 crore disbursed by 17 banks, including SBI, to his defunct Kingfisher Airline.

Banks had clearly acted late in the case. The Kingfisher Airlines account had tuned NPA in 2012. Even after four years, banks are still struggling to get Mallya back though he has offered to pay.

The NPA mess has broken the back of India’s banking system. Yet, the episodes of Ramdev International and Kingfisher show unscrupulous promoters still have hope of receiving a free rein from negligent bankers."

State Bank of India (SBI) has recommended a uniform inter-creditor agreement (ICA) framework among lenders to fast track loan restructuring process.

A uniform agreement will essentially specify broad guidelines for restructuring loans to be followed by all banks.

This is being considered given many borrowers affected by the coronavirus crisis may ask banks to restructure their loans, and lenders need to arrive at a consensus for at least a year-and-a-half, according to an Economic Times report.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

The idea of a uniform ICA framework had been considered earlier but due to lack of a consensus, each bank began taking up loan restructuring on a case-to-case basis.

India is currently in a nationwide lockdown, which began on March 25, to contain the spread of COVID-19.

""The restructuring plan should be simple and easily implementable. If one tries to find the financial viability of a company in a conventional way..., it would not be a meaningful exercise. One will end up making unrealistic assumptions which would collapse later,"" a banker told the paper.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has granted on term loans whose instalments are due between March 1 and May 31.

The banking industry is hoping the RBI permits them to restructure loans without classifying them as non-performing assets (NPAs), the report said.

The CBI had recently booked the company engaged in export of Basmati rice to the West Asian and European countries and its directors Naresh Kumar, Suresh Kumar and Sangita on the basis of complaint from the State Bank of India (SBI), which suffered the loss of more than Rs 173 crore, they said.

The company had three rice milling plants, besides eight sorting and grading units in Karnal district with offices in Saudi Arabia and Dubai for trading purposes, the SBI complaint said.

Besides SBI, other members of consortium are Canara Bank, Union Bank of India, IDBI, Central Bank of India and Corporation Bank, they said.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) did not carry out any searches in the matter because of the coronavirus-induced lockdown, the officials said.

The agency will start the process of summoning the accused, incase they do not join the investigation, appropriate legal action will be initiated, they said.

According to the complaint filed by SBI, the account had become non-performing asset (NPA) on January 27, 2016.

The banks conducted a joint inspection of properties in August and October, nearly 7-9 months later only to find Haryana Police security guards deployed there, they said.

""On inquiry, it has been come to notice that borrowers are absconding and have left the country,"" the complaint filed on February 25, 2020, after over a year of account becoming NPA, the officials said.

"May 07, 2020 11:21 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/state-bank-of-india-hikes-home-loan-rates-by-20-bps-from-may-1-5238801.html,"In a surprise move, the State Bank of India (SBI) has hiked its effective home loan rate by 20 basis points for new borrowers by widening the spread over its repo rate-linked external benchmark rate. (100 bps=1 percentage point)

This move comes at a time when the bank has reduced its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) across tenures by 15 bps, with effect from May 10. A month ago, the public sector behemoth slashed its repo-linked external benchmark rate (EBR) by 75 basis points, following the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) policy action. The increase in effective home loan rates, which comes in the backdrop of a benign interest rate environment, is effective May 1.

The spreads over the external benchmark rate, which ranged from 15-50 bps across loan amount brackets prior to May 1, have widened to 35-70 bps now. For example, for loans up to Rs 30 lakh, the minimum effective rate will now be 7.4 percent (7.35 percent for women) against 7.20 percent (7.15 percent for women) prior to May 1. Its repo-linked EBR remains unchanged at 7.05 percent.

“The bank might have taken this step to protect its income as the repo rate has dropped substantially, but at the same time the cost of deposits has not gone down as much,” said a senior industry official who spoke on condition of anonymity. However, this mark-up revision will not affect existing borrowers. “The widened spread will be effective prospectively for new home loan customers. This is because components of the spread, barring credit risk premium, mentioned in the home loan agreement cannot be altered for at least three years once the contract is signed,” he added.

From October 1, 2019, all banks have had to mandatorily link their new, floating-rate retail loans to an external benchmark to ensure better transmission of policy rates and greater transparency. Most banks have picked repo rate as their external benchmark. SBI passed on the entire 75 bps repo cut announced by RBI on March 27 to their borrowers promptly from April 1. On the other hand, its one-year MCLR – to which its home loans are linked – fell 35 bps on April 10 and a further 15 bps effective May 10. Even if MCLR-linked and repo-linked home loan rates were to be comparable, the latter hold the edge due to greater transparency they offer – banks have no choice but to pass on entire repo rate revisions to their customers.

“There is no communication from the bank so far on the reasons for this increase in mark-up. It needs to clarify the rationale behind this move at a time when we are in a supremely benign interest rate environment,” said an industry-watcher who did not wish to be named.

SBI had not responded to Moneycontrol’s emails and messages at the time of publishing this story."

The one-year lending rate now stands reduced to 7.25 percent from 7.40 percent, effective May 10. This is the twelfth consecutive reduction in bank’s MCLR, the lender said.

Consequently, equated monthly instalments (EMI) on eligible home loan accounts (linked to MCLR) will get cheaper by approx. Rs 255.00 for a 30-year loan of Rs 25 lakh.

In a move that will hurt retirees and those depending on interest income for their livelihood, India’s largest public sector bank has cut interest rates on retail term deposits by 20 bps for tenors up to three years. The cut, too, comes into effect from May 12.

However, the bank has introduced a new retail term deposit scheme for senior citizens. Under the new scheme, SBI Wecare Deposit, senior citizens will get an additional 30 bps premium on deposits of five years and above. This scheme would be in effect until September 30, 2020.

Thus, the effective rate of interest for retail term deposits of senior citizens will be:

- 5 years and below tenor: 50 bps higher than the rate applicable for the general public (no change in premium)

- 5 years and above tenor: 80 bps higher than the rate applicable for the general public (30 bps extra premium)."

With the banking sector sitting on high provision for non-performing assets and the COVID-19 crisis expected to worsen the situation, State Bank of India (SBI) and other major lenders are reviving the idea of a ""bad bank"".

CNBC-TV18 reported that the bad bank will have a structure that combines elements of asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) and asset management companies (AMCs).

SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar told CNBC-TV18 there is a view at the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) level that it's the right time for a structure along the lines of a bad bank.

The plan is still in the consultation stage and at the IBA level, he said.

""A bad bank three years ago was not feasible, because provisions were inadequate. Today, we have adequate provisions and net book value is hardly 10-15 percent of gross NPAs,"" Kumar said.

IBA will seek the government's approval for the bad bank, the news channel reported. Banks have been asked to submit their suggestions by May 7.

Lenders plan to transfer their large bad loans to the ARC at a discount, the report added.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

REC, PFC participation may be crucial for the bad bank to become successful, sources told CNBC-TV18.

A separate report by The Economic Times said banks intend to request an initial contribution of at least Rs 10,000-15,000 crore from the government."

CNBC-TV18 reported that SBI might discuss the plan at a board meeting on May 6.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

RBI had granted a three-month moratorium on term loan deposits for instalments due between March 1 and May 31. It had not specified whether borrowings by NBFCs are covered under the moratorium.

The moratorium is intended to provide borrowers relief during the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

On the matter of NBFCs, the central bank has allowed lenders to make decisions on a case-by-case basis, CNBC-TV18 reported.

So far, SBI had been providing NBFCs financial support in the form of loans, the report said.

Other major banks are waiting for SBI's decision before granting relief to NBFCs, the report added.

Fitch Ratings on Thursday downgraded the viability ratings (VR) of State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank and Axis Bank to 'bb' from 'bb+' on account of deteriorating operating environment for banks amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The global rating agency also downgraded Bank of Baroda's (BOB) VR by one notch to 'bb-', from 'bb'.

The agency affirmed the long-term issuer default ratings (IDR) of SBI and BOB at 'BBB-' and those of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank at 'BB+'.

The outlook for all the four banks has been kept as stable.

""The rating actions are driven by rapid deterioration in the operating environment for banks in the country following the coronavirus pandemic and measures to contain its spread,"" the agency said.

For SBI and BOB, the VR downgrades reflect the heightened risks that weakening asset quality will pose to their less-than-satisfactory loss-absorption buffers.

""We expect SBI's and BOB's financial performances to worsen, although their asset-quality problems may not materialise until the effects of the 90-day regulatory moratorium on impaired loans recognition wear off,"" it said.

The VR downgrades of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank highlight heightened risks to their asset qualities and earnings from the disruption in business and consumer activity, which the rating agency expects to continue well beyond the lockdown in the country.

Besides these banks, the rating agency also affirmed IDRs of Punjab National Bank (PNB), Bank of India (BOI) and Canara Bank at 'BBB-', with stable outlooks.

The viability rating of PNB has been affirmed at 'b' and that of Canara Bank at 'bb-'.

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

The endgame appears to be nearing for fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya. With a UK Court dismissing Mallya’s latest plea on Monday, investigative agencies might be panting in anticipation at Mallya's impending extradition to India soon.

But after four years of Mallya’s exit, what does his return mean for about 17 Indian banks that have over Rs 10,000 crore (including the accrued interest amount) in combined exposure to Mallya’s defunct Kingfisher Airlines?

In a series of tweets Mallya said he is “naturally disappointed” with the UK court’s decision. “I will continue to pursue further legal remedies as advised by my lawyers,” said the former Kingfisher boss. Mallya argues that he owes only about Rs 6,200 crore to banks and claims that lenders have recovered Rs 2,500 crore already. But, banks do not agree.

According to senior banking industry officials, there is a great deal of uncertainty on the recovery of money even if Mallya is brought back to the country. “Let me put it this way. Banks have done almost everything possible including putting up his personal assets for auction. Despite all of this, there has been no significant recovery so far. Unless Mallya himself decides to pay up the full amount, there is very little hope left,” said the banker who didn’t want to be identified.

Until now, banks have not recovered even a fraction of the amount what Mallya - who has denied wrongdoing - owes to them. Bankers said the original Rs 9,000 crore that was lent to Mallya has now grown to Rs 10,000 crore at least, which includes the accrued interest amount.

The Rs 10,000 crore, according to bankers, is a conservative estimate. The actual figure could be more. In a typical loan default case, banks wouldn’t wait for things to worsen to this stage and interest burden to escalate. They initiate legal process at the first sign of default and approach the relevant courts for recovery.

In Mallya’s case, bankers acted too late. Theoretically, the lenders can still sell his shareholding in companies and recover money. Since Mallya's real estate assets, which include a Mumbai office property, his cars and other personal belongings, wouldn’t fetch much value, banks are pinning their hopes on acquiring Mallya’s stake holding in United Spirits and United Breweries.

Mallya's holding in United Breweries is 11.04 percent which has a value Rs 2,696 crore and that of United Spirits (1.52 percent) at Rs 582 crore. In total, if banks manage to sell these share holdings on April 20, banks would get Rs 3,278 crore.​

But selling these shares and recovering money isn’t that easy.

A ‘wanted’ figure

There are multiple cases in various Indian courts filed by banks and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). “Both the ED and banks want a share of these assets. There is no clarity,” said a former chairman of a state-run bank that was part of the Kingfisher loan consortium.

But another banker said lender indeed had the first right on the proceeds from the sale of assets, and the ED can claim only those assets where financial fraud is involved.

In the last four years, Mallya has repeated his offer to banks to pay back the principal amount to banks. “I request the banks with folded hands, take 100 percent of your principal back, immediately,"" Mallya said outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London early this year.

But banks, which have dealt with him in the past, don’t attach too much importance to this offer. “These are just statements. Don’t read too much into it. Where is the money?” asked one of the senior bankers on condition of anonymity.

The great escape

Mallya, once the poster boy of Indian civil aviation industry, left for the UK on March 2, 2016. This was just hours before a consortium of banks rushed to the Supreme Court seeking his detention and the immediate repayment of outstanding dues on loans. Mallya's debt to banks was a result of a series of borrowings in multiple installments to keep Kingfisher alive.

Since his flight to the UK, Mallya, 64, has been waging a legal war against his lenders, investigators and the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) by disputing charges of financial fraud and wilful default leveled against him.

The MEA, in April, 2016, revoked his passport. Several rounds of hearings in British and Indian courts have happened since then, which led to Mallya being arrested and released within hours multiple times. While the court room drama continues, the banks have become sitting ducks as no money has come back to them yet.

On February 18, the Supreme Court adjourned a plea by Mallya that was seeking a stay on the proceedings initiated by the ED to declare him a fugitive economic offender and confiscate his assets. The matter was scheduled to be heard in March after the Holi break of the court but the lockdown meant to control the spread of COVID-19 have hindered the hearing to take place. To cut a long story court, in the long legal battle, the flamboyant son of Vittal Mallya has so far managed to have a clear upper hand over his legal opponents. That is till today’s UK Court decision.

How the cookie crumbled for banks

There was a time when banks queued up before Mallya's office to gift him loans, with or without collateral. For them, Mallya's name was enough to sign the disbursal forms. There were 17 banks headed by country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI), which lent money to Kingfisher over a period of few years (both fund based and non-fund) and issued fresh funding lines when Mallya’s company was struggling to stay afloat.

Close to Rs 1,700 crore was disbursed by SBI, the lead bank of the group, while IDBI Bank gave Rs 900 crore. Other banks, a mix of state-run and private lenders, contributed a few hundred crore each. Much of the loans was given based on a personal guarantee of Mallya. The other collateral included the Kingfisher brand — one of the rarest cases when a huge sum was lent to a corporate just against the brand name.

These banks later converted a sizable chunk of loans into equity. SBI and ICICI Bank had converted Kingfisher's shares at Rs 64.48 each, which was at a 60 percent premium to then prevailing market price. The prices crashed to reach penny stock values within 16 months. Kingfisher has since been de-listed from the exchanges.

Clearly, banks wouldn’t earn anything by selling these shares. Neither can they think of reviving the company for the simple reason that they know nothing about the business of aviation. So if they were to recover any loans, they should have sold the shares quickly. This didn’t happen.

A defiant man

Mallya has never conceded defeat to banks or investigative agencies at any point of the long legal battle of four years. The loans to Kingfisher turned bad in 2012. Since then, no repayment has happened; instead, Mallya has engaged in a war of words with lenders to prove his point that the bad loan happened due to his business failure, not financial fraud.

Indian banks and investigators have not been able to make a watertight case against Mallya yet in the UK. The liquor baron, who lives in his UK mansion with his family, once made it clear that, “By taking my passport or arresting me, they are not getting any money”. During his good days, Mallya used to be called as the 'King of Good Times'. He still is.

The Mallya-Kingfisher episode is a big lesson in their career for the bankers involved. Most of the bankers who had initially negotiated with Mallya on the loans given to Kingfisher, have retired from service. They secretly admit that they have gone wrong in the credit evaluation process. Bankers forgot the golden rules before the flamboyant liquor baron and lent to an airline that never made profits in its eight years of existence.

Even after the red signals were flashing, banks acted too late on recovery, and paid a heavy price for that. The Kingfisher episode has acted like an eye opener to their successors in office. New generation bankers are now more cautious on similar cases and are not leaving anything to chance.

The Jet Airways, DHFL cases are example. But, Kingfisher will remain as an unhealed wound for Indian lenders. Four years after his exit, the liquor baron who loves sports cars and luxury yachts, still remains elusive, and the Rs 10,000 crore he owes to the banks: a distant, fading hope.

Saluting the efforts of bankers to provide services amid coronavirus threat, the Finance Ministry on Monday said public sector banks (PSBs) have provided insurance cover to employees in case of an unfortunate death due to the deadly virus.

Banks have also expressed their commitment to ensuring the well being of their employees by providing protective gear and medical care.

Banks have appointed dedicated doctors for its employees and also set up helpline to attend to the concerns of staff, sources said. ""Salute to all bankers providing services across India in this critical time. To ensure their safety, PSBs have provided health cover (incl of #Covid-19) to all employees and also lumpsum compensation in case of an unfortunate death due to #Corona,"" the Finance Ministry said in a tweet.

According to sources, banks have designed their own customised product keeping in mind interest of their employees and up to Rs 20 lakh lumpsum amount will be paid to relative in case of unfortunate event due to COVID-19.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman have praised bankers for imparting their duty in these challenging times.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Financial services are part of some of the essential services which have been operational during the lockdown that will continue till May 3.

Several banks including SBI, Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India and Indian Bank have taken various steps to ensure safety of their employees and protect them from coronavirus.

For example, the country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has set up a quick response team to keep the staff motivated amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The bank has set up a helpline number manned by doctors and psychologists to assist its staff and employees to deal with the coronavirus outbreak as well as stress and anxiety related to this, sources said.

State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Sunday urged small and medium enterprises to act prudently and avoid over-leveraging during the current situation where there is a lot of uncertainty. Speaking at an event organised by FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO) through video conferencing, Kumar said that if enterprises have some inherent weaknesses then they should not go for short-term borrowings.

""In these uncertain situations, all businesses will need more working capital funds, which the banking system should provide, but prudence would also, at the same time, demand that over-leveraging even in these circumstances is avoidable as the money has to be repaid, and there is also an interest cost,"" Kumar said while speaking on the topic 'Rescuing the MSME sector post-COVID'.

He, however, said that if having more working capital at this difficult time can help one bring back their business to normal within the next six months to one year, then they should go for it.

Kumar warned that for businesses with fundamental flaws or inherent weakness, short-term borrowing is not advisable at this juncture.

""Then it is advisable to go for a deeper restructuring because if people borrow for short term and are unable to repay on time, it will spoil their credit history,"" he said.

He said banks are reassessing the working capital requirements for businesses on a case-to-case basis.

Talking about providing liquidity support to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), Kumar said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently announced various measures such as targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO 2.0) to help these shadow banking players meet their funding needs.

""We are reaching out to them (NBFCs) and requesting them to give their cash budget. Based on that, whatever is their short-term liquidity requirement, we will support them,"" he said.

The RBI had announced to conduct Rs 50,000 crore of TLTRO 2.0 in various tranches.

The funds availed under TLTRO 2.0 will have to be invested in investment grade bonds, commercial paper, and non-convertible debentures of NBFCs, with at least 50 per cent of the total amount availed going to small and mid-sized NBFCs and MFIs.

Kumar said banks can support NBFCs or MFIs by helping to issue bonds, which can be funded through TLTRO.

""If MFIs are not eligible for bonds because they do not have the required investment grade ratings, then we may be comfortable giving loans to them on the basis of their credit history,"" he said.

On the RBI's three-month moratorium for NBFCs, he said, ""I think the glamour around the across-the-board moratorium for the financial intermediaries has to be properly understood.""

""We know that there is an impact on their (NBFCs) collections but there is an impact on their outflows as the disbursement is not as high as it used to be,"" Kumar said.

He said his bank has extended the repayment date for MSMEs who have opted for a one-time settlement (OTS) scheme to June 30, 2020, from March 31, 2020.

According to Kumar, the tourism sector has been affected the most and the 90-day loan repayment moratorium and giving 10 per cent working capital limit may not be sufficient for the players in the segment.

""For the tourism industry, the only way would be to restructure the loan,"" he said.

India's GDP growth may slide to 1.1 percent in the current financial year, on account of the impact of coronavirus outbreak on the economy, a research report by SBI said on Thursday.

The economic growth rate during 2019-20 is estimated to come down to 4.1 percent from 5 percent projected by several agencies before the outbreak of deadly virus, which affected more than 20 lakh persons around the world and took lives of over 1.3 lakh people.

In order to check the spread of COVID-19, the government has decided to extend the lockdown to May 3, with some relaxations for specified sectors.

According to the SBI Ecowrap report, the extension of the lockdown would result in economic loss of Rs 12.1 lakh crore or 6 percent of the nominal Gross Value Added (GVA).

""With the lockdown now being extended till May 3 and simultaneously Government providing some relaxations from April 20, we estimate the overall loss for FY21 around Rs 12.1 lakh crore/6 percent of nominal GVA taking the nominal GVA growth for entire year to be around 4.2 percent.

""Nominal GDP for FY21 could be lower/closer to 4.2 percent, as there is a strong possibility of subsidies outstripping tax collections. However, taking nominal GDP growth at 4.2 percent, the real GDP growth for FY21 would be around 1.1 percent,"" said the report.

The lockdown, the report said, will have a significant impact on several macroeconomic parameters.

Quoting PLFS survey 2017-18, the report said, there are 37.3 crore workers engaged as self-employed, regular and casual workers, with share of self employed at 52 percent, casual worker at 25 percent and the rest engaged as regular wage earners and others.

""We estimate the income loss per day of these 37.3 crore workers due to lockdown is around Rs 10,000 crore, which translates into a loss of Rs 4.05 lakh crore for the entire lockdown period. For causal labourers, this income loss it at least Rs 1 lakh crore. Thus any fiscal package should at least strive to more than make up for this Rs 4 lakh crore income loss,"" it added.

Secondly, ""as our GDP forecasts change, fiscal estimates will also change accordingly. Net Tax Revenue will have a shortfall of at least around Rs 4.12 lakh crores, and Revenue shortfall for states will be Rs 1.32 lakh crores. The revised fiscal deficit would be at 5.7 percent of GDP and after taking into account only the current EBR the deficit rises to 6.6 percent of GDP,"" it noted.

The fiscal deficit of the states is expected to rise to 3.5 percent of GDP from the budgeted 2 percent in FY21.

""We estimate that the EBR number will rise significantly as Government will try to mobilise resources more through unconventional means like COVID Bonds, monetisation of deficit and others,"" as per the report.

The consolidated fiscal deficit might rise to 10 percent of GDP on an unchanged EBR, it said, adding a 4 percent slippage in nominal GDP tantamount to Rs 8 lakh crore of fiscal support."

State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Saturday exhorted real estate firms to keep their bank account standard, clear inventory as soon as possible and improve perception about the business.

While plain-speaking to the real estate players, Kumar said course correction has to be undertaken by the industry if they want to survive and get back on track as soon as possible.

""Clear inventory as soon as possible. We believed that prices will go up but unfortunately the prices are not going up. There was a time when there were first time home buyers and there were investors and in five years you could double your money...those times are over,"" he said in a virtual conference organised by realtors' body NAREDCO.

Besides, he suggested that industry should explore opportunities to cut down the cost and improve turnaround time.

""How do we reduce the construction period? How do we keep cost under control on the construction material side? Industry should impress upon state and local governments that it is not a cash cow which you can keep on milking. So, let us reduce the cost of construction,"" he said.

On the banking side, he assured, it would be the endeavour to keep interest rates low as much as possible, depending on macroeconomic situation.

The effort of everyone should be towards the objective of making housing affordable, and building units fast as well as selling them quickly rather than holding inventory for a longer period in anticipation of price rise, he added.

On perception about the real estate industry, SBI chief said, there is a need to improve corporate governance although Real Estate Regulation and Development Act (RERA) has brought in some discipline but still a long way to go.

""I am not saying this but the perception about the real estate industry is that a lot of profiteering takes place, a lot of under hand dealing takes place. Not all transactions happen in white. This may be reality or this may be perception I don't know. These perceptions at the industry level needs to be corrected.

""As an industry body you can do something to improve corporate governance. RERA has made a lot of difference, demonetisation has sucked a lot of cash but still I believe a lot of projects we have not been able to control these aspects,"" he said.

Observing that the role of the real estate industry in the economy is very crucial, he said construction is about 15 percent of the GDP and it provides employment to a large number of people.

With regard to increasing moratorium beyond three months, Kumar said, the call has to be taken by the Reserve Bank of India.

However, he said, banks through Indian Banks' Association will request for raising the loan moratorium period from the existing three months to may be 5-6 months depending on evolving situation.

On enhancing emergency credit line to industry from the existing 10 percent to 20 percent, he said, it can be considered on a case to case basis by the field level officials.

""Reassessment of working capital we are ready to do...you can approach the bank on revised cash budget. Based on the revised budget, we will give 10 per cent or 20 percent depending on requirement. What I would suggest for getting all these help, you keep the account updated. Clear your dues. Keep your account standard,"" he said.

He assured the industry that banks stand behind the industry in this difficult times.

Last month, SBI opened an emergency credit facility for borrowers affected by coronavirus outbreak. The additional liquidity facility – COVID-19 Emergency Credit Line (CECL), will provide funds up to Rs 200 crore or 10 percent of the existing fund based working capital.

The window will be available till June 30 and loan will be offered at an interest rate of 7.25 percent with a tenure of 12 months."

Economists at SBI on April 8 said a bulk of the Rs 1.75 lakh crore coronavirus aid package announced by the Secludes budgeted elements and pitched for a Rs 3 lakh crore top-up to help the economy tide over the COVID-19-related challenges.

Only Rs 73,000 crore of the Rs 1.75 lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month is fresh money as the rest was already budgeted for, the economists said, adding a ""large fiscal package"" for affected industries"" is necessary at this point.

The already sagging economic growth is expected to go down further due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a three-week lockdown across the country starting March 25.

Some analysts believe GDP growth will come at 2 per cent for FY21. ""... given labour and capital income loss of around Rs 3.60 lakh crore, the minimum subsistence fiscal package must be scaled up by Rs 3 lakh crore, over and above the incremental Rs 73,000 crore that was unleashed in the first phase,"" an SBI economist said in a note.

The note said 98 per cent of the banking system's outstanding credit is in the 284 districts of the country affected by the COVID-19 and asked for needful attention to be given to the banking system.

Joining other watchers, the economists at the country's largest lender also called for some relief to the troubled NBFCs sector, which has been excluded from the three-month moratorium on loan repayments to financial institutions, and warned that if things deteriorate there will be an erosion of capital for such entities.

Similarly, from a labour perspective, the dent is maximum in the hotels, trade, education, petroleum and agriculture sectors, while self-employment accounts for 30 per cent of the GDP, it said.

""A fiscal package is imperative now,"" it reminded the policymakers. In what can be said as a brighter side, the economists estimated credit offtake has increased in the final fortnight of March across various verticals, despite the COVID-19 scares, which illustrates confidence within businesses of a surge in demand post-lockdown.

They estimated the incremental credit offtake at Rs 2.10 lakh crore in March, of which agriculture will be Rs 10,000 crore, industry Rs 1.20 lakh crore, services Rs 60,000 crore and personal loans Rs 20,000 crore.

The note welcomed talk of a staggered pullout from the lockdown and pitched for top preference to be given to agriculture and procurement, followed by inland transport (both roads and railways), a trading activity that supports over 25 crore households, hotel services and limited construction activity to be allowed in the unaffected areas.

From a demographic perspective, they said the population should be divided into the hospitalised, immunity compromised, and healthy individuals and we should have a well-defined strategy for each group as there is no herd immunity in the population for COVID-19.

Banks generally don’t give any publicity for reductions in their deposit rates the way they do for lending rate cuts. The reason is logical: Every cut in deposit rates is bad news for the customer. For this reason, when the country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) slashed its lending rates by a huge 75 basis points (one bps is one-hundredth of a percentage point), hours after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a significant 75 bps repo rate cut, it was widely publicised. People cheered the RBI and SBI hoping that their equated monthly instalment (EMI) burden will ease significantly. But not many would have expected that this will soon be followed up with a cut in deposit rates. That has happened now.

Effective April 15, the country’s largest lender SBI will offer an interest rate of 2.5 percent for savings deposit rates. This is the lowest-ever return Indian banks will offer to customers on their savings deposits. Till last month, SBI used to offer 3.25 percent on these accounts, which was cut to 3 percent on March 11. The explanation behind SBI’s savings rate cut is that the bank has adequate liquidity and hence it doesn’t need to incentivise further deposit inflows.

The RBI’s liquidity easing measures and nearly zero demand for fresh loans mean banks are abundant with liquidity. They do not need to chase low-cost deposits now as they used to do a while ago. But the bigger message is this: If banks are pushed to the corner to cut lending rates, they will make up for the losses by bringing down the deposit rates to protect their margins. Banks are always margin hungry. They raise money from depositors and borrow from the RBI's repo window. Any changes on one side will have to reflect on the other side.

To be sure, SBI has a good reason for lowering the savings rate. Ever since bank savings rate deregulation happened in 2011, savings rate among large Indian banks has remained unchanged at 4 percent. Till then the rate was administered at 3.5 percent for several years (the change before that was done in 2003). Though lending rate deregulation happened in India in the 1990s, savings rate continued to be an administered rate. When this rate was deregulated, the idea was to give an opportunity to the common savers to earn high returns as it was believed that competition would prompt banks to offer better savings rate. Both fixed deposit rates and lending rates have been tweaked several times but not savings rates. Certain smaller and medium-sized banks have offered higher rates, but the industry has largely agreed upon a 4 percent rate.

The 4 percent savings rate was first brought down by SBI in July, 2017, a few months after demonetisation. SBI cut the rate straight to 3.5 percent from 4 percent. There were three major reasons given. a) inflation falling and real returns improving b) demonetisation money flooding banks and C) likely downward bias on interest rates. These reasons were good enough for the bank to defend its move then. Also, it makes great economic sense for SBI to reduce the savings rate.

With savings rate at 2.75 percent, customers have no reason to park their money in plain savings accounts. What are the other options? Even with a recent reduction in small savings rates by 70 bps-120bps, some of the schemes still look attractive for them as this Moneycontrol story highlights . Fixed deposit rates aren’t competitive.

Also, reduced returns on savings deposits is one more reason why borrowers, who have enough cash flows to pay their EMIs, should not opt for the recent moratorium offer. It makes no sense to pay interest above 7.5 percent to banks and park money for 2.75 percent return. The simultaneous cut in SBI’s marginal cost of lending rates (MCLR) by 35 bps is sentimentally positive for borrowers but won’t be a decisive factor for a new home loan buyer to make his decision.

What next? SBI’s cut in savings rate will likely be followed up with a reduction in fixed deposit (FD) rates as well. SBI right now offers 5.7 percent to 1-2 years FDs. This will likely come down further. Most banks will take cues from SBI’s savings deposit rate cut soon and later do the same in FD rates. Those customers who have already locked in their money in FDs will not be affected.

“It is almost certain that term deposit rates will come down next. Banks will have to align their lending rate cuts with deposit rate reductions,” said a Mumbai-based banking analyst. Many banks had recently reduced their fixed deposit rates. These banks may further bring it down in the wake of the SBI rate action. That will be bad news for savers, especially senior citizens who typically prefer bank deposits over other riskier instruments."

State Bank of India (SBI) may offer all its term loan borrowers a three-month moratorium to tide over economic difficulties during the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, BloombergQuint reported.

India’s largest lender, SBI, will offer the moratorium to all customers, with an option to ‘opt out’, rather than making individual assessments, sources told the publication. This is so as to minimise delay in providing relief to customers.

Apart from individuals, working capital loans availed by micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) will also be offered the same moratorium, officials added.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

Borrowers not impacted by COVID-19 related disruptions can opt out of the moratorium and can inform the bank to continue making payments, the report added.

Besides this, the bank is also looking to extend support to securitised loan pools purchased with underlying assets that qualify for the moratorium, the source added.

The bank will release a communication campaign to generate awareness and detail specifics of the moratorium, how it will impact the repayment schedule, and make known the ‘opt out’ option.

The board of the bank is set to meet this week to finalise the decisions.

On the flip side, worries are emerging about lenders’ liquidity position if customers avail the moratorium en masse

As per a report by The Economic Times, if a large number of borrowers defer loan payments, it could off-set the benefits if extra liquidity.

In such a scenario, banks would be reluctant to extend moratoriums to certain category of borrowers – such as government or large company’s employees – whose salaries have not been impacted.

Banks with high credit-deposit ratio are also concerned that, if more than 50 percent borrowers opt for the moratorium, the liquidity announced by the RBI would be lower than the interest payments to be made.

“Since these banks will have to continue to pay depositors the interest and maturity amounts, such a situation could actually worsen the liquidity position of banks,” a senior banker told ET.

The new rates, to be effective from April 1, will be applicable for its borrowers availing loans based on external benchmark-linked lending rate (EBR) and repo-linked lending rate (RLLR), the bank said in a statement.

SBI has reduced its EBR to 7.05 percent from 7.80 percent per annum. Likewise, RLLR stands reduced to 6.65 percent from 7.40 percent annually.

The move came hours after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das announced that repo rates are slashed by 75 bps."

A consortium of lenders led by State Bank of India (SBI) will add about Rs 770 crore to their bottomlines during the fourth quarter following the exit of Jindal Stainless Ltd (JSL) from the Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) framework. SBI, the lead banker, will get Rs 300 crore from the resolution of this account, sources said.

Punjab National Bank (PNB) will write back about Rs 100 crore from this, sources said, adding that other lenders like Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank too will be able to show cash recovery from this account.

All the lenders will recover a total of Rs 770 crore from this account during the last quarter which is considered difficult due to outbreak of coronavirus.

This will add to the profitability of banks in the current quarter and should help in absorbing the new provisions made during this year, sources added.

The case of JSL was referred to the CDR framework in 2009 when the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) did not exist.

Earlier this month, JSL announced its exit from CDR framework. The company received a letter from the consortium of CDR lenders to this effect on March 4.

""Pursuant to this, existing CDR lenders have realised the full recompense of about Rs 275 crore in cash, which will add to their income in the current fiscal itself.

“Additionally, JSL has fully redeemed the outstanding Optionally Convertible Redeemable Preference Shares (OCRPS), which were issued to the lenders in June 2017, and has paid around Rs 558 crore, taking the aggregate realisation of lenders to around Rs 833 crore,"" the company had said in a statement.

Earlier, the promoter group entity had infused equity and subsequently JSL issued Non-convertible Debentures (NCDs) worth Rs 400 crore to Kotak Special Situations Fund (KSSF) and the fund mobilised assisted JSL in redeeming the OCRPS.

""KSSF has also acquired approximately 5 percent equity stake in JSL through the secondary market, which demonstrates increased investors' confidence in the company's operations and growth outlook,"" it had said.

The CDR framework came into existence in 2001 with the objective to restructure corporate debt outside the purview of debt recovery tribunals (DRT) and the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction."

Crisil on March 19 said that Arundhati Bhattacharya, the past chairman of State Bank of India, has submitted her resignation as independent director of the company effective April 15. In her resignation, Bhattacharya has indicated that the reason for her resignation is her decision to accept a full time role as chairperson and CEO in another company, the filing said.

""Bhattacharya, an Independent Director of the company, has submitted her resignation as a director of the company, which will take effect on April 15, 2020,"" Crisil Ltd said in a filing to BSE.

She has confirmed that there is no other material reason, other than the reason stated in her resignation, it added.

""I wish to advise that I have decided to accept a full time executive role as chairperson and CEO for the India operations of Salesforce, USA. Accordingly, I need to discontinue my existing non-executive assignments,"" Bhattacharya said in her resignation letter to the board of directors.

I sincerely regret that I will have to step down as non-executive Independent Director from the board as well as from the committees of Crisil board, from April 16, 2020,"" the letter said.

Bhattacharya was the first woman to lead the more than two centuries-old State Bank of India, which controls over a quarter of the nation's banking system.

She retired in 2017 after a one-year extension, spending four decades in various roles and then moved onto the international payment platform Swift India as its chairman, a position she still occupies."

On September 30, 2013, the last day of Pratip Chaudhuri at State Bank of India (SBI) as the Chairman, there was considerable suspense in the Mumbai headquarters of the bank on his likely successor. There were four names — all managing directors of the bank — who figured prominently in the discussions. And Arundhati Bhattacharya’s name was the least mentioned one. But, far away in New Delhi, top babus in the government already knew the name. The then Union finance minister, P Chiambaram, had already cleared Bhattacharya’s name on September 25. The government announcement appointing Bhattacharya as the first ever woman chief of the country’s largest lender came soon after the clearance from the appointments committee of the cabinet, headed by the then prime minister, Manmohan Singh. Bhattacharya, who was till then the chief financial officer and the youngest MD among the four (she was 57 then), took charge as the new SBI chief. That was a surprise choice.

Comes Salesforce

Seven years later, Bhattacharya continues to surprise the industry with her career choices. After her stint with Swift India, a banking technology service provider, Bhattacharya will soon take over as the India head of US cloud-based service provider Salesforce.com Inc. Bhattacharya is entering the US technology firm at a time Salesforce wants to ramp up cloud storage and digital service business in India, creating more than 500,000 jobs and $67 billion in new business revenues in India through 2024, according to a 2019 report by International Data Corporation.

Why would a banker choose a technology firm? Bhattacharya isn’t a stranger to technology assignments. Till recently she was associated with banking technology enabler, Swift India. Speaking to Moneycontrol, Bahttacharya said she isn’t averse to the idea of multidiscipline and multiple careers, which according to her, will be the future. “I come from a liberal arts background. That’s how things will be in future. Multidiscipline, multiple careers,” Bhattacharya said, adding that she wouldn’t want to comment on the ongoing issues in the Indian banking sector.

During Bhattacharya’s tenure SBI witnessed technology platforms advancing by several notches, her former colleague said, adding that she loved gadgets and worked to integrate banking services to new technology platforms. Bhattacharya is remembered by former colleagues at SBI as a chief who had thorough subject knowledge of industry and finances. “She was an excellent people manager and had earned praise from all colleagues for teamwork,” said the colleague quoted earlier.

The NPA riddle

However, not all was rosy on SBI’s books during her tenure. Bhattacharya’s stint in SBI had witnessed stress in the bank’s books rising substantially and a sharp decline in key parameters such as return on equity that fell from 15.85 percent in March, 2013 to negative 2.13 percent in 2018. The total gross NPAs, between 2013 and 2018, rose to 4.75 percent in March, 2017 to 10.91 percent in March, 2018. Net NPAs, after provisions and taxes, rose from 2.10 percent to 5.73 percent in the same period. “But most of the loans that had turned bad was inherited from the previous regime,” said a former colleague of Bhattacharya. “Bhattacharya was at the wrong place at the wrong time,” said the person.

It was not uncommon in those days an outgoing PSU bank chairman passing on most of the NPA provisioning burden to the successor in a bid to show a clean book. Naturally, the new person will be welcomed with a shock as he/she will have to make entire provisioning in the subsequent quarter leading to a sharp fall in the net profit numbers. To add to the woes, Bhattacharya’s term at SBI coincided with Raghuram Rajan’s war on NPAs. It was in 2015 when Rajan initiated the mega NPA cleanup exercise shaking up the banking sector. The NPA cleanup uncovered dirt hidden deep under the carpets of Indian banks causing the industry NPAs surge from around Rs 2 lakh crore to Rs 9 lakh crore over a few years. A slowing economy added to the banking sector's worries.

Despite the stress on SBI’s books, Bhattacharya’s leadership stood out, especially when the SBI group reorganisation activities she spearheaded reached the concluding phase. Bhattacharya played a key role in integrating the group subsidiaries to the parent, which was a long-pending proposal until then. The merger of five subsidiaries - State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Hyderabad - with SBI came into force from April 1, 2017.

At 64 and after four decades in the banking industry, the veteran banker is set for her new assignment."

It looks like stars are aligning for Yes Bank after the government notified a rescue plan for the private sector lender led by the State Bank of India (SBI) and joined by others.

The reconstruction deal is good for the depositors. However, it may not have gone down well for shareholders and bondholders. The reconstruction scheme notified on March 13, prescribes a three-year lock-in for all investors, including retail investors, to the extent of 75 percent of their holdings.

“All shareholders holding 100 or more equity shareholders are advised to exercise utmost caution while dealing in the script of the Bank and be guided by the enclosed scheme,” Yes Bank said in a release.

Only retail investors that hold under 100 Yes Bank shares are exempted. The lock-in is effective as of March 13.

Under the circumstance, the deal is ‘good’ for shareholders of Yes Bank as compared to the bondholders who have to face a write-down, suggest experts Moneycontrol spoke to.

This means that when trade of the stock resumes on March 16, any shareholder holding more than 100 shares will be able to sell only 25 percent of his/her shares, while the rest will be under lock-in.

“It is not a bad deal or negative for shareholders considering the fact that government has written off perpetual bonds. In the deal equity holders are not losing everything, instead, there is a lock-in,” AK Prabhakar, Head of Research at IDBI Capital told Moneycontrol.

“Shareholders can still liquidate 25 percent of their holding. But, remember the rescue plan was put in place by the government to rescue the depositors. Ideally, equity shareholders share should have become zero and then new equity should have come, but here the government has given some value to them which is still okay,” he said.

Last week, the proposal, which is a draft, stated that although all of Yes Bank's liabilities would continue as before, the additional tier 1 (AT1) capital bonds that the bank had issued, shall be written down permanently. This announcement has caught the Rs 28 trillion Indian mutual funds (MF) industry by surprise.

Prabhakar further added that it is a good deal and after three years if the bank sustains, shareholders will get a better value.

But, depositors come first

While the primary aim of the final reconstruction scheme for Yes Bank notified by the Centre, which locks-in 75 percent of all shareholding for three years, is a move in the right direction, it may not go down well with most of the shareholders.

In any rescue plan, the interest of depositors comes first. Hence, the regulator and the government is playing by the book and in case of equity shareholders, they have been slightly more generous which shareholders should take with both hands.

“The regulator and govt. has been extremely fair in demanding the same sacrifice of existing minority shareholders as being asked for SBI and other institutional shareholders who have answered the clarion call of the nation and come to the rescue of Yes Bank as an institution – the primary aim is to provide a safety net to existing depositors,” Ajay Bodke, CEO-PMS at Prabhudas Lilladher told Moneycontrol.

“Equity capital is a ‘risk’ capital, and in terms of financial claims, the safest are depositors, followed by Tier II capital, the Tier I capital, followed by preference shares and then comes common equity. Hence, in any rescue plan, it is equity capital is at most risk,” he added.

Bodke further explained that when the enterprise does well, the upside is shared by equity holders and not be debt holders. “Also, in the rescue plan Tier I bondholders have been asked to accept the full write down which is in line with Basel 3 norms, and if Quasi Equity can be written down to zero why should equity holders also not be on the same footing, but the regulator has been generous. Hence, I see no reason for shareholders to complain,” Bodke said.

Reduce volatility

Yes Bank's shares have rallied more than 300 percent after hitting a low of Rs 5.55 on March 6. The cash-strapped lender received a Rs 3,700 crore booster shot from five financial institutions along with SBI. The move is likely to calm the frayed nerves of investors and depositors.

The rescues plan is in the right direction to curb volatility in the stock, suggest experts. “The decision of three-year lock-in may disappoint retail investors especially the one who has invested looking at the momentum, but the intent of the government is to reduce the volatility,” Sanjeev Jain, VP Equity Research, Sunness Capital India told Moneycontrol. “Not to forget that volatility and business operations are different,” he added.

The Union Cabinet on March 13 approved the Yes Bank Reconstruction Scheme 2020, with a higher authorised capital of Rs 6,200 crore as against Rs 5,000 crore as per RBI Draft Reconstruction Scheme 2020.

As per the contours of the scheme, ICICI Bank (Rs 1,000 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 600 crore), Kotak Mahindra Bank (Rs 500 crore), Bandhan Bank (Rs 300 crore), Federal Bank (Rs 300 crore) and HDFC (Rs 1,000 crore) will infuse Rs 3,700 crore as equity into the crisis-hit Yes Bank. State Bank of India will invest Rs 7,250 crore for up to 26 percent stake with a lock-in of three years as against the earlier envisaged 49 percent stake.

It also announced the lifting of the moratorium by 6 pm on March 18 (from April 3 earlier), the third working day after the reconstruction scheme comes into force.

So, has the private sector lender turned a corner and more importantly has become an investment play? Market experts don't think so. They cited asset quality concerns, which could play spoilsport in the future. At best, they see it as a good trading play.

“The current moratorium on deposit withdrawal and capital infusion are just the first steps toward the revival of Yes Bank,"" Emkay Global said in a recent report, maintaining its sell call on the private sector lender. The brokerage sees many more such steps for a 'sustainable long term revival' of the bank to 'survive and thrive independently'.

Ajit Mishra, V-P Research, Religare Broking, too echoed the concern raised by Emkay. Mishra went a step further and advises investors to 'avoid' investing, especially when there are 'a list of quality banking names available at a good bargain'.

The government notified a rescue plan for Yes Bank, led by State Bank of India (SBI) and joined by other lenders, as it looked to shield the banking sector from a widespread crisis.

The so-called reconstruction scheme, cleared by the Union Cabinet, took effect on March 13. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) moratorium, imposing limits on withdrawals to prevent a run on deposits will be lifted in three working days, according to the notification.

""Moratorium on the bank to be lifted on the third working day at 18.00 hours (6 pm) from date of commencement of the scheme,"" it stated.

It has appointed Prashant Kumar as the CEO and MD of the reconstructed Yes Bank. Kumar is the former CFO and Deputy MD of State Bank of India (SBI) and was appointed Administrator to the troubled lender by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

He will vacate office as Administrator within seven calendar days from cessation of the moratorium.

Former Non-Executive Chairman of Punjab National Bank Sunil Mehta is appointed as Non- Executive Chairman. Mahesh Krishnamurthy and Atul Bheda are Non-Executive Directors. The new board is also to be formed within seven days from cessation of the moratorium.

Further, the notification states ""the investor bank (SBI) shall nominate two more officers as Directors to the new board and the RBI may appoint one or more additional directors as necessary.”

The new board may co-opt more directors to it as permitted under Articles of Associated. Members of the board, except additional directors, are to continue in office for one year or until an alternate board is constituted by the reconstructed bank.

Shareholding pattern

Existing shareholders holding over 100 shares in Yes Bank are subject to a three-year 'lock-in' for 75 percent of their investment.

The authorised share capital is to be altered to Rs 6,200 crore and the number of equity shares is to be altered to Rs 3,000 crore of Rs 2 each. The authorised preference share capital will continue to be Rs 200 crore. Investors are to be allotted shares on the reconstructed bank at Rs 10/share: per the notification.

For primary investor SBI, the post-infusion equity capital is “not be less than 26 percent and not more than 49 percent of total equity.” It is also to “not reduce its equity stake below 26 percent before completion of three years.”

The notification states that an investor, other than the investor bank (SBI), “may exercise voting rights to the extent of its shareholding, or 9 percent of the total voting rights of all the shareholders of the reconstructed bank, or as may be decided by the RBI—whichever is lower.”

Investors deemed ‘fit and proper’ to hold voting rights in excess of 9 percent by the RBI may be permitted to “exercise voting rights to the extent of its shareholding or up to 15 percent of the total voting rights of all equity shareholders of the reconstructed bank—whichever is less.”

Non-SBI investors also have a three-year ‘lock-in’ for 75 percent of their investment.

Investor bank and the investors are to be treated as ""public shareholders"" of the reconstructed bank for five years. They will “not be liable to pay capital gains tax for any deemed profits or gains on account of the subscription.”

Rights & liabilities of new board

The notification also clarified that ""all existing contracts, agreements, etc., will continue as before the reconstruction scheme. The deposits and liabilities, liabilities and obligations of creditors will also continue as before.""

""All employees to continue to be employees of the reconstructed bank on the same terms and conditions for a minimum of a year,"" it stated, adding that the board of directors may discontinue services of key managerial personnel ""as deemed necessary"".

The lifting of the moratorium is in line with what Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had stated on March 13 in regards to the moratorium on Yes Bank.

The notification has to this effect stated: ""The order of moratorium on the reconstructed bank issued by the Government of India in the Ministry of Finance, Department of Financial Services dated March 5, 2020, shall cease to have an effect."""

The Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) Group and Kotak Mahindra Prime are reportedly set to join the State Bank of India-led consortium to bail out troubled private lender Yes Bank.

The trio may buy shares at Rs 10 each and will jointly invest Rs 6,450 crore in the first tranche, Mint reported.

The draft recapitalisation plan by SBI envisions Rs 20,000 crore capital raise for Yes Bank over the next six months, to be infused in stages. It was submitted to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Centre on March 11, sources told the paper.

While mortgage lender HDFC and auto financier Kotak Mahindra Prime (a subsidiary of Kotak Mahindra Bank) will invest Rs 2,000 crore each, SBI will put in Rs 2,450 crore in round one. In round two, existing capital from Yes Bank will be used to build equity of Rs 10,000 crore, sources added.

Once the Rs 10,000 crore is raised, private equity (PE) firms will also be tapped for the remaining Rs 10,000 crore, they said.

The central bank looking for the maximum number of investors is a part of the consortium to ensure that no single entity/individual (other than the SBI) holds more than 5 percent stake in the troubled bank, TOI reported.

The government is keen on involving PE to keep the ‘nationalisation’ tag away from the Yes Bank rescue as most public sector banks (PSBs) are in capital conservation mode.

However, global PE players have laid out important conditions, the Business Standard reported. JC Flowers, Cerberus Capital, Tilden Park Capital and Blackstone want SBI to completely write down Yes Bank’s Tier II bonds as a part of the liability clean up.

As per the report, they want SBI to identify all stressed loan accounts and sell them to an asset reconstruction company (ARC). PEs are willing to invest up to $1.7 billion in Yes Bank but on similar terms that were offered to SBI, i.e. at Rs 10 per share.

“SBI will not want its stake in Yes Bank to go beyond 49 percent even though it has to bridge the gap between the required equity and what is eventually raised,” a source told the Economic Times.

The RBI proposed a revival plan for Yes Bank that would include initial capital infusion and funding lines to prevent a relapse once the 30-day moratorium imposed on March 5 is lifted. As per the plan, investors in additional Tier I (AT1) bonds have agreed to write-off 80 percent of their investment and convert 20 percent to equity, the TOI reported.

The central bank is expected to announce finalised commitments from SBI and other banks such as HDFC Group, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Group – who are in talks for equity investment - as soon as the banks confirm their investment.

As per the plan, once the announcement is made, banks will infuse Rs 20,000 crore as equity on day 2; public sector banks will invest around Rs 30,000 crore in certificates of deposits (CDs) of the bank on day 3, and the moratorium will be lifted on day 4, the TOI report stated.

The AT1 bondholders have Rs 8,500 crore investment Yes Bank, which will be converted into 170 crore equity shares with a face value Rs 10. This means an investment of Rs 1,700 crore with a three-year lock-in. The one sticky point would come from mutual fund houses (MFs) that hold AT1 bonds in pure debt funds as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) restricts equity investments by funds.

The central bank is looking for the maximum number of investors are part of the consortium to ensure that no single entity/individual (other than the State Bank of India) holds more than 5 percent stake in the troubled bank, TOI reported.

The government is keen on involving private equity (PE) to keep the ‘nationalisation’ tag away from the Yes Bank rescue as most public sector banks (PSBs) are in capital conservation mode.

However, global P/E players have laid out important conditions, reports Business Standard. JC Flowers, Cerberus Capital, Tiden Park Capital and Blackstone want SBI to completely write-down Yes Bank’s Tier II bonds as part of the liability clean up.

As per the report, they want SBI to identify all stressed loan accounts and sell them to an asset reconstruction company (ARC). PEs are willing to invest up to $1.7 billion in Yes Bank but on similar terms that were offered to SBI, i.e. at Rs 10 per share.

Rescue planThe RBI proposed a revival plan for Yes Bank that will include initial capital infusion and funding lines to prevent a relapse once the 30-day moratorium imposed on March 5 is lifted. As per the plan, investors in additional Tier I (AT1) bonds have agreed to write-off 80 percent of their investment and convert 20 percent to equity, the TOI report said.

The central bank is expected to announce finalised commitments from SBI and other banks such as HDFC Group, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Group – who are in talks for equity investment - as soon as the banks confirm their investment.

As per the plan, once the announcement is made, banks will infuse Rs 20,000 crore as equity on day 2; public sector banks will invest around Rs 30,000 crore in certificates of deposits (CDs) of the bank on day 3; and the moratorium will be lifted on day 4, the TOI report stated.

The AT1 bondholders have Rs 8,500 crore investment Yes Bank, which will be converted into 170 crore equity shares with a face value Rs 10. This means an investment of Rs 1,700 crore with a three-year lock-in. The one sticky point would come from mutual fund houses (MFs) that hold AT1 bonds in pure debt funds as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) restricts equity investments by funds."

The country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on Wednesday said it has reduced its marginal cost of fund-based lending rate (MCLR) by up to 15 basis points across various tenors, effective March 10.

The bank has reduced its one-year MCLR by 10 basis points to 7.75 percent from 7.85 percent earlier, the SBI said.

This is 10th consecutive cut in MCLR by the bank in the current fiscal.

Overnight and one-month MCLRs have been reduced by 15 basis points to 7.45 percent each. Three-month MCLR has been revised to 7.50 percent from 7.65 percent.

The new two-year and three-year MCLRs stand reduced by 10 basis points to 7.95 percent and 8.05 percent, respectively.

On Monday, another state-run lender Union Bank of India had announced cut in its MCLR by 10 basis points across all tenors, effective March 11.

This is the ninth consecutive rate cut announced by the Mumbai-based bank, since July 2019.

The bank has cut its one-year MCLR to 8 percent from 8.10 percent. The overnight MCLR has been revised to 7.55 percent, while the new one month rate stands at 7.60 percent, the bank had said."

When RBI imposed a moratorium on Yes Bank, it led to widespread panic in the financial ecosystem. But when it became public that State Bank of India (SBI) has emerged as the white knight of the troubled private lender, it assuaged the concerns of investors as well as depositors.

In an interview with CNN-News18, Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI, explained how his bank is preparing the ground for Yes Bank's turnaround and the hurdles ahead.

Edited excerpts:

Q: How is the hunt for investors (for Yes Bank) going? Is SBI's presence giving investors confidence?

A: There's a very good response and all the ends are being tied...We will tell RBI soon that these are the people who are willing to invest along with us. RBI has to decide who will be the other co-investor.

Q: As part of the scheme, Yes Bank won't be merged with SBI. Will you be open for any eventuality where Yes Bank is merged with other bank?

A: We have not given a thought to it. There were efforts last year (of private bank acquiring it). The size of Yes Bank is fairly large. Except for HDFC Bank, it is very difficult for any other bank to acquire it.

SBI won't have any hesitation if any bank wants to acquire Yes Bank on the basis of RBI guidelines. SBI will always ensure that the bank is stable and depositors feel their money is safe...

Q: You once said that Uday Kotak is best suited to acquire Yes Bank. Is it right that Kotak Mahindra Bank bank did not acquire Yes Bank due to high-level of NPAs?

A: That was a light-hearted remark of mine to Uday Kotak in a panel discussion. Don't take that remark too seriously.

Q: What is the expected timeline SBI has set to revive Yes Bank?

A: We are working on recapitalisation now. We will notify RBI with our required investment with co investors. When moratorium is lifted and new management takes over, they will further evaluate situation.

Q: How is SBI planning to go about in resusciating Yes Bank ?

A: A bank which has more than 1,100 branches, there will always be a control premium. There are various considerations on whch these things are decided.

Q: When the regulator has decided to write down 81 bond holders worth nearly 10,000 cr, why is it writing down the equity capital? Does it look ethically wrong?

A: I can't comment because it is in tte regulatory domain. The depositors need not worry. The board and managemeny will work towards resolving the issue.

Q: Why did you restrict SBI's ownership to just 49 percent?

A: We don't want 51% stake or want it to be a subsidary. Our intention is to give confidence to depositors. A credible name like SBI supporting Yes Bank is the need of the hour.

Q: What is the estimated level of NPAs? Rumours doing rounds peg it at more than Rs 50,000 cr?

A: Yes Bank is announcing its results on 14th March.

Q: Is SBI roping in investors who are willing to acquire more than 5 percent stake in Yes Bank?

A: It is not in our hands. We will give the list to RBI and they will then decide."

The ongoing crisis at Yes Bank has the potential to trigger a domino effect in Indian financial markets, and the job of markets regulator SEBI is no less daunting.

One tricky issue arising out of the Yes Bank episode is how to avoid a potential conflict of interest when State Bank of India (SBI) acquires 49 percent stake in the troubled private lender.

In that scenario, SBI becomes the main promoter of Yes Bank, which in turn, holds a majority stake in Yes AMC.

And, that is where the problem lies.

SEBI regulations do not explicitly limit one AMC per sponsor but they do mention avoidance of conflict of interest situation, according to a former SEBI officer who worked in its MF department.

""SBI is set to become de-facto sponsor of two mutual funds - SBI MF and Yes MF - which creates a prima facie conflict of interest situation,"" said the former SEBI officer.

SBI MF presently is in numero uno spot with AUM of RS 3.80 lakh crore as of January 31, 2020, while Yes AMC had AUM of Rs 400 crore.

On March 6, the government launched a rescue plan for Yes Bank under which the State Bank of India (SBI) will pick a 49 percent stake as part of a restructuring proposal.

On March 5, SBI said its board had given in-principle approval to explore an investment in Yes Bank. Earlier that day, in a sudden move, the RBI took control of Yes Bank and limited withdrawals.

RBI restricted withdrawals that customers can make from their YES Bank accounts to Rs 50,000 until April 3, 2020.

The moratorium comes after the Rana Kapoor-promoted bank failed to raise capital to address potential loan losses and in the wake of deteriorating financials of the bank.

SEBI Directions

In 2010, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had asked France-based firm BNP Paribas for details on how it intends to continue its mutual fund (MF) business in India as BNP Paribas owned Fortis Mutual Fund and also held a stake in Sundaram BNP Paribas Asset Management.

SEBI had asked BNP Paribas to choose either or merge the two, as regulations do not permit an entity from having stakes in two asset management companies.

It remains a conjecture how SBI would approach its overall handling of being a parent to two MFs simultaneously. Will SBI approach SEBI with a merger proposal of Yes AMC with SBI AMC remains to be seen, fund experts said."

Investors have total bets of over Rs 93,000 crore on the additional tier-I bonds in Indian banks and a complete write-down proposed in the Yes Bank restructuring may lead to risk aversion, according to a report by domestic rating agency ICRA.

The report comes two days after IndusInd Bank virtually dropped a plan for the issue of the AT-1 bonds by deferring a board meet following the Yes Bank package by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), implementation of which is set to erode investments.

As part of the SBI-led restructuring package announced by the RBI, there is a proposal to write down the entire outstanding on AT-1 bonds, which has been pegged at Rs 8,695 crore by ICRA on March 9.

Investors have reportedly approached the banking regulator seeking help.

The proposal is ""likely to further increase the risk aversion of investors as the investors will factor in a higher probability of write-downs on these bonds"", ICRA said in the report.

Appetite for future issuances and also the investor base for future issuances will take a beating because of the move, it said.

A total of Rs 93,669 crore of AT-1 bonds is outstanding as on date (Rs 84,574 excluding Yes Bank), of which Rs 39,315 crore will be in private banks (Rs 30,620 crore excluding Yes Bank).

The largest outstanding is with SBI at Rs 27,432 crore, followed by ICICI Bank at Rs 10,120 crore, while the immediate call option is coming up for Bank of Baroda on a Rs 400 crore bond, it said.

Most of these bonds were issued in 2016-17 and 2017-18 with first call option after fifth year from issuance, which means large bonds are due for call in 2021-22 and 2022-23.

The reduction in the risk appetite for investors will be constraining banks from rolling over these bonds by exercising call option and fresh issuance, it said.

In such an event, and also the absence of fresh issuances, the capital buffers over regulatory levels will decline by an estimated 1 per cent of risk-weighted assets, it said.

The agency added that under the large exposure framework, exposure to single borrower or group of borrowers is linked to tier-1 capital, and reduction in tier-1 capital upon redemption of these bonds will also reduce the ability of the banks to take large exposures to a borrower group."

SBI, which needs to raise around Rs 20,000 crore for Yes Bank, is also in talks with JC Flowers, Tilden Park Capital Management and Cerebrus Capital, the report said. JC Flowers and Tilden Park had submitted non-binding expressions of interest to Yes Bank’s previous management.

The government placed a 30-day moratorium on Yes Bank on March 5. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took over the lender’s board and placed a Rs 50,000 withdrawal limit on depositors.

On March 6, the banking regulator announced a draft reconstruction for the private sector lender.

State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar on March 7 stated that the bank has set an upper cap of Rs 10,000 crore for investment in Yes Bank.

Clarifying that there will ""no merger"" Kumar emphasised that 26 percent stake is the ""lock-in requirement"" and thus obligatory, adding that 49 percent is the upper limit approved by the bank board ""in-principal"".

""Only requirement is the lock of 26 percent for three years, This sets the boundary. This is obligation, anything above that would be requirement and would depend on what others invest,"" he said.

He further said that the moratorium period could be shorter. ""Believe Yes Bank can be quickly brought out of RBI administration. Prashant Kumar is one of the most competent banking professionals,"" he added.

""Once Yes Bank is out of moratorium, it will be run by a professional team. The intention is not to get involved in day-to-day functioning. Yes Bank can be quickly brought out of RBI administration and once this is done, SBI will keep it at not one, but two-arms length,"" he added.

Acknowledging that the bank has stepped in many times to act as a troubleshooter, Kumar said Yes Bank's survival is important to contain contagion and it needs a credible investor for successful resolution.

""The final board approved scheme will be announced to the exchanges. Out investment team is working on assessing the balance sheet of Yes Bank. We will work overtime, 24x7, to ensure the resolution plan is approved and implemented much before the 30-day timeline,"" he added.

Speaking on the quantum of investment, Kumar refused to confirm stating that the bank has received the RBI draft plan and its internal investment and legal teams are doing due diligence, after which the bank will respond to RBI with its comments on March 9.

He however added: ""RBI will increased authorised equity shares to 2,400 crore for face value of Rs 2 each, which brings the authorised capital to 4,800 crore. If we presume that SBI takes on 49 percent stake that would be 245 crore shares at Rs 10, which would put immediate investment requirement at Rs 2,450 crore.""

Kumar also sought to assure investors and depositors, stating that there would be no conflict of interest and that the moratorium limit of Rs 50,000 withdrawal is a short-term pain, while customers money is ""completely safe"". ""Depositors money is not at all at risk. Whatever is proposed, interest of SBI shareholders will not be compromised,"" he added.

On the other investors, Kumar said they expect many co-investors for Yes Bank. ""Investors are seeing an opportunity here. We have reached out to investors and these are initial talks. Teams will reach out to investors and apply to RBI for their nod,"" he said. He however refused to give a count of the potential investors."

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is preparing to offer a special liquidity window for Yes Bank as urgent financial support to the troubled private sector lender and soothe the frayed nerves of depositors, three government sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Moneycontrol.

""Considering the peculiar circumstances surrounding this case, the RBI is likely to extend a short-term loan/line of credit to Yes Bank of around Rs 8,000-Rs 10,000 crore to reduce panic among depositors and ensure sufficient funds for permitted withdrawals,"" said one source. ""As it is a special case, the interest component will be lesser and final touches are being given to this plan,"" they added.

Offering liquidity to a distressed entity, though extremely rare, is permissible under Section 17 of the RBI Act, according to two of the sources. All the three people Moneycontrol spoke to did not want to be named.

Another source said this is the banker’s bank concept and as a central bank, the RBI can take this step under exceptional circumstances. “This not to be confused with negotiations on picking up an equity stake in Yes Bank which are happening simultaneously.”

On Friday, the government launched a rescue plan for Yes Bank under which the State Bank of India (SBI) will pick a 49 percent stake as part of as restructuring proposal. RBI said it had increased Yes Bank's authorised share capital, paving the way for infusion of cash by SBI, India’s largest lender.

Banking analysts who parsed through RBI’s statement estimated that SBI is due to invest about Rs 2,450 crore. But there was no clarity on the cash infusion or details about the final investor for Yes Bank, whose finances have severely deteriorated under a pile of bad loans.

India’s fifth biggest private lender badly needs funds after struggling for months to raise $2 billion. Analysts said Yes Bank requires much more capital than what SBI might invest.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters the restructuring proposal would be implemented within 30 days.

On March 5, SBI said its board had given an in-principle approval to explore an investment in Yes Bank. Earlier that day, in a sudden move, the RBI took control of Yes Bank and limited withdrawals.

""The financial position of Yes Bank has undergone a steady decline largely due to inability of the bank to raise capital to address potential loan losses and resultant downgrades,"" RBI said."

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) Chairman Deepak Parekh termed panic in the market over Yes Bank as ‘unnecessary and an overreaction’.

“The public is reacting as if this is the end of the world. It is a temporary overreaction, which is unnecessary. Panic in the market to the moratorium is completely an overreaction,” Parekh told CNBC-TV18.

He said the problem is bank-specific and not sectoral.

Stating that our financial system is strong, he said, “One company going under or having temporary problems due to lack of capital cannot destroy the system.”

He added that RBI has taken a timely call and that the central bank has the right to 'do whatever it needs to protect depositors'. “RBI has taken a timely call with this move. If they (RBI) had waited till March 14, there would have been a run on the bank. The bank (Yes Bank) needs capital and needs it as soon as possible. There could be a rights issue where some of us may be asked to participate,” he noted.

Allaying concerns as to why the process is taking so long, Parekh said, ""If SBI needs to put in equity in Yes Bank, they need a few days for approvals. If SBI invites other investors, I am sure other banks will join in to protect the financial system. All plans are still being worked out ""

Explaining the rationale of State Bank of India (SBI) participation, Parekh said: “Large number of foreign funds have discussed various options with RBI. Most of these investors are prominent international players that do not have any investment in India. RBI may have needed comfort of an institution like SBI.”

When asked if he was aware of any private player participating in the Yes Bank investment process, he said, “Initially it is SBI's call, if they need anyone to participate they will ask.”

The veteran banker felt panicking depositors had no reason to worry. “I am convinced that Yes Bank depositors will get all their money bank.""

He also allayed depositors' fears with regards to the security of their deposits in case of a merger, saying: ""The government wants to run Yes Bank as an independent entity. It is better to run Yes Bank independently and revive it.""

However, he felt that the bank's depositors should have conducted proper due diligence while investing their money. ""IL&FS was not an accident, but a disaster waiting to happen. Even Yes Bank was a disaster waiting to happen. It was known that the bank's loans would not come back. Yes Bank could have turned around themselves, but now a drastic steps had to be taken by RBI. People should take precaution investing in such companies,"" he said."

The fall of India’s fifth-largest private bank, Yes Bank, is a text book study of how banking and financial sector loopholes are still used with impunity by promoters to give short shrift to the gullible public. It continues to be on the case study track over how the watchdog institutions and agencies are quick to bail out the real culprits, no matter what it means to the small stakeholder.

The latest in a series of bank meltdowns provides gaping holes in the way corporate governance is practised in India, where the retail investor or client gets the least priority. Culpable by their decision to remain inactive is the board of directors who never thought it necessary to blow the whistle while the big investors withdrew huge chunks of money, before the apex bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), superseded the Yes Bank board and imposed a Rs 50,000 withdrawal cap from March 5 to April 3.

Surely, nobody can deny multiple-level failures by institutions such as the RBI and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the ordained watch dogs which keep failing again and again, no doubt due to external compulsions — some allegedly even from government authorities.

The one-month moratorium complete with a withdrawal ceiling of Rs 50,000 per account can at best be described as a band-aid to stem a cerebral haemorrhage. This is because there may be quantity here, but no real quality in terms of actual funds in terms of deposit base, which stand completely denuded. This is just as the case with bank’s shares systematically unloaded by big players and picked up by the gullible retail investors.

Consider what has actually transpired in the past few months:

The deposit base and net worth of the bank, whose deposit base stood in excess of Rs 2 lakh crore till the latter part of September 2019 has got wiped out in 4-5 months.

The combined message of the beleaguered bank’s board being superseded by the RBI and the government diktat to the State Bank of India (SBI) and the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) to clean up the muck and carry Yes Bank’s sizeable liability mess has led to a bloodbath both in the BSE and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

It’s not just the stocks of Yes Bank and the SBI, but all banks that are taking the beating. This at a time when global markets are going into a tailspin because of the COVID-19 outbreak.

By getting the SBI along with the government’s favourite milch cow, the LIC, in tow, to pick up a controlling stake of the embattled bank, the finance ministry is sending out a wrong signal.

The buzz about 49 percent stake in the bank will change hands via sale of preferential shares at Rs 2 to SBI-LIC is reinforced by JP Morgan slashing the bank’s target price from Rs 55 to Re 1.

Thus, the controlling stake will change hands at less than Rs 500 crore even as some of the major single company exposures by way of secured debt run into thousands of crores.

This is only the beginning as apart from the SBI and the LIC buying stake, there could be massive infusion of public money to bail out the capital-eroded Yes Bank. Given this, isn’t it an irony that most banking sector pundits keep pointing the finger at the co-operative banking sector for everything that ails the banking and finance sector?

Sure, the cooperative banks were quite arbitrary and paid no heed to rules and regulations while parking funds in what they thought were money-spinning options. No doubt the promoter-directors were driven by plain greed, but they were also under pressure from investors to pay far from realistic interest rates.

If the trigger was Madhavpura Mercantile Cooperative Bank going belly-up after playing the markets mostly through Ketan Parekh, there was no segregation between those with big and small deposits. They all got wiped out, unlike what has happened in the case of Yes Bank and a few other scheduled banks earlier, the PMC Bank being a recent case.

There were continuous runs on many cooperative banks across Gujarat in 2001 before the RBI stepped in. Nowadays, the apex bank steps in early and ensures there is no negative optics by way of run on banks. So, what if a lion’s share of the deposits has already been withdrawn discretely, without the retail depositor getting a whiff of what was cooking!

Now comes the heartburn of the middle class, stoically trying to make ends meet, honour commitments such as paying fees of children, getting them married, meeting medical emergencies and even holding funerals. Many of them who have accounts in Yes Bank will have to adjust with Rs 50,000 over the next one month.

The travesty of justice is this is being done in the name of protecting the interests of the hapless small savings account holder. However, the big institutional players, the PEs and fund managers will once again go scot-free. Not that it will be anything new for either of the two as the LIC is already holding close to 10 percent of Yes Bank’s shares under its various schemes.

A day after the RBI superseded the board of India's fourth-largest private sector lender Yes Bank, State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Friday said the problem at hand is lender-specific and not sectoral. On March 5, the SBI board gave its ""in-principle"" approval to exploring investment opportunities in Yes Bank.

""The RBI has said they will come out with a restructuring plan (for Yes Bank),"" Kumar told reporters after meeting Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

The resolution will come ""very shortly,"" he said without elaborating.

The Reserve Bank on March 5 placed Yes Bank under a moratorium and imposed limits on withdrawals.

""This is not a sectoral problem. It is a bank-specific problem,"" he said. ""The RBI will take all steps to ensure financial stability.""

On SBI picking up a stake in Yes Bank, he said the lender already has an in-principle approval for doing so.

""If SBI has to pick up a stake in Yes Bank, we have an in-principle approval for that,"" he said.

The RBI has capped withdrawals from Yes Bank at Rs 50,000 for the next one month and imposed strict limits on operations after the cash-starved lender faced ""regular outflow of liquidity"" after an effort to raise new capital failed."

Private lender Yes Bank’s collapse marks the first such instance involving a new-age private sector lender. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), already facing criticism on major supervision lapses in cases like Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC), couldn’t have afforded Yes Bank to fail. For months, just like the bank's shareholders, the central bank too waited for an investor to turn up to rescue the bank. But, that didn't happen, forcing regulatory clampdown on the lender.

As of now, Yes Bank is placed under a 30-day moratorium and it’s board has been superseded by the central bank. Restrictions have been placed on its operations. RBI has appointed Prashant Kumar, former CFO of State Bank of India, as caretaker administrator of Yes Bank, under Section 36ACA (2) of the Act. Depositors can withdraw up to Rs 50,000 till the moratorium period ends on April 3.

The SBI board has also given an ‘in-principle’ approval to invest in the capital-starved Yes Bank.

To catch all live updates on this developing story, click here....

Yes Bank's rise and fallYes Bank was granted a banking licence in 2003-04 along with Kotak Mahindra Bank. Rana Kapoor, a veteran banker who was previously with Rabo Bank, built the bank stating that the bank will offer the best quality banking experience to customers, who till then had limited options between old generation private banks and government-owned banks that controlled majority of the banking space.

Kapoor held 26 percent stake in Yes Bank while Rabobank International held 20 percent stake. The bank's growth over the years was quick. In the next 10 years, it emerged one of the top five private banks in India.

The events at Yes Bank that led to its fall point to serious lapses in the way risk management systems are designed in the Indian banking system and RBI's shortcomings as a supervision authority.

The RBI prevented further damage in Yes Bank by declining another term to Kapoor as MD and CEO in September 2018. It allowed Kapoor to continue only till January 31, 2019 after unearthing major corporate governance issues.

It shows that promoter-driven banks needs special regulatory focus and corporate governance loopholes need to be plugged. The story also throws up a major cautionary lesson to other private banks that mere focus on technology and chasing high growth in relying on corporate banking and wholesale deposits to boost balance sheet won't work. The golden rule of prudential lending and high corporate governance are vital for any bank's survival.

As far as customer is concerned, Yes Bank is yet another blow on the Indian banking sector. This is the second major instance of RBI superseding a major bank within a span of one year. In September last year, RBI had superseded Maharashtra-based PMC Bank following major financial irregularities.

With Yes Bank under RBI's closer watch now and deposit withdrawal restricted to Rs 50,000 per person, customers will turn even more risk averse.

Did RBI act too late?One of the key takeaways from the Yes Bank episode is that RBI acted late. It had appointed R Gandhi to its board with effect from May 14, 2019. This was after Yes Bank reported a Rs 1,507 crore loss in Q4 FY19 and rating agencies ICRA and India Ratings downgraded its long-term ratings. The RBI action was also on account of serious corporate governance issues under Kapoor and enough warning signals of its deteriorating financials.

Despite an RBI nominee on the board, why didn’t the central bank act earlier to address the fault lines within the bank? If it had taken preventive measures, perhaps significant erosion in bank’s financials could have been avoided and made the terms of the rescue much less painful.

Remember, the corporate governance issues within the bank gradually eroded investor trust in the bank. Cracks began to appear in Yes Bank’s balance sheets long back when the RBI identified major divergence in the reported non-performing asset numbers and the actual bad loan figures. In FY19 alone, it reported a divergence of Rs 3,277 crore in bad loans and Rs 978 crore in NPA provisions. The financial ratios were deteriorating in the subsequent years.

In the following period, Yes Bank witnessed severe corporate governance issues, which is a major part of allegations in the whistleblower letter of Yes Bank's independent director Uttam Prakash Agarwal who resigned in January citing 'serious concerns' on the state of affairs at the private sector lender and deteriorating practices.

The government can’t afford a bank failure. Yes Bank is likely to be bailed by SBI in the next few weeks. But, here again, the taxpayers’ money is used to bail out a business failure that too on account of serious corporate governance rule violations.

With the impasse at Yes Bank and deposit withdrawal restrictions, the trust deficit that already exists in the system is likely to get widened. The central bank has a lot of explaining to do on prolonging the crisis to this stage."

Any withdrawal over the amount will require the permission of the Reserve Bank of India.

The moratorium will be applicable from 6:00 pm on March 5 to April 3, 2020.

The bank will not be allowed to pay depositors a sum exceeding Rs.50,000/- lying in any savings, current or any other deposit account, the government said in a notification.

The restrictions in the withdrawal of deposits will be subject to certain conditions. RBI may, by a general or special order, permit the bank to allow withdrawal of over Rs 50,000 in the following unforeseen circumstances:

- in connection with the medical treatment of the depositor or any person actually dependent on him;

- towards the cost of higher education of the depositor or any person actually dependent on him for education in India or outside India;

- to pay obligatory expenses in connection with marriage or other ceremonies of the depositor or his children or of any other person actually dependent upon him;

- in connection with any other unavoidable emergency.

In a press release, the RBI said, the financial position of Yes Bank has undergone a steady decline largely due to inability of the bank to raise capital to address potential loan losses and resultant downgrades, triggering invocation of bond covenants by investors, and withdrawal of deposits. The bank has also experienced serious governance issues and practices in recent years, which have led to a steady decline of the bank.

RBI said it has been constantly engaging with the bank’s management to find ways to strengthen its balance sheet and liquidity and the management had indicated that various investors had been approached and were likely to come on board.

However, in the absence of a credible revival, the central bank said, it has come to the conclusion that, in the interest of the bank’s depositors, it had no alternative but to apply to the Central Government for imposing a moratorium under section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

Accordingly, the Central Government has imposed moratorium effective from today, restricting the withdrawal of deposits to Rs 50,000, RBI said in the release."

The government has reportedly approved State Bank of India's (SBI) plan to lead a consortium and purchase stake in YES Bank, as per a Bloomberg report.

Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has been approached to join a consortium, which includes State Bank of India (SBI), to buy a stake in YES Bank, sources told Moneycontrol.

Following the report, shares of YES Bank climbed as much as 29 percent intraday on March 5, while those of SBI fell nearly 5 percent. However, the scrip was able to recover losses and ended the day with gains of over a percent.

It also inspired a wide range of reactions from Twitter - some of whom applauded the move, while others questioned substantiality of the investment.

For months, reports of an investor in sight for beleaguered private lender Yes Bank have received much ink. Yes Bank, India’s fifth-largest private lender, has been trying in vain to raise Rs 14,000 crore in fresh capital.

In January, the bank said it rejected a proposal from Canadian investor Erwin Singh Braich and Hong Kong-based SPGP Holdings to invest $1.2 billion. Few analysts were surprised by the outcome because the offer was suspect.

The bank then said it was considering offers of investment from London-based Citax Holdings and Citax Investment Group. But that deal too didn’t fructify.

Time was fast running out for the bank, which has been beset by a pile of bad loans due to its exposure to a bunch of troubled sectors.

The high drama surrounding the survival of Yes Bank could finally be coming to an end. According to a Bloomberg report, the Narendra Modi-government has asked State Bank of India (SBI) to bail out Yes Bank by forming a consortium of banks.

Yes Bank said it has not received any such communication from the Reserve Bank of India or any other government or regulatory authorities or from the SBI and we are unaware of any such decision. “The Bank in the usual and ordinary course of its business continues to explore various means of raising capital/ funds through issuance of securities to diverse set of investors to meet its business/ regulatory requirements, subject to compliance with prescribed procedures and receipt of statutory/ regulatory approvals,” Yes bank said.

How did the bank survive through these months of uncertainty?

“The mood was of desperation and the only thing that kept things going in Yes Bank was hope,” recounted a person who was closely associated with the crisis. “Since January, there was a sense of resignation internally. No one knew where things are heading to,” the person said.

It wasn’t always so. There was hope in the bank management of finding investors in the first six months after new CEO Ravneet Gill took charge. But the cheer began fading after investors, who initially appeared willing to put money on the table, turned wary due to the worsening finances and corporate governance issues.

“Only question that remained to be seen was whether the bank will still retain its identity after the takeover or will cease to exist as we know it today,” the person quoted above said.

Curtains down, finally

Asking SBI to bail out Yes Bank is not without precedent. In 2004, the erstwhile Global Trust Bank was merged with Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC).

There have also been other distress takeovers involving private lenders. In 2006, the erstwhile United Western Bank merged with IDBI and in 2010, Bank of Rajasthan merged with ICICI Bank. But what makes Yes Bank case an exception is the size of the stressed assets involved. According to rating agency Moody's, the bank's total dud assets are likely to cross 12 percent this year.

More than 40 percent of its Rs 30,000 crore of exposure to lower-rated entities are likely to turn sticky before March. Last month, for the second time in two months, India Ratings downgraded long-term issuer rating on certain debt instruments of Yes Bank to 'A-' from 'A' and also maintained it on the rating watch 'negative'.

Banks such as Kotak Mahindra were initially rumoured to be potential acquirers but given the stress on its books, suitors disappeared. A government-bank led bailout was the only remaining option.

More than meets the eye?

Doubts have also been cast on the value of the stressed assets. “The rumour is that the actual stress is significantly bigger than what is speculated,” said Naresh Malhotra, a banking consultant based in Mumbai and a former SBI official.

A clearer picture of the bank’s troubled assets will emerge when Yes Bank announces its third-quarter results on March 14. The bank might not announce the results if the reported merger proposal with SBI turns official by then.

Analysts said Yes Bank is part of a grouping of banks whose stressed assets will increase in the third quarter by the addition of exposure to struggling businesses such as DHFL, Suzlon and Altico. Under RBI norms, banks must set aside money against doubtful assets.

The quantum of such provisions depends on how bad is the asset. Yes Bank is a corporate lender, with this segment constituting about 62 percent of the total loan book. Retail loans constitute just about 20 percent.

How the drama unfolded

During its golden days, Yes Bank was an object of envy for most competitors. It was even billed as the next HDFC Bank by a section of analysts. Successive quarters of 30 percent-plus growth and a booming corporate loan book made it an investor’s darling.

“But even then there were murmurs about the kind of growth and exposure in Yes Bank,” said Vaibhav Agarwal, senior vice-president, research at Angel Broking.

Cracks first appeared on the books of the bank when the RBI found a huge divergence in bad loan figures reported by the bank and what emerged in its inspection. In FY19 alone, Yes Bank reported a divergence of Rs 3,277 crore in bad loans and Rs 978 crore in non-performing asset (NPA) provisions.

Since then, the bank has been struggling to raise funds despite repeated commitments made by Gill to shareholders.

After equating his holding in the bank to ""Diamonds that are forever"", in November last year, Yes Bank's founder Rana Kapoor sold almost all of his stake in the bank. The resignation of Yes Bank's independent director Uttam Prakash Agarwal in January, citing ""serious concerns"" on the state of affairs at the private sector lender and deteriorating practices, further scared investors, who dumped the shares.

Yes Bank, which had earlier guided the markets with a Rs 14,000 crore fund-raising plan, in early January, said it will raise Rs 10,000 crore and called an EGM on February 7 to seek shareholders’ nod to raise its authorised capital. Analysts raised eyebrows on the repeated breach of commitment post guidance.

“We stopped tracking the stock a while ago. No client wants to touch a stock with these kinds of issues,” said a Mumbai-based analyst on condition of anonymity.

As on date, Yes Bank’s market capitalisation is just over Rs 9,500 crore. That is a shadow of the amount — Rs 14,000 crore — that it initially forecast to raise from the market to stay afloat.

What’s in it for SBI?

For SBI, there is nothing much to cheer about the Yes bank deal. To be sure, this is unlikely to have a direct impact on SBI’s books as the bank is expected to only facilitate the deal instead of taking up the majority stress on its books, bankers said. “SBI has been pressured to do this. Given an option, they wouldn’t have touched a bank like Yes,” Malhotra said.

Still, given the kind of stressed assets, including the speculated hidden assets, on Yes Bank’s books, it is a risky bet for SBI. Even in a consortium format, SBI will have to pool in significant amount of money to clean up the mess in Yes Bank.

“Ideally and theoretically speaking, SBI and other PSU banks need to buy the bank at Re 1,"" Macquarie analyst Suresh Ganapathy wrote in a note on Thursday commenting on the reports of Yes Bank’s takeover by SBI-led consortium.

""Yes Bank has a net worth of around Rs 25,000 crore. Its below investment grade book (BB&Below) is around Rs 30,000 crore and BBB book is at around Rs 50,000 crore. If we assume substantial proportion of BB&below book is wiped off and say 10-15 percent of BBB book is to be written off, it implies the current net worth of the bank is zero (after factoring in 25 percent tax benefits),” Ganapathy said.

SBI is getting a balance sheet with about Rs 30,000 crore loans are in the stressed category. The actual burden will be known when the full scale of Yes’ stressed assets is known by the acquirers."

According to Bloomberg, SBI has been asked by the government to form a consortium for stake purchase of the Yes Bank.

Commenting on the development, former IBA CEO VG Kannan told CNBC-TV18 that the stake purchase by SBI should not be seen as an acquisition but rather an investment.

Banking regulators won't allow substantial stake acquisition in another bank, he added.

The exchanges had sought a clarification from SBI and Yes Bank in the matter and the following is the response from the banks:

Yes Bank: ""In the said matter, we would like to clarify that as on date, the Bank has not received any such communication from RBI or any other the Government or Regulatory authorities or from the SBI and we are unaware of any such decision.""

SBI: ""We will abide by the timelines under Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations 2015 in disclosing the developments, if any in the matter to Stock Exchanges.

The subsidiary of India's largest lender, the State Bank of India (SBI), is aiming to raise Rs 10,355 crore through this IPO which will close on March 5.

The issue is priced at nearly 48 times the earnings per share (EPS) of the first half of FY20 (annualised) of Rs 15.6 and nearly 16 times book value of equity per share (BVPS). It does not have any listed peers on domestic stock exchanges.

As per the issue size, the SBI Card IPO will be the fifth-largest IPO of the country, preceded by the likes of Coal India, Reliance Power and ONGC.

Coal India's IPO, which came in 2010, tops the chart of the largest IPOs, with an issue size of Rs 15,475 crore. It was followed by Reliance Power IPO which came in 2008 with an issue size of Rs 11,700 crore.

General Insurance Corporation of India IPO is at the third spot. It came in 2017 with an issue size of Rs 11,372 crore. ONGC is at the fourth spot with an issue size of Rs 10,694 crore. ONGC IPO had come in 1996.

Size does not matter

The size of an IPO makes it attractive to some extent but a lot depends on how the company fares going forward. Data shows, some of the larger IPOs, with an issue size of over Rs 5,000 crore, failed to meet the expectations of investors in the long run with their current market price below their issue price.

SBI Card has fetched buy signals from analysts and brokerages, not because of its size, but because of its strong market position, revenue strength, improving profitability and stable asset quality.

""Over the long-term, we remain optimistic given SBI Card's strong market position, revenue strength, improving profitability and stable asset quality. Further, the macro traits are favourable in the domestic card industry with rising disposable income, increase in private consumption growth, young Indian population, surge in use of credit cards in personal spending and government’s support towards digital payment services,"" said Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research (Investment Services) and AVP Equity Research, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

For the short-term, despite a higher valuation, experts say the stock will give listing gains.

""SBI Card IPO is a much-anticipated one. Despite the IPO-valuation being rich, the stock is expected to give listing gains given the euphoria around it,"" said Raghav Garg, Research Analyst - NBFCs and Specialty Finance at Nirmal Bang.

In the long-term, Garg said the stock could continue to command rich multiple since it is the only pure-play cards company in India.

""The growth opportunity is also such that the company can thrive. But one may become more wary of valuations after listing gains,"" Garg said.

The challenges

From macroeconomic headwinds to the probability of any deterioration in asset quality, SBI card, too, will face challenges that will make its ride bumpy.

""Further economic downturn and increase in unemployment rates could throw up growth and asset quality challenges. MDR regulations is another angle one needs to consider as it would impact earnings should that risk materialize,"" Garg said.

Besides, the fact that the company’s card portfolio is largely unsecured is a risk. The emergence of a competition is also something that will test the strength of the company.

""The company’s card portfolio is largely unsecured without any collateral. While the company is maintaining steady asset quality, any potential prolonged weakness in the economy may affect its portfolio,"" Solanki of Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers said.

""Further, the increasingly competitive environment, along with the emergence of new or significantly larger credit card issuers or payment solutions providers, may pose a challenge to SBI Cards to retain its customer base. Additionally, the company may have to deal with any adverse regulatory change in the card industry,"" Solanki added.

Amid coronavirus fears, D-Street is gearing up for a historic event to unfold this week – the SBI Card IPO, which will open for subscription on March 2.

This will be the largest IPO after General Insurance Corporation of India which came out with its initial offering in October 2017.

SBI Card proposed to raise Rs 10,289 crore at the lower end of the price band (Rs 750 per share) and Rs 10,355 crore at the upper end (Rs 755 per share).

The next big question in the mind of investors is where should investors place their money – SBI that has a market capitalisation of Rs 2.7 lakh crore (as of February 28) or SBI Card IPO?

If one has to make a choice between the parent company, SBI and the SBI Card IPO, experts feel that investors will be better off investing in the IPO for both listing and long-term gains. The grey market premium is around 40 percent on the listing.

SBI Card (SBIC) is a subsidiary of State Bank of India, and is also the second-largest credit card issuer with 93.2 lakh outstanding credit cards and Rs 98,486 crore in terms of total credit card spends as on December 2019.

“We would advise investors to subscribe to the SBI Card IPO and earn from the listing gains. Since there is a lot of buzz around the IPO and it is already trading at a 40% premium in the grey market, a stellar opening is expected by D-Street,” Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities told Moneycontrol.

“Contrary to this, SBI Bank’s stock won’t deliver the same returns in such a short span of time. Hence, investors should play the SBI Card IPO and avoid the SBI stock which is trading in a range-bound manner,” he said.

One of the reasons, which experts feel, could play in favour of SBI Card is the low penetration of the credit card market. Compared to other markets, the Indian credit card market remains severely underpenetrated with a meagre 3% (per 100 population) penetration, which is among the lowest in the world, according to reports.

“Investors who had SBI shares in their portfolio as on February 18, 2020 – the record date for application under this criterion – can apply for the IPO under this category,” Atish Matlawala, Sr Analyst, SSJ Finance & Securities told Moneycontrol.

“Penetration of credit cards in India is just 3% compared to 73% in Brazil and 42% in China. This presents an immense opportunity for the entire industry to grow. Thus we will prefer investment in SBI card and not SBI at this point in time,” he said.

Earnings & Valuations:

SBI Cards has maintained a strong earnings trajectory with revenue growth at 44.6 percent CAGR to Rs 6,999 crore in 2017 and net profit trajectory at 52.1 percent CAGR to Rs 862.7 crore in 2019 with sustainable RoA of over 4 percent and RoE of about 28 percent, said an ICICIdirect report.

“SBI being Parent will be beneficiary of the IPO and its expected rich valuations. At IPO price it contributes Rs.40 per share (post 20% discount) to SBI’s valuation. SBI (bank) is expected to report strong earnings (~50% CAGR) over the next 2 years considering declining slippages and improving recoveries,” Pankaj Pandey, Head – Research, ICICI direct told Moneycontrol.

“Subsidiaries are adding to valuations further. We believe investment in SBI bank can be considered at current levels. SBI cards IPO should be subscribed for listing gains as valuation remain rich at 44x FY20E PAT IPO price,” he said.

Largest pure-play issuer:

SBIC has grown its business faster than the market over the past two years both in terms of the number of cards outstanding (35% CAGR over FY17-19) and card spends (54% CAGR), according to a Motilal Oswal report.

This helped in improving its market share to 18 percent in both the categories (as of November 2019). It offers a wide range of card portfolios (46) with 40 percent being the premium cards (2nd highest).

The working-age population, spend-thrift nature of the millennials, credit card penetration being low, government's thrust on digitalisation and a growing economy a are the major driving force for the credit card industry flourish in times to come, suggest experts.

No doubt SBIC commands higher valuations, but with strong financial metrics as well as rising market share, it becomes a value play for even long-term investors as well.

“SBI Cards is the first offering of its kind where the tailwinds is quite optimistic, financial metrics are quite strong and hence it warrants a significant listing premium and a high valuation,” Paras Bothra, President of Equity Research, Ashika Stock Broking told Moneycontrol.

“As SBI being the promoter to it and the lofty valuation which SBI Cards listing would command will certainly have a positive rub-off effect on SBI’ stocks price. Hence investors can consider applying for the SBI Cards IPO for good gains,” he said.

Being the largest financial conglomerate with businesses across segments like corporate, retail, government businesses, insurance, asset management, credit cards among others, SBI turns into a holding company and thus does not provide a pure-play.

“While the valuation may seem attractive from holding company perspective, we would prefer a pure-play with limited balance sheet risk like Life insurance business,” Sameer Kaul, MD & CEO, TrustPlutus told Moneycontrol.

“SBI Cards not only operates in a segment, which has very low penetrations but is also least prone to interventions from the government unless Agri credit cards are issued under pressure. Having said that, we believe that valuations may be slightly on the higher side for a PSU and thus allocation has to be careful,” he said.

Last week, the Indian stock markets remained under pressure, tracking a collapse in global equities amid growing concerns about novel coronavirus' impact on global economy.

Nifty50 registered its worst weekly fall in since 2009, while making it one of the worst monthly fall since September 2018.

While the S&P BSE Sensex plunged 5.96 percent, Nifty50 was down 6.21 percent in the month of February.

""In the forthcoming week, all eyes would be glued on the most awaited SBI Cards IPO and RITES OFS by the Government of India. No matter the outcome, markets would broadly be driven by the virus and global sentiment,"" Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote said.

While the Sensex lost 2,872.83 points (7 percent) to end at 38,297.29 in the past week, the Nifty shed 879.05 points (7.3 percent) to end at 11,201.8.

The BSE large-cap index shed 7.4 percent, BSE small-cap index and mid-cap index fell 7 percent last week.

Here are 10 key factors that will keep traders busy this week:

February auto sales numbers:

This week, auto companies are going to report their monthly sales numbers for the month of February 2020.

According to experts, the wholesale numbers are expected to be under pressure in CVs, 2Ws and PVs due to inventory correction by dealers before the BS6 transition.

However, marginal growth is likely to be seen in tractors due to the low base from last year and improved customer sentiment.

While M&M is expected to see 5 percent YoY growth, Escorts should register flat growth. The low base from last year and better customer sentiment are supporting demand, Emkay said.

In the domestic market the volume declines are expected for TVS Motor (-22 percent YoY), Hero MotoCorp (-16 percent) and Bajaj Auto (-14 percent).

According to Motilal Oswal, in February 2020, the wholesale volumes are estimated to decline 20 percent/11 percent/35 percent YoY for 2Ws/PVs/CVs due to stopping of BS4 production. Tractors are expected to grow by 5.5 percent YoY.

SBI Card IPO:

The initial public offering of SBI Cards and Payment Services, the credit card arm of State Bank of India (SBI), will open for subscription on March 2 and will close on March 5.

The company plans to issue new shares worth Rs 500 crore and an offer for sale of up to 13,05,26,798 equity shares.

As a part of the offer for sale, parent company SBI will sell up to 3,72,93,371 shares and CA Rover Holdings, an affiliate of the Carlyle Group, will sell up to 9,32,33,427 shares.

Coronavirus:

The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, now named CORVID-19, remained the major fears for the world economy after six other countries reporting their first cases.

Around 2,870 people had died in China as of March 1 due to the novel coronavirus. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China stood at 79,824.

Global sentiments remained weak as more cases of coronavirus are being reported outside of China, especially in South Korea.

Crude prices:

A meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies including Russia, a grouping known as OPEC+, is scheduled to be held in Vienna, Austria over March 5-6.

Oil prices slipped for the sixth consecutive day to its lowest in over a year on the fears that a slowing global economy would hit energy demand.

The Brent Crude price slipped by $20 in nearly two months to $50 per barrel, which is the lowest level since December 2018.

Technical outlook:

Last week, Nifty remained under pressure as bears had an upper hand over the bulls. The index made the 'lower high and lower low' formation on the daily chart.

The support of the rising trend line of wedge pattern is coming around 11,000, so there is still room for 200 points in Nifty on the downside, experts suggest.

""The overall trend for Nifty continues to remain negative until it reclaims 11600 mark on the higher side. The momentum indicator MACD has already provided sell crossover in the previous week which is hinting of further weakness in the Nifty,"" Nilesh Ramesh Jain, Derivative analyst- Equity Research at AnandRathi said.

""Although after falling for the seventh straight session, dead cat bounce cannot be ruled out and expect a tepid start on Monday with a negative bias,"" he added.

F&O cues:

Nifty continued to make lower highs - lower lows and formed a Big Bearish Candle on weekly scale as sustained selling pressure was seen for most part of the week.

The Nifty started the March series with a higher open interest (OI) base whereas rollovers were at 77 percent, which is much higher than its three months’ average rollover.

During the week, the Nifty turned into a discount of 40 points, which is clearly pointing towards aggressive short formation.

The 11,000 strike Put holds the highest OI for coming week whereas positions are also seen in 10,800 and 10,700 strikes indicating a move below 11,000 would open more downsides.

"March 01, 2020 08:34 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/sbi-card-ipo-subscription-to-begin-on-march-2-should-you-subscribe-4988181.html,"Much awaited SBI Cards and Payment Services IPO — the largest of 2020 — will open for subscription on March 2 with a price band of Rs 750-755 per share.

The subsidiary of India's largest lender, the State Bank of India (SBI), is aiming to raise Rs 10,355 crore through this initial public offering (IPO) — the biggest in size since October 2017. The IPO will close on March 5.

This consists of a fresh issue of Rs 500 crore and the rest is an offer for sale by parent company SBI and investor CA Rover Holdings, an affiliate of private equity corporation Carlyle Group.

The main objective of this IPO is unlocking of the value for existing investors, SBI and Carlyle Group.

Moneycontrol checked all brokerage recommendation reports on the IPO of the second largest credit card company and found that every research house, which rated, has advised subscribing to the issue.

But, why are brokerages looking so confident about the company when the market has been struggling to find the bottom amid fears of the coronavirus which has ruined global sentiment and sent all global markets bleeding. This included India, which lost over 7 percent last week and ultimately had Rs 11.6 lakh crore of investors' wealth wiped out.

The first major reason they see is the strong support it has from its parent, State Bank of India. SBI has largest customer base of 44.5 crore as of December 2019, and provides access to its extensive branch network (of nearly 22,000) across India. This also opens up a room to become a significant source of new customers in future.

The State Bank of India currently holds 74 percent stake in the company and the rest is held by CA Rover Holdings, which will be reduced to 69.51 percent and 22.40 percent, respectively, after the issue.

For 9MFY20, SBI Cards has sourced around 52 percent of new accounts through open market distribution channel (retail/co-brand partnerships), 48 percent from bank distribution channel i.e. SBI.

As on 9MFY20, SBI Cards has a large sales workforce consisting of 32,677 outsourced sales personnel and 3,190 open market points of sale across 145 cities covering most of India’s territory.

""Compared to industry which sources 70 percent from banca & 30 percent from open market, SBI Cards has much lower banca proportion. However, since past couple of years, SBI Cards has been working with SBI to increase the proportion of branch sourcing which has increased from 35.2 percent in FY17 to 51.6 percent for 9MFY20. There is still huge untapped potential to increase business from SBI branches which has a wide network,"" ABM Equity said.

""Out of around 22,000 SBI branches, SBIC has physical presence by its outsourced sales workforce in 15,686 branches as of 9MFY20. Banca channel has its advantage wherein the captive customer base of the bank is tapped for new credit cards account, thereby reducing the cost of acquisition and the risk of delinquency,"" it added.

The second largest credit card issuer in India (after HDFC Bank with 27 percent), with deep industry expertise and strong business model is another reason for brokerages to advise the issue.

SBI Cards is the second largest credit card issuer in the country in terms of number of credit cards outstanding and total credit card spends in the Indian credit card market. The company has 93.2 lakh outstanding credit cards and around Rs 98,486 crore in terms total credit card spends as on December 2019 entailing into a market share of 18.1 percent and 17.9 percent, respectively.

""We believe that SBI cards is a formidable play on rising discretionary spends and non cash economy given a) broad reach and parentage of SBI b) under-utilized captive banca potential c) leadership in co-branded cards and d) 40 percent contribution of premium cards,"" Prabhudas Lilladher said, while initiating coverage on SBI Cards and Payment Services, with a buy recommendation and target price of Rs 1,191 — a potential upside of nearly 54 percent over higher end of price band.

The above target price is slightly higher than the grey market premium, which according to experts is around around Rs 350-380 per share.

Over the years, SBI Cards has been constantly gaining market share, being the highest in terms of incremental cards with 45 percent market share in July 2019 and 24 percent during the three-months (May-July 2019).

The revenue from credit card products consists primarily of interest on credit card receivables and non-interest income primarily comprising of fee-based income such as interchange fees, late fees, annual credit card membership fees and other fees.

SBI Cards has a well-diversified revenue pool with NII constituting 40 percent, fees and commission earned (58 percent) and other income (2 percent). Interest is earned when cardholders roll over their dues while fees and commission includes interchange fees, late fees, annual fees, etc.

""Higher Fees & Commission proportion provides more stability to income currently while also leaving more potential for SBI Cards to tap and increase its loan book to earn higher interest & profitability. NIM earned has been largely stable at strong levels of around 15 percent while Net Credit margin i.e. adjusting for credit cost is around 11 percent which indicates risk-adjusted return is favorable,"" ABM Equity said.

The third reason brokerages have highlighted is the strong financials that the company has reported in the last several years with superior return ratios and faster business growth than industry.

Having diversified portfolio of credit card offerings and diversified revenue model, SBI Cards has total asset size of Rs 26,000 crore as of December 2019. Its return on equity (ROE) stood at 28.4 percent in FY19 and 36.5 percent in April-December FY20, while return on assets (ROA) stood at 4.8 percent in FY19 (increased from 4 percent in FY17) and 6.7 percent in 9MFY20.

Profitability of the company is growing by leaps and bounds, reported PAT has grown by 52 percent CAGR during FY17-19 and revenue from operations 44.6 percent CAGR.

""Going forward, trend is likely to continue - PAT is estimated to grow by 57 percent CAGR during FY20-22, with ROE/ROA over 33/7 percent in FY21, given favourable demographics, rise in digital payments, boom in e-commerce industry, SBI parentage and aggressive approach of the management,"" LKP Securities, which has advised subscribing to the issue has said. It sees fair value of Rs 1,220, discounting its FY22e ABV by 9.5x, giving upside potential of 57.4 percent from the IPO price.

The fourth reason being highlighted is the underpentration in Indian credit card industry compared to developed countries, with strong co-branded partnerships, technology upgradation and rising trends of digital payments as younger people prefer to use them for consumption needs.

During FY17 to FY19, SBI Cards' total credit card spends grew at a rate of 54.2 percent and the number of credit cards outstanding at a 34.5 percent CAGR as compared to a 35.6 percent and 25.6 percent CAGR for the overall credit card industry respectively, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

According to Crisil Research, credit card spends have registered robust growth, growing at a CAGR of 32 percent during FY15-FY19 to reach Rs 6 lakh crore in FY19. It is expected to grow at a healthy rate to reach Rs 15 lakh crore in FY24.

""We expect SBI Cards to continue to register healthy CAGR over FY2020-24 owing to (a) Significantly underpenetrated Indian credit card market; number of credit cards per 100 people is 3, whereas in developed/developing countries it is more than 30. (b) As on Q3FY2020, credit card to debit card ratio was 3.7 percent for SBI Cards (versus peers viz. HDFC Bank – 45 percent, Axis Bank – 28 percent and ICICI Bank – 18 percent), which clearly indicates huge scope for mining SBI Bank customers. (c) Total credit card outstanding loan as a percentage of banking sector loan is just 1.22 percent, and retail loan is 27 percent, indicating enough space to increase credit card loan book. (d) Credit card spend as percentage of GDP for India is 3 percent, while that for other countries is more than 10 percent. All the above factors clearly show that there is a huge room for credit card industry to grow,"" Angel Broking, which has recommended the issue said. It believes, with strong parentage and healthy capital adequacy, SBI Cards should be able to growth at healthy CAGR and gain market share.

While recommending investors to subscribe the issue for listing gains and also from long term perspective, ABM Equity also said, ""New Credit card accounts and number of credit card transactions have been growing at 25-30 percent range. Considering the low base, expect this trend to continue in medium to long term. With younger generation, expect credit risk culture to steadily increase over the years which shall enable the credit card business to grow at healthy pace. Focus on digitalization, developments in e-commerce and the demographic changes to keep structural growth in credit card intact.""

SBI Cards has 18 co-branded partnerships in its bucket, which again is the highest in the industry compared to other players, followed by ICICI Bank at 12 and RBL Bank at eight. Credit card spends from these co-branded credit cards increased to 24.7 percent from 19.3 percent of total credit card spends in 9MFY19 as compared to FY2019, respectively.

Highest number of co-brand tie-ups augurs well in customer acquisition as well enhance customer experience.

Accordingly, SBI Cards has witnessed robust growth in volume of transaction at 34 percent CAGR in FY14-19 to around 28 crore and 44 percent CAGR in overall spends to around Rs 1.03 lakh crore.

""Focus on increasing customer base with roll out of products in tier II and III cities, emphasize on corporate card business, tapping vast customer pool of parent (SBI) is to lead to higher customer base. Technology upgradation and improved partner tie-up and reward offers to induce and increase transaction volume, thereby supporting growth in business and profitability,"" ICICI Securities said.

Prabhudas Lilladher said continuous evolution of technological/data analytics capabilities will increase credit card numbers and transaction volumes which would drive operating leverage and reduce cost income ratio by 446bps over FY20-22.

SBI Cards is the first company from the Indian credit card industry with niche business to list on bourses. This is the fifth reason being given by brokerages.

""Generally, the company which has niche business and first listing in the particular industry always attracts a lot of interest from investors. Hence SBI Cards is the first one to list in the card industry business and on top of that, it is a consumer-oriented business company growing higher than industry. Given healthy financials, niche business and first time listing from cards industry, there is a lot of interest for SBI Cards,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Senior Vice President, Head-Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.

The sixth reason is the manageable asset quality of the company, though it is a risk given the weakening economic and employment trends.

""SBI Cards' asset quality is fairly manageable considering the unsecured nature of credit card business & superior NIM it is able to earn. As on 9MFY20, its gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio was 2.5 percent and net NPA ratio was 0.8 percent. The NPA ratios are slightly higher than industry which has GNPA ratio of around 2.0 percent. We believe there is a scope that NPA ratios could relatively improve going ahead as contribution from banca distribution increases. SBIC’s credit cost has been stable at around 3.5 percent which is under control,"" ABM Equity said.

The attractive valuations, though at premium levels, is the seventh reason for subscribing to the issue.

""At the upper price band, the company is trading at 7.9x FY21e and 5.6x FY22e ABV. Given key strengths of the company like - its unique business model which is a pure credit card play, high growth phase alongwith strong profitability matrix, favourable demographic dividend, it is likely to trade at higher multiples,"" LKP Research said.

Prabhudas Lilladher, which also noted that SBI Cards is being offered at significant premium to global peers which are trading at 9x-13x FY22 EPS, expects premium valuations to sustain given unique business model of standalone cards business, 35 percent EPS CAGR and attractive return ratios.

SBI Cards offers investment opportunity in unique business model with strong profitability, said ICICI Securities, adding sustainability of higher business growth and strong return ratios justifies premium valuation for the business.

State Bank of India will be holding a mega e-auction of over 1,000 open plots, commercial, residential and industrial properties on February 26, 2020.

It will be auctioning these non-performing assets (NPAs) this month to recover its dues from those borrowers, sources said.

These properties are located in New Delhi, Ghaziabad (Uttar Pradesh), Shahjahanpur (UP), Badanpur (UP), Lucknow (UP), Kottayam (Kerala), Kollam (Kerala), Palakkad (Kerala), Burdwan (West Bengal), Nadia (West Bengal), Karur (Tamil Nadu), Nilgris (Tamil Nadu), Erode (Tamil Nadu), Tiruppur (Tamil Nadu), Tindivanam (Tamil Nadu), Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu), Namakkal (Tamil Nadu), Jaipur (Rajasthan), Amreli (Gujarat), Ahmedabad (Gujarat), Anand (Gujarat), Jalgaon, Nandurbar, Nagpur (Maharashtra), Boripada (Orissa), Ramgarh (Jharkhand), Durg (Chattisgarh) among others.

The bidders can bid for the properties online after registering online by February 26, 2020 on the website of https://www.bankeauctions.com/SBI or https://ibapi.in or https://sbi.auctiontiger.net or www.tenderwizard.com/SBIEAUCTION.

Most of these properties are those that have been pledged as collateral for housing and other business loans and taken over by the bank under the Security and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (Sarfaesi) Act due to non-payment of pending dues by the borrowers. The defaulters were given a notice period of 60 days under the Sarfaesi Act, after which the properties were seized and auctioned.

""If a borrower fails to honour the loan, we start the legal process and repossess the property and later sell it at an e-auction. We have empanelled valuers who keep the construction, location and the area in mind before valuing the property. The plausible value given by them helps us set the reserve price which is disclosed to the bidder beforehand. Those interested in the bid have to deposit an initial amount of 10to 15 percent of the value of the property,"" said a bank official.

But do banks make a profit from e-auctions?

“In the current market conditions we try and recover the principal amount. We were able to make 15 to 25 percent profit earlier but now we are not even able to recover auction and valuation costs,” says an official not wanting to be named.

Buyers should not have the misconception that these properties always have legal issues attached to them. “Banks are in a position to auction properties only if they have a clear legal title. Also, prices of such properties are at least 5% to 10% less than the market value, so it’s worth signing up for the auction. Also, it is a direct deal between the buyer and the bank as there are no agents or brokers involved,” says a bank official.

As per the Act, those signing up for the e-auction have to pay 10% of the reserve price set for the distressed property which is returned in case the bidder is not successful. If the bidder is successful, the amount is adjusted in the final price.

Banks seize properties when they are convinced that the borrower will not be able to repay a loan. After the borrower misses multiple payments, the lender auctions the property to recover the outstanding principal and interest amount. Given the troubled past of such properties, they are usually available at a discount to the market price.

Banks give out details of the properties they are auctioning. A portal launched by the Indian Banks Association (IBA) provides a common platform. Prospective buyers can log on to ibapi.in, register themselves, view details of properties and even participate in the auction process.

In case of residential properties that are auctioned, buyers should check if there are any ""liabilities associated with the property that is being auctioned"".

""These could include society dues and other liabilities unknown to the lenders. There is always a deficit in information and the discount on offer is due to that. On an average such properties sell at a discount of 15 percent,"" said a valuer.

Banks get the premises vacated before they are auctioned and have to get possession of the house through a collector or a district magistrate to avoid any law and order issues.

Since those bidding for the property in an e-auction are allowed to inspect the property, they should check from the society if there are any dues pending against the property in question. There could be cases of subletting that may not be known to the bank. If that is the case, the buyer who purchases such a property will not be in a position to sell without the tenant’s approval. Sub-tenancy can create its own share of problems. No buyer will know that until he actually goes and resides in that property, he adds.

Also, if a buyer plans to take a loan for purchasing the property, he should try and get an in-principle home loan approval from the lender. Banks give such loan approvals solely on the basis of the credit history and repayment capacity of the bidder. The loan is sanctioned by the bank on the condition that the bidder will cover the applicable property registration charges, stamp duty and other legal costs and submit the valid property registration document with the bank, before the disbursal of the actual loan."

With the telecom firms staring at a massive Rs 1.47 lakh crore of AGR dues, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar on Monday said ""nobody wants to kill the sector"". The state-owned bank is yet to hear from the government on the issue, he said, when asked if it has sought views from bankers.

""Nobody wants to kill the sector, let me be very clear,"" Kumar said, when asked about the problems being faced by the telecom industry.

It can be noted that earlier this month, Kumar had said that State Bank of India has a loan outstanding of Rs 29,000 crore to the telecom sector and another Rs 14,000 crore in bank guarantees, which can get invoked in case of a non-payment of dues by the telcos.

There has been a flurry of meetings in the national capital between senior official of the telecom firms and the government over the past week.

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court has asked the telecom firms to deposit an estimated Rs 1.47 lakh crore in past dues for spectrum and licences by March 17.

Payment of the dues is being seen as an existential threat for some players, especially Vodafone Idea, which has to pay RS 53,000 crore."

On the eve of US President Donald Trump's visit to India, State Bank of India Managing Director Dinesh Khara has said such bilateral visits create tremendous goodwill and offer opportunities to New Delhi and Washington to “spot opportunities” for each other, irrespective of whether any deals are signed or not.

Trump arrives in India Monday for the state visit and will be accompanied by a high-level delegation including First Lady Melania Trump, the President's daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.

“Such kind of visits creates a whole lot of goodwill and such kind of goodwill is a very important aspect when it comes to developing trade. Treaty or no treaty, but the confidence level itself generates enough amount of trade,” Khara told PTI in an exclusive interview here.

He said that such high-level bilateral visits “help both sides to understand each other better, such visits also offer an opportunity to spot opportunities for each other. So maybe irrespective of the trade deal, this will be a positive for both the countries.”

India and the US were looking to sign a trade deal during Trump's visit but the US President said that he is ""saving the big deal"" with India for later and does not know if it will be signed before the presidential election in November.

On India and the US not signing a trade deal during the Trump visit, Khara said that such kind of decisions involve a “whole lot of patience and quite comprehensive analysis. Such (trade) decisions might take time but the outcomes normally seen after such a long deliberation are generally good. So maybe it's a matter of time, but eventually it might turn out to be good for the economies.”

Khara added that the perspective gets built in all these high-level bilateral visits goes a long way in terms of resolving issues. “Unless there is a perspective, the vexed issues don't get resolved.”

Talking to reporters at the Joint Base Andrews outside Washington last week, Trump had said “We can have a trade deal with India, but I''m really saving the big deal for later on.”

""We''re doing a very big trade deal with India. We''ll have it. I don''t know if it''ll be done before the election, but we''ll have a very big deal with India,"" he said. During his interaction with journalists, Trump once again voiced his concern over US-India trade relations. ""We''re not treated very well by India,"" the US president said.

India is demanding exemption from high duties imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products, resumption of export benefits to certain domestic products under their Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), greater market access for its products from sectors including agriculture, automobile, auto components and engineering.

On the other hand, the US wants greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, dairy items and medical devices, and cut on import duties on some ICT products. The US has also raised concerns over high trade deficit with India which was USD 16.9 billion in 2018-19.

Trump praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he is looking forward to his visit to India. ""I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot,"" Trump said."

""The method of bills or receivables of exporters have to be changed. Our experience has been extremely bad when the associates/subsidiaries are involved, wherein bills are raised and business are directed through associates/subsidiaries,"" Kumar told a banking conclave organised by the apex exporters body FIEO.

He also said the collateral gives some comfort to bankers while giving finance to exporters, but in terms of recoveries they are not very helpful.

""There are disputes and long time is taken to realise the collateral. I don't think it gives you any kind of comfort, which can only come from timely repayment,"" he said.

As a wayout, Kumar suggested that enhancing the insurance coverage from the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (ECGC) to 90% can help banks reduce collateral for exporters.

He said bankers have agreed that they will reduce the cost of lending for exporters if the ECGC will increase the cover to 90%.

""If export finance has to be collateral-free then the ECGC coverage has to be enhanced which will help in both reducing the cost and requirement of collateral,” he said.

Kumar also called for extending the interest subvention to all MSME units, irrespective of their target market—serving the domestic market or exports, but added that the discounted rates should be used only at the receivable discounting level.

Urging exporters to develop trust with bankers and the system in general he said, ""I always have maintained that one Nirav Modi did not cause a loss of Rs 14,000 crore to one bank, as the damage he did to the system is much higher say Rs 1 lakh crore."""

Banks that have exposure to the troubled telecom industry in the country, may get affected if any of the top players file for bankruptcy as they failed to get relief from the Supreme Court of India (SC) in the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) matter.

Other than the State Bank of India (SBI), lenders like ICICI Bank, Punjab National Bank (PNB), Yes Bank and IDBI Bank also have exposure to Vodafone Idea.

So far, banks have said that loans to the affected telecom companies were standard and did not need extra provisioning.

Banks will have to pay price if any telecom company files for bankruptcy: SBI Chairman

SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar, on February 15, said that banks will ""have to pay the price"" in case any telecom firm files for bankruptcy. This came a day after the Supreme Court made it clear that telecom companies will have to pay the Rs 1.47 lakh crore in past dues.

He said that the bank is in ""wait-and-watch mode"" and the onus of ensuring telecom companies' compliance with the Supreme Court order lies with the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) under the government.

RBI MPC likely to extend pause as January CPI data stokes concerns

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to keep rates unchanged in the April policy review as the country's retail inflation rose above the Monetary Policy Committee's target for the second month in a row.

Deposit rates likely to ease on RBI measures, but concerns on credit pick-up remain

Interest rates on deposits are likely to ease further going ahead after the RBI skipped policy rate cut and introduced liquidity boosting measures to support growth. While transmission of the lower cost of funds is expected to bring down lending rates, it may not be enough to revive credit demand.

"February 10, 2020 08:47 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/sbis-virtual-debit-card-should-you-opt-for-it-4924911.html,"State Bank of India (SBI) recently introduced a ‘Virtual Card’ for its net-banking users. This card is meant only for your internet shopping. It allows users to pay on e-commerce (Flipkart, Amazon, etc.) and merchant websites without revealing the card details. In simple words, this is not a physical card; it is identified by its number.

The virtual card is in-line with the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) new set of guidelines – announced in its December 2019 monetary policy – to improve security for card holders of a bank and to issue new prepaid payment instruments (PPIs).

What’s on offer?

The virtual card from SBI acts as a debit card with a limit. A user can apply for this virtual card only using the bank’s internet banking facility. The minimum transaction amount to create a virtual card is Rs 100 and you can spend a maximum amount of Rs 50,000. The card is valid for a period of 48 hours or till the transaction is completed. This is a single-use card, i.e., once it’s used for a transaction, it cannot be used again. So, in case you have used only a part of the amount of a virtual card for a transaction, the unutilised amount will be available in your bank account. There is no issuance fee and no limit on the number of virtual cards a user can apply for in a day. The virtual card can be used for online payment in Indian Rupees (INR), in India, Nepal and Bhutan only.

The virtual card creation and online transaction are authorised after successful validation of a one-time password (OTP) sent to the registered mobile number of the account holder. After successful validation, the card’s image with name, card number, expiry date, etc. will be displayed on the screen.

What works?

Since this is a virtual card, there is no danger of losing it, as the card is made available on your mobile phone. There is also no danger from phishing, as fraudsters cannot get access to your card details at, say, an ATM machine. Further, you can set the limit on the card. So, this limits your risks. The virtual card will be generated by marking a lien on the underlying account, so there will be no loss of interest for the account holder. In other words, the amount will be debited only when actual transaction using the virtual card is completed, successfully. In case virtual card is cancelled by the user or expires, the lien marked shall be lifted.

What doesn’t work?

Experts feel that the virtual card should be available for physical touch-point transactions as well. Sapna Tiwari, Co-founder and COO, Rupeewiz Investment Advisors says, “The use of the virtual card should be extended to point-of-sale (PoS) machines in retail shops, restaurants, etc. to pay regular utility bills online and for cash withdrawals at ATMs.”

Also, for multiple online transactions, a user needs to create several virtual cards online. A virtual card that allows for multiple transactions may work better for customers.

Only internet banking customers can apply for virtual cards. The bank should consider extending usage to foreign transactions on international e-commerce and merchant websites.

Moneycontrol’s take

A user who regularly transacts online should opt for this virtual card facility to secure his/her primary card details from fraudsters. As the card usage is protected through an OTP, which is only sent to the customer’s registered mobile number, the chances of fraudulent transactions are low. However, the user must take adequate precaution to ensure that the card details and OTP are not disclosed to any person who may misuse it."

The listing of SBI Cards is being held up over an investigation into the parent company's mutual funds arm, according to a Business Standard report.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is investigating SBI Mutual Fund over allegations of trading shares of Manappuram Finance using price-sensitive information.

Both SBI Cards and SBI Mutual Fund are subsidiaries of State Bank of India (SBI).

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

SBI Cards, SBI MF and SEBI have not yet responded to requests for comment by Business Standard.

“One of our group companies, SBI Funds Management, is involved in proceedings initiated against it by SEBI…” SBI Cards’ draft offer document stated, as seen by the publication.

SEBI has issued show cause notices, to which SBI Funds has responded, but the market regulator has not yet passed an order, the draft offer said.

SEBI, on February 5 modified the norms for initial public offerings (IPOs), which makes it unclear if there will be a delay on SBI Cards’ debut on stock exchanges.

According to the older norms framed in 2006, observations in draft order documents have to be kept in abeyance for 90 days from the date of the show cause notice, or from the filing of the draft offer, whichever is later.

The newer guidelines do away with the abeyance period in cases where the show cause notice was given to the entity in a adjudication proceeding.

SBI and Carlyle Group, which together own 76 percent of SBI Cards, will be divesting some of their stake in the company."

The country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on Friday announced a 5 basis points reduction in its MCLR across tenors, effective February 10. This is the ninth consecutive cut in MCLR by the bank in the current fiscal.

With this reduction, the one-year marginal cost of fund-based rate (MCLR) has come down to 7.85 percent per annum from 7.90 percent, a bank statement said.

The reduction in MCLR by the bank comes a day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) left the repo rates unchanged at 5.15 percent but announced long-term repo operation for up to Rs 1 lakh crore, making cost of funds cheaper for banks.

SBI further said in view of surplus liquidity in the system, it has realigned its interest rate on retail term deposits (less than Rs 2 crore) and bulk term deposits (Rs 2 crore and above), effective February 10.

It slashed term deposits rates by 10-50 bps in the retail segment and 25-50 bps in the bulk segment.

""The impact of recent RBI policy measures and reduction in deposit rates will be reflected in the next review of MCLR,"" the bank said."

The country's major lender State Bank of India on January 31 reported its historically highest ever quarterly profit of Rs 5,583.4 crore (up 41 percent YoY) in Q3FY20, backed by better margins, lower provisions and major recovery from one of its bad accounts (Essar Steel).

Brokerages maintained their bullish stance on the stock and majority of them expect the stock to return more than 30 percent in next one year period, following strong outlook from the management.

""Key positive was fresh slippages (excluding the housing finance company account) were quite lower, while SMA book came off & progressive resolutions on stress seems to leading to some optimistic visibility on asset quality,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher which retained buy call on the stock with revised target of Rs 419 (from Rs 413) based on 1.3x core Sep-21 ABV and Rs 118 for subsidiaries.

The brokerage feels going ahead, loan growth improvement, NIMs & credit cost trends will drive return ratios with much better position on both strong PCR & Tier-I capital. ""We have slightly tweaked loan growth lower, adjusted NIMs and factored in stake sale gains from SBI Cards (adjusted in SOTP as well).""

State Bank of India expects better profitability in Q4 as well, led by better asset-quality trend, one-off gains from SBI Cards and lower tax.

Motilal Oswal also maintained its buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 425 as it believes that SBI has prudently improved provision coverage ratio (PCR) over the last few years, and has one of the lowest stressed assets amongst corporate banks, which will drive a sharp decline in credit cost to 1.3/1.1 percent by FY21/22.

""Also, further NCLT write-backs/subsidiaries monetization will boost earnings. We fine tune earnings and estimate PAT of Rs 31,900/41,800 crore in FY21/22,"" the brokerage said.

SBI reported a strong operating performance in a tough quarter, led by NCLT recoveries, improving fee income trends and controlled operating expenses.

Net interest income during the quarter grew by 22.42 percent year-on-year to Rs 27,778.8 crore, with loan growth of 7.4 percent YoY. Domestic net interest margin (NIM) improved to 3.59 percent in Q3FY20, registering an increase of 62 bps YoY and 37 bps sequentially.

As expected, asset quality improved as the Q3 saw a convergence of lumpy corporate NPAs (gross slippages at Rs 20,100 crore including DHFL - Rs 7,000 crore) and resolution (Essar Steel) leading to reduction in gross NPA ratio to 6.94 percent for the seventh quarter in a row. However, GNPA ratio for Card company increased QoQ to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent in Q2.

Net NPA declined 14bps QoQ to 2.65 percent in the quarter ended December 2019.

Corporate SMA 1/2 book now stands lower at Rs 8,100 crore versus Rs 18,300 crore in Q2. The bank expects OTS in 2 power accounts of Rs 3,200 crore (Jindal India Thermal/Coastal energy) and restructuring of 4 accounts of Rs 7,090 crore with a PCR of 78 percent.

Slippages came in at elevated levels (led by stressed HFC account) but were under control in the overall corporate portfolio. Also, management guided for moderation in NPL formation, while recovery is likely to remain strong.

""We believe that an improving asset-quality outlook and better operating metrics in the PSU bank space are positives,"" said Sharekhan which maintained buy rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 415.

Emkay also maintained buy/overweight stance in Emkay Alpha Portfolio with a revised targetof Rs 380 (earlier Rs 350), given its strong liability profile, higher retail orientation, reasonable capital position and better return ratios among PSBs. ""Accelerating power NPA resolutions and Cards IPO will be near-term positives for the stock.""

Recovery and upgrades during the quarter were Rs 13,553 crore (including big amount from Essar Steel), against Rs 3,931 crore in previous quarter, the bank said in its BSE filing.

Provisions for bad loans fell sharply by 25.8 percent sequentially (down 41.4 percent YoY) to Rs 8,193.06 crore.

State Bank of India said that it expects to arrest slippages going ahead as the stress in its corporate loan book has been taken care of. However, the country's largest lender pared its credit growth target amid concerns on current economic conditions.

""The corporate book seems to be very normal. No large ticket loan under stress and within retail, housing loans, car loans and personal loans, are all doing very well. There is no issue,"" said Rajnish Kumar, Chairman, SBI. He added that there has been no major change in SME loans, while agriculture loans slippage is about Rs 3,000 crore average every quarter.

SBI expects slippages of Rs 5,000-6,000 crore in the January-March quarter.

The bank posted a record high quarterly profit of Rs 5,583 crore in the October-December period, on account of recovery of around Rs 11,000 crore in the Essar Steel account.

In the January-March quarter, the bank expects recoveries of about Rs 7000 crore from three accounts that includes a steel and a textile company."

Services of public sector banks were impacted as employee unions went on a two-day nationwide strike from Friday to press for wage revision. However, private sector lenders like ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank were operational.

Many banks, including State Bank of India (SBI), had informed customers in advance that operations may be impacted to some extent due to the strike.

Cash deposit, withdrawal, cheque clearances, instrument issuance and loan disbursement were affected.

With this strike, banks would be closed for three days including Sunday. Banks will open only on Monday, February 3.

The strike coincides with the beginning of the Budget session of parliament and presentation of Union Budget 2020-21.

The strike call has been given by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of nine bank unions, including All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC), All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) and National Organisation of Bank Workers (NOBW).

Unions claimed that about 10 lakh staff and officers of public sector banks and some private sector banks are participating in strike.

Branches of public sector banks were closed in many parts of country, as per initial reports.

Wage revision for employees of public sector banks is pending since November 2017.

In the past wage settlement, which was for the period November 1, 2012, to October 31, 2017, employees got a hike of 15 per cent.

During discussions, the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) on Thursday improved their offer to 13.5 per cent, but this was not acceptable, the unions said.

However, IBA in a statement said despite the revised offer of up to 19 per cent hike, including performance linked incentive, made by it during the meeting on Thursday, the unions decided to go ahead with the all-India bank strike.

A section of bank employees had gone on a day-long strike on January 8 in support of 10 major trade unions' protest call against the government's ""anti-people"" policies."

As a result, banking services of state-run lenders will likely be impacted at branches and ATMs across the country. Services such as cheque clearances, cash deposit, cash withdrawal and loan disbursements at bank branches could be affected during the strike.

However, customers will be able to carry out routine transactions through digital channels such as net banking and mobile banking. A number of public sector banks like the State Bank of India (SBI) have issued alerts to their customers.

The bank employees’ unions have been demanding a 20 percent pay hike, five-day workweek, family pension, scrapping of new pension scheme and staff welfare fund among other things.

The Indian Banking Association (IBA), the representative body of banks’ management, has been negotiating with the unions, but to no avail. In a meeting held on January 30, the IBA sweetened its offer of 13 percent to 15 percent for a wage increase that was not accepted by the unions.

According to IBA, the offer was revised to up to 19 percent including a performance-linked incentive. However, the management body said that other demands like five-day workweek were not acceptable. The country is among those with the highest number of public holidays in the world and adding 26 more holidays would add problems for customers.

“For the inconvenience of the customers, banks will keep alternative channels available and customers can utilise these alternate/digital channels of banking 24x7 for day-to-day banking,” the IBA said in a note.

If the demands were not met, the unions will go for a three-day strike from March 11 to 13 and an indefinite strike from April 1."

Bank unions have decided to go on a two-day nationwide strike from Friday as talks with management of public sector lenders on wage revision have failed to reach a consensus. Many banks, including SBI, have informed customers that operations may be impacted to some extent due to the strike.

The strike will coincide with the beginning of the Budget session of parliament and presentation of union Budget 2020-21.

The strike call has been given by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of nine bank unions, including All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC), All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) and National Organisation of Bank Workers (NOBW).

Earlier this week, a meeting with the Chief Labour Commissioner remained inconclusive, AIBOC President Sunil Kumar said.

The wage revision for employees of public sector banks is pending since November 2017.

""Today's talks with Indian Banks' Association (IBA) failed on demand from unions, so strike call stands,"" AIBEA General Secretary C H Venkatachalam said.

IBA's rigid approach has left unions with no option than to go on strike, Vekatachalam said, adding, ""We appeal to the banking customers to bear with us for this disruption in services due to the strike but the same has been forced on us by the bank managements and IBA.""

In a circular, UFBU accused the IBA of a rigid approach towards demands for a fair wage revision settlement.

A meeting of UFBU held at Mumbai on January 13 came to the unanimous conclusion that intensified agitational actions have to be taken to press our demands, NOBW Vice President Ashwini Rana said.

During the recent period, prices have gone up steeply and the workload on the banking workforce has also gone up enormously, UFBU said, adding that bank staffers expect a fair and reasonable hike in wages in the current settlement.

Unions are demanding 20 per cent hike on pay slip components with adequate loading.

In the past wage settlement, which was for the period November 1, 2012, to October 31, 2017, the employees got a hike of 15 per cent.

It will contribute around Rs 4,500 crore of the total funding required for the airport project, which stands at Rs 16,000-crore.

The construction of the Navi Mumbai Airport project will be undertaken by a consortium led by GVK Power and Infra, which is also the group that currently runs the Mumbai airport.

The report mentioned that while the development is positive on the financing front, the delay in funding for the project is expected to push its completion behind by at least two years. While construction was expected to begin in October, L&T, the company that was given the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) for the project, has not got the letter of approval to begin work.

Construction of the Navi Mumbai Airport project first got approval from the state government in 2008, and it is to be established on 1,160 hectares of land in phases."

With difficulties in NBFC sector continuing, economists at SBI on January 17 pitched for the Reserve Bank to play its role as the lender of last resort, something the central bank has avoided since the start of troubles in 2018. In its report on Budget expectations, the economists said RBI should ""seriously think"" of providing liquidity to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) against the assets held by the lenders.

""Given the crisis of confidence in the financial markets, it is imperative that central banks don't forget their primary function of being the lender of the last resort,"" they said.

The NBFC sector has been impacted since August 2018 after the collapse of infrastructure lender IL&FS.

So far, RBI has refused to play its role as the lender of last resort, terming the problem at select NBFCs as one created because of asset-liability mismatches, where entities depended on short-term liabilities to fund long-term assets and found the going difficult with hike in rates.

A slew of analysts have blamed the slowdown in lending by the liquidity-starved NBFCs for the fall in consumption, which is among the factors resulting in dip in GDP growth.

The SBI report included help for NBFCs as part of its fiscal policy suggestions ahead of the February 1 Budget.

It suggested a formal arrangement can be worked out wherein the Government of India can commit to adjust the haircuts that come banks' way by settling it with RBI's dividend transfers.

The economists said the measures taken so far by the government and RBI have been focused on long-term strengthening of NBFC sector.

They also pitched for deferment of principal repayments by 50 systemically important NBFCs and housing finance companies for a specified period.

Among other measures, SBI economists recommended the government to focus on growth and not on meeting the fiscal deficit target, warning that not doing so can aggravate issues of growth slowdown.

They advocated for fiscal deficit to be budgeted at an elevated 3.8 per cent for 2020-21 financial year, which is the same level as its revised estimate of 3.8 per cent which will be met in 2019-20.

The government should adopt a new fiscal consolidation path from FY22 onwards which will look at 0.20 per cent narrowing of the fiscal gap every year till FY25, they said.

To push up the agricultural sector and health outcomes for school children, the government can announce a scheme called ""Poushtik Bharat"", they said.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court's refusal to grant relief for telecom service providers can have ""significant financial market disruptions if any of the telecom players makes a decision to discontinue"".

Such a move can prove to be a drag on consumption growth, which was supposed to revive in 2020-21, they said."

To regain the trust of homebuyers, State Bank of India (SBI) has announced the Residential Builder Finance with Buyer Guarantee (RBBG) to safeguard homebuyers financially by issuing guarantee for completion of projects to customers availing SBI Home Loans.

Buyers will now be able to secure their investment in the ongoing home projects financed by the bank itself. The term of the guarantee will coincide with the time it takes to receive an occupation certificate for the project.

The scheme is only available to buyers who have taken a home loan from SBI for the projects identified and eligible for the bank guarantee, SBI officials told Moneycontrol.

Under the scheme, the bank has committed to refund the principal loan amount if the developer fails to complete the project. What this means is that if a buyer has booked an apartment for Rs 2 crore and has paid Rs 1 crore, he will get back only Rs 1 crore in the event the project gets stuck. No interest will be refunded.

What is the scheme all about?

RBBG will focus on affordable housing segment in the range of up to Rs 2.50 crores in seven Indian cities initially. These include Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), National Capital Region (NCR), Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Pune, Kolkata and Chennai.

This will ensure that a large number of projects across all budget segments will get covered under it.

Borrowers can seek a refund if the builder fails to meet the deadline under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act. All builders have to get their projects registered under RERA and declare a timeline for its completion.

The guarantee will be available for RERA registered projects and a project will be considered stuck after it crosses the RERA deadline.

Under this product, all reputed builders fulfilling the prescribed criteria by the bank can avail loan between Rs. 50 crore to Rs. 400 crore.

Criteria includes star rating and CIBIL score.

Under RBBG, the guarantee would be given by the bank till the project gets the occupation certificate (OC).

The product also offers loans of up to Rs 400 crore to ‘reputed’ residential developers.

The guarantee will be part of an agreement between India’s largest lender, the developer and the homebuyer. The bank will fund the project and also extend the home loan necessary to buy a house.

""It could be a tripartite agreement or whatever is legally required,"" the bank officials said.

To begin with, SBI has tied up with city-based real estate developer Sunteck Realty for its three ongoing projects in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). These include Sunteck World project at Naigaon, 4th Avenue SunteckCity at Oshiwara District Centre (ODC), Goregaon (West) and upcoming project near Lokhandwala at Andheri (West).

""We feel that the partnership of the biggest bank of India and Sunteck Realty as a first brand for the scheme itself stands as an endorsement of our strong brand and product offerings, our track record of timely delivery and financial prudence. This unique initiative will provide multiple benefits to the homebuyers along with faster loan processing, competitive home loan rates along with quality product assurance.

""The guarantee will be part of a tripartite agreement between SBI, Sunteck Realty and the homebuyer. The homebuyers can secure their investment in the ongoing projects financed by the bank itself and can get a refund of the principal amount as per the bank's policy depending on the arrangement mentioned in the tripartite agreement,"" Kamal Khetan, Chairman and managing director, Sunteck Realty Ltd, told Moneycontrol.

What does the scheme hope to accomplish?

SRBBG seeks to safeguard homebuyers financially by issuing guarantee for completion of projects to customers availing SBI home loans.

""The housing project will be controlled by the bank - it will release funds to the developer and to the buyer. In this way there will be little chance of the project getting stalled or the bank guarantee getting invoked,"" the official said.

The scheme comes in at a time when the real estate sector is undergoing liquidity issues and under-construction projects have been impacted by the National Housing Bank’s decision to ban housing finance companies from offering interest subvention schemes.

It gives fence sitters a good enough reason to invest in under construction projects, which are usually considered as risky. Currently, with several projects stuck due to last mile funding issues, homebuyers are preferring to go in for ready-to-move-in units that are considered 'relatively safe'.

Real estate experts believe that such a scheme may increase sales volumes. By offering a guarantee on the money they have spent on the house, SBI is ensuring that the homebuyer has no reason to pursue insolvency proceedings in case of project delay or failure. The bank will also ensure that all of the builder’s payments to service providers are done through a SBI account, which will help the bank keep a close tab on any defaults.

Experts have termed it as a 'good move' and a positive for the real estate sector

The underlying provision of this scheme – that the bank commits to refund the principal loan amount if a developer fails to complete the project - will ensure that SBI remains highly selective in its approach and work only with the most reliable and trustworthy developers, said Anuj Puri, Chairman – ANAROCK Property Consultants.

To mitigate the risk of having to issue refunds, it will also keep a regular check on the progress of the project and see to it that it is completed on time. This will eventually give major assurance to all homebuyers who will opt for loans under this scheme from the SBI, and help in boosting their confidence, he said.

The scheme is aimed at safeguarding select SBI home loan clients who may get stuck in a project which has not been able to get completed for any reason/is not able to get the OC.

""There are some caveats - this would apply to only select projects where SBI does a thorough assessment of the builder and project viability - something which means that only few projects will pass muster. It is also not clear whether the pricing for such loans will be higher given the guarantee offered. This would also, of course hold true for the future and not cover existing loans. We hope that more lenders will follow suit and this would be welcome news to new homebuyers who may have been dithering on looking at under construction projects,"" said Gagan Randev, National Director, Capital Markets at Colliers International India.

Pankaj Bajaj, Managing Director, Eldeco Group, is of the view that the last couple of years have seen a strong preference towards ready-to-move-in properties as compared to under construction projects. The result was that developers of under construction projects started facing a funds crunch which led to a spiral of delayed projects, financial distress and further preference for under construction properties. In desperation developers were going for expensive funding of up to 20 percent per annum in order to complete the project.

Now this product from SBI brings back the confidence in and under construction project. Hopefully other mortgage lenders will follow, he added.

Will interest rate be higher than a conventional home loan rate?

No. There will be no additional cost to the home loan buyer. The builder may have to pay a nominal rate for the bank guarantee, the bank officials said.

In this case SBI is advancing loans to both builders and homebuyers. They will have a lien on the property, the land and various other collateral. Guarantee emanates from their conviction that they can make the builder complete the project as per the RERA timeline.

""They have complete control – almost like a quasi-project manager. This is good for the real estate ecosystem and will help boost sales,"" said Suresh Sadgopan, founder of Ladder7 Financial Advisories, a financial planning firm.

How will it help builders and homebuyers?

For the builder, it will by all means add more credibility to the concerned project which in turn will help him attract more homebuyers.

For homebuyers, given the condition of the scheme, they will be assured that buying in such projects (associated with SBI) will be least risky because the bank itself would be very wary of associating with unscrupulous players.

Are there any hurdles foreseen going forward?

At the onset of this scheme, it seems fairly attractive and affirmative for both builder and the homebuyers.

The only challenge will be do a constant follow-up on the project progress. The bank will have the additional task of ensuring that the project construction progresses on time for which it will have to set up an extra team of professionals, said Puri.

Jaxay Shah, Chairman, Credai, said that while it is good move, ""we have to see SBI how fast, efficient and aggressive they become in funding builder projects and it will remain to be seen how effectively the bank enters into new partnerships with developers because as we understand they will only give a guarantee scheme in projects they have funded"".

Homebuyers, however, are skeptical.

""Homebuyers, in any case, get a written guarantee by way of agreement from the builder. The builder buyer agreement has historically mentioned the rate at which penalty will be given to the homebuyer in case of default and also the refund clause. And yet, buyers have been forced to approach Supreme Court, NCLT, RERA or for that matter the consumer court.

""RERA authorities have been reluctant to order for refund on the ground that it may jeopardise the project and consequently interest of other homebuyers. In several instances where homebuyers managed to get refund orders the same has not been honoured. This scheme only reads good only on paper,"" said Abhay Upadhyay, president, member Forum for Peoples’ Collective Efforts (FPCE).

However, the scheme can be made full proof provided it is ensured that the principal amount is transferred to the buyer’s account on the same date there is a default or the date on which the project timeline lapses as is the case with most insurance policies without approaching any court of law or taking legal steps, he added.

What is the recourse available to buyers in case the project is delayed?

SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar has been quoted as saying that through this scheme SBI wants to take back the ""bankruptcy remote from homebuyers and operational creditors "".

What this means is that by offering a guarantee on the money spent on the house, SBI is ensuring that the homebuyer has no reason to pursue insolvency proceedings in case of project delay or failure.

Legal experts are of the view that the scheme does not prohibit a homebuyer from approaching any of the legal platforms available if the need were to arise - RERA and consumer court - in case the project is not completed or the loan amount is not refunded or for that matter even the NCLT in the event that the developer becomes insolvent. They said a guarantee is legally enforceable and primarily comes under contract law.

The definition of promoter under RERA too is very wide and includes a person who constructs or causes to be constructed an independent building or a building consisting of apartments, or converts an existing building or a part thereof into apartments, for the purpose of selling all or some of the apartments. A bank as a guarantor is involved in the development of the project may even be deemed to fall within this definition.

""Based on a preliminary read, this scheme appears to be two fold – one where the developer can avail a loan for the project after the requisite due diligence has been completed by the bank and also where the homebuyer can avail a home loan from the bank which is backed by a guarantee. Based on the announcement, in the event of default in project completion, the homebuyer is protected by way of a guarantee which ensures refund of money until the project obtains an occupancy certificate,"" said Yudhist Narain Singh, senior partner, YNS Associates.

""All other aspects of compliance including detailed project registration under RERA shall need to be mandatorily followed by the developers. Therefore, this scheme does not preclude the homebuyer from approaching RERA or the consumer forum for relief in the event that the project is not completed or his loan amount is not refunded. Typically, a guarantee shall only add to the claim of the buyer before any of these forums, since the bank stands as a guarantor for repayment,” he said.

Another thing that needs to be borne in mind is that the banks have to be careful while implementing such a scheme, especially in terms of the wording incorporated in the documentation that will be executed by the customer and the constant monitoring of project development.

""When the project and the buyer are both financed by the same entity, a lot can go wrong. We have seen examples of this in the past. As per the press release, initially this scheme focuses on affordable housing projects, which is good as it will help streamline it before applying it to other real estate projects. If the penultimate objective is to truly secure the homebuyer and restore confidence in the housing market, then this scheme may prove to be fruitful in the long run,"" he added."

State Bank of India (SBI), the country's largest lender, recently cut its lending rates linked to the central bank's repo rate by 25 basis points (bps), lowering borrowing costs for homebuyers.

Most experts are of the opinion that SBI's decision to cut home loan rates could encourage other banks to follow suit. It would also ensure that a large number of buyers who had applied for home loans earlier but were rejected on eligibility grounds, may now just make the cut due to the reduced rate.

Others say that an interest rate cut may be just one reason for buyers to go in for a property purchase but not the main reason. There are a range of factors that prospective buyers may want to consider before taking the plunge, such as job security, builder reputation, discounts offered by builders, GST rates not to mention the preference for ready-to-move-in apartment over an under construction one.

The recent rate cut by SBI makes home loans even more attractive to existing customers as well as new buyers. A 25 basis points decrease on a loan can mean substantial savings. For instance, a loan of Rs 40 lakh for 20 years at a rate of 8.45% accrues an interest payable of Rs 43 lakh. A 25 basis points reduction brings down the interest payable to Rs 41.5 lakh. This means savings of Rs 1.5 lakh. For new customers, this brings down the monthly EMI from approximately Rs 34,600 to Rs 34,000, a reduction of almost Rs 600 per month.

""We are seeing number of factors coming together, which makes investing in property a good idea. Apart from the low interest rates, other measures such as the RERA legislation, Credit Linked Subsidy Schemes such as PMAY, the increase in supply in the affordable housing segment, all put together make investing in property more reliable and rewarding. With a good number of unsold properties available, builders themselves are trying out several ways of attracting customers. So, it is a good time to invest in property,"" said Adhil Shetty, CEO, Bankbazaar.

Ashish R Puravankara, MD, Puravankara Limited, said SBI's move was the need of the hour.

""The decline in interest rates, from SBI is a welcome move. The rate cut is not only a relief to homebuyers, but it proved to be beneficial for the entire sector. It will also infuse a positive sentiment in the residential segment and act as a confidence booster for many potential homebuyers. Such initiatives will revitalize the entire realty ecosystem… we also hope that this move will start a trend which will be followed by other lending institutions, further widening the web of benefits for the homebuyers across the country, eventually pushing the overall demand for homes,” said Ashish R Puravankara, MD, Puravankara Limited.

SBI's decision to reduce the home loan interest rate is expected to have a direct bearing on homebuyers who were unable to take a home loan earlier due to eligibility issues.

""These fence sitters, as many as 2% to 3%, will now be able to make the cut. The first few months after the announcement would see a 5% to 6% percent increase in those applying for a home loan. The demand and supply equation would play out only after the first three months,"" said Rishi Mehra, CEO, Wishfin.

It is almost after a decade that the interest rate being offered is in the sub 8% range. This would even be lucrative for those who are staying on rent.

""Those paying a rent of around Rs 12,000 per month may now find it more viable to pay an EMI of around Rs 18,000 per month and build an asset in the process,"" he said.

The reduction in interest rates over the last one year by almost 135 bps is what has made housing affordable and that is the reason behind the increase in home sales in the last few months, said Pankaj Kapoor, founder and managing director, Liases Foras.

""There have been issues such as economic slowdown, GST and regulatory roadblocks that have created hurdles and not made reduction in home loan rates as effective. But now with property prices having come down by almost 6% to 7% plus interest rate, not to mention builder discounts, affordability is bound to improve,"" he said.

Having said that, interest rate is just one of the motivators and not the only reason for people to plunge into a property purchase. Buyers would first want to ensure that their jobs are secure before going in for a long term liability such as a home loan. Other factors that they may consider include builder reputation which makes it safer to purchase a ready-to-move in property rather than an under construction one, he says.

Also, more initiatives must be taken to improve housing demand, The Budget should introduce more tax reforms, perhaps offer full interest rate exemption to first time homebuyers to stimulate property sales and offer more sops for the under construction segment, he added."
"January 02, 2020 02:23 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/why-the-hype-on-banks-cutting-lending-rates-is-a-non-event-for-the-average-home-loan-borrower-4780211.html,"State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, recently slashed its external benchmark based rate (EBR) by 25 basis points (bps) to 7.8 percent per annum from 8.05 percent earlier, effective January 1. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. The latest reduction make SBI’s home loan rate the lowest among major lenders in the industry.

In theory, borrowers should be rejoicing. And many headlines in the media are terming SBI’s rate cut as a big bonanza for the home loan borrowers in the form of cheaper equated monthly instalments (EMIs). But on a closer look, it is evident that home loan borrowers have little to be excited about.

Consider a borrower who has taken a Rs 20 lakh home loan for 20 years. A back of the envelope calculation using the SBI’s recent cut as the basis, shows that the borrower’s EMI will reduce to Rs 16,605 from Rs 16,916 earlier. In other words, the borrower is going to save just Rs 311 monthly on account of this rate cut. For a loan size of Rs 40 lakh, the saving would be Rs 622. While a saving nevertheless, it would be a stretch to call it a ‘relief’.

Now this is only for SBI. Other banks typically follow SBI cues but may go for smaller rate cuts. In most cases, banks may choose 10-15 bps to save their margins. This, using the above calculation, would mean the monthly savings of the borrower will be even less. Many banks had cut their MCLR rates by 10-15 bps after RBI kept the policy rate unchanged in the last policy review.

Remember, banks have been extremely hesitant to pass on the benefit of RB rate cuts to the end-borrower.

In the current rate cut cycle, the RBI has cut its repo rate -- the rate at which it lends short-term funds to banks -- by 135 bps, whereas even banks like SBI has at best passed on about 65-70 bps. If one look at the industry average, this figure could be actually 40-45 bps. Remember, the EBR isn’t the final rate at which banks lend money to the home loan borrower. Banks add premium to individual borrower depending their risk profile and there will be a reset clause on rates as well. All this means, the final rate at which a home buyer get money will be higher than what is advertised.

Eager to protect their net interest margins (NIMs), banks have largely ignored RBI’s calls for monetary policy transmission. NIM is the difference between interest earned and interest paid out. Even during the time of D Subbarao at RBI, the central bank and banks have scrapped on the issue of inadequate monetary policy transmission.

One other way of to understand how rate cuts doesn’t mean much to the borrower is to look at the trend in the home loan market. According to RBI data, in the first eight months of this fiscal, home loan growth has actually declined to 9.9 percent as against 10.6 percent in the corresponding period in the previous fiscal.

This was the period when many banks began cutting their lending rates in small quantum. If the rate cuts translated into meaningful benefits for home loan buyers, loan growth should have picked up commensurately.

The problem here may not be the cost of home loans; rather it is the cost of real estate.

“Until property prices correct significantly, it is very difficult to revive demand in the residential real estate market. Lending rate cuts can be an enabler for revival, adding to positive sentiments and a directionally positive move but isn’t the decisive factor,” said Siddarth Purohit, analyst at SMC Global Securities.

According to Purohit, unless the real estate cartels are willing to cut prices by at least 30-40 percent, it is difficult to bring back demand to the residential real estate segment. This is also true for corporations, where capacity utilisation is the bigger cause of concern than interest costs.

With the economy in a downturn, there are not enough takers for the goods produced by firms.

The economy grew at 4.5 percent in the second quarter, performing even worse than the 5 percent growth logged in the first quarter. There aren’t signs of a strong rebound as of yet.

The bottomline is this: Banks will have to slash their lending rates by another 30-40 bps from the current level, if the common borrower needs to benefit on his monthly EMI burden in a meaningful manner. Marginal rate cuts make for good headlines, but doesn’t help anyone."

State Bank of India (SBI) is examining the possibility of floating a distressed asset fund in 2020, Business Standard reported. The size of the distressed asset fund may be as much as $2 billion, SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar told the publication. It will likely be formed along the lines of the government’s alternative investment fund (AIF).

“We are expanding our fund management business. At present, SBICAP Ventures -- the fund management arm of the group -- is managing a realty fund. It is looking at a distressed asset fund too,” he said.

SBICAP Ventures is looking to raise money from an international partner, Kumar told the paper. “SBICAP Ventures can float such a fund (for stressed assets) only when it has commitment from a strong international partner. Negotiations are going on. The realty fund has given us a lot of confidence,” he said.

SBI and Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) have contributed 10 percent each to the AIF out of the Rs 10,530 crore. The fund was launched in November 2019.

SBI Chairman also highlighted some reasons why foreign investors are eyeing India’s stressed assets market, which include supply of stressed assets, regulatory transparency and robustness, and potential for greater returns than similar assets globally.

Kumar also spoke about the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). “IBC is a big success story with the Supreme Court clearing all issues. Ruchi Soya and RattanIndia Power have been resolved in December quarter. The process of resolving cases like Reliance Communications and Alok Industries is underway and likely to be resolved in the March-June quarter,” Kumar stated."

Because of the reduction in the rate, existing loans linked to the EBR will get reduced by 25 basis points. It will affect both micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) borrowers and home loan customers.

The new home buyers will get loans at an interest rate starting from 7.90 percent per annum compared to earlier 8.15 percent per annum, it said.

Shares of PSU banks corrected further on December 24 after the Maharashtra government announced farm loan waiver package.

The Nifty PSU Bank index itself fell 0.2 percent at the time of publishing this copy. The index had fallen over a percent in the previous session.

The Maharashtra government on December 21 announced a loan waiver of up to Rs two lakh for farmers with a cut off date of September 30, 2019.

""Crop loans outstanding till September 30, 2019, will be waived by my government. The upper ceiling for the amount is Rs two lakh. The scheme will be called Mahatma Jyotirao Phule loan waiver scheme,"" Thackeray had said.

Besides, a special scheme would be offered for the farmers who repay their loans on time, he added.

Allahabad Bank, SBI, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Union Bank, Central Bank, PNB, Bank of India and Canara Bank were down 0.2-0.8 percent in the morning.

""Frequent occurrence of actions like loan waivers lead to risk of impaired credit discipline. Public banks face greater impact than private banks in the case of loan waivers,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities.

Loan waiver has a negative impact on asset quality & growth, it added.

Public banks have around 50 percent share in farm credit.

""The previous waiver (by previous government) has had a negative impact on asset quality and growth in the agricultural loan portfolio in the state. As per a recent RBI report, Maharashtra has seen a sharp rise in agriculture loan NPLs in FY18 from less than 10 percent in FY17 to around 17 percent in FY18, indicating a likely deterioration in credit discipline as a result of the loan waiver announced in Q1FY18,"" Kotak said.

The previous government had announced a loan waiver scheme in June 2017, ‘Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Sanman Yojana’, which entailed a total cost of Rs 34,000 crore for crop loans and medium term agricultural loans of up to Rs 1.5 lakh and incentives for farmers repaying loans on time. However, post verification the total cost of the scheme came down to Rs 24,000 crore sanctioned to 5 million borrowers.

""The payouts to banks are still being disbursed even as a fresh loan waiver scheme was announced last week. It took a reasonably long time to formalize the scheme, account for the borrowers and reimburse the banks. Of the total scheme cost of Rs 24,000 crore, only Rs 18,600 crore had been disbursed as of August 2019, of which around Rs 14,500 crore was paid in FY2019,"" Kotak said.

""It remains to be seen (1) how existing borrowers who have already benefitted from the previous scheme would be accounted under this scheme, (2) the impact on NPLs as it already high from this segment of borrowers.

We feel that the Nifty50 could see resistance closer to 12,300 levels, and should trade in a range between 12,000 and 12,300 levels till the end of December 2019, Rusmik Oza, Sr. VP & Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Q) A historic week for Indian markets. Do you think the momentum will continue as we step into the final six days of 2019?

A) The Nifty50 has broken out from the previous peak and is trading at fresh highs. We feel that the Nifty50 could see resistance closer to 12,300 levels, and should trade in a range between 12,000 and 12,300 levels till the end of December 2019. It is possible for the index to breakout above 12,300 in January 2020 on the back of a potential pre-budget rally.

Q) We have seen a wide divergence between the stocks which are hitting a 52-week low. On average there are almost double the stocks that have hit a 52-week low as compared to stocks that hit 52-week high? Does this bother you?

A) We are not so bothered by the polarisation of the market as this could throw the opportunity to make money in many beaten-down stocks in 2020. This year’s rally has been driven by FPIs and has been restricted to mainly large-cap stocks.

Even within Nifty50, the rally is very concentrated in the top 15-20 companies in terms of market capitalization. For example, in CY19 till date, only 16 stocks within Nifty50 have beaten the index whereas there are 23 stocks with absolute negative returns.

As Nifty50 trades into a new zone, we could see a catch-up in the mid & small-caps and also many beaten down large-caps in 2020.

Q) The coming week will be truncated as we approach the Christmas holiday. Can we say that the much talked about Santa Claus rally has already begun? Santa has already given the gift to D-Street with Sensex and Nifty touching record highs?

A) The convergence of positive news flows has led to a year-end rally in global and domestic equity markets. After infusing $5 billion in October, and November, FPI flows have slowed down to $477 million in December.

As we go into the last week of December 2019, FPI activity will further slowdown which could lead to some pause in the market.

Q) With benchmark indices sitting at record highs, can you give us three stocks that are ripe for a breakout and can be considered a good buy on dips stocks? Please mention the time frame with the call.

A) Three stocks that are ripe for break out are SBI (12 month Fair Value of Rs 400), Escorts (12 month Fair Value of Rs 1,030) and Petronet LNG (12 month Fair Value of Rs 320)

On rate transmission by banks, Kumar said when interest rate moves downwards then everybody starts talking and when it goes upwards nobody talks about it.

When the repo rates were going up five-six years back, interest rates for borrowers did not increase in that proportion, he said.

In 2013, the repo rate was around 10 percent, the SBI Chairman said adding that since 2013, Reserve Bank's repo and bank interest rates for consumers have been moving in a completely aligned manner.

""Secondly, we have repeatedly mentioned that banking system's dependence ...in India is largely on depositors. Today, 90 percent of my deposit is retail deposit. If I want to lend money cheap, obviously I will have to pay less to depositors; and in a country like ours where there is huge population of senior citizens and in the absence of social security schemes, the interest on deposits is a source of earning,"" Kumar said while speaking at the 92nd Ficci Annual Convention here on the theme 'making financial system robust to aspire a $5 trillion economy'.

At present, banks largely offer 3 to 4 percent interest on deposits in savings accounts, and charge borrowers 8 percent and above rate on loans.

On getting competition from government saving schemes, he said such instruments do not impact the banks much as they still command huge share in the deposit market.

""We can't lower the interest rates (on lending) without lowering the interest rates for depositors. And there is a point, a threshold below which we cannot reduce the interest rate for depositors. Third thing is that the credit cost in the country is very high because the default rates are very high, so the spread has to be necessarily high,"" said the head of the country's largest lender.

The loss due to defaults is very high currently and in such a scenario the spreads have to be necessarily high to cover for the credit costs, Kumar added."

Global financial services company Credit Suisse expects the economic slowdown to continue in 2020.

Earnings may bounce back and investing in ""safe stocks"" should be the prefered strategy for next year, the brokerage said in a report, India Market Strategy, released last week.

“Market performance in CY20 thought would be affected by how FY22 EPS moves—we expect this too to settle at a low to mid-teens growth on the reduced FY21 base. We expect narrow market performance to continue for now, as economic uncertainty continues to push funds into the safe stocks,” said the note.

For 2020, Credit Suisse has shifted to a more concentrated 30-stock portfolio where they have tried to reduce concentration risk by being more overweight on SBI than HDFC Bank.

The global investment bank will stay overweight on financials, telecom, utilities and metals. Pharma and IT also received minor uptick. It has a ‘Market Weight’ on staples and Underweight on discretionary cement, and industrials.

Top 30 stocks in Credit Suisse portfolio include RIL, HDFC Ltd, TCS, HUL, ICICI Bank, ITC, Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Finance, SBI, Tech Mahindra, Coal India, Dabur, Lupin, Chola Finance, ICICI Prudential, and Motherson Sumi.

Credit Suisse also highlighted ""quality bubble"" which is likely to remain inflated for some more time till growth comes back.

The global investment bank in the report highlighted that foreign investors reacted to the weak economic activity levels. FPIs too have been focusing on the top 100 names, though that has been their focus generally.

Almost 76 percent of the FPI holdings are in the Nifty stocks, compared to 66 percent for the domestic institutional holdings. This ratio for DIIs was 56 percent a year back.

As a result, performance is becoming lopsided, driven primarily by a select few large and liquid stocks, with the majority of stocks being 20-30 percent below their all-time highs even though most indexes are close to lifetime highs.

“Till growth uncertainty continues (we expect for another six months), we expect this “quality bubble” to stay inflated and market concentration to remain high,” said the note.

Banks will continue to do well in 2020. Telecom and auto will be the other interesting sectors to focus in the coming year, Naveen Kulkarni, Head of Research, Reliance Securities, tells Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand in an interview.

Q) What is your outlook for 2020? The year 2019 is ending with gains of 10%. Do you think 2020 will be better?

A) The year 2020 should be the year of revival when we start witnessing a revival in the GDP growth rate. The policy actions taken by the government should start yielding results. The year 2020 will likely be better than 2019 for markets.

Q) Do you have a Sensex or Nifty target for 2020? What is the basis of your assessment?

A) Our April 2020 target for the Nifty 50 index is 12,800 and December 2020 Nifty50 index target is 13,900. Our December target is based on 19x FY21 Nifty 50 earnings.

Q) What are your expectations from the budget? Will we see a personal tax cut in the coming year and will it be good for equity markets?

A) There are good chances of personal income tax rate being cut but the fiscal challenges for the government are also quite daunting.

The personal tax rate cut will provide a major boost to discretionary consumption and will be a key positive for the markets.

Q) Which are the sectors likely to hog the limelight in 2020 and why?

A) Banks will continue to do well in 2020. Apart from banks, telecom and auto will be the other interesting sectors to focus on in 2020.

Telecom is seeing a surge in tariffs and sustainability of that will be critical. Demand revival will mean autos will benefit. The base for the sector is quite low and any revival will mean a very high growth rate and sector re-rating.

Q) Any top 5 stocks that you think are available at attractive valuations and can be considered a buy on dips?

A) Top 5 stocks that are attractive buy on dips are: SBI, Axis Bank , Ashok Leyland, Infosys and Bharti Airtel.

Q) What should be the investment philosophy in 2020?

A) Investment philosophy will continue to be plays based on economic revival, as they will see maximum delta. Focus on largecap value and quality midcaps will be critical themes for 2020.

Q) Do you think growth bottomed out in the September quarter? Will small and midcaps outperform largecaps in 2020?

A) Yes, growth should start improving and quality mid and smallcaps should outperform the large-cap stocks in 2020.

Q) Do you think earnings will start looking up from FY21?

A) Yes, earnings growth will improve as the base of operating profit is soft, which is very likely to improve in FY21.

Q) What are your key takeaways from 2019?

A) The year 2019 was a volatile year and stock picking has been a challenge. The biggest lesson from 2019 is that quality management delivers value sustainably over long periods.

SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar on December 17 said it will take up to three years more to list its general insurance arm. The bank will list its asset management company before SBI General Insurance, Kumar said while speaking at the India Economic Conclave organised by Times Network here.

SBI had last year listed its life insurance arm and the proceeds came in handy to fight difficulties in asset quality. It is also planning to part-sell its stake in SBI Cards.

SBI General Insurance, which is a joint venture with Insurance Australia Group, has to ""mature"" and will await the valuation to touch Rs 50,000 crore, Kumar said.

""We are discussing but if you ask me sequentially then it will be AMC first then SBI General because. We believe that still it is about 2-3 years away before SBI General matures,"" he said.

Speaking on the asset quality position, Kumar reiterated that non-performing assets had touched a peak last quarter and there will be an improvement from this quarter onwards.

On telecom exposure, Kumar said the bank had burnt its ""fingers and body"" in the past, but sounded more confident for the sector now.

He said the risk is a ""lot less"" now and also added that the bank is in a position to absorb setbacks, if any, in the future.

The bank is not getting much of demand for large projects given the state of the economy and the project loans are much smaller now, Kumar said.

Amid a sustained period of liquidity surplus, he said availability of money to fund the debt requirements of corporates is not the problem, but it is equity raising which is proving to be a difficulty.

Companies are facing difficulties for equity raising due to a slew of concerns, including the general economic scenario and the low investor confidence due to setbacks like losing money in the past.

Kumar said he does not see any ""major changes"" when it comes to consolidation of state-owned banks.

He, however, hinted that state ownership of lenders limits the discretion of the management in taking business decisions as compared to private sector rivals.

""When you are a private bank, you still have a choice in terms of selecting your client. In SBI, you don't have that choice at times, even if business is not generating profits,"" he said.

The SBI chief also admitted that the lender has not delivered to equity investors, but sought the bank to be evaluated on the basis of ""stakeholder value"" that it is generating.

The equity valuations are suppressed because of a ""small segment"" not representing over 10 per cent of the balancesheet, which pulls down the performance, Kumar said.

Rather than looking at returns for equity holders by way of share price appreciation, there is a need to look at wider ""stakeholder returns"" which more number of people across the world are tracking, he said.

Kumar said SBI does not need any capital from the government and will depend on internal accruals and profits itself for its buffers, and also exhorted its peers to do the same."

A consortium of Indian public sector banks led by State Bank of India (SBI) are back in the UK high court to seek a bankruptcy order against liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya over the alleged unpaid debt of around 1.145 billion pounds.

Judge Michael Briggs is presiding over a hearing in the insolvency division of the court in London this week in relation to a bankruptcy petition filed by the banks back in 2018 in their attempt to recoup unpaid debt accrued by the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.

A previous UK High Court ruling had refused to overturn a worldwide order freezing Mallya's assets and upheld an Indian court's ruling that the consortium of 13 Indian banks were entitled to recover funds amounting to nearly 1.145 billion pounds.

The banks then launched efforts to recover dues as part of the freezing order, with the bankruptcy petition aimed at seizing UK-based Mallya's assets to recover the dues.

Besides SBI, the 13 Indian banks include Bank of Baroda, Corporation Bank, Federal Bank, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt Ltd.

They have secured follow-on High Court orders to recover some of the funds owed to them as a result of Kingfisher Airlines' unpaid loans.

In July, the banks had won a High Court battle to access documents they were after to establish the true ownership of assets they believed were linked with the embattled liquor tycoon.

“Frankly, the answer needs to be known as to which assets are that of Mr Mallya, both for the purpose of the worldwide freezing order and enforcement of the judgment,” Justice Robin Knowles had ruled.

Two superyachts, a game reserve in South Africa, numerous undeclared high-value and vintage cars, valuable paintings and a piano previously owned by famous British singer-songwriter Elton John were among some of the assets on their target list.

The true ownership of a plush home overlooking Regent's Park in the heart of London also remains in contention.

Mallya's legal team has argued that the petition for bankruptcy in the UK should be dismissed because the banks are pursuing the same debt through the Indian courts.

The lawyers have also sought a stay on proceedings until Mallya's appeal against his extradition order, scheduled in the Royal Courts of Justice in London, is heard in February next year.

Meanwhile, Mallya remains on bail pending the appeal hearing in the extradition proceedings brought by India in relation to charges of fraud and money laundering amounting to an alleged Rs 9,000 crores.

He had been arrested on an extradition warrant back in April 2017 and has been fighting his extradition in the UK courts since then."

Shares of State Bank of India fell a percent intraday on December 10 after reporting about Rs 12,000 crore divergence in their bad loans for fiscal 2018-19.

This could be one of the reasons for correction in Nifty PSU Bank index that fell 1.4 percent at the time of publishing this copy. State Bank of India was down 0.71 percent at Rs 314.50.

Allahabad Bank, J&K Bank, Central Bank of India, Union Bank, Syndicate Bank, PNB, Indian Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Bank of India and Bank of Baroda were down 1-5 percent.

As per the assessment done by the RBI, the gross NPA of the country's largest lender was Rs 11,932 crore more at Rs 1,84,682 as against Rs 1,72,750 reported by the bank for 2018-19, SBI said in a regulatory filing.

Similarly, the net NPA was 77,827 crore as compared to disclosed figure of Rs 65,895 crore, reflecting divergence of Rs 11,932 crore, it said.

As a result, the bank has to make additional provisioning of Rs 12,036 crore in the balance sheet and the notional loss would have been at Rs 6,968 crore.

SBI had posted a profit of Rs 862 crore for 2018-19 in May this year.

It further said after subsequent slippage or upgradation during the current financial year, the remaining impact on the gross NPAs during the third quarter of current fiscal is Rs 3,143 core. The impact on provisioning during the third quarter stood at Rs 4,654 crore, it added.

RSI stands for Relative Strength Index. It is a momentum oscillator used to identify trend reversal. RSI was invented by Welles Wilder Junior. The default look-back period for RSI is 14, however, this can be lowered to increase sensitivity and vice versa. RSI calculates strength of stock trend and helps to predict their reversals.

Why to Buy State Bank of India (SBIN)?

There are a lot of trading strategies using RSI; below mentioned is one of the most popular among the trading community which involves buying after completing retracement for higher movement; however, the support of another momentum oscillator, stochastic, can give additional support.

In the last few sessions, RSI had a breakout trading above 50 levels from below and made a high of 75 then after it is trading lower or retracing towards the centerline placed at 50 levels. This behaviour is called ‘RSI PBB’ setup. RSI PBB is pull back buy setup, which indicates once RSI turns its tail upside after taking support from the zone of 45-55 levels, the target is previous swing high of RSI which was 75 or previous swing high of prices.

Currently, SBIN is going through this setup and we expect higher price movement towards previous high Rs 350-360 levels in coming days.

"December 07, 2019 01:51 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mutual-funds/uti-amc-psus-sebi-saga-is-it-a-special-case-treatment-of-sebi-relenting-with-extension-for-stakeholders-sbi-lic-and-bob-4708001.html,"Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in an order dated December 6, 2019, revealed charging a show-cause notice on stakeholders of UTI Asset Management Company (AMC) - State Bank of India, Life Insurance Corporation, and Bank of Baroda on July 19, 2019, towards regulatory action.

The market regulator directed three public sector financial institutions -- LIC, SBI, and Bank of Baroda -- to dilute their stakes to below 10 percent in by December next year.

In the case of non-compliance with directions, the shareholding and voting rights of these entities in UTI AMC and UTI Trustee in excess of 9.99 percent and corporate benefits will be frozen till the time they comply with the orders.

The stakeholding of SBI, BoB, and LIC in UTI AMC is in contravention of an amendment to SEBI MF Regulations on March 13, 2018, requiring an asset management company (AMC) to be a sponsor and stakeholder holding 10 percent or more, of only one mutual fund, thereby reducing cross-holding in any other AMC at less than 10 percent.

For AMC companies holding more than one mutual fund in a one-year timeline was given to comply.

At present SBI, LIC, BoB, each hold nearly 18.5 percent stake in UTI AMC besides having their own independent mutual fund houses. Punjab National Bank also holds 18.5 percent stake in UTI AMC. However, it does not own a mutual fund house.

Subsequent to SEBI Regulations enforced on having multiple stakes in AMC, SBI, LIC, and BoB were expected to comply within a year by March 2019 which did not go through.

SBI, LIC and BoB defended their status saying divestment needed approval through Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), a government of India body.

'Not Satisfied with the replies', says the SEBI order although looking at facts and circumstances of the case, SEBI has now allowed timeline till December 31, 2020, for compliance by SBI, LIC, and BoB.

SEBI vs PSU MFs

It's a curious case of a handful of PSU enterprises falling on the wrong side of regulatory compliance for the want of timely divestment in UTI AMC, another government entity.

This is of significance because, for long, government financial bodies have had cross-holdings in each other.

In mutual funds, insurance and development financial institution, cross-holdings by public sector enterprises in one another has been more pronounced in order to set up equity capital.

A foremost benchmark of SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations are avoidance of conflict of interest in organising and operating mutual fund operations. This is so since in asset management business, returns of schemes of one AMC are always competing with returns of schemes of another AMC and for getting investor's corpus.

“For best governance standards without interest conflicts in the asset management business, its imperative for each MF player to have one AMC and not duplicate,” quoted an ex- SEBI mutual fund department officer who is now an investor.

“What scrip one AMC may be buying in its long term value oriented scheme, another AMC may be selling in its sectoral equity scheme, such conflicts arise when there is holding in multiple AMCs,” added the ex SEBI officer.

With the creation of autonomous financial regulators towards setting governance norms and fair play, public sector players are now subject to the same rules and regulations that govern the entire sector.

In that line of equality for all MF players, SEBI came up with the aforementioned amendment in MF Regulations, implying that each MF player holds a controlling stake in only one mutual fund.

Background

UTI Mutual Fund, originally founded as the country's first asset management company in 1964 has had SBI and LIC as its founding members.

Later, stakes were taken up by BoB and global asset manager Luxembourg-based T Rowe Price.

There has been a buzz for two years of divestment by them in UTI through an IPO process but it did not go through due to differences with T Rowe Price.

Meanwhile, Nippon AMC and HDFC successfully launched their IPOs. Else, UTI AMC would have been the first AMC to get listed on the exchanges.

Miffed with non-compliance, SEBI may have issued the recent show-cause notice on SBI, LIC and BoB on July 19, 2019, towards regulatory action that saw its closure with SEBI allowing extension by a year till end December 2020 for SBI, LIC and BoB to divest stake in UTI MF.

“It seems matters reached the echelons of Ministry of Finance towards a closure to the issue and it was ensured that SBI, BoB and LIC step out as stakeholders of UTI MF and end the conflict of their interest with their own MFs, the SBI MF, LIC MF and BoB MF,” said an industry source.

“It's an ironical case where the right arm of Government I.e. say ministry along with SBI, LIC, BoB was not acutely aware that left arm of Government I.e. say SEBI took a serious view of of regulatory non compliance. But the time extension for SBI, LIC and BoB has come when there are credible buzz that UTI is in throes of its IPO launch to mop up Rs 10,000 crore with these three entities divesting their stake,” the source added.

Why the delay?

Part of dilly-dallying on stake sale is partly because of the rift between UTI stakeholders and T Rowe Price that has been going on for the last six years, back when T Rowe Price wanted a professional CEO to be appointed instead of an IAS on deputation.

Leo Puri was appointed Chairman in 2013 completing a five-year term in August 2018. UTI MF is operating through interim Chairman Imtiyazur Rehman since then.

Industry experts said that if there is a delay in appointing full-time Chairman it will also delay the IPO process, stake sale of SBI, LIC and BoB which may again brush against regulatory extended deadlines.

Government authorities and PSU bodies need to understand that governance practices mean equal standard for all, whether public sector enterprise or corporate.

The investor community takes note of it all. SEBI held its ground on regulatory fairness by not exempting SBI, LIC and BoB from divestment, only extended the deadline."

Nepal SBI Bank, a subsidiary of State Bank of India, has posted a Rs 229.25 crore net profit for 2018-19, registering a growth of 13.29 percent.

The bank mobilised total deposit of Rs 9,72.44 crore and extended loans and advances of Rs 8,864.47 crore at the closing of the year, according to a statement issued by the bank ahead of its Annual General Meeting.

Speaking at a press briefing, Nepal SBI Managing Director Anukul Bhatnagar said that the banking sector of Nepal should jointly fight against possible cyber attacks as leakage of information of one bank could jeopardize the performance of the entire banking system.

The bank has decided to distribute a 16.84 percent bonus including 6 percent bonus share and 10.84 percent cash dividends from the last year's profit and accumulated profits of the past, he informed.

The bank will organise its 26th AGM on December 15 in Kathmandu.

The bank succeeded in opening 76,568 new saving accounts during the last fiscal year.

The bank will leverage its position to expand the customer base by exploring new market segments and expanding delivery channels for its products, the statement said."

In the case of non-compliance with directions, the shareholding and voting rights of these entities in UTI AMC and UTI Trustee in excess of 9.99 per cent and corporate benefits will be frozen till the time they comply with the orders.

UTI AMC is promoted by four public sector financial institutions as sponsors -- State Bank of India (SBI), Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), Bank of Baroda (BoB) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) -- with each of them presently holding 18.24 per cent stake in the fund house, while private equity firm T Rowe Price International holds 26 per cent stake in UTI AMC.

Sebi observed that LIC, SBI and BoB are the sponsors of LIC Mutual Fund, SBI Mutual Fund and Baroda Mutual Fund, respectively, and they also hold more than 10 per cent stake each in these mutual funds.

In addition, LIC, SBI and BoB are also sponsors of UTI AMC and hold more than 10 per cent stake individually in the AMC and trustee company of UTIMF.

""The noticees (LIC, SBI and BoB) are sponsors of more than one mutual fund and hold more than 10 per cent shareholding in more than one AMC and trustee company and, hence, are not in compliance with the requirements of ...the MF regulations,"" Sebi said in an order.

Sebi amended the mutual fund regulations in March 2018, wherein a shareholder or a sponsor owning at least 10 per cent stake in an AMC is not allowed to have 10 per cent or more stake in another mutual fund house operating in the country.

In addition, such entities are not allowed to have a representation on the board of another mutual fund house.

Entities not in compliance with the requirement was given time up to March 2019 to comply with the requirement.

Besides, it was alleged that LIC and SBI had nominated directors on the board of UTI AMC.

In their reply to Sebi, they said they had nominated directors in accordance with the provisions in the shareholder agreement and further clarified that such nominees were also not their directors. It was also submitted that none of the working employees of LIC or SBI were on the board of UTI AMC or UTI Trustee and the nominated directors did not have any reporting relationship with the two companies.

Sebi said that despite the expiry of over 20 months from the date of amendment of the regulations, the three entities are yet to achieve compliance with these requirements. While they have shown that they have initiated some steps to dilute their stake in UTI AMC, the substantial compliance with the regulation ""still remains pending"".

Accordingly, the regulator has said that the voting rights of LIC, SBI and BoB in UTI AMC and UTI Trustee shall be brought down below 10 per cent on or before December 31, 2020.

Also, they have been asked to take suitable steps to ensure compliance with regards to board composition.

""In the event of non-compliance with the aforesaid directions, the shareholding and voting rights of the noticees in UTI AMC and UTI Trustee in excess of 9.99 per cent and corporate benefits thereon shall stand frozen till such time the noticees comply with the aforesaid directions,"" it added."

One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.

“It is very difficult to read into the minds of the MPC but 50 basis points (bps) rate cut, to me, seems to be a very ambitious expectation,” said Kumar in an interview with CNBC-TV18 on December 4.

The central bank will be announcing the fiscal year's fifth bi-monthly policy statement on December 5.

“As the interest rates go down and the equated monthly instalment (EMI) goes down, it may give further push as far as the retail loans are concerned,"" said Kumar.

Speaking about credit demand, Kumar said, “There has been a big push around retail, MSME loans and corporate loans. The utilisation of the working capital is yet to pick up and there are many sanctioned term loans where disbursements are yet to happen. Hopefully, there will be demand for funds from the corporate sector.”

“There are higher NPAs in the MUDRA loans but the size of these loans and the portfolios with each bank is not very high in percentage terms,"" added Kumar.

Talking about Jaypee Infratech, Kumar said that there is a possibility that over a period of time the lenders may be able to recover their entire money.

In terms of DHFL, he said, “There is a lot of interest. Initial interest is good because the retail franchise of DHFL was very good, let us hope for the best. There will be a process of inviting expression of interest (EoI). Whatever best offer in terms of the enterprise value is received, the administrator, committee of creditors (CoC) and ultimately it has to be approved by the regulator. So in the next two months, we will have clarity.”

The Sensex hit a record high of 41,120.28, while the Nifty50 climbed to 12,132.45 before witnessing profit-taking towards the close of the session.

Experts say the Nifty rally could extend towards 12,300-12,400 in the near-term. The euphoria is likely to continue in the short-term on the back of strong global cues, buying by foreign investors, reforms by the government, expectations of a revival in earnings growth and consistent money coming into markets via mutual funds.

In hitting fresh highs, Indian markets are following other developed markets and emerging markets like Brazil, Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO, HDFC Securities told Moneycontrol.

“We at HDFC Securities had forecasted a Nifty target of 12,400 in December 2018 and now we are almost there. FIIs have largely been bullish on the Indian market in November, investing around Rs 18,200 crore till 25th,” Relli said.

“Most of the drivers of the current slowdown appear to be temporary and related to channel financing/GST credit issues. Companies that are able to gain market share from their competitors have been less impacted by the slowdown.”

Relli expects earnings to recover faster with FY20 and FY21 earnings growth being driven by lower corporate tax rates and lower loan-loss provisions. “We remain positive on BFSI, consumer stocks, PSU and Digital/internet stocks. Greater visibility of resumption of corporate earnings growth is necessary for the Nifty to move beyond 12,400,” Relli said.

The government has taken several measures to revive growth and more are expected, and dips, if any, should be used to accumulate quality stocks.

“The Nifty finally managed to touch new high today on the back of strong global cues, FII buying and improvement in market sentiments post a slew of government reforms,” Siddhartha Khemka, Head – Retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Private Ltd, told Moneycontrol.

“While Nifty50 valuation at 22x FY20 is not cheap, we believe that the current momentum can sustain in the near term on the back of liquidity flows and positive sentiments.”

Largest lender SBI does not ""mind"" its lower stock valuation compared to leaner private sector players due to state ownership and social sector focus, but admitted that it needs to improve on commercial decisions.

Speaking at an event organised by former Sebi chief M Damodaran here on November 21, Arijit Basu, a managing director at SBI, also conceded that the bank has erred on some business decisions and cannot attribute those to social compulsions.

SBI's market capitalisation on Friday stood at a low Rs 2.95 lakh crore, which is just about 42 percent of private sector HDFC Bank's Rs 7.02 lakh crore, while SBI's loan-book is Rs 22.48 lakh crore, and the same for HDFC Bank is under Rs 9 lakh crore.

""If our market cap is slightly lower...we do not mind that. We are absolutely fine with that,"" Basu said and partly blamed it on government ownership, which plays an important part in the market's calls on valuations and asserted that the bank is proud of its work on the social uplift front and infrastructure building because of the state ownership.

But he was quick to add that SBI is a ""commercial organisation with a difference...we have to start with the premise that certain objectives of the government of the day and for the society at large, cannot be done away with,"" he said, adding organisations like SBI exist because of the societal challenges.

He, however, conceded that some commercial decisions taken by the bank in the past decade have been wrong and it cannot blame the social sector mandates for such decisions.

""On the commercial part, as a bank we feel that there is scope to improve. While there have been ecosystem problems, we would be foolish to state that in the last 10 years, we have not made mistakes in our business itself as those were taken with no social compulsion at all,"" he added.

Basu said there are also some benefits of the societal outlook of SBI, saying it helps it access low cost deposits, and that the market rewards the bank when it does good commercially like the recent spike in valuations after a favourable judgement in the Essar Steel case."

Shares of public-sector banks extended previous day's gains on November 18 after the Supreme Court of India said the resolution of Essar Steel would proceed as per the October 2018 plan, clearing the way for ArcelorMittal to acquire the bankrupt company.

All brokerage houses remained bullish on SBI and ICICI Bank, which would be biggest beneficiaries in resolution of IBC (insolvency and bankruptcy code) cases, including Essar Steel.

The Nifty PSU Bank itself gained nearly a percent on top of 3.3 percent gains in the previous session. Jammu & Kashmir Bank, SBI, Indian Bank, Syndicate Bank, Central Bank, Canara Bank, Union Bank, PNB, Bank of Baroda and Bank of India rose 0.5-2 percent while Corporation Bank rallied 16 percent on top of 17 percent rally in the previous trading session.

Essar Steel was one of 12 systemically large non-performing assets (NPAs) that the RBI had directed banks to refer to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). Financial creditors had an exposure of Rs 49,500 crore, while operational creditors had an exposure of Rs 19,700 crore, as per July 2019 NCLT documents.

As per the October 2018 resolution plan, secured financial creditors will recover 92 percent of their exposure--Rs 42,000 crore--to Essar Steel, while operational and unsecured creditors make very low recoveries-- 2-4 percent.

""Effectively, the court’s judgment sets forth two important precedents which are significant positives for future IBC-led resolutions, in our view: a) financial creditors are to be given precedence over the operational creditors (ex-workmen and employees) and b) NCLT cannot dictate distribution of recovery proceeds, which are determined by the Committee of Creditors. For our coverage universe, significant non-performing loans (NPL) recoveries are to be made by ICICI Bank/Axis Bank/SBI, and we remain constructive on these names,"" JM Financial said.

According to the brokerage house, healthy recoveries were also expected for Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and PNB. It expects banks to have a high provision cover (in some cases 100 percent) on this exposure, given Essar has been an NPA for the sector since March 2016 – hence, most of the loan recovery should flow through the P&L as provision writebacks / recoveries from written-off accounts.

""HDFC Bank is our top pick in the sector, while we remain constructive on ICICI Bank and Axis Bank,"" JM Financial said.

JP Morgan said SBI and ICICI Bank were best exposed to play resolution cycle. Hence, the brokerage has a target for ICICI Bank at Rs 560, implying a 12 percent potential upside from current levels, and SBI at Rs 375, upside of 16.5 percent.

""The Supreme Court notification of Essar Steel resolution is a landmark judgment. Stressed NBFC resolution framework is positive,"" it said.

Japanese brokerage firm Nomura said the judgment favoured banks but key beneficiaries should be SBI and ICICI Bank.

""Recovery for banks in the case will be closer to 90 percent against 60 percent earlier. The judgment established Committee of Creditors' (CoC) primacy in allocating future proceeds from settlements. SBI could have a recovery of around Rs 12,000 crore as suggested by COC,"" it added.

Citi also remained positive on SBI, ICICI Bank and PSU banks having exposure to Essar Steel.

SBI expects around Rs 17,000 crore of recoveries from three cases under IBC. Out of the three cases, Essar Steel is the biggest.

""Secured financial creditors will be able to recover around 92 percent of dues to Essar Steel,"" said Citi.

SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar on November 15 said the Supreme Court's judgement in the Essar Steel case with regard to rights of various creditors during insolvency proceedings would significantly reduce the scope for long-drawn litigations and eventually lead to faster resolution of stressed assets.

The Supreme Court on November 15 set aside an NCLAT order which gave equal rights to the secured and unsecured creditors during the insolvency proceedings of debt-ridden Essar Steel, clearing the decks for its takeover by Lakshmi Mittal-led ArcelorMittal.

Setting aside the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order, a three-judge bench headed by Justice R F Nariman said the two sets of creditors will be treated differently during the insolvency proceedings and taking over of a debt-ridden firm by another company.

The Supreme Court has upheld that the ultimate discretion on distribution of funds is with the Committee of Creditors, Kumar said.

SBI, the country's largest bank, has an exposure of around Rs 14,000 crore in Essar Steel.

""This much awaited judgement also settles to rest numerous points of law under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code which were tested in various courts.

An SBI reserach report that was published on November 12 sharply cut the country's GDP growth forecast to 5 percent for FY 2019-20 from the earlier projection of 6.1 percent.

The second quarter GDP growth rate is likely to slip to 4.2 percent on account of low automobile sales, deceleration in air traffic movements, flattening of core sector growth and declining investment in construction and infrastructure, according to Ecowrap -- the report from the Economic Research Department of State Bank of India (SBI).

The report, however, said the economic growth rate will pick up pace in 2020-21 to 6.2 percent.

To propel economic growth, it said, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may go for ""larger rate cuts"" in December monetary policy review.

Last month, while reducing the key policy rate (repo) by 25 basis points for the fifth time in a row, the RBI had also reduced its growth forecast to 6.1 percent for 2019-20 from 6.9 percent.

Meanwhile, the SBI research report said, ""We are revising our GDP forecast for 2019-20 to 5 percent from 6.1 percent earlier.""

India's GDP growth had dipped to about a six-year low of 5 percent in the first quarter of the fiscal.

""We expect Q2GDP growth at 4.2 percent. Our acceleration rate for 33 leading indicators at 85 percent in October 2018 is down to just 17 percent in September 2019, with such decline gaining traction from March 2019,"" the report said, while terming the decline in September IIP by 4.3 percent as ""quite alarming"".

Ecowrap further said that the growth rate in 2019-20 ""should be looked"" through the prism of synchronised global slowdown (countries have witnessed 22-716 basis point decline between June 2018 and June 2019, and India cannot be isolated!).

""India is also significantly lower in Economic Uncertainty Index when compared globally!"

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increased the cash withdrawal limits to Rs 50,000 for customers of Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank this week and ordered reopening of its ATMs after a gap of two months.

While the move would allow 78 percent of the bank's depositors to withdraw their entire balance, it is still a long way to go for other customers whose retirement savings or business accounts are locked up in the bank.

Here are some of the key developments from the banking sector, from the last week:

PMC Bank: RBI increases deposit withdrawal limit to Rs 50,000, reopens ATMs

RBI has increased deposit withdrawal limit for Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank customers to Rs 50,000 from November 5. This includes the limit of Rs 40,000 that was relaxed earlier. The move will allow 78 percent of the bank's depositors to withdraw their entire account balance.

The Reserve Bank has also decided to allow depositors to withdraw cash from the bank's own ATMs within the relaxed limit of Rs 50,000.

Lenders count on government's realty fund for NPA relief

The Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), to be set up by the government to revive the housing sector, will come as a major relief to lenders that are looking to shed off bad loans stuck in stalled projects.

Deepak Parekh, chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), said that some developers have been facing troubles only due to a slowdown in sales and had to be declared as NPAs.

Tepid demand forces ICICI Bank to shutter project finance division

Private lender ICICI Bank disbanded its project finance division in September, owing to lack of fresh demand for loans in the infrastructure sector, according to an official.

While the bank is still open to lending opportunities in the sector, it has reallocated the specialised staff to its larger wholesale banking vertical that caters to clients across sectors.

With this reduction, the one year MCLR, to which most of its loan prices are linked, will come down to 8 per cent, the bank said in a statement.

The bank also revised its interest rates on term deposits on account of adequate liquidity in the system. The new deposit rates will also be effective from November 10.

Shares of State Bank of India climbed 10 percent intraday on October 31 after brokerage houses had retained their bullish stance on the stock as the management expects slippages to moderate from the next financial year 2020-2021.

The stock rallied 22 percent in last 15 days. It was quoting at Rs 312.60, up Rs 22.65, or 7.81 percent on the BSE at 1516 hours IST. In fact, the sentiment was also buoyed after strong earnings report last week.

Global brokerage house CLSA maintained its buy call on the stock with a target price at Rs 390 per share, implying 34.5 percent potential upside from current levels.

SBI on October 30 hosted Investor Day to showcase its restructured business/stress management verticals, future business strategy, including cross-selling opportunity, and underlying value in cards/insurance/AMC businesses, thereby claiming better valuations.

The management expects slippages to moderate from FY21 and said FY20 would see higher slippages, especially as large cases such as DHFL default.

Management sees slippage ratio falling below 2 percent in the current financial year and expects less than 1.3 percent for FY21 against 1.6 percent in FY19.

""Corporate slippages are seen around Rs 22,000 crore in FY20 and Rs 12,000 crore in FY21 against Rs 10,244 crore in FY19 while retail slippages in FY20 are seen around Rs 24,000 crore and Rs 20,000 crore in FY21 against Rs 22,494 crore in FY19,"" the bank said.

""Company is gaining share without having to offer high rates. Digital platforms are ahead of peers, with plans to extend them beyond retail. We believe SBI will see earnings recovery from FY20,"" said the brokerage, adding SBI remained its top PSU bank pick.

Emkay also maintained its buy/overweight call on the stock in its Emkay Alpha Portfolio with target price at Rs 350 (implying 21 percent potential upside from current levels), given bank's enviable franchisee, strong retailization/digitization, healthy capital and strong subsidiaries value.

However, near-term stock performance will track the outcome of corporate NPA recognition/resolutions, it said.

The bank now guided for 0.4-0.5 percent return on asset (RoA) in FY20 versus 0.75 percent earlier, factoring in higher LLP. It remained highly focused on improving its core operating profit & reaching RoAs towards 1.0 percent by end of FY21.

Emkay prefers to be conservative with the RoA estimate of 0.4 percent/0.6 percent in FY20/FY21, mainly factoring in higher LLP given continued lumpy corporate stress.

""No merger (voluntary/involuntary) in pipeline with bank/NBFC given its already high market share. Life, MF and Cards subsidiaries have gained sizeable market share and expects value unlocking via IPO in cards by January 2020,"" said the brokerage.

Prabhudas Lilladher said key enablers would be (i) improving NIMs from lower cost of funds, lower interest reversals and risk based pricing on loans (ii) steadying fee income generation & operating expenses control below 10 percent or cost-to-income ratio of 45 percent (from current 50-55 percent) and (iii) having the credit cost of lower than 100bps with slippages of 1.5 percent assuming LGDs of 50-60 percent in base line scenario.

According to the brokerage, the bank's baseline scenario of pre-provision operating profit Rs 65,000 crore and Rs 75,000 crore in FY20/FY21 can be achievable.

""But we vary on RoAs of 0.9-1.0 percent by FY21 as timing of provisions on new stressed assets will have to be upfront & write-back from recoveries can be delayed despite large cushion available,"" said the brokerage which retained buy rating with a revised target price of Rs 413-implying 42.4 percent potential upside from current levels (from Rs 396) - as it slightly increased valuations in subsidiaries with bank estimates unchanged.

The bank sees the provision coverage ratio improving to 84 percent in 2019 and further to 88 percent in 2020 against 78.73 percent in FY19. It expects the credit cost lower than 1.80 percent in the current financial year and less than 1 percent in FY21 against 2.66 percent in the previous year.

SBI will cut interest rates on savings accounts with a balance of up to Rs 1 lakh by 25 basis points. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. Savings account holders of the bank will now get 3. 25 percent interest instead of the current 3.5 percent. This decision to cut interest rates on saving accounts comes as the bank has enough liquidity.

“Overall, the baseline is Rs 32,000-34,000 crore for the bank, which is 1.6 percent of our current loan book. Ultimately, we have reached a situation where our gross slippages in not-so-good circumstances are not likely to exceed 2 percent,” Chairman Rajnish Kumar had said during press meet immediately after results announcement on October 25.

He added that the bank has started providing against slippages in advance, in alignment with the estimated costs. “Today, the provision which the bank is holding is more than the estimated loss given default,” Kumar had said.

SBI’s slippages halved in the September quarter to Rs Rs 8,805 crore, from Rs 16,212 crore in the previous quarter and Rs 10,725 crore in the same quarter last year. The bank’s slippage ratio eased to 2.18 percent in the second quarter, from 2.83 percent in the previous quarter.

As a result, its provision coverage ratio increased to 81.23 percent in the July-September period, as compared to 70.74 percent in the same quarter last year.

The index which is now trading above crucial short-term and long-term moving averages restored bullish bias. “The ongoing structural improvement makes us believe the index is set to challenge the all-time high of 12,100 in the coming months,” said the note.

“In the process, we do not foresee the index breaching the key support threshold of 11,300. Therefore, dips should be capitalised to accumulate quality stocks amid the Q2FY20 earning season,” it said.

The midcap has formed a strong base on the maturity of price/time-wise correction, as over the past 21-month index retraced 61.8% of preceding 22 months rally.

The slower pace of retracement signifies a robust price structure auguring well for the index to rally 5% from here on and challenge the long term falling trend line at 17000.

ICICIdirect recommends that investors should buy quality midcap stocks as the broader market looks lucrative to participate in the impending technical pullback.

Top lenders in India posted their second quarter results this week, with fewer additions to bad loans. However, bank chiefs expressed concerns on the impact of slowdown and delay in resolution of large accounts on the asset quality and credit costs going forward.

ICICI Bank says asset quality steady as slippages ease in Q2

ICICI Bank said that fresh additions to bad loans had stabilized, which led to overall improvement in its asset quality. However, there was an uptick in the lender’s watchlist over concerns of an economic slowdown. The total slippages for the quarter were Rs 2,482 crore, lower than around Rs 2,800 crore in the previous quarter and Rs 3,100 crore in the same period in 2018.

SBI says fresh additions to bad loans will further ease by March 2020

In what seems to be a relief from incurring heavy slippages quarter after quarter, the State Bank of India (SBI) expects that fewer loans will turn sour going forward. The country’s largest lender aims to contain its slippage ratio within 2 percent of its loan book by end of the current financial year, Chairman Rajnish Kumar said. The bank’s loan book stood at Rs 22.48 lakh crore on September 30.

More slippages from watch list likely, says Axis Bank CEO Amitabh Chaudhry

Given the current economic scenario, Axis Bank is likely to witness higher slippages from its pool of stressed assets going forward, the bank’s MD & CEO Amitabh Chaudhry said. Slowing economy, funding issues faced by non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies, promoters facing legal issues and others under the lens of enforcement agencies are the several challenges that may have a bearing on the banking sector.

Economic slowdown likely to push up credit costs, says Uday Kotak

The slowing economy and a delayed turnaround are likely to push up credit costs for the private sector lender going forward, Uday Kotak, MD, Kotak Mahindra Bank said. “We do believe that the credit costs are going to be a little higher than what we had bargained for at the beginning of the year,” Kotak said in an earnings call, adding that the bank expected the credit costs to be around 60 basis points.

SBI’s domestic net interest margins also improved to 3.22 percent in the second quarter, from 2.80 percent in the same period last year.

The bank is adequately capitalized as of now and may go ahead with the plan of listing its credit card venture. It has, however, shelved the plan to list its general insurance arm this financial year, for the want of better valuations."

With the festive season here and Diwali gifts on the horizon, public sector banks State Bank of India (SBI) and Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) are considering gifts to staff worth Rs 1,000 crore, Mint reported quoting IANS sources.

The outgoing costs for SBI’s 257,000 employees would be Rs 25.7 crore.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

The gift packages will consist of sweets, dry fruits, and chocolates as these PSBs’ competent authorities have issued directions against monetary gifts. This is the first time OBC staff will receive Diwali gifts.

The expenditure for the same at SBI will be debited from the respective offices and then refunded from the Staff Welfare Fund 2019-20, when allocated.

Swarup Kumar Saha, General Manager – Human Resource Development at OBC, mentioned the improved financial performance during Q2FY19-20 in a circular to branches and offices. The circular added that Diwali expense would be funded from Charges General (Staff Welfare).

The bank posted a net profit of Rs 126 crore, a 23.53 percent growth from the previous year. It also logged a 20.99 percent jump in profits at Rs 1,176 crore.

However, there are questions being raised on state-run banks giving gifts only during Diwali while they have employees of various faiths.

A DMK spokesperson and Member of Parliament TKS Elangovan told IANS: ""These banks are owned by the government of India where people of different religions work. The employees should be given the option of choosing the festival for which he would accept the gift."""

India's largest lender State Bank of India's September quarter profit may get impacted by one-off deferred tax assets (DTA) adjustment, but the net interest income and loan growth could be more than 10 percent compared to year-ago, according to brokerages.

The stock fell more than 11 percent year-to-date (Y2D), underperforming benchmark index Nifty50 (up nearly 7 percent) and Nifty Bank (up 8 percent). It corrected 27 percent since the start of July amid asset quality concerns.

The profit in Q2 is likely to grow in the range of 60-95 percent year-on-year (YoY) on lower provisions and gains from stake sale in SBI Life Insurance, but may get impacted by DTA adjustment.

""Sale of shares in SBI Life has led to Rs 3,000 crore of gains which will mitigate DTA markdown impact which we assume will be spread over three quarters,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher which expected net interest income to increase 12 percent and pre-provision operating profit to rise 24 percent YoY.

Motilal Oswal, which has buy call on the stock, expects the loan growth of 13 percent YoY, led by growth in retail book and deposit growth at 8 percent YoY. NII is expected to increase by 12 percent YoY due to lower interest reversals and stable margins, according to the brokerage.

Asset quality is the key thing to watch out for during the quarter as most analysts expect slippages to fall to around Rs 11,000-12,000 crore from Rs 16,995 crore seen in June quarter. Non-performing assets could also see some improvement sequentially due to recovery from NPAs or write-offs.

""Stress addition is likely to come in at 2.2 percent levels, as we believe that most of the stress has been recorded in previous quarters. Developments on the IBC-related accounts and resolution of power assets remain a key monitorable,"" said Motilal Oswal which expected gross NPA at 7 percent (against 7.5 percent QoQ) and net NPAs at 2.8 percent (against 3.1 percent QoQ).

The market will also closely watch commentary on telecom exposure as the Supreme Court has rejected the telecom companies' definition of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR). The bank has exposure of around Rs 40,000-50,000 crore to telecom space.

Other key issues to watch out for would be updates on the retail, SME and agri slippages, recoveries from the resolution of NCLT accounts, and outlook on power assets and macro developments on asset quality."
"October 24, 2019 11:52 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-chairman-sees-indian-economy-in-transition-phase-growth-to-come-back-4570211.html,"The Indian economy is in a transition phase largely owing to important reforms undertaken in the last few years, a top Indian banker has said exuding confidence that the country's growth rate will be back on track.

""Growth can come back. Because of a lot of (reforms), economy is in transition. We had GST (goods and services tax). We had IBC (insolvency and bankruptcy code). All these reforms have been implemented in last three years. And as a result, we are in a transition period. A lot of cleanup has happened in the corporate sector,” SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar told PTI in an interview.

Kumar, 61, was in Washington last week as part of the Indian delegation led by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to attend the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

""When there is transition, I think, some disruption always happens,"" he said.

Kumar further said in terms of development, India is still not in the ""developed"" category. Besides, the per capita income is still low. There is huge scope for growth in India, and demographics is also not against India.

Unlike many other developed countries where they are facing challenges on account of demographics, India does not have that kind of challenge at least for the time being, he said.

""And that is where the growth can come back,"" the top Indian banker said.

“So, in my view we are seeing the bottom as far as economic growth is concerned. Now it will go up... because sector by sector, if we look at agriculture I'm finding this year position is better even in terms of credit, manufacturing is slow and private sector investment in infrastructure is slow,” he said.

Observing that the Modi government over the past few years has brought banking to the doorsteps of every household, Kumar said the activation of these accounts have reached almost 90 per cent. Besides, balances of these accounts are now reaching a level where servicing these accounts is “not a loss-making proposition” for the banks, he noted.

""Average balance in these accounts is touching Rs 1,900, about Rs 230 billion in June was the balance in the savings bank account,” he said, adding that there is benefit to the economy when one is able to bring such a large population under the banking channels.

Noting that the biggest challenge in the banking sector was about the functioning of the public sector banks, Kumar said recapitalisation has happened in a big way but sectoral issues need to be addressed like the power, road and telecom sectors.

""These sectoral issues impact the working of the banks, particularly on the asset quality front,"" he said.

He further said that in this government there is no political interference in the banking sector. ""State Bank of India has been more immune to any pressures because the systems are such that it is very difficult for any Chairman, any MD to influence any decision-making process,” he said.

When asked about cryptocurrency, which has been banned in India, the SBI chairman said the way the world is moving towards digitisation, at some stage, a regulated cryptocurrency would be a better bet than an unregulated one.

“Let's see. Because there's a dark side of the internet also. There can be misuse of the digital currencies. That is why regulation is must,” he said adding that efforts are on how to bring technologies like blockchain into functioning of the banks."

Shares of State Bank of India gained 1.7 percent after Motilal Oswal remains bullish on the stock, expecting a massive 32 percent return despite uncertain macros.

The stock has corrected 29 percent over the past three months, which provides favourable risk-reward, the brokerage said. It conservatively expects return on asset (RoA)/return on equity (RoE) to improve to 0.7 percent/12.7 percent by FY21, respectively, and maintained its buy rating as well as target price at Rs 350 per share.

It was quoting at Rs 268.55, up Rs 3.10, or 1.17 percent on the BSE at 1348 hours IST.

The country's largest lender's earnings were suppressed for the past several years due to issues pertaining to asset quality, merger and an adverse rate environment.

""Even now, the macro environment remains challenging with high rating downgrades in the system, resulting in new names being added to the stressed pool. However, given SBI's size, we believe the new stress is manageable (around two percent of total loans),"" Motilal Oswal said.

The brokerage feels SBI is well poised for an earnings recovery led by steady operating performance at the pre-provisioning operating profit (PPOP) level (14 percent CAGR over FY19-21), recoveries from large NCLT resolutions and normalisation in credit cost to 1.9 percent/1.3 percent over FY20/FY21, respectively, against an average of three percent over FY16-19.

SBI's subsidiaries – SBI MF, SBI Life Insurance, SBI Cards and SBI Cap Securities -- have displayed robust performance in the last few years.

SBI plans to monetise several of its subsidiaries, which would lead to further value unlocking for stakeholders, Motilal Oswal said, adding at the current market price, SBI's subsidiaries accounting for around 35 percent of its total valuation. ""The bank is trading close to its lowest valuation (0.7 times FY21 estimated asset book value) -- at least for the past five years (including asset quality review period),"" it added.

I would suggest investors have limited exposure to the banking sector and invest only in banks with a better track record like SBI, ICICI, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank, Romesh Tiwari Head of Research CapitalAim, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

edited excerpts:



Q) Indian market rose over 1 percent in the week gone by, do you think we are out of the woods? What should be the trading strategy of investors for the rest of the October series and what important levels should one track?

A) The lurking uncertainty of the revival of domestic demand is fuelling the volatility witnessed this week. Major steps taken by the Finance Ministry will certainly help the profitability of companies but the revival of demand is still unaddressed.

October will be crucial to understand consumer sentiments and the future measures required to boost trading activities.

For the rest of the month, the Nifty can trade in the range of 11,000 on the downside, and 11,700 on the upside in absence of any major news flow from the domestic or global front.

Trade war worries and data from the US economy is also affecting FPI trading activities in the Indian markets.

In October till date, the net investment from FPI is still negative after a negative September. Investors should not buy aggressively at these levels and consider hedging their long positions with put options.

Q) Do you think any adverse decision regarding the trade war, over the weekend, could put bulls on the backfoot? We have seen plenty of volatility in the week gone by already due to trade war rhetoric?

A) Trade war news is surely affecting the sentiments of the traders but the fear of recession is also a major reason that is contributing to the rise in volatility.

The market is keenly watching the numbers coming out from the domestic economy, as well as, from the movers and shakers of the global economy.

Any adverse decision on trade war can easily pull the markets down and can push the Nifty below 11,000 in a quick time. The market is expected to remain volatile due to news flows this week.

Q) Plenty of stocks have slipped from their 52-week highs in the S&P BSE 500 index since September 20 (breakout). What should be the selection criteria of investors in picking stocks?

A) Buying into stocks that recently slipped from their highs may be a good strategy for momentum traders but is not advisable for investors.

Investors should always look for stocks that offer good value and growth prospects for the price and that requires systematic research, patience, and financial discipline.

There is no fixed or iron-clad secret formula for picking stocks as the markets are by nature ""unpredictable"". Investors should always look closely at promoters and insiders' actions (buying, selling or pledging of shares) and motives for the same as they have a far better knowledge about how their company is performing at the moment.

Q) What are your views on Infosys and TCS – which one is a better bet or investors should move funds to midcap IT?

A) I am positive on the IT sector in the current scenario and expect both Infosys and TCS to give good annual returns in the next couple of years.

Though the recently declared result of TCS was a bit subdued while Infosys result met market expectations. I think investors should buy into both on dips for better portfolio returns.

IT majors like Infosys and TCS are robust and can provide a comparatively secured return, while returns on midcap IT will be more volatile, so investors should choose according to their risk appetite.

Q) Banking stocks are back in bear's grip due to the news flow and asset quality woes. What are your view and how should investors approach this sector now?

A) The credibility of the banking sector is badly hit by the revelations of fraud at the topmost level of management. It will not be easy for the sector to gain the investors' trust again and certainly not in the near future.

How can an investor value stock with the aid of data that can be entirely tempered and fictitious? I am not implying that all the banks are untrustworthy but the risk is far greater than the expected returns.

I would suggest investors have very limited exposure to the sector and invest only in banks with a better track record like SBI, ICICI, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank.

State Bank of India (SBI) is bringing back processing fees on home loans, top-up plans and corporate and builder loans, as per a Times of India report.

In an internal circular, SBI informed that the full waiver of the consolidated processing fee, which was to last through the festive period till December, has been withdrawn.

""The waiver will continue for proposals sourced up to October 15,"" the circular read.

The processing fee would be close to 0.4 percent, which on an average for individual borrowers would work out anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 30,000. For builders, a flat Rs 5,000 charge has been levied, a source told the paper.

The move comes on the back of significant downtrend in interest income after the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut the repo rate by 25 bps on October 4, the source added.

India’s largest public lender had on July 1 launched an automatic software pegging home loans to the dynamic moving rate. This was rolled back on August 1. On October 1, it rolled out another software which pegged loans to the RBI’s benchmark rate.

Other charges such as prepayment charges and Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest registration fee may also be increased later."

State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, has issued details about the interest rate structure for its new repo-rate linked home loan schemes. The list of interest rates for floating rate home loan products will come into effect starting next month (October).

This is in line with the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) mandate for banks to link all new floating rate loan products (home, auto, retail) to external benchmarks with effect from October 1, 2019.

The bank has fixed its lending rate based on the external benchmark-linked rate (EBR) at 8.05 percent. This implies a spread of 2.65 percent being charged over the RBI's repo rate (currently 5.4 percent).

For salaried class customers applying for home loans upto Rs 30 lakh, the bank will charge a premium of 15 basis points (bps) above the EBR. This means an effective rate (ER) of 8.20 percent on such loan products.

Home loans between Rs 30 lakh to Rs 75 lakh would come at an ER of 8.45 percent, i.e. EBR plus a premium of 40 bps.

Salaried customers applying for home loans above Rs 75 lakh would have to pay interest at the rate of 8.55 percent. This includes a premium of 50 bps above the EBR.

SBI has additionally specified that a premium of 15 bps will be added to home loan card rates for non-salaried customers, while a concession of 5 bps will be available to women borrowers.

For home loans up to Rs 30 lakh, where the loan to value (LTV) ratio is above 80 percent but less than or equal to 90 percent, a premium of 10 bps will be added. Loan to value ratio is the proportion of the property value that a lender can finance through a loan.

Meanwhile, home loans for customers who come under risk grade (4to 6) will attract an additional 10 bps premium."

The bank said it will link its retail and SME loans to Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) repo rate as external benchmark. The lender has also voluntarily extended the benchmark to micro and small enterprises from October 1.

As per RBI norms, banks have to link their retail and SME loans to an external benchmark starting next month. Other than the repo rate, other options include the three-month or six-month treasury bill yield published by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt (FBIL).

In May, SBI had introduced these products voluntarily but withdrew them from the market after RBI issued a circular making it mandatory for all banks to follow suit.

SBI said it has modified its home, auto and SME floating rate products to comply with regulatory norms. The changes will be released on its website soon, SBI said."

Real estate financier Altico Capital, which recently defaulted on debt repayments, has sought time from lenders to work out a resolution plan to meet its financial commitments.

The non-banking finance company (NBFC) has held a series of meetings with its creditors to reach a resolution plan, Altico said in a statement.

“It is important that stakeholders give Altico and its advisors time to craft a plan that may maximize asset value, refrain from actions that exacerbate the liquidity problem and bear in mind the significant headwinds the real estate sector faces in India at the present time,” Altico said.

The company added that many of its lenders had recalled a substantial amount of debt after it received one-notch rating downgrade earlier in September. Altico said that it did not have sufficient liquidity to honour all its obligations on a timely basis.

“This lack of capacity led Altico to pause further debt repayments in order to maintain itself as a going concern and to protect the interests of all stakeholders,” the NBFC said.

Altico Capital has Rs 4,361.5 crore of principal outstanding on loans from 27 lenders including the State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank, Yes Bank and IFCI.

In a meeting with lenders last week, the NBFC sought moratorium on loans citing challenges being faced by the company and the real estate sector.

Over the past month, top officials have resigned from the company, leaving a hole in the senior leadership. After losing its chairperson Naina Lal Kidwai, the company reported resignation of its CEO Sanjay Grewal on September 18.

Altico said it is now being led by COO Sanjeev Agarwal.

“The company has as well appointed financial and legal advisors to support discussions with creditors, each of which are industry-leading and will help guide the situation to the best possible outcome,” the NBFC said, adding that Altico is committed to maintaining an open and active dialogue with all stakeholders, including regulatory authorities."

The country's second-largest credit card provider, SBI Cards & Payments Services, a subsidiary of State Bank of India, has shortlisted Axis Capital, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC, Nomura, Kotak Mahindra Capital and SBI Caps as merchant bankers for its mega initial public offer (IPO) to raise at least $1 billion, sources with knowledge of the matter told Moneycontrol.

If the Gurgaon headquartered firm's plans fructify, it will be the first domestic listing by a pure-play credit card company.

Sources added that the process is likely to kick off this week and the management plans to hit the markets before March 2020.

State Bank of India holds 74% stake in the company while private equity giant Carlyle holds the remaining 26%. The issue is likely to be a combination of primary and secondary issue of shares, with a partial exit by both SBI & Carlyle.

""The company intends to tap capital markets via IPO through Offer for Sale by dilution of up to 14% of the issued and paid-up capital i.e. up to 13,05,26,798 equity shares and primary issuance of up to Rs. 1,000 crores,"" SBI Cards had said in a request for proposal (RFP) inviting bids from merchant banks and law firms.

According to a recent PTI report, the SBI Cards MD & CEO Hardayal Prasad had said credit business had huge potential to grow in view of the very low penetration in the country. He said there were only three credit cards for a population of 100, compared to 165 in Singapore and 250 in Hong Kong.

According to the RBI, as of March 2019, SBI Cards was ranked 2nd behind leader HDFC Bank with the credit card base and credit card spends capturing 17.6% and 17.1% market share in the respective categories.

Besides the corporate office & registered office, it has 14 branches across the country.

SBI Cards had a credit card base of about 8.27 million as of March 2019, clocking a growth of 32.2% on March 2018's base of 6.26 million. Annual spends on its credit cards (excluding cross-sell) stood at Rs 1,03,170 crore, an increase of 34.9% year-on-year.

The company has products catering to multiple segments ranging from Simply Save credit card for the masses, SimplyClick for the online savvy, Elite & Prime products for the affluent, and Doctors Card for medical practitioners.

It has co-branded cards in segments like travel (Etihad, IRCTC, Air-India), e-commerce (Yatra, OLA), lifestyle (Central, Tata & FBB), healthcare (Apollo), fuel (Bharat Petroleum), metro (Chennai, Mumbai) and banking partnerships (Oriental Bank of Commerce, Bank of Maharashtra, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Federal Bank, South Indian Bank, Karnataka Bank, Allahabad Bank & Karur Vysya Bank).

Former State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya is looking to start a general insurance business, along with Sunil Mehta, former country head and chief executive of American insurer AIG, and Deepak Ishwarbhai Amin, a former director of SBI, a person aware of the development said on condition of anonymity.

On September 3, Bhattacharya and Mehta registered their company, Welmo Fintech Pvt. Ltd. The insurer has a paid-up share capital of Rs 1 lakh, according to data from the ministry of corporate affairs.

“They will soon be approaching the insurance regulator to obtain an R1 approval,” the person said. R1 is the first stage of approval by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) to start an insurance company. It is followed by R2 and R3 approvals.

Welmo will, however, be required to have a minimum of Rs 100 crore as paid-up equity share capital to obtain the second stage of regulatory approval.

“They are looking to raise capital from venture capital investors,” said the person cited earlier.

While Bhattacharya declined to comment, emailed queries sent to Mehta and Amin remained unanswered.

After stepping down as SBI chairperson in 2017, Bhattacharya had stints as directors of seven Indian companies, including Ajay Piramal-led Piramal Enterprises Ltd and Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. She is an additional independent director at rating agency Crisil Ltd and an adviser to homegrown private equity firm ChrysCapital Advisors Llp.

Recently, Irdai granted licences to a host of general insurers, mostly promoted by insurance veterans. In 2017, four companies—Go Digit General Insurance Ltd, Acko General Insurance Ltd, DHFL General Insurance Ltd and Edelweiss General Insurance Co. Ltd—secured regulatory approvals.

Former Bajaj Allianz chief executive officer Kamesh Goyal’s Go Digit General Insurance is backed by Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa’s Fairfax Financial Holdings. Acko General Insurance, started by Varun Dua, the founder of online insurance broking firm Coverfox, has also received its licence from Irdai.

In April, Irdai gave preliminary approval to Indiabulls General Insurance Ltd, a subsidiary of Indiabulls Integrated Services Ltd.

As of March last year, 68 insurers were operating in India, including 24 life insurers, 27 general insurers and six health insurers. As of 2017, general insurance penetration in India was a meagre 0.93 percent, compared to 2.76 percent for life insurance, according to Irdai.

The penetration of general insurance, measured as the ratio of premium (in US dollars) to gross domestic product (in US dollars) stood at 2.8 percent globally in 2017, more than three times that of India—a clear indication that the country has a vast growth potential considering its large population."
"September 17, 2019 08:06 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/sbi-wants-to-bring-back-teaser-loans-but-will-it-get-rbi-nod-4443921.html,"The country’s largest lender is making another attempt at bringing back the so called 'teaser loans' as the banking industry gears up to meet the deadline for linking loans to an external benchmark.

State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar said the lender will be seeking clarifications from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to see if it can offer home loans with fixed rates in the beginning and convert the same into floating rates later.

This is not the first time that SBI is trying to bring such a product into the market. Its earlier attempts were thwarted by the regulator, which had a different take on these hybrid loans.

What are teaser loans?Home loans that carry low fixed interest rates for the initial few years and switch to a floating rate framework after a specified period of time are unofficially referred to as teaser loans. However, bankers dread the term and prefer to call them fixed-cum-floating rate loans. Every time interest rates trend low, there are talks of re-introducing the product.

In India, such loans were first launched by SBI in 2009 to boost credit growth and boost the housing construction industry. SBI was offering home loans at fixed rates as low as eight percent for the first year, and nine percent for the second and third years. After that the loan would shift to then prevailing market rates under a floating rate mechanism. A number of lenders followed suit. However, due to much scorn from RBI, these loans were discontinued after a short period.

Why was RBI unhappy with teaser loans?These loans were called teaser loans for a reason. Banks first use low interest rates to lure or tease the customers into taking loans and then move to higher market rates later. This jump can deliver a nasty shock to borrowers when their EMIs suddenly shoot up.

In fact, RBI mandated banks offering teaser loans to make higher provisioning against such loans. “This practice raises concern as some borrowers may find it difficult to service the loans once the normal interest rate, which is higher than the rate applicable in the initial years, becomes effective,” RBI said in a circular in December 2010. “It has been observed that many banks at the time of the initial loan appraisal do not take into account the repaying capacity of the borrower at normal lending rates,” it added.

So, why is SBI keen on bringing them back?From October 1, banks have been mandated to link their retail and SME loans to an external benchmark to ensure that banks are able to offer lower lending rates. The existing mechanism of linking rates to Marginal Cost-based Lending Rates (MCLR) has proved ineffective in doing so.

Now, the issue with external benchmarking is that while a fixed rate loan portfolio ensures returns in future, shifting to a floating rate structure will create uncertainties. Also, a fully fixed rate long-term loan isn’t desirable either as rates are on the downtrend.

On the liability side, Indian customers are not used to flexible deposit rates. Also, the interest rate derivative market in the country is not deep enough to help safeguard banks from future fluctuations in the benchmark rate. Bankers say it will be difficult to avoid an asset-liability mismatch in such a scenario.

Will SBI succeed this time?A senior banker referred to teaser loans as an 'illusion' that benefits temporarily at first but causes discomfort when reality strikes in a matter of time.

“There are not many chances that RBI will approve it. Once or twice it has taken views against it, but with a change in guard, there may be a different view, especially if the regulator is only worried about the present,” the official said.

The floating rate structure under external benchmarking also poses similar risks to the borrower. They will be exposed to the volatility in RBI's repo rate, which most banks have opted as an external benchmark. It remains to be seen what the regulator has to say on the return of teaser loans."

Lenders to realty financier Altico Capital, which defaulted on an interest payment last week, will soon meet to consider a debt restructuring plan. Debt of the non-banking finance company’s (NBFC) stands at Rs 4,361.55 crore.

On September 12, Altico defaulted on Rs 19.97 crore of interest payment on an External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) of Rs 340 crore from UAE-based Mashreq Bank. The default triggered a rating downgrade by credit rating agencies.

As per regulatory norms, lenders are required to sign an Inter-Creditor Agreement (ICA) and decide upon a final resolution plan for the stressed account within 30 days of the first default. The consortium then has a time- frame of 180 days to implement the resolution plan.

State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar said a 'selfish' action by a leading private sector bank to secure its own exposure could have a negative impact on the rest of the system. Other lenders include HDFC Bank, Union Bank of India and Au Small Finance Bank.

“As per the management, Altico faced pressure of accelerated debt repayment from some lenders and also experienced difficulty in mobilising fresh funds. While the existing cash balance was sufficient to meet the present obligation, the company defaulted on this,” India Ratings said in its latest report.

“Given the recent developments, Ind-Ra opines that it may be difficult for Altico to service its debt obligations in a timely manner from hereon,” it added. India Ratings has downgraded the company’s long-term debt rating to junk status.

The 15-year old NBFC is backed by Clearwater Capital Partners, Abu Dhabi Investment Council and Varde Partners.

On September 13, UTI Mutual Fund issued a note stating creation of a segregated portfolio in UTI Credit Risk Fund for the NBFC. “UTI AMC will pursue all possible options to protect the interest of its shareholders including segregation of the concerned portfolio."" This means that whatever is recovered will be distributed to investors in proportion to their holding as in the main portfolio.

“Given, the low gearing ratio of the company, even in a stressed asset sale scenario, there is sufficient cushion to clear dues for the lenders,” the note stated.

The NBFC sector, earlier rocked by repayment failures of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) and IL&FS, is expected to face more challenges going forward. These include lower credit growth, higher pressure on margins and lesser fund raising avenues going forward."
"September 15, 2019 05:20 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sbi-to-move-rbi-to-offer-fixed-floating-rate-home-loans-chairman-rajnish-kumar-4437781.html,"The largest lender State Bank of India will be seeking clarifications from the Reserve Bank whether it can offer long-term home loans with fixed rates in the beginning and convert the same into floating rates later, chairman Rajnish Kumar has said.

The move comes after the Reserve Bank has mandated banks to shift all retail lending to floating rates that will be determined by external benchmarks like the repo rate.

Kumar said there is a lack of clarity on how it can go ahead with the fixed rate products, after the RBI's new regulations on floating rates.

Hinting at the volatility in the repo rate, he said some home buyers may want their loan rates to be fixed.

For such buyers, it can offer a 'fixed-floating' product, wherein the rates are locked in for an initial period of say five to ten years, and then turns floating.

The need for making the product floating in the latter part arises out of the bank's inability to project the liability movements in the future, he said, adding typically, home loans are for about 30 years.

It can be noted that the repo rate at which the central bank lends to the system is at a nine-year low of 5.40 percent.

Speaking to reporters here over the weekend, Kumar said the central bank's recent guidelines on floating rate products for the retail segment has necessitated the need for the clarity.

Kumar has clarified that from an asset liability management perspective, it is difficult to have a fixed rate product for a long term like 30 years, the maximum tenor of a home loan now from the bank now. Some private sector peers offer up to 35 years of home loans depending on in the age of the borrower, though.

At present, SBI has a floating rate home loan product linked to its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate and it recently withdrew one linked to the repo rate. It does not have a fixed rate home loan product at present.

As of now, under the marginal cost of funds based lending, floating rate loans are re-set as when the interest rates fall or rise, but fixed rate loans are reset in 9-12 months. But when the loans are linked to the repo rate, the rates can change sharply, depending on how RBI acts on the rate front.

Many mortgage borrowers normally choose fixed rates, as that helps them better manage their finances because of the certainty about the EMI outgoes.

Kumar said the bank does not have adequate liabilities linked to the floating rate which makes such a floating product difficult.

Speaking on the RBI-mandated systemic shift to external benchmarked lending rates, he said SBI will have minimal issues with the same.

He said the industry leader was the first to move on to the repo-linked loans and deposits since May, and has many of its products aligned to the external benchmarks now.

However, he said such shifts make asset liability management ""challenging"" as there lack of floating rate liabilities now.

About the impact of the mega bank mergers on SBI, he said it will not impact the nation's largest bank as SBI has specified business model and target segments, and will continue with the same."

Investor interest for its cards business is very high, and SBI Card listing will happen in the March quarter, he said.

The bank was earlier looking for an IPO for SBI General Insurance in FY21.

When asked if the IPO for general insurance will happen next fiscal, Kumar replied in the negative, saying there is no need for capital.

SBI General, valued at over Rs 12,000 crore recently, is a joint venture between SBI and Insurance Australia Group with a 26 percent ownership.

On the additional stake sale in SBI Life, Kumar explained that the bank is required to offload an additional 2 percent stake as per the SEBI norms, but has time till October 2020 to execute the same.

About the SBI Card IPO, he said the feelers from investors suggest that they are excited to invest in the company.

The IPO will be launched in the January-March quarter of the current fiscal and based on the valuation arrived at, SBI will take a call on the stake sale, he said.

SBI owns 74 percent in the cards venture, while its foreign partner can also choose to dilute its stake through the IPO (initial public offering), Kumar said."

SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar on September 14 inaugurated a new branch in this remote town of Diskit in the Nubra Valley, making it the 14th facility of the bank in the Ladakh region and 22,024th branch for the bank.

Every state or region has a lead-bank, which takes the mantle of ensuring adequate banking services as the convenor of the state-level banking committee.

At present, J&K Bank is the lead-bank for Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.

On August 5, the government had announced that the entire region will cease to be a single state but would become two Union territories of J&K and Ladakh, wherein J&K will have a state Assembly under lieutenant governor, while Ladakh will have no legislature.

The announcement was part of the government decision to abrogate Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution which gave special status to J&K.

Speaking to reporters here Saturday, the chairman said if other banks have a problem to be the SLBC convenor, SBI is willing to take up that mantle.

He said the branch in Diskit was planned over three months ago, much before the Centre decided to bifurcate the state into two UTs.

Kumar also affirmed SBIs commitment to help the people of both the UTs with credit needs once the demand comes.

The bank has 185 branches in Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, and personal lending segment is the most active, he said.

There is also traction on the small business front, but lending to agriculture and industry is limited in J&K, he admitted, adding that the average loan in this area is also small, at up to Rs 5 lakh.

""Through such initiatives, we want the people of the region to know how deep do we take our banking services into the remotest parts of the country,"" Kumar said.

Diskit is located at an altitude of over 10,000 ft, and is around 90-km off the border with Pakistan at Turtuk.

Local member of Parliament Jamyang Tsering Namgyal welcomed the SBI move to open two more branches in remote villages, including Batalik, which had seen action during the Kargil conflict in 1999.

He expressed hope that these branches will channelise savings of the people and help them access credit, which will lead to the overall growth of the region."

"September 11, 2019 08:40 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/how-digital-transformation-has-become-important-in-bfsi-sector-4427011.html,"The existence of an app to manage just about any financial operation today has led to an explosion of data. To cope with a rapid growth in information Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) companies have been compelled to embrace a data-centric philosophy as part of their digital transformation journey.

However, while embarking on this journey, companies should have a clear understanding of what they are trying to achieve or solve. This is what Bhavesh Lakhani, Senior Vice President and Head-IT, SBI Mutual Funds told Prakash Mallya, Vice President and Managing Director, Sales & Marketing Group of Intel India at the Intel Data-Centric Innovation Summit recently.

Though SBI started its digital transformation journey three years ago intending to become the most preferred mutual fund company in India and overseas, physical forms continue to contribute over 80 percent of its revenues. However, digitisation has helped it significantly when it comes to solving distribution challenges.

""We have APIs available. So, if someone wants to start a distribution business in their community, we offer the platform freely,"" Lakhani said.

He added that the key to ensuring successful digitisation within the organisation was to adopt digital practises in-house, in addition to rolling it out to consumers. For instance, it moved from paper-based approvals to document management systems and even shifted its HR platform to the cloud.

“We were also the first mutual fund company to adopt Microsoft’s Office 365 and worked with Google and Alexa where customers could talk to these platforms for their basic queries. Soon, they were bypassing the call center and were instead accessing these virtual assistants to get basic information related to KYC and documentation,” Lakhani claimed.

This has prompted the country’s third-largest mutual fund company to continue deploying purpose-driven solutions that are likely to have a positive impact on topline and bottom-line while adhering to regulatory norms.

BUSINESS DRIVES DIGITAL OUTCOME

Interestingly, in India, when opting for data-driven digital business models, most organisations first consider the project cost, while its benefits are often an afterthought. This becomes more prominent in a highly regulated domain like BFSI.

Mallya pointed out that though many BFSI companies have adopted digital strategies, only 2 percent of the humongous and continual data coming through various funnels are analyzed.

How can these companies leverage digital transformation to deal with this challenge?

Bhavesh explained that technology has evolved when it comes to computing and storage and has become cheaper and easier to manage. However, a lot of improvement needs to be done for network and connectivity.""Once 5G is here, the value of the data generated in real-time will be immense,"" he added.

At the same time, one should be prepared for the eventuality of infrastructure failure. That is where Artificial intelligence(AI) and Machine learning (ML)-based monitoring tools can help in spotting fissures in the network.

Systems that can predict and detect these anomalies are becoming more critical for business operations that need to be up 24x7, which is where BFSI companies should focus their tech investments.

ANALYSIS PARALYSIS

Procuring data has become easier and cheaper but harvesting massive amounts of information is quite challenging. This is compounded by issues like data ambiguity, which include incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate information. So, companies must evaluate the time spent on data gathering to fully understand its utility as per their business objectives.

""There is a clichéd term called ‘analysis paralysis’ and what are you going to do with that much data. It is important to first map out the key data points that you want to analyze and what challenges it will solve,"" Lakhani advised.

One also needs to remember that all data sources have a lifespan and fidelity associated with it. So, it needs to be refreshed as per the business requirements to ensure that the right information is gathered, filtered and available for use."

Public sector lenders State Bank of India (SBI) and Bank of Baroda (BoB) are looking outside their ranks to hire nearly 500 people for specialist roles, ranging from information technology to managing the small business segment.

While SBI will hire 477 candidates for information technology roles, Bank of Baroda will hire 15 sector specialists to market its MSME products, two separate newspaper advertisements on Tuesday showed.

According to the SBI, the proposed lateral hires are in the grades of assistant manager, deputy manager, manager and chief manager. These include developer, database administrator, cloud administrator, infrastructure engineer, IT security expert, cyber security - threat hunting and cyber security - and digital forensic, among others.

Of the 477 vacancies in SBI, 248 are for candidates belonging to the general category, while the rest are reserved. The highest number of vacancies is for developers (181), followed by IT security expert (94) and 47 system or server administrator. At present, SBI hires a mix of probationary officers, junior associates, lateral hires and management trainees.

According to the bank’s website, lateral hires typically include chartered accountants, analysts, statisticians, risk raters, economists, lawyers, engineers and system engineers.

Meanwhile, Bank of Baroda said in its notice that it is looking to support small businesses under the Uttar Pradesh government’s One District One Product scheme, and will create separate verticals for products. The scheme is an initiative of the UP government to promote micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME)-based manufacturing through organized support in the areas of finance, marketing, production, policy and technology.

“The bank is creating separate verticals for some of the key products under the scheme and to support this key initiative for furthering the growth of the MSME sector,"" it said, adding that it was looking for 15 experienced sector specialists to market its MSME products.

Lateral hiring is the process of recruiting an expert for a specific role from another organization.

Last month, while announcing the merger of 10 public sector banks (PSBs) into four, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the banks will also recruit a chief risk officer at market-linked compensation to attract talent.

Employees hired laterally are typically remunerated at aprevailing market rates, higher than that in public sector banks. Mint reported on 26 August that the gap between the remuneration of chief executives of state-run banks and their private counterparts has widened in the last two years. The average daily remuneration of a public sector bank chief was Rs 8,541 in FY19, while a private bank chief executive officer (CEO) earned Rs 2.48 lakh per day in the same period.

A major component of the remuneration in private banks is through stock options for senior executives. Public sector banks have also been toying with the idea of employee stock option schemes to bring in a performance-linked incentive structure.

The idea was mooted by the Banks Board Bureau (BBB), a government body tasked with looking into the performance of public sector banks. It also received the finance ministry’s nod in March 2017 and some banks such as Allahabad Bank, United Bank of India and Union Bank of India are implementing this scheme."

The Indian market is down by about 9 percent from its record high, which has laid down the groundwork along with other domestic and global factors for a short term rally in high beta stocks.

The conditions for sustained outperformance of high beta and interest rate sensitive stocks are not developing structurally due to the weak private investment cycle. But, the impact of dovish FED, rise in global liquidity, surplus banking liquidity, stimulus announcements, and valuations could result in a short cycle (3-5 months) beta rally, ICICI Securities said in a report.

The report further added that the best high beta and interest rate sensitive stocks to play the rally from the coverage universe include stocks like SBI, Axis Bank, BPCL, NTPC, Power Grid, L&T, and Ultratech Cement.

Over the past one week, NIFTY50 fell marginally (-0.2 percent), underperforming against developed markets (DMs) and Emerging Markets (EMs), while mid-and-smallcaps fared better, up 0.9 percent and 0.6 percent respectively in the same period.

Realty, PSU Banks, FMCG, and Consumers Durables led the fall while Metals, Infra, Auto and Power were up during the past week.

The valuations, too, turned favourable. Bond-Earnings yields spread is at 66bps (much below long-term averages or LTA). The market cap to GDP ratio is at 73 percent which is still lower than the LTA of 78 percent.

ICICI Securities highlights 6 factors which could lead to a beta rally in the near future (two-three months)

Impact of dovish FED on EM flows and currencies

The US FED bought treasuries worth US$14 billion over the past fortnight and is the first such instance of QE since it began its balance sheet reduction program in November 2017.

The dovish signal on rates and liquidity by the US FED and other central banks including India and China could result in a halt to the sharp portfolio outflows from EMs including India and halt the sharp depreciation in EM currencies.

Rising global liquidity will find its way to relatively high real yields for India

Trailing 30 days FPI flows (bonds+equities) have turned positive for India at ~US$300 million, which is also positively impacting the INR.

India real bond yield at 3.4 percent is amongst the highest within EMs and a stable INR could continue to attract foreign capital.

Surplus banking liquidity to surge further

The surplus liquidity in the banking system has consistently stayed above the Rs 1 trillion mark since July and could surge further based on the positive trends in the key drivers of liquidity.

The continued surplus liquidity will also result in excess bank reserves thereby boosting the money multiplier which dipped in FY19 to 5.6 from 5.8 in FY18.

Oil prices continue to be weak

Weakening oil prices thereby support the CAD or the current account deficit outlook while above average monsoon (3 percent surplus as of September 9) to support rural demand.

Government action on policy front

Pro-growth policy announcements and the room to spend after the RBI’s transfer of Rs 1.76 trillion to the government will keep optimism high.

Micro Triggers

The August PMI is soft but is still expanding MoM while the business optimism remains high. The weak growth narrative will continue but may not spring any negative surprise in the short term.

"September 09, 2019 08:49 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rbis-new-loan-pricing-norm-may-put-banks-in-a-fix-4418511.html,"The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) mandate that requires banks to link loans to an external benchmark, could increase the risk of asset-liability mismatch (ALM) in absence of a liquid derivatives market in the country.

From October 1, banks have been asked to link their retail and SME loans to an external benchmark for faster transmission of policy rates. These benchmarks include the RBI's repo rate, 3-month treasury bills yield, and 6-month treasury bills yield. Most banks have opted for the repo rate which is more predictable as compared to others.

Currently, banks use the Marginal Cost-based Lending Rate (MCLR) to price loans that are mostly fixed in nature. The MCLR is reviewed every month, but may or may not be revised as frequently. But if banks opt for RBI's repo rate as the benchmark, the lending rates on loans may change with the reduction/increase in the policy rate. The interest rate under the external benchmark will have to be reset at least once in three months, while the RBI reviews policy rates every two months.

This may lead to ALM risk in banks' books if they are unable to address the interest rate risk between floating-rate loans and fixed-rate deposits.

""All our liabilities are fixed-rate liabilities since floating rate deposits are not very popular. So, only the asset book will be priced on external benchmarks,"" said the head of treasury at a private bank.

A mismatch occurs when cash outflows exceed inflows. As per RBI guidelines, a mismatch should not exceed 20 percent of outflows in the time bucket of 1 to 28 days.

A stress test on liquidity risks that was carried out by the RBI, assumed two scenarios- a 50 percent and 100 percent increase in cash outflows in the 1-28 days time bucket. The results indicated that 25 banks under the first scenario and 36 banks under the second scenario may face liquidity stress, RBI said in its June Financial Stability Report.

Banks could turn to interest rate swaps for rescue. However, the swap market in India is largely one-sided. ""There is no price maker in that market even if banks are willing to access it,"" the treasury head said.

An interest rate swap is a contract between two parties that agree to exchange all future interest rate payments forthcoming from a bond or loan. This typically takes place between fixed and floating-rate loans. The aim is to offset the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the future.

In simple terms, both parties have to agree on what is likely to happen with interest rates in the future, based on what they know today. This leads to speculations as the market players will price in the regulator's future moves.

BP Kanungo, Deputy Governor, RBI recently pointed out the interest rate derivatives market in India continues to be lackluster. ""There is reasonable liquidity in overnight interest swaps (OIS), but there is no appetite, and hence not much trading in other derivatives including interest rate futures,"" he said. Also, the OIS is more of a trading instrument and may not be fit for hedging structural mismatches.

The risk also extends to housing finance companies (HFCs) since they borrow from the money market and will have to compete with banks in the home loan segment. ""In order to manage liquidity and interest rate risk, HDFC has, in the past, swapped fixed rate non-convertible debentures to MIBOR-linked payouts. We expect more such interest rate swaps,"" said MB Mahesh, analyst, Kotak Institutional Equities Research, adding that this will lead to an increase in swap costs and basis risks for HFCs.

Another banker said banks may look for a natural hedge in the current situation. For instance, every bank has a set of Current Accounts Savings Accounts (CASA), that remains constant for a few months as customers use only part of these for transaction purposes. This can be converted into term deposits.

""However, the problem is it cannot be done in isolation by any one bank and has to be enforced by the regulator. The best option we believe could be that regulator enforces all incremental bulk deposits henceforth to be repo linked /flexible,"" Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, State Bank of India said in a report. The RBI's circular, however, only applies to loans and not on deposits as of now.

Bankers are hopeful that the regulator may take some supportive steps to help lenders move to the new benchmarking framework."

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has asked SBI not go ahead with its plans to sell the overseas oil & gas assets of Videocon Industries in its bid to recover some of their dues from the bankrupt group.

Asking for maintaining the status quo, the NCLT said if SBI is allowed to execute the sale as advertised, the Videocon Group may suffer an irreparable losses if this tribunal in future takes a view that the assets in question belong to or owned by the group.

These subsidiaries are special purpose vehicles (SPVs) specifically incorporated by Venugopal Dhoot for holding foreign oil and gas assets for and on behalf of the group, the tribunal said in its order dated September 7.

Therefore, it said, the creditors of these SPVs have lodged their claims with the RP. However, on merits the matter is still sub judice, the tribunal added.

""SBI is hereby prohibited to go ahead with the advertisement and is directed to maintain the status quo till the decision is pronounced on merits,"" the NCLT said.

The order came after SBI has advertised to sell the upstream oil and gas assets of Videocon in Brazil and Indonesia inviting expression of interests (EoIs).

Videocon Industries had earlier requested NCLT to include Videocon Energy Brazil and Videocon Indonesia Nunukan Inc in the ongoing corporate insolvency resolution process, after its lenders invited bids for these assets to recover part of their debt.

The Videocon group along with its with 15 operating companies, owes over Rs 90,000 crore to lenders and is among the 40 largest defaulters identified by the Reserve Bank in its first list for insolvency in late 2016."

The Country's largest public sector bank -- State Bank of India -- sought issuance of 147 Look Out Circulars (LoC) in the last five months in connection with bank fraud cases, an RTI response from the bank said.

Data shows that the bank started seeking LoC from the Bureau of Immigration from April this year.

Between April and August, it issued request seeking LoC against 147 individuals to prevent them from leaving the country, the bank said in response to a Right to Information query filed by Pune-based activist Vihar Durve said.

On October 12, 2018, the Home Ministry included Chairman, Chief Executive Officers and Managing Directors of public sector banks in the list of individuals who can seek issuance of Look Out Circulars against offenders to prevent their escape from the country, it said.

According to data provided in Parliament in December last year, about 49 economic offenders have escaped to different countries and the government is making attempts to bring them back.

Fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya, diamantaire Mehul Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi, industrialists Nitin and Chetan Sandesara are among 58 economic offenders probed by the CBI, Enforcement Directorate and other agencies who have escaped abroad, it says.

Although top officials of public sector bank were empowered last year to seek issuance of LoC against individuals, relevant guidelines were framed by the Indian Banks' Association in March this year, the Association told Durve.

The guidelines were considered necessary after public sector banks approached the Association seeking legal protection and immunity available to police and the CBI while issuing the LoCs, it said.

Durve had approached the Finance Ministry seeking to know details about the request for issuance of LoC received from various authorities between 2017 and 2019, action taken on them among other things.

The Finance Ministry transferred the application to the Home Ministry and Public Sector Banks to furnish the information.

The Home Ministry then transferred the application to the Bureau of Immigration (BOI), which works under the Intelligence Bureau. The BOI sought refuge from disclosure under the Section 24 of the RTI Act which exempts it from the ambit of the transparency law.

However, State Bank of India in its response to Durve said it has sought issuance of 147 Look Out Circulars while Union Bank of India replied the information was not in its domain.

UCO Bank said it does not issue Look Out Circulars while Punjab and Sind Bank said their MD and CEO were authorized to issue the LoCs but ""there is no such data"" available.

Bank of Baroda said the information does not pertain to it and Canara Bank said no requests for LoCs were made by it in the period.

In FY19, the banking sector reported 6,801 frauds involving Rs 71,542.93 crore as against 5,916 cases involving Rs 41,167.04 crore reported in 2017-18, the Reserve Bank of India has said in its latest report.

Among bank groups, PSBs, which have the largest market share in terms of lending, accounted for the majority of frauds reported in 2018-19. It was followed by private sector banks and foreign banks.

n the reporting year, state-run banks reported 3,766 cases of frauds worth Rs 64,509.43 crore. The report said that the average lag between the date of occurrence of frauds and its detection by banks was 22 months.

The average lag for large frauds, i.e. Rs 100 crore and above, amounting to Rs 52,200 crore reported during 2018-19, was 55 months,"" it said.

Cheating and forgery were the major component, followed by misappropriation and criminal breach of trust. Fraud cases involving an amount of less than Rs 1 lakh (i.e., small-value frauds) were only 0.1% of the total amount involved in 2018-19, the report showed."

The big news of late in the financial sector is govt’s decision to merge public sector banks, trimming their number from 27 to 12 over the next couple of years or so. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman unveiled a plan that will merge as many as 10 public sector banks into four entities. As the centre attempts to boost economic growth following a six-year low, this consolidation is expected to create fewer, and stronger, lenders. Sitharaman announced the merger is being undertaken in order to revive and revitalise the banking sector to stay on course for the govt’s stated target of touching $5 trillion as an economy. Apart from the merger, the centre announced that Rs 55,250 crore upfront capital will be infused into the PSBs.

As the disappointment over the underwhelming 5% GDP growth last quarter grows, the second merger of public sector banks in recent times is, according to Mint, “the widest rearrangement of the banking sector since the nationalisation of 14 banks in July 1969.”

In this episode of Digging Deeper, we look at the merger in some detail, what it means for the sector, and also take a look briefly at what the future could look like for the banking sector in India.

27 become 12

Nirmala Sitharaman announced four new mergers. Three banks - Punjab National Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, and United Bank of India - will combine to form what will become India’s second-largest lender. That entity will have a combined total of 18 lakh crore business, with India’s second largest branch network - 11,437 branches.

Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank will merge to form another large entity which will be the fourth largest PSB, with business worth 15.2 lakh crore. It will have 10,324 branches - the third largest network in India.

Merging Union Bank of India with Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank will create the country’s fifth largest PSB, with business worth Rs 14.6 lakh crore, and 9,609 branches - the fourth largest network.

When Indian Bank merges with Allahabad Bank, the new entity will be the seventh largest PSB, with Rs 8.08 lakh crore of business.

According to Business Today, these new entities will control “two-thirds of India's banking in terms of advances and deposits are meant to create a stepping stone to India's $5 trillion GDP target.” Here’s a number that will make all this PSB merge business easier to remember:

India will have 6 large public sector banks with Rs 10 lakh crore-plus balance sheets, two national banks and four regional banks.

Indian Overseas Bank, Uco Bank, Punjab and Sind Bank, and Bank of Maharashtra - these banks have a strong regional focus and will continue to operate as separate entities. Bank of India and Central Bank of India will also continue to operate separately as before. For PSBs as a whole, there will be 12 public sector banks in place of 27 public sector banks in 2017. Those 12 will include State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda. Sitharaman said such consolidation of public sector banks will give them scale.

The centre also announced and upfront capital infusion of Rs 55,250 crore for credit growth & regulatory compliance to support the economy. PNB will receive 16,000 crores; Union Bank 11,700 crores; Canara Bank 6,500 crores; Indian Overseas Bank 3,800 crores; Central Bank of India 3,300 crores; Bank of Baroda 7,000 crores; Indian Bank 2,500 crores, and Uco Bank will receive 2,100 crores. United Bank will see an infusion of 1,600 crores while Punjab and Sind Bank will get 750 crores from the centre.

Ms Sitharaman also announced other measures over the last few weeks that were intended to help lift India’s economy as an increasing number of indicators show it slowing down. According to the Economic Times, she announced a “rollback of the super-rich tax on foreign and domestic equity investors, exemption of startups from 'angel tax', a package to address distress in the auto sector...in an effort to boost growth” besides the infusion of capital into public sector banks.

She also claimed gross NPA level has come down heavily and that the centre is monitoring large loans to avert frauds. She also claimed that the sanctioning and monitoring of loans have been separated, and special agencies have been formed to monitor loans above Rs 250 crore to avoid a Nirav Modi-like situation.

This is not the first consolidation of public sector banks - in 2018, the centre approved the merger of Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with Bank of Baroda that become effective from the start of the current fiscal. That merger created a new, improved Bank of Baroda that is the third-largest bank by loans in the country. The govt claimed no retrenchment, or layofffs, had taken place after the merger of Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank, and that “the staff has been redeployed and best practices in each bank have been replicated in others.”

In 2017, State Bank of India absorbed five of its associates - State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore and State Bank of Hyderabad- and the Bharatiya Mahila Bank.

The FM added that in order to make managements accountable to their respective boards, a board committee of nationalised banks will appraise the performances of seniors like general managers, managing director etc. According to a report in Mint, “Post consolidation, the boards will be given flexibility to introduce chief general manager level as per business needs. They will also recruit chief risk officer at market-linked compensation to attract best talent.” Further, Risk Management Committees of banks will be empowered to veto management decisions and the banks board bureau will conduct leadership programs for bankers.

Does it actually help?

The government has listed three broad gains from the consolidation. They called it 'Unlocking potential through consolidation'. Let’s examine them briefly:

The first benefit is enhanced capacity to increase credit. The consolidated entities will have a higher capacity to lend, but also need capacity building, especially in project appraisal, risk management and monitoring. A bank like SBI, with its huge balance sheet, has also found itself in trouble with similar asset quality issues as other PSBs.

The second gain the govt claimed is strong national presence and global reach. But these PSBs already control two-thirds of all banking in India. As far as global reach goes, Indian banks have a lot to catch up. Competition from private banking institutions is eating into the share of PSBs, thanks to better digitisation, faster processing of loans, and much better customer service.

The third potential gain is the operational efficiency gains that reduce the cost of lending. This is one area where the entire operating model has to change. PSBs still operate in an old fashioned manner. Banking has changed significantly in the last decade, with product-focused banks. We now have retail banks, small finance banks, payments banks and more. Meanwhile, PSBs seem to be caught in the relatively outmoded loop of corporate banking while private banks are exiting the space due to asset-liability management issues.

One analysis in Business Today, writing about PSBs, concluded, “The PSB model of banking with government ownership, control and also lending support to government's agenda (priority sector, financial inclusion, Mudra, etc.) has been a big stumbling block for bringing about a change in their functioning. The merger announcement doesn't address the core structural and fundamental issues plaguing the PSBs. The setting up of Banks Board Bureau...was path-breaking, but this model was not pursued to its logical end. The power of BBB was restricted only to appointments of senior management and directors. The government didn't extend BBB's scope to human resource (HR) reforms, NPA and stressed assets resolution, risk management, etc.”

That said, the mergers are all somewhat similar in nature. Prakash Agarwal, Head - Financial Institutions at India Ratings, observed, ""The mergers are mostly among larger banks with absorbing bank not necessarily in strong health.” They all face similar issues like falling profitability, asset quality deterioration, an ageing workforce, and laggardly approach to digitisation. They all are also corporate banks in nature while retail banking is still very small.

Rating agency Moody's upgraded the outlook on Punjab National Bank yesterday from 'stable' to 'positive'. PNB is, as mentioned earlier, slated to merge Oriental Bank and United Bank of India with itself. The agency said PNB receiving a positive outlook reflects Moody's view that the bank's baseline credit assessments are likely to improve following capital infusion from the government, and its financial metrics will also gradually improve. That said, Moody's did caution that it could lower PNB's BCA and ratings, or change the rating outlook to stable, if asset quality, profitability, and capital deteriorate on a standalone basis or as a result of the merger.

It was suggested at a meeting by the 10 banks that they should form joint committees on various verticals, under an apex committee to oversee the process. For instance, different committees with representatives from all of the entities to be merged could work on various parts - like risk management, products, technology or policy. The apex committee for the merger will anchor the process. Business Standard reported that the meeting was anchored by the ministry of finance, and the more on processes considering the many statutory and legal stipulations involved in a merger. Many senior pros across all the banks are involved in the world on the mergers. One of the bankers said, “We do not want the feeling of large banks taking over control of small banks to dominate the process. Best practices of various banks will be adopted to get business benefit for an organisation, post merger. The priority is minimal disruption to business and customers.” Meanwhile, Rajkiran Rai, MD and CEO of Union Bank of India, said it was more of learning from Bank of Baroda’s experience of merging with Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank.

State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar said the biggest advantage is that bigger banks have greater ability to absorb shocks, reap economies of scale as well as the enhanced capacity to raise resources without depending on the exchequer.

That is, of course, no guarantee of success. SBI itself is an example. As Business Today pointed out, India’s largest bank does not figure in the top quartile in terms of performance. An analysis in BT explained the situation like this: “Product differentiation is completely missing and it seems the technology platform was one of the major drivers for deciding the banking mix of banks. Do we need more clones of each other? Experts suggest there should be a differentiation in terms of product category, say SME or emerging corporate-focused banks or purely retail banks or large corporate banks. Currently, there are specialised banks in the market. For instance, HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, etc. are emerging as retail banks. There are Bandhan Bank and a host of small finance banks that are focused on catering to unbanked and underserved segments of microloans. In a slowing economy where the asset quality deterioration of PSBs has still not receded, the merger move could be counterproductive.“

Anil Gupta, Vice President at rating agency ICRA, told BT, “The choking of management bandwidth should not result in a slowdown in credit flow to the economy.”

On the other hand, an analysis in BloombergQuint approved of the centre’s move. The report said, “This initiative is a welcome move in the right direction...One of the causes for the slowdown was the reduction in lending following the financial problems we saw from the IL&FS issues since last September. Consequently, the banks started going slow on lending to NBFCs, which in turn did not have the money to lend for purchases of cars, two-wheelers, houses, etc. That aggravated the slowdown caused by poor and erratic monsoon as well as the lingering effects of demonetisation and GST. This initiative by the central government is a measure to help improve banks in their capital adequacy.”

That analysis also explained that the central government, the owner of the PSBs, is trying to improve the governance of these banks. We have witnessed in the past how ineffectively these organizations were run. There were news reports on lending decisions being made not on merit but based on other considerations. Bloomnberg’s column explained, “The improvement in governance is focused on objectives sought to be achieved, systems and processes within the bank itself, merit-based lending and oversight by the board. The government had taken a decision in the past on the separation of the role of the chairman and the managing director—earlier the public sector banks were run by one person who was chairman and managing director, but this separation is not efficiently implemented. It should be implemented immediately by giving...more powers to the chairman so that the chairman has some oversight and responsibility over the board and also over the chief executive officer.”

According to Moody's, the govt’s measures also give rise to some execution challenges and do not yet reflect the potential positive impact on the banks' ratings. It is worth noting that public sector bank shares have been on a selling spree following the government announcement to merge banks.

What do the experts say?

PNB’s MD and CEO, Sunil Mehta, said this merger will be beneficial for the banking system, and the country as a whole. He said the merger of three banks will bring a lot of synergies into the existing entities and that the capital infusion announced by the government for the merged entity is adequate. He added, “All the requirements of the bank, including the minimum regulatory requirement as well as the growth requirements have been completed while working out the Capital infusion.”

Canara Bank MD and CEO RA Sankara Narayanan said the move will provide better opportunities to do quality business. He explained, “we will be taking the proposal to the board in the next 7-10 days, and once we get the approvals from the government and the gazette notifications, the actual integration may happen sometime in first week of April.”

Arundhati Bhattacharya, former chairman, State Bank of India, told ET, “I have always said that India needs bigger banks…many PSBs were sub par in size and this merger will help them...The kind of investments one needs to make in compliance and technology is enormous and…the return on investment is not enough (for smaller banks). The bigger the entity, the stronger you become.”

Kuntal Sur, partner at PwC India, said, “All these banks were thin at the top because they were struggling to get good quality GMs and CGMs, and these mergers will create the bandwidth for better midmanagement. This will, in turn, help in better loan monitoring, overseeing the end-use of funds, and better recovery.”

Saurabh Tripathi, partner, Boston Consulting Group, explained, “A bigger bank helps in more independent decision making. SBI is a case in point...Its size and scale allow its management the bandwidth and stature to deal with government ministries with confidence and make faster decisions. The smaller banks still wait for government signaling.”

Conversely, a report by Credit Suisse claimed the merger is unlikely to revive credit growth or have meaningful cost synergies. The report said, “Coupled with the ongoing moderation in growth for private banks led by auto sector slowdown and increased cautiousness, credit growth, thus, is unlikely to be revived by PSB mergers."" It explained that the merger is unlikely to meaningfully revive the flow of credit to the liquidity pressed NBFCs - given the already high share of NBFC exposure in constituent banks, the four new entities will have more than 10% of their loan exposure towards NBFCs. About cost synergies, the report said that “the limited flexibility on restructuring and rationalisation indicates that meaningful cost synergies from PSB mergers are unlikely. While the large recapitalisation improves the capacity for banks to grow loans, recent experience of State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda indicates that focus on integration impacts near-term growth .” The report summarized that the merged banks will continue to depend on external infusions inviting frequent dilutions.

Taking a middle path, a report by Centrum Broking Research claimed, “In our opinion (and going by recent precedence), consolidation has generally been near-term detrimental to the stronger (acquiring) banks and an extended integration period remains a challenge for these entities...We believe the proposed mergers will face near-term challenges by way of integration of processes, human resources, consolidation of financials, and branch network rationalisation. The report claimed the consolidated banks will likely see an improvement in economies of scale and efficiency of operations over the medium-long term."

While there is a slowdown in the automobile sector, affordable housing segment is showing a pickup and home loans are growing, State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar told CNBC-TV18 in an exclusive interview.

“For home loans, the growth is very good. SBI is still growing at 18 percent,” he noted.

“If you look at our country, the demographics have not undergone a change. In many countries, demographics itself becomes an issue for reviving the economy. So, we are not in that situation. India remains an aspirational country. So that has not changed. The mood is down a bit,” Kumar said, while commenting on the current economic slowdown.

The flurry of activity in the government shows that the Centre is fully aware of the situation and there is a sincere effort to correct it wherever they can intervene, he observed.

Excerpts from the interview:

First this $5 trillion economy was very big aspirational number but now after the gross domestic product numbers of last week, it seems to be a stretch. What is your sense? Should we worry 8 percent nominal growth will make that goal very difficult by 2024?

Goal may be difficult, but still some of the underlying factors have not changed. That is what I always say. So we should not lose heart so quickly. There is still time that we can correct the situation. If I look at the flurry of activity which is happening now, even in the government, that means the government is fully aware of the situation and there is a sincere effort to correct the situation wherever they can intervene.

Otherwise, our economy, if you look at it, the demographics have not undergone a change. In many countries demographics itself becomes an issue for reviving the economy. So, we are not in that situation. India remains an aspirational country. So that has not changed. The mood is down a bit.

I agree with you, this is the first quarter of 20 quarters that this government will have and before we hit 2024, when we should hit $5 trillion but are you getting a sense after looking at? If you look at July and August, car sales, the most important lead indicator is still looking extremely despondent, are there other sectors which are giving you any encouragement?

I am hearing demand slowdown from almost all sectors, that is a fact and in auto it has been more pronounced. Even last time, when I spoke to you, I had said that auto sector requires a deeper analysis. It may not be purely cyclical, there may be certain structural changes, we cannot ignore the fact that some newcomers have come and they have to stop booking because the bookings were beyond their expectation. So the slowdown is evident in the auto sector.

You are saying auto slowdown is not economy slowdown?

That is what I said last time also. It is a sector-specific issue and auto sector particularly has become a bit of a puzzle. That will have to be addressed. There is more awareness today about environment. You have more and more cities where public transport is being promoted.

You have aggregators like Ola and Uber, so people are thinking -- do I need to own a car and bear the cost? So there are many issues. Non-banking financial companies were on the top of it; there was a slowdown in financing. So when all the factors combine, what we are seeing is an impact.

I take your point that we should not extrapolate auto sector because it is affected by digital, environmental and social factors. But when you look at the gross domestic product number from the expenditure side, consumption growth is 3.1 percent. That kind of a number we have not seen in a very long time, so do you think now you will have to worry about your retail loans?

We have to, all of us know there is a slowdown in auto loans. However, the growth is very good in home loans. State Bank of India is still growing at 18 percent. When I talk to the builders, some of them are saying that they are seeing a pickup in the affordable housing segment and inventory has come down.

Yesterday, I was having a discussion with a very prominent builder. And it was his assessment that prices have also come down. Once the affordability improves and builders have also come on board to clear the inventory, they cannot hold on to it for a long time.

Let me come to your role of a knowledge economy. Do you think this time around you are better prepared because you have now become a bank of a knowledge economy? There is more data, more analytics available, is that how you interpret or we should interpret this topic?

Knowledge economy is a wide term. When we were deliberating on what should be the topic for this year's conclave, $5 trillion was a very clear goal, now you could add quite a few things to it, that whether infrastructure will lead to $5 trillion economy or knowledge economy which is happening; it is a global phenomenon, the world is changing so fast.

By using whatever is happening on the knowledge economy front, we can improve productivity. When we talk about gross transaction value or per capita income growth, it is about the productivity of a nation. We believe that India as far as digital economy is concerned, is almost at par with anyone else; many systems have been built, for example payment system.

The capability of the lenders, particularly on the retail side, to use data analytics for what you call a faceless lending, it is faceless banking, but even to the lending there is a move and maybe we are doing it or building up the capability to do it today. But in the UK, when I was there from 2010 to 2012, you want to take a mortgage, you do not have to see your lender. Everything is automatic including your records about property. They are all digital, registration of mortgage is digital. So, it takes 24 hours to register and 24 hours to get a repossession also. This all rides on the strength of digital and that is where the productivity gains. When that productivity gain comes in, it definitely gets passed on to the consumers.

So, if you look at the mortgage rates in UK and the mortgage rates here, there is still a huge improvement possible provided the entire ecosystem moves in tandem.

This leads me to a few questions, first your mortgage announcement of 8.05 percent is quite a killer. Are you able to make money with such a fine rate?

We have to protect our margins. I have always maintained that on asset side transmission, what we have to do is to manage our liabilities.

So your net interest margins will not be hurt by this product?

No, that is what the assessment is. Anything we do, the margins have to be protected because in any case they are not very high. So, I do not consider that given all the credit cost for State Bank of India or for that matter any bank, a margin below 3 percent works; that is the floor.

This home loan, is it flying off the shelf, are there takers?

Very good response. In the first month when we launched it on July 1, we did Rs 400 crore worth of sanctions, so there is a good offtake.

Coming back to this knowledge economy theme, the banks launched the 59-minute sanctioning data base or product.

PSB 59-minute loan -- that is the name of the website.

That is the knowledge economy

That is what I talked about. Anyone who applies, they can get in-principle approval within 59 minutes. That is happening. However, there is still a process at the banks where there are still gaps because it is a new system.

Do you think interest rates can go down much further now because of this growth shock number that we have got, are you expecting 5 percent very soon?

If inflation goes down then again we will have to do adjustments on our liability side, so that the cost of funds comes down. And whatever costs come down, that will be passed on to the borrowers.

There are people now talking freely about repo rate going to 5 percent and in fact, there were research reports saying that now we will not be surprised with a dip even below 5 percent.

One thing is about all these prices in general when they go down then there is no bottom and when they go up, there is no ceiling. So we have to be very careful when we see this.

But you are not expecting that repo rate can fall below 5 percent?

It happens but then again the limitations will come.

So the need of the hour is for Reserve Bank of India to do external benchmarks?

I don’t think so because again if we believe in the market technology, we deregulated interest rate in 1991 or 1992, so why regulation around the interest rates. It can be deregulated. The RBI as a regulator has to ensure that there is complete transparency about the disclosures to the customers whether it is a depositor or a borrower. There has to be a complete transparency. What I am charging – if you are a borrower, you should understand what is the charge. There should not be any hidden charge, the communication has to be clear. How it will be applied.

Basically, you are saying that even if the repo goes below 5, there will be a problem passing on because the bank liabilities don’t fall so much?

Exactly. That is what we will have to see.

What about loans to NBFCs? The industry points out two, three hiccups; one is that PFC, REC are accounting for the large part and they hit ceiling everywhere, is that true?

That is one example of PFC, REC after merger. There is a RBI large exposure framework and they are governed by that.

Before I ask you some more questions on your knowledge economy, the merger announcement, a lot of people are looking at you and Bank of Baroda and immediately after the merger there was a fall in the total amount of lending; loan growth slowed in the quarter of the merger and a few quarters thereafter. Is that something we should be prepared for?

But we grew.

You did grow, but not immediately after the quarter, at that time it had fallen.

Immediately after the quarter it all depends on the demand also. It has nothing to do with the merger. The question is that, during this transition period, how do we manage our main bank and how the system works at those banks which will be merged. You need to take more care of the banks which will be merged.

Public sector bank shares have fallen partly because the fear is that this merger is going to initially take away the bandwidth of the management for integration and only then will they concentrate on growth. Is that a fair fear, it is expressed in the stock price?

Stock price if you ask me, at times is very irrational. I think it may be more to do with the overall sentiment -- that is one, and merger – market may be seeing that it is not value accretive; but that may not be value accretive the short term. However, this was a recommendation which was made 25 years ago and there will never be a right time.

You have gone through a merger, that is why I am asking you, initially a management bandwidth does get bogged down by integration, doesn’t it?

I have a huge number of people to handle all of this. There was a dedicated team which handled the merger and it was working one year before on the merger. Why did SBI merger go so smoothly? Because the preparation before the merger was very good and in eight weeks we did the data integration also.

If you speak about the data integration, starting from April 1, 2017 and May 28, 2017, the data merger of six banks had happened. However, that may not be the case with the other institutions.

SBI Card will soon launch RuPay credit cards, a development which will give a boost to the homegrown payment network in the fast growing segment. Presently, the credit card segment is dominated by the US-based payment gateways like Visa and Mastercard.

RuPay is the first-of-its-kind domestic debit and credit card payment network of India developed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an umbrella organisation for operating retail payments and settlement systems.

""We will be (launching RuPay based credit card) soon. There is a last agreement that is left out at the end of NPCI level. I think NPCI is going to send it any day and we will be launching some products,"" SBI Card MD and CEO Hardayal Prasad said in an interview to PTI.

Expressing confidence that RuPay credit card will be launched in this fiscal only, Prasad said, ""It's just a matter of time. The Rupay will become very popular and will be used in India aggressively. I have no doubts on it"".

He said that there is a big ""nationalistic segment"" which is insisting on RuPay cards. About one-third of the cards being issued by India's largest lender State Bank of India are RuPay cards, he said.

""There are class of customers who want RuPay card. There are those nationalistic people who say 'give us only Rupay cards'. So I am very upbeat,"" he said.

The company may issue both RuPay as well as Visa/Mastercard to its customers, specially who travel abroad, Prasad said.

As of now, RuPay cards are accepted only in few countries, including Singapore and Bhutan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently launched the card in UAE.

RuPay has also tied-up with international players like Discover, Japan Credit Bureau and China Union Pay to enhance its international acceptance.

Prasad further said that SBI Card has rolled out its chatbot 'ILA' (Interactive Live Assistant) on its mobile app to further enhance consumer experience.

ILA has 40 plus innovative features making SBI Card one of the first in the industry to offer a complete suite of self-service functionalities increasing convenience for the customers, he said.

""Since its release, SBI Card's chatbot has successfully resolved over 14 million queries with over 97 percent accuracy,"" he added.

SBI Card had 90 lakh customers at end-July with a market share of 17.9 percent.

According to Prasad, the company has been adding 3 lakh cards per month since December 2018."

It is too late to exit stocks from the existing portfolio that are hitting 52-week lows, and if someone is looking to buy then this is an opportunity to pick some good names like L&T, Axis Bank, SBI, JSW or Tata Steel, Mehul Kothari, Sr Technical Analyst at IndiaNivesh Securities Limited, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts:

Q: How is the market likely to react to measures announced by the Finance Minister on August 23?

A: Nifty recovered more than 200 points from the day’s low on August 23, on the hopes that government might rollback FPI surcharge. We are likely to see a gap-up opening of around 100-150 points on August 26.

In such a scenario, 11,000 would remain an immediate hurdle for the markets.

Q: Another muted week for Indian markets weighed down by both global and domestic cues. What is your outlook on markets for the coming week?

A: Nifty not only breached the previous year’s close of 10,862 but also sneaked below the recent swing low of 10,780. We had a positional target of 10,600 on the Nifty, and in the recent session, we already saw 10,637.

Going ahead, we expect the things to settle down due to various technical factors. First and foremost, we are now in the demand zone of 10,900–10,500, where the index consolidated from Dec 2018 to Feb 2019 before shooting up to an all-time high.

We expect this to happen again. In addition, the number of oversold Nifty stocks has reached 14. Historically, we have seen that in such a situation, there is a sharp pullback in the markets.

Further, in derivatives, the long-to-short ratio of FIIs in index futures has dipped below 30. Since Feb 2018, we observed that such large short positions in index futures are followed by short covering in the index.

Thus, all the above factors indicate that there could be a bounce in the index in the coming weeks in the range of 11,000–11,180. This view will be negated once the Nifty breaks 10,500 decisively.

Q: More than 500 stocks hit a fresh 52-week low on the BSE on August 23, mostly from the small and mid-cap space. What should investors do if they hold any of them in their portfolio?

A: It’s too late to exit the stocks from the existing portfolio if they are of good quality. In fact, for fresh buyers, this is an opportunity to buy some good names like L&T, Axis Bank, SBI, JSW or Tata Steel.

Q: What is your call on the rupee which has already hit 8-month low?

A: For the near term, technically, we expect 72.50 to act as strong resistance for the USD-INR pair which has already reached 72.00 mark.

Before clearing 72.50 on the upside, we expect the pair to retest 71-70.50 levels in the coming weeks. Thus, there could be some recovery in the rupee.

Q: Any big triggers that investors have to watch for the coming week?

A: Yes, the outcome of the Jackson Hole meeting is of much importance for medium-to-long-term investors since it will lay out the trajectory for interest rates in the US.

However, for short-term traders, we have the F&O expiry on the domestic front, which is nowadays not a big event (after the introduction of weekly options). We expect the series to end on a higher-end, at least from the current levels.

State Bank of India (SBI) on August 23 said it will not reduce the savings bank (SB) interest rate further and hold the same at the existing level of 3 percent for customers with balances above Rs 1 lakh.

Customers with savings balance up to Rs 1 lakh will continue to get the rate of interest at 3.50 percent, the bank further said.

The Public lender in a media release said it has decided to maintain the status quo to protect the interest of Savings bank depositors.

On the other hand, on account of falling interest rates and surplus liquidity, SBI has realigned its interest rate on term deposits with effect from August 26.

""The bank has slashed retail term deposit rates by 10-50 bps across tenors as well as bulk term deposit rates by 30-70 bps across tenors,"" the press release said.

RBI in its third bi-monthly policy had reduced repo rate by 35 bps (from 5.75 percent to 5.40 percent) with effect from August 7, 2019. Had this rate cut been transmitted to savings bank deposits, the applicable returns on SB deposits with balances above Rs 1 lakh would have dropped to 2.65 percent (275 bps below Repo rate, i.e. 5.40 percent) with effect from September 1, 2019.

With effect from May 1, 2019, SBI had linked the interest rate on Savings Bank deposits (for balances above Rs 1 lakh) with the repo rate (i.e. 275 bps below repo rate) without changing the rate of 3.50 percent for SB balances up to Rs 1 lakh.

State Bank of India, the largest commercial bank in terms of assets, deposits, branches, customers and employees, is also the largest mortgage lender in the country. As on June 30, 2019, the bank has a deposit base of over Rs 28 lakh crore with CASA ratio of 45.1 percent and advances of over Rs 19 lakh crore.

The bank claims to commands around 35 percent and 36 percent of market share in home loans and auto loans, respectively."

Banks have become increasingly selective and cautious while lending to non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) after the IL&FS defaults last year. As a result, NBFCs with expertise in lending to niche areas stand a better chance to receive bank funding as against those with mixed portfolios.

“Instead of just going with their ratings, we are looking at their risks and how they are addressing them. The more comfort we get from the NBFCs who are addressing those risks better, the more we are willing to lend to them,” said Arijit Basu, Managing Director, State Bank of India (SBI). “We are looking at all NBFCs. The only thing is that earlier we were not looking at their underlying portfolio as closely as we are doing now,” he added.

The credibility of credit rating agencies also took a hit after top-rated papers saw multiple downgrades in a snap.

Pallav Mohapatra, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Central Bank of India also said the lender is now interested in knowing what is the size and nature of NBFCs exposure to each sector. “Banks are be extending loans to NBFCs who are into niche areas,” Mohapatra said. “But if they have a mixture of onward lending then it will be difficult to know where the money going,” he added.

Over the past few months, the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced several measures to push liquidity from the banking system to the needy NBFCs. However, reluctance to lend amid risk-averse scenario has created a bottleneck of funds to the sector.

“The lending activity by banks depends on their risk perception. And we cannot tell the banks to whom to lend and to whom not to,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said after announcing a fourth straight rate cut in the August policy review. “As a regulator, we cannot say that; it is for banks to consider and examine individual loan applications, individual applications for credit and give loans. So, far RBI is concerned, we are providing an enabling situation where the banks should be able to ensure better credit flow,” he added.

Basu said the measures taken by the government and RBI were “fairly adequate” but there is a need for a faster deepening of bond markets so that smaller NBFCs can have access to long term financing that banks cannot provide."

It has been almost a year since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) laid out the framework for co-origination of loans by banks and non-deposit taking non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) in the priority sector. Banks are now looking at NBFCs with digital platforms to explore this route. While some have announced their tie-ups recently, others are still working out the details.

""We have gone on the platform with one company that primarily lends to the SME sector. We are in discussion with 4-5 NBFCs at the moment,"" said Arijit Basu, Managing Director, State Bank of India (SBI). He added that the lender is looking at opportunities in the areas where NBFCs have expertise in lending. It may take a few more months to finalize them, he said.

In April, SBI announced tie-up with Paisalo Digital for disbursement of loans with ticket size of Rs 10,000 to Rs 2 lakh in agriculture and small and medium enterprises. The NBFC has operations in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Bihar.

Other lenders like Bank of Baroda and Union Bank of India are also in talks with such NBFCs. While the NBFCs will help with on-boarding of more customers, banks will provide customer service and grievance redressal to the borrowers.

""The model will help us connect the last mile for micro-lending in areas which are inaccessible by banks,” said senior official at Union Bank of India. The official added that the bank is also in talks with a few digital lending platforms and will ink the deal in next few months. ""The product is being developed and will require testing before we are ready to launch,"" the official said.

As per the norms issued by RBI in September last year, the arrangement should involve sharing of risks and rewards between banks and NBFCs, with the later taking minimum of 20 percent credit risk by way of direct exposure. Also, the NBFC will have to give an undertaking to the bank that its contribution towards the loan amount is not funded out of borrowing from the co-originating bank or any other group company of the partner bank.

Bank of Baroda has also signed an agreement for co-origination of loans with ECL Finance, a subsidiary of Edelweiss Financial Services in June for MSME, self-employed and priority sector groups.

Bank lending to NBFCs took a hit after a series of defaults in the sector last year. With lenders reluctant to increase their exposure directly to NBFCs, the co-origination route will allow them to help the troubled sector get back on track with their lending business.

Latest data from RBI showed that bank credit to NBFCs has shrunk by one percent since the start of current financial year. However, on year-on-year basis, the lending grew by 37.6 percent as on June 21, 2019. Meanwhile, bank lending to priority sector grew 10.2 percent as compared to 6.3 percent last year."

The platform is secure and will eliminate the requirement of using debit cards, Kumar said.

""A customer can make bill payments and can do digital transactions by using the YONO cash feature. We are considering establishing close to 10 lakh YONO Cash Points in 18 months. Nearly 70,000 Cash Points have already been established,"" he said at a press conference.

The bank has no plans to discontinue debit cards but increased use of the digital platform will itself reduce the requirement of the debit cards, he said.

YONO is a digital banking platform of State Bank of India (SBI) and customers can use it on their smartphones to withdraw cash, make transactions and payments.

He added that the bank's new offer about repo rate-linked home loan is getting good response from customers. It is the customers' choice either to go with the new product or with the MCLR-linked home loan, Kumar added.

Talking about the slowdown in the automobile sector, he said there are certain trends in the market and they need to be analysed.

""It is an apparent global trend now that people are shifting from vehicle ownership to vehicle rental model due to several reasons like uncertainty of jobs and convenience. The trend should be analysed to figure out how much it is impacting the automobile industry,"" he said.

He also said there was a need to look into the agriculture sector in order to make it commercially viable sector.

""Due to issues in productivity, it sometimes becomes difficult for farmers to repay the loan. The government takes decision for loan waiver but despite the loan waiver, the condition of farmers does not improve, therefore, it should be looked into to ensure that the sector becomes commercially viable and the condition of farmers also improves,"" he said.

The banker also highlighted the advantages of YONO app for the agriculture sector. He said fertilisers, seeds, agriculture tools and equipments can be purchased on reasonable price by using YONO Mandi app."

Customers can avail the cheaper loans with added benefits such as waiver in processing fees, pre-approved digital loans and loans with no escalation in interest rates spread across various categories, SBI said in a statement.

The bank has not specified the time period for which this festival offer would be valid. However, the move would be followed by the other lenders as well.

""SBI has waived processing fees on car loans during festival season. The bank is offering lowest interest rate starting from 8.70 percent to customers opting for car loan, with no escalation in interest,"" it said.

No escalation will ensure that the customer will not have to face fluctuation in the interest rate.

For customers applying for a car loan online through the bank's digital platform like YONO or website, a 25-basis point concession on interest rate can be availed, it said.

The salaried customers can also avail the loan up to 90 percent of the car's on-road price, it said.

Recently, SBI reduced marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 15 bps due to which overall home loan interest rate is now reduced by 35 bps since April 2019.

Currently, the bank offers cheapest home loan with an interest rate of 8.05 percent as repo rate-linked home loan and this rate will be applicable to all existing and new loan from September 1, it said.

With regard to personal loan, it claimed Rs 20 lakh will be available at the lowest interest rate starting from 10.75 percent with the longest repayment tenure of 6 years, reducing equated-monthly instalment (EMI) burden on the customers.

Additionally, salary account customers can avail pre-approved digital loans up to Rs 5 lakh through YONO.

Education loan would be available at an attractive interest rate of starting from 8.25 percent for up to Rs 50 lakh and up to Rs 1.50 crore for studies in India and abroad, respectively.

Despite, the tepid response, the bank, however, is planning to extend the scheme to auto buyers, especially car loans, Kumar said.

He said a businessman having turnover of up to Rs 25 crore can get an in-principle approval for a loan of up to Rs 5 crore within 59-minutes under the scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last November.

""The platform should have been very successful, but I think the awareness about it is yet to reach the targeted audience, that is MSMEs,"" Kumar told the annual banking conference Fibac.

He said up to 90 percent of MSMEs, which are called the backbone of the economy because of employing the maximum number of people, can get loans under the scheme.

""It can become a very powerful platform, the only thing is lack of awareness,"" he reiterated.

The chairman of the country's largest lender said the algorithm analyses the inputs like GST payments, income tax payments and the cash-flow statements while making a decision on the amount of loans a borrower is eligible for.

Kumar said the bank is also planning to extend the scheme to car and auto loans because all the loans in this category are in the same quantum.

In an apparent reference to the fear among bankers to sanction loans because of being held accountable in the future, Kumar said he has given instructions down the hierarchy that no one will be held accountable for decisions done by the algorithm.

He said the bank staff should do post-sanction monitoring, documentation and disbursal alone.

According to a recent media report, since the launch of the 59-minute loan scheme by public sector banks, 50,706 loan proposals were given in-principle approvals of which 27,893 loans were sanctioned as of end March 2019.

Addressing the same event Amitabh Chaudhry, the managing director and chief executive of the third largest lender Axis Bank also discounted the so-called growth in MSME loans saying the incremental lending is not actual lending helping the economy but banks buying out stressed assets.

""What constitutes as SME loan growth for banks is coming from the buyout of portfolios from stressed financiers and must not be construed as a sign of the economy benefitting as this is not fresh lending,"" he said."

If the largest lender SBI has its way, it may herald the beginning of the end of the ubiquitous debit cards from the banking system as the bank plans to promote more digital payment solutions and eliminate the plastic cards.

This is despite the huge reliance on debit cards by customers of SBI which services a fifth of the population.

""...it is our wish to eliminate the debit cards, and am sure we can eliminate them,"" chairman Rajnish Kumar said, speaking at the annual Fibac here Monday.

He said there are around 90 crore debit cards in the country as against 3 crore credit cards, and pointed out to digital solutions like its own 'Yono' platform as the key for achieving a debit card-less country.

Kumar said through the Yono platform, one can withdraw cash at the automated teller machines or pay for purchases at a merchant establishment without having a card at all.

He said the bank has already set up 68,000 'Yono cashpoints' and is in the process of scaling it up massively to over 1 million in the next 18 months, which will make the necessity to have a card even less.

Additionally, the Yono platform can also give credit for buying certain merchandise, making the credit card in the pocket also as a ""stand-by"", Kumar said.

In the next five years, there will be a limited need to have any plastic cards in your pocket, Kumar said, pointing out that virtual coupons is the future.

He said at present, the QR code is also a very inexpensive way of ensuring payments."

Sticky lending rates on home, auto and other loans may see some respite as banks have started passing on the benefits of past policy rate cuts. While some lenders have decided to link retail loans to the central bank's policy rate, Axis Bank is of the view that there are other ways to carry out monetary transmission.

Axis Bank's executive director Rajiv Anand said that liquidity surplus in the banking system will allow lenders to cut lending rates even under the existing framework of marginal-cost based lending rate (MCLR).

His comments come on the day when RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that the central bank expects lenders to take the initiative on external benchmarking and speed up the process to support economic growth. Das also indicated that the regulator may formalise the arrangement for better transmission.

""It is not necessary to use only external benchmarks, there are multiple avenues such that we are able to meet the requirement that the RBI wants. Given the fact that the underlying liquidity is very easy, the ability of banks now to be able to pass on, what you will now find that...even with the MCLR environment, transmission will certainly be much faster than what you've seen so far,"" Anand said.

Anand also pointed out that linking retail loans to policy rate may not be the way to go as it is more volatile than MCLR. ""Generally, we have seen that retail customers, when the rates are falling, they want to see faster transmission but remember that faster transmission will happen on the way up as well,"" he said, adding that corporate houses may prefer rates linked to policy rates since they are better placed to manage interest rate risks.

On August 17, Axis Bank lowered its MCLR by 10 basis points across tenors, in response to RBI's policy rate cut of 35 basis points earlier this month.

The RBI relased a report on external benchmarking more than a year ago but hadn't made it mandatory for banks yet. State Bank of India (SBI), the country's largest lender, was the first to voluntarily link some of its lending rates to RBI's repo rate in May 2019. Other lenders, especially state-owned, are now following the big brother but with a lag.

Punjab National Bank's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Sunil Mehta said that within a week's time, the lender will come up with a set of loan products to be benchmarked to the policy rate. Last week, lenders including Union Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank announced that they will link some lending rates to RBI's repo rate.

""Demand for credit in the economy is subdued. There is a need for stimulus in the economy"", Kumar told reporters.

He was in the city to attend the multi-level consultation programme with the branch managers of SBI in the region.

The government may widen the mandatory corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending rule to state-owned enterprises such as State Bank of India (SBI) and those formed by special acts of Parliament including Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), officials with direct knowledge of the matter said on condition of anonymity.

The government wants a similar treatment for all profit-making companies with respect to CSR obligations, irrespective of their ownership, although most state-run companies, including banks, have been spending money on activities and projects to help society and the environment even without being governed by mandatory CSR provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, the officials added.

Companies above a certain size have to spend two percent of their average profit (for the past three years) on CSR activities.

A high-level committee, which submitted its recommendations on August 13 to the government, suggested extending CSR obligation to banks registered under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. “The applicability of CSR provisions may also be extended to similarly placed entities not covered under Companies Act through necessary amendments in Companies Act and, if necessary, in their respective statutes,” the committee said in its report.

The committee, headed by Injeti Srinivas, Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), was formed in September last year to review the existing framework and formulate the road map for a coherent policy on corporate social responsibility.

A Finance Ministry spokesperson confirmed that the committee has submitted its recommendations to the government and the same would be considered by it. SBI and LIC did not offer any comment. SBI’s website, however, said that the bank has been undertaking CSR activities since 1973. It said that the bank is required to spend one percent of its profit on CSR work as per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations.

According to the website of LIC, the country’s biggest life insurer, it established LIC Golden Jubilee Foundation as a part of its corporate social responsibility. The website of another public sector bank, Bank of India, said: “The provisions of spending two percent of average profit during last three financial years is not applicable to Bank of India, it being established under Banking Companies (Acquisition & Transfer of Undertakings) Act 1970 and not under Companies Act. However, Bank of India is committed to assist under CSR for enrichment of environment and society on a sustainable basis.”

Pavan Kumar Vijay, founder, Corporate Professionals Group, said: “Provisions of CSR are applicable only to companies registered under the Companies Act. Air India, LIC etc are statutory corporations set up under special Acts of Parliament and therefore, CSR provisions are not applicable to them. The committee has accordingly recommended that the provisions of CSR may also be made applicable to these and like entities through amendments in the Companies Act or their respective Acts.”

Kaustubh Basu, Executive Director-Social Sector, PwC India, said, “In spite of the suggestions contained in the guidelines on corporate social responsibility and sustainability for CPSEs issued by the Department of Public Enterprises [DPE] in 2014 ... entities such as Air India, SBI and LIC of India fall outside the purview of CSR and any initiatives taken up by them are voluntary in nature. The report submitted by the high-level committee to the Minister of Corporate Affairs [also Finance Minister] proposes to create a level playing field and make the provisions of CSR applicable to all profit making entities.”"

Cross-border payment provider SWIFT is looking at running tests for instant international settlements with the local network in India to ensure higher speed and end-to-end transparency in transactions across the globe.

While SWIFT’s global payments innovation (gpi) provides cross-border payments service to member banks, the new ‘gpi instant’ platform will connect domestic switches to include non-gpi banks as well.

""After ensuring efficiency, transparency and trackability in cross-border payments, we are now connecting them to local networks. So, we are trying to integrate with local switches to complete the last leg of the transaction,” said Kiran Shetty, Chief Executive Officer and Regional Head, India and South Asia, SWIFT.

The ‘gpi instant’ service has already been tested with New Payments Platform (NPP) in Australia and Fast & Secure Transfers (FAST) in Singapore. SWIFT is now looking at running trials with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), among other regions, going forward.

“We’ve had successful pilots in Singapore and Australia. The tests prove that cross-border to the final beneficiary can also happen within seconds. We are now looking to move into other real-time markets like India. We want to make sure that the value is derived at every level,” Shetty added.

The trial conducted in Singapore last month involved 17 banks across seven countries. The results showed payments between all countries settle within 25 seconds. SWIFT plans to go live with the ‘gpi instant’ service globally by end of this year.

In India, 11 banks including State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank have signed up for the gpi network so far and are in the process of connecting with the cross-border payments platform. However, ‘gpi instant’ transactions made to accounts with other banks, which use the NPCI switch, will also be traceable .

Apart from speed, the network provides end-to-end visibility in a transaction. For instance, a sender will be able to track movement of their transactions till it reaches the beneficiary. It can also help authorities track suspicious transactions, amid rising cases of financial frauds and anti-money laundering activities."

Suzlon Energy has offered creditors a $1.2 billion (Rs 85 billion) bad-debt resolution plan, reports Bloomberg.

If accepted, the resolution plan suggests that the creditors, led by State Bank of India (SBI), take a 44 percent haircut on the total debt.

The news came after bondholders threatened the country’s largest wind-turbine maker of legal action after repayment default last month.

Brookfield Asset Management which was in talks to infuse fresh equity in the company dropped out and Vestas Wind Systems A/S remains as the only bid backing the settlement plan, the wire quoted sources say.

The Pune-based company has been battling heavy losses amidst rising operational costs and competition as it looks for a long-term strategic investor.

The global investment bank has said that markets could be nearing a bottom.

“We are getting to a bottom in share prices, as our valuation and sentiment indicators suggest, but risks remain on the horizon for the real economy and a slowing global economy,” Morgan Stanley said in a report.

The risk-to-reward ratio favours buying equities, but a V-shaped recovery in stocks depends on the actions of policymakers, says the August 6 report. Investors with a bit of patience will likely be rewarded well in the next 12 months.

The S&P BSE Sensex has fallen around 9 percent from its record high of 40,312.07 touched in early June. The market has continued to head south, weighed down by budget proposal of higher tax on the super rich, selling by foreign investors, slowdown in growth and escalating trade war between the US and China.

Despite the selloff, Morgan Stanley maintains its base-case scenario of 45,000 on the Sensex by June 2020, and a bull-case of 50,000. Its bear case possibility sees the Sensex at 35,000 by June 2020.

“Indian equities look attractive in a relative context amid subdued oil prices, global trade tensions and better relative valuations in what is a low-return world,” says the note.

It, however, says policy action is still needed to protect India’s relative performance, which has sunk since the budget was presented on July 5.

From a portfolio perspective, Morgan Stanley likes financials, consumer discretionary and industrials, both large-and midcaps.

Policymakers could turn to measures such as strategic divestments of public-sector companies, recapitalisation of public-sector banks, trade deal with the US and other countries, rationalisation of GST rates, a new Direct Tax Code, infrastructure spending and fiscal prudence, and a moratorium on higher taxation for FPI trusts, Morgan Stanley says.

Bajaj Auto, M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Dabur, United Spirits, SBI, HDFC, Ashok Leyland, InterGlobe Aviation, L&T, Asian Paints and Sun Pharma are among the top 20 stocks on Morgan Stanley’s focus list."

With housing loans linked to the repo rate since July, there will be a straight benefit of 35 basis points from the repo cut announced in the Reserve Bank's MPC policy on August 7, State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar told CNBC-TV18 report.

Kumar pointed out if loan rates have to come down, deposit rates cannot remain very high, adding SBI cannot afford to keep offering the existing deposit rates. The bank will review deposit rates in the next Asset Liability Committee meeting, he said.

With regard to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision to cut the repo rates and its impact on the Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR), he said, “I have maintained that repo rate and MCLR have no connection.”

“If the repo rate goes down to 5 percent, then one-year MCLR can’t be offered at its current levels,” he said, adding that SBI has headroom for growth as its credit-deposit ratio is on the lower side.

He believes NBFCs, which are retail-focused, will benefit from measures announced by the RBI in the policy.

Kumar also spoke about the stressed assets cases the bank is battling. On DHFL, he said, “We will try and achieve a resolution without going to the NCLT. We will look at a resolution that satisfies all creditors with respect to DHFL.”

SBI cut its marginal cost-based lending rates by 15 basis points within hours of a steeper 35 basis points reduction in the repo rates by the Reserve Bank to 5.4 percent in its fourth consecutive MPC policy. The revised lending rates will be effective August 10 across all tenors.

The bank's new one-year MCLR will come down to 8.25 percent from 8.40 percent per annum, the lender said in a statement."

Country's largest lender State Bank of India has announced a 15 basis points reduction in its lending rates, effective August 10 across all tenors. This is the fourth consecutive cut in the marginal cost-based lending rates (MCLR) in FY20.

State-run banks may approve personal, auto and home loans online in 59 minutes, according to a proposal that they discussed with Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as one of the measures to create demand and boost the economy, officials aware of the discussions said, requesting anonymity.

The discussions were first of a series of meetings that the government has planned over the next week with executives of several industries, Sitharaman said on August 5, promising steps to improve the state of the economy ‘fairly quickly’.

India’s economy has been facing a slowdown for about a year. The core sector growth in June slowed to 0.2 percent, the lowest monthly growth since May 2015, and weak demand forced many automobile companies to temporarily halt production.

Among the interventions discussed on August 5 was easing access to credit. The bankers suggested the in-principle approval limit on psbloansin59minutes.com portal, which is meant for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) businesses, be raised to Rs 5 crore from Rs 1 crore.

It also suggested opening up the portal to retail customers looking for home, car or personal loans, said one of the officials, asking not to be named.

Launched on November 2 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the 59-minute loan portal — which lets businesses apply for instant loans without having to visit banks — has led to 1.3 million loans being sanctioned till July 17, the Finance Ministry said in a statement to the Rajya Sabha.

“It certainly helps borrowers as it makes the process easy for them, but banks will not give loans without proper verification and documentation. Extending the same for personal and housing loans may help revive demand in sectors such as automobiles,” said a senior executive of a leading government-run bank, asking not to be named.

The August 5 meeting included senior Finance Ministry officials and top executives of banks including State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. “Today’s meeting is the first of a series of meetings that the Finance Ministry is convening to discuss current economic issues with key stakeholders, including some of the industry sectors whose growth has been affected in recent months,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement after the meeting.

Speaking at a press conference after the banking sector review meeting, Finance Secretary Rajiv Kumar said the minister will hold similar meetings with representatives of other sectors: MSMEs on August 6, automobile on August 7, financial markets on August 9, and real estate and homebuyers on August 11.

Sitharaman also said the Finance Ministry will hold discussions with representatives of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and discuss their concerns on the budget decision to impose a surcharge on the super-rich.

“I am quite open to hear them out what they have to say,” she said, adding that the meeting will be held by Economic Affairs Secretary Atanu Chakraborty soon. “The Budget, presented on July 5, raised surcharge to 25 percent from 15 percent on taxable income between Rs 2 crore and Rs 5 crore, and from 15 percent to 37 percent for income above Rs 5 crore. Although, it was not intended for FPIs, it applies to those FPIs that operate as trusts or as association of persons. FPIs operating as corporates do not attract the surcharge,” she said.

She clarified that the government has not taken any decision about how much or when it plans to issue the proposed sovereign bonds. Since the announcement, nothing more has been done in this regard due to the Ministry’s preoccupations with key legislations including amendments to the IBC, she added."

Other banks that have to pay fines ranging from Rs 50 lakhs to Rs 1.5 crore include Corporation Bank, Federal Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, United Bank of India and UCO Bank.

RBI said these banks were advised to report fraud immediately in an account as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had initiated criminal proceedings.

""It was mentioned in the budget, i know some numbers were floating around because the earlier secretary had mentioned it. After the mention in the budget there has not been much work on it because we have been busy with passing the three bills. On the sovereign bonds nothing more has been done by the ministry.

The shares of State Bank of India fell more than 5 per cent intraday to hit a near-five-month low on August 5 even as brokerage houses slashed price target, as the country's largest public sector bank missed profit expectations in the June quarter (Q1), and slippages were higher.

The stock has fallen more than 21 per cent since July 17, 2019. It was quoting at Rs 294.40, down Rs 14.05, or 4.56 per cent on the BSE at 1125 hours IST, before staging a partial recovery.

The country's largest lender reported a standalone profit of Rs 2,312.20 crore in Q1, against loss of Rs 4,875.85 crore in year-ago period. Net interest income increased 5.2 per cent year-on-year to Rs 22,938.8 crore during the quarter.

Asset quality was stable, with gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances flat at 7.53 per cent in Q1, compared to the previous quarter. However, gross slippages, at Rs 16,212 crore for the June quarter, rose by a steep 62.38 per cent year-on-year and 116.01 per cent sequentially.

Hence, the slippage ratio increased significantly to 2.83 per cent in Q1FY20, from 1.39 per cent in Q4FY19.

Brokerages retained a positive stance, but slashed the price target following the higher slippages. They see scope for higher credit cost in FY20 and see downside risks to earnings from a larger watchlist.

""Higher slippages disappointed, and Q1 net profit were below our expectations due to higher credit cost,"" said CLSA. which has a buy call on the stock but cut price target to Rs 380 from Rs 420 per share.

The global brokerage further said key disappointment was rise in SBI's delinquency ratio to 3.4 per cent of the past year’s loans, and said it sees scope for credit costs to remain higher in FY20.

However, the upside can arise from the resolution of cases at NCLT like Essar Steel, CLSA said.

Here is what other brokerages say about the SBI stock and its earnings:

Brokerage: Kotak Institutional Equities | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 390

The bank reported a weak start to FY20 with slippages at 3 per cent of loans. Higher slippage from agriculture and SME are seasonal in nature and less worrying.

Timing is uncertain but Kotak is optimistic that FY20 should be better against FY19. It maintained buy call on the stock and cut target price to Rs 390 from the previous one of Rs 410 per share.

Brokerage: IDFC Securities | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 365

The management has revised guidance of core return on assets (RoA) to 0.5-0.6 per cent from 0.6-0.7 per cent.

The brokerage cut earnings estimates and price target to Rs 365 per share, but maintained its outperform call on the stock on inexpensive valuation.

IDFC sees downside risks to earnings from a weak macro, high pension costs and the larger watchlist.

Brokerage: Citi | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 400

SBI reported healthy loan growth but slippages increased in Q1. Its Q1 net profit was below brokerage and consensus estimates, due to higher provisions (9 per cent ahead of estimates) and lower treasury income.

Loan growth was healthy at 14 per cent YoY driven by retail. Citi maintained its buy call, but slashed the target price to Rs 400 from Rs 415 per share.

SBI Q1: Expect net interest margin at 3.1% for FY20, says Chairman Rajnish Kumar

State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar expects limited improvement of the bank's net interest margins (NIMs) this financial year on the back of muted credit growth and a lack of room for further reduction in the cost of funds.

It will be very difficult for the bank to push margins up in a significant manner in the current scenario where credit growth is muted, Kumar said on an earnings call on August 2.

He added that while there could be some change in term deposit rates, the lender has done whatever it could in terms of bringing down the cost of funds.

State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar expects limited improvement of the bank's net interest margins (NIMs) this financial year on the back of muted credit growth and a lack of room for further reduction in the cost of funds.

It will be very difficult for the bank to push margins up in a significant manner in the current scenario where credit growth is muted, Kumar said on an earnings call on August 2. He added that while there could be some change in term deposit rates, the lender has done whatever it could in terms of bringing down the cost of funds.

From August 1, SBI announced sharp cut in fixed deposit rates across tenors. This will lead to lower lending rates going ahead.

There could be some respite for margins from the claw back on account of the reclassification of bad loans from the agriculture segment and higher risk premiums, he said.

""Bank is much more careful on risk premiums now, concessions are fewer,"" Kumar said, adding that the upside impact may not be more than 6-10 basis points. He expects NIMs to be at 3.1 percent by March 2020.

In April-June quarter, the bank's NIMs stood at 3.01 percent, as compared to 2.95 percent in the same period last financial year.

In terms of credit growth, SBI expects to expand its loan book by 12 percent this financial year. Kumar said that the bank is seeing the project pipeline in sectors like oil and gas, renewable energy and roads. Also, loan growth will likely be supported by public sector undertakings this year.

SBI clocked a domestic credit growth of 11.89 percent in the first quarter of current financial year. Kumar expects loan growth to pick up in the second half of the year.

On the asset quality front, SBI aims to contain its slippage ratio below 2 percent by March 2020. The bank's slippage ratio rose to 2.83 percent in the June-ended quarter, up from 1.95 percent in the same period last year."

The CNAPS, launched in 2008 by People's Bank of China (PBOC) provides real-time settlement services for all payments cleared in mainland China, as well as in all clearing banks in offshore yuan centers, such as Hong Kong.

The CNAPS system is complemented by its international counterpart, the CIPS (China International Payments System or Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payment System), launched in 2015 with the aim of boosting international use of the Chinese currency, yuan.

The CIPS already has participants from multiple countries across the globe.

The SBI is the only Indian bank to have obtained the license to do business in local currency and also inducted to the CNAPS by the PBOC as on date, K Swaminathan, Chief Executive Officer of SBI, Shanghai told PTI on August 2.

The SBI has obtained the PBOC approval in December 2016 for implementation of the CNAPS and after successful installation of various hardware and software, testing it is now connected to the PBOC live system on July 8, 2019, he said.

After being a member of the CNAPS, SBI Shanghai can also offer real time transfer of local funds within China by routing them through the PBOC.

It eliminates the need of tie up and maintenance of accounts with multiple Banks for fund transfer, he said.

The CNAPS will also be used for cross border RMB payments which are hitherto being made through local correspondent banks. This will also give SBI opportunity to do business of Bankers acceptance drafts (BAD), he said.

The SBI has started its representative office in 1997 and began its commercial operation in 2006.

Currently, it is the only Indian bank with license to deal in RMB, the local currency, as well as foreign currency.

With total customer credit of nearly USD 500 million and staff strength of 40 people that includes 32 Chinese nationals, the bank has always been at the forefront of facilitating India-China trade and investments apart from serving the Indians working in China in the field of IT and others, Swaminathan said.

The bank extends bank guarantee facility to Chinese corporates undertaking various construction, tech, and investment projects, he said.

The bank has also been extending term as well working capital credit facilities to Indian corporates and companies promoted by Indians in China to facilitate Indian investment in China, he said.

The bank has also been an active participant in local syndication arranged by major foreign as well as Chinese banks.

Other than the activities on asset side, the bank has been facilitating Indians working in China in their remittance as well as other banking needs, he said."

Country's largest lender State Bank of India has reported a standalone profit of Rs 2,312.20 crore for the quarter ended June 2019, aided by lower provisioning and stable asset quality.

Higher other income and operating income also boosted profitability, though tepid NII growth limited profits.

The bank had reported a loss of Rs 4,875.85 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, it reported a whopping 176 percent jump in profit against Rs 838.40 crore in March quarter.

Net interest income grew 5.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 22,938.8 crore in June quarter 2019, with loan growth of 13.8 percent YoY.

Domestic net interest margin contracted 1 basis point sequentially to 3.01 percent, but expanded 6bps YoY, SBI said, adding deposits growth was 7.32 percent YoY at Rs 29.48 lakh crore in Q1.

Asset quality was stable with gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances flat at 7.53 percent in Q1 compared to the previous quarter, though net NPA as a percentage of net advances inched up by 6bps sequentially to 3.07 percent in June quarter.

Gross and net NPAs, in absolute terms, declined both sequentially as well as on YoY basis, the bank said in its release.

Gross slippages at Rs 16,212 crore for June quarter increased sharply by 62.38 percent year-on-year and 116.01 percent sequentially. Hence, the slippage ratio increased significantly to 2.83 percent in Q1FY20, from 1.39 percent in Q4FY19.

""Agri slippages were high during the quarter. We are still hopeful by March 2020, we will bring slippage ratio to 2 percent or below,"" said Rajnish Kumar, Chairman while addressing press conference.

Consequently, the stock wiped out all its gains, to trade at Rs 309.40, down 2.46 percent on the BSE at 1500 hours IST.

Provisions for bad loans fell significantly by 32.80 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 11,648.5 crore in Q1. The same declined 10.65 percent YoY.

Provision coverage ratio also improved to 79.34 percent at the end of June 2019, from 78.7 percent in March 2019, and improved significantly by 1,009 bps from 69.25 percent as on June 2018.

Provisions and contingencies were lower by 44 percent sequentially and 52.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 9,183 crore, the bank said.

The lender further added that it has been holding the provision of Rs 3,553 crore for accounts covered under Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code and made provision of Rs 996 crore for arrears of wages.

Non-interest income (other income) during the quarter grew by 20 percent to Rs 8,015.4 crore compared to year-ago. Operating profit increased 10.6 percent to Rs 13,246.2 crore YoY."

The country's largest lender State Bank of India is expected to report a healthy profit in the June quarter over lower provisioning, asset quality improvement, and higher treasury income and loan growth, brokerages said. The bank will announce its quarterly earnings on August 2.

The profit is expected to be in the range of Rs 2,500-6,000 crore for the quarter, according to the brokerages considered.

SBI had posted a loss of Rs 4,875.9 crore in the corresponding quarter of the last fiscal and a profit of Rs 838.4 crore in March quarter.

According to brokerages, loan and NII growth could be in double digits with lower slippages, but other income or non-interest income may be quite strong.

""We expect loan growth of 17 percent YoY, led by growth in retail books and portfolio buyouts. NII is expected to increase by 10 percent YoY due to lower interest reversals and better recoveries from written off accounts. Non-interest income is expected to remain strong at 38 percent YoY on account of an improvement in the treasury performance and fee income,"" said Motilal Oswal which has a buy call on the stock and expects profit to be at Rs 4,820 crore for June quarter.

The brokerage further said that stress addition is likely to moderate to 1.7 percent, as it believes that most of the stress has been recorded in previous quarters.

ICICI direct also said that as slippages are expected to moderate to around Rs 6,000 crore, NPA overall provisions would be seen moderating to Rs 9,000 crore from previous highs, and investment provisions write back can lead to overall provisions down to Rs 4,990 crore.

Provisions for bad loans stood at Rs 19,228.3 crore in the June quarter 2018 and Rs 16,501.9 crore in the March quarter 2019.

Brokerages feel that with the expected fall in slippages, asset quality should improve.

According to Prabhudas Lilladher, gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances may fall to 7.23 percent in Q1FY20, down from 7.53 percent in Q4FY19.

The key issues to watch out for would be updates on the retail, SME and agri slippages; recoveries from the resolution of NCLT accounts; outlook on power assets and macro developments on asset quality.

The State Bank of India (SBI) is planning a secondary stake sale of SBI Cards Payment and Services (SBI Cards), its credit card joint venture with private equity firm Carlyle.

The bank presently holds 74 percent stake of SBI Cards and hopes to raise Rs 5,000-6,000 crore from a partial stake sale. Once through, the bank’s stake is expected to drop by 14 percent, reports the Economic Times.

The proposed initial public offering (IPO) has been pegged at Rs 8,000 crore, and SBI is in talks with multiple merchant bankers for the same by Q4FY20, the report added.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

The paper quoted a source as saying, ""This is going to be primarily a secondary sale of shares from the existing investors — SBI and Carlyle Group. SBI Cards is expected to raise about Rs 500-1,000 crore.""

The issue size, however, would depend on Carlyle’s participation in the sale. If it goes through, SBI Cards would be the first pure-play credit card company in India and would be valued between Rs 35,000-40,000 crore, the report added.

SBI and SBI Cards did not respond to ET’s queries while Carlyle was unreachable.

At least five banks are planning to raise an aggregate of Rs 62,000 crore in funds this year, according to a report by The Economic Times.

Three public sector banks (PSBs) – State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank – and two private lenders – Axis Bank and RBL Bank – are looking to raise capital to fuel growth.

It is expected that the fundraising will also help the banks grab market share from non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).

SBI intends to raise Rs 17,000 crore through the issue of bonds, the report said. Of this, Rs 7,000 crore will be raised as additional Tier 1 capital (AT1).

Axis Bank plans to raise Rs 18,000 crore through a combination of qualified institutional placements and depository receipts.

Axis Bank has already announced its intention to raise Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500 crore.

“We will raise capital in the next few months. It will happen this fiscal. We have taken an enabling resolution for raising between Rs 3,000 crore and Rs 3,500 crore, which was confirmed in the AGM last week,” RBL Bank CEO Vishwavir Ahuja told The Economic Times earlier in July.

Canara Bank, too, has announced a plan to raise up to Rs 12,000 crore through a mix of equity and bonds.

Bank of Baroda intends to raise Rs 1,500 crore through employee share purchase scheme (ESPS) and Rs 4,500 crore through AT1 bonds."
"July 30, 2019 11:39 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/sbi-tightens-lending-terms-for-auto-dealers-source-4264901.html,"The State Bank of India (SBI) has tightened lending terms dramatically for auto dealerships, according to a source and an internal memo seen by Reuters, seeking to reduce its exposure to risk from a sector in the midst of a sharp downturn.

The shadow banking crisis that began to unfold in India during mid-2018 has deepened this year. The liquidity crunch in non-bank financing, higher insurance costs and rises in taxation have served to increase the pressure on the car sector, with monthly auto sales falling by 17-20% since April.

Monthly passenger vehicle sales in June fell by the biggest margin in 18 years.

In one internal memo for financing dealers selling vehicles made by Hyundai Motor Co's India unit, SBI said it is revising the lending terms because of ""growing stress"" in the carmaker's portfolio.

Similar memos have been sent to dealerships for all other brands, said a senior SBI official aware of the matter, though Reuters has not seen memos relating to other carmakers.

As part of the revised terms, the country's largest bank by assets has decided to halt lending to dealers of Hyundai Motor India unless they provide a minimum of 25% collateral, it said in the memo.

Hyundai dealers that had already received loans from the bank will also have to provide security of between 25% and 50% of the loan amount, SBI said in the memo dated March 27 and signed by the chief general manager for supply chain financing.

Hyundai did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment outside business hours.

The company is India's second-largest carmaker with more than 16% of a market accounting for 3.3 million passenger vehicles in the year to March 31.

Japanese carmaker Suzuki Motor Corp's Indian business, Maruti Suzuki, dominates with a 50% share while rivals including Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford and Nissan also produce and sell cars in the country.

While it is known that several Indian banks have broadly tightened lending to the auto sector, specifics have not been disclosed.

""There is an auto sales slowdown and we have substantial exposure to autos. We want to stay safe and this was done to mitigate risk and protect us,"" said the SBI official, who asked not to be named because the details had not been made public.

SBI's loan exposure in the auto retail market was 718.8 billion rupees ($10.5 billion) at the end of March, according to regulatory filings.

""In view of the current slowdown in the auto sector, the bank is continuously reviewing its exposure,"" SBI told Reuters, adding that it is evaluating the situation and engaging with dealers to ensure the sector does not face any undue stress.

TIGHTER SCRUTINY

Other lenders have also become more wary of lending to dealers with credit lines from different banks.

Dipak Gupta, joint managing director at Kotak Mahindra Bank, earlier this month said some dealers were using credit lines from one bank to pay off another, and banks are now taking a harder look at such practices.

In its memo, SBI said that if a dealer had raised funding from more than three banks including SBI, the collateral requirement would be increased to a minimum of 50%. SBI has also cut the credit period for dealers to 60 days from 90 days.

The bank will also monitor stock and inventory levels on a monthly basis to keep tabs on the dealer's financial health.

The tighter scrutiny comes at a time when inventories at dealers have risen to 50-60 days of sales, up from around 45 days previously, according to industry data.

In an effort to help its dealers, Maruti Suzuki has tied up with state-run Bank of Baroda for dealer finance and is in talks with other banks to ease strict lending terms, local newspaper Mint reported earlier in July."

Cracking down in the Bhushan Steel case, the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has recommended that the Department of Financial Services (DFS), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) act against over a dozen banks for their alleged involvement in financial misappropriation carried out by the company’s promoters.

In its report that runs into over 70,000 pages, the investigating agency has charged officials of 13 banks of being hand-in-glove with the Bhushan Steel promoters, and indicated that 200 or more officials could be involved.

The company’s former MD Neeraj Singal was earlier arrested by the agency and is now on interim bail.

Two highly placed officials said SFIO’s probe found wrongdoing at multiple levels, including that of top management, in the handling of a multi-bank loan to Bhushan Steel.

“Basically the banking fraud has happened at two levels. One at the operational level, and another at management level – to cover up the operational fraud in the form screening committee meetings and the Joint Lender Forum submitting its response to RBI seeking closure of the forensic audit, suppressing material facts made out in the report,” the SFIO report said.

The SFIO submitted its 70,000-page report in a special court in Dwarka, Delhi on July 1. The report has been shared with RBI and the Central Vigilance Commission as well, to facilitate action against the banks.

It details fraudulent use of 1600 letters of credit (LoC) that tote up to Rs 45,000 crore, and the overvaluation of assets by Rs 15,000 crore.

“In this case, 13 banks were part of the Joint Lender Forum. The banks whose officials’ role clearly came out in this report are State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB), Allahabad Bank, Andhra Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce,” said one of the officials quoted above. “SFIO has been directed to share the report and make a detailed reference to CBI indicating the names of all bank officials who were prima facie involved.”

The other official quoted above said, on the condition of anonymity, “SFIO has filed prosecution case against the SBI general manager, the current PNB executive director and the managing director of Life Insurance Corporation – who was nominee director in Bhushan Steel and part of the board of the company.”

According to the annual report of Bhushan Steel, SBI and PNB recommended AK Deb and Rajesh Yaduvanshi respectively to serve as their nominee directors on the board of Bhushan Steel, while Vipin Anand was LIC’s nominee to the board.

“SFIO is directed to share the report with the Department of Financial Services (DFS) being the administrative ministry for the banks, for taking disciplinary action against the persons responsible for management fraud by endorsing a copy of the reference to DFS which is made to CBI,” a senior official in the finance ministry told Moneycontrol.

“Department of Financial Services is planning to initiate action against bankers on the basis of the SFIO report, and these officials’ count may go up to 200 at operational and management level,” the official said.

Bhushan Steel was one of the accounts in RBI’s initial list of companies referred to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code for resolution. Prior to that, the consortium led by SBI and PNB had failed to revive the company under stressed asset resolution schemes. These included S4A and 5/25 schemes for which the Joint Lenders Forum was formed by the consortium.

The case was admitted by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in July, 2017.

Emails seeking their responses, sent to all the banks named in the report, as well as RBI, remained unanswered at the time of publishing. The story will be updated once they respond.

This is not the first time that bankers have come under the net of an investigation agency. In the cases of fugitive industrialists Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi, and now Sterling Biotech, the role of bankers has come under intense scrutiny.

This week’s tactical pick is SBI Life Insurance (current market price: Rs 741).

SBI Life has been one of the fastest-growing life insurers in India with its annual premium equivalent (APE) having grown at more than CAGR of 20 percent in the past 5 years. It is now the second-largest private life insurer with market share of 20.3 percent among private insurers -- excluding LIC -- in terms of individual new business premium as of June-end. SBI Life has doubled its market share among private players since FY14.

However, our enthusiasm for the insurer is not just limited to improving market share. There is more than a reason that make us positive on the stock. Read: Ideas for Profit | SBI Life – Strong growth potential with high profitability; buy

First, SBI Life has by far the largest addressable bancassurance network consisting of more than 25,000 branches of its parent bank, SBI. SBI Life’s bancassurance partnerships with its parent bank remain exclusive. The banca channel has enabled SBI Life to grow much higher than peers over the last few years and shift towards ULIPs. Apart from being huge, the banca channel is under-leveraged, indicating a strong growth potential for SBI Life if the cross-sell efficiency of the bank improves.

Second, despite being banacassurance leader, SBI Life never defocused on its individual agency network. It has a large network of 59,000 agents and 124,000 CIFs (certified insurance facilitators) as of end FY19. Hence, despite its large bank network, its agency channel constituted 30 percent of individual rated premium in FY19 vs 15- 25 percent for peers. Higher share of agency network also indicates that SBI Life, like LIC, enjoys a strong brand.

Third, SBI Life has the lowest cost structure compared to peers with total cost ratio at 10.5 percent of gross written premium in FY19 vs 13-17 percent for peers.

Last, after staying on the sidelines for the last 3 years, SBI Life turned aggressive on the high margin protection business in FY19. In 2018-19, protection share stood at 6.8 percent of APE. As a result, value of new business (VNB) margins expanded by 150 bps to 17.7 percent in FY19.

SBI Life’s stock trades at 3.3 times trailing P/EV (price-to-embedded value), which is reasonable considering its RoEV (return on embedded value) at 17.4 percent. SBI Life, in our view, is well positioned for growth in the insurance space with many levers for further improvement in RoEV. Investors looking to participate in insurance growth story available at reasonable price should buy into the stock.For more research articles, visit our Moneycontrol Research page"

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has levied a penalty of Rs 7 crore on State Bank of India (SBI) based on findings of an inspection report. The regulatory lapses relate to bad loans classification, fraud risk management and reporting of frauds.

“Based on the inspection report and other relevant documents, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for non-compliance with directions issued by RBI,” the banking regulator said in a statement on July 15.

After considering the bank’s reply and oral submissions made in the personal hearing, RBI came to the conclusion that the aforesaid charges of non-compliance with RBI directions were substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty, it added.

The annual inspection report was based on the bank’s financial position as on March 31, 2017. These reports are typically not accessible by public but earlier this month, the RBI released inspection reports of several banks including SBI for financial years 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

The reports revealed evergreening of loans, suppression of data, sidestepping know your customer (KYC) norms, flouting anti-money laundering rules and ignoring RBI reports on deficiencies.

Separately, RBI also penalised Union Bank of India with a Rs 10 lakh fine for non-compliance of cybersecurity norms.

“Based on reports of the generation of seven fraudulent messages of a total value of $171 million through the SWIFT system of the bank in 2016, an examination of the cybersecurity framework of the bank was carried out which revealed several deficiencies,” RBI said in a press release.

The misuse of SWIFT messaging system was at the core of Nirav Modi scam that left Punjab National Bank with a Rs 14,000 crore hole in its pocket. The RBI had tightened norms for the use of the worldwide financial messaging system."
