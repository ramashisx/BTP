The analysts' bullish outlook as well as the company's performance in the current fiscal drove the surge in price.

After a volatile day, benchmark indices closed with cuts on November 24, extending the losing run to the second session. IT stocks were among the biggest drags while buying was seen in pharma and metal stocks. The headline indices have been trading in a range for a while now in the want of any significant trigger. Smallcap stocks maintained their outperformance for another session. At the close, the Sensex was down 47.77 points or 0.07 percent at 65,970.04, and the Nifty was down 7.30 points or 0.04 percent at 19,794.70. About 1734 shares advanced, 1817 shares declined, and 133 shares unchanged.

Cipla Ltd: Shares of the pharmaceutical major bounced back over 2 percent to Rs 1,198 to become the top gainer on the Nifty, a day after it slumped over 7 percent. The surge came after HSBC maintained a buy rating. The brokerage said ""We don’t assume additional risk for Gadvair for which, site transfer is underway,"" it said. The positive traction observed in its key marketed products is expected to bolster sales in the United States in FY24-26, it said.

Adani Enterprises Ltd: Shares of the flagship Adani firm rose over 2 percent to Rs 2,225. This comes after the Supreme Court said that one doesn't have to treat the Hindenburg report as being a statement of truth.

Axis Bank Ltd: Shares of the private lender gained 1 percent to Rs 1,008, extending its rally for the fourth day in a row.

HCL Tech Ltd: Shares of the IT firm fell 1.5 percent to Rs 1,309, declining for the second day in a row. Volumes were low, as nine lakh shares changed hands as against the one-week average of 19 lakh.

The future of IT companies will be heavily influenced by the commentary from the Federal Reserve

The results of major IT companies for the quarter ended September 2023 are out, and the report card is not looking good. India’s five largest IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Wipro and LTIMindtree — saw a muted quarter due to demand slowdown, macroeconomic headwinds and weak discretionary spending. Analysts don't see tailwinds for these companies in the near term, either.

While the management talk across companies has stressed how deal wins have been good and that they executed well in a tough environment, brokerages are of the view that most IT majors have not been able to convert deal wins into growth.

All five companies reported better-than-expected margins on account of cost-control measures, rationalising employee pyramid and efficiency improvements. However, this might not be a sign of sharp margin expansion in the near term. Additionally, the weak revenue guidance by Infosys, Wipro, HCL Tech does not inspire much confidence.

IT stocks fall after Q2 results disappoint

Following the subdued quarterly earnings, major IT stocks have seen a fall. While TCS share price has tanked over 5 percent since October 11, Infosys shares have declined around 4 percent since its results on October 12. HCL Technologies share price has remained largely unchanged. Wipro shares tumbled more than 4 percent on October 19, a day after the Bengaluru-based company reported its Q2 earnings.

LTIMindtree, however, gained more than 4 percent on October 19 as the company reported a better-than-expected margin. The EBIT margin was a “positive surprise”, according to brokerages. Despite weak discretionary spending, prevailing uncertainty and anticipated higher-than-usual furloughs in Q3, the management is confident of delivering a better performance in the second half of this fiscal.

""IT companies are expected to face ongoing challenges. The future of IT companies will be heavily influenced by the commentary from the Federal Reserve,"" said Shrikant Chouhan - Head - Equity Research, Kotak Securities. If someone is interested in taking a contrarian position in the IT sector, Infosys appears to be a more favourable option, he added.

Which IT stocks to buy?

After the release of the September quarter results for IT companies, brokerages' opinions remained varied. Infosys received predominantly positive ratings such as ‘Outperform’, ‘Overweight’, or ‘Buy’. However, target prices were cut due to concerns about margin pressures and a less robust revenue outlook.

In the case of TCS, HCL Technologies, and Wipro, brokerages have largely assigned ratings like ‘Hold’, ‘Reduce’, or ‘Equal Weight’ owing to a somewhat pessimistic outlook. In fact, some analysts even issued ‘Sell’ recommendations for Wipro and TCS. LTIMindtree, on the other hand, primarily received favourable recommendations, with ‘Buy’ or ‘Add’ calls from analysts.

The way ahead

The major theme emerging from the IT majors’ Q2 report card is that the macroeconomic conditions remain shaky. Elevated interest rates along with weak consumer sentiment in Western economies have led to a persistent slowdown in discretionary spends, leading to delays in decision-making as well as deal conversions.

Further, the AI theme that every IT major's management has talked about is unlikely to be a short-term game-changer. The positive effects of these efforts are anticipated to significantly influence outcomes in the medium to long term.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on HCL Tech

HCL Tech’s revenue growth of 0.8% QoQ fell short of our estimates, while EBITM expansion of ~150bps was above our expectation. ER&D revenue grew by 5% CC QoQ (organic 1.6%) after two quarters of a sequential decline. It reported new bookings of ~USD4bn in Q2, its highest booking ever, driven by a mega deal (Verizon). Management has slashed FY24 revenue growth guidance to 5-6% CC YoY (earlier 6-8%), citing weak discretionary spending and lowerthan-expected performance in H1. Revised guidance implies revenue CQGR of 4.0-5.3% in H2, which management remains confident of achieving, considering the planned ramp-up in recent large deals (Verizon deal ramp-up w.e.f. November 1, 2023), software business seasonality, ongoing business momentum, and contribution from ASAP. Management has retained EBITM guidance of 18-19% for FY24.



Outlook

We tweak our FY24-26E EPS estimates (less than 1% change), factoring in Q2 performance and FY24 guidance revision. We maintain our BUY rating with a TP of Rs1,360 at 19x Sep-25E EPS.

HCL Technologies reported a mixed Q2FY24 as the firm's revenue growth fell short of most analysts' estimates but EBIT margins were in line with expectations. The decline in revenue was a result of a more pronounced slowdown in demand, due to lower discretionary spending in the IT sector, and reprioritisation of spending to core operations, said analysts.

HCL Tech cut the FY24 revenue growth guidance in constant currency terms to 5-6 percent, maintaining the margin guidance of 18-19 percent, which came largely in line with brokerages’ expectations.

The soft Q1 and Q2 means the required CQGR, even on this reduced guidance, is 2.6-3.8 percent, said Nuvama Institutional Equities, adding, “This is a tall ask, but which management is confident of achieving.”

HCL Tech to accelerate in H2 to catch up first two quarters’ slump

Amid an uncertain environment, the HCL Tech management expects a strong H2. The key focus of investors will be on the company’s ability to deliver a better H2 compared to its peers, who have a muted outlook.

Motilal Oswal expects that the strong revenue growth and continued cost-control measures in the fiscal second half will provide operating leverage to HCL Tech and support the overall margin improvement.

Considering the planned ramp-up in recent large deals, software business seasonality, ongoing business momentum, and contribution from ASAP, the management remains confident.

The EBIT margin is expected to recover to 18.6 percent in FY25 as the company boasts of a strong deal book. As a result, HCL Tech might outperform its fellow IT services players.

Share price outlook

Even on reduced guidance, HCL Tech is likely to be the fastest-growing large-cap in IT Services, said Nuvama. Its decent growth in services and lower exposure to the troubled BFSI segment imply a high probability of stable earnings growth, the brokerage firm added. This will support the share price despite the near-term weakness. A high dividend yield and inexpensive valuation (18.5x FY25E PE) provide a floor to the stock price. Any near-term correction should make it more attractive to investors.

Motilal Oswal and Nuvama both maintained their 'Buy' calls on the IT player, with target prices of Rs 1,410 and Rs 1,400, respectively. Morgan Stanley has maintained its ‘Overweight’ call, while cutting the target price from Rs 1,450 per share to Rs 1,400. In comparison, Nomura has a 'Neutral' call on the company, issuing a target price of Rs 1,200 per share, since the global brokerage believes that the drop in discretionary demand is starting to hurt the company.

It further attributed the optimistic revenue growth forecasts for FY25 to stabilising macro risks, the levelling off hyper-scale revenue growth, announcements of significant deal wins and robust order bookings in the Q2FY24.

The continued impact of cuts in discretionary tech spending is likely to continue to weigh on HCL Tech’s second quarter results. However, it would be offset by a decent software business growth year-on-year and a month's contribution from the ASAP Group acquisition.

HCL Tech’s business mix to help revenue, profit growth

""Revenue growth is expected to experience a sharp recovery after two consecutive quarters of decline. The growth will be supported by the recovery in ERD (Engineering and R&D) services, complemented by the supportive IMS (infrastructure management) service,” said Motilal Oswal in a pre-earning research note.

“HCL Tech is one of the key beneficiaries of the business mix and cloud adoption at scale, given its expertise in ERD and IMS,"" it added.

""We are factoring in robust revenue growth quarter-on-quarter from the ASAP acquisition, which will bolster ER&D services growth (ER&D currently accounts for 15.4% of revenue). ER&D may witness a pickup after a sharp decline of 5.2 percent in Q1,” said Elara Capital in a research note.

“Sequential growth may also be supported by a multi-year managed public cloud services deal with Siemens,” it added.

HCL Tech EBIT margins seen rising in Q2FY24

The mean of earnings before interest tax (EBIT) margin estimates for HCL Tech in July-September quarter stands at 21.4 percent, reflecting a 91 basis points sequential expansion attributed to operational efficiencies. (Note: One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.) In the previous April-June quarter, HCL Tech reported EBIT at 20.5 percent.

Also read: What to expect from IT sector’s Q2 earnings

The quarter-on-quarter margin improvement would be due to wage hike deferral and a higher contribution from the high-margin Products & Platforms segment, said BNP Paribas.

HCL Tech recently announced that the wage hike cycle would be skipped for mid-level and senior employees, while for junior employees, it has been pushed back to the December quarter.

Furthermore, last month, the company unveiled a $2.1 billion deal with Verizon. This net new deal, spanning six years, is expected to start contributing from November 2023. “The Verizon deal worth USD 2.1 billion will come into effect from November,” said Elara Capital.

Key areas to watch include the performance of impacted verticals like ER&D, tech, and telecom; the FY24 revenue and margin outlook; the risk of macroeconomic headwinds on demand and demand outlook; the outlook on services and Products and platforms segments; investments in GenAI partnerships and solutions; and the timeline of large deal win ramp-ups and pipeline.

HCLTech said on August 10 that it has signed a $2.1-billion deal with Verizon Business for providing managed network services to its global enterprise customers. This deal will be a shot in the arm for country's third largest IT services firm, following a sluggish April-June quarter performance. Share prices of the tech giant were up 3.7% at Rs 1176 in early trade on Friday morning.

As of Q1FY24, HCLTech's deal wins stood at $1.56 billion, a significant drop from its $2 billion plus order book in the previous seven quarters.

""We expect this deal to have a positive revenue impact over the next six years beginning in November 2023 with an estimated new total contract value of $2.1 billion over the term,"" HCLTech informed the stock exchanges about the deal.

Under this collaboration, Verizon's networking power, solutioning, and scale will be combined with HCLTech's managed service capabilities to offer large-scale wireline service delivery for enterprise

customers.

Verizon will lead all ""customer acquisition, sales, solutioning, and overall planning and development with its customers"", whereas, HCLTech will lead post-sale implementation and ongoing support, the press release noted.

A select group of Verizon Business Global Customer Operations staff will also transition to HCLTech, to execute the collaboration, which will require tight coordination and balance of responsibilities at enterprise scale.

Vijayakumar said, “Our data-driven service delivery, advanced network capabilities and frictionless customer interfaces combined with the unique strengths and resiliency of the Verizon network will enable enterprises to drive better business outcomes and time to market.""

Interestingly, this deal will fall under the telecom and technology segments, which witnessed major ramp downs in the previous quarter.

Speaking to Moneycontrol last month, Vijayakumar had shared that the company has started building a very strong pipeline from the first quarter itself and the company is seeing an ""all-time high"" order book at present.

""We expect it to be a good booking in this quarter, which I think will help us continue to have better growth sequentially from here on, which leads us to meet the 6-8 percent (CC revenue growth) guidance for the year,"" he added."

Large Indian IT and software services exporters are not betting on fresh recruitments as it is likely to fall by approximately 40 percent on-year in the current financial year, highlighting the subdued demand and slump in technology services that is making tough for the $245-billion industry, a report has said.

IT services majors are likely to roll out offers between 50,000 and 100,000 employees during fiscal 2024, the Economic Times reported, citing data from Bengaluru-based staffing firm Xpheno. This will mark a steep drop from the net hiring of over 250,000 by these companies in the previous year.

India's No.1 software services exporter TCS just added around 500 employees, and the remaining four reported a sharp fall.\

Further, global tech giants such as Accenture, Capgemini and Cognizant, which have a huge base of staff in India, reported a decline in headcount of more than 5,000 each during the most recent quarter.

“It looks like a washout year for IT services hiring. The dismal sentiment is expected to continue, with little or no indication of green shoots in the sector. This, coupled with a lack of visibility on rollout of new projects, is leading to companies withholding fresh mandates for hiring,” Sunil C, chief executive at TeamLease Digital, told the financial daily.

He went on to add that there will be a further 40 percent decline in net recruitment by the sector in the current fiscal because entities are concentrating on increasing employee utilisation metrics.

At present, the requirement for fresh hires is down by nearly 50 percent, as of August, compared to the previous year.

Meanwhile, this website, citing data from Xpheno, reported that there were just 1,400 open roles in India across the Big Tech companies — Facebook (Meta), Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Google (Alphabet) — as of July 2023."

In Q1FY24, HCL Tech Ltd (HCLT) reported revenue of Rs 26,296 Cr, down 1.2% QoQ and below our expectations. The company’s operating profit stood at Rs 4,460 Cr, reporting a de-growth of 7.8% on a QoQ basis. Missing our expectations, the company’s operating margins, too, declined by 110bps to 17%, which was largely led by higher operating expenses and higher onsite expenses during the quarter. Its net profit for Q1FY24 stood at Rs 3,534 Cr, registering a de-growth of 11.3% QoQ.

Outlook

We recommend a HOLD rating on the stock and assign a 17x P/E multiple to its FY25E earnings of Rs 71.9/share to arrive at a TP of Rs 1,200/share, implying an upside of 8% from the CMP.

Net profit for Q1FY24 stood at Rs 3,534 crore, missing analyst estimates of Rs 3,782 crore this quarter.

India’s third largest IT services firm HCLTech on July 12 reported 7.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in net profit in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 ended on June 30, 2023. Sequentially, however, net profit was down by 11.2 percent due to ramp downs in deals and verticals like Hi-tech and telecom.

Net profit for Q1FY24 stood at Rs 3,534 crore, missing analyst estimates of Rs 3,782 crore this quarter.

Consolidated revenue for the quarter grew 12 percent YoY at Rs 26,296 crore as compared to Rs 23,464 crore in Q1FY23.

In constant currency (CC) terms, revenue slipped 1.3 percent Q0Q. Last quarter, HCLTech has reduced its YoY revenue growth guidance in CC terms for FY24, to 6-8 percent compared to 12-14 percent in FY22-23.

EBIT margins or operating margins stood at 16.9 percent in the quarter under review. Earlier the company had given a full-year margin guidance of 18-19 percent for FY24.

Moreover, HCLTech's board of directors declared an interim dividend of Rs 10 per equity share for the financial year 2023-24.

""The record date of July 20, 2023 fixed for the payment of the aforesaid interim dividend has been confirmed by the Board of Directors. The payment date of the said interim dividend shall be August 1, 2023,"" HCL Tech added.

HCLTech also said that it received 18 large deals in the quarter, with total deal wins worth $1.6 billion. The deal pipeline remained at an all-time high, growing 18% sequentially and 26 percent YoY.

The total headcount as of June end was 2,23,438, down by 2,506 sequentially. The company, however, added 1,597 freshers during the quarter.

“In Q1FY24, our revenue and people strength sequentially moderated in line with the demand environment. These large deals helped offset cuts in discretionary spending in these verticals. We are expecting other verticals to pick up as well shortly,” said C Vijayakumar, CEO and MD HCLTech.

Last quarter, Vijayakumar had told Moneycontrol that he is seeing demand for FY24 coming from customers wanting to be more cost efficient, adopting cloud and bringing more automation to their operations.

Further, Roshni Nadar Malhotra Chairperson HCLTech commented, ""HCLTech continues to be a partner of choice for global enterprises and is well placed to leverage opportunities in emerging areas such as Al and allied technologies despite the challenging global macro environment.""

The results seasons in IT services sector begins this week with large cap tech companies such as TCS, HCL Tech, Wipro and Infosys announcing their results. IT stocks have underperformed in the recent rally as analysts expect revenues to be under pressure because of a likely recession in the United States.

Derivatives outlook for IT sector

The IT index has been volatile in the July series, with open interest additions mostly on the bullish side. Some short covering occurred at the start of the series, followed by long additions in recent sessions.

""The major trend for Nifty IT remains consolidative and could only see deviation if the recent base at 28,300 gets breached. On the upside, its immediate resistance zone still holds at 31,200,"" stated Sacchitanand Uttekar, Vice President-Research & Data Analysis at Tradebulls Securities. He believes that TCS, Infosys, and Wipro, have been oscillating lower and have yet to experience a major reversal on the upside.

Arun Kumar Mantri, Founder of Mantri FinMart, believes that among the stocks in the benchmark index, Infosys and Tech Mahindra are expected to outperform, followed by mid-cap IT counters such as Coforge and Mphasis. He further stated that most of the negatives are already priced in, and the downside seems to be capped in the near term unless any major negative developments occur on the earnings front. HCL Tech has witnessed massive short additions, and any positive surprise may trigger short covering in the stock.

According to Santosh Pasi, derivatives trader and analyst, ""Considering CNX IT, it is looking sideways to a bullish outlook based on the weekly timeframe.""

Expected positions, target support and resistance levels ahead of earnings results

Tata Consultancy Services

“Based on the chart analysis, TCS is showing a sideways trend and is most likely to continue. For TCS, we are expecting it sideways between 3.200 and 3.400. We will prefer to go for non-directional strategies like Short Iron Condo,"" according to Santosh Pasi

As per Arun Mantri, “TCS is exactly placed in the mid of the trading band with very lighter positions in the July series. The counter may undergo range expansion in the near term after the recent consolidation and muted price action. The key support is placed around 3,190 and 3,150 while resistance is around 3,320 and 3,380 levels.”

HCL Tech

HCL Tech is currently around the cluster of major short-term moving averages and has witnessed significant short additions in the last few sessions, with heavy call writing in the at-the-money call options. The counter has support around the 1,070-1,080 area, while resistance is in the 1,160-1,200 range. Any positive development may trigger a short squeeze in the counter, and traders should maintain a clear focus, according to the founder of Mantri FinMart.

Meanwhile, Santosh Pasi expects sideways to bullish momentum for HCL Tech, with support at 1,100 and resistance around 1,200 levels

Wipro

According to analysts, Wipro is an under-owned counter in the derivative space and may witness some sparks if the stock decisively crosses the 400 mark. Historically, in the last two quarters, the stock has provided positive returns in the range of 2-3 percent post-earnings. The support for the stock is around 380, while resistance is at 415-425 levels. Analysts expect the stock to remain between 370 and 410.

Infosys

For Infosys, analysts expect a bullish trend and anticipate it to reach a target price of Rs 1,400. The results for the counter are due in the middle of the next week, and its support levels are placed at 1,320 and 1,295, while resistance is around 1,370 and 1,420 marks.

Option Trading Strategy Recommendation

A short iron condor spread is a four leg strategy wherein, the investor sells one call while buying another call with a higher strike and sells one put while buying another put with a lower strike. Typically, the call strikes are above and the put strikes below the current level of underlying stock, and the distance between the call strikes equals the distance between the put strikes. All the options must be of the same expiration.

The Broken Wing Condor Spread is simply a condor Spread which has risk inclined to one side.

The protective put strategy is a hedging strategy used to protect an existing long position in the market. In a protective put the holder of a security buys a put option to protect himself against a drop in price.

Technology stocks took a beating on June 23 with analysts being a bundle of nerves after Accenture trimmed the upper end of its revenue guidance for FY23. The IT giant's hints at demand taking a hit also left the market on the edge.

At 11:40am, the Nifty IT index was down 0.7 percent with stocks such as Tech Mahindra, Infosys, Mpahsis, and Tata Consultancy Services shedding around a percent.

“Generating returns in India-listed companies, after a sharp stock price rally post-4QFY23 results, will be a challenge,” said Kotak Institutional Equities, which believes Infosys looks attractive followed by HCL Technologies.

Accenture Results

Accenture reported a revenue of $16.56 billion, up over 5 percent on-year in constant currency terms. Despite good growth in Q3, the IT major has lowered the upper end of its FY23 revenue growth guidance band to 8-9 percent YoY in constant currency terms from 8-10 percent earlier.

The company has guided for a 2-6 percent YoY growth for Q4 in constant currency terms, implying a sequential decline of 4.9 percent to 1.3 percent.

At the lower end of the guidance, the company expects further deterioration in small-sized deal sales, CMT as well as North America. This, according to analysts, is negative as there was an expectation that there would be some stabilisation in stressed verticals from June.

The management highlighted the impact on the demand environment from adverse macro fundamentals, delays in small and discretionary deals, and a dip in deal pricing in few segments, all of which hint at a drag on near-term growth for the sector.

Deal booking remained soft at $17.3 billion, up 4 percent YoY in constant currency terms and 1 percent YoY in US dollar terms.

What analysts are reading?

Analysts expect a negative near-term impact for the Indian IT players.

Nomura said guidance revision indicates a moderation in demand. It has retained its cautious stance on the sector. “We remain concerned on the demand outlook for the Indian IT services and expect approximately 480 basis points slower revenue growth (at 6.1 percent YoY) in FY24 vs FY23 for large-caps,” it said.

A soft first half is anticipated for the Indian IT players, said JM Financial Institutional Services. Given that Accenture’s outlook is only till August, it offers little incremental read-through for the Indian IT. However, a potential deterioration in smaller discretionary projects, CMT vertical and North America suggest that demand has not bottomed, the brokerage firm cautioned.

JM Financial Institutional Services highlighted that weakness in discretionary - CMT and North America - has a negative implication for players with higher exposure to these segments, especially LTIMindtree, Persistent Systems and Tech Mahindra. Plus, higher exposure to discretionary also puts Infosys at risk.

Morgan Stanley noted that Accenture's Q3 earnings showed lower order intake. The brokerage firm has maintained its cautious stance for the Indian technology players in the first half of FY24. It added that a commentary around dampening in small projects has brought to the fore concerns about slowdown in the sector.

Jefferies also noted that discretionary IT spends were still under pressure and that Q1 is softer than expected. It pointed out that the recent channel checks and interactions with companies point to a worsening demand outlook.

Rising risks to demand recovery in the second half of FY24 could lead to further de-rating, Jefferies said while cutting its growth estimates for FY24 by 50-150 basis points.

JPMorgan said Accenture cutting guidance for FY23 and Q4 hinted at a tough macro environment. The foreign brokerage firm added that the guidance implies no growth recovery by the year-end, leading to a weak Q2 for the Indian IT.

JPMorgan said weakness in the US is a negative for all Indian technology companies. While it has remained negative on the entire sector, a weakness in CMT is negative for Tech Mahindra, LTIMindtree and Persistent Systems.

Bucking the larger view

Nuvama Institutional Equities said Accenture’s Q3FY23 results bode well for the Indian IT services companies, given strong growth and bookings in the outsourcing business.

The domestic brokerage firm has maintained its positive stance on the sector, and expects a sustainable strong demand environment to drive strong earnings growth over the next three years.

How ICICI Securities read the trimming of guidance was that since September 2022 when the IT major issued FY23 guidance, the mid-point of guidance has been lowered by only 50 basis points over the last 10 months, despite deteriorating macros such as persistent high inflation, banking crisis in March 2023 among others, which means technology demand remains resilient.

Large deal momentum continues to be strong with 26 large deal wins for the company in April 2023 quarter. On a year-to-date basis, Accenture has won 85 large deals, 11 more than last year, the brokerage firm pointed out.

Amid a slew of reports observing a muted quarter for IT stocks, Morgan Stanley on Thursday took a cautious stance on Tier-1 and Tier-2 Indian tech majors. The US-based broking firm has downgraded Cyient to equal-weight and also warned of Tech Mahindra, TCS and Mphasis being exposed to greater risks.

The share price of Cyient Ltd, which rallied over 80 percent on the NSE in the past six months, is capped at Rs 1,500 by the broking firm.

It is important to note that JP Morgan too in its recent report on the IT Services industry had placed TCS and Mphasis on the negative catalyst watchlist. However, while JP Morgan expects every IT firm to disappoint the Street in the 2HY24, Morgan Stanley has given mixed signals by stating that it continues to maintain preference for large-cap IT companies such as Infosys, HCLTech and LTIMindtree.

Read: Cyient DLM sets price band at Rs 250-265 for IPO lined up for June 27

The broking firm, in support of its selective stance, while assessing risk vulnerability of the large cap ITs, has cited ‘relative valuation support’ or a strong order book, which is supposed to make up for the moderated growth forecast.

For instance, according to SBI Securities, the numbers for HCL Tech in FY23 were ahead of the Street estimates as it reported a 9 percent on-year rise in its operational revenue. On the other hand, Tech Mahindra, which the broking firm sees exposed to greater risk, had reported a 7 percent decline in the operational revenue along with a reduced PAT of Rs 1,125 crore in FY23 against Rs 1,545 crore reported in FY22.

Morgan Stanley sees a potential for a cyclical pick-up in the IT sector only in the second half of either FY24 or FY25.

Small may not always be beautiful, but it certainly merits a second look, at least in the IT space. With the Indian IT sector buffeted by global macro headwinds, analysts are of the view that one of the best bets to ride out the storm would be the smaller IT firms, which are projected to sustain their growth premium over the tier-1 pack.

The domestic IT industry largely delivered a disappointing Q4 show amid the gathering clouds of recession in the West and the banking crisis in the US – the bread-and-butter market for India’s software service exporters.

“The macro challenges are manifesting into a set of outcomes for the sector ranging from cuts in discretionary spending, delay in decision making (slower conversion from pipeline to total contract value or TCV), slower deal ramp-up, to change in the propensity for price increases/volume discounts,” HDFC Securities said in a recent report.

However, the deteriorating operative environment and soured sentiment are bigger worries for frontline IT companies.

“India tier-1 IT has a high correlation to S&P500 revenue growth, which includes large customers across verticals and the growth rate is expected to decelerate over the next two quarters,” analysts at HDFC Securities added.

Of course, there are gradations of pain within the tier-1 pack.

HDFC Securities believes Tech Mahindra and Infosys have a higher risk from large clients moderating spend, and TCS scores above Infosys both in BFSI and non-BFSI industry verticals.

“Mid-tier IT on average scores slightly above tier-1 IT, supported by ER&D companies,” it said. “Mid-tier IT growth premium is expected to continue—both on revenue growth and profit growth in FY24E, supported by vertical and enterprise-specific drivers.”

Growth Drivers

A key driver is the engineering R&D (ER&D) segment within the manufacturing vertical.

Interestingly, the manufacturing vertical (including industrials and automotive) had the highest count of enterprises increasing their outlook and beating the estimates this earnings season.

In a recent note on L&T Technology Services (LTTS), Motilal Oswal too highlighted the contribution of this segment.

“We continue to view LTTS as a beneficiary of the growing penetration of ER&D services,” it noted, adding that digitization is driving the accelerated spends in ER&D.

Stating that ER&D pureplay guidance for FY24E is a strong growth premium over tier-1 IT, HDFC Securities said Cyient, Tata Elxsi and L&T Technology Services are expected to grow above the low-teens for FY24E as compared to mid-single-digit growth expected for tier-1 IT firms.

In a recent report, Kotak Institutional Equities too said it expects mid-tier companies with strong domain understanding and capabilities to beat tier-1 companies in terms of growth.

“Quality mid-tier [companies] can deliver double-digit growth in FY2024. Portfolio mix that is tuned to growth with lower legacy drag, quality management team and strong sales focus are aiding healthy growth even in a less friendly environment,” the brokerage said.

However, it added that tier-1 companies that offer a full suite of services are most likely to weather the slowdown.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on HCL Tech

HCLT delivered a tad weaker-than-expected operating performance in Q4FY23 due to weak discretionary spending. Revenue declined 1.2% CC QoQ, impacted by seasonality in Software (-14.6% CC QoQ) and decline in ER&D (-3.8%). Services revenue grew by 0.6% CC QoQ in Q4, led by Financial Services (6.9%), HLS (3.6%) and Retail and CPG (0.6%), while Telecom (-5.6%), Manufacturing (-3.5%) and Technology (-1.6%) remained weak. Net new deal intake remained healthy at USD2.07bn in Q4, led by operating model transformation, cloud adoption and vendor-consolidation deals across Financial Services, Manufacturing and HLS. HCLT has guided 6-8% CC revenue growth for FY24 (implied CQGR of 1.4-2.1% over Q1-Q4) and EBITM of 18-19%. Management has guided for 6.5-8.5% growth in Services business in FY24, implying 1.4-2.2% CQGR over the next four quarters. It observed project cancellations and delays in decision-making/ramp-ups in discretionary spending, while RTB spending has not seen much stress.

Outlook

HCLT is well-positioned to weather the storm, given its comprehensive service offerings and well-balanced portfolio across RTB and discretionary spends. We have cut our earnings estimates by 1.9-2.8% for FY24E/25E, factoring in Q4 miss and higher ETR. We maintain our BUY rating with a TP of Rs1,150/share at 17x Mar-25E EPS (earlier 1,160).

The March quarter earnings season has got off to a rocky start for investors, with IT majors posting a sobering set of numbers amid the gathering clouds of recession in the West, even as banking and financial firms put up a robust show thanks to resilient domestic demand.

The week began on an inauspicious note for Dalal Street after its nine-day rally juddered to a halt due to severe selling in the IT pack, led by Infosys.

The Infosys stock suffered ‘a rapid unscheduled disassembly’ (to borrow SpaceX’s terminology) on April 17 after the company’s dismal performance in the March quarter stunned investors.

The company was whiplashed by project cancellations, margin contraction and slowing order inflows triggered by the banking crisis in the US – the bread-and-butter market for India’s software services industry.

More worryingly, the Bengaluru-headquartered firm guided for revenue growth of just 4-7 per cent in 2023-24 (in constant currency terms). For context, its earlier guidance stood at 13-15 percent (for FY23) and 12-14 percent (FY22).

A few days earlier, India's biggest IT firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) too had disappointed the street with lower-than-expected numbers for the last quarter of FY23, leading to a barrage of target price cuts by brokerages.

“The outlook for TCS has been clouded by client caution driving cuts to discretionary tech spends,” JPMorgan noted.

In contrast, it is the smaller IT firms which have propped up morale with upbeat numbers.

HCL Technologies’ profit at Rs 3,981 crore beat estimates, even though revenue lagged behind the projections. (Read full story here).

“Although the outlook for FY24 is uncertain in the near term owing to the challenging macro environment, the resilient model, diverse portfolio mix, strong client additions, a strong deal pipeline and decent hiring makes HCL Tech well placed to navigate the uncertainty,” Sharekhan said.



Cyient too logged a healthy 48 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in consolidated revenue at Rs 1,751 crore, while net profit rose 5.5 percent to Rs 163 crore.

But there’s some grim news for investors ahead of the remaining IT results.

JPMorgan says the fourth quarter results of TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech highlight the weakness in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and telecom verticals.

""We see Tech Mahindra and Mphasis get impacted, given their high exposure to both of these verticals,"" the broking firm wrote in a research note.

The commentary from the US too remains unsettling, with everyone from Warren Buffett to Nouriel Roubini and Jeremy Grantham recently cautioning investors that the US banking crisis is far from over.

There’s no stop loss on pain, after all.

BFSI Booster

Three things are certain in life – death, taxes, and HDFC Bank delivering around 20 percent growth in profits.

The country’s largest private-sector lender on April 15 reported a 20.6 percent growth in net profit at Rs 12,594.5 crore for the quarter ended March, while consolidated net revenue jumped by a similar margin to Rs 34,552.8 crore. (Full numbers here).

It performed well on most parameters – deposit growth, asset quality and capital adequacy – though the stock has not budged this week, maybe due to the overhang of the HDFC merger.

Analysts, however, remain bullish on the counter.

Most banks, in fact, had posted encouraging Q4 business updates, and the street is eyeing a good batch of earnings from this segment.

From the insurance pack, ICICI Prudential Life posted stellar figures, including a 27.2 percent jump in net income to Rs 235 crore for the March quarter on nearly record margins earned from new policies sold.

Brokerage CLSA said the strong fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2023 was supported by a pre-buying trend related to budget tax changes in March 2023, leading to a 27 percent increase in annualized premium equivalent (APE) and a consistently high margin of 32 percent.

In other news….

As if the challenging macro environment wasn’t enough, equity market participants were jolted by a news report, which claimed the government was mulling increases in capital gains taxes for top-income earners.

The Income Tax Department issued a swift rebuttal to calm nerves, but some investors still remain on the edge.

The underlying sense of bearishness was evident when Avalon Technologies sank nearly 9 percent on its market debut on April 18.

Mankind Pharma too managed to attract only a single-digit premium in the grey market on the day of its IPO price band announcement, demonstrating that the glory days of ‘irrational exuberance’ are behind us as of now.

Analysts have also flagged the expensive valuations and only offer-for-sale portion in the IPO as possible reasons for the low premium.

On the other hand, ITC woke up from its interminable slumber and how! The stock hit the Rs 400 milestone this week, catapulting the cigarettes-to-FMCG conglomerate to the elite club of Rs 5 trillion market capitalisation firms.

On April 20, ITC became the 11th listed Indian company to cross Rs 5 trillion market capitalisation after its shares touched a record high with a 21 percent surge so far this year.

ITC @ 400: A story of patience, payback, and a puff of smoke

Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services, HDFC Bank, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Life Insurance Corp of India, State Bank of India, HDFC and Bharti Airtel have earlier achieved this milestone.

ITC on April 21 briefly pipped even HDFC Ltd in terms of value, spreading more cheer among its faithful band of investors.

Let’s hope the results keep up the momentum."

Its revenue from operations for the quarter stood at Rs 26,606 crore, clocking a growth of 17.74 percent from Rs 22,597 crore, the company said in an exchange filing.

The profit figure beat estimates but revenue lagged the projections.

According to a poll of brokerages, HCLTech was expected to report a consolidated revenue of Rs 26,801 crore, up 18.6 percent on-year, while consolidated profit after tax (PAT) was projected to rise by 8.5 percent to Rs 3,898 crore. On a constant currency (CC) basis, the company was expected to report a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) decline in the range of 1-2 percent.

Constant currency revenue was down 1.2 percent QoQ and up 10.5 percent year on year (YoY). US dollar revenue came in at $3,235 million, up 8.1 percent YoY. EBIT of the company was at Rs 4836 crore, which was 18 percent of revenue.

“Our pipeline is near all-time high, which reflects our differentiated business mix and strong client demand for our offerings. We have added 3,674 employees this quarter and overall employee strength has now grown beyond 225000. All these set us well in FY24 for a healthy revenue growth in 6-8 percent range with operating margins in 18-19 percent range,” said C Vijay Kumar, CEO & MD, HCLTech.

The Board of Directors also declared an interim dividend of Rs 18 per equity share for the FY24. The record date of April 28, 2023 is fixed for the payment of the aforesaid interim dividend. The payment date shall be May 9, 2023.

Indian multinational IT services company HCL Technologies (HCL Tech) is scheduled to announce its January-March earnings on April 20, with analysts expecting consolidated revenue to remain flat, and net profit to decline by 4.8 percent on a sequential basis.

According to a poll of brokerages, HCL Tech may report consolidated revenue of Rs 26,801 crore, up 18.6 percent year-on-year (YoY), while consolidated profit after tax (PAT) is projected to rise by 8.5 percent YoY to Rs 3,898 crore. On constant currency (CC) basis, the company is expected to report a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) decline in the range of 1-2 percent.

The aftermath of the US banking crisis is being felt by Indian IT services firms, which have a sizable exposure to the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment and derive a major part of their revenues from this sector, particularly from the US and European markets. Kotak Institutional Equities has pegged HCL Tech’s exposure to the banking and financial services sector, excluding insurance, at 14 percent.

Recently, TCS reported a CC revenue growth of 0.6 percent QoQ, the lowest in 11 quarters, while Infosys’ revenue declined 3.2 percent QoQ.

“For Q4FY23E, we expect HCL results to be the weakest in our coverage universe in terms of CC QoQ growth at just -1.9 percent due to weak seasonality in the products & platforms (P&P) business,” said analysts at ICICI Securities.

According to brokerage firm Motilal Oswal, HCL Tech’s software business is expected to witness a decline of 22 percent QoQ, while the service segment is projected to grow by 3.6 percent QoQ.

“We expect services / engineering, research and development (ER&D) / P&P growth of 3 percent / 3.5 percent / -21 percent QoQ in USD terms. We expect P&P revenues to decline by 4 percent YoY due to termination of HCL Tech’s DXC partnership in FY22,” according to JM Financial.

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is expected to reach Rs 4,962 crore, up 22 percent YoY, according to the brokerage poll. EBIT margin may expand to 0.5 percent on a yearly basis, but might contract by 1.1 percent QoQ.

“We expect EBIT margin to decline by 130 basis points (bps) QoQ due to decline in higher margin product revenue even while services will show an improvement in margins driven by improvement in utilisation,” says Asian Market Securities. It also expects HCL Tech to guide for 5-7 percent revenue growth in CC for FY24E and a margin guidance of 18-20 percent.

Investors will be watching out for HCL’s commentary on tech spending outlook, specifically in the BFSI segment, macro demand environment, deal pipeline, and large deal activity, as well as its outlook on product and ER&D businesses, given the turmoil in Europe. Margin outlook and attrition trends are the other aspects to watch out for.

Nifty IT index on Thursday witnessed a 2 percent slump after Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) earnings for Q4FY23 missed expectations of the Street traded down 2 percent.

Despite a 14.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 11,392 crore and a 16.9 percent growth in revenue to Rs 59,162 crore, TCS missed estimates, with quarterly growth at 1.6 percent for revenue and 5.0 percent for net profit. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin contracted 0.5 percent to 24.5 percent.

While analysts predicted subdued growth in a seasonally weak quarter, the recent US banking crisis has resulted in estimate cuts by analysts and increased caution among investors.

“Q4 missed across board from unexpected weakness in US and continued Challenges in Europe,” said JPMorgan who have given TCS an ‘underweight’ rating and a target price of Rs 2,700, implying a downside of around 17 percent.

Indian IT companies that rely heavily on revenue from the BFSI sector, particularly from the US and Europe, are facing significant setbacks due to the banking crisis resulting from the collapse of SVB and the subsequent takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS.

As clients in these markets face liquidity concerns, IT firms are expected to see decreased technology spending budgets and delayed decision-making, leading to project deferrals.

While TCS recorded an order book value of $10 billion this quarter, Morgan Stanley, with an 'equal-weight' rating and a target price of Rs 3,350, says clarity is limited on whether sentiment has troughed despite the strong order book.

The rest of the IT pack is also expected to largely follow a similar trend and either report flat or negative growth for Q4FY23.

Infosys, India's second-largest IT firm, which will be announcing its Q4FY23 earnings on April 13, is expected to see muted growth in its Q4FY23 results, with slight margin expansion. According to a poll of brokerages, quarterly growth for revenue and PAT is expected to come in at 1.4 percent and 0.6 percent. Infosys was trailing by 2.11 percent at 11.09am.

Kotak Institutional Equities has identified TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies, Mphasis, and LTIMindtree as among the Indian IT firms with exposure to some of the ailing banks.

As per the brokerage, the BFS exposure, excluding insurance, for TCS stands at 29 percent, Infosys at 26 percent, Wipro at 27 percent, HCLT at 14 percent, and TechM at 12 percent.

HCL technologies traded 1 percent lower on Wednesday after foreign brokerage firm JPMorgan placed it on its negative catalyst watch ahead of the Q4FY23 earnings likely to be released on April 20.

The brokerage has cited high, near-term risks for the company and expects it to negatively surprise analysts. The brokerage remains cautious on the overall IT sector and sees downside risks to earnings and multiples from the weak fourth quarter prints and FY24 guidance.

“For Q4FY23, we expect HCL results to be the weakest in our coverage universe in terms of CC QoQ growth at just -1.9 percent due to weak seasonality at product and platform business,” says ICICI Securities which has a ‘hold’ rating on the company.

Stock broking firm Asian Market Securities also expects HCL Tech to show the weakest growth at 1.6 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) decline in constant currency (CC) terms among its large-cap universe and also sees margin contraction of 130 bps QoQ due to steep decline in the higher margin P&P revenues.

It also prefers HCL Tech as one of the large-cap stocks under its coverage and believes it to be attractively priced at the current valuations of 16xFY25.

In Q3FY23, the company reported a 20 percent YoY growth in revenue at Rs 26,700 crore, sequentially it was up 8.2 percent. In CC terms, growth came at 5 percent QoQ and 13.1 percent YoY in Q3FY23. The company’s consolidated net profit stood at Rs 4,096 crore in Q3FY23, up by 19 percent YoY and 17 percent QoQ.

The recent banking crisis in the United States is expected to have an impact on the earnings of Indian information technology (IT) services companies in Q4FY23, with analysts pointing to weak sequential revenue growth. Despite prompt intervention by central banks, which appears to have contained the banking crisis for now, the risk of further disruption remains.

The banking crisis in the US played out from the beginning of March this year, when Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a lender to tech companies, especially start-ups, faced a run on its deposits and ultimately went under. Another US bank, Signature Bank, followed. A third bank, First Republic Bank, was given support. The biggest casualty was Switzerland’s Credit Suisse, which was taken over by UBS through a government-backed action.

Given Indian IT companies' heavy dependence on Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) sector for their revenue, IT related spending cuts and extended decision-making cycles implemented by clients in this segment are likely to impact the companies' top line.

Weak revenue growth

According to analysts at JM Financial, the immediate impact on IT services seems to be more on the elongated decision cycles than actual spending cuts. ""Recent ructions in the global banking space mean new project starts and the usual year-end flurry of deal closures might have been pushed out,"" they note. It believes that firms may land in the lower half of their guided Q4 band and assume their large-cap coverage universe (top-6) to report negative 0.6 percent to 1.2 percent constant currency (CC) quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) revenue growth.

ICICI Securities also warns that while deal pipelines have not shrunk, conversion to new deal wins is taking longer. In some cases, the conversion of order book to revenues in terms of deal ramp-ups is also taking longer than usual.

“This, in our view, implies right shifting/postponement of demand to H2FY24E or even FY25E as the digitalisation agenda of clients remains largely intact, but their near-term focus has shifted to cost optimisation and increasing efficiency,” it said, and expects revenue growth in the range of negative 1.9 percent (HCLT) to 0.5 percent (LTIM) in CC terms.

Higher BFSI exposure companies such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro, LTIMindtree, Coforge and Mphasis will need to be closely monitored to understand the impact of the banking crisis on their revenues, going forward, according to Asian Market Securities (Amsec). The adverse impact of IT-related spending cuts should primarily be on discretionary spends, it says, and believes that cost optimisation and vendor consolidation-related spends should remain the prime focus over the next three to four quarters. It projects large companies to report revenue growth in the narrow range of negative 1.6 percent to 1.1 percent QoQ in CC terms, and mid-tier companies to have a wider growth band in the range of negative 5 percent to 5 percent QoQ in CC.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal predicts its IT services coverage universe to deliver a median revenue growth of 0.8 percent QoQ and 9.2 percent YoY in CC terms in Q4FY23. Apart from BFSI, Hi-Tech, Manufacturing and Retail may also report muted growth in Q4, it added.

Margin relief

While a weak macro is expected to impact Q4FY23 revenue growth, margins can see some improvement on the back of easing supply pressure, cooling off attrition, and improvements in utilisation, according to the brokerage.

“Tier-I companies should post flat margins, with HCLT (down 150 bpd QoQ on P&P (products and platforms) seasonality) and LTIM (up 180 bps QoQ due to recovery from Q3 low base) being the exceptions. The Tier-II pack will post a wider range of flat to 200 bps QoQ, led by Coforge/Zent with margin improvement of 200 bps/120 bps QoQ,” it said.

JM Financial sees slower growth and falling attrition to limit the efficacy of traditional margin levers and projects a muted margin performance ((80)-20 bps QoQ) for the top 5 players.

“TCS is likely to miss its FY23 exit margin target of 25% while TechM’s margin recovery will likely get pushed out further. LTIMindtree’s Q4 margins, +150 bps, will benefit from lack of one-off merger-related cost, but will still be significantly below normalised levels. Coforge should report the highest margin expansion in our coverage universe (+170 bps; adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)) as it pulls up operating levers to achieve its FY23 margin guidance,” it said.

Amsec, on the other hand, expects margins to benefit from easing of supply side pressure and improved utilisation rates. They believe that the difference between margins of mid-tier and large-tier companies will now blur as favourable supply side dynamics will have an almost equal positive flow-through across companies.

Tier-1 vs Tier-2

Cost take-out and vendor consolidation deals are witnessing increase where we believe Tier-1 companies are better positioned to gain market share versus Tier-II companies, it added. The stock broking firm prefers Infosys, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra in large-cap players.

“We expect Infosys to continue to deliver top robust revenue growth, amid strong deal wins and market share gains, the difference in growth vs TCS narrowing though. At the current valuations of 16xFY25E, we believe HCL Tech is attractively priced. TechM is also trading at attractive valuations of 13.6xFY25E EPS, with expectations of upside risks to FY25E numbers with the new CEO bringing in some positive changes.” In Tier-2, it prefers Cyient, Firstsource and Birlasoft due to their high earnings growth trajectory and comfort on valuations.

Motilal Oswal also prefers Tier-I players over Tier-II counterparts, given the former’s attractive valuations, increased traction in vendor consolidation and diversified client portfolios.

Among Tier-I players, it prefers HCL Tech, and Infosys along with TCS. “TCS remains best positioned to benefit from long-term structural tailwinds in tech services and should see a relative pick-up in growth, aided by clients’ focus on cost optimisation and efficiencies. HCLT is one of the key beneficiaries of Cloud adoption at scale, given its expertise in IMS. We expect Infosys to deliver a strong growth, backed by strong deal wins.” In Tier-2, the brokerage leans towards Cyient and Zensar Technologies.

Brokerage firm ICICI Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on TCS, Infosys and LTIM in large-cap, and Mphasis amongst mid-cap players.

Information Technology (IT) services firm Accenture, which follows a September-August financial year, on Thursday reported that revenue grew 9 percent in local or Constant Currency terms to $15.8 billion in the second quarter of FY 23.

Accenture’s revenue was better than the $15.2-15.75 billion it had guided for.

Industry-wise, the highest growth was posted by the resources segment, which grew 16 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) to $2.2 billion followed by health and public services which expanded 15 percent to $3.0 billion.

Financial services and products segments increased by 10 and 9 percent on a yearly basis to $3.0 billion and $4.7 billion respectively. Communications, Media and Tech segments remained flat at $2.9 billion.

Geographically, North America grew 5 percent YoY to $7.4 billion, Europe 12 percent YoY to $5.3 billion, and growth markets the highest at 13 percent YoY to $3.1 billion.

Positives outnumber negatives

The slowdown in North America, and the hi-tech and communications verticals were a negative, but the results had more positives than negatives for Indian IT vendors, said investment manager Morgan Stanley.

Morgan Stanley says the company’s results could generate positive sentiment. Any weakness around its Q4 results and FY 24 guidance should be used as a buying opportunity, it added. The firm prefers LTIMindtree, Infosys and HCL Technologies among large-cap IT firms.

Accenture also reported record new bookings at $22.1 billion, a rise of 17 percent YoY, driven by managed services, which stood at $11.4 billion, while consulting bookings stood at $10.7 billion for the quarter.

“Managed Services bookings held up well and grew by 37% YoY cc (constant currency), while consulting bookings were up 2% YoY cc, reflecting continued emphasis on cost optimization projects vs. growth projects. Management remained positive around technology spends and indicated a strong deal pipeline for 3QFY23, especially in managed services,” financial services firm Jefferies said.

Caution among clients

Management has highlighted caution among clients with delays in decision-making, particularly on consulting, and a slowdown in smaller deals, it added.

CLSA believes strength in the company’s order bookings should give comfort to investors and healthy managed services revenues/bookings was a positive read-through. Comfort should come, given supportive valuations after the recent correction, it added. It remains cautious on the IT sector and only rates Infosys a ‘buy.’

Given the worsening global macroeconomic outlook, Accenture has lowered its annual revenue and profit projections and now expects annual revenue growth to be around 8-10 percent (with -4.5 percent forex impact) YoY in local currency or constant currency, compared with 8-11 percent (with -5.0 percent forex impact) expected previously.

“The guidance implies a belief in the soft landing narrative with pain largely behind us while we believe that pain from the rapid rate tightening that has happened in the Developed Markets (DM) as well as the recent banking turmoil in US/Europe is only ahead of us,” according to Nirmal Bang Securities.

Nirmal Bang is not sure whether the new guidance is pointing to a sustained recovery beyond FY 23 and whether that would be smooth. The firm has an ‘underweight’ stance on the IT Sector and believes consensus is underestimating growth and margin risks in FY 24/FY 25.

Key takeaways

The company also announced 19,000 layoffs globally, of which 7,000 employees are based in India.

“We have three key takeaways for Indian IT firms from Accenture's 2Q results: 1) Rising caution among clients with focus on cost optimization suggests a moderation in growth in FY 24. This is evident from Accenture's implied 2HFY23 revenue growth guidance of 4-8% YoY cc. 2) Increasing client focus on larger deals and slowdown in smaller deals position larger IT firms more favorably than mid/small sized firms; 3) A cooling off of the job market, lower attrition and more prudent hiring are likely to support margins,” Jefferies commented.

Demand continues to shift towards cost optimisation, says Nomura, retaining its cautious stance on the sector and cutting the top end of its FY 23 revenue estimates and Constant Currency growth guidance. It expects operating performance to vary significantly across companies in FY 24. It prefers large-cap over mid-cap IT companies, with its top Picks being Infosys and Tech Mahindra in the former and Coforge and Persistent in the latter.

At 10.31 a.m., the Nifty IT index was up 0.8 percent at 28,224.25 points with LTIM and TCS trading the highest, up 1.7 percent and 1.2 percent, at Rs 4,680.00 and Rs 3,163.50 respectively.

He said that HCL Group's semiconductor wafer fab can be built in about 18-24 months time from the date the government approves its application.

""We are ready with funds. Just to be clear, again, it is happening from HCL Corporate. From my perspective, which is HCL Tech, we are interested in developing capabilities in that space and we see that as a very big opportunity,"" he said.

HCL Group is planning to set up a chip wafer fabrication unit for 65 nanometre nodes that are used in automobile, consumer durables and low-cost devices segment.

HCL Technologies currently works with semiconductor players like Intel, NXP, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC, and Applied Materials in the electronic chip production.

Saithu said that HCL's semiconductor plant will help HCL Technologies to complete its end-to-end offering in electronic production.

""Right now in some of these activities, we are using partners. Whether it is a Global Foundry or TSMC, we are a partner. With this investment, we expect to be able to provide end-to-end service with HCL corporate as a partner. In a sense, you can say it is moving up the value chain but it is more and more of completing the offerings. So that fabless semiconductor company, who do not want to be dealing with multiple partners, they can come to us,"" Saithu said.

He said that the demand for HCL Tech semiconductor services has increased globally and the company has started building capabilities in Brazil, Vietnam, Israil, the Netherlands and Japan while it continues to grow manpower in its Bengaluru office.

""We are trying to increase the size of the pool available, rather than the same people going from one place to another. We have also established a very large scale training programme with multiple customers involved in different skill sets within this industry,"" Saithu said."

An incriminating report by a short-seller, withdrawal of a massive follow-on public offering, followed by Rs 10-lakh-crore market capitalisation wipeout—none of this has been able shake analysts’ confidence in Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone.

It has 21 buy calls and zero sell or hold calls, indicating 100 percent optimism on Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for February.

For Q3, Adani Ports reported a 16.04 percent fall in consolidated net profit to Rs 1315.54 crore, but it was in line with analysts’ estimates. Goldman Sachs maintained its buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 840. Since the publication of the Hindenburg Research report, the stock’s valuation has also tumbled from a trailing twelve months (TTM) price-to-earnings ratio of 33.9 times to 29.5 times.

“Its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) guidance of Rs 14,500 crore for FY24 suggests healthy low-teens/high-teens organic/overall YoY (year-on-year) growth and a healthy quantum of deleveraging to 2.5X net debt to EBITDA,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report.

Next in the Maximum Optimism list is Hindalco. Both Hindalco and its subsidiary Novelis reported a weak set of numbers for Q3, with net profit declining 63 percent and 95 percent, respectively. Yet all 24 analysts covering Hindalco have buy calls on the stock. The bullishness is largely on the back of China reopening and inexpensive valuations.

According to foreign broking firm CLSA, “New pricing clauses and softening costs should lead to a gradual recovery. We see profitability returning to steady state guidance only in the second half of FY24. Strong free cash flow generation and phased capex augur well for leverage.”

On the flipside, JSW Steel has topped the Maximum Pessimism list with 19 sell calls, 7 hold and only 6 buy calls. Analysts have tagged the stock as an ‘expensive’ buy with high net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times.

Still bullish on financials

Financial names like State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank continued to remain in the Maximum Optimism list with 49 buy calls, 51 buy calls and 48 buy calls, respectively. They were among the top names in January too, as well as in the entire calendar year 2022.

While banks struggle to find deposits to keep up with the pace of loan growth, analysts are not too perturbed by the risk of net interest margin contraction.

“Banking stocks trade well below their decade's peaks and even below their 10-year average PBx (price to book ratio) for some. The subdued valuations, despite strong operating metrics in Q3, make the risk-reward picture for Indian banks rather compelling,” noted research firm Bernstein.

Still bearish on IT

The Nifty IT index, which was among the worst sectoral performers in 2022, is up around 5 percent for the year, while the benchmark Nifty 50 is down over 2 percent. Last year, fears of a looming recession in the US and Europe that would eventually result in a clampdown of IT spending caused analysts to downgrade the stocks.

The narrative has not seen any drastic change this year, despite a decent Q3 show by the sector, but some optimism is slowly creeping back in. Demand has moderated for IT services companies but remains reasonable, believe analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities.

“The possibility of outlasting the inflationary environment with just a slowdown/mild recession and continuous prioritization of tech spending has led to an optimistic outlook on tech spending by some clients even in the current weak macro,” they said in a recent report.

Tata Consultancy Services has 22 buy, 15 hold and 11 sell calls. Tech Mahindra has 21 buy, 15 hold and 8 sell calls. HCL Tech has 27 buy, 16 hold and 3 sell calls.

What’s up with NTPC?

The PSU firm is loved by analysts and currently boasts of 25 buy calls, 1 hold and zero sell calls. Its optimism score is 96.

This is largely on the back of monetisation of renewable assets in the near term, new thermal orders, and commissioning of pipeline plants. Foreign brokerage firm Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 198 per share.

Another key trigger is India’s increasing power demand. According to Sharekhan, India’s power demand grew strongly by 10 percent year-on-year in the first nine months of FY23, with a peak demand of 206 GW in December 2022.

“The outlook remains strong and bodes well for higher PLF (plant load factor) for thermal power plants and would benefit NTPC,” said the brokerage.

The Nifty IT index has been soaring over the past three trading sessions. It gained 1 percent on February 14, about 1.13 percent on February 15 and 1.71 percent on February 16, with all stocks fuelling the benchmark index higher.

The S&P BSE IT Index has also rallied in tandem, gaining over 3 percent in the past three sessions.

Tech Mahindra and Tata Consultancy Services have been the top gainers among the large-caps, while stock-specific developments propelled the share prices of smaller companies Nucleus Software and Tanla Platforms higher.

A set of in-line quarterly results, moderate deal wins, and ‘buy on dips’ seem to be aiding the sector, analysts said. The Nifty IT index, which was among the worst sectoral performers in 2022, is up over 7 percent for the year, while the benchmark Nifty 50 is down 1 percent.

“A recession view for the developed markets, which was a consensus a few months ago, still holds but with reduced intensity,” Kotak Securities said in a recent report.

Majority of IT companies' revenue is derived from the Americas, and retail sector is the largest business segment for these players followed by financial services. ""The US retail sales data print this week showed a stark recovery which has supported the IT stocks, and additionally, interest rates seem to be nearing their peak with most of the hikes behind us,"" Sreeram Ramdas, vice president at Green Portfolio, said.

Billion dollar deals

Though fears of recession in the US and Europe and reduced client spending continue linger, several large-cap IT companies signed billion-dollar deals in Q3.

According to Bernstein Research, “There is now a divergence of execution between large-caps and mid-caps as large deals intensity has started picking up with clients focusing on vendor consolidation.”

Vendor consolidation means reducing the number of external suppliers to a handful of trusted partners.

In Q3, Wipro signed 11 large deals with a total contract value of over $1 billion. Infosys signed 32 large deals worth $3.3 billion last quarter, the highest in eight quarters. The total contract value for TCS was steady at $7.8 billion.

The Tata group IT firm recently announced a £600-million contract with the UK-based Phoenix Group, which was the largest for TCS in this financial year and its largest in the UK after three years.

Margin recovery

Most IT companies reported sequential improvement in margins in Q3.

According to Moody’s, improving employee utilisation from hiring in prior years and steadily declining attrition will likely arrest further margin pressure.

For stocks under Jefferies’ coverage, aggregate margins recovered by 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 20.6 percent. Midsized firms fared worse, with their aggregate margins down 130 basis points QoQ against a 70 basis point expansion by large-sized IT firms.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Large-caps remain favourites

The Street anticipates the slowdown in global IT spending at about 3-4 percent against 6 percent and 8 percent in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In this backdrop, large-cap IT companies will emerge as winners as there is an “extraordinarily high barrier to sign large deals,” Bernstein said.

“Only six-eight players can compete and win. The ability to structure large billion-dollar deals requires deep understanding of the new technology stack, strengths in integrated service lines, which only large IT services players can provide,” the firm said.

Infosys remains the top pick for analysts and brokerage houses, given its superior revenue growth. Moody’s expects 13 percent revenue growth for Infosys compared to 8 percent revenue growth for TCS in FY23. Moreover, Infosys surprised investors by raising its revenue growth guidance during the Q3 results announcement.

For Jefferies, Infosys is the only pick in the sector. Bernstein analysts have ‘outperform’ ratings on TCS and Tech Mahindra too. They like TCS for its billion-dollar deal playbook and Tech Mahindra for its reasonable valuation. They have ‘market-perform’ ratings for Wipro and HCL Technologies.

Word of caution

The Nifty IT is trading at an above-average premium of 25 percent to the Nifty and valuations remain rich, Jefferies said. It has a cautious stance on the sector.

Kotak Securities said a deep recession is not fully priced in.

“The stocks are at an interesting juncture—moderate upside if it is just a slowdown in developed economies, moderate downside in case of a recession,” it said in a recent report.

Shares of HCL Technologies were trading in the red early on February 10 tracking changes in MSCI review. At 10:58 am, shares of the technology major were trading at Rs 1119.95 apiece, down 2.3 percent, on the BSE - making it the worst performer on the Nifty50 index.

The weightage of HCL Technologies in the MSCI index has been reduced which could trigger an outflow of about $97 million, according to Abhilash Pagaria of Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research.

The brokerage firm’s note showed that the proforma weightage of the stock in the index is 1.5 percent and the weightage reduction is of 0.2 basis points which will result in the selling of seven million shares.

Along with HCL Technologies, other stocks that are likely to witness selling due to a reduction in weightage are Jindal Steel & Power (-$19 million), Shriram Finance (-$14 million), ACC (-$12 million), but the heaviest outflow among all is likely to be witnessed in Adani Transmission (-$145 million), Adani Total Gas (-$110 million) and Adani Enterprises (-$161 million), as per the brokerage firm.

Year-to-date (YTD), the stock is up nearly 8 percent. Overall, several fund managers now believe that the IT stocks look attractive. HCL Technologies stock is 10.5 percent away from its 52-week high of Rs 1,215, taking into account today’s low."
"February 09, 2023 08:23 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/contrarian-calls-adani-ports-faces-investors-wrath-after-hindenburg-report-but-finds-favour-with-analysts-10043421.html,"Representative image

When 2023 came knocking, investors were ready for a pause in interest rate hikes, slow cooling off of inflation, decreased volatility in raw material prices and slightly better returns from equity markets. But things don’t always go as planned.

A report by Hindenburg Research, dated January 24, caused mayhem in Adani group stocks, most of them declining over 50 percent in a week’s time. The Nifty 50, which houses Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports, also fell 2.8 percent in that time.

Cautious investors sold shares as the report accused the group of “stock manipulation” and “accounting fraud”. On the flip side, analysts continued to remain positive on Adani Ports, which saw upgrades increase by 3.9 percent in January.

Of the 21 brokerages covering the stock now, it has 20 buy calls and 1 hold call. A month ago, 23 brokerages were covering the stock with 21 buy and 2 hold calls.

The company is on a journey to become India's largest integrated transport utility company by 2030. Though it has a considerable amount of debt (about Rs 42,500 crore as of FY22 end), the management has said that it is building a war chest for the acquisition Container Corporation of India (Concor).

According to foreign brokerage Jefferies, “Follow-ups to the National Logistics’ Policy (NLP), continuing GST (goods and services tax)-driven organised players’ share gain, Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) traffic increase and Concor privatisation should play out for the logistics sector in 2023.”

Its base case scenario for the stock is Rs 995 while the bull case target is Rs 1,330, as the company expands its market share from 14 percent in FY15 to 31 percent by FY25.

The stock got an upgrade from Kotak Institutional Equities to buy from add on January 26, with the target price unchanged at Rs 860 a share. “At its current 11.5x FY2024E EV/EBITDA, the stock provides comfort for any unforeseen risks that may arise over time."" Kotak said in its report.

Another big conglomerate, Reliance Industries, saw its price decrease 8.8 percent in January but upgrades increased by 5.16 percent. Windfall tax and a muted earnings show by the mainstay O2C (oil-to-chemicals) business remain a major overhang on the stock. But analysts believe the Street is not fully pricing in the prospects of Reliance’s retail business and new energy opportunities.

BOB Capital Markets upgraded the stock to a buy rating, raising the target price to Rs 2,840 from Rs 2,670. “We believe listing of the digital services and retail arms will be linked to the achievement of operational milestones that have been delayed by Covid-19. We upgrade as a 12 percent correction since November 2022 opens up an opportunity to enter the stock,” it noted.

Among contrarian downgrades over January, HCL Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro and Tech Mahindra rose 10.46 percent, 7.63 percent, 5.73 percent and 2 percent even as analysts’ pessimism trickled in. The stocks saw ‘buy on dips’ in the month after significant selling last year.

Meanwhile, buy calls are declining for IT stocks as managements have started flagging concerns in the European and US markets. For instance, Antique Stock Broking downgraded Tata Consultancy Services to hold after the third-quarter results, with the target cut to Rs 3,600 from Rs 3,700, citing macroeconomic uncertainties in the US that could pose a downside risk. “Q3 results offer limited reasons to change our cautious view on the sector,” noted most foreign brokerages.

Quarterly change

In quarterly calls, too, Adani Ports topped the list of contrarian upgrades. The other stock that gains prominence is Bajaj Finance. The NBFC stock has corrected 16.9 percent over the last three months, while its buy calls have gone up from 19 to 25. The correction has come on the back of slow growth in AUM (assets under management) and new loans.

But this correction has made the stock attractive for analysts. HDFC Securities upgraded it to Add in January, with a target price of Rs 6,700. “While our concerns on the quality of earnings from the new-to-franchise (NTF) customers and new products remain, the sharp 20 percent correction in the past few months appears at a disconnect from the franchise earnings potential,” the firm said.

Titan’s share price decreased 10.45 percent, but buy calls increased from 25 to 27 in the quarter gone by. The reason for the upgrades is similar to that of Bajaj Finance—a 17 percent correction from peak that has made valuations reasonable.

Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher have recently upgraded the stock to buy and increased FY23/FY24/FY25 earnings per share estimates by 1.5 percent/2 percent/2 percent on the back of strong underlying demand trends across divisions and a correction from the peak.

In contrarian downgrades, apart from IT stocks, HDFC and Hero MotoCorp have made it to the list. The stocks have gained 7.2 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, in the last quarter while buy calls have tumbled.

Investors’ optimism on both the stocks largely arose from anticipated higher consumer spending during the festive season and the period after that, be it discretionary purchases like a two-wheeler or investing in real estate. However, that hasn’t played out according to the script with inflation burning a hole in Indians’ pockets.

Axis Securities downgraded Hero MotoCorp in November from buy to hold. “Rural demand momentum, maintaining a strong share in the entry-level segment and building a product portfolio in the premium segment will be the key challenges in our view for the company,” it said. The number of buy call on the stock has come down to 28 from 32 in the last quarter.

For HDFC, buy calls have come down from 27 to 25, but there are no sell calls on the stock. Nuvama Institutional Equities is the only brokerage with a hold call. “Merger narrative will drive stock price. Historically, entities that have merged have traded at a discount to the merger ratio,” as per Nuvama.

Yearly change

For the 12 months ended January 2023, the list of contrarian upgrades and downgrades were well-balanced.

Here, too, Adani Ports tops the contrarian upgrades list along with Bajaj Finance. Adani Enterprises, too, has seen upgrades but that is because it has gone from 1 hold to 1 buy and 1 hold call.

Then comes HDFC Life that has seen its price fall by 23.42 percent. From 29 buy, 10 hold and 1 sell calls, it now has 25 buy, 3 hold and 3 sell calls. Optically, it looks like an upgrade but the number of analysts covering the stock has also fallen.

Over the past year, HDFC Life’s acquisition of Exide Life was viewed as a positive trigger by the brokerage community. However, the Street did not like the fact that the deal was expensive.

Among recent triggers, taxation on high-value insurance policies that was announced in Budget 2023 has come as a rude shock for the stock.

Tata Motors is the next stock in the contrarian upgrades list with its price falling 11 percent but buy calls going up to 27 from 25. The company had been posting losses for the last seven quarters, but was back in the black in October-December 2022.

CLSA has upgraded its rating on the stock with a buy tag and target price of Rs 512 a share. It expects the Jaguar Land Rover division’s margin profile to improve led by volume growth, and for commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles (PV), business margin to improve on lower commodity costs and price hikes.

""Improvement in volume and margin profile to aid free cash generation in FY24,"" it said.

Apollo Hospitals saw its share price decrease by 9.4 percent but buy call went up to 25 from 23 over the past one year. While the stock fall came on the back of some profit-booking after the significant run-up during COVID-19 years, the upgrades were largely driven by optimism on the hospital chain’s execution.

UBS believes that Apollo Hospitals is executing well on new initiatives, growth and core segments, and that the market is not pricing in an early success of its digital strategy.

Among contrarian downgrades, Coal India stands out. The stock has gained 36.5 percent in the past one year while buy calls have come down to 16 from 21. Downgrades have trickled in as international coal prices are sliding and e-auction premiums are also expected to fall soon. The company’s revised annual wage bill at Rs 46,000 crore will also weigh on its financial performance, pointed out analysts.

JSW Steel and Bharti Airtel’s share price rose 8.5 percent each but buy calls reduced to 19 from 6 and to 27 from 31, respectively.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on HCL Tech

HCLT posted operating performance beat in Q3 due to better-than-expected strength in the software business. Revenue grew by 5% CC QoQ because of strong performance in the software business (30.5% CC QoQ), while the services business (2.2% CC) delivered broadly in-line performance. Growth in the services business was steady despite higher-than-usual furloughs in financial services (-1.7% CC QoQ), ramp-down by clients under stress in retail (-0.6%), and impact from furloughs and spending optimization by clients in technology and services (0.1%). Deal intake remained healthy at USD2.35bn in Q3, led by IT operating model transformation, cloud adoption, and large vendor consolidation deals. Management expects revenue growth in Q4 to be weak QoQ due to seasonality in the software business. However, management remains confident about the medium-term growth outlook due to market share gain, strong deal intake, and deal pipeline. HCLT has narrowed its overall revenue growth guidance to 13.5-14.0% CC (earlier 13.5-14.5%) and EBITM guidance to 18.0-18.5% for FY23 (earlier 18-19%). HCLT has also narrowed down its services revenue growth guidance to 16.0- 16.5% CC for FY23 (earlier 16-17%), implying 1.0-2.5% QoQ growth in Q4.

Outlook

We raise our earnings estimates by 1.4-1.8% for FY23E-25E, factoring in Q3 performance. We maintain BUY with a TP of Rs1,125/share at 17x Dec-24E EPS (earlier Rs1,100).

HCL Technologies on January 12 reported a 20 percent rise in its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2022 (Q3FY23) at Rs 4,096 crore as against Rs 3,442 crore a year back.

Its consolidated revenue from operations increased 19.61 percent to Rs 26,700 crore against Rs 22,321 crore in the corresponding quarter last year, the company said in an exchange filing.

The numbers beat estimates as according to a poll of brokerages, consolidated revenue was expected to come in Rs 26,026 crore, up 16.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth, while consolidated profit after tax (PAT) was estimated to increase 10.6 percent YoY to Rs 3,796 crore.

Revenue in terms of constant currency was up 5 percent sequentially and 13.1 percent year-on-year (YoY).

The company said it won 17 large deals during the quarter - seven in the services segment and 10 in software. The total contract value (TCV) of new deal wins was at $2.35 billion, up 10 percent YoY.

The Board of Directors has also declared an interim dividend of Rs 10 per equity share for FY23. The record date is set as January 20. The Payment date shall be February 1, 2023.

HCL Tech said the EBIT margin during the quarter was at 19.6 percent, up 165 bps sequentially. Net margin stood at 15.3 percent, up 117 bps sequentially.

“We have delivered a strong performance this quarter across all key metrics – revenue growth, margin expansion, booking growth and people metrics,"" said C Vijayakumar, CEO & Managing Director, HCLTech. ""Our strong revenue growth is led by our services business which grew 15.4 percent YoY

CC. Our margins at 19.6 percent this quarter, increased 60 basis points YoY.""

Providing guidance for FY23, the company said revenue is expected to be between 13.5-14 percent YoY in constant currency. Services revenue is expected to be 16-16.5 percent YoY in constant currency. It said the EBIT margin will likely narrow to 18-18.5 percent.

The last twelve-month attrition rate - a measure of employees leaving the company voluntarily - was at 21.7 percent down from 23.8 percent in the September quarter and higher than 19.8 percent in the December quarter last year.

The company overall added 2,945 employees during the quarter, taking the total headcount to 2,22,270. It also added 5,892 freshers during the quarter."

HCL Technologies is all set to report its October-December earnings numbers on January 12 and analysts are forecasting a 3 percent sequential growth in constant currency (CC) terms, which is likely to be greater than its peers.

TCS reported CC revenue growth of 2.2 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), while Infosys is expected to clock 1.1 percent QoQ.

According to a poll of brokerages, consolidated revenue might come in at Rs 26,026 crore, registering 16.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth, while consolidated profit after tax (PAT) is expected to increase 10.6 percent YoY to Rs 3,796 crore.

​

At its investor day held on December 8 in New York, the company’s management had flagged off that Q3 FY23 will see higher-than-expected furloughs, with BFSI and hi-tech being the problem areas.

Analysts are pegging earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin at 18.9 percent for the quarter. This indicates a near 95-basis-point (bps) expansion. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

If it weren’t for the furloughs, margin expansion could have been greater on the back of rupee depreciation and a slight shift in revenue mix towards the higher-margin Products & Platforms (P&P) business, said analysts at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.

Meanwhile, Kotak Institutional Equities is forecasting 12.7 percent sequential CC growth in products business and 14 percent decline on YoY comparison. On the other hand, services segment is seen clocking 2 percent CC growth QoQ.

“The Products and platforms segment might report a sharp rebound sequentially, driven by seasonal strength. Overall growth will be aided by this segment,” according to analysts at Emkay Global and Nomura.

Coming to deal wins, the total contract value might be flat in Q3 FY23 around $2 billion, compared to $2.38 billion recorded in the previous quarter. As indicated earlier by the management, the company believes it will continue to win deals in North America while Europe may see some slowdown.

In the intra-quarter update, top brass said they expect revenue growth to be at the lower end of the 13.5-14.5 percent band for FY23 and this guidance is likely to be maintained, said analysts.

Other key monitorables are:

- Impact on discretionary businesses, i.e., products and engineering and R&D services (ERS) in the event of recession

- Pricing environment and attrition

- Outcome of clients’ budgeting process

- Levers to increase margins

- Large deal activity in the market

Share price of IT firm HCL Technologies opened 4 percent lower on December 9 after the management indicated that FY23 revenue growth will be at the lower end of earlier guidance.

At its investor day held on December 8 in New York, the company said revenue growth in constant currency terms is seen at lower end of 13.5-14.5 percent YoY band.

The stock which is the biggest index loser was quoting at Rs 1043.20, lower by 5.27 percent on the National Stock Exchange at 9:30 am. Trading volumes at 3.1 million shares were higher than 20-day average volume of 2.6 million shares.

The company’s management said the December quarter will see higher-than-expected furloughs, with BFSI and hi-tech being the problem areas. Analysts at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities called this an industry-wide problem and not an HCL Tech-specific one.

“We get the sense that December 2022 and possibly March 2023 are likely going to be growth challenged quarters for the industry; may be a bit more than earlier anticipated,” they said in a recent report.

HCL Tech management also foresees pricing pressures in FY24. The company hinted that price increases are more selective now than they were 2-3 quarters back. “We believe that instead of a typical budget flush, there is likely under-spending of budgets that could affect Dec 2022 quarter revenue,” added Nirmal Bang.

For the quarter ended September, HCL Tech’s net profit increased 7.05 percent to Rs 3,489 crore from Rs 3,259 core reported a year ago. Revenue from operations stood at Rs 24,686 crore, clocking 19.5 percent growth over Rs 20,655 crore last year, according to a stock exchange filing.

The numbers were better than analyst expectations, following which the stock saw rating upgrades over the last quarter. 'Buy' calls went up to 33 from 28, while 'Sell' calls went down from 6 to 3 in the last quarter.

With the curtains coming down on India Inc’s Q2FY23 earnings season, analysts were busy in November making rating revisions and upgrading their outlook for stocks that managed to beat the consensus. Britannia saw the maximum upgrades after a solid earnings beat while Divi’s Labs was shunned by analysts after its Q2 net profit slumped 18 percent year-on-year.

While all fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies reported a margin decline in the September quarter due to the high cost of inventory, Britannia’s EBITDA margins expanded to 16.3 percent from 15.5 percent in the same quarter last fiscal. In its earnings press release, the company said it had added 28,000 rural preferred dealers, leading to consistent market share gains, now at a 15-year high.

Also Read: How Britannia managed to trump analysts and its FMCG peers

From 20 ‘buy’, 16 ‘hold’ and 4 ‘sell’ calls in October, the stock was upgraded to 27 ‘buy’, 12 ‘hold’ and 3 ‘sell’ calls. It has managed to turn its fortunes around after spending several months in the ‘Maximum Pessimism’ stock list.

As commodity prices have now eased and the high cost inventory has been passed on, analysts believe FMCG margins are set to expand with volumes reviving on a bounceback in rural demand. Riding on this, HUL, Tata Consumer Products and ITC also saw slight upgrades in their ratings over the last month.

Meanwhile, Divi’s Labs and Cipla were among the top three stocks that witnessed the maximum downgrades over the last month. This was largely on the back of the pharma sector posting muted Q2FY23 numbers given the high base in the year-ago quarter, which was boosted by sales of COVID-19 linked treatment drugs.

Divi’s Labs’ net profit dropped 18.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 493.6 crore, and revenue was also 6.7 percent lower. ICICI Direct downgraded the stock from ‘Buy’ to ‘Hold’ stating, “We are keeping a tab on future custom synthesis ex-Covid opportunities and execution besides steady generics traction.”

Auto companies Tata Motors and Eicher Motors were next in line in the list of stocks with maximum downgrades over the past month. In Q2FY23, Tata Motors reported a higher-than-expected loss of Rs 944.61 crore and Jaguar Land Rover’s wholesale volume grew only 4 percent, which was lower than what the company had planned.

As losses continue, brokerages fear that the Tata group company’s zero net debt target could get pushed beyond FY25 from FY24. Adding to investors’ woes, JLR has announced a production cut in its UK factories in 2023 due to semiconductor issues, which indicates that chip shortage problems continue to haunt the carmarker. ‘Buy’ calls on the stock have come down to 23 from 26 in October.

Eicher Motors, too, saw its ‘Buy’ calls decrease from 35 to 32 over the last month. While the company posted 76 percent year-on-year growth in Q2, analysts are wary of increasing competition in the premium 250 cc and above category (like the launch of TVS Ronin). Nomura analysts expect Royal Enfield’s market share to reduce from 86 percent to 74 percent by FY30 as competition comes in.

Year-On-Year Changes

On the flipside, Eicher Motors also features in the list of maximum upgrades over the year ended November. The upgrades were largely on the back of expensive valuations correcting in March 2022, when the stock fell from the Rs 2,800-level to Rs 2,110. The company’s commercial vehicle business also remains in favour with analysts. Sharekhan expects the segment’s contribution to the company’s PBT to quadruple — from 3 percent last fiscal to 12 percent in the next.

Adani Enterprises, the newest entrant in the Nifty 50, now has one buy call compared to nil buy calls in November last year. Despite a trailing P/E valuation of 360x, analysts at Ventura Securities have a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 4,310 per share.

The brokerage firm believes that AEL will be exploring green energy opportunities across the globe and any announcement towards the same can lead to further rerating of the stock, beyond their estimates.

HDFC Life went from 28 ‘buy’ calls to 31 ‘buy’ calls over the last one year as the company’s acquisition of Exide Life inched towards the finish line. The merger will add 1.3 percent to HDFC Life’s market share, according to the management. While the expensive deal valuation ruffled some feathers, analysts are positive on the newer southern geographies and Tier-2, Tier-3 cities that HDFC Life will now have access to.

Aditya Birla Group’s flagship company Grasim was the next in line for maximum upgrades. Brokerages were particularly impressed by the company doubling its capex to Rs 10,000 crore by FY25 to set up the paints business and start production from the fourth quarter of 2023-24. Foreign brokerage firm Jefferies has called this the ‘Jio moment’ for the paints industry.

Meanwhile, steel major JSW Steel and oil PSU Bharat Petroleum continued to top the list of maximum downgrades in the past one year. JSW Steel saw its ‘buy’ calls go down from 19 to 6 on the back of falling metal prices and export duty imposition earlier in the year.

Despite the rollback of export duty in November, not many brokerages upgraded their rating on the stock. According to CLSA, a “broad-based policy stimulus in China — which is likely to drive steel prices higher — is the key determinant.” Tata Steel, too, saw its downgrades increase in the past twelve months.

BPCL’s ‘buy’ calls plunged down to 25 from 35 in November last year as brokerages removed the privatisation premium from the stock. Union Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has indicated there is “no proposal whatsoever” on his table regarding a BPCL divestment as of now.

Tech Mahindra and Wipro are the other big names that saw downgrades increase as a looming recession in the US and European Union could spoil their fortunes in these markets.

Quarter-On-Quarter Changes

On the flipside, their peers HCL Tech and Infosys managed to earn rating upgrades over the last quarter after surprising the Street with their Q2FY23 numbers. In fact, Infosys has been narrowing its revenue gap with Cognizant, noted Kotak Securities.

“Infosys’ quarterly revenue run-rate of $4.55 bn is just $300 mn away from Cognizant’s revenues. Infosys’ headcount at 345000 employees is just 4000 shy of Cognizant’s. We would not be surprised if Infosys reclaims revenue leadership in the coming quarters,” the brokerage firm noted.

The Street has also been enthused by the IT major’s open market share buyback programme amounting to Rs 9,300 crore, at a maximum price of Rs 1,850 per share.

For HCL Tech, analysts had expected 3 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated net profit in Q2. Beating expectations by a big margin, the company posted 7.05 percent growth in PAT and 19.5 percent growth in revenue from operations.

“Consistency in revenue growth in services and improving EBIT growth should drive re-rating. Valuation being at a steep discount to peers makes risk-reward favourable,” said Morgan Stanley about the stock.

Apart from Divi’s Labs, Tata Motors and BPCL, telecom operator Bharti Airtel saw its downgrades increase slightly over the last quarter. ‘Buy’ calls on the stock went down from 30 to 28. ‘Hold’ calls went up to 4 from 2. Analysts were anticipating a tariff hike by the company in the last quarter to improve ARPUs (average revenue per user).

Airtel started testing the waters by raising tariffs for entry-level plans in Haryana and Odisha, in the last week of November.

The report pertains to HCL Group, not HCL Tech, the clarification said.

The clarification came from the company following November 8 reports that Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and HCL Group were independently “evaluating” deals to pick up 30 percent equity stake each in semiconductor wafer fab applicant ISMC Analog.

It is likely that both RIL and HCL will invest through subsidiaries with an estimated total investment from both parties likely to exceed Rs 4,000 crore ($500-600 million). The terms for both proposed agreements have been signed recently, the report added.

India had last December approved a $10-billion incentive plan to attract semiconductor and display manufacturers deepening the push to establish the country as a global electronics production hub. Under the Semicon scheme, the Centre announced to make upfront investments – 50 percent tax support under recent amendments – to support semiconductor wafer factory proposals submitted by various corporate entities."

Emkay Global Financial's research report on HCL Tech

HCLT delivered better-than-expected operating performance in Q2. The demand environment continues to be healthy and fairly broad-based. Management remains confident about the near-to-medium term growth outlook on the back of strong deal intake and deal pipeline. HCLT has increased its revenue growth guidance to 13.5- 14.5% CC (earlier, 12-14%) for FY23, implying 2.6-3.8% CQGR in H2, on the back of continued traction in the services business, product business seasonality, healthy deal intake (USD2.38bn in Q2FY23) and strong momentum in Cloud, Digital & Engineering services. Management has revised EBITM guidance to 18-19% for FY23 (earlier, 18- 20%), and the strong recovery in Q2 grants it confidence on delivering within the guided range. We raise our earnings by 0.9% to 2.5% for FY23E-25E, factoring-in the Q2 performance.

Outlook

We maintain BUY, with a TP of Rs1,070/share at 17x Sep-24E EPS (earlier, Rs1,060), considering reasonable valuations and the >4% dividend yield.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after earnings.

UBS

We maintain a 'neutral' rating on the stock with a target of Rs 965.

The commentary and performance almost defy any major slowdown risk. The management highlighted acceleration of cost saving projects.

We expect investors to react positively given strong Q2 execution.

JPMorgan

We have kept an 'underweight' rating on the stock and raised the target price to Rs 850 from Rs 820.

The company has reported an all-round beat for Q2. Revenue outperformance came from services business and forecast for H2 appears ambitious.

Margin recovery to 18% is a key achievement helped by sharp 100 basis point realisation increase, while margin forecast of 18-19 percent implies a further margin recovery in Q3.

Macquarie

We have kept an 'outperform' call on the stock with a target of Rs 1,420.

The firm posted a good beat on all counts with no one-offs, and the management is confident about services growth.

Morgan Stanley

We have upgraded the stock to 'overweight' from 'underweight' and raised the target price to Rs 1,100 from Rs 870.

Consistency in revenue growth in services and improving EBIT growth should drive re-rating. Valuation being at a steep discount to peers makes risk-reward favourable.

We raise FY23/24/25 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 1.6%/5/9%/5.6% and FY23-25 EBIT margin assumptions by 46-73 basis points.

Nomura

We maintain 'neutral' rating on the stock and raise the target price to Rs 980.

The Q2 beat on all counts and healthy deal wins & robust pipeline give comfort.

We raise FY23-24 EPS estimate and target by 4%.

Sharekhan

HCL Tech is expected to achieve its revenue growth forecast in FY2023 given its strength in digital foundation, unique integrated infrastructure and app services, and leadership in the fast-growing ERD segment.

Notwithstanding volatility in stock performance, we believe the stock offers favorable risk-reward ratio at current levels for long-term investment.

We continue to prefer HCL Tech, given strong capabilities in digital foundation, higher payout ratio, healthy deal wins and reasonable valuation of 17x/15x/13x its FY2023E/FY2024E/FY2024E earnings. Hence, we maintain buy rating on the stock with an unchanged price target of Rs 1,140.

IT major HCL Technologies, now rebranded as HCLTech, on October 12 said its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended September 2022 increased 7.05 percent to Rs 3,489 crore from Rs 3,259 core reported a year ago.

Revenue from operations stood at Rs 24,686 crore, clocking a 19.5 percent growth over Rs 20,655 crore last year, according to a stock exchange filing.

Sequentially, revenue rose 5.2 percent quarter on quarter (QoQ) from Rs 23,464 crore. Profit climbed 6.27 percent compared to Rs 3,283 crore in the previous quarter.

The numbers were better than expectations. Brokerages polled by Moneycontrol had expected net profit to jump 2.7 percent on a sequential basis while revenue was expected to increase 3.4 percent, aided by rupee depreciation.

The company said its constant currency revenue was up 3.8 percent QoQ and 15.8 percent year on year (YoY). IT services revenue rose 5.3 percent QoQ and up 18.9 percent YoY in constant currency.

The company’s EBIT margin for the quarter was at 18 percent, up 93 basis points QoQ. Net profit margin also appreciated 12 basis points QoQ to 14.1 percent.

HCLTech said it won 11 large deals – 8 in services and 3 in products. Total contract value of new deal wins was at $ 2,384 million, up 16 percent QoQ, up 6 percent YoY.

“Our bookings and pipeline continue to be very strong that augurs well for our future growth,” said C Vijayakumar, CEO & Managing Director, HCLTech. “These reflect our constant and continuing efforts to supercharge outcomes for all our stakeholders.”

In its guidance, the company management said services revenue is expected to grow 16-17 percent YoY in constant currency while it increased revenue guidance to 13.5-14.5 percent YoY in constant currency thanks to higher deal wins in the first half of the fiscal. EBIT margin guidance was revised to 18-19 percent.

The Board of Directors of HCLTech also declared an interim dividend of Rs 10 per equity share. The record date for the payment of dividend is October 20, 2022. The payment date of the interim dividend shall be November 2, 2022.

The company said overall, it added 8,359 employees during the quarter, taking the headcount to 2,19,325. This includes 10,339 freshers. Last twelve month attrition was at 23.8 percent in IT Services."

Macquarie Capital's Ravi Menon said Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has higher exposure to life and annuity insurance applications. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Menon shared his views on the outlook of TCS and Infosys's share buyback proposal.

He said, ""People are worried about the net hiring being weak and that being an indication of poor demand. I don’t think that. We think they have built a big buffer of bench, if you come from pre-COVID to now. They are at nearly 38 percent of headcount while revenue is up by only 23 percent.""

TCS on Monday said its attrition rate in the July-September period had jumped to 21.5 percent versus 19.70 percent quarter-on-quarter.

Menon also opined that Europe's manufacturing woes will get over in the next few months while adding that Infosys has a large part of deals in Europe.

Looking at TCS' margin picture which was reported at 24 percent but had a currency impact on it, Menon said, ""The currency does play a role in this. You'll have at least another 200-300 basis points at revenue utilisation and that will flow down straight to the markets which then gets back to the 26-28 percent band.""

He also added that as attrition starts coming down, naturally margin would start moving up.

TCS reported an annualised 8.4 percent growth in net income at Rs 10,431 crore for the September quarter. The Tata Group company said its total revenue from services grew at a much faster pace of 18 percent to touch Rs 54,309 crore in the period under review.

Discussing companies with the highest exposure to insurance, Menon informed that TCS is a little bit higher in that regard. ""Especially because they are insuring banks as well but that is primarily on the life and annuity side.""

Also commenting on the delaying of the hiring process in regards to Wipro, Infosys, HCL Tech and the likes, Menon said, ""We are looking at pretty healthy growth from all the firms. We are looking at marginal improvement also ranging from 40-60 basis points."" He added, ""Every year... some offers are cancelled anyway. I wouldn't really be worried too much.""

Meanwhile, Infosys said that the board would consider a buyback of shares on Thursday, with the earnings for the quarter ended September.

The software major conducted a share buyback in September 2021 and bought back shares worth Rs 9,200 crore through the open market."

The worst of the commodity price spike the world experienced in the first six months of 2022 is behind us, says Sandeep Bhatia, the Head of Equity and Country Head-India at Macquarie Group.

Prices of oil and other commodities had surged in the lead-up to and the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, but have since eased.

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Bhatia shared his views on the current market rally and spoke about the Information Technology (IT) sector, future of electric vehicles and the scope offered by the country’s defence sector.

The National Stock Exchange (NSE) benchmark Nifty50 on Tuesday closed above the psychological level of 18,000 points. ""Diwali has come a month early in the markets,"" Bhatia said.

He added: ""We’ll probably go into the third quarter of this financial year or fourth quarter of this current year quite strong. The market has legs to it.""

The only disappointment, according to Bhatia, has been a ""sort of weak monsoon"".

Moving on, he spoke about broader industrial consumption trends which ""are still holding up."" He expects the market to rise by another 8-10 percent in the next three to four months.

According to him, in the first quarter of next year, with the budget around the corner, there is a possibility of investors booking profits.

Verdict on large cap IT names

""We like the IT sector. We like HCL Tech, TCS, Infosys, so we definitely like that. Our call here is that we’ll continue to see decent earnings growth -- 10 to 12 percent earnings growth,"" Bhatia said.

Given negativity around the IT sector because of expectations of a recession in the US and European Union, Bhatia said ""we are seeing a lot of pushback.""

He added: ""US will not have as big and as deep a recession as we have seen in the previous cycle. So to that extent, the IT sector offers very good value at current levels.""

Operational pressure

Apart from US recession concerns, there exist worries over large companies such as Infosys and HCL Technologies, which are seeing margins at multi-quarter lows for the past 10-12 quarters.

Bhatia said there could be some negative news flow from the US, but even so India was not witnessing the kind of big layoffs that 2008 saw.

""I don’t think that the economy at least in the US will take such a big hit. I think the real challenge will be in Europe, not as much in US. At least on the entire balance between valuations, earnings, and growth, the IT sector stands out.""

Electric Vehicles

In the automobile industry, companies like Mahindra & Mahindra are making big investments in manufacturing Electric Vehicles (EVs). They are investing Rs 9,000-10,000 crore over the next couple of years in EVs.

Bhatia said the automobile industry and the EV space was worth looking at.

He added: ""I would still go with the large players, which are essentially Maruti, Tata Motors and Mahindra. Mahindra is being a standout because its product cycle has surprised both in terms of consumer response and the fact that the slew of products that have been launched have clearly upped the game in terms of product quality that M&M used to come out with.""

He picked Mahindra as the ""dark horse"" in the auto sector.

Bhatia expects Tata Motors and Mahindra to dominate the EV market over the next couple of years.

Defence sector

The defence sector is difficult to predict because it's lumpy and largely ""project and government-policy based,"" Bhatia said.

Structurally, the sector is headed in the direction of Make in India and on the defence front, some major platforms will see Indian corporate sectors come in and start contributing.

""Although if you want to look at it given the entire cycle of defence purchases in India, these will take five plus years if not more,"" he observed.

While it's worth keeping an eye on, ""I don't think you can deploy big sums of money or build any kind of big earnings projections which can be valid and credible in next 2-3 years,"" Bhatia said."

Shrinking margins amid rising fears of a global economic slowdown have battered the IT stocks to three-week lows with the BSE IT index shedding 1.2 percent on Tuesday.

The BSE IT Index lost 3.6 percent through the last four sessions of slump. It was down 22 percent so far this year. Among the major tech companies, Infosys fell 1.5 percent, Tata Consultancy Services 1 percent, Wipro 2 percent, HCL Technologies 1.4 percent, and Tech Mahindra was down 1.6 percent.

Rich valuations and an anticipated slowdown in IT spends, given the rising inflation and a likely slowdown in global growth, helped build the pressure on the IT stocks. A rising employee cost because of salary hikes and premium for hiring talent amid a sustained phase of attrition, too, added to the margin pressure for the IT companies.

The brunt is not merely on the investors. Moneycontrol had reported earlier that Infosys, TCS and Wipro deferred or reduced their variable payouts to employees for the April-June quarter to defend their margins.

""After reports of variable pay cuts by Wipro and TCS, there were similar reports from Infosys, clearly reflecting that things are not as bullish as the company managements indicated after their results,"" said Sandip Sabharwal of asksandipsabharwal.com. ""With an imminent recession in most western economies, the sector needs to be a clear underweight.""

Infosys’s operating margin contracted to 20.1 percent in the first quarter of FY23, as opposed to 23.7 percent in the first quarter of FY22 and 21.5 percent in the fourth quarter of FY22. Infosys headcount as of June 30 stood at 3,35,186.

Wipro’s operating margin was down to a low of 15 percent, down 2 percent sequentially and from 18.8 percent in the year-ago period. Its attrition rate in Q1FY23 was 23.3 percent, a shade better than 23.8 percent in the previous quarter. Attrition may increase with variable pay not being given.

TCS’s operating margin in Q1 was 23.1 percent, down from 25.5 percent from the year-ago quarter, which it attributed primarily to salary increases that were rolled out from April 1. For the quarter ending June 30, 2022, TCS had a headcount of 606,331 and added 14,136 associates.

""Sharp margin misses across scale IT Services vendors in the June quarter were deeper than feared with incremental growth coming at lower margins. We expect the margin erosion to persist in the medium term and stay meaningfully below LT trends due to reversal in employee-employer bargaining power, underwhelming graduate uptake, limited price increases, return in travel/facility costs and high onsite inflation,"" said JP Morgan in its latest report.

""With seven out of 11 techs up for a wage hike in 2Q, upcoming margin decline is likely to be more broad-based. We see limited incremental margin levers ahead to cope with wage increases, persistent retention costs, subcons and creeping up travel/facility costs and find FY23/24 margin expectations optimistic. We turn more bearish on the sector and highlight structural margins rather than growth slowdown should be key sector concern,"" JP Morgan report added."

Hiring and attrition remained pain points for information technology (IT) companies in the first quarter of the 2023 financial year amid an ongoing battle for tech talent.

The top five IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra — cumulatively added a net 59,704 employees in the three months ended June, including freshers and lateral hires.

Net additions at TCS, HCL and Infosys declined sequentially but Wipro and Tech Mahindra reported an increase. On a sequential basis, overall net additions were significantly down across these five companies, which had hired 85, 720 new employees in the three months ended March.

On a year-on-year basis, the number was an improvement over the first quarter of the last financial year, when these companies had hired 41,471 people.

The attrition rate inched up at Infosys, TCS and HCL nd moderated at Wipro and Tech Mahindra.

Hiring has been muted at many IT companies in the quarter, but hiring plans for FY23 are broadly on track, said Piyush Pandey, Lead Analyst - Institutional Equities, YES Securities.

Also read: Infosys grows fastest among peers, adds 21,171 people during the quarter

“Freshers also generally join from Q2 onwards so that also explains lower hiring for Q1. A few of these companies had slightly lower utilisation (due to big hiring in FY22) and have sufficient room to grow just by increasing utilisation,” Pandey said.

In FY23, TCS plans to hire 40,000 freshers, Infosys has guided for 50,000, Wipro 38,000, HCL 35,000 and Tech Mahindra around 10,000.

The difference in net additions this quarter at the top IT companies is a result of which of them reacted to the surge in demand cycle first when the pandemic broke out, and started hiring in large numbers consequentially, said Amit Chandra, Deputy Vice President, HDFC Securities.

Also read: TCS attrition rises to 19.7% in Q1FY23, 14,136 employees added during the quarter

“Some companies started hiring early, and the maximum bulk of hiring happened last year. Some started a bit late. So that's why the quarter-on-quarter variation you are seeing,” Chandra said.

“The general trend is that TCS started hiring a bit early, and Infosys, they're still hiring. You have to see this from the point of view of what happened pre-pandemic. For the last 3-4 years these companies didn't hire much,” Chandra told Moneycontrol.

Broadening of the pyramid

The hiring trends have been closely related to cost control and hence the operating margins of the IT companies. Over the past five-six quarters, these margins have been consistently declining, with many expecting them to bottom out in another quarter before starting to improve.

Wipro Chief Financial Officer Jatin Dalal said employee costs have had key impact on margins, calling “pyramid and fresher improvement” a key lever to improving margins.

The pyramid model involves having more employees with less experience at the bottom, which will help keep costs low, and fewer employees higher up the pyramid.

Dalal said Wipro intends to double fresher hiring from last year’s level adding that the company’s ability to “correct the pyramid through consistent improvement of the base and moving people up through the pyramid would be a big structural lever.”

Trainee bench

TCS Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan shared a similar outlook, stating that Q1 was a lighter quarter comparatively for trainee absorption by the company, with Q2 and Q3 being the main periods for hiring.

“Last year, we had gone very aggressive and hired through the year to build up a more than 100,000 trainee bench. This year is more normal. We're progressing well on that 40,000 [fresher hiring] mark,” he said.

Also read: Wipro Q1 net additions buck industry trend

C Vijayakumar, CEO of HCL Technologies, attributed the decline in net hiring from 11,000 in Q4FY22 to 2,089 in Q1FY23 to additional capacity created by hiring of both freshers and laterals.

""We have not moderated any hiring based on any demand environment. It's really to increase our utilization and better deployment of freshers,” he said, adding that the company plans to take onboard 10,000 freshers in Q2.

Pre-pandemic, IT companies didn’t hire much and concentrated on adoption of automation, for which “the industry is paying the price” now, said HDFC Securities’ Chandra.

With the pandemic leading to a sudden increase in demand for tech services, attrition was extremely high, especially among employees who had over three years of experience or were in the five-eight-year experience bracket.

Companies are aware that bringing freshers into the billing cycle takes a period of six-eight months, Chandra said.

HCL’s Vijayakumar said the average time to make a fresher billable was taking longer in some parts of the business."

Indian technology giants are always in a fray, but the recent trends indicate that Infosys has outplayed its immediate rivals TCS and HCL Tech, for yet another quarter.

Infosys, the second largest IT company in the country, delivered 21.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) constant currency revenue growth, while in rupee terms, the growth was 17.5 percent – more than Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Tech, the other two companies in the Top 3 league.

In terms of operating margins, however, Infosys' performance was worst with a contraction of 360 basis points on-year to 20 percent. TCS reported a 240-basis-point cut in margins to 23.1 percent and HCL Tech margin shrank 260 basis points to 17 percent.

“The Q1 earnings report suggests strong revenue growth with Infosys leading the Tier I techs on growth, though margins disappointed relative to expectations with a 150-bps sequential drop,” said Manik Taneja, Vice-President, JM Financial Services.

Analysts largely do not see any change in the trend.

Aniket Pande, Lead Analyst at ICICI Securities, said Infosys will remain the fastest growing in its IT coverage universe. “We do believe Infosys is well positioned to gain market share and is suitably equipped for industry-leading growth,” he said.

Broadly speaking, Pande is underweight on the IT sector and believes deployment in the sector should be very slow and gradual. However, he said that his pecking order in the IT space remains TCS, Infosys, Coforge and Persistent Systems.

Analysts have turned cautious on the IT sector recently as, after a bout of high growth, the numbers have started moving towards the mean. They see recession in the US and Europe as one of the key risks.

Most IT companies have also slowed down their hiring, at the same time attrition level remains high. All three companies discussed here reported attrition rate of IT services employees between 20 percent and 29 percent, with Infosys being on the higher end and TCS on the lower end. Hiring is considered as the lead indicator of demand as companies hire more when they believe there will be more demand in the future.

The management, however, has shrugged off these worries. Rajesh Gopinathan, the TCS chief executive, said one should not read too much into hiring numbers, and contended that hiring remains strong. He committed that the company will hire 40,000 freshers in FY23. HCL Tech also said its target to hire 30,000-35,000 freshers is intact.

What has been a positive surprise is that despite talks of slowdown management have either maintained or increased their revenue growth guidance. HCL Tech kept guidance at 12-14 percent CC growth in revenue and EBIT Margins to be in the 18-20 percent range.

Infosys increased FY23 revenue guidance to 14-16 percent while retaining margin guidance at 21-23 percent. Though analysts said both companies will likely see margins at the lower end of the guidance. TCS does not give any guidance but the management assured string growth.

“It (Infosys) expects to see benefits of utilisation improvement, pricing leverage, pyramid optimisation along with moderation in subcontracting expenses to aid margins going forward,” Taneja.

These factors will also work for other companies.

Talking about TCS, Pande said he believes margins have bottomed out and will improve hereon as subcontractor costs and supply-side cost pressures subside gradually given normalisation of demand going forward. “Besides, levers of pyramid optimisation, utilisation and INR depreciation will benefit margins, though impact of these will be backended.”

Analysts’ ratings have been mixed on all three stocks. However, most are neutral with some saying ‘buy’ on these counters given the headwinds and growth trajectory from hereon."

The deal wins were driven by services and product and platform verticals. TCV from services stood at $ 1.95 billion after bagging seven net new large deals. The product and platform business, which had declined by 24 percent QoQ last quarter, has started recovering, helping HCL bag nine net new large product deal wins and $104 million in revenue.

However, the overall deal wins is slightly lower on a QoQ basis as compared to the TCV of $2.26 billion reported in Q4FY22.

HCL Tech had a strong booking this quarter with 16 deals across life sciences, healthcare, manufacturing, financial services and technology segments. It’s a mix of large and mid-sized deals.

C Vijayakumar, CEO & MD, HCL Technologies said, “FY23 started on a strong note. Revenue grew 2.7 percent sequentially and 15.6 percent YoY in constant currency. Our services business grew 19 percent YoY. Our growth momentum was led by ER&D services and digital applications services with cloud transformation being a central feat across all verticals and solutions.”

He added, “We also saw strong recovery in product and platform business which grew 5.1 percent sequentially and 1.4 percent YoY in constant currency. We posted an EBIT performance of 17 percent this quarter. Margins in services business are under pressure mainly due to an increase in talent costs and transition costs. We have undertaken appropriate actions to improve our profitability profile, the results of which will start reflecting in coming quarters.”

Margin improvement initiatives for the company include both revenue and cost levers led by innovative pricing, rate increases and optimisation of the operating costs, both people and non-people.

Segment-wise growth came from engineering and R&D (ER&D) services which led with a 3.7 percent QoQ growth, followed by ITBS with a 2 percent growth QoQ.

HCL Tech is also getting more large-sized end-to-end engineering services deals, signing two large ones in Q1, one with a European ISP (internet service provider) and one with a global ISP.

Apparao V V, Chief Human Resource Officer, HCL Technologies said, “We added one percent headcount QoQ at 2,089. We are focusing on our utilisation. We had a great year in terms of adding headcount, we grew 23.4 percent and we are utilising that in a better manner.”

He added, “Our new headcount in new vista locations which include Nagpur and Vijayawada grew by 30.5 percent YoY which is very heartening for us as our supply chain gets distributed in new talent markets we explore. Same with our global new frontier areas like Poland, Bulgaria, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Mexico, Guatemala, and Brazil -- there too our headcount grew 30 percent YoY.”

In India, HCL Tech crossed 20,000 employees in new vista locations and in new frontier locations it crossed over 18,000.

“This gives us a very good spread in terms of talent sourcing and any business operations that are required,” Apparao said.

Fresher addition and upskilling

HCL Tech has added 6,023 freshers this quarter, which is almost doubling down compared to last year’s numbers in the same quarter and the company plans to onboard another 10,400 freshers in current quarter.

“In terms of training, we spent 2 million hours in Q1 and almost 40,000 employees got upskilled and deployed this year. And our internal fulfilment rate because of training both in terms of general skills and niche skills have increased significantly and internal fulfilment rate is touching 50 percent which is healthy, and expect to increase going forward,” Apparao said."

HCL Technologies, which has about 1,700 employees in troubled Sri Lanka, has set up a team to monitor the situation as the island nation grapples with food and fuel shortages amid record inflation and an economic crisis. While there has been no work disruption so far, it is preparing for all scenarios, with backup plans ready to move work and people to India.

Apart from Sri Lanka, Costa Rica, and Poland, HCL Tech is stepping up hiring in smaller Indian cities such as Madurai, Lucknow, and Nagpur as it looks toward fresher pools of talent amid booming demand for software services and rising attrition.

In an interview with Moneycontrol, VV Apparao, chief human resource officer of HCL Tech, explains the company’s efforts in augmenting the talent supply chain and steps it is taking to counter the challenges of hiring and attrition. Edited excerpts:

In Q4, HCL Tech reported attrition on the last 12-month basis jumped to 21.9 percent from 19.8 percent. When do you see attrition moderating?

We are already witnessing attrition moderating. In the last two quarters, attrition is at the same level – we are seeing it plateauing and marginally reducing. We do believe it will stay at these levels.

We believe that since the demand environment is still very robust and there are not enough supply channels out there, there is a gap in the market. So unless the supply channels increase, it’s very unlikely that attrition will go down to the earlier levels of 10 percent to 15 percent.

Are there specific measures you’re taking to counter the attrition spike?

We have taken three steps in augmenting our talent supply chain. We have new centres established in tier-two and tier-three cities. We started this six years back with the concept of taking people back to their roots. Today, they are quite scaled. Within centres at Madurai, Lucknow, and Nagpur, we have 20,000 people working. Last year, we added 30 percent, and this year again we are targeting another 30 percent of people to be added.

Globally also, we have increased the number of centres in the last three-four years. We are now present in Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Lithuania, Mexico, Guatemala, Brazil, and Costa Rica. Similarly, in Asia-Pacific, we added Sri Lanka and Vietnam. So all these are actually at taking off level, they’ve got a critical mass of 1,000 to 2,000 people. We are there scaling up.

We added 23,000 freshers last year, we are planning to increase it significantly this year. And as part of that, we have conducted an experiment with standard 12 students. We are training them for nine months in the classroom and then three months on-the-job training. These trained individuals are then deployed, when they can parallelly continue their education with institutes like BITS Pilani, and IIM Nagpur where we offer five-year integrated MBA programmes.

At the end of their degree, they have experience of four to five years under engineering. We started small because we wanted to perfect the art of training, deploying, and ensuring that customer deliverables happen. Now, we are scaling it up. We started with 80, and last year, we took 4,000. This year we are planning to double down on that and train 8,000. This programme gives us stability because while they work with us and complete their education, we get at least six years of stability.

What are the challenges that the company faces while strengthening its workforce in terms of offer shopping and offer rejection?

Definitely, as a part of the industry, we are facing challenges. Earlier, people taking offers and not joining used to be around 25 percent or so. It has gone up to 40 percent now because the demand environment is so high. If people get a job, they resign and then they’re in the market before they join their new work.

And within the 90 days’ notice, they will collect another two or three offers because the market is so hot. But then, you can join only at one place. They will negotiate, take the best offer and join that. So the rejection percentage has gone up for everyone and I’m thankful that we are probably 10 percent or 15 percent lower than others, but we are facing the same problems.

What impact will inflation have on wages?

The company is witnessing wage inflation as it continues to recruit new talent. The increase in hiring comes as we want to keep growing in the face of robust demand, which is also the reason why our margins have taken a hit. But will it sustain? I don't think it will.

Every passing day, you're onboarding more and more people at the bottom of the pyramid and they will start gaining experience. So once they form a part of the experienced pool, which will happen after one year, you have many more people who are available in the market.

So these mad increases of 40 percent, 50 percent, 100 percent – those scenarios will reduce and normalcy will definitely come. But I think in the short term, it’s inevitable because of the supply chain problem and gaps that are there. Wages will be higher.

HCL Tech started operations in Sri Lanka two years ago. With Sri Lanka in turmoil, how are you tracking and responding to the situation?

I’m monitoring the crisis in Sri Lanka on a daily basis. We have a crisis management team that takes stock of the situation. We have a total population of around 1,700 employees in the country, out of which about 110 are Indian... Apart from those 110, we took visas for 250 Sri Lankans as well. In case there is a serious disruption, the deliverables will happen from India.

Largely, there are three problems in Sri Lanka that we continue to face – one is a disruption in terms of diesel causing issues of power backup, the second is inflation, and the third is political instability.

However, there is no disruption to work, thankfully, at this point in time. The employees are working from home like in India. With Indian intervention, the 13-hour power cuts earlier, even in places like Colombo, have now come down to two, two and a half hours. If there is a power problem, we have two offices there which can run continuously for 30 days with the diesel backup.

We have also implemented a formula through which people’s salaries get adjusted to inflation and for expats, the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee is also accounted for. So financially, there is no issue for people as we are adjusting to these parameters.

However, if we have disruption, we will invoke business continuity and bring the necessary people to India. Currently, the Indian teams are helping them, but if this continues, scaling up will probably become an issue.

Talking about India, has the company started calling people back to the office after the government started easing down on restrictions?

Again, there are three parameters that govern such decisions. Number one, if there is a regulation, then we have to follow it. For example, we have already got notices from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka governments saying that people must come back to the office because we are working from SEZs (special economic zones). So, if they don't give relaxation to us, we have no choice.

Secondly, assuming that the government gives relaxation but a particular customer wants the team to work from the office only because of data privacy or infrastructure availability reasons, then again we have no choice.

The third aspect is dependency on labs. For example, within engineering and R&D services, there is a huge dependency on labs. Those people, in any case, are coming to office. We currently have 12 to 15 percent working from offices.

We give flexibility to teams on work-from-home kind of roles. We don’t mind them working permanently from home. In the long term, we are pivoting towards a virtual hybrid model. That is the direction and policy."

The overall demand environment continues to be robust despite uncertainty and macro-economic challenges, Roshni Nadar Malhotra, chairperson of India's third-largest software firm HCL Technologies said, in a rare media interaction in Mumbai.

Nadar-Malhotra, the first woman chairperson of a top Indian IT firm, has usually stayed away from the press and operations, preferring to drive philanthropic initiatives. She broke the pattern on May 12, chairing a press conference with CEO C Vijayakumar.

“The last couple years have been unpredictable due to COVID-19, but we still witness robust demand,” she said. Vijayakumar said that while factors such as inflation are a worry, clients haven’t spoken about reducing spends, just yet.

Talking about the company's growth potential, Nadar-Malhotra said their utmost priority has been to accelerate digital transformation programmes with efficiency. On acquisitions, she said that while the focus has been on organic growth, they would look into tuck-in and specialised acquisitions that give the company domain expertise and strength in newer business lines.

In its recent earnings report last month, HCL Tech posted revenues that beat estimates but a 110 basis point (bps) sequential fall in margin had disappointed the street. While it has given a FY23 growth guidance of 12-14 percent, it expects to grow margins by 18-20 percent.

“Since Vijay (CEO CVK) said that we can keep growing at double-digits, I guess we can keep growing at double-digits, no pressure,” she quipped.

“Five years from now, I think as a set goal we will continue growing in many more geographies. We probably will get many more customers. Our business lines will grow faster as well,” she said, laying down a five-year vision for the firm, at a time when outsourcing demand has gone up as more companies migrate to the cloud and digitise operations.

In addition, the company has invested in expanding to newer geographies such as Central America, Eastern Europe, and Canada, among others. Nadar-Malhotra said, “A lot of our choices on these new frontier countries for delivery are based on talent availability, driven by customer demand, and the markets where we are more strategically focused.”

In 2020, Roshni Nadar Malhotra became the first woman chairperson to head a top Indian IT company when she took charge on July 17. She took over the role from her father Shiv Nadar, who co-founded the parent company, HCL, back in 1976.

While new to the role of chair, Nadar-Malhotra is definitely not new to the company. She said, “I have been on the board since 2012 and the CEO of the holding company since 2009. So, I’m not new to the block.”

However, she only started playing an active role in the management of the firm in 2020, as per industry watchers. Earlier, she was the CEO and Executive Director of HCL Corporation and also Vice-Chairperson on the Board since 2018.

Nadar-Malhotra grew up in Delhi and graduated with an MBA from Kellogg. She has been focused on the philanthropy side, where apart from serving as a trustee on the Shiv Nadar Foundation, she is also chairperson of VidyaGyan Leadership Academy, which provides education to underprivileged children.

Last year, C Vijayakumar, CEO, was given additional charge as Managing Director of the company. According to him, HCL Tech has touched the highest revenue on a five-year basis and maintained attrition at 7 percent in the top 500 management level.

He said, “We are confident of continuing to deliver industry-leading growth. HCL has a broad range of digital capabilities, and going forward, it is looking at the highest percentage spend on cloud and digital operations of about 51 percent by FY25.”

Vijayakumar also added that HCL has been leading among competitors with the highest total shareholder return."

Indian IT stocks fell even as the rupee hit an all-time low as larger concerns weighed on them.

All the top IT stocks ended lower on Tuesday. Infosys dropped 1.1 percent, Tata Consultancy Services lost 0.2 percent, HCL Technologies lost 0.3 percent and Wipro declined 1.14 percent on the National Stock Exchange on May 10. The Nifty IT index fell 1 percent.

The Nifty IT index has slipped 3% in May so far. Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro, and HCL Tech have lost 7-19 percent in this period.

So far this year, the Nifty IT Index has fallen 21 percent, while the rupee has declined about 4 percent. Infosys, TCS, Wipro, and HCL Tech lost between 7 and 33 percent this year.

Technology investors typically cheer a weakening rupee, which increases earnings when dollar revenue is converted into the local currency. Every 1 percent depreciation in the rupee boosts the margins of IT companies by 14-40 basis points, analysts said.

In the March quarter, dollar revenue at TCS grew 14.3 percent in constant currency terms from a year earlier to $6.7 billion, while that of Infosys increased 20.6 percent to $4.3 billion. Wipro’s dollar revenue grew 3.1 percent sequentially to $2.72 billion.

According to ICRA, TCS, Wipro, HCL, Tech Mahindra and Infosys reported a good performance in the fourth quarter of FY22. There has been some moderation in operating margins over the past few quarters, driven by wage cost inflation on the back of demand-supply gaps and high attrition levels, and also due to normalisation of operational overheads with the resumption of work-from-office to a large extent. However, overall profitability and accrual generation has remained healthy.

Contract deferrals

“Global macroeconomic factors including uncertainty related to the ongoing geopolitical issues between Russia and Ukraine are likely to have some impact on IT services companies with considerable presence in Eastern Europe,” said Deepak Jotwani, assistant vice president & sector head - corporate ratings at ICRA.

“However, the overall impact on the industry performance is not expected to be significant. While there could be slight deferrals in contract awards/IT investments in select geographies, overall technology spend is likely to remain healthy across key geographies.”

Analysts expect Indian IT service companies to report steady growth of 10-12 percent over FY23 and FY24, supported by accelerated demand for digitisation globally. However margin pressure is likely to sustain over the near term, although abated to some extent by increasing operational efficiencies.

Volatility in the global markets amid higher inflation and expectations of tightening by central banks along with the Russia-Ukraine war, which is unlikely to end soon, may see a slowdown in order books. Most Indian IT companies are moving their operations out of Russia while helping clients maintain business continuity by shifting work to other locations. This is likely to increase margin pressures further, analysts said.

“Monetary tightening by the Reserve Bank of India or the US Federal Reserve will have a negative effect on IT services top line and margins only if it results in a sharp slowdown in economic activity or a recession,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities. “IT projects cannot be postponed by businesses if they want to maintain their edge against competitors. However, in times of a sharp slowdown or recession, businesses across the board could postpone such spends.”

According to Ajit Mishra, VP of research at Religare Broking, broadly, the IT results in the March quarter were mixed – the order pipeline stood strong while margins were a bit impacted due to high attrition and employee costs. Besides, a sharp fall in global IT majors adds to the pressure. However, Religare’s long-term view on the IT sector is still positive, given the strong order pipeline and continuous demand for cloud and digitalisation across verticals."

Top three IT majors – TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech – made a net addition of 1.97 lakh employees for the year ending March 2022. The companies also added 2.08 lakh freshers for the year, and will be taking in 1.35 lakh campus hires this financial year.

This comes on the back of rising attrition even as demand continues to be robust. Moreover, with lateral talents coming at a huge cost, the companies are bridging the demand-supply gap by hiring more freshers.

According to experts and executives, attrition is likely to increase before it moderates in the second half this financial year.

Rising attrition

Spiking attrition rate has been a concern for IT companies.

TCS attrition increased to 17.4 percent in the March 2022 quarter from 8.6 percent in the beginning of the year and 11.9 percent in the December 2021 quarter. Infosys reported 27.7 percent in attrition for the March 2022 quarter, up from 13.9 percent at the beginning of the year.

In case of HCL Tech, attrition increased from 11.8 percent at the beginning of the year to 21.8 percent in the March 2022 quarter. Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive of TCS, said that the attrition numbers are likely to get worse before they moderate.

According to Infosys finance chief Nilanjan Roy, attrition should come down in the following year as more freshers come into the pipeline.

However, the increasing cost of talent is resulting in IT firms hiring more freshers in FY22, a trend that is likely to continue in FY23. TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech added 103546, 54396 and 39900 people last fiscal, respectively.

Fresher hiring

The top three IT firms consistently ramped up fresher supply from their initial estimates. For instance, TCS and Infosys hired 100,000 and 85,000 respectively against their initial estimates of 40,000 and 26,000 at the beginning of the fiscal.

For HCL Tech, the 23,000 freshers the firm hired was more than the 12,000 hired in the previous year.

In FY23, these companies will be hiring 1.35 lakh from campuses, and this number could increase.

TCS’ Gopinathan said, “The expectation is that the bulk of this hiring that has gone on across the industry in the last calendar year will start coming in and playing a role. So, it’s very similar to what you are saying; just that there is a little bit of a lag and by the middle of the year we should see it.”

He added that fresher hiring and productive use of freshers is a long cycle activity. “But you have seen the industry step up hiring over the last four quarters. We expect that as supply hits productive use it will ease up a lot of what was going on over the last few quarters.”

Roy said, “Volume has to be through freshers, there is no other source of volume. Therefore, we start pumping in more freshers, send them for training, put them into the bench and then get them into production. I think that cycle takes time, and you are already seeing the benefits of this – not only with us but also seeing that with the industry as well.”

In case of HCL Tech, apart from increasing the fresher supply to 45,000 in FY23, the company is also tapping into talents in other regions. It also expects the talent situation to stabilise by the second half of FY23.

During the earnings call on April 21, C Vijayakumar, chief executive of HCL Tech, said that it is also looking to tap the US and Asia Pacific for talents apart from India."

Emkay Global Financial's report on HCL Tech

HCLT delivered broadly in line operating performance in Q4. Revenue grew 0.5% QoQ to USD2.99bn (1.1% CC) on the back of continued traction in Services (5% CC). Products & Platforms declined 24% CC due to seasonality. EBITM declined by 110bps to 17.9%. It signed 6 large services and 4 product deals across technology & services, life sciences & healthcare and public services verticals for a total new deal TCV of USD2.3bn (6% QoQ). Broad-based demand, robust deal intake and pipeline augur well for revenue acceleration. HCLT has guided for revenue growth of 12-14% CC in FY23 on the back of continued traction in the services business, healthy deal intake and deal pipeline (close to all time high). It has guided for 18-20% EBITM guidance for FY23, considering supply-side challenges and planned investments in Mode 2 capabilities and markets.



Outlook

We cut FY23/FY24 EPS estimates by 3%/2.7%, factoring in Q4 performance and FY23 guidance. Revenue growth momentum is encouraging; however, pressure on Services margin led to earnings cut. We maintain Buy with a TP of Rs1,400 at 22x Mar'24E EPS considering attractive valuations, steady cash generation and ~4% dividend yield.

Sri Lanka’s economic crisis is unlikely to have a significant impact on IT players such as HCL Tech and Virtusa, as the island nation’s contribution to the industry is modest and companies can look for other low-cost locations, experts have said.

Sri Lanka is facing an unprecedented economic crisis, with soaring inflation, fuel shortages and power cuts. The rising cost of living has triggered country-wide protests, with demand growing for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who comes from the powerful Rajapaksa clan, to step down.

Rajapaksa was forced to revoke the state of emergency he declared on April 1 as anger spilled onto the streets.

Sri Lanka as an IT destination

For Sri Lanka, the information technology-business process management (IT-BPM) industry has been a priority sector for economic development.

A 2021 report by Sri Lanka Association for Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM), the country’s IT body, the BPM industry generated $345 million and had over 80 companies across industries and service lines.

The IT-BPM industry would generate export revenues of $1 billion and create a workforce of 50,000 by 2025, up from 25,000 at the end of 2019, it said.

In the last few years, IT firms like HCL Tech have been stepping up their presence in the country. The company entered Sri Lanka in 2020 and has, so far, hired more than 1,000 people.

Virtusa and BPM companies like WNS and Genpact are among the other IT players in the island nation.

The now US-headquartered Virtusa was founded in Sri Lanka in 1996 by Kris Canekeratne, Tushara Canekeratne, John Gillis and Sandy Gillis. It was acquired by private equity firm Baring PE Asia in 2021 for $2 billion.

Despite these efforts, Sri Lanka is not huge for IT services firms, experts said.

Mrinal Rai, principal analyst, ISG, said, “Sri Lankan IT outsourcing deals were less than 50 million $ in 2020-21. Local providers specialise more in business process outsourcing or web/app development work than in modern digital technologies.”

Sri Lanka has around 30,000 IT-BPS FTEs. In comparison, East Europe has approximately 1.5 million, said Chirajeet Sengupta, Partner, Everest Group, a research and advisory firm.

As a result, the ongoing crisis was unlikely to have a significant impact, experts said.

Moneycontrol reached out to HCL Tech, Virtusa, WNS and Genpact on the impact the crisis would have on their operations and employees but had not heard from them until the time of writing this copy.

The fallout of the crisis

“Companies like HCL are unlikely to be meaningfully impacted, and as of now, we haven’t heard anything to the contrary,” Everest’s Sengupta said.

Rai of ISG said local providers specialised more in business process outsourcing or web/app development work than in modern digital technologies.

“Some providers such as HCL and Virtusa have some presence in the region but otherwise there are few delivery centres,” Rai said.

Though there is not a huge dependency on the region, clients and large providers that depend on Sri Lanka for service delivery would look for other low-cost locations for cost optimisation, he added.

With clients comfortable with remote working models, companies would also be able to move delivery far more seamlessly than in the past, experts said.

This, however, could change if the situation worsens. Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder, Everest group said, “If the supply chain is disrupted further, this would contribute to the global shortage of IT and engineering skills and will further fuel wage inflation in India and other global markets.”

The impact on HCL and other Indian-centric players would likely be modest as their presence in Sri Lanka was limited compared to their other global delivery centres and their overall performance would not be hit even if the situation worsens to the point “they have to close operations. I stress they are not at this point at this time”, he said."

The recent spike in oil prices due to the Ukraine conflict may put pressure on the cement industry's operational costs, a top company executive has said.

Anil Singhvi, chairman, Shree Digvijay Cement, and C Vijayakumar, CEO & MD, HCL Tech, spoke with CNBC-TV18 on the stock market price action, and whether operating expenditures have increased due to supply chain concerns over the Russia-Ukraine war.

Singhvi pointed out that the rise in oil prices might take a toll on the industry's operational costs.

Stressing that demand has been lower than expectations, Singhvi said his company is not much concerned now as it has inventories. He also added that it would be a difficult Q4 for the industry as prices have been stable when costs have increased.

""Not concerned about elevated prices at the moment because cement sector is a long-term play. Most of us carry inventory because things may go haywire anytime. This quarter will be slightly difficult because demand has been low. Prices have been stable when costs have increased. The markets today are far more nervous than the cement industry,"" he said.

Commenting on the risk of rising input costs impacting the earnings of companies, Singhvi said the next few weeks will be testing time for the cement industry. He also said an assessment could be done on how costs are impacting their prices after a fortnight.

Russia-Ukraine War LIVE Updates

""We have to wait for more than 15 days to calculate how costs are increasing. We have to assess whether rising prices can be passed or not. Crude at $130 is definitely not good. These energy shocks come once in 15 years in some forms. We have to look at when the war is going to stop. This is an abnormal time. Next 15 days are crucial,"" Singhvi observed.

When asked whether Indian exports which stood at $180 billion in the current year could rise to $300 billion in five years, Vijayakumar of HCL Tech said, ""Given the buoyancy we are seeing, in the next five years potentially we would reach that. We are already seeing that kind of momentum across sectors and for most of the industries.""

On concerns about employee costs for IT companies, he said, ""It is difficult to retain good talent and continue to upskill them to get better quality of work from them. The focus has been to acquire talent in the industry, whether it is from campuses, or from multiple locations across the globe. The ability to adapt to newer technologies is much faster."""

Over 18,600 people, including more than 2,900 healthcare workers, were given the 'precaution' dose of COVID-19 vaccine in Delhi on Monday, according to government data. As many as 6,439 people aged above 60 and 9,252 frontline workers were also administered the third dose in the city, data on the CoWIN app showed.

People aged 60 and above, healthcare and frontline workers who took their second dose of vaccine nine months ago are eligible for the 'precaution' dose. According to the CoWIN app, 18,669 people got their 'precaution' dose of COVID-19 vaccine in Delhi on Monday.

Beneficiaries are being administered 'precaution' dose of the same vaccine they took 39 weeks ago. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on December 24 announced 'precaution' shots for vulnerable populations and those at higher risk of contracting COVID-19.

On January 3, the Centre had rolled out vaccinations for adolescents aged between 15 and 17. So far, over 5.6 lakh beneficiaries in this age group have received their first dose of Covid vaccine in Delhi, the data showed.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

On Monday, over 48,000 beneficiaries in the 15-17 age group received their first dose, it stated. According to government data, over 2.85 crore Covid vaccine doses have been administered in Delhi since the inoculation exercise started on January 16 last year. As many as 1.19 crore people have received both doses."

Shares of IT major HCL Tech dropped by nearly six percent on January 17, in the first session following the release of its Q3 results. The company's share valued at Rs 1,258.75 at closing hours, which marked a plunge of 5.87 percent.

The stock hit a low of Rs 1,255.10 on the BSE, down 6 percent, intraday.

The Q3 numbers, released by HCL Tech on January 14, were largely in line with the expectations. Brokerages, however, raised concern towards the weak margin outlook. In terms of revenue, the company clocked an 8 percent sequential growth at Rs 22,331 crore, whereas, profit grew 5.4 percent QoQ to Rs 3,442 crore.

Here's what brokerages have to say:

Credit Suisse

The brokerage has an ‘outperform’ call on the IT stock and has raised its target price to Rs 1,650 from Rs 1,450. The IT company reported solid revenue growth but margin performance was disappointing, it said. The brokerage believes HCL Tech is well-positioned for a stronger FY23 and has a positive view on the stock because valuations are relatively attractive. Baking in Q3 results, Credit Suisse has increased EPS estimates for FY22-24 by 1-8 percent.

CLSA

The brokerage has an ‘outperform’ rating on the stock but has cut its target price to Rs 1,450 from Rs 1,470. Even as the revenue growth and deal momentum is strong, the margin outlook appears weak, CLSA noted. The brokerage has cut EPS estimates for FY23 and FY24 by 2 percent each. However, improved revenue growth visibility and attractive valuation and capital allocation have kept the brokerage engaged. CLSA said that the near-term prognosis for HCL Tech is weak as its margin could weigh on the stock performance.

Morgan Stanley

While raising the target price on the IT company’s stock to Rs 1,450 from Rs 1,360, the brokerage has maintained its ‘equal-weight’ call on HCL Tech’s shares. The brokerage believes that the lack of positive revisions to product revenue guidance has to some extent offset the solid revenue performance. Sustainable re-rating will wait until clarity emerges in Q4, on the margin front, Morgan Stanley pointed out.

Nomura

The brokerage has a ‘buy’ call on HCL Tech’s shares and raised its target price to Rs 1,580. Nomura noted that revenue surprised positively but margin performance was weaker than expected. Deal wins were healthy which sets the stage for strong growth, the brokerage said raising FY22-24 EPS estimate By 0.2-1.6 percent mainly led by higher revenue estimates.

JP Morgan

HCL Tech's growth has taken off but margin trade-off needs watching, according to the brokerage. JP Morgan has maintained its 'overweight' rating on shares of HCL Tech and hiked its target price to Rs 1,500 from Rs 1,400 while upgrading its revenue estimate by 1-3 percent. The brokerage cut margin by 20-60 bps and trimmed EPS estimates by 1-3 percent for FY22-24.

UBS

The brokerage has a 'sell' call on HCL Tech shares. UBS believes strong beat and total contract value wins could be offset by lack of assurance on FY23.

Citi

With a ‘neutral’ rating and cut in target price to Rs 1,385 from Rs 1,400 and trimming of FY23-24 estimates, Citi said products or platforms and margin outlook needs to be closely watched. The brokerage noted that the IT company reported a largely in-line quarter on the EBIT front."

Shares of HCL Technologies Ltd declined nearly 6 percent on Monday after the company reported lower-than-expected earnings before interest and taxes and reduced lower-end margins guidance by its management.

The stock hit a low of Rs 1,255.10 on the BSE, down 6 percent, intraday. At 9.17am, it was trading at Rs 1,276 on the BSE, down 4.6 percent from its previous close.

EBIT margin for the quarter stood at 19 percent which was lower than what analysts had projected. This was impacted due to a 220 basis points on-quarter decline in IT services and 70 basis points QoQ fall in engineering R&D.

The management reiterated its double-digit dollar revenue growth guidance (including P&P growth of 0-1 percent YoY), but reduced its margin guidance to the lower end of 19-21 percent band (with a 10-20bp downside buffer). Its attrition rate for the quarter increased to 19.8 percent from 15.7 percent a quarter ago.

HCL Tech added 10,143 employees in the last quarter and the total headcount is now at 1,97,777.

Also Read:-HCL Tech to double fresher hiring in FY23 from 20,000 this fiscal

Analysts say that the management was cautious on the near-term margin outlook due to continued talent crunch and high costs to backfill attrition and transition costs in large deals. This could cause fourth quarter FY22 EBIT margin to drop to as low as 18 percent.

""The margin outlook on IT services was below our estimate as HCLT continues to struggle to absorb the impact of an adverse supply scenario. While it will be raising prices across accounts, we expect margin to stay at the lower end of its current guidance for FY23 before recovering in FY24,"" according to Motilal Oswal Research note.

HCL Tech reported a dollar revenue growth of 7.6 percent sequentially in constant currency to $2.97 billion for the December quarter, the fastest in almost 12 years. The record revenue was boosted by new deal wins and acceleration in clients’ digital spending.

It posted a net profit of Rs 3,442 crore in the quarter, a decline of 13.6 percent from a year earlier. The decline in profit was due to a one-time gain of lower tax expense last year in the same quarter. Revenue rose 15.7 percent from a year ago to Rs 22,331 crore.

The company also reported strong total contract value (TCV) of new deal wins worth $2.13 billion, a 64 percent increase over the same quarter last year.

Analysts say that the trend of fastest growth to continue in the coming quarter as a robust TCV points towards strong impending growth cycle

""Going forward, we expect the company to report healthy growth in IT services revenues mainly led by healthy deal wins. This coupled with strong client addition and net addition of 10,143 bodes well for revenue growth. In addition, we believe that with improvement in product business we expect margins to improve in coming quarters.

Noida-based IT Services firm HCL Technologies will double its fresher hiring in FY23 as the demand for technology services continues to outstrip supply, and rising attrition.

The company will hire 20,000-22,000 freshers in FY22. So far 17,500 freshers have been on-boarded and the rest will join the company in the fourth quarter. The firm employs about 1.97 lakh employees.

Between January and December 2021, the company hired 38,095 people, of which 10,143 were added in the October to December quarter alone.

At 19.8 percent attrition is a huge concern for the firm. HCL Tech reported 15.7 percent in Q2 FY22, from 11.8 percent in the last quarter. During the earnings call on January 14, VV Apparao, Chief Human Resources officer, HCL Tech, said that while the overall attrition is high, it is 12.3 percent at the junior and senior leadership level.

To contain attrition, the company is taking several measures to address the issue. Last quarter, it announced stock options for senior hires, in addition to the salary hikes effective July 1, and 100 percent quarterly bonus for junior management. This is in a bid to address rising attrition and build the supply chain, even as the demand remains robust.







The company has also identified 600 people to be trained as next generation leaders, and charter a career path in the firm. Reskilling is another area of focus, where the company is now able to fulfil 40 percent of the new roles coming in internally.





Return to office

With vaccination gaining pace, the company saw 5-6 percent of its staff returning to offices in the second quarter. However, with the number of cases increasing, the number of employees coming to office is at 3 percent.

IT services major HCL Technologies has revoked the policy to recover the bonus paid to employees when they quit the firm in the middle of the year.

This comes after multiple complaints from employees, some of whom approached IT employees union, and wanted the firm to revoke the policy, and also recover the bonus deducted by HCL Technologies.

""During the pandemic, beginning last year, the organisation decided to waive off all the performance conditions attached to this component and pay 100 percent in advance to reward the employees. This advance variable payout (much like standard sign-on bonus terms and conditions) would be deducted if any employee left ahead of the completion of the performance review cycle, in the final settlement. Going forward, we will continue with the advance variable payout for our employees and have also waived off the recoveries w.e.f December 22, 2021,” the company spokesperson said in a statement.

The company further explained that all the junior management employees were paid the variable pay in advance as a supplement to their fixed salary, and this is clearly stated in the terms of payment.

This comes at a time, when companies are seeing high attrition rates, even as the demand for technology services continue unabated resulting in record hiring.

What happened?

Employees, who were exiting the firm, noticed a new clause that stated that bonus paid to the employees who are exiting the company between September 2021 and March 2022, will be recovered in full. Moneycontrol has reviewed the copy of the mail with the clause about recovering the bonuses.

On January 7, a complaint was filed with the Ministry for Labour and Employment.

Harpreet Saluja, President, Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES), a union for IT employees, said, “Payment of bonus is the statutory liability on the employer and receipt of bonus amount is the legal right of the employee and the amount to be paid, to whom to be paid and by when to be paid has been well framed in the Payment of Bonus Act. The employer cannot unethically amend the bonus scheme depriving bonus to its employees. The employees who resigned from the service also are entitled to a bonus for their tenure.”

Few days after the complaint was filed, the company has said that this clause has now been revoked.

HCL Tech revokes the clause

In the latest policy document that Moneycontrol viewed, the new clause about the recovery of the bonus for employees who are exiting the company between September 2021 and March 2022 was absent.

Saluja said that while the company has now revoked the policy, it is only for the Engagement Performance Bonus, a variable component that is paid to the employees on a monthly basis. Advance Monthly Performance Bonus, which will be recovered from employees, has not been revoked.

“We are in process of filing a court case against HCL Technologies against illegal bonus recovery policy and for refund of the bonus amount deducted to all employees,” Saluja said."

“Sustainable demand momentum for Cloud and Digital Engineering benefits HCL Tech,” Motilal Oswal said. “Strong headcount additions and deal wins reflect the management’s confidence on a sustainable growth momentum. We continue to see potential in the company’s Products and Platforms business.”

HCL Technologies shares traded at Rs 1,123.95, down Rs 29.45, or 2.55 percent at 13:40 hours. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 1,155 and an intraday low of Rs 1,113.85.

The scrip was trading with volumes of 280,042 shares, compared to its five day average of 116,008 shares, an increase of 141.40 percent.

India’s top IT companies reported one of their best quarters in the three months ended September and are on track to register double-digit growth for the year as demand for digital services continues to rise. The pipeline for contracts was strong in the quarter, although mega-deals were missing.

HCL Technologies won contracts valued at $2.3 billion. The bulk of the deal pipeline was in the range of $50 million to $200 million, HCL Tech CEO C Vijayakumar said on an earnings call in October.

On a combined basis, Motilal Oswal said HCL Tech should deliver dollar revenue growth of 13.1 percent over FY21-23E. The EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin should stabilise at 20 percent in FY23E, which should help it deliver 14.3 percent PAT (profit after tax) CAGR (compound annual growth rate) over FY21-23E.

Motilal Oswal maintained its ‘buy’ rating on the HCL stock, expecting traction in the services business in H2 FY22E and FY23E.

The tech company said on November 16 it signed a multi-year application deal with Euroclear Group to improve its digital capabilities. HCL will work with Euroclear, the world’s largest provider of domestic and cross-border settlement and related services for bond, equity and fund transactions, to explore new business models and market opportunities to create value through innovation and data monetisation. HCL will modernise Euroclear’s digital channel landscape, HCL Tech said in an exchange filing.

HCL Technologies has announced its apprenticeship programme in the US, focused on hiring high school graduates for full-time technology jobs that would otherwise be inaccessible.

Upon successfully completing the program, apprentices will be offered full-time employment at HCL Technologies and have the opportunity to concurrently pursue a debt-free college education, a statement on late Wednesday said.

HCL’s apprenticeship programme provides full pay and benefits, enabling candidates to begin their technology career in software development and testing, digital and cloud services, infrastructure delivery and engineering — with positions available at multiple global innovation and delivery centers in California, Connecticut, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas, it added.

The HCL Apprenticeship is part of Rise at HCL, the company’s North American early career and training programme.

Applications for the first apprenticeships in Frisco, Texas, and Cary, North Carolina, already open. At HCL, we understand how vital it is to invest in tomorrow’s technology leaders, and we are thrilled to create opportunities for our apprentices to grow their careers at HCL, HCL Technologies Executive Vice President Ramachandran Sundarajan said.

This programme furthers the company’s pledge to hire and train the nation’s next generation of skilled technology talent while freeing them from the burden of education debt, Sundarajan added.

Participants will enroll in their choice of an associate or bachelor’s degree program in STEM to be fully funded by HCL at a college or university that is part of HCL’s nationwide academic partner network.

A key partner for the program is Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), a private, non-profit institution and leader in online education that offers more than 200 accredited degree programs.

The HCL Apprenticeship Program complements HCL’s existing internships and graduate hiring commitments across the globe, particularly in the US, where HCL has had a significant presence for nearly three decades. The US is the largest market for HCL, contributing more than 60 per cent of total company revenue."
"November 08, 2021 10:57 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hcl-software-head-darren-oberst-quits-the-firm-7688841.html,"Darren Oberst, head of HCL Software, which accounts for about 12 percent of revenue, has quit the firm to pursue other opportunities.

Oberst joined HCL in 2014 as the head of corporate development and moved to lead this group in 2016.

“Interim leadership will take over this week, and in parallel, the Company will interview candidates internally and externally to lead this business segment. With the change, HCL also plans to align its entire suite of products and platforms allowing for greater synergies,” the company said in a statement.

HCL Software includes select IBM products that the company acquired in 2018 for $1.8 billion and is one of the key focus areas for the company. The segment growth declined in the last quarter by 8 percent sequentially due to some delay in deal closures.

C Vijayakumar, CEO, HCL Tech, said during the earnings call last month, “There was a blip that can be attributed to delays in closing some large deals, which is likely to be done in the next quarter. Usually, the product business has a lot of licence sales of our products and a big part of our revenue gets booked and recognised towards the end of the quarter. I want to assure you the core of this business is intact, though we overall expect this year to be flat to one person growth compared to the low single-digit growth that we had shared earlier,”

During a recent interaction with Moneycontrol, Vijayakumar, said, “If you look at the products and platforms business, a large part of it is what we had acquired from IBM. Now, there are a lot of puts and takes when you do a big divestiture. This includes some one-time revenue, some settlements and things like that. So, I think if you do this comparison, it’s kind of declining for the last two-three quarters. For the full year, we have already said that it would be in low single digits, but we are looking at flat to 1 percent growth. Many products have very strong growth products in this portfolio. So, we remain confident. If you move into the next year, we are optimistic about the business trajectory here."""

Top five IT services companies – TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra – together added close to 1.7 lakh people in the first nine months of this year on the back of strong demand and rising attrition.

The recovery is all the more striking, since it comes after headcount in the top five IT firms declined by 1,125 during the same period last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Back in March 2020, countries went into lockdown and IT firms paused hiring, both freshers and laterals, as they braced for volatility. The top five companies’ headcount addition was 77,000 between January and September 2019.

A year later, there is a complete turnaround, in terms of both hiring and the demand.

Hiring and demand

Demand is at an all-time high and supply chain constraint is a key challenge across the industry.

For one, attrition has gone up across the industries. Infosys, Wipro and Tech Mahindra reported attrition rate of over 20 percent for the quarter ended September 2021, up from the previous quarters. Saurabh Govil, chief human resources officer, Wipro, said during the earnings call on October 13 that the high attrition rate is likely for the next couple of quarters, given that the market is hot right now.

It is not just large IT services companies that are looking at a spike in attrition rates, mid-tier IT companies and also clients are in the same predicament.

Sanjay Jalona, CEO, L&T Infotech, in a recent interaction with Moneycontrol, said, “In what the world is calling a ‘Great Resignation’, the US itself has a million openings. Unemployment is only at 7.5 percent. So, the deficit in talent availability is causing them to have huge attrition.”

He further explained, “Our customers are seeing double-digit attrition numbers and they’re looking to partners like us. They are also automating a lot of things because of the shortage of labour. All these three things put together are creating a need for more tech services and jobs. We are just happy to be here participating in this with our customers.” LTI reported an attrition rate of 19.6 percent.

So the companies are hiring in large numbers to cater to the clients’ needs.

Spike in hiring

Hiring, without a doubt, is at an all-time high in recent years and the outlook for the next two quarters looks strong. In the quarter ending September 2021 alone, the top five IT majors added close to 70,000 people. It was 18,000 last year and 37,000 for the quarter ended September 2019.

Most of the IT firms have revised their fresher hiring targets for the year given the sustained demand. TCS increased their fresher hiring numbers from 40,000 it had announced early this year to 78,000 for FY22. Infosys will hire 45,000 freshers this fiscal, up from 26,000 it had announced in the beginning of this fiscal. Wipro will hire 17,000 freshers up from 12,000 it had earlier announced.

This would take total fresher hiring to 1.6 lakh in FY22.

With the momentum expected to continue, some firms have announced they will be doubling their fresher hiring in FY23 as well. Wipro and HCL Tech said they would be hiring 25,000-30,000 freshers in FY23."

For Wipro Limited, the past year has been something of a landmark. The Bengaluru-based information technology (IT) company finally caught up with the industry’s double-digit growth rate and passed a key milestone: $10 billion in annual revenue run rate.

Wipro during the earnings call on October 13 announced that it has crossed the $10 billion revenue run rate for the last 12 months ended September 2021. It logged $2.4 billion in incremental revenue in 12 months, bridging the gap with HCL Technologies Limited, which two years ago had supplanted it as India’s third-biggest IT company. In the 12 months ended September 2021, HCL Tech posted $10.8 billion in revenue.

Wipro’s stellar performance came on the heels of Thierry Delaporte, a 27-year veteran of the IT services industry who previously worked in Capgemini SA, taking over as managing director and chief executive officer on July 6, 2020, as the company reorganised its leadership ranks.

With the Frenchman at the helm, can Wipro wrest back its place as the No. 3 IT company in India, just behind Tata Consultancy Services Limited and Infosys Limited?.

“Under Thierry's leadership, Wipro is finally making its long awaited comeback, the sales momentum which has been demonstrated over the last few quarters looks like it will continue,” said Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO of Everest Group, a research and advisory firm.

Before Delaporte came on board, Wipro lagged its peers on the growth front. Its revenue grew at a much slower pace, enabling Noida-based HCL Tech to overcome it.

After posting 19% revenue growth in the financial year 2011 to $5.2 billion and 13,4% to $5.9 billion the following year, Wipro’s pace began to flag, dropping to a single-digit rate.

Not the first time

HCL Tech wasn’t the first company to knock Wipro off its perch in the IT pantheon. In the early 2000s, Infosys had overtaken the company to become India’s second-largest IT services provider; in the 2002 financial year, Infosys posted Rs.2,603 crore in revenue compared to Rs. 2,300 crore earned by Wipro.

The gap widened in financial year 2012 to $1 billion and to 5.4 billion in 2021, when Infosys posted $13.5 billion in revenue compared to Wipro’s $8.1 billion.

Wipro was $1.8 billion ahead of HCL Tech in revenue terms in financial year 2010. In a decade, the tables had turned. In financial year 2019, HCL posted sales of $8.6 billion to $8.1 billion for Wipro. In financial year 2021, HCL Tech’s revenue grew 2.4% to $10.18 billion. Wipro’s declined 1.4% to $8.14 billion.

How did Delaporte pull off the feat of narrowing the gap in the last financial year?

The Frenchman put in place a new business model on January 1, scaling down 20 company units to four strategic business units based on geography and sector – Americas1, Americas2, Europe, and Asia Pacific Middle East and Africa (APMEA).

Restructuring

While the Americas are based on sectors, Europe and APMEA are based on geographies to drive growth from the regions where the company expects 58 percent om incremental revenue.

These units are to be aligned with two global business lines (GBLs) based on capabilities – iDEAS (Integrated Digital, Engineering & Application Services) and iCORE (Cloud Infrastructure, Digital Operations, Risk & Enterprise Cyber Security Services).

Delaporte also created a new role, chief growth officer, to drive large deals in Wipro which it had been missing out on. Wipro won a $700 million deal in December from German retailer Metro AG after acquiring its IT unit.

Acquisitions were a key part of the restructuring exercise. Over the last one year, Wipro made a string of acquisitions, the largest being London-based management and consulting firm Capco for $1.45 billion. Other acquisitions include Ampion, a company that’s engaged in cybersecurity, a key focus area for the company.

Wipro empowered its global account executives to strengthen relationships with customers in key geographies such as the US and Europe.

It is also on a talent acquisition spree. This financial year, the company plans to hire 17,000 freshers and 25,000-30,000 the following year. It is also focused on diversifying its leadership in terms of gender and ethnicity to keep the growth momentum going.

Advantage HCL Tech?

Wipro will bridge the revenue gap with HCL Tech this financial year, thanks to both organic and inorganic growth, said Apurva Prasad, vice president of institutional research at Elara Capital. The acquisition of Capco, which accounts for about 10 percent of revenue, has helped push growth.

The company grew 4.6 percent in constant currency terms excluding its acquisitions of Capco and Ampion. Constant Constant currency refers to a fixed exchange rate that eliminates fluctuations when calculating financial performance figures.

According to Ray Wang, Principal Analyst & Founder, Constellation Research, ""Thierry has put together a very strong team that’s growth focused, and client centric. These are the next leaders who get large deals and account, and they also understand how to sell across functional fiefdoms. The arrival of these senior sales leaders will make a difference.""

Still, some experts are betting on HCL Tech retaining its lead.

HCL Tech started the year on a weak note, hurt by a blip in its products and platforms (P&P) business, which declined 8 percent in the quarter ending September of this financial year. HCL Tech’s engineering, research and development (ER&D) business, which accounts for 16 percent of revenue, was hurt by the Covid-19 pandemic.

But P&P is expected to recover in coming quarters and momentum in ER&D is returning, growing 5.4 percent sequentially in the second quarter ending September 2021.

These are not the only reasons why analysts are betting on HCL Tech.

Omkar Tanksale, research analyst at Axis Securities, explained that barring the P&P business, HCL Tech’s IT services segment grew by a healthy 5.2 percent and had a robust deal pipeline of new deals at $2.3 billion between July and September 2021.

Hiring has been at an all-time high across the IT sector; for HCL Tech, the addition of 11,135 employees in the second quarter was a record.

In a research note, Motilal Oswal Securities said the hiring was a smart move and a safeguard against the current supply crunch.

“It also points to the management’s confidence in growth acceleration in the services business over the next few quarters, which should help usher revenue growth and employee productivity back to its historical levels,” the note added.

The company’s bet on a diversified portfolio will yield results in the long run, Tanksale said. Compared to its peers, HCL Tech has a higher presence in ER&D, and P&P, which account for 12 percent of its revenue.

“In my estimation, HCL Tech is expected to close FY23 with $12.7 billion revenue and Wipro $11.7 billion,” Elara Capital’s Prasad said

Even Bendor-Samuel of Everest Group said: “While HCL Tech had a relatively slow start to the year, it is likely to improve in coming months.”

Sizing each other up

On the competition with Wipro, HCL Tech’s CEO C Vijayakumar said:

“We are always competing with ourselves, not with others. We always want to do the best possible from our perspective.”

He added: “And right now, I think the market demand is very good. So, we are very focused on organic growth. There may be some small tuck-in acquisitions. So, that’s what we are doing and can’t comment on what others are doing.”

Asked if Wipro was set to overtake HCL Tech to regain its position as India’s third-largest IT services company, the usually candid Delaporte was circumspect about mentioning a timeframe.

“I’ve always been cautious about when it will happen. But I think we are progressing along the same line,” he said."

HCL Technologies on Monday announced the launch of its TechBee early career programme in Vietnam with plans to onboard 2,600 candidates in the next five years, starting this year.

Designed exclusively for high-school graduates, the TechBee programme prepares students technically and professionally for global IT careers in HCL Technologies, where candidates undergo an extensive 12-month training to become successful IT professionals and work for world-class global companies, a statement said.

Any local student who has successfully completed high school and holds a high school graduation certificate or its equivalent, can apply for the TechBee Program, it added. Enrolment in the program will take place through an entrance test. After the successful completion of the 12-month training program, the candidates will join HCL Vietnam and will be paid salary equivalent to the job roles.

HCL Vietnam strives to foster growth and train the nation's talent pool in collaboration with high schools and local ICT and engineering institutions. HCL began its business operations in Vietnam in July 2020. “Vietnam has great market potential and talent pool for global technology companies to harness. The program will give students an early start in high-tech career roles,'' HCL Technologies Corporate Vice President Sanjay Gupta said.

He added that with this programme, HCL aims to hire the best talent from the country and give them financial independence early in their lives. HCL started its TeeBee Program in India in 2017 with an aim to hire the best talent and enable them to achieve financial independence, and has been running successfully in India, Australia and Sri Lanka.

Till now, more than 3,000 students have completed the TechBee program and now work with HCL for its Fortune 500 and Global 2000 clients."

This comes on the back of increased demand for technology services and rising attrition.

Speaking to media persons after the company’s Q2 FY22 result announcement on October 14, Chief Human Resources Officer VV Apparao said that as the demand environment remains robust, the company will continue to hire laterals and freshers.

HCL Tech added close to 5,800 freshers in Q2 FY22 and will add about 10,000-12,000 freshers in the next two quarters. The firm employs about 1.87 lakh employees.

With attrition increasing to 15.7 percent from 11.8 percent in the last quarter, the company is taking several measures to address the issue. This includes stock options for senior hires, salary hikes effective July 1, and 100 percent quarterly bonus for junior management.

Rising attrition, incentives

To retain senior employees, the company’s board approved Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) grants as part of the compensation mix, as it looks to retain high performers amid the war for talent. This is a part of the company’s long term incentive plan.

Under this model, which was approved by the board on October 14, the company will move from 100 percent cash awards to a mix of 70 percent cash and 30 percent RSUs for the grants, which will be offered in the later year subject to shareholder approval.

In addition, the company also rolled out wage hikes, 7-8 percent for offshore employees and 3.5 percent for onsite hires. This came into effect for junior employees on July 1, 2021, and for senior executives, this will come into effect on October 1. Junior management will also be getting a 100 percent quarterly bonus for the quarter.

Return to work

As vaccination gains pace, close to 5-6 percent of employees are returning to office currently, which is expected to increase in the coming quarters.

Apparao explained, “We have encouraged our senior managers to come to office at least twice a week. Depending upon the rules, customer requirements, data, and privacy guidelines, each line of business is encouraging people to come at least once a week. So we do expect this momentum will increase by the end of this calendar year.”

Company performance

The company reported $2,791 million in revenues for Q2 FY22, up 2.6 percent sequentially and 11.3 percent year-on-year, driven by the manufacturing and life sciences segment. While the company did not offer guidance, it said that the IT services will see double-digit growth in FY22, considering the robust demand environment and the deal pipeline.

The company signed a $2.3 billion new booking for the quarter, a mixture of small and medium deals. However, the company’s product and platform segment reported a decline of 5.5 percent due to delay in closing large deals.

“There was a blip that can be attributed to delays in closing some large deals, which is likely to be done in the next quarter. Usually, the product business has a lot of licence sales of our products and a big part of our revenue gets booked and recognised towards the end of the quarter.

HCL Technologies on July 28 appointed Jill Kouri as the global chief marketing officer to drive the company’s digital agenda.

In her new role, Kouri, whose experience spans 30 years, will lead the company’s global marketing programmes to advance HCL’s focus on helping companies reimagine their business for the digital age.

“HCL is at a critical point in its journey, having reached the $10 billion revenue mark, and I am excited to lead the efforts to create more widespread brand awareness and affinity, all while driving a very strong growth agenda,” Kouri said in a statement.

In her previous role, she was the chief marketing officer for the real estate services firm JLL, Americas for seven years. Prior to that, she spent 14 years in senior marketing leadership roles at Accenture.

“As HCL continues to drive its strategy to be the digital partner of choice for global enterprises... it is imperative to strengthen our marketing leadership,” said C Vijayakumar, CEO and Managing Director, HCL Technologies. “Jill brings rich experience in areas from purpose articulation and global brand building to demand generation and sales enablement, and we are thrilled to welcome her to our leadership team,” he added.

The appointment of Kouri is in line with the broader trend of diversity and inclusion in the leadership levels the IT firms are driving. Its Bengaluru-based peer Wipro had appointed Laura Langton as CMO in 2019. In a conscious effort, Wipro also appointed Subha Tatvarti as chief technology officer, and Stephanie Truman as chief growth officer."

HCL Tech is likely to on-board 30,000 freshers in FY23 as the company steps up its campus hiring as the demand and supply gap widens, says VV Apparao, chief human resources officer.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, Apparao said the company had been adding 40-50 percent more freshers every year and this would take the hiring count to 30,000.

In 2020, the company hired 14,000 freshers, and it looks to on-board 20,000-22,000 freshers in 2021.

“So, we seem to be roughly adding 40-50 percent more every year and I think we should be in the ballpark of 30,000 (for FY23),” he said. The company employs about 1.76 lakh people.

This comes at the back of the company’s move to create more in-house talent. Currently in the company hiring tally, freshers account for about 35 percent and 65 percent laterals. However, as the talent becomes expensive, it wants to increase fresher hiring to 70 percent over the next couple of years.

Having a higher fresher pipeline addresses the issue of high attrition amid the hiring boom the IT industry is seeing, filling the gap in terms of skills such as cybersecurity, where there is a crunch, and also the challenge of salary inflation.

At the back of the pandemic, demand is far outstripping the supply and it is one of the key challenges the IT companies are facing currently. In its earnings call last quarter, Cognizant said that it had to let go of some projects due to talent shortage.

While Apparao said that the company did not lose projects, he pointed out that execution timelines are getting stretched due to delay in on-boarding of talents.

“There is a huge demand supply gap, (which is) 200-300 percent kind of what we used to see,” Apparao pointed out.

According to Apparao, if this demand supply gap is not fulfilled the attrition will continue to increase since there is only a finite number of experienced professionals and if they are getting more money for their skills, they are going to leave.

This was one of the reasons why hiring more freshers has become important.

“So if you have a pipeline or mechanism in which you can create, train and deploy them, which is what we are doing with all of our capability teams. Increasingly, these timelines (to train and deploy) will get shorter and shorter and shorter,” he added.

The company is also hiring more freshers from reputed institutions like the Indian Institute of Technology. The company has recruited 206 from IITs this year, which was 134 last year. From the three Indian Institute of Management schools, Indian School of Business and XLRI the company has hired 26 people, which was zero last year.

“We have significantly increased hiring from IIMs. We want to increase the profile of HCL Tech in terms of skills. Even in fresher hiring we are trying to recruit only from top 200 colleges,” Apparao said"

While the 76-year-old Nadar, who will continue as the strategic adviser to the board, has been named the Chairman Emeritus, it will be Vijayakumar, 53, who will be in the hot seat.

In an interview to Moneycontrol, Vijayakumar talks about his new role, the demand environment, the hiring boom and investments. Edited excerpts:

With founder Shiv Nadar stepping down as the Managing Director and your elevation to the position, what changes for you in terms of role and responsibilities apart from the designation?

I think the day-to-day business operations, I was already fully learning it. But definitely certain very long-term strategic initiatives he was very focused on, ideally looking at what would the next 10 years or 15 years look like, and what kind of initiatives that we lay the foundation on.

I think when he spent 50 years, he's a legend in the industry and he could really see what lies 10 or 15 years ahead. He will continue to be available as a strategic adviser. We will have the benefit of getting his steer on some of these topics. But executing some of those long-term strategies is a responsibility that I, and the rest of the leadership team, sort of carrying forward.

If we look at the June quarter, HCL Tech registered a weak quarter compared to its peers, though it was in line with your guidance. Do you see a turnaround in the next quarter and what are the key challenges?

So I expect Q2 to be a strong quarter. In the case of Q1, we planned it to be a little less due to various dynamics in the business, whether it is transitions, or projects getting completed. All of that was factored in when we gave the guidance but we came a little below our own expectations because there was some unanticipated impact due to the second wave, where we had allowed pandemic leaves for our employees. This was an additional leave on top of the kitty of leaves everybody had. So this means that it is going to result in a direct billing loss. But we are very confident to make up and deliver on the overall double-digit growth.

During the earnings call, you said that you expect to grow in the low double digits, at around 10 percent. This is in contrast to some of your peers who have guided for mid to high teens. Are there any reasons that are stopping you from giving more generous guidance?

We consciously don't want to give very specific guidance because that, I believe, focuses the team on a very short-term objective. I want them to focus on mid to long-term objectives. So the right metric to keep tracking would be booking because it eventually converts to revenue.

If you look at the headcount that also eventually translates to revenue. So that way we want to focus the teams more towards booking, and revenue will follow. It is just a matter of time. So that's the approach we are taking. We think that this is a better long-term approach and a better use of management time than just chasing the quarterly.

Do you also see margins coming under pressure—rising employee costs due to wages and travel picking up?

We factored all that in our 19-21 percent margin. So, some of the wage inflation and travel costs are coming back, all of that is factored in and we are also planning to hire 22,000 fresh talent across the world. So, I think as they come into the workforce, get trained and deployed, some of the talent cost pressures may moderate a little bit. Then this quarter we had one off impact due to the pandemic and that will also moderate into the next quarter.

Your bookings have come down sequentially in this quarter to $1.67 billion. Though this is 37 percent more than the same period last year, which was amid the pandemic, would it be a fair comparison? Are there any segments/industries that are taking time to close?

Our fourth quarter was the peak and that was why we saw $3 billion booking. Also, the right way to look at bookings is on a year-on-year basis, instead of quarter-on-quarter. If you look at Q1 FY20 and Q1 FY21, you would expect an increase but it (deal wins) was more or less flat. That has been made up by 37 percent. If you take an average, it is 17-18 percent per year. Also, we believe for the full year our bookings will be better than what we had in the previous year. The pipeline is at its highest and they will convert, and our win ratios are very good.

With the conservative guidance of 10 percent, the peer you overtook in revenue terms in FY19, Wipro, is looking to close the gap. It has also announced a $1-billion investment in cloud over three years. What are your thoughts? Is this pecking order additional pressure?

I cannot really comment on others but obviously, at any point, people will reach new milestones. I don't want to compare myself with anyone. We were not working towards the pecking order in any case. We want to do our best and be the best version of ourselves.

HCL Tech has a strong focus on products and platforms. You shared Industry Software Groups and also SaaS play HCL Now, which you consider as a significant growth driver. Could you share your playbook for these?

If you look at our products and platform, it has a lot of stable products and we are modernising them and playing to build a growth trajectory on that. But we are adding some of the next-generation kind of offerings. HCL Now is the SaaS version of all the matured products that we had, like Unica marketing automation, or big fix all of that. Customers can deploy in a cloud of their choice. So we have the product in the cloud-agnostic manner.

Also, traditionally we have a very strong product engineering capability in our engineering services division, and they have built some good products in the telecom, like 5G. We have also acquired products from Cisco as well. Combining all this, we defined an Industry Software Group that will focus on three areas. One is telecom, which will focus on 5G, manufacturing where the focus is Industry 4.0 and enterprise cloud. So in these three areas, we want to build either through partnerships or our own investments to build our own products. This adds another growth engine to the overall products and platforms.

With SaaS play, which are the markets you are going after and how do you envision it?

It's more horizontal like e-commerce is an application which can be used by any industry. Similarly, marketing automation or digital experience, these are common across industries. Once we put it on cloud, then it is mostly adopted by larger enterprises. While small and medium companies are also a client base, bigger traction is in the large enterprises.

How big is this market you are looking at?

So I think it is a very big market, like telecom, industry 4.0 and enterprise cloud. But if you look at the products that we have in mind, I think that the total addressable market would be at least $10 billion.

You shared earlier that you are investing one percent of your revenues to expand to newer geographies such as Australia, Canada, the US, Japan and also South Korea, and expanding capabilities. Is this amount close to $200 million?

Our investment had multiple things. One is new geographies and also strengthening the sales teams in our products and platform business, and also building a little more digital engineering capabilities on the engineering and R&D side. So these three together were 1 percent incremental investments that we were making. So if you take it to over two years, then it is $200 million.

Your agreement with IBM when you purchased its select products for $1.8 billion ended on June 30, 2021. Could you share if IBM continues to be your customer and the financial impact on the same?

I can't talk about a particular client but I can tell you there was no financial impact and we continue to modernise the products. We have discontinued the last version of the domino platform, which we implemented on-premise. I don't want to comment on anything specific.

We are looking at double-digit growth again and people are hiring in large numbers just when we thought the industry was maturing. Is this the return of the great Indian IT boom? Also, is it more intense than a decade ago, in terms of competition?

That's how it feels, very much like what we saw about 10 years back when there was a huge uptake in a lot of these areas. The demand for talent is so high and everybody's keeping two offers, or three offers. Then they decide not to join this company at the last minute.

Yes, it is more intense. The competition from multiple angles has increased compared to what you would have seen 10 years back. But I think Indian IT continues to maintain its edge in terms of balance, quality of work, and how we handle client relationships. I think it will be stand out significantly."

HCL Technologies will hire 20,000-22,000 freshers in FY22, up 50 percent from what the company hired last fiscal. The company will also roll out salary increments effective July 1 to retain talents as attrition rises.

During the earnings call on July 19, VV Apparao, chief human resources officer, said, “Last year we on-boarded globally 14,600 freshers and this year we are targeting anywhere between 20,000 to 22,000 freshers. I will not be surprised if we even cross that number.”

Apparao added that the company was stepping up its fresher intake as it looks to increase the internal fulfillment rate, as the demand and supply gap widens. “They (freshers) don’t have anything to unlearn and it is easy to train them on new age skills. Also skilling up is possible in the talent pool. As a part of that we have on-boarded 3,444 in Q1 and Q2 we are targeting 6000,” he added.

The company added 7,500 people in the quarter. Attrition; however, increased in the quarter ending in June 2021 to 11.8 percent from 9.9 percent in the previous quarter. Apparao said the company does see salary costs of employees going up.

“We plan to give increments to employees starting July 1. Last time we had given on October 1, 2020. We are getting back to regular cycle. We see pressure in salary costs,” he added.

HCL Tech has vaccinated 70 percent of its employees so far and expect to vaccinate its entire workforce by the end of this quarter. The company has three percent of the employees coming to offices currently and this number is slowly going up. While the company is looking to get employees back to office, it did not give a timeline for the same.

Its peers TCS and Wipro said the firms are looking at bringing employees back to office starting September whereas Infosys said it may get the workforce back to office in the next 6-9 months.

Hundreds of IBM employees, including those in India, faced disruption in accessing their email over the last couple of days. This happened as the US major is migrating from its current Lotus Notes email system to a new communication environment, according to sources aware of the development.

This move comes 1.5 years after the company sold Lotus Notes, along with select other products, to HCL Tech in December 2018 in a $1.8 billion deal.

According to a statement from an IBM spokesperson, “Some IBM employees are experiencing email service delays. We are working to restore full service as quickly as possible, and we are leveraging a variety of alternative communications tools to ensure minimal disruption to our clients and to our business while we work to restore full email capabilities.”

IBM did not respond to Moneycontrol’s detailed query on what went wrong and if the disruption impacted its business.

However, sources shared insights on what happened.

What happened?

A senior IBM executive explained that the disruption happened as the company is now moving to a new communication environment from Lotus Notes, and that had been made available to 3.5 lakh employees across the world.

The migration process, the executive said, was accelerated in the last 1.5 months. This was on account of an agreement with HCL Technologies where IBM was allowed to use Lotus Notes software for a certain period after it was sold to the IT major.

“We had an agreement with HCL Tech, where for a period of time, IBM will be able to use Lotus Notes without paying license fee to HCL tech. That was till June 30, 2021. If we don’t move from today onwards we will have to pay for licenses to HCL Tech for using the Lotus Notes software,” the executive explained.

While the company moved the critical applications that were running on Lotus Notes on priority, this was not the case with other applications such as email services.

The executive explained that the company has been developing internal email communication tool Domino, which requires more testing and so people were being moved only in a phased manner since server and other system configurations need to be changed.

However, as the deadline approached, hundreds of people started accessing the system at the same time causing outages and delay in email communication, the executive said.

While most employees were unable to access their work emails for a day or two, post which it was restored, many continue to face delay in receiving emails.

Even as IBM is now working fast to restore the email communication and establish alternative tools for communication, it is not clear if the company will license Lotus Notes from HCL Tech till it solves email migration issues to the new environment.

Both IBM and HCL Tech did not respond to Moneycontrol’s query on this. It is also not clear if HCL Tech was involved in the migration process. A query sent on the same did not elicit any response.

Criticism

The issue with migration has not gone down well with industry experts.

“It has been more than 48 hours and it is a major disaster. It is not just a small percentage of the company, but the entire workforce was affected,” said one of the industry sources, who tracks the company and did not want to be quoted.

This especially comes in the last day of the quarter, and half a year ending, a critical time period, for enterprises. “It has really messed up planning. In hindsight somebody should have seen this coming,” said the source."

It is not just the public at large, which is struggling against the pandemic. Some of India’s top companies are feeling the heat because of the utter shortage of vaccines.

Take HCL Tech, which started the vaccination drive for its employees in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) on May 12 and plans to extend it to other cities like Chennai soon.

For the programme to be successful, more clarity is needed from the government on the availability of vaccines, says VV Apparao, Chief Human Resources Officer, HCL Tech.

In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Apparao said, “We have started vaccination for our people from May 12. But these are not very large quantities because private hospitals have to get this commitment from the manufacturers.""

The company will administer vaccines at two of its campuses in the National Capital Region and one in New Delhi.

HCL Tech has tie-ups with hospitals in Chennai. “We are yet to finalise the date, but that will be sometime during this week,” said Apparao.

The company would need at least 6 lakh doses, both for the employees and the vendors it is looking to vaccinate in the country. “So far, we have got commitment for a few thousand doses in NCR and Chennai and are hoping for the volumes to increase,” he pointed out.

While the company wants to vaccinate the employees and their families in a three-month period, lack of clarity and transparency on production volumes and when it would be made available to them, is posing to be a challenge.

This comes even as the second wave is ravaging the country. India reported 3.29 lakh new cases and 3,876 deaths on May 10.

The healthcare system is crumbling with a huge shortage for oxygen cylinders and beds in states like Karnataka, New Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh.

This is impacting the tech workforce as well, affecting many employees and their families. “What we are also seeing is that affected people are struggling to survive despite the best medical attention,” Apparao said.

Also, unlike the older population and those with comorbidities, who were impacted in the first wave last year, the younger population between the age group of 30 and 45 are also affected.

The company has stepped up its efforts to cater to the growing needs for intensive care unit (ICU) beds and oxygen across the cities.

But as the situation persists, it might lead to supply-side challenges, admitted Apparao.

“It (second wave) has peaked in Maharashtra and NCR. Now we are seeing cases increasing in Chennai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad. Again, to what extent will they be controlled, or will they become like NCR and Mumbai,’’ he queried, in unknown anticipation.

Vaccination is clearly the solution, as pointed out by multiple healthcare experts.

“It is no longer the 70-crore population in India, but pretty much the 130-crore population, which has to be vaccinated for normalcy to return. But whether the vaccine production will match that increase (is not clear). Also, pricing also is a bit aggressive in private hospitals,” Apparao said.

“At this point in time, we definitely want governments to help us in terms of getting clarity and make vaccines available so that industries can quickly inoculate their people and return to normalcy. Because it is the industry that contributes to the gross domestic product (GDP),” he added.

Apparao said that they ``have represented the government through various forums but we still have not heard anything clearly.”"

India’s third-largest IT services provider HCL Technologies‘ reported all-time-high net new deal wins of $3.1 billion for the quarter ended March 31, and is all set for double-digit growth in FY22 as the growth momentum continues.

The company racked up revenue of $10.2 billion in FY21, up 2.4 percent year-on-year. In an interaction with Moneycontrol, C Vijayakumar, CEO, HCL Technologies, talks about what is driving the double-digit growth, investments, and the challenges stemming from the second Covid wave ravaging India. Edited excerpts:

HCL Tech is looking at double-digit growth in FY22. However, you have refrained from giving any specific outlook. Why?

We didn’t want to be very specific on this. Double-digit is the flow we want to accomplish. We will provide more metrics around bookings in the future. We have already declared bookings in the last quarter and full-year booking on net new deals. I thought it is a little more relevant and useful for the management team to focus on bookings. Once bookings happen the revenue will go through. That is the thought process. Instead of giving very precise guidance, the focus is on bookings and execution. So, unfortunately, we cannot share any colour on the nature of double-digit growth.

While your revenue grew 3 percent sequentially in Q4 FY21, your net profit dropped 26 percent and margin declined as well. Can you share the reasons for the decline?

One element is the software product business. This (January to March) is a seasonally weak quarter, and you would have seen a decline in revenue. That directly impacts the bottom line. And then the second element was also wage hikes applicable for some of the senior employees during the quarter.

And usually, at the beginning of the year, there are certain costs that come into a P & L. So, those are the factors that reduced the operating margin. As for the net profit, there was a taxation element and the one-time bonus (to commemorate the milestone of achieving $10 billion in revenue). These are the factors that contributed to lower profits.

Considering that bonuses and covering vaccination costs of employees and their families are likely to impact margins in the next quarter, what are the margin levers you have?

Increasing a little bit of utilisation, onsite and offshore mix and a little more automation. We have a lot of managed-services work where automation plays an important role in optimising the cost and reducing the workload. These are the standard levers we’ve been applying and that continue.

The second wave of the pandemic has seen more people affected than the first wave. How do you see it impacting delivery?

It is still early days and we are taking it day by day. The only comforting factor is that we have an onshore presence as well. So, wherever we are impacted, we are shifting some additional work onshore. But it is too early to comment.

You have stated that you have an aspirational goal to have Mode 2 services (new-generation services) revenue match traditional services in the medium term. Please elaborate on this.

In our services, we are trying to increase the composition of Mode 2. We have focused Mode 2 teams in every service line, whether it is cloud or the internet of things, security, digital analytics, or application modernisation.

In three years we should see our services business somewhat equal in Mode 1 (traditional) and Mode 2. The product business is a separate area.

Does this mean that you expect the traditional IT services business to come down and expect Mode 2 to compensate for it?

That is correct. In traditional services, the focus is on how you can reduce the cost and where you can really make your operations more automated, very lean and reduce costs. So, the savings can be reinvested in a lot of new areas, which could be helping the business transform or enhance customer experience, optimise your supply chains and your inventory management. Technologies like IoT can help in streamlining a lot of asset-related industries. Those are the areas where we are seeing good traction.

You have planned investments in newer geographies and enhancing capabilities. Can you share where the investments will happen and the quantum?

We have stepped up investments (this year) and this will also generate more business. We will spend approximately about 1 percent of our revenue in all the new areas, which includes a significant increase in our sales teams and the products and platforms segment. It includes a presence in a lot of geographies (like Australia, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Japan) or an additional and enhancing presence in those geographies and (building) some specific Mode 2 capabilities. We will also invest to build entry-level hiring in different geographies or where we are increasing our entry-level hiring requirements.

Is this range of investments specific to FY22 or will it continue?

These are incremental things and it should not be happening every year. In one or two years, it should stabilise.

Consulting seems to be one of the biggest themes this year. What is HCL Tech’s thought process on this?

I think it’s very situational. In some verticals, we may invest in building consulting capabilities, and in some we may not. So, it is very specific to different industries and service lines.

I think we are already doing extremely well in the digital consulting space. But our consulting is more around operating model transformation, change management. For example, how do we convert an existing operating model to a more vertical or product aligned operating model?

So, we are very strong in that space. That is helping us in our new wins and client conversations. And that’s what is driving Mode 2 growth. So, we do not really think we will invest a lot in business consulting. That’s not our area of focus."

India’s third largest IT major HCL Tech will hire 20,000 freshers in FY22 on the back of increasing demand for digital and robust deal pipeline, said VV Apparao, Chief Human Resources Officer.

Apparao, during the earnings call on April 23, said that the company is in an aggressive hiring mode and has already made 17,000 offers. The company, he said, expects the number to ramp up to 20,000 during the year. HCL Tech on-boarded close to 15,000 freshers in FY21.

Its peer, too, have robust hiring plan in place. TCS will hire 40,000 from campuses, whereas Infosys and Wipro will hire 26,000 and more than 9,000 from campuses, respectively.

HCL Tech hired a total of 44,695 employees in FY21, a mix of freshers and laterals. Total employee count at the end of the year stood at 168,977, with net addition of 18,554 staff last fiscal.

The attrition declined to 9.9 percent, from 10.2 percent in the previous quarter, even as the war of talent continues to be the theme of the year.

While the company expects the attrition to increase in the coming quarters owing to the huge demand for tech talents, it has already put in place processes such as skill-based bonuses to reward and retain top talent.

In response about the compensation for FY22, Apparao said the company will take a call on that in this quarter given the wage hikes and bonuses were awarded over the last three to six months.

The company rolled out wage hikes for its employees, effective October 2020 and a one-time bonus to the tune of Rs 700 crore last quarter. The hikes were in the range of 7-8 percent for offshore employees and 2-3 percent for their onsite counterparts.

HCL Tech results

The company reported net profit in dollar terms at $2,696 million, up 3 percent quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) and up 6 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) for Q4 FY21. For the year ending March 31, 2021, the company reported $10.2 billion in revenues, up 2.4 percent year-on-year.

The company has signed 19 digital transformation deals in the quarter. C Vijayakumar, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), said the new total contract value of new deals are at an all-time high at $3.1 billion, up 49 percent YoY. For FY21, new deal TCV stood at $7.3 billion, which is 18 percent increase over FY20.

This momentum comes on the back of multi-year transformation cycle the IT firms is seeing.

Multi-year transformation cycle

In an interaction with Moneycontrol last quarter, Prateek Aggarwal, CFO, had said that given the size of IT landscape that most of its customers have, be it Fortune500 companies in the US, it will take years to change to digital technologies like cloud migration or to be nimbler to serve their customers better.

“I see it at least a 3-5 year kind of technology upcycle. As far as HCL is concerned we have invested quite in advance,” he added. This includes investment in its Mode 2 and Mode 3, which are digital technologies and products and platforms, over the last few years."

With the COVID-19 inoculation drive beginning across the country, HCL Tech is currently working with industry bodies to see how quickly its 1.59 lakh employees and their families can get vaccinated, said VV Apparao, Chief Human Resources Officer.

In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Apparao said: “Our intent is that we want our employees and our families to be taken care of. But we are still waiting for guidelines from the government on how this can be taken up.”

The vaccination drive began on January 16, 2021 and so far close to 16 lakh have been inoculated. Healthcare professionals will be get vaccine shots in the first phase followed by frontline workers such as armed forces and municipal workers. The third phase will include those who are 50 years or above and those with comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes.

The company is working with IT industry body NASSCOM and the Confederation of Indian Industry on getting its employees vaccinated. Apparao explained that so far there is not much clarity on how companies can vaccinate their employees. For instance, it is not clear yet if the vaccine will be made available in the retail market, or if the producers can talk to companies and provide the vaccines required.

The company is also trying through various sources such as directly contacting vaccine producers and reaching out to implementation partners, some of whom are getting themselves ready for the vaccine rollout.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

“All those things we are doing. But in the absence of any policy clarity nobody is able to commit anything,” Apparao pointed out.

What other companies are saying

Vaccination plans are in the works at other IT companies as well, and they are working with associations and government agencies for the same. This is important given that the Indian IT industry employs about 45 lakh people. The top four IT companies, TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCL Tech, employ more than 10 lakh people.

Nitin Rakesh, CEO, Mphasis, a mid-tier IT firm, said: “We are talking to various authorities and associations.”

Rakesh explained that each jurisdiction has a different policy. For instance, the US model is different from the one in India. Even within the US, each State has a different model. So, the company is working with industry bodies and government agencies for the same.

In a recent interview with Moneycontrol, V Ramakrishnan, CFO, TCS, said: “We are working on that…This is an evolving situation. Right now we don’t have a firm plan but this is something that is very important.”

Jatin Dalal, CFO, Wipro, said during an interaction on January 13 that “it is too early to call out a strategy around it. We certainly are studying this.”"

Noida-based IT major HCL Tech will hire close to 12,000 freshers for FY22 as the company is looking at a robust deal pipeline with demand recovering, said VV Apparao, Chief Human Resources Officer.

In an interaction with Moneycontrol on Wednesday, Apparao said: “We are now doing a bottom-up exercise in terms of the amount of fresher intake that we have to do (for next year). We are going through that review process. I think it would take four weeks before we can finalise that.”

“But it won’t be less than what it is this year. We will maintain the 10,000-12,000 count for next year as well,” he added. So far, the company has on-boarded 3,000 freshers, and expects another 9,000 to join in the next two quarters.

Its peers TCS and Infosys hired 40,000 and 16,500 freshers, respectively, for FY21.

COVID-19 concerns and bounce-back

HCL Tech's hiring cycle is from January to May. The company could not finish student hiring before May as the pandemic hit and universities closed.

Some IT companies had suspended lateral hiring and deferred fresher on-boarding in Q1 FY21 due to the uncertainty over the pandemic. This resulted in a net decline in headcount of IT firms to 9,000 in Q1.

However, starting Q2 FY21, companies have witnessed demand returning to pre-COVID-19 levels, with deal pipelines reflecting the same. TCS signed deals worth $8.6 billion in Q2 and Infosys worth $3.15 billion, its highest deals in a quarter.

HCL Tech , too, reported the highest-ever deal pipeline for the quarter ending September 2020, with a 20 percent increase compared to the previous quarter. The company will continue to chase more projects in the coming quarters as well, Apparao said.

This translates to a need for more talent for these projects, especially, digital. So there is a need more lateral hiring as well, he said.

Lateral hiring plans

Lateral hiring will be a mix of niche skills in new-age technologies and generic skills. Generic skills include basic knowledge of software development like coding and testing, without any specialisation that some roles require.

HCL Tech did not disclose the number of lateral hiring intake planned as it changes, depending on the deal pipeline to be executed.

Explaining about the lateral talent landscape, Apparao said: “Generic skills are available in the market and you don’t have to train them. It could be entry level, mid-level and slightly above junior level at competitive price points.”

“What is not available in the market is the Mode 2 (new generation services) kind of skills in the areas of digital, analytics, cloud, cybersecurity, IoT (Internet of Things),” he pointed out.

According to him, these skills, even when available, come at a very high price and take more lead time to join the firm, costing them project opportunities.

This is a challenge when companies are looking to win projects and need to show clients that they have the talent pool to handle them.

So the company has accelerated its reskilling programme since the pandemic to address this issue and that helped improve the internal fulfillment rate. “Our internal fulfillment rates in FY21 (new skills area) compared to FY20, if I see, has almost doubled,” he added.

Reducing the dependency has given the company more control and tap into the new-age opportunities that will otherwise be lost to them, he added."

The company is also looking to expand its presence in Europe and Asia Pacific and product and platform offerings and is more open to acquisitions.

In a conversation with Moneycontrol, C Vijayakumar - the president and chief executive officer of HCL Technologies - shares more about what drives the company’s confidence in this space. Though there are no plans to run products and platforms as separate businesses, Vijayakumar does not completely rule out the option as well.

Q: HCL Tech saw a 20 percent quarter-on-quarter increase in deal wins in Q2, a record high you had pointed out during the earnings call. Could you give us the nature of these deals and what was a key driver?

A: The contribution to the pipeline is quite broad-based. Many of them are modernizing the legacy landscape, that’s one big theme. The second theme is cost reduction and making the cost structure more variable, especially in some of the sectors that are under stress.

One of the key differentiators (for our wins) was our very strong play in digital foundation, which is our erstwhile infrastructure business. Now, a lot of clients are looking at making their infrastructure more resilient in the wake of the pandemic. At the same time they are looking to reduce the cost of the infrastructure. So they are looking at providers that can bring in automation and right shoring capabilities for infrastructure services.

So, that is a direct correlation to the increasing pipeline at the end of this quarter.

Q: You expect your new generation services and products to earn 50 percent of the revenue in the next three years. Where does the confidence come from?

A: Right now Mode 2 (next gen services) and Mode 3 (products and platforms) contribute to about 37 percent of revenue. Mode 2 has grown 25 percent year-on-year driven by application modernization, cloud migration, cybersecurity and Internet of things. Because we classify these four areas as Mode 2.

There are some new services in Mode 1 (core services) around digital workplace and software defined networks. So, it will together account for about 40-42 percent. We expect this to keep increasing for the next few years to be 50 percent.

Q: Analysts and market watchers do not share your confidence when it comes to products and platforms. What are your thoughts about this?

A: It is a new and differentiated strategy. So over the last 4 quarters, we have seen good performance in products and platform (P&P) space. This should give confidence about underlying stability in the business. We invest close to $250 million a year in R&D, mostly in P&P that is helping us launch new products and new innovation, solutions for the new world.

These are the right things which we have done. We have seen good traction and our pipeline is good. I don’t want to give an outlook. But we feel very good about this business at this point.

Q: Recently the tech major IBM hived off its infrastructure business to focus on cloud. Given you focus on products and platforms strategy, do you see similar spin off in HCL tech?

A: We have not really thought of it at this point. At this point we are comfortable having products and platforms operate as a separate division within HCL Tech. Beyond that there are always things we can think of. But there is nothing as of now.

Q: Would you continue your acquisition strategy?

A: We have done only two small acquisitions in the last 6-9 months. We will continue to look for acquisitions in three areas. One, is to enhance and broad-base our digital capabilities, SaaS and some of the new technologies.

Second one will be innovative IP that will help us to drive for more growth for our products and platform segment.

Third would be expand and bring market presence in newer geographies.

Q: Could you give us more colour on newer geographies you are looking to expand?

A: Looking to expand in newer areas like France, Germany and Japan. These are all larger markets be it Germany, France, Australia, Japan and Canada. We have a good presence in these geographies. But we intend to expand our presence. The IT spend in these geographies contribute to a significant portion of the global IT spend.

By strengthening our presence in these geographies, we will benefit.

Q: How has conversations with clients changed during the pandemic?

A: I think the lot of leaders are happy that they are able to continue to have good meetings through teleconferencing and video conferencing solutions. It has not come into the way of strategy or initiative in moving forward. It could have paused for a couple of weeks or a month. But almost everything got reinitiated. In fact I meet a lot more customers these days than what I used to meet pre-pandemic.

Because pre-pandemic meeting clients needed a lot of planning and logistics since customers are located all over the world. So I used to travel 150 days in a year. Now the last 150 days I have not travelled at all. So to that extent things have changed quite a bit.

Q: Is that impacting deal closures?

A: See, obviously meeting in person provides a lot more comfort and confidence, especially new clients whom we are trying to acquire. So, for new clients it is going to take longer than the usual cycle. But for existing clients I don’t think that is an issue. They already know us and have comfort with us. Whether we are doing it remotely or on premise, it is not making so much of a difference.

But, for new clients, this is important. What helps us is we have strong client references, we have highest client satisfaction. That gives confidence to clients.

Q: Are there any changes in strategy or governance with new chairperson Roshni Nadar-Malhotra in place?

A: In a lot of these things, Roshni has been involved for the past several years. She was very much the part of strategy and governance. So I see a lot of continuity of ideas and strategy because of that.

Q: What are your thoughts on remote working? Some of your peers have spoken about the need for coming back to office to nurture culture and innovation.

A: We will adopt a hybrid working model in the office and at home. It is broadly 50-50.

But, we do want people to come back to office as the environment improves. And we think it is important. We don’t expect it to be a fully virtual operating model. I don’t think that will be viable."

Noida-based IT services firm HCL Tech will hire 12,000 freshers for FY21 from campuses. The company has already hired close to 3,000, and the rest would be on-boarded in the next two quarters, said VV Apparao, Chief Human Resources Officer, HCL Tech.

The company is also hiking salaries in two instalments, effective October and January 2021. Its peers TCS Infosys and Wipro , too, have announced the salary increment cycle for Q2.

All the top IT companies, including HCL Tech, had suspended hikes following COVID-19.

Hiring

Apparao, in an earnings call on October 16, after the announcement of the Q2 results, said that the company hired 1,500 freshers in Q2 and 1,200 in Q1 from campuses, and are significantly enhancing this in the next two quarters.

“We were unable to recruit in many universities and colleges because they (students) had not finished their final exams. So, they are not yet qualified to join us though we have given them offers,” he explained.

“The reason for confidence for the next two quarters is that we have already made offers to a lot of students. It is a question of them finishing their final year and joining us,” he added.

There is a robust hiring plan in place for lateral hiring, too. On this front, Apparao said that the company will be hiring significantly and expects recruitment to take place before December. “It is much more than the initial two quarters. That is reflective of the pipeline what C Vijayakumar (CEO) is mentioning,” he said.

The company reported revenues of $2.5 billion for the quarter-ended September 2020, up 4.5 percent quarter-on-quarter on constant currency, in line with its mid-quarter guidance. This was on account of better deal momentum and growth across verticals and service lines.

The company had made many revisions to its Q2 guidance. After the mid-quarter guidance, it revised its Q2 guidance to 3.5 percent last month. Earlier, it had projected 1.5-2.5 percent.

For Q2, C Vijayakumar, CEO, HCL Tech, said the company closed 15 transformational deals and new order bookings increased 35 percent compared to the last quarter.

Salary hikes

According to Vijayakumar, this has led the company to resume its salary hikes this year. HCL Tech follows the July cycle for salary hikes.

The company had, in July, suspended salary hikes for FY21, owing to COVID-19. With demand recovering, the salary hikes will resume.

For those till the E3 band (Junior Associates to Project Managers), the salary hike would start from October 1, 2020. For others, it would take effect from January 2021. Average salary hikes stand at 6 percent for offshore employees and 2.5 percent for onsite employees."

India’s third-largest IT services firm, HCL Tech, shared a mid-quarter update last week that sent its shares surging over 7 percent.

In the update, the company increased its revenue guidance for the second quarter (July-September 2020) to 3.5 percent from the 1.5-2.5 percent it had forecast during Q1, as it saw growth momentum across verticals and service lines.

It was the first of the top Indian IT firms to give such an update.

HCL Tech did not attribute the change in guidance to any particular deal. It said good booking momentum continued this quarter, led by life sciences and healthcare, telecom and media and financial services verticals.

The pipeline continues to look healthy across service lines, verticals and geographies, it said.

What gives HCL Tech the confidence?

Kalyan Kumar B, Chief Technology Officer, IT Services, HCL Tech, said the answer lies in the company’s diverse business portfolio that focuses on IT services, engineering and products and platforms.

“What is unique is we don’t have a single product or a single service line. We have more diversity and the ability to address a larger addressable market. That is what makes us more confident,” he explained.

HCL Tech is not the only company with a diverse portfolio. Most of the top IT firms, including TCS, Infosys and Wipro, have their own engineering and products and platform play.

For instance, Infosys has Finacle and TCS has Ignio and TCS BaNCS. Wipro has HOLMES. All these firms have engineering as a portfolio as well.

However, Pareekh Jain, founder, Pareekh Consulting, explained that unlike other IT firms, HCL Tech had a strategic focus on pure play engineering and products and platforms and was aggressive in growing in these areas.

Services mix, multiple long-term contracts

HCL Tech was one of the first top Indian IT firm to cross the $1-billion revenue mark in both engineering and products space, he said. The focus has also helped the IT firm scale up there and win larger deals, he added.

Axis Securities, in a note, said that HCL Tech has a better services mix and multiple long-term contracts across verticals that would aid in better growth in the near term.

This spread is what helped the company gain at the back of COVID-19. For, even as client’s discretionary spend came down in certain areas, it has increased in others.

Close to 70 percent of the company’s revenue came from traditional IT services, followed by engineering and R&D services at 16 percent, and products and platforms at 13.8 percent.

During the quarter, while revenues from IT services and engineering came down due to COVID-19, products and platforms grew 77 percent for the June quarter.

For the quarter ending June 2020, HCL Tech reported revenue of $2.3 billion, down 0.3 percent year-on-year (yoy). TCS’ revenue declined 7.8 percent to $5,059 million $5.05 billion. Infosys' revenue stood at $3,121 million, down 0.3 percent y-o-y whereas Wipro's declined 5.7 percent to $1921 million $1.9 billion.

“So, if you look at it from an overall perspective, COVID-19 has short- term impacts, but I think it is all about how companies respond and realign themselves to find the right opportunity in the mid-term,” he pointed. According to him, HCL Tech is well-positioned to tap into this opportunity.

“We have seen a pretty strong adoption on cloud and digital workplace. Customers are looking at e-commerce and re-architecting some of the core supply chain. From our perspective, we seem to be pretty good,” Kumar said.

Betting on products and platform play

This confidence also comes from the company’s bet on its products and platform play. C Vijayakumar, CEO, HCL Tech, in a recent interview to ET, said that the company expects new generation services and products to account for half of HCL Tech’s revenue in three years.

Pointing out to this, Kumar said: “He (Vijayakumar) has publicly made a statement that future revenue growth will come from products and platform. It is an open book from our perspective.”

This confidence comes from the investments and the work the company has done over the last few years. The company bought IBM’s eight products for $1.8 billion. HCL Software, which refers to the company’s nextgen services portfolio include IBM products and its own products in the area of automation, business data analytics, and security platforms.

The company has also expanded its partnerships with tech players such as Google Cloud to cater to the changing technological needs. HCL Tech and banking software company Temenos signed an exclusive agreement for non-financial services segment for seven years.

The company is also expanding its presence in the telecommunications space, where it sees significant growth opportunity that will boost the company’s product and platform strategy.

In May, the company announced its intent to acquire Cisco’s SON Technology, including products and services, to cater to changing needs in the telecommunications industry as they embrace cloud and transition to 5G.

“The whole telecom market is going through a fundamental shift. They are modernising themselves through virtualisation. So the skill you need are 5G, which is the new skill. That is the big look-forward aspect,” he said."

HCL Tech expects its revenue to grow over 3.5 percent on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis in constant currency as it sees momentum across all verticals. The company also expects its operating margin to increase and to be between 20.5-21 percent.

This is higher than the 1.5-2.5 percent band the company had given for the quarter ending in June. Operating margin guidance was expected to be between 19.5-20.5 percent for FY21.

In a statement, the company said that this growth has come at the back of good deal bookings led by life sciences and healthcare, telecom and media and financial services verticals. The company said that it has also seen strong execution so far and expect it to continue for the rest of the quarter.

For the quarter ending June, the company registered $2356 million in revenues, down 7.4 percent QoQ. Its products and platforms grew 77 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis.

In an interaction with Moneycontrol, C Vijayakumar said that the company expects recovery from fourth quarter or beginning of Q1 FY22 primarily driven by digital.

“Anyone recognizes that technology is the core to reinvent the business. But I think this pandemic has brought so much attention to tech just to enable the survival of the business. Even for the basic, technology has become such a fundamental component. So the interest to know and understand the technology infrastructure at the executive level has gone up,” he said during the interview.

“This obviously means that the propensity to spend, improve, enhance and create resilient technology infrastructure has gone up significantly,” he added.

For the quarter ending in June, the company registered 11 new transformational deals. Vijayakumar pointed out that new bookings were higher compared to the same quarter in FY20."
"August 09, 2020 02:13 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/us-tech-firms-may-need-hr-revamp-to-address-discrimination-based-on-caste-5667701.html,"Caste discrimination, it would seem, is a perennial problem Indians create and deal with no matter where they go, even in the Silicon Valley.

We are talking about this thanks to two lawsuits that was filed in the US against tech firms. One of them was against the US tech major Cisco filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing on behalf of a Dalit employee, John Doe, against two upper caste superiors Sundara Iyer and Raman Kompella.

The second one, which Moneycontrol recently reported, was against the US unit of IT firm HCL Tech by its former employee, who we will call Vikram to protect the identity.

The lawsuit alleges that Vikram, who is a Kapu Naidu was discriminated by his superior Srinivas Chakravarty, a Kamma Naidu, and harboured animosity against Vikram due to caste rivalry.

The two groups have a history of rivalry that could date back to the riots in 1980s in the Vijayawada region of Andhra Pradesh, the lawsuit said.

Fight between the two castes, Kamma and Kapu, resulted the in death of over 40 people and Rs 100 crore in damages, reports had then pointed out. Chakravarty is from Vijayawada, and his caste sentiments are deep-rooted, alleged Vikram. According to the lawsuit, Chakravarty was in Vijayawada during the time of riots.

What these two issues kick-started is the conversation about caste and lack of remedies within the organisation for discrimination. For, in both the cases complaining to the human resources or senior management did not help. Rather it made it worse.

The Cisco lawsuit pointed out that after Doe complained to HR, the superiors retaliated. The lawsuit said, Doe was denied raises and promotions and was made to endure a hostile work environment.

Complaints to senior managers bore no fruit, says Vikram. He complained to Vikas Soni, then Worldwide Director for Technical Teams and Prasanna Subramanian, the Program Manager and Chakravarty’s boss, about the unfair treatment, both orally and in writing.

Eventually, Vikram was put in “performance improvement plan”, designed for poor performers to assess if they can be deployed in projects and was later terminated, the lawsuit alleged. Vikram said before Chakravarty became his superior, he was appreciated by clients for his work.

The lawsuits, however, seem to given them confidence with many people willing to accept the existence of caste discrimination and be vocal about it.

More than half a dozen people said they were aware of discrimination in the workplace on grounds of caste. “I witnessed such incidents 'live' and some included 'caste', 'region' and even 'looks'...yes they were all in the so called MNCs,” said a tweet.

“This is dangerously spreading than COVID-19. I experienced this too in some interviews,” said another Twitterati in the platform.

It is not clear how much would have gone to the HR department, but as Shanti, another affected employee pointed out, just complaining is no guarantee.

HR department is lacking

Armaan*, a senior executive in an IT outsourcing firm said, “HR is more often than the senior management's puppet. So that is why many of the incidents go unreported because they know things would get only worse for them.”

Also, the fact that these employees' visas are dependent on the employer plays a role. Most of the employees go to US either on H-1B or L-1 visa, which are employer dependent. To given the sense of this in 2019, over 1 lakh H-1B visas were issued, renewed and extended by Indians, according to US immigration agency report.

So many of them endure till they find a better job, another Indian executive from a MNC said

This is what probably explains the barrage of complaints advocacy group and tech startup Equality Labs got weeks after the Cisco lawsuit. In a data shared to VICE News, the firm said that they got complaints from 250 Dalits working in tech firms such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Netflix, on discrimination, bullying, , and even sexual harassment by colleagues who are higher-caste Indians.

According to VICE News, most of the firms ignored the requests for comments. The article further stated that Microsoft, Uber, and Netflix declined to comment on the record, whereas Dell, Cisco, and Twitter said that companies promote diversity and are dealing with complaints, the article added.

Thenmozhi Soundarajan, director of Equality Labs, told VICE News that the companies where this is happening have done little to address these issues through policies. They don’t even understand just how widespread the problem is, she said in the report.

“The HR departments in so many of these companies are just are not culturally competent enough about the issues of caste to even understand the recording of these issues,” Soundarajan said.

That is probably why the Cisco lawsuit is important. For, it is this lawsuit that has made caste a discussion in IT firms. Like the Aljaezeera article points out, it is going to be a wait and watch if the case will inspire tech firm to accept and address the caste issue in their work place."

With on-campus hiring becoming a challenge due to COVID-19, HCL Technologies is looking at more off-campus recruitment for FY21, said the company's CHRO VV Apparao.

The company is looking to recruit close to 15,000 people, including 12,000 freshers for FY21. “The 12,000 freshers will include a mix of on-campus and off-campus,” Apparao explained.

IT firms organise off-campus freshers' drive for multiple campuses, usually for tier II and tier III colleges. Since it is an open market, competition is high as students are competing with peers from multiple colleges.

Indian IT firms are one of the largest recruiters in Indian engineering colleges. However pandemic has made hiring from campuses a huge challenge.

“Hiring in campuses was part of the plan but we are not getting people in campuses today starting March,” Apparao said. The company starts campus recruitment from January through May. Due to COVID-19, hiring since March had been a challenge.

“Starting March, pretty much all the kids have gone home. Even colleges were not working. There were instances where we sent 10 people to campuses and got only five or six students,” Apparao explained.

Universities are still exploring options to see how to conduct exams for final year students and there is not much clarity on if and when colleges will open. “If this continues, we will have to get into the open market and recruit,” he added.

Apparao said, “So we have already started recruiting some fresh graduates offline because businesses cannot wait. As CVK has given guidance, we are looking at decent growth.”

HCL Tech CEO C Vijayakumar, fondly called CVK had said the company is guiding for 1.5-2.5 percent for FY21. The confidence, he said came from growing investment in technology by its clients across the verticals.

The company registered revenue of $2,356 million for the quarter ending June 2020, down 0.3 percent on a year-on-year basis. Though the hiring outlook remains strong for FY21, at 15,000 for FY21, there is not much clarity whether this would continue for the next fiscal as well.

Though there is not much clarity about on-campus recruitment for FY22 and what will happen to current third years, Apparao said, “If things don’t open up and risk levels continue the way they are today, it will become predominantly off-campus recruitment.”

IT firms begin recruiting in campuses the previous fiscal and start the onboarding from April.

The company has also stepped up reskilling efforts in the area of cloud, cybersecurity and data and digital analytics, where the demand is huge. The company had signed 11 digital transformation deals for the June quarter, some of them are large deals over $100 million.

In terms of work from home, HCL Tech has taken a stand that WFH will not be a permanent feature for the company. According to Apparao, WFH continuously is also not healthy, either physically or mentally.

“In the office, they will meet people, get some fresh air. WFH continuously, we believe that it is not healthier in the longer run. So we are not mandating anywhere,” he added.

In addition, Apparao explained that while the industry has permissions from the government and clients for the pandemic, they are temporary in nature.

“So now if you want to make it a permanent way of working then all the policy framework, guidelines for STPI, all need permanent changes including the security aspect,” he added."

HCL Technologies is suspending wage hikes for FY21 on the back of novel coronavirus, or COVID-19.

Speaking to Moneycontrol after the Q1 result announcement, Agarwal said the company has decided to suspend wage hikes for the year due to the pandemic. “We hired 2,000 laterals and on-boarded 1,000 freshers in Q1. We will continue to hire in coming quarters based on need and also attrition,” he added.

HCL Tech joins its peers Infosys and Wipro in suspending wage hikes for FY21 due to the pandemic. Like its peers, it has continued to hire laterals and started on-boarding freshers for FY21.

Infosys hired close to 5,000 laterals for Q1 and will on-board 20,000 freshers in F21. Wipro hired 7,000 laterals and will on-board freshers from Q2.

VV Apparao, Chief Human Resources Officer, said the company typically hires 3,500-4,000 laterals per quarter. “This number depends on growth and attrition since lateral hires replace those who leave,” he explained.

With attrition falling, the number of those hired are likely to reduce as well, he added.

For the quarter-ending June, attrition stood at 14.6 percent compared to 16.3 percent in the preceding quarter. Total employee count stood at 150,287, down by close to 200 compared to the March quarter.

In terms of fresher hiring, the company had handed out 15,000 offers for freshers. Close to 1,000 were on-boarded in Q1 and the rest will be on-boarded through the year.

With regards to the H-1B issue, Agarwal said the company does not see the US H-1B ban impacting them in short-term. “I don’t think there will be a long term impact as a lot of it is coming from elections in November. These are knee-jerk reactions,” he added.

The company currently has close to 68 percent locals in the US. The company had reduced its H-1B dependency to 2,781 in FY19 from 5000 visa in FY17 by stepping up localisation.

The IT services company reported a 7.3 percent quarter-on-quarter fall in its June quarter net profit at Rs 2,925 crore."

HCL Technologies’ recruitment process will be virtual this year in the wake of COVID-19 and this is likely to stay, said VV Apparao, Chief Human Resources Officer of the company.

In a recent interaction with Moneycontrol, Apparao said, “We will remain 100 percent virtual in on-boarding and recruitment,” and added that it gives the company a lot of flexibility.

“Today, we don’t have to meet any candidate and our on-boarding is online too. As we speak, we are trying to recruit 4,000-odd people and we are not calling anyone to office. Interview panels are virtual, candidates come online, offers go online and they are on-boarded online,” he added.

Earlier, candidates and panelists will find time to meet, at times travelling long distances. Then panelists have to sit together and collate the information and take a decision. “The whole process takes a long time and requires a huge amount of coordination. Now our process is completely digital,” Apparao noted.

The platform, however, is hardly new as the company has been investing in it for the last two years. “We have been preparing for this day, COVID-19 might have accelerated this a bit,” he pointed out.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

In the last one and a half years, the on-boarding process in other geographies such as the US had been made virtual. However, implementing it in India had challenges.

Apparao explained that the company could not make the on-boarding process virtual in India because employees have to physically sign certain documents for compliances.

The company will recruit 15,000 freshers and honour all the offers made so far. It is yet to take a call on wage hikes and promotions. HCL Tech follows the July cycle for its promotions and wage hikes. However, it will go slow on lateral hiring as the business has taken a hit, HCL Tech executives added.

Talking about working from home (WFH), Apparao said that more than 95 percent of its employees are WFH and so far there has not been a financial impact in terms of billing or deliverable impact due to COVID-19.

The company, which employs more than 1.5 lakh people, had asked its employees to work from home in India starting March 4. “By the time lockdown happened, we were already 95 percent working from home. So we had no issues in terms of deliverables,” Apparao added.

The company is not in a hurry to bring people back. “It is not enough that companies are taking care of everything. Employees should feel that they are adequately protected. It is not just the employee alone, the family should feel it too. So that is one reason why we are not pushing,” Apparao explained.

Apparao agrees that working from home is not an easy task. “We don’t know its long term effects. We also think some people might face psychological issues,” admitted Apparao.

The company has life coaches and doctors who are advising employees. It is also conducting employee relationship programmes such as having a Zumba dance programme every day involving not just employees, but their families too.

“We are trying to help them. All depends on how the lockdown pans out,” he added."

HCL Technologies will go slow on lateral hires due to drop in demand on the back of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic. However the company will go ahead with the hiring of 15,000 freshers as planned for FY21.

This is in line with the industry trend, where most IT majors have honoured the offers made, but froze hiring, primarily lateral hires, for FY21 due to uncertainty around the pandemic.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, Prateek Aggarwal, its CFO, said, “Hiring itself will be slow for multiple reasons. For one, iteration (demand cycle) itself has come down. Volumes are going to be lower as well. So, hiring will also reduce.”

In addition, there is increased focus on improving utilisation of existing employees and reduction in employee attrition. The company’s attrition has fallen to 16.3 percent in FY20 from 17.7 percent on a year-on-year basis. Lower attrition means that the need to fill replacement roles is reduced.

Apparao VV, CHRO, HCL Tech, pointed out that slowdown in the hiring process was also on these accounts. The company employed about 150,423 people at the end of March 31.

“At the same time, we want to honour the offers that we have already made to people,” Aggarwal said. There is no delay in on-boarding of freshers. But the focus is on those who are coming in with their own laptops and devices so that they can start work right away.

However, the company is yet to take a call on wage cuts and promotions. “Calls on wage hikes and promotions will be taken in the coming quarter. We have a July cycle and hence we are not taking any call on that right now,” he added.

HCL Tech registered revenue of $9.936 million, up 16.7 percent year-on-year in constant currency for the year ended March 31. This is well within the 16.5-17 percent guidance band that the management had announced. However, it did not issue any revenue guidance for FY21 given the outbreak of novel coronavirus and uncertainty around a demand recovery.

Close to 96 percent of HCL Tech’s work force is working from home (WFH) and the management expects less than 10 percent to resume office by the end of this quarter. The company will re-evaluate the WFH scenario once the lockdown is lifted but expects the 50-50 model to continue.

This is also in line with the Ministry of Home Affairs' (MHA) guidelines that mandates that IT/ITeS firms can work at 50 percent capacity. In the 50-50 model, 50 percent of employees will WFH and the rest in office to maintain social distancing norms and also to ensure safety of its employees.

In terms of business outlook, the company expects Q1 to be impacted due to COVID-19 and also expects pricing pressure, discounts and payment extension requests. Aggarwal explained that some of its customers are impacted by COVID-19 and expects cut in spends and a pullback in some projects.

Tamil Nadu government has partnered with HCL to set up Disaster Management Data Analytics Centre to strengthen its response to the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic.

The analytics centre will be housed in Tamil Nadu’s Disaster Management Centre in Ezhilagam Building, Chepauk, Chennai. The analytics centre will capture data trends in real time from across all districts of Tamil Nadu, the company said in a statement.

The data will then be used to make decisions on type of response needed for each district and also for graded relaxation on the current lockdown to resume economic activity, the statement added.

The company will also help improve and expand the state’s disaster management helpline (1070) through technological upgradation, manpower assistance and effective reporting mechanisms, the statement added.

HCL will upgrade an existing call centre and implement an Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) system to route calls between different government departments and also put in place an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system to help direct the queries to the appropriate state helplines.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

It will also institute proper reporting mechanism to capture data trends from citizens’ queries and reports provided by the government. This data is fed that into the Emergency Operations Centre to guide future course of action, the statement added.

J Radhakrishnan, Principal Secretary/Commissioner of Revenue Administration and State Relief Commissioner said, “Our improved disaster management helpline will enable us to respond to citizens’ queries in a timely and effective manner and also capture insights from the same to define future course of action.”"

In a first such instance, close to 80 techies from HCL Tech America earlier this week joined a United Steelworkers union (USW) in the US.

Many factors, including increasing localisation by Indian IT firms to counter the visa issues in the US and the resulting talent crunch, are leading to unionisation, said experts.

What happened?

So far, white collar workers from tech had stayed away from labour unions. But that changed on September 25, when 80 Pittsburgh contract employees from HCL America voted to unionise with USW despite the efforts from the company to stop them.

These HCL employees were deployed at Google's office.

The unionisation was in a bid to demand better remuneration, work benefits and also job security from HCL. Since they were contract employees they were not privy to any of these benefits that permanent employees can avail of.

Some reports claimed that these contract workers, who are college degree holders, earn only $40,000 per year without benefits such as sick leave and also the healthcare benefits as opposed to the permanent employee. A NASSCOM-IHS Markit report reveals that average IT salary in the US is $95,000, whereas Indian companies pay 2 percent higher.

Why the unionisation?

Unlike Silicon Valley, where the talents are expensive, areas such as Pittsburg have lower salaries.

Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder, Teamlease Services, a staffing firm, said that generally contract workers are paid higher than permanent employees given that they are not eligible for any benefits. However as demand for American locals increase, IT firms are moving to areas where talents are cheaper.

In an earlier conversation with Moneycontrol, Arvind Thakur, co-founder, NIIT, said that NIIT Tech is setting up centres in low-cost locations, where talents are available at much lower rate. These low-cost locations are tier 2 and tier 3 cities in the US such Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. NIIT Tech has set up its centre in Boise, Idaho.

This is exactly where disparity comes in and maybe to some extent justified.

""Most of the work done for Google by contractors in Pittsburgh and other tier 2-3 cities is typically non-core in nature. The pay and perks disparity between Google employees and contractors in such scenarios will be very high, given the difference in job roles,"" said Vimal Menon, Director, Zinnov, a business consulting firm

In addition, areas such as Pittsburgh are typically industry bastions where unions are common unlike the Silicon Valley, where tech jobs are predominant and remained largely non-unionised until now, Menon added.

""As companies search for more affordable talent and move into tier 2 and tier 3 cities like Pittsburgh, which have been traditional manufacturing bastions, unionisation efforts are bound to happen,"" Menon added.

This move could likely affect the sentiment of contract workers in other areas as well and that would be significant given the dependence on contract workers in the recent times.

Chirajeet Sengupta, Partner, Everest Group, pointed out that demand for contract workers have been on the rise to bridge the gap in skilled workers availability in areas such AI and ML, in addition to visa regulations. Infosys during their June quarter results accepted that continued dependence on contract workers have put their margins under pressure.

Many of these contract employees across the US are American citizens not bound by any restrictions and want their voice heard. Though they are paid more, these workers have more bargaining power in the recent times.

This creates a possibility of others following the trend despite the better pay, another expert added."

People are being laid off and factories are being shut down as demand for products and services reduce across sectors such as automobiles and FMCG. But not the IT sector.

In fact, IT is one of the few sectors that is bucking the trend even as uncertainty looms when it comes to client spending globally. The experience of having weathered multiple slowdowns in its journey and strong financials will keep the sector afloat, say experts.

In a recent interaction with Moneycontrol, Kris Gopalakrishnan, co-founder, Infosys, said, “IT sector is an exception and doing extremely well.”

The statement is not without any basis. Case in point are the robust deal bookings the IT majors witnessed.

Robust pipeline

In March 2019, HCL Tech renewed its deal with Xerox for $1.3 billion for a seven year period. It also bagged 12 large deals for the quarter that ended on June 2019. HCL Tech had given revenue guidance of 14-16 percent in constant currency terms.

TCS’ reported $5.7 billion deal win in the first quarter of FY20 compared to $4.9 billion in FY19 for the same period. The company is confident of achieving its margin guidance of 26-28 percent.

Infosys reported its biggest deal wins of $2.7 billion for Q1 and even raised its revenue guidance to 8.5-10 percent, up from 7.5-9.5 percent it gave in Q4 FY19 in the light of strong deal momentum.

In addition, the second quarter saw large scale deal wins for IT majors. For instance, Wipro won $300 million digital transformation deal from ICICI bank. TCS and General Motors had also inked a deal to work on future mobility. According to reports, the deal is worth $600 million.

The IT majors during their first quarter results announcement said that they are confident of meeting their guidance despite uncertainties.

Looming uncertainties

Globally there are uncertainties with regards to client spending, especially in the banking and financial verticals, one of the biggest verticals for major IT firms. However it is neither new nor big enough for the IT majors to worry about.

The sector has seen multiple slowdowns since the 1990s and in the first decade of the century and it was able to weather them well with the right leaderships decisions.

Also, the Indian IT firms are highly profitable. Most of them have zero debt and lot of cash on their balance sheet.

In addition, the digital transformation of IT firms is also a driving factor that will keep them insulated from slowdown pangs.

Nitin Rakesh, CEO, Mphasis, an IT service firm, pointed out that despite the slowdown or because of the slowdown, firms are more than willing to invest in IT to improve efficiency and cut down costs.

“Because that’s (technology adoption) an irreversible phenomenon. If anything they (clients) will say, let's squeeze my core business because I don’t want to spend any money there. So that gives me an opportunity to accelerate my digital spend,” he added.

Also in terms of domestic market, the slowdown is unlikely to impact the IT sector since business from Indian market is not very significant. For most IT services firms in India, revenue from India operations account for about less than 10 percent of the overall revenue.

“So I’m very optimistic about the IT industry, which is still a growing industry according to NASSCOM data,” Gopalakrishnan added.

Employment generation

The growth of IT is critical as it is the second largest employment generator in India. According to a recent employment report by CARE ratings, the sector will employ close to 12.30 lakh people in 2019, up 8 percent from 2018. This number in only next to the banking sector that employs 12.60 lakh people.

This reflected in the hiring growth in the major IT firms as well. FY19 saw positive sentiment return as IT majors went on a hiring spree after a lull in the last couple of years.

TCS saw the highest ever recruitment in the last five years for its first quarter ended June 2019. It gave offer letter to close to 30,000 freshers in the first quarter.

Some challenges

However there is word of caution. As positive the IT firms are, the major challenge is employee skilling, said Supaul Chanda, Business Head, Teamlease Digital, an IT staffing firm. Employees who are unable to upskill are being let off and those with new age skills are hard to find.

In a way what the IT sector is facing is not the recession in terms of business but of skills, he added."

Here is the list of top 10 most-attractive employer brands in India for the year 2020. (Image: PTI)

India's third and fourth largest information technology firms reported results this week, and both seem to be recovering from client-specific issues that are slowing growth.

While HCL Technologies reported second quarter results above analyst estimates, helped by growth across verticals. The Noida-based company's rupee revenue was up 7.1 percent at Rs 14,861 crore, while constant currency growth was 3 percent during the quarter.

On the other hand, Wipro’s IT services revenues rose 5 percent to Rs 14,377.3 crore, 2.8 percent after adjusting for a strong dollar.

Analysts however, are optimistic about Wipro given improvement in its operational efficiencies, and remain cautious about HCL's slowing growth momentum over the past few quarters.

""Wipro's current quarterly performance showcases how a reasonably good operational performance can be completely overshadowed by write-offs and other direct and indirect costs of refocusing the organisation to the needs of the future,"" said Sanjoy Sen, Doctoral Research Scholar, Aston Business School, UK.

Wipro has been having client issues. Two of its clients faced bankruptcy last year, and the latest quarter numbers were affected by the sale of its data centre business.

On the other hand, HCL's core growth has been a cause for worry for some time, including its infrastructure management services (IMS), which was once its fastest growing business.

""Despite citing an uptick in deal wins and demand environment, HCL Technologies' growth momentum and guidance have remained unchanged on account of some pressures, these are renewals in IMS, slower ramp-up of engagements, customer-specific issues, and restructuring in India,"" said Motilal Oswal Research Analysts Ashish Chopra and Sagar Lele.

Meanwhile, HCL said it was facing weakness in a couple of client engagements in the financial services space, which was likely to continue for the rest of the year.

Growth in the vertical was marginal at 0.1 percent in constant currency for HCL Technologies.

The banking, financial services and insurance business has been weak for tier 1 IT firms over the past year, but commentary was positive this quarter as clients begin to increase spend in digital initiatives.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported constant currency growth of 3.7 percent in BFSI segment in this quarter, while Infosys reported growth of 4.2 percent.

""This is the second consecutive quarter of weakness in the BFSI vertical and management cited that softness in two European accounts lead to this tepid performance,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher analysts Madhu Babu and Rajat Gandhi.

""Wipro also reported good growth in BFSI during the quarter. Wipro has shown strong momentum in BFSI vertical over the past six consecutive quarters which is key positive. We note that bar(r)ing HCL Tech, the other three Tier 1 IT vendors showed strong performance in BFSI vertical in second quarter of FY2019,"" the Prabhudas Lilladher analysts added.

HCL expects ""incrementally better growth in the rest of the year"", while Wipro has said the September-ended quarter was one of the highest quarter of order bookings it has ever had.

Among its peers, HCL has said it is focusing on selling products and platforms. It has made several acquisitions and partnerships to strengthen its focus in the segment that includes a long term intellectual property led deal with IBM.

These are part of its mode 3 offerings, whose revenue achieved the $1 billion annual run-rate milestone during the second quarter. The Street is however, cautious because of slowing organic business growth.

""FY19 would continue to remain a year of transition for the company... inorganic initiatives have weighed on medium term free cash flow trajectory and constraining price-to-earnings multiple expansion... potential for turnaround in organic growth from second half of FY19 and cheap valuations leads us to retain positive stance,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher analysts.

Wipro on the other hand, has had to absorb write-off costs, but most industry watchers agree that it has placed some bold bets on digital, which will likely start playing out in the next few quarters.

""(Wipro) must push ahead on its inorganic growth path by expediting pending acquisitions at the earliest opportunity. There is no doubt that Wipro has moved slower than its peers on futuristic initiatives and may have fallen a bit behind its peer group in helping its clients embrace the future technological opportunities,"" said Aston Business School's Sen."

JM Financial's research report on HCL Tech

HCL reported an in-line 2QFY19 with an internal construct that was an improvement on 1Q, though admittedly still below peers. Organic revenue growth was c.2% QoQ (JMFe); the mainstay IMS business grew 3.2% (ex-drag from the India business), and deal pipeline/wins were strong. Management expects the seasonal acceleration in 3QFY19 should help achieve the mid-point of FY19 constant currency revenue growth guidance. The EBIT margin outlook was left unchanged; HCL intends to reinvest the INR gains back in the business. Thus, changes to our FY19/FY20 EPS estimates are minor.

Outlook

We believe the stock’s inexpensive valuations – at c.12.3x FY20F EPS, HCL trades at 25%/4% discount to INFO/TECHM – and an improving outlook makes it an attractive play on a medium-term horizon. Maintain BUY with INR 1,220 PT (INR 1,190 earlier)

Moneycontrol Research Team

In our constant endeavour to enhance portfolio performance, capture valuation arbitrage opportunity and focus on high conviction ideas, we are making a few changes in our three key portfolios -- Diwali, Large cap and Mid cap while keeping our Electric Vehicle portfolio intact.

Large cap – Changing sectoral trends: Include HCL tech, ICICI Bank, and Dalmia Bharat

Source: Moneycontrol

In order to capture new sectoral flavours and insights, we are replacing Symphony and UltraTech with HCL Tech, ICICI Bank, and Dalmia Bharat.

Symphony reported a subdued set of numbers in Q1FY19 because of pricing pressure, inventory buildup across trade channels, unfavourable climatic conditions and a weak demand scenario. Such a weakness in an otherwise seasonally strong quarter is expected to have a cascading effect on the FY19 numbers as a whole.

UltraTech has delivered more than 15 percent return since inclusion in the Large Cap portfolio and the current valuations (FY19 EV/EBITDA of 18.5x) appear little stretched from a medium-term perspective.

In contrast, Dalmia Bharat is trading at a 25 percent discount to UltraTech. Dalmia Bharat, India’s fourth largest cement maker, delivered another quarter of strong double-digit volume growth for the third consecutive quarter. Stable cement prices and a richer product mix boosted revenue for the quarter gone by. Profit margin dipped marginally quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) as the company managed input price pressures with effective cost management.

Two other stocks which capture recent improving growth visibility in the IT and finance sectors are HCL Technologies and ICICI Bank.

Despite a moderate performance in the first quarter of FY19 and unchanged guidance for FY19, HCL Technologies' (HCLT) show was impressive due to the record deal wins and a positive commentary on the road ahead. While the company hasn’t yet reached the inflection point to meaningfully see the benefits of the virtuous cycle where the legacy business is more than compensated by next-generation offerings, it is directionally on the right track. We see little downside in the valuation of 12.9x FY20e (estimated) earnings. The stock, therefore, should form a part of investors’ portfolio.

ICICI bank has had a rough run in the past few years with bad loans from the corporate exposure piling up. With its 2020 vision in place, investors should expect much lower non-performing asset (NPA) formation and normalised credit cost in FY20, mid-teen loan growth and commencement of the journey to reach RoE of 15 percent. With a potential improvement in return ratios, the current valuation of its core book at 1.1 time FY20e price to book value (P/BV) is undemanding. In fact, ICICI bank is trading at a significant discount of over 30 -40 percent relative to its closest corporate lending peer, which is also facing asset quality issues and uncertainty over impending management change. While the asset quality pain might persist in the near term and FY19 may remain a year of consolidation due to higher credit costs, the risk-reward is extremely favorable. We add the stock as a long-term bet as it is attractively priced and the end to asset quality woes seems certainly near.

Midcap portfolio rejig: Replacing Sanghi with Automotive Axles

Source: Moneycontrol

Sanghi Industries, the Gujarat-based cement manufacturer had a subdued Q1FY19 due to multiple problems at the same time. The earnings visibility looks weak for the short term as raw material availability, fuel prices and other cost pressures (external factors) will continue to weigh on margins and earnings for at least 2 quarters. We, therefore, find it prudent to exclude it from the midcap portfolio for the time being and will evaluate it again after next quarterly results as we have a positive view on the cement space.

We are replacing this with Automotive Axles (AAL), which has corrected by 27 percent from its 52-week high despite a very strong set of quarterly numbers and positive outlook.

AAL manufactures drive axles, non-drive axles, front steering axles, specialty and defense axle. It also manufactures drum and disc brakes. The company caters to major original equipment manufacturers (OEM) in both domestic and export market in M&HCV, off-highway and aftermarket segments. With strong clientele in its kitty, industry tailwinds on the back of focus on infrastructure, increase in mining activity, and good monsoon coupled with reasonable valuation (16x FY20 projected earnings) earns it a place in our mid cap portfolio.

Diwali portfolio: Bringing Reliance Nippon and Dilip Buildcon in place of Tata Sponge and SpiceJet

Source: Moneycontrol

We are exiting Spicejet and Tata Sponge. While Tata Sponge continues to do well riding on the strong cycle in the steel industry lack of immediate growth calls for an exit. It is operating at over 110 percent capacity utilisation and there is no major capex in the near term.

In the case of SpiceJet, the headwinds confronting the industry makes us cautious. Passenger yields pressure on the back of fever pitch competition, a significant rise in air turbine fuel (ATF) prices and rupee depreciation are near-term challenges. While we like a couple of aviation stocks, we believe it will take some time for the industry and company to come out of these challenges.

We are adding Reliance AMC (RNAM). The company, with an 11 percent market share, strong retail brand, and well-diversified sourcing platform, will continue to be one of the key beneficiaries of the rapid growth in the mutual fund industry. Current valuation looks compelling given RNAM’s track record and financials. At the current market capitalisation of Rs 14,700 crore, RNAM is trading at 6 percent of its trailing asset under management (AUM), which is more than 50 percent discount to HDFC AMC’s current valuation. While HDFC AMC will always trade at a premium valuation, we expect valuation gap to narrow down and see more upside to RNAM’s stock price in the medium term. The financial problems of the ADAG Group—of which RNAM is part of, has hurt sentiment for the stock. But Nippon Life being an equal partner with 42.88 percent stake in the asset management firm, helps assuage the concerns.

Further, we incrementally prefer Dilip Buildcon (starting with a weightage of 2 percent), which has got good earnings visibility led by a strong order book. The stock is trading at 12 times its FY19 estimated earnings despite 30 percent return on equity, 25-28 percent earnings growth over the next two years.

The salary of the Chief Executive Officer of HCL Technologies, C Vijayakumar was Rs 33.13 crore in the financial year 2017-18, among the highest in the industry, according to the company's annual report.

His salary is not comparable to FY17 because this is his first full year as CEO.

Vijayakumar, who took over as CEO from Anant Gupta in October 2016, was paid Rs 7.06 crore in 2016-17.

This places him among the highest paid CEOs in the top four IT companies in India.

Vijayakumar, or CVK as he is popularly known, is paid through a subsidiary of HCL Technologies, the annual report said. In contrast, India's largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services' CEO Rajesh Gopinathan's salary doubled to Rs 12 crore during the same period.

Infosys' top boss Salil Parekh, who took over in January 2018, can potentially earn up to Rs 34.45 crore a year given he achieves targets set for him by the management.

Wipro's Abidali Neemuchwala's salary rose over 34 percent in FY18 to Rs 18.2 crore.

The highest paid CEO among IT services firms is however, Tech Mahindra's CP Gurnani, who took home Rs 146.19 crore in 2017-18.

HCL Chairman and Chief Strategy Officer Shiv Nadar's salary during the year 2017-18, was 66.25 percent lower than the previous year.

In FY18, Nadar's remuneration was Rs 1.64 crore, down from Rs 10.30 crore in the year ago period. While this represents an 84 percent fall, the annual report said the 66.25 percent was arrived at by taking into account the remuneration Nadar received from other units of the company.

More crorepatis

HCL Technologies, now the third largest IT services company in India, had 28 ""crorepati"" employees (excluding CVK), up from 23 full time employees who were paid in excess of a crore in FY17.

The highest paid after CEO Vijayakumar is Chief Financial Officer Anil Chanana, who took home a salary of Rs 4.74 crore in FY17-18.

In addition to his salary, Chanana received Rs 3.32 crore as remuneration from a subsidiary of the company, the annual report said.

Chanana, who has been the CFO of HCL Technologies since 1998, is set to retire at the end of the year.

Anant Gupta, CEO Vijayakumar's predecessor, received Rs 8.18 crores in the current financial year in full and final settlement of his dues. He quit HCL in October 2016.

Other crorepatis include Maninder Singh Narang, the corporate vice president, infrastructure delivery, APMEA / Europe, who was paid Rs 3.87 crore during the year and Ajit Krishnankutty Kumar, President - Systems Integration & Applications, Delivery, who drew a salary of Rs 2.8 crore.

Others with a salary above Rs 1.2 crore include Amit Roy, Executive Vice President - Taxation; GH Rao, president engineering and R&D services; Apparao VV, Chief Human Resources Officer and Vineet Vedprakash Sood, Executive Vice President."
"August 21, 2018 05:02 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/ex-staffer-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-hcl-tech-for-discrimination-against-americans-2865791.html,"The fee hike is set to be implemented from October 2, 2020

An ex-employee of HCL Technologies in the United States has filed a class action complaint against the company, alleging that the IT major favours South Asians, mainly Indians, over Americans.

Last week, California-based The Mercury News and the web portal law.com reported that Texas resident Reese Voll has filed a class action complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California.

Voll, who joined HCL Technologies in November 2014, has alleged in his complaint, a copy of which was provided by law.com, that HCL promoted and chose H-1B visa holders to work on projects, most of whom are Indians.

At the time of publishing, HCL Technologies had not responded to a request for comment from Moneycontrol.

Daniel Low, the attorney for Kotchen & Low who has filed the complaint, told Moneycontrol in an email response, ""The key allegations are that HCL discriminates against non-South Asians in hiring, promotions and terminations in four ways.""

These include using fraudulent H-1B visa applications to secure South Asian workers from overseas and giving preference to those workers ahead of American workers.

""HCL gives substantial preference to South Asian applicants when hiring for local positions in the US... HCL consistently promotes more South Asian employees than their non-South Asian counterparts... HCL benches and terminates non-South Asians at disproportionately higher rates. At least 70 percent of HCL’s employees are South Asian, despite South Asians making up about 12 percent of the US IT industry,"" Low added.

The complaint notes that HCL submits visa petitions for more positions than actually exist in the US subsidiary of the company. ""This is to maximize its chances of securing the highest number of available H-1B visas from the lottery process. In this way, HCL has been able to secure visas for far more individuals than it actually has a present need for,"" the plaintiff Voll has alleged in the complaint.

Voll was initially part of HCL's contract with PepsiCo, and was put on bench or given unassigned project status in July 2016. When he told his superiors he was told he would be working on other projects as well, he was asked to contact human resources.

As per HCL's policy, an employee is terminated after being on bench for 30 days. While some initial conversations to join a few projects happened, none fructified and Voll as asked to quit in August 2016.

Voll has further claimed that he applied for open job roles within HCL between 2016 and 2018 several times, but was not hired for any role in spite of being adequately qualified.

The Indian IT industry has been accused of misusing the H-1B work visas, the most popular route for IT employees to work in the US.

The industry has consistently denied this claim and all top four IT companies- Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCL and Wipro- have spoken about hiring more Americans but the issue remains a thorny one with President Donald Trump's regime cracking down heavily on H-1B misuse by making the process more stringent and also increasing the number of checks.

Low said he has been involved in similar litigation against Infosys, TCS and US-based Cognizant.

Last year, a former employee of Infosys, Erin Green had filed a Green had filed a lawsuit alleging that Infosys favoured employees who are of South Asian, especially Indian descent.

Similarly, a federal judge in Oakland, California expanded a 2015 case into a class action against TCS, on behalf of American workers who lost their jobs at TCS offices in the US because they hadn’t been assigned to any of its clients.

HCL Technologies has for long held that it does not depend on H-1B visas as much as before.

The complaint says that HCL employees 12,000 people in the US, but received 10,432 new H-1B visas between 2015 and 2017.

Voll has also alleged that HCL Technologies promotes South Asians (Indians) and terminates non-South Asians disproportionately."

JM Financial's research report on HCL Tech

HCL reported organic revenue growth in 1QFY19 a tad below our estimates, likely on higher than expected pricing resets in some of the extant large contracts/renewals + delays in the start of new deals. However, a strong order booking (‘highest-ever’) should help the growth recover through 2Q-4QFY19. Management’s stance was incrementally positive and improved disclosures, especially on the IP partnerships, should help increase investors’ confidence, more so, given the stock’s inexpensive valuations – at c.13x FY20F EPS, HCL trades at 27%/5% discount to INFO/TECHM. A 4% dividend + buyback yield also limits the downside risk.

Outlook

Maintain BUY with INR 1,190 PT (INR 1,180 earlier).

The last week was all about the technology services sector in the country, and the coming week promises to continue the action.

On Friday, the country’s second largest software exporter Infosys reported fourth quarter and annual results, and continued its reign of being at the centre of controversies.

While it posted results in line with analyst estimates, the company made a slew of other announcements that will see chatter during the coming weeks.

The new CEO Salil Parekh spoke about his four-pillared strategy for the company, Infosys acquired a new consumer insights and digital agency called WongDoody.

The company said it would hive off three acquisitions made by Vishal Sikka, the previous CEO, including Panaya, an Israeli software firm that was at the heart of a public spat between him and the founders of Infosys last year.

On Saturday, a whistleblower wrote to the Indian and US market regulators asking them to fix the responsibility of the Infosys board in the Panaya acquisition, in which the same whistleblower (according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Moneycontrol) had alleged impropriety by the Board.

HCL Technologies, the fourth largest IT services provider made it second acquisition in as many weeks. On Thursday, the company said it was acquiring Actian Corporation, a Palo Alto based hybrid data management and analytics provider in a joint venture with Sumeru Partners in an all cash deal for USD 330 million.

The coming week is likey to see more action, with mid sized IT firm Mindtree reporting results on Wednesday and Tata Consultancy Services reporting on Thursday.

Analysts have said they expect mid sized firms to continue to post better growth than their larger peers, who have been growing at around 2 percent.

The commentary on the banking industry, which has been weak for IT firms since the past year, was tepid from Infosys, but COO UB Pravin Rao said there was no larger macro trend affecting the sector and things might pick up later in the year.

TCS’s commentary on the sector will also be keenly watched. Digital spends, which have been rising for companies for a while now, are also a trend to watch out for.

The US immigration services agency also announced that it had received 190,098 petitions this year for the H-1B visa this year, lesser than the 199,000 it received in the last filing season.

The visas are the most popular means for IT professionals to go to the US and the industry has been accused of misusing these work permits, a claim which it has consistently denied.

As a result of the US tightening controls around the visa application and allotment process in the past year, the total number of petitions filed has fallen."

HCL Technologies is going to invest Rs 1,500 crore in Uttar Pradesh over the next two to three years, including its rural development initiative Samuday.

Earlier this week, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath extended support to Samuday, which has an investment outlay of Rs 110 crore, and is an initiative to create model villages. It has impacted around 6 lakh people in 90,000 households across 720 villages through various interventions in the fields of education, agriculture, health, water, sanitation and hygiene, infrastructure and livelihood.

HCL Foundation, the corporate social responsibility arm of HCL Technologies, launched Samuday in 2015. Currently the project is being implemented in three blocks of Hardoi district of Uttar Pradesh.

“I congratulate HCL for launching ‘Samuday’ in Uttar Pradesh. It makes me proud that HCL, which started its journey from Uttar Pradesh and is now grown into a global conglomerate, has chosen Uttar Pradesh for its biggest CSR project. I am confident that the spirit with which the project is being implemented will certainly help the last man on the ground,” CM Adityanath said at the launch event.

The main aim of the initiative is to create sustainable and model villages and job creation.

“HCL Samuday will help us bring a positive impact through its various interventions in the areas of education, livelihood, health, infrastructure, wash and sanitation and agriculture. We thank Uttar Pradesh government for their continued encouragement and support,” said Navpreet Kaur, Director, Project Samuday.

In a little over two years, Samuday, has set up over 380 information and communication technology-based classrooms and enrolled 1865 people for adult literacy programme. It has also engaged 5,000 farmers under various interventions and has constructed 5,500 toilets, which are currently under usage.

In addition, 49 mini solar grids are being set up across 63 villages. Through various preventive, promotive and curative health services we have been able to support 2000 pregnant females and 7000 severly acute malnourished children. There has been a marked improvement in the nutrition intake of the village communities through the concept of Nutrition Garden in every third household of the village.

“We, at HCL Foundation, believe that positive social change can be brought by innovative and creative models of development. Our proximity to the place from where we started our journey makes Uttar Pradesh the right fit for the project to begin. This project is not about driving changes in the rural sector as an external partner but taking communities with us in this transformational journey. We feel that through the Samuday model, we will be able to develop a blueprint that is sustainable, scalable and replicable throughout the world,” said Roshni Nadar Malhotra, Chief Executive Officer, HCL Corporation and Chairperson of the CSR Committee for the HCL Technologies Board."
"November 09, 2017 06:53 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/hcl-tech-survey-finds-wide-gap-between-digital-strategy-implementation-2434413.html,"There exists a wide gap between strategy and execution with organisations’ digital transformation initiatives, a study of HCL Technologies’ global CXO Survey has found.

As many as 70 percent of organisations surveyed had a formalised digital transformation strategy in place, and just a fraction of that number — 10 percent have thought through all aspects up to full deployment planning.

These findings come at a time when digital transformation has emerged as a defining strategy for modern global enterprises.

“Enterprises are moving away from sporadic strategy and POCs (proof of concept) to more comprehensive digital execution. One of the biggest findings of this survey was the gap between the strategy and execution as well as measurable outcomes,” said Anand Birje, CVP and head – digital and analytics practice, HCL Technologies.

The research highlights some of the factors that demonstrate the growing gap between digital transformation strategy and execution.

The survey was conducted by market research company Vanson Bourne for HCL Technologies and in collaboration with HCL’s multi–channel thought leadership platform for C–level Technology executives called Straight Talk.

Shiv Nadar's decision to continue as the Chairman and Managing Director of HCL Tech has not gone down well with the shareholders, reports the Livemint. Last month, Nadar's tenure was extended for a five-year period.

Nadar also hasn't spoken about when he intends to step down, which is another point of contention with the shareholders.

The issue comes on the back of recent recommendations by the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Last week, the SEBI-appointed panel suggested that roles of chairman and managing director or chief executive officer should be split in listed company with more than 40 percent public shareholding.

As per the report, 13.185 percent public shareholders opposed reappointment of Nadar as the managing director. Nadar's family owns 59.88 percent in HCL while retail shareholders and public institutions hold 40.12 percent in the company.

During the same meeting, five other resolutions regarding reappointment of independent director and share buyback were passed by unanimous voting. For this reason, some shareholders believe that not all were happy with Nadar's reappointment, the Mint report said.

It further said that one foreign proxy advisory firm — Glass Lewis & Co. LLC — asked shareholders to vote against reappointment of Nadar as he is a non-retiring director.

One of the top-20 shareholders of HCL — who owns 0.35 percent — said that it is better to split the roles as most companies listed in India are controlled by promoters groups.

Glass Lewies, in a note to shareholders, said that an independent chairman would be ""able to oversee the executives of the company and set a pro-shareholder agenda without the management conflicts that a managing director or other executive insider often faces."""

Foreign investors which turned net sellers in the October-December quarter largely on account of concerns about a possible rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, as well as demonetisation, will soon shift back to India, Jonathan Schiessl of Ashburton said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

Indian market is no longer cheap after 10 per cent rally so far in the year 2017 and about 17 per cent in the current financial year. But, elevated valuation concerns are unlikely to dampen investor interest, assures Schiessl.

He further added that if we look at India from the perspective of dollar returns, India has been a massive outperformer backed by strength in the rupee.

Jonathan Schiessl who is the fund manager of the Ashburton India Equity Opportunities Fund gave a return of over 90 percent since its launch in 2012.

Ashburton India Equity Opportunities Fund is a USD-denominated fund offering investors access to one of the largest, fastest-growing and most exciting economies in the world.

The top ten holdings of the Ashburton India Equity Opportunities Fund include names like HDFC, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Tube Investments, Arvind, Tata Motors, Power Grid, Godrej Industries, Capital First, and Sun Pharma.

Here are excerpts of various stocks from his interview with CNBC-TV18:

Infosys, HCL Tech: Ashburton India Equity Opportunities Fund increased their weightage in the IT sector recently largely because these companies have better cash management, demand environment is improving for most of them and most of the worries on account Trump policies are priced in.

HDFC: HDFC has been one of the most consistent performers in the Indian market and we are comfortable to hold HDFC in our portfolio, said Schiessl. From a valuation perspective, HDFC is not cheap but from opportunity perspective, it has tremendous potential.

It is a great long and medium term structural story because it has scaled to grasp the opportunity as India transitions from informal economy to formal economy.

Capital First: The recent entrant in the housing finance segment is Capital First and is more diverse play. “We have been adding Capital First in the midst of demonetisation, but we should have been a little bit more aggressive,” said Schiessl.

Endurance Technologies: Endurance is an interesting play and a unique stock from an Indian perspective and we continue to hold the stock, he said.

KKR Mills: We just included KKR Mills in our portfolio, although we hold a small position right now. “There are so many well-managed companies in the mid and smallcap range which is looking attractive,” said Schiessl.

D-Mart: D-Mart looked interesting when the IPO came out. We have been reviewing the retail sector for a while but haven’t pulled the trigger yet, said Schiessl. “The stock was massively oversubscribed and raced to eye-watering valuations. If it corrects significantly, we would be looking at adding the stock,” he said."

HCLT will repurchase 3.5 crore shares (2.45% of its equity) at Rs 1,000 per share (16% premium to closing price of Rs 863 on March 20, 2017). While the buyback should be broadly EPS neutral, the return ratio should improve, going forward, with better cash utilisation.

Outlook

We are maintaining our BUY stance with a target price of Rs 950 owing to relatively higher growth rate along with modest valuations. We expect HCLT to report revenue, PAT CAGR of 13.3%, 6.7% in FY15- 18E with average 20.1% EBIT margins in FY17-18E led by order book conversion, IP-led revenue contribution and steady execution.

HCL Technologies, India’s fourth largest software exporter, is tackling this challenge by increasing its hiring in its largest market.“We have really looked at our current base of employees and then we have really looked at which part of those could be really replaced by local hiring,"" the company's President and Chief Executive Officer C Vijayakumar said after the company announced its third quarter earnings. ""'The second thing is we are stepping up our campus hiring and entry-level hiring in the US to support some of the growth that we will see in the coming quarters.Even so, Vijayakumar isn’t too perturbed by the protectionist stance of the new regime in the US, saying its dependence on H1B visas is much less than that of its peers. He put the number of H1B visas applied for by the company at less than 1,000 every year.He said a very large percentage of HCL’s US staff count comprised local hires – more than half - and not necessarily people who moved from India on visas. “We are generally focused on higher end skills where the availability is not there in the US geography,""' he said. ''That’s where we look at using the H1Bs. That’s why our employee cost is higher for our H1B employees compared to a lot of our peer group."" The company derives around 60 percent of its revenues from the Americas, the bulk of that coming from the US. Vijayakumar said he considered Trump a business-friendly person and while there would be some pros and cons of some of his decisions, largely they would be business-friendly.“The need for the services will continue to be there,"" he said. ''Who is going to do it? Somebody has to do it.

India's IT and outsourcing companies congratulated Donald Trump his winning the US Presidential Elections, in a move to build bridges with the Republican Party nominee.

India’s apex association for IT companies Nasscom which has members such as Infosys, HCL Tech, TCS, Microsoft, Wipro and others, tried to allay fears of tech outsourcing firms which were concerned on capping on work visas if Trump came to power. All Indian IT companies rely heavily on US H1B and L1 visas to send workers for onshore work.

""We congratulate President-elect Trump. Many of his observations during the campaign concerning high-skilled immigration and outsourcing were based on fabrications put out by critics of the sector,” said a statement from lobby firm Nasscom.

“We are optimistic that President-elect Trump’s administration will focus on making the strategic relationship with India a high priority including providing a boost to US India bilateral trade and investment,” the association said.

Trump recently said that, if he is elected, the US and India would be “best friends.”

Last month, he also vowed to protect jobs for Americans.

""Many mothers across this country are worried their kids won't find jobs, and they are right to be worried. One of the biggest threats is outsourcing jobs for college-educated kids are being sent to other countries,"" Trump said, last month.

""At the same time, companies are importing low-wage workers on H-1B visas to take jobs from young college-trained Americans,"" he had alleged."

Such a loss of Republican control is certainly a prospect that cannot be dismissed out of hand given that committed Trump supporters may well opt not to vote for Republican Congressional candidates who have chosen not to back the Republican nominee, he feels.

Such a Democratic landslide would in Greed & Fear's view not be liked by the stock market given the likely increase in taxation and regulation it would entail, says Wood.

Sharekhan's research report on HCL TechFor Q3FY2016, HCL Technologies (HCL Tech) has reported a weaker-than-expected revenue growth of 1.3% QoQ at $1,587.2 million on a reported basis and 1.7% Q-o-Q growth on a constant-currency (CC) basis (weaker growth rate on lower base as compared with Infosys [1.9%] and TCS [2.1%]). The lower-thanexpected revenue growth was attributed to some project closures in the BFSI space and some slow ramp-ups. The IMS services grew by 3.9% QoQ (in line with our expectation), IT services grew by 0.7% QoQ, while BPO declined by 4.1% QoQ on a CC basis. The increasing complexity deals engagement (slower deal conversion) and integration of headwinds will result in volatile earnings performance in FY2017. Further, lack of conviction in management commentary on the organic growth front, ex Volvo in Q1FY2017 and absence of margins guidance, will affect the near-term stock’s performance. We have revised our estimates down for FY2017 and FY2018 by 7% and 2% respectively. We expect, after near-term hiccups and volatility, margins performance will start showing improvement with deals reaching steady state (also reflects in revenue growth), which will be the most important rerating trigger for HCL Tech. The stock is trading at inexpensive valuation of 14x and 12x its FY2017E and FY2018E earnings. We have maintained our Buy rating on the stock with a revised price target of Rs950.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

The acquired business generates ~USD140mn revenue with 15% EBIDTA margin and 9% PAT margin as per the company’s last quarterly report. In our view, the acquisition gives HCLT access to Geometric’s 60 plus clients broadly in the auto and engineering space and will strengthen the former’s ER&D practice, especially in PLM and digital manufacturing domain. Though we anticipate the deal to marginally impact HCLT’s earnings, we envisage it to further augment the ER&D vertical. Maintain ‘BUY’. At CMP, the stock is attractively valued at 15.7x/13.0x FY16E/FY17E EPS. ER&D is the growth driver for HCLT along with IMS and the deal further strengthens it.

ICICIDirect's research report on HCL TechLast week, HCL Tech announced an agreement to acquire (through demerger) all of the business of Geometric Ltd, except for an 58% stake that Geometric owns in the JV – 3DPLM Software Solutions Ltd, with Dassault Systems. HCLT would issue 10 equity shares of | 2 each to Geometric shareholders for every 43 equity shares of Geometric held by them. In total, HCLT will issue 1.56 crore equity shares of | 2 each. This implies a value of | 1,280 crore assuming HCLT’s April 1, 2016 close. Though HCLT argues the deal is synergistic and cash earnings per share accretive, we believe, deal valuations are rich. The deal values Geometric ex-3DPLM business at 1.4x annualised FY16E sales and appears rich. Further, the business operates at below HCLT’s average EBIT margins. Finally, growth has been modest as ex-3D PLM business grew at 0.8% CQGR in the past 10 quarters (refer exhibit 1). HCL expects to close the transaction by the October-December quarter. The transaction is likely to alter FY18E estimates given HCLT shifts to fiscal year-end (vs. current June) from FY17 onwards. We await clarity before upgrading our estimates and hence continue to expect HCLT to report revenue, PAT CAGR of 12%, 11%, respectively, in FY15-17E with average 21.2% EBIT margins. Growth will be supported by healthy deal wins – HCLT signed deals with total contract value in excess of $ 1 billion for thirteen consecutive quarters. We value the shares at 16x FY17E EPS of | 63 to arrive at our target price of | 1,000.

Consequently, the dollar rallied across the board in particular against Euro while US stocks also showed decent recovery.""""USD-INR is likely to trade marginally weaker today and is expected to be in a range of 64.90-65.20/dollar,"" he added.The dollar stood near a 2 and a half month high against a basket of currencies after the US fed left the door open for a rate hike in December, while the European Central Bank is widely expected to add to its stimulus.

Globally, the Federal Reserve has left the door open for December indicating that the chances of a December rate hike have increased as growth picks up. The Nasdaq led gains with a 1.3 percent rise, while the Dow Jones and S&P 500 closed up 1.1 and 1.2 percent respectively.

Asian stocks mostly advanced today, encouraged by a positive Wall Street handover following the Fed's decision to leave interest rates near zero."

Emkay's reserach report on HCL TechHCL Tech has corrected by ~16% over the past five trading sessions after the Sep’15 quarter revenue warning. A tepid growth outlook for Sep’15 quarter on account of transition delays in some large Infrastructure deals along with revenue reversals in a Public Services client have led to concerns on the moderating revenue growth trajectory for the company and a likely risk to management’s outlook of 21-22% EBIT margin for FY16. While we do acknowledge the moderation in revenue growth trajectory, we highlight that this is true across the sector with the YoY revenue growth trajectory for the Tier I players moderating through last several quarters with Sep’15 quarter expected to be the 7th quarter in a row of moderation. Further HCL Tech’s investments in onsite hiring, global delivery presence is expected to drive better positioning to address énd to end’ deals in areas like Engineering Services and ‘integrated Applications and Infra’ opportunity. We note that this has also helped bring more stability to ‘lop sided’ IMS led growth for HCL Tech through FY12-14 (IMS accounted for 40% of incremental revenue addition in FY15 as compared to accounting for nearly 2/3rd of incremental revenue addition over FY12-14). We find valuations attractive after the recent corrections and advocate adding positions given ‘relative margin of safety in valuations’ at ~13x FY17E P/E. Upgrade to BUY, TP Rs 1,000.

Banks are weak. Credit Suisse recommended reducing weight on Indian Banks and selling corporate lenders including SBI and PNB. They have cut the target price of the likes of Axis Bank and ICICI Bank and downgraded Bank of Baroda and Yes Bank to neutral. SBI, HDFC Bank and HDFC fell 0.8-1.5 percent.

In the broader space, Lanco Infratech climbed 5.5 percent as the company has successfully completed sale of 1200 MW Udupi power plant to Adani Power. However, Ramco Systems cracked 5 percent as the company reported revenue growth of 4 percent with EBITDA declining 14 percent, margin at 19 percent (against 23 percent Y-o-Y) and profit down 46 percent Y-o-Y to Rs 43.5 crore.

10:25am Market Expert: The political tussle taking place in the parliament over important business-evolving Bills like the Land Acquisition Bill is taking its toll on the market, says Sandeep Bhatia, Executive Director & Head Of Sales at Kotak Institutional Equities.

In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Bhatia says the Indian industry should be allowed to expand by easy acquisition of land and the ongoings in the parliament act as a huge headwind for the Nifty.

The other headwind, he adds, is the Q4 earnings that are on the expected lines of a slowdown. But if the earnings continue to lag growth, then information technology will be the best sector to be in, he says.

10:00am Market Check

The market remained under pressure amid volatility. The Sensex fell 126.43 points to 27759.78 and the Nifty declined 46.25 points to 8401.85. About 855 shares have advanced, 991 shares declined, and 131 shares are unchanged on the BSE.

Sun Pharma topped the selling list on Sensex, down nearly 10 percent as the compnay saw multiple blocks on BSE and NSE at Rs 930-Rs 968 per share with Daiichi Sankyo as the likely seller.

HCL Technologies reacted negatively to its third quarter earnings. The stock fell 7 percent as the company reported a miss on all counts with dollar revenue at USD 1.49 billion against estimates of USD 1.5 billion and rupee revenue down 0.2 percent Q-o-Q for the quarter. The constant currency growth was 2.7 percent Q-o-Q against estimates of 3 percent and the margin decline was sharper than estimates with EBIT margins declining to 21.33 percent against estimates of 22.58 percent with profit down 12.1 percent to Rs 1,683 crore.

Wipro too slipped 3 percent ahead of its numbers today. The street is expecting a dollar revenue to decline 0.2 percent with EBIT margins at 20.74 percent against 21.77 percent Q-o-Q.

Tata Sponge Iron plunged over 8 percent after the company reported a decline of 25 percent in total income to Rs 160.3 crore with EBITDA down 105 percent to Rs 1.7 crore and profit down 79 percent to Rs 8.57 crore Y-o-Y."

9:55 am FII view: With tax authorities asking FPIs to pay minimum alternate tax (MAT), the threat of FIIs turning away has become a reality, warns emerging markets fund manager at Franklin Templeton Investments Mark Mobius. On Monday, fears of retrospective taxation triggering an outflow from foreign portfolio investors slashed 555 points off the BSE benchmark. Nevertheless, Mobius does not find it unusual to see sharp corrections in a bull market. ""Earlier a 10 percent slide would rattle markets, but not anymore,"" he said adding that a further cut of over 5-10 percent won't be unexpected. ""This is just a correction and not a bear market. These corrections give an opportunity for investors to get into good quality stocks"" he adds in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

9:40 am Market check: The market recovers from the initial jerk. The Sensex is down 5.41 points at 27880.80 and the Nifty is down 16.10 points or at 8432.00. About 910 shares have advanced, 553 shares declined, and 112 shares are unchanged. Sun Pharma is down 11 percent while HCL Tech slips 7 percent. Wipro, Cipla, Maruti and Dr Reddy's Labs are major losers in the Sensex.

9:30 am Earnings impact: Missing street expectations on all parameters, the IT company’s consolidated net profit fell 12 percent sequentially (up 3.6 percent year-on-year) to Rs 1,683 crore, impacted by adverse cross currency in Q3.

Abhishek Shindadkar, IT Analyst, ICICI Securities says its constant currency is better than what they did in Q3 FY14. Constant currency growth in dollar revenue was 2.7 percent Q-o-Q and and 15.4 percent Y-o-Y in January-March quarter.

Vikas Khemani of Edelweiss Financial Services advises to stay invested in the stock for long-term returns. He says HCL has been delivering a good set of numbers for a few quarters; it is not unusual to see a lean period once in a while. Most of the IT firms are spending money on new technology and that shift may be reflected in the numbers.

In other asset classes, the dollar rose broadly, with the euro sliding against the US currency, on growing concern that Greece may default on debts.

10:30am L&T bags order: L&T secured a turnkey order from NTPC for setting up a 2x660 MW greenfield ultra-supercritical thermal power plant in Khargone district of Madhya Pradesh on EPC basis.

Valued over Rs 5,580 crore, the project entails design, engineering, manufacture, supply, erection and commissioning of two coal-fired thermal units of 660 MW each with ultrasupercritical parameters, said the company in its filing to the exchange.

02:30pm Star Ferro Cement on broker's radar: SFCL is the largest cement player in the North-East region (NER) with over 23 percent market share.

Demand growth in this region has consistently remained higher than the growth at pan-India level. In order to reduce imports, the company has expanded its capacity from 1.5MT in FY13 to 3.6 MT in FY15. This, in turn, has helped SFCL to gain market share in the NER.

With the government’s thrust on infrastructure development, ICICIdirect expects demand growth in this region to remain healthy over the next 3-4 years. Given this backdrop, the brokerage expects the company to clock revenue CAGR of 25.5 percent in FY15-17E.

Infosys market-cap has surged only 7 percent in last three years as company lagged its peers with slower revenue growth, falling margins, higher attrition rate and reluctance to avoid big ticket acquisitions and sticking to old strategies.

TCS market-cap is 115 percent higher compared to Infosys today while the difference was merely 7% in 2011. TCS topped Infy as IT bellwether and surprised the street every quarter with its consistent strong performance despite weak macro environment in US and UK in 2011 and 2012.

HCL Tech has emerged as a dark horse in the entire pack trebling its market-cap in last three years. Improved business strategies, strong leadership, acquisition of higher bracket clients and clocked higher EBIT margins over the years.

Infosys current market-cap of Rs 214078 crore is less than TCS market-cap in Jan 2011 (Rs 226656 cr). Infosys has not even managed to cross TCS market-cap (in 2011) in last three years. TCS current market-cap is more than combined total market-cap of remaining 18 CNX IT stocks (barring Infosys)

In 2011, TCS market-cap was 14% higher compared to Infy. Today TCS market-cap is 115% higher compared to Infy.

Infosys market-cap has surged only 7% in last three years. It has underperformed 14 IT stocks in CNX IT index in last three years.

The difference of market-cap between Wipro (3rd largest) and HCL Tech (4th largest) was 74% in 2011. Today the gap between two has narrowed to 32%.

Tech Mahindra's market-cap was less than that of Mphasis in Jan 2011. Today, Tech Mahindra's market-cap is 5 times that of Mphasis. In 2011, Mphasis was 6th largest company in terms of market-cap and today Tech Mahindra is 5th largest while Mphasis is 7th.

Tech Mahindra’s market-cap was less than combined market-cap of MindTree, Vakrangee, Hexaware, CMC and KPIT. Today Tech Mahindra’s market-cap has nearly doubled the combined market-cap of MindTree, Vakrangee, Hexaware, CMC and KPIT. Vakrangee’s market-cap has surged from Rs 700 cr in (Jan 2011) to Rs 4700 cr (nearly 600%) in last three years. In 2011, Vakrangee was not even a part of CNX IT index and today its 10th largest IT stock in terms of market-cap (Top 10 IT stocks). Only 5 CNX IT stocks out of 20 have posted negative returns in last three years.

Core Education has lost 91% of its market-cap in last three years. (From midcap it has become smallcap stock)"

03:55 pm Opinion: Jim O Neill, former chairman, Goldman Sachs Asset Management is confident that world economies will improve in 2014 and sees them growing 3-4 percent this year. Global institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank are optimistic that global growth will pick up this year .

The latter expects global growth to strengthen to 3.2 percent this year, 3.4 percent in 2015, and 3.6 percent in 2016 - up from 2.4 percent in 2013. Also, it sees India growing to over 6 percent in FY2014-15, and accelerating to 7.1 percent by FY2016-17.

Continuing the bullish tone, Neill told CNBC-TV18 that one is now seeing some signs of improvement seen in Indian economic data, which is boosting sentiment. “I would not be surprised if people talk about 8-9% India GDP growth for 2015. Also, change in leadership at RBI is a big positive,” he said in an interview.

03:40 pm Market closing: The market closed on a flat note but Nifty managed to hold the 6300-level. The Sensex was down 24.31 points at 21265.18, and the Nifty ended at 6318.90, down 2.00 points. About 1149 shares have advanced, 1486 shares declined, and 261 shares are unchanged.

Metal and IT stocks lend support to the indices while auto and some banking stocks were weak. With a gain of 3 percent, Coal India was the biggest gainer in the Sensex followed by Hindalco, Wiprom HDFc and BHEL. Among the losers were Bharti Airtel, Tata Motors, Sun Pharma, ONGC and Cipla.

03:30 pm Big relief! In a major relief to the government, Moody’s in its latest report has said that India’s rating downgrade is not on the cards. Moody's has given India an investment grade rating of Baa3 with a stable outlook. This follows the World Bank report which projected India’s growth to rise to over 6 percent in FY2014-15 followed by 7.1 percent growth in FY2016-17.

The rating agency expects inflation and interest rates to decline and sees a slow economic recovery in the July-December period. It sees the General Elections outcome may affect the growth.

03:20 pm Stock in news: Shares in Ranbaxy Laboratories gained as reports the company has partnered with an unnamed multinational drug maker to procure API, or active pharmaceutical ingredient, for a generic version of an anti-hypertension drug, citing unnamed sources.

HSBC notes that sourcing API could potentially mean reduced profits for Ranbaxy, but would help increase confidence on cash flow generation.

03:10 pm Boardroom: Calling it a strong and balanced growth that showed up across businesses and verticals, HCL Technologies CEO Anant Gupta said the firm's impressive second-quarter showing could be attributed to a renewed focus on clients and introducing efficiencies within the firm.

CFO Anil Chanana said the wage hike was offset by greater efficiencies and savings on depreciation and general and administrative expenses and a general

“The company has started a shift in the business model from time and material services to outcome-based services. The new model is risky but if you know it well, it supports high margins,” CEO Gupta said.

02:55pm Wipro to declare Q3 earnings on Friday

Investors will closely eye India's third-largest technology services firm Wipro's third-quarter earnings due Friday to gain insights into how much its turnaround strategy has made progress.

A CNBC-TV18 poll of analysts expects the company's operating profits to rise 5.7 percent to Rs 2,393 crore compared to Rs 2,264 crore in the previous quarter. Revenues are expected to go up to Rs 10,332 crore versus Rs 10,068 crore, an increase of 2.6 percent.

In dollar terms, revenue is expected to rise 2.8 percent to USD 1,677 million from USD 1,631.1 million in the September quarter. This is the midpoint of the company's forecast in the last quarter, which stood at USD 1,660-1,690 million.

If the company meets its guidance, this will be its second quarter of sustained growth and would likely indicate the company is putting behind the problematic two years it faced after 2010, when annual earnings per share growth came in about flat.

Wipro has since initiated a slew of restructuring initiatives, including hiving off its consumers business in a bid to streamline operations and focus on the IT business.

In the earnings season so far, peers Infosys and HCL Tech have reported stronger-than-expected earnings with dollar revenue growth rising 1.65 percent and 4 percent, respectively. IT companies have benefited from a general pick-up in global IT spending as developed economies recover from global financial crisis.

02:45pm South Indian Bank up 2.5 percent post earnings

Improved asset quality, lower provisions and higher other income helped private sector lender South Indian Bank to report 10.2 percent jump in its Q3 net profits. But, its net interest income (NII) declined marginally to Rs 350.5 crore in Q3 from Rs 352.6 crore in a year ago period.

Explaining this fall in NII, MD & CEO VA Joseph said the bank shifted its focus from corporate lending to retail lending, which led to slow pick-up in advances. However, he is confident of sustaining profitability going ahead. NII is the difference between interest earned and interest expended.

He pointed out that the bank’s recoveries were higher than slippages in Q3. Slippages stood a little over Rs 100 crore and recoveries were at Rs 160 crore. Meanwhile, the bank’s net interest margin stood at 3.03 percent.

Going forward, the bank would aggressively focus on recovery and aims to reduce its gross NPA and net NPA below 1.5 percent and 1 percent respectively by March.

02:35pm Jain Irrigation talks to CNBC-TV18

Jain Irrigation is expecting to report significant margin improvement in the seasonally strong fourth quarter, Anil Jain, MD told CNBC-TV18. ""Fourth quarter is sesaonally strong, almost 40 percent of our sales come through in this quarter and we are now seeing all our businesses clocking very good growth,"" Anil Jain, MD said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

It is also hopeful of clocking more than 25 percent growth in its standalone operations for FY14. He is also upbeat on export revenue growth and expects it be around Rs 1,000-1,100 crore for FY14.

Meanwhile, he said its total foreign exchange loan stands at USD 220 million, out of which around USD 100-110 million is unhedged. Further, he expects receivables to decline from the current 270 days to three months over the next few quarters.

02:25pm The market is completely lacklustre in afternoon trade as it seems to be looking for trigger to get direction on either side. The Sensex declined 4.38 points to 21,285.11 while the Nifty rose 7.90 points to 6,328.80.

The broader markets too are listless, though the market breadth is in favour of declines. Declining shares outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of 1456 to 1096 on the BSE.

Coal India, Infosys, Axis Bank, HCL Tech, Bharti Airtel and HDFC are most active shares on exchanges.

Coal India is the biggest gainer in the Sensex, rising 2.5 percent in addition to 2 percent in earlier session. The rally is after the company declared a special dividend of Rs 29 per share.

Shares of HDFC, Hindustan Unilever, Wipro, Tata Steel, Sesa Sterlite, BHEL, Hindalco Industries and NTPC gained between 1-2 percent.

However, Bharti Airtel plunged 5 percent, keeping its top position in the selling list after Credit Suisse downgraded the stock to neutral and cut target price to Rs 310 from Rs 420 apiece.

The brokerage house also downgraded Idea Cellular to underperform and cut target price to Rs 130 from Rs 190 apiece. The stock plunged 6.5 percent.

Tata Motors fell more than 2 percent followed by ITC, TCS, HDFC Bank, ONGC, Sun Pharma, Cipla and M&M with 0.5-1 percent."

2:00 pm Result: Motorcycle maker Bajaj Auto reported a better-than-expected 10.5 percent increase in quarterly net profit, helped by a foreign exchange gains and as higher revenues from exports helped offset weak demand for its vehicles.

The company, for whom exports contribute more than a third of sales, said net profit for the October-December quarter was Rs 905 crore, compared with Rs 819 crore a year ago. The company also benefited from a foreign exchange contract.

1:50 pm Boardroom:Jain Irrigation is expecting to report significant margin improvement in the seasonally strong fourth quarter, Anil Jain, MD told CNBC-TV18. ""Fourth quarter is sesaonally strong, almost 40 percent of our sales come through in this quarter and we are now seeing all our businesses clocking very good growth,"" Anil Jain, MD said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

Jain Irrigation won the India Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Award at the India Business Leaders Awards (IBLA). Seven percent of the company’s profit is spent on CSR activities. ""Development via increase in productivity is the key focus for CSR,"" Jain said.

1:40 pm Outlook: Jim O Neill, former chairman, Goldman Sachs Asset Management is confident that world economies will improve in 2014 and sees them growing 3-4 percent this year.

Continuing the bullish tone, Neill told CNBC-TV18 that one is now seeing some signs of improvement seen in Indian economic data, which is boosting sentiment. “I would not be surprised if people talk about 8-9 percent India GDP growth for 2015. Also, change in leadership at RBI is a big positive,” he said in an interview. Like most experts, he is also closely watching general elections, scheduled in May this year, and expects poll outcome to determine market movement in India.

1:30 pm Result: Private sector lender South Indian Bank 's third quarter (October-December) net profit climbed 10.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 141.3 crore, supported by improved asset quality, lower provisions and higher other income.

But net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, declined marginally to Rs 350.5 crore in the quarter ended December 2013 from Rs 352.6 crore in a year ago period due to higher expenses. Total expenses jumped nearly 17 percent on yearly basis to Rs 1,118.86 crore in the third quarter on higher employee cost and other operating expenses.

Don't miss: Bharti, Idea, RComm fall 2-5% on applying for spectrum auction

The market is sliding further third quarter earnings of companies start trickling in. The Sensex is down 49.34 points at 21240.15, and the Nifty slips 8.50 points at 6312.40. About 987 shares have advanced, 1458 shares declined, and 247 shares are unchanged.

HCLTech posts strong second quarter earnings. The company posted dollar revenue growth of 4 percent, which is the highest in the last eight quarters. All eyes are on TCS Q3 which is likely to again lead the sector on third quarter dollar revenue growth. Meanwhile, government sources say fiscal deficit is likely to be lower than projected 4.8 percent of GDP. The government is borrowing for FY14 to be lower by Rs 15,000 crore.

The rupee trades lower against the dollar tracking strength in the dollar globally on the back of US federal reserve officials comments and as risk appetite continued to remain poor after strong US retail sales data."

Investors will be keenly scrutinising the consumer price index (CPI) and wholesale price index (WPI) numbers for December 2013 to be declared on January 13 and January 15, respectively.

Bloomberg consensus estimate for CPI is 10.09 percent compared to 11.24 percent November reading. Similarly estimate for WPI is 7.00 percent compared to 7.52 percent November reading.

Also read: Five things that keep Goldman Sachs up at night

A lot depends on these numbers as regards to the future stance of Reserve Bank of India. The central bank governor, in the last meeting, had taken a dovish stance as far as interest rate is concerned based on the premise that inflation is expected to cool from the peaks of November readings.

Even as Raguram Rajan had left the field open for RBI intervention midway if the situation calls, the next date to be noted is when the RBI meets on January 28.

Focus will also be on third-quarter earnings that started on January 10, with key results from Infosys and IndusInd Bank. The key results to be declared this week are: Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, HCL Tech and TCS on January 16, and HDFC Bank, ITC, Reliance Industries and Wipro on January 17.

Apart from the results due to which stock-specific action may take place, the markets are expected to be range-bound with a downward bias as politics takes the centre stage in the run-up to the parliamentary elections due in May this year.

Investors are deeply concerned that the election may throw up a highly fragmented parliament leading to unstable ruling combination, which may result in more populism rather than following of a progressive reforms-oriented path by lawmakers.

Globally, it was a somewhat quieter last week following the routine jobs and central bank releases. In US too, the earnings will be on focus with consensus building up that the market is ripe for profit taking, and the earnings season is its first big test of the year. With no major data release from China, Eurozone is largely going to be focused upon the German constitutional hearing that has been shifted back from last week.

Bharat Iyer of JP Morgan: The dependence on global liquidity and quantitative easing tapering linked volatility will likely continue over Q1CY14. The result of the national election in May would play an important role in H2CY (January-June 2014) growth revival, particularly for the investment cycle and also for the performance of Indian equities. Our top picks have a cyclical bias. ICICI Bank and DLF are domestic cyclical expected to benefit from a revival in growth and modest valuations. We also expect global growth to accelerate into the year ahead which should benefit companies like Tata Motors, Tata Steel and HCL Technologies. Cyclical recovery makes us more cautious on expensive defensives, HUL and Colgate.

Neelkanth Mishra of Credit Suisse: We expect the divergence between the investment cycle and middle-income consumption on one hand and low-end consumption on the other to continue. Growth in the informal economy though should continue to drive wage growth for the poor. Indices have already started to reflect this divergence. Our model portfolio stays defensive with Reliance Industries, Godrej Consumer, HCL Technologies and ITC as top longs and Larsen and Toubro, Tata Steel and SBI as top shorts."

In an interview to CNBC-TV18 Mayuresh Joshi, Angel Broking cherry picked his bet best for 2014 from various sector.

IT

2013 was an exceptional year for IT and pharmaceutical. Lot of polarisation happened within the top tier companies. In 2014 as well, earnings growth will largely be dependent on export oriented sectors.

Angle Broking is bullish on HCL Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and believes that earnings growth in dollar and rupee terms will be exceptional for these companies. “With the US economy picking up and European markets stabilizing, discretionary spends on the IT side whether it be BFSI or the other sectors should grow going forward. It should support the EBITDA margins of both these companies within the top tier IT names,” he said.

From midcap IT, it sees huge potential in KPIT Cummins. “The management has indicated that it will outperform Nasscom estimates by a huge margin. It has been consistently delivering results over the past few quarters. Our expectations are that the revenue growth both in dollar and rupee terms for KPIT can be much better than the industry,” he said.

Pharma

One can buy largecaps Sun Pharma and Dr Reddys Laboratories on dips. From the midcap pharma space, Ipca Laboratories and Cadila Healthcare have huge potential. “Ipca Labs has utilization of Rs 80-100 crore in terms of bottom-line performance. It has got 36 ANDAs in the pipeline, 62 percent of its revenue contribution comes in from the export markets,” he added. Cadila Healthcare can also be placed in one’s portfolio as the company has got good pipeline of products, which can be revenue accretive.

FMCG

ITC, Britannia and Dabur are the broking firm’s best bets from this space. “We see tremendous growth in the rural markets. Especially in case of Dabur, we expect its juices business to do well. It has been able to maintain margins at 15-16 percent; volume growth has been pretty good between 10-12 percent. Valuation wise it is a little bit expensive at 34-35 times, but looking at growth coming from rural and urban areas, the stock is poised to do well, “he added.

Metal

From the metals pack, it is betting on Tata Steel. “We believe that the import substitution theory can play out very well for Tata Steel. It has been able to maintain that margins, growth and revenues in a tough economic environment from its European operations. Once the domestic macro economic conditions improve, Tata Steels domestic operations can aid and benefit from this move and again aid earnings growth going forward,” he said.

From the agro-chemical play, it is bullish on United Phosphorus. “The stock is not trading too expensively- it is at seven times FY15 earnings. The stock looks reasonable; buyback at Rs 220 will be a good support for the stock from a medium to long-term perspective,” he added."

IT industry veteran Vineet Nayar today stepped down from the board of country's fourth largest software services firm, HCL Technologies, to devote more time to his foundation. Nayar, who has been a Director of the company since 2008, will continue to engage with HCL Technologies and HCL Corporation as a Senior Advisor, HCL Technologies said in a statement.

He will advise HCL Corporation on key strategic issues and work with the Board of HCL Technologies on initiatives like driving a high performance culture amongst senior managers and new strategies for growth.

""Vineet has been a friend and a colleague for over two decades now. His bold ideas and passion for the organisation, has inspired many others to think and dream big. ""His contribution to HCL and the Board has been a benchmark for others to follow and we all are very proud of him,"" HCL Technologies Chief Strategy Officer and Chairman Shiv Nadar said.

More than two decades after joining HCL Technologies, Nayar stepped down from the post of CEO in January this year to make way for the next generation of leaders to steer the company.

He, however, continued to work as Vice-Chairman and Joint Managing Director of the company.

""I am grateful to Shiv, Board Members and the employees of HCL Technologies, for giving me an opportunity to dream, learn, explore and experiment along with them. There are very few organisations where one could rise up the ranks and become the CEO and Vice Chairman,"" Nayar said.

Nayar had sold his entire stock holding in HCL Technologies for about Rs 134 crore in June 2012 and used the money for his non-profit organisation Sampark.

""As I pursue my dream, of creating a 'Million Smiles' through Sampark Foundation, I carry with me goodwill, best wishes and lots of learning,"" he said. Nayar had joined HCL in 1985 after getting his MBA from XLRI. He founded Comnet, where he incubated the remote infrastructure management (RIM) industry in 1993.

He is known for his 'employees first, customers second' philosophy, which became a core of HCL Technologies' policies and practices.

In 2005, Nayar became President of the company and it was under his leadership that the company expanded to become an USD 4 billion entity employing over 87,000 people across the globe."

Sectors which get very strong astrological support are not normally affected by downfall in the market.

V Balakrishnan, seen by Infosys insiders as CEO-in-waiting, Friday became the eighth senior executive to quit the company since founder Narayana Murthy's return in June this year. The development has raised questions about Murthy's ability, and some even say, intent, to fix the problem of senior talent attrition. This is worrying the stock market as it feels the absence of trusted old-timers could hamper Murthy's turnaround plan for the company.

Murthy himself said it would be hard to 'imagine an Infosys without Bala's commitment and passion’.

Also Read: Murthy's return is the best thing for Infy: V Balakrishnan

Balakrishnan, or Bala as he is known to friends and colleagues, headed Infosys's BPO business and the recently acquired consulting firm Lodestone, and has spent 22 years with the company.

The abrupt departure of Bala has surprised the industry and the stock market, especially since he was seen as Murthy's blue-eyed boy.

Bala's elevation as Lodestone chairman immediately after Murthy took charge as Infosys chairman was seen as a signal that Bala was going to be central to Murthy's blue-print to get the company back on track.

And when Ashok Vemuri, the other contender for the CEO spot, quit in August, Bala's eventual rise to the top was 'near certain', as one leading business daily put it.

Given this backdrop, Bala's decision to quit during a crucial phase for the company is all the more baffling.

Some churn in the senior management in Murthy's second innings was only to be expected given the change in power structure, but the pace and the number of exits are beginning to raise eyebrows. Eight exits in six months may not mean much for a company the size of Infosys with its vast pool of talent, but it could certainly impact staff morale and hurt investor perception in the short run.

Infosys shares Friday closed at its life time high of Rs 3352.30, and have gained nearly 47 percent in the last six months. But then, IT shares in general have done well during this period. A combination of weak rupee and recovery in demand improved sentiment for the sector.

It is hard to tell how much of a difference Murthy's return alone has made to the Infosys stock. Sentiment has played a major part, given Murthy's impeccable track record. And a few measures by Murthy, such as shifting focus to the unglamorous bread-and-butter IT outsourcing business and willingness to cut prices did boost revenues in the September quarter. And to be fair to Murthy, Infosys's growth woes will take a few more quarters to be fixed since the company's business model itself is in the midst of a complete overhaul. Murthy had said it would take him at least three years to rebuild the company.

But what is worrying the market is how soon the company will be able to achieve its target if experienced hands continue to jump ship at this rate.

Proxy advisory firm Ican Advisors' Anil Singhvi has been scathing in his attack on Murthy saying that the founder's return to Infosys was not viewed positively within the company and that he (Murthy) has not been able to attract fresh talent.

Senior officials who have quit since June include Basab Pradhan, Global Sales Head, Stephen Pratt, Head of Utilities and Resources for North America, Kartik Jayaraman, Head of Australia BPO sales, Humberto Andrade, BPO Head Latin America, Ashok Vemuri, head of Americas' operations and Sudhir Chaturvedi, Financial Services Head for the Americas.

Before the second quarter numbers were announced, many brokerages had raised the issue of senior level attrition, and at least one US-based brokerage had clearly mentioned it as the differentiating factor for choosing TCS over Infosys.

The better-than-expected second quarter numbers helped silence critics and also led to many brokerages raising their price targets and earnings estimates for the stock.

Opinion is divided on how much the ongoing exodus could hurt Infosys. IT research firm Offshore Insights feels attrition is not so much of a problem for Infosys as much as getting the company's business model right.

But sentiment could take a knock in the short run, since investors may prefer paying a premium for stocks with better earnings visibility and avoid those with even the slightest doubt of a nasty surprise. Also, Infosys shares are no longer as cheap as they were six months back.

The 47 percent rise in Infosys's share price since June has to be seen in the context of the performance of its rivals during the same period.

Earnings season kick starts this Friday and as usual Infosys will be the first off the block among the heavyweights. It's a stock which is notorious for big moves on results day and option traders are hugely active sometime around now to play for the result day move. Let’s just see what is being priced in.

First of all, I just looked at the charts of last 2 months and one thing that stands out is that Infosys has been stagnant around Rs 3,000 mark. During this period, TCS has moved up 9 percent, while HCL Tech has moved up a whopping 22 percent. Even year to date, HCL Tech leads with 77 percent gains, TCS is second with 62 percent and Infosys lags with 30 percent gains. Of course, it is still among the best performing Nifty stocks.Now, look at the valuations for FY14-end. TCS trades at 22x, HCL Tech is at 14x, and Infosys is in between at 16x. Of course, TCS deserves its premium for its consistency and HCL Tech still needs to do more work to bridge the gap.But what we are focusing on here is the pricing of Infosys options. Over the last three quarters, Infosys stock has moved by an average of 15 percent on results day. On result days, this was the trend: In January 2013, it rallied 17 percent, while in April 2013, it fell 18 percent and in July it rallied 11 percent.Anecdotally, it would have been a good strategy if you had bought Infosys at the money straddle – or in simple terms both call and put of same strike closer to the market price. But this strategy worked only in January and April because the moves were so sharp. In July, even after 11 percent move, the straddle buyer would have actually lost money and the reason is the spike in implied volatility. Look at the data for this month for example.The combined premium of Infosys 3000 Call and Put is Rs 400. Simply put, you need a move of over 13 percent on either direction to make money if you have bought this straddle. And what’s intriguing is that we are still 5 days from the results and in all likelihood, this premium may actually rise. The reason is the incredibly high implied volatility of 60 percent. So what should a trader do?Well, wait for this implied volatility to rise more and if it approaches 80 percent-90 percent which is not impossible, it just might make sense to actually sell this straddle on Thursday and you will still make money if the Infosys stock moves even 10-12 percent. Of course keep in mind, this strategy has a risk just in case the stock moves 20 percent or beyond."

Big IT firms such as TCS, Infosys and Wipro are expected to announce strong earnings for the July- September quarter, helped by a steep decline of the rupee against the US dollar and improved demand for outsourcing services, say analysts.

They also expect strong volume growth for companies, supported by the improving demand scenario.""Volumes for the top 4 companies are expected to rise by 2.5-4 percent, organically. Margins are expected to improve quarter-on-quarter, largely on the back of rupee depreciation.This is despite salary increments (in select cases),"" Kotak Securities Head of Private Client Group Research Dipen Shah said in a report.Infosys will kick-off the quarterly earnings seasons on October 11, followed by Tata Consultancy Services on October 15 and HCL Technologies on October 17. Wipro is yet to announce the date for second quarter financial results.The July-September quarter has been volatile, with the rupee depreciating about 11 per cent Q-o-Q against the dollar, on an average basis.According to analysts, while 1 per cent drop in exchange rate boosts operating margins of top exporters by over 30-35 basis points, the extent of benefit depends upon the companies' hedging policies.A report by Angel Broking said the revenue growth in rupee terms is expected to be in the range of 13.5-16.5 percent Q-o-Q for tier-I IT companies.IDBI Capital said in its results preview: ""We expect volume growth to pick up in Q2 against the backdrop of modest acceleration in US economy along with improvement in decision making cycle. We forecast 2.2-5 percent US dollar revenue growth for Top-5 IT companies in Q2.""Traditionally, Q2 is good for IT companies because of the strong budget flush that happens before close of the annual capex cycle by clients. IT companies are expected to witness budget flush from clients on discretionary, operational and capital spending.""For tier-II companies, we expect volume growth to be modest at 2.0-5.5 percent Q-o-Q...dollar revenue growth is expected to be 1.5-5 percent Q-o-Q,"" Angel Broking said.It added that with the rupee depreciating sharply against the dollar, IT companies are expected to deploy the gains towards sales and marketing, mitigation of impact of the Immigration bill and investments in new service lines.TCS is expected to lead the tier-I pack with 4.3 percent Q-o-Q dollar revenue growth, while Infosys is also likely to see a good quarter with 4.1 per cent Q-o-Q revenue growth, Kotak Institutional Equities said in its quarterly technology report."

The immediate priority has to be stabilisation in financial markets and demonstrating the ability of India to effectively deal with global challenges of Fed tapering concerns and Middle East turmoil.

The recent measures by the government and the RBI are beginning to have a positive impact on confidence.The outlook for current account deficit is positive near term, which will not only help confidence, but together with recent RBI measures on NRI deposits and fx borrowings by banks, it will also help in rupee rebound in 4Q.Beaten down financials sector will likely rally most on stabilization in currency markets, but that will also be a time to trim positions in the sector, as fundamental concerns and over-ownership remain.Kick-starting a new investment cycle will be key to long term growth revival in the economy. Private sector capex is constrained by all-time high leverage. Removing bottlenecks to ongoing / existing projects the best near term solution to getting some investment going- something the CCI has been trying to push for.Consumption has shown clear signs of slowing, and will slow further despite good monsoons.Silver lining will be plays on export gainers and likely import compression.Our recommended strategy called for a Switch from Consumer to IT Services sector a few months back, and that strategy should still be followed.Overweight on Energy, IT Services, Telecom, Pharma.

The strongest growth outlook for US demand for information and communication technology since the 2008 financial crisis is likely to help Narayana Murthy revive Infosys Ltd, the Indian IT giant he founded, but the updraft will also boost its faster-growing rivals.

India's second largest computer services exporter, once seen as a bellwether for India's USD 108 billion IT industry, derives 62 percent of revenues from North America, a larger share than competitors Tata Consultancy Services Ltd , HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd.

Technology consultancy Forrester Research forecasts an improving economy to spur US businesses and government bodies to increase information and communications technology purchases by 6.1 percent in 2014, the steepest gain since growth of 5.8 percent in 2010, which followed a contraction in demand during the global financial crisis.

Growth in 2013 is forecast at 5.7 percent.

""The demand environment is now quite solid,"" said Ganesh Natarajan, CEO of mid-sized Indian IT outsourcer Zensar Technologies . ""This is the right time for all the pent-up customer demand.""

Infosys last month returned Murthy to the helm more than a decade after he stepped down as chief executive to help reverse falling market share and end two years of disappointing results.

The Bangalore-based company, which reports its June quarter results on Friday, has struggled to reap the rewards of an initiative to generate a bigger share of its revenue from proprietary software, and has lost market share to Tata Consultancy and HCL in recent quarters.

Concerns over US visa rules

Several analysts expect Infosys to retain its April forecast of 6-10 percent revenue growth for the fiscal year that ends next March. Morgan Stanley, however, last week said Infosys may cut that forecast to 4-6 percent.

Infosys' outlook lags the 12-14 percent growth estimated for the sector in financial 2013/14 by the National Association of Software and Services Companies, an Indian industry group.

""IT services from a macro perspective is looking good. Now within the gamut of IT companies, all of them may not uniformly benefit,"" said Tarun Sisodia, a director at IT industry advisory firm Chanakya Niti Consultancy Pvt Ltd.

Looming large over all Indian IT companies is the possibility that the United States, the sector's biggest market, will implement as early as next year new visa rules that will make it more costly and difficult to send workers there.

Infosys also faces management challenges. The head of sales said on Tuesday he had left, and investors have voiced concerns that the company is too reliant on its founders for leadership.

""A people disadvantage exists today at Infosys,"" Sisodia said. ""There is a people advantage at Tata Consultancy.""

Shares in Infosys have risen 4.1 percent since Murthy returned to the company on June 1, in line with gains in the IT sector."

The weak rupee is surly working in favour of the IT companies as Q1 earnings season draws near. Gautam Sinha Roy of Motilal Oswal Securities is bullish on HCL Tech and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is his second preference in that space. He does not expect much from Infosys as of now.

He told CNBC-TV18 that United Spirits and Lupin will also be in his preference list. United Spirits does not look like it will give good returns in the coming week, but from the long term perspective he finds the stock interesting.

Below is the verbatim transcript of his interview to CNBC-TV18

Q: IT space will be the key focus next week as we start off with the Infosys earnings. In general what is your expectation from the sector itself and how would you be positioned on individual stocks? Any buy calls or any accumulate calls on individual names?

A: Within the IT space there are a couple of factors which should continue to impact performance of the space. One is the rupee depreciation that we are seeing. This should help the business models of these companies and improve profitability over a period of time.

That apart the discretionary spend growth that we are expecting in the beginning of the year doesn’t seem to be coming back as has been highlighted by Accenture again in its latest release. So, between these two diverse factors what we like is the more commoditised players like HCL Tech. There we expect earnings per share (EPS) growth to be continue to be strong. Valuations are also attractive. So, HCL Tech will be our top pick heading into the results season.

We would not expect any positive surprise from Infosys as of now because of delays in recovery in the discretionary spend environment. So, we would continue to be positive on the space, but prefer HCL Tech and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) as a second preference.

Q: Last week we saw lot of stocks that were involved with either stake buys or open offers. So, names like Firstsource was up about 30 percent, Mangalore Chemicals where we saw Deepak Fertilizers buying stake and United Spirits as well because of the Diageo news. Among these three stocks are there any names that you would accumulate right now?

A: Its just coincidental that all three events have occurred together including Hindustan Unilever (HUL) in the past week.

United Spirits is one name which has been positive for a long time. There is a lot if support from the factor that there is a ready and willing buyer who wants to acquire the company and take a majority stake there. Only 25 percent has been acquired or the stake is only 25 percent till now. So, there is a lot of room to go there. Also there is an expectation of long term restructuring and re-rating of the business per se with profitability expected to improve significantly.

So, that is one bet that I would be willing to take from a buy perspective. However one might have to be patient there, it might not necessarily give you very good results in the next week.

However, for one year holder United Spirits should give good returns.

Q: You have picked up Lupin as a stock idea for next week. That stock has been one of the biggest gainers in 2013. What was your view on how much incremental upside this stock can see and what kind of a target price you would have?

A: This stock has been one of the favorites since the beginning of the year and we continue to like it. May be from a near term perspective we should expect another 7-8 percent kind of upside, but the fact is that in a very likely choppy market we have US non-farm payroll data coming in. We don’t know how the broader market might behave next week from that perspective.

So, in a choppy market good quality defensive is something that one should always look at. Lupin fits the bill perfectly here because not only it’s a defensive pharma stock, but also is delivering good results. Management is out there guiding those results, which will continue to be good.

All their business and factors which affect the business all of them seem to be positive. So, lot of positive tailwinds for this stock. That is the main reason why we continue to like this stock at this point of time."

IT stocks today rose as much as 3 per cent in an otherwise weak stock market after sentiments turned buoyant amid the rupee sinking to an all-time low of 60.35 against the dollar, as the stronger US currency boosts the sales of software firms in rupee terms.

Brokerage house Motilal Oswal sees HCL Tech and Hindalco as the key beneficiaries of rupee depreciation, while Bharti Airtel and Maruti Suzuki are seen the key losers.Following is the brokerage’s snapshot of how the companies stand to gain/lose* For Hindalco, rupee depreciation will bolster its standalone revenues which are mainly dollar linked, while most of its operating expenditure remains stable. Accordingly, our EPS estimates for FY15 is increased by 20 percent to Rs 20/share. HCL Tech has the maximum EPS sensitivity to movements in currency. This is partly due to the higher operating leverage, resulting in 11 percent change in EPS. Maruti Suzuki and Bharti Airtel will be negatively impacted due to rupee depreciation.* Maruti Suzuki has hedged 40 percent JPY (yen)/USD exposure (including indirect and royalty) at 95-98 levels for FY14 (90-92 for 4QFY13), while for INR/USD leg is open. The recent pull back in USD/JPY (thereby impacting rates for further hedges) coupled with INR depreciation would impact Maruti Suzuki’s FY14E/15E EPS by 6.8/7.7 percent"

Infosys is going back to the future. Co-founder NR Narayana Murthy is coming out of retirement to take the helm of the Indian software outsourcing company. His return is a sign of the depth of the malaise at the former poster child of the industry.

The 66-year-old entrepreneur, who was Infosys chief executive for 19 years, is returning as executive chairman for five years. In what could be a signal of future leadership transition, Murthy's computer scientist son is coming on board as executive assistant.

Also read:

Infosys has lost its halo in the two years that Murthy has been away. Its shares fell 22 percent on April 12, when Infosys warned that revenue growth will be just six to 10 percent in the financial year that began on April 1. That makes the company a laggard in an industry expected to expand by as much as 14 percent.

Margins are under pressure: earnings before interest and taxes fell to under 26 percent of revenue in the last financial year, down from 29 percent in the previous 12 months. One culprit is pricing. Unlike rivals

HCL Technologies

and

Wipro

, Infosys is struggling to get paid more by its clients for the work it does at its offshore locations.

Making matters worse, productivity gains are falling short of the pay increases that Infosys is being forced to shell out to its 157,000 employees to keep them from jumping ship. The company's strategy of granting some of its other founders a spell as CEO has also interfered with decisive leadership.

Infosys wants to transform itself into a higher-margin technology consulting powerhouse, but has had little success so far. Acquisitions could help, but in order to have an impact they will need to be bigger than Lodestone, the Swiss business advisory firm Infosys bought in October last year for USD 349 million.

There is no resource constraint. Indeed, Infosys has too much cash. The company's war chest is Rs 23600 crores, equivalent to 17 percent of its market value. Infosys shares jumped almost nine percent on news of Murthy's return. One practical way to reward that confidence would be to return some cash to shareholders while Infosys ponders a new growth strategy.

Context news

Infosys Ltd., India's second-largest computer software exporter, announced on June 1 that NR Narayana Murthy, who co-founded the company and was its chief executive for 19 years until 2002, will return as executive chairman for a five-year term."

FY2014 may be looking a brighter growth year than FY2013 for IT firms, but hiring activity especially among freshers/trainees, doesn't seem to be in sync with it.Several top companies like Infosys Wipro and HCL Tech who gave offers to engineering students last year have deferred joining dates.A trend among IT firms was to hire en-masse from engineering colleges and then send offer letters to the selected candidates depending on the work load. But now candidates who have already been selected have had to wait for six months to a year to get their joining dates.India's top software services exporter Tata Consultancy Services recently said it is confident of beating NASSCOM's FY14 growth guidance of 12-14 percent and will hire 45,000 employees on a gross basis. But this is lower than the over 50,000 employees it had guided to hire in FY13 and 70,000 gross employees it added in FY12.According to Ambit Capital, which surveyed 30 tier-II engineering colleges, a primary scouting place for IT firms, there has been a slowdown in campus recruitments.""Our survey results confirm that campus hiring has declined significantly during the 2012-13 placement season. Some of the colleges surveyed have seen a 50-70 percent decline in the number of offers as well as a decline in the number of companies visiting their campus,"" said analysts Ankur Rudra and Nitin Jain in a recent report.Automation is certainly one reason for the decline in hiring. More and more systems and processes are now being automated and that means lesser number of software developers and testers are needed.But more importantly its the slowdown in client spending and the overall global demand uncertainties that have plagued the sector in the last couple of years, that has turned companies cautious in expanding their work force. Companies earlier used to maintain a huge bench strength (idle employees). But with the slowdown in spending and pressure on margins, organisations have become much leaner.There are also company specific issues. India's second largest software services exporter Infosys, for instance has lagged the industry growth for several quarters now. It deferred salary hikes and increments last year to October. On-site employees, in fact got their increment only in Jan this year. It had also deferred hiring last year.Infosys pushed its employee utilisation levels to around 69 percent in fourth quarter. But that is still at a low level. According to Morgan Stanley Research, the company has idle capacity of 43,000 employees.In a post earnings conference call, Infosys CEO SD Shibulal told analysts the company will honour all the offers it has already made.Some analysts also point out that since the sector has reached a scale, lot of hiring now also happens from within the IT industry, which could be one more reason for slowdown in hiring from colleges and other sectors.In a recent conference call, India's third largest IT company Wipro told analysts it has absorbed all its freshers hired from campuses last fiscal and they have gone on campus to hire for this fiscal too. Its hiring, however, will be based on demand and one-third of its hiring is now from laterals.Nachiket Kelkar"

Prabhudas Lilladher has come out with its report on Information Technology (IT) sector update. The research firm see increased competition in IS outsourcing to exert pressure to outdo their rivals in terms of costs and deliverables and see risk for the companies increasing due to possible aggressive bidding for Infrastructure Management Services (IMS) contracts.

""Infrastructure Services Outsourcing (IS, IMS, RIM, TIS) has been the key revenue growth driver for Indian IT. All the managements have highlighted that infrastructure-led deals are expected to drive the growth opportunity. We see increased competition in IS outsourcing to exert pressure to outdo their rivals in terms of costs and deliverables. We see risk for the companies increasing due to possible aggressive bidding for Infrastructure Management Services (IMS) contracts. Among peers,

HCL Tech

has the highest contribution from IMS in their portfolio as well as the highest percentage of incremental revenue contribution from the service line. We cite caution on the increasing risk of the services portfolio for the company.

Competitiveness of Global peers at an all-time low: Traditional global majors like HP, CSC, Dell and Xerox have been the traditional leaders in IMS contracts. Low operating margins (high single digit to low teens) and weak cash-flows restrict their ability to offer realization cut on the renegotiated contracts. According to TPI, ~US$100bn deals are up for grabs, largely led by IS Outsourcing. Moreover, increased credibility of Indian IT majors would help them win business critical IS Outsourcing deals.

Indian IT: Long term growth outlook intact, says Angel

IMS - key service for growth: IMS currently contributes ~16% revenue to Tier-1, with HCL Tech deriving ~27% of revenue from the services. IMS has grown at CQGR of 5.5% & 4.9% over the last four and eight quarters, respectively, for Tier- 1 Indian IT companies (8.2% & 6.6% for HCL Tech) compared to overall revenue growth of 2.3% and 3.1%, respectively, for the same period.

Is the risk increasing with heightened activity in IS Outsourcing? The new vendors, who bid for the replacement/renewal market, are under pressure to outdo their rivals in terms of costs and deliverables. The aggressive bidding could possibly increase the risk of the overall service portfolio.

Risks may not materialize immediately! Most of the Indian IT Services firm are ITIL certified to offer high quality infrastructure services to clients. We do not expect the heightened risk to materialize immediately, but higher contribution of IMS-led work could increase the portfolio risk.

Valuation & Recommendation - Continue to prefer balance portfolio: ""Faster, better, and cheaper"" PICK TWO. Some contracts’ commitment may be trying to bundle all the three, which may put pressure on the profitability of the projects in the long run or may increase risk of the portfolio. Risk to profitability and revenue definitely warrants attention. We stay cautious on HCL Tech, due to higher contribution from Infrastructure-led work. However, HCL Tech has perfected the art of delivering one of the best IMS services among peers,"" says Prabhudas Lilladher research report.

Angel Broking has come out with its report on Information Technology (IT) sector update - March 2013. The research firm expects TCS and HCL Tech to lead the growth in tier-I IT pack by growing higher than the industry average in FY2014 and recommends accumulate rating on TCS and HCL Tech with target price of Rs 1,624 and Rs 875, respectively.

The global economy is set to improve going ahead with global GDP predicted to grow by 3.5 percent in CY2013 and 4.1 percent in CY2014. Global IT - business process management (BPM) spend is expected to grow in the range of 5-6 percent over the next two years and global sourcing is set to grow faster at ~8 percent during 2013 and 2014. India continues to be the global sourcing leader, but it accounts for only ~10 percent of the total global IT-BPM spend of US$124-130bn, which implies that the market is huge and presents immense untapped opportunity. Indian IT-BPM firms are well positioned to take advantage of these trends by working towards developing new capabilities, servicing the entire IT services value chain and expanding their focus to new geographies, technologies and industry verticals. Indian companies grabbing market share vs global peers: We expect worldwide IT spending (excluding hardware) to post a three-year CAGR of 4.4 percent while the total sourcing market is expected to grow by ~7-8 percent (~2x of worldwide spend).

Top IT service players globally have been increasing their market share every year in the overall IT-BPM spending and have gained ~110bp per annum share annually since the last five years. While the worldwide IT services market has posted a five year CAGR of just ~3.5 percent and global sourcing market having posted a CAGR of ~9 percent commensurately, Indian software services revenue has posted a 16 percent CAGR (almost 2x of growth in global sourcing); primary reason for the same being the labor arbitrage or cost savings to clients. The top-5 Indian IT companies have been increasingly gaining market share since last five years in the overall revenues from biggies of IT services sector globally.

Indian IT - Large cap companies leading the growth: The top-5 Indian IT services vendors have increased their share of Indian IT exports by ~135bp per annum. This supplements the fact that Indian large-cap players have been surpassing mid-cap companies in terms of grabbing market share. Taking into notice the average market share gains over the past six years (FY2007-12) and 7-8 percent CAGR in global sourcing spend for the next three years, the top-5 Indian IT companies are likely to grow at ~14 percent CAGR over the next three years.

Valuation: We continue to remain positive on TCS and HCL Tech from a longer term perspective, though current valuations preclude us from taking any considerable upsides from current levels for the next couple of quarters. We expect TCS and HCL Tech to lead the growth in tier-I IT pack by growing higher than the industry average in FY2014. We recommend Accumulate rating on TCS and HCL Tech with target price of Rs 1,624 and Rs 875, respectively. The PE premium commanded by TCS over Infosys has reduced now, given Infosys' outperformance during 3QFY2013 after six quarters of disappointing results. We maintain Accumulate rating on Infosys as well as Wipro with target price of Rs 3,132 and Rs 473, respectively.

Tech Mahindra

remains one of our preferred picks in the entire IT space as the company has recently acquired two companies which will give it inorganic boost. Also, post its merger with Mahindra Satyam, the risks which the company is facing right now such as client concentration and industry concentration will be curtailed and the company will be able to reap benefits from

Mahindra Satyam

's capability in enterprise services. Along with Tech Mahindra, we like

KPIT Cummins

among mid-caps at the current level with a target price of Rs 130, owing to recent correction in the stock price despite industry leading revenue growth,"" says Angel Broking research report.

Prabhudas Lilladher has come out with its report on IT sector. The research firm continues to retain their preference for Wipro and Infosys as the expectation and valuations leave room for positive surprise.



The performance of Q3FY13 (OND-12) was bunched-up in terms of volume growth (excluding Wipro) for Tier-1 (Top-4) Indian IT vendors, with strong-beat-to expectation by Infosys, touch ahead for HCL Tech and TCS, whereas in-line performance by Wipro. The growth from Europe was a sigh of relief; however, commentary was more optimistic for the US. The demand environment has shown recovery, but we expect steady rather than sharp recovery. We continue to retain our preference for Wipro and Infosys as the expectation and valuations leave room for positive surprise.



Positive surprise- Infosys, Beat- TCS and HCL Tech, In-Line - Wipro: Volume growth (excluding Wipro) in Q3FY13 has been more bunched-up; however, different level of productivity gain has resulted in various degrees of outperformance and underperformance. Volume surprise was in the range of 2% to 1%, whereas operating margin performance has been divergent with positive surprise from all. The productivity gain offset weak volume momentum. Infosys delivered the strongest growth of 6.3% QoQ (Organic Volume: 1.5%; Pricing: 1.8%; @CC: 3.3%) followed by TCS of 3.3% QoQ (V: 1.25% P: 1.3% @CC: 2.64%), HCLT of 1% QoQ (V: 0.4%; P: 0.5% @CC: 1%), and Wipro of 2.4% QoQ (V: -1% P: 3.8% @CC: 2.8%). Q3FY13 was a trend reversal (3.6% QoQ in USD term, ΔRevenue: $286m) after hitting trough in Q2FY13. We see the deal pipeline improving, but the recovery needs to be sustained for better CY13.



Infosys performance . Defying consensus: Infosys performance has exceeded expectation on all counts including organic revenue growth and margin. The management commentary was incrementally positive. We now expect steady improvement in Infosys performance.



Growth from Europe a positive surprise, Commentary more optimistic for NA: Growth across Tier-1 and technology majors has been strong from Europe. According to the managements, the stronger growth was largely due to underpenetration that has led to acquisition of few first-time outsourcers/offshorers and smaller base. However, the management remained more positive about growth from North America.



Despite caution and furloughs, BFSI and manufacturing strong: The commentary of managements indicated more run-the-bank, few transform-thebank and regulatory related work. Moreover, the management indicates scope of pent-up demand unleashing in BFSI. We expect FY14 growth to get stronger.

"February 13, 2013 04:45 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/-1385627.html,"A revenue deficit happens when the net amount received (that is revenues less expenditures) falls short of the projected net amount to be received. This occurs when the actual amount of revenue received and/or the actual amount of expenditures do not correspond with predicted revenue and expenditure figures. This is the opposite of a revenue surplus, which occurs when the actual amount exceeds the projected amount.

For example, consider an organization with budgeted revenue of USD 325,000 and budgeted expenditures of USD 200,000, which equates to a net amount of USD 125,000. During the fiscal year, the organization's total revenue is actually USD 300,000, while its total expenditure is USD 195,000. The net amount received by the organization is USD 105,000, which is USD 20,000 less than the projected receipt of USD 125,000.Therefore, although the organization generated a positive net amount of proceeds, it fell short of the projected amount, creating a revenue deficit."

Infosys can test Rs 2550-2600, says Anil Manghnani, Modern Shares & Stock Brokers.

Manghnani told CNBC-TV18, ""Infosys has been pretty subdued for the last two-three months. It has not participated at all in the rally. The first level I am looking at is about Rs 2,475. It is a falling trendline. If it can take that out then it opens up upside of Rs 2,550-2,600. So watch for Rs 2,475 especially being a weekly close also.""He further added, ""I think the other ones could benefit also. If you look at HCL Tech , if it is suggesting to open around Rs 650 or so, it is only Rs 10 from its recent highs. So while the CNX-IT may have underperformed, HCL Tech is doing pretty well, TCS which has been also very subdued after hitting Rs 1,400 plus could benefit from these numbers. So overall effect it might help some of the other stocks also. It is not just going to be Infosys this morning."""

Angel Broking has come out with its earnings estimates on IT sector for December quarter FY13. The research firm expect volume growth to be in the range of 2-3% qoq for tier-I IT companies, with TCS leading the pack. Pricing is expected to remain stable. For tier-II companies, we expect growth to be modest at 1.0-8.0% qoq, with Tech.

Angel Broking Q3 earnings estimates for IT sector:

Mixed economic data indicates flat CY2013 IT budgets

The Indian IT services industry is likely to touch ~USD 98 billion in FY2013 according to Nasscom, close to 6x of where it was in FY2004, a CAGR of 13% over the past five years. Gartner's current US dollar growth forecast for the overall global IT spending in 2012 has been revised up slightly from 2.5% last quarter to 3.0% now but in constant US dollar terms, the forecast growth for overall IT spending in 2012 is unchanged at 5.2%. While the challenges facing global economic growth persist - the eurozone crisis, weaker US recovery and a slowdown in China - the outlook has at least stabilized. Also, according to IDC, a market research firm, the global IT spending is expected to grow by 6% in 2012 in constant currency, slightly down on last year's pace of 7% growth.

Our take: Given the current uncertain environment, we expect volume growth of tier-I Indian IT companies to scale down to sub-12% in FY2013. The BFSI industry, from which IT companies derive maximum revenue, is expected to be a laggard in terms of growth. A weak performance from these accounts due to weaker-than-anticipated acceleration implies industry-wide slowdown in IT spending. The IT spend now is driven by trends such as increased offshoring of work from Europe and vendor consolidation. Market share gains in the renewal deal pipeline will be a key differentiator of volume growth across players in our view. Management commentary within the sector provide a mixed outlook for 2013 IT budgets as of now. Early comments from managements indicate that IT budgets will remain flattish in CY2013.

Cyclically a weak quarter with decent volume growth

Traditionally, 3Q is a weak quarter for IT companies as the number of working days is less compared to other quarters, due to the holiday season at the client sites. We expect 3QFY2013 volume growth to be impacted slightly because of Hurricane Sandy in the US and furloughs seen in the banking and financial services space.

For 3QFY2013, we expect volume growth to be in the range of 2-3% qoq for tier-I IT companies, with TCS leading the pack. Pricing is expected to remain stable. For tier-II companies, we expect growth to be modest at 1.0-8.0% qoq, with Tech.

The Indian IT sector is expected to perform better in FY14 on an estimated forecast growth of 12 percent in USD revenue, according to a report by Goldman Sachs.Highlighting the findings of the 67th edition of Goldman Sachs' global IT spending survey, analysts Rishi Jhunjhunwala and Girish Ramkumar explain that the growth in the India IT sector will be buttressed by an estimated 3 percent growth in global IT spending growth as compared to 2 percent in 2012 and reduced impact of the fiscal cliff allowing IT budgets to expand during the course of 2013.However, the analysts add that results for the third quarter of FY13 may be seasonally weak with growth in USD revenue at 2.7 percent quarter-on-quarter, due to impact from seasonal shutdowns in manufacturing, BFSI and one-off disruption from Hurricane Sandy.The analysts have assigned a 'buy' rating to HCL Tech , citing growth prospects and attractive valuations. ""The company seems an attractive bet driven by and 18 percent compounded growth in EPS over FY12-FY15E on strong revenue visibility from deals worth USD2.5 billion in FY12. HCL is currently trading at 11.6 times of the expected price-earning for FY14 and selling at a 17 percent discount as compared to its large-cap peers,"" the report said.The report also expects TCS to lead the IT sector with a 3 percent q-o-q growth in USD revenues and Infosys to cut guidance on organic USD growth in FY13 to over 4 percent from over 5 percent.HCL Technologies closed at Rs 633.85 (up 1.35 percent), Infosys closed at Rs 2,348.30 (up 0.51 percent) and TCS closed at Rs 1,297.50 (up 1.50 percent) at the end of trade on Friday, January 4, on the Bombay Stock Exchange."

Shares of IT-services major Wipro crawled higher for the third day in a row amid talk in the market that the company has initiated steps to hive off its consumer care and lighting business unit. For the financial year ended March 2012, Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting accounted for 9% (Rs 3340 crore) of the total revenue and 6% (Rs 907 crore) of operating income. Wipro closed at Rs 350.80 on Wednesday, up 1% over its previous close, after hitting a high of Rs 355.20 intra-day.“We don’t comment on market speculation,” said the company’s spokesperson in response to an e-mail query on whether the company was considering such a proposal.The business unit makes toilet soaps, diapers, lights and owns international brands Yardley and Unza.In the past, the Wipro management repeatedly rebuffed suggestions from investors and bankers that the company hive-off this division so that the core business of IT services would fetch a higher valuation. Currently, Wipro shares are trading at roughly 13-14 times current year earnings, compared to around 16 times for Infosys and around 18 times for TCS. The low multiple for Wipro has largely to do with the tepid earnings growth over the past few quarters.Wipro, along with Infosys, has been a laggard among frontline IT services shares so far this calendar. Wipro is down around 12% year-till-date, compared to a 1% decline in the CNX IT Index. During the same period, TCS has risen 13%, HCL Tech 56% and Tech Mahindra 63%. Among sector heavyweights, only Infosys (down 14%) fared worse than Wipro.Despite a not-so-rosy outlook for the IT sector, market participants feel the weakness in Infosys and Wipro shares have largely to do with company specific issues.In mid-March this year, Azim Premji Trust--part of the promoter group--got a poor response when it tried to sell shares to institutional investors through the offer for sale (OFS) route. Of the 3.5 crore shares that were auctioned, only about 1.75 crore shares found takers. The Trust raised Rs 738 crore at an average price of Rs 421 crore, about half of what it had hoped to garner. Many bids were rejected as they had come in below the floor price of Rs 418. At Monday’s closing price, the stock is down roughly 16% from the time of the auction.As on September 30, 2012, promoters own 78.31% in the company. They have to sell another 3.31% bring it down to 75% by August 2013 to comply with the Sebi rule on minimum 25% public shareholding.Analysts tracking the stock say the poor performance of the stock since the last share placement will make it tough for bankers to ask for premium valuations from fund managers for the next round of sale. So it makes sense for the management to separate the IT services and consumer businesses, which would help it command a better valuation for the software business. santosh.nair@network18online.com"

Aditya Birla Money is bullish on HCL Tech and has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 689 in its October 18, 2012 research report.

Shares held by Central Governments/State Governments

“HCL Tech continued to clock healthy topline growth of 3.1% QoQ to 1113.8 mn from 1079.6 mn and a 11.1% YoY from 1002.3 mn. In rupee terms, it registered a growth of 2.9% QoQ to ` 60.91 bn from ` 59.19 bn. The company has witnessed decent volume growth (2.5%) for software services. On service basis, Run The Business (RTB) such as Infrastructure Management services (IMS) & BPO led the growth by 10.4% & 5.5% respectively, whereas Change The Business (CTB) such as Enterprise Application Services (EAS) & Engg & R&D services (ERD) remained under pressure (-1.3% & 0.4% respectively). In terms of verticals, emerging verticals (Life sciences 14.6% & Retail 10.3%) led the growth, whereas Telecom remained soft (-3.3%). On geographical mix, US (3.9%) and Europe (2.8%) led the show (QoQ $ terms).”“We believe that, HCL would extract more out of the current unfavourable and somewhat similar environment, with its proven strategy placing itself once again in the sweet spot. HCL Tech continued to remain in Top 5 players in TPI index across all regions and segments especially in RTB segments like BPO and ITO Till the macro environment improves CTB deals would likely to remain choppy whereas RTB side is expected to see more restructuring contracts upcoming for renewals in the next 6 to 18 months. We believe HCL Tech is major contender in ITO deals and directly competes with Global MNC’s like Accenture, CGI, HP & IBM.”“The results were in-line with estimates on revenue terms and surprised on margin and PAT front. Management continued to sound optimism on the company outlook based upon the strong order wins and execution. We revise our earnings upwards by 4.1% and 5.9% for FY13E and FY14E to factor in the better than expected execution. Currently HCL trades at a consolidated P/E of 12 2x and 10 6x on its FY13E and FY14E earnings of Rs47 5 and Rs 54 7 respectively We reiterate ourpositive view on HCL based upon a) industry leading growth (CAGR of 24% FY09-12), b) strong revenue visibility ($2.5 bn worth deal) & upcoming restructuring deals in 6 to 18 months, c) stable operating margin (improved from 16.3% in Q1FY11 to 22.2% in Q1FY13, which was key concern for the investors) and d) healthy free cash flow position. These above mentioned factors would help HCL Tech to trade close to some of its larger peers in the medium term. We continue to value HCL at 12x on its one-year forward earnings with revised target price of Rs689.2 and reiterate our buy rating,” says Aditya Birla Money research report.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Dolat Capital is bullish on HCL Tech and has recommended accumulate rating on the stock with a target of Rs 655 in its October 17, 2012 research report.

“HCL Tech, we believe the strong volume growth of about 4.5% QoQ and 12 multi million USD deals won during the quarter indicates sustained business traction. Also maintenance of OPM at 19.4% despite wage hikes impact of 80bps during the quarter indicates improved efficiency and productivity gains. The company has been delivering strong revenue growth compared to its peers with improved profitability profile and sustenance on the same remains potential upside risk to the estimate. We maintain our positive stance on the stock with a target price of Rs 655 (valued at 12x of FY14E earnings).”“Management continues to remain confident on business outlook in coming period and expects better H2 versus H1 citing TPI’s expectation of 100% jump in deal renewals in H2 over H1. It has won its fair share in these renewal deals over last few quarter and 80% of these new deals wins were from the G2000 clients. The management believes that it has benefitted as it shifted back its focus with full energy back to the developed markets (US, Euro) as it witnessed more number of RTB deals due for renewal and defocused ROW for the moment. It is also witnessing strong traction in the BFSI segment (contrary to peers) largely driven by vendor consolidation efforts.”“We expect the company to maintain strong financial outperformance with a Revenue/ EPS CAGR of 16/23% over FY12-14E (FY14 EPS revised up by 9%), driven by sustained deal win momentum and renewed focus on margin maintenance. We maintain our positive view on the stock based with an Accumulate rating with a target price of Rs 655 (valued at 12x of its FY14E – 20% discount to Infosys target multiple),” says Dolat Capital research report.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

SPA Research is bullish on HCL Tech and has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 650 in its October 18, 2012 research report.

“HCL Technologies reported a strong Q1FY13 revenue growth at 3.2% at $ 1,114mn (SPAe: $ 1,116mn) on the back of 4.5% increase in volume and 0.7% pricing growth in S/w services. Operating margins also improved by 20bps to 22.2% exercising various margin levers, offsetting wage hikes undertaken in this quarter. The company won 12 multimillion, multiyear deals in Q1FY13 across manufacturing, BFSI and Consumer services. We expect HCL to be able to repeat its feat of winning large restructured deals in Q2FY13 as it did in Q2FY12. Thus, we continue to recommend BUY with an 18-month TP of INR 650.”“HCL Tech Q1FY13 revenue grew at 3.2% to $1,114mn on the back of 4.5% volume growth. Pricing in software services also grew by 0.7% (Offshore 0.5%, Onsite -0.8%). Infrastructure services (10.7%) and BPO (5.5%) showed significant growth. The company recorded a 51% deal win ratio winning 12 major deals in Q1FY13 across various verticals. In Q1 revenues from US grew by 3.9%, Europe by 2.8% with flat RoW. In IT services Healthcare registered a strong Q1 growth of 14.7% followed by Retail (10.4%), Media (7.8%) and BFSI (4.5%). Telecom (-3.3%) and E&Y (-1.1%) degrew.”“With strong deal pipeline we expect the company to register a 14.3% USD revenue growth in FY13 and 19% CAGR over FY12-14E on the back of even stronger rebid offers coming in FY14. On the margin front we expect some retraction to 18.7%/18.2% in FY13E/14E due to (i) Currency headwinds (ii) Sales Investments and (iii) Higher just-in-time lateral additions to cater to rebid contracts. Factoring in all this we estimate a 16.7% EPS CAGR over FY12-14E. We continue to recommend BUY on the stock with an 18-month TP of INR 650 at 13x FY14E earnings,” says SPA Research report.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Emkay Global Financial Services is bullish on HCL Tech and has recommended accumulate rating on the stock with a target of Rs 650 in its October 17, 2012 research report.

“HCLT reported inline rev at US$ 1,113 mn (+3.2% QoQ) with growth led by strong show from IMS (+10% QoQ 80%+ of incremental rev during the qtr) with IT Services rev growth tad soft at ~0.5% QoQ (IT Services vol growth at 2.5%). However the big surprise came from ~20 bps improvement in EBITDA margins at 21.8% (V/s our est of ~100 bps sequential decline) despite wage increments (-80 bps impact) aided by offshore shift (offshore % of rev increased by ~160 bps QoQ to 44.3% and is the highest since Dec’08 levels) and increase in utilization (74.2%, up 180 bps sequentially). Profits at Rs 8,631 mn (+2.6% QoQ) came in higher driven by op performance beat. Amongst verticals, Healthcare and Retail grew by 14%/10% QoQ with Fin Svcs growing by ~4.4% QoQ. Improvement in client metrics continued with no of US$ 20mn/30mn+ clients increasing by 4 to 49/29 respectively.”“HCL Tech’s strong performance through the past few qtrs (and most importantly through H1FY13) should put to rest a ‘either revenue growth or margins’ thesis that has kept a large section of investors away from owning HCLT. Mgmt noted that it remains confident of sustaining revenue growth within the Top Tier league along with maintaining/improving margins (ex currency) through operational levers like utilization, higher offshore % of revenues and growth leverage. In this context we highlight that HCL Tech has shown commendable improvement in client metrics through recent quarters which lend confidence to our thesis on ‘margin upsides’ for the company. Co noted that it would be refocusing a lot of sales effort in chasing the rebid opportunity (US$ 61 bn worth of deals up for rebid in H2CY12) with it’s recent win ratios of ~50% driving confidence on sustaining rev growth momentum ahead.”“We raise our FY13/14E EPS by ~8%/4% each to Rs 47.3/49 respectively driven largely by higher margin assumptions to 20.1%/18.9% (V/s 18.8%/18.5% earlier). While sector wide slowdown continues to drive revenue growth trajectory down for HCLT as well, we see HCLT on a stronger footing driven by strong order book and scope to improve margins through improved client mining with recent quarters lending enough confidence to the thesis.

Motilal Oswal is bullish on HCL Tech and has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 676 in its October 17, 2012 research report.

“HCL Tech's (HCLT) 4.5% QoQ volume growth, sustained operating margin and 12 large deal wins were the key positives in 1QFY13. Revenue growth in constant currency was 2.9% QoQ and dollar revenue at USD1,114m grew 3.2%, only marginally below our estimate of USD1,119m. Growth drivers for 1QFY13 include IMS (+10.3% QoQ), Healthcare (14.9% QoQ), Retail (10.9% QoQ), Media (7.4% QoQ) and BFSI (4.1% QoQ).”“Sustained margins (21.8% EBITDA, +20bp QoQ v/s est. of -230bp) in a quarter of wage hike were aided by: [1] lower impact from wage hikes (80bp v/s est. of 200bp), [2] lower SGA at 13% v/s est. of 13.9%, [3] revenue mix shift in favor of offshore (150bp QoQ) and [4] utilization including trainees, at 74.2% v/s est. of 73%. PAT (after ESOP charges) was INR8.72b and significantly beats our estimate of INR7.93b, despite forex losses of INR609m (v/s est. of INR222m), due to greater profitability and lower tax rate (23.1% v/s est. of 24%). Notwithstanding near term headwinds, there is still scope for HCL to expand margins through levers of: [1] utilization, where internal targets remain higher than current levels, [2] employee pyramid, [3] greater offshoring as deals in RTB space mature and [4] BPO, where profitability is expected to grow to overall company average in couple of years.”“Our revenue estimates are largely unchanged. However, we have raised FY13/FY14 earnings estimates by 5.7%/6.9% due to an upgrade in EBIT margin estimates by 113bp/60bp. We maintain that rare visibility on volume growth in an uncertain environment and continued impressive execution, reflected in strong margins, would warrant a higher multiple. Our EBIT margin estimate of 15.5% in FY14 conservatively builds a 220bp YoY decline, thus providing reasonable comfort to our earnings estimate. Maintain Buy,” says Motilal Oswal research report.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

BP Equities has come out with its report on IT sector. The researnch firm has assumed US$/INR rate Rs 53.4 and Rs 52 for FY13E and FY14E. Have given buy rating on Mahindra Satyam , Polaris , Persistent and Infinite Computers whereas given a hold rating for TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech, Wipro.

Weaker dollar to restrict top line in rupee terms while dollar revenue to grow moderately:

We expect the Sep quarter (traditionally one of the best) performance to be a moderate one, specifically on the volumes growth and dollar revenue growth front, however muted discretionary spending, weak demand environment and slowdown in deal flow remains top concerns for Tier-1 IT companies. We expect volumes growth for Top four IT companies to be in the range of 2-4% in Q2 FY13. Currency movement stood volatile with rupee appreciating sharply at the end of quarter however for the full quarter average stood at Rs 53.5 (appreciation of 1.0% q-o-q). Moreover, cross currency impact will be not be so significant in the quarter (only ~ 30-50 bps impact on dollar revenues growth) as USD depreciated 3.1% against Australian dollar (AUD) while appreciated 2.7% against Euro. On the pricing front we expect it to be under pressure and have taken 0.5-1% q-o-q dip in pricing. Taking all these factors into account we expect dollar revenue growth to be in the range of 2-4% for the quarter. We expect Infosys to post 3.6% q-o-q growth in US$ terms, and 6.3% in FY13E slightly ahead of its guidance (5% growth for FY13E) while Wipro to report 1.4% q-o-q revenues growth which is higher than its US$ guidance (-1.0%/0.7% q-o-q growth). However, sharp rupee appreciation of 1.0% against the dollar will impact top line, which we expect to come in the range of 1-3% q-o-q.

Rupee appreciation and salary hikes to impact margins for IT exporters:

We expect all IT companies under our coverage to report flat to negative contraction in margins due to rupee appreciation against US$, wage hikes and high visa cost. We expect Infosys margins to expand 28 bps to 29.4% primarily due to fresher's addition, no salary hikes and increase in utilization rates. TCS is expected to report 17 bps dip in margins as gains from productivity will be offset by rise in salary, fresher's addition and rupee appreciation. We expect

margins to contract 174 bps, 143 bps and 112 bps primarily due to wage hikes and rupee appreciation. Tech Mahindra’s margins is expected to contract 264 bps primarily due to acquisition of lower margin Hutch BPO business, one time impact from cost of acquisitions and salary hikes.

Infosys likely to increase its US$ guidance however can lower rupee guidance for FY13E:

We expect Infosys to increase its US$ revenue guidance for FY13E (earlier 5% y-o-y) by 1% to 6% yo- y growth on account of recent acquisition and improvement in business environment for H2FY13. We believe,

Infosys

performance can revive in H2 FY13 on account of delayed ramp ups and could surprise the street on volumes front most probably in the next quarter.

Valuation & Outlook:

Global uncertainties, ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe and slowdown in BFSI vertical has limited further client mining opportunities within the existing top clients for Tier-1 IT companies thus limiting growth opportunities. Going forward we expect Tier-1 IT companies growth to slow down primarily due to high base effect and maturing outsourcers. Rupee appreciation remains a major concern, which can impact margins significantly. Within the large caps we expect

TCS

and HCL to lead the growth rate (mid teens) however currency volatility and expensive valuations limits significant upside. Select Mid caps IT companies have been able to grow faster than large IT companies primarily because of two factors 1) reduction of average deal size in the industry (TCV deals in range of US$25- 99 mn has increased significantly) and 2) Focus on a specialized domain or areas of competence. Thus we are more bullish on selected Mid cap-small cap IT space. We have assumed US$/INR rate Rs 53.4 and Rs 52 for FY13E and FY14E. We give buy rating on Mahindra Satyam, Polaris, Persistent and Infinite Computers whereas give a hold rating for TCS,

Infosys

,

HCL Tech

,

Wipro

.

Angel Broking has come with its September ‘12 quarterly earning estimates for IT sector. According to the research firm expects 2QFY2013 to be better than 1QFY2013. However this year's (FY2013) 2Q is not expected to be as good as 2Q tends to be traditionally due to unstable macros and economic uncertainty across the developed economies. On account of this, clients are delaying their incremental budget flush. For 2QFY2013, we expect volume growth to be in the range of 2.0-4.0% qoq for tier-I IT companies, with TCS leading the pack.

We expect TCS and HCL Tech to lead the growth in the tier-I IT pack. TCS and HCL Tech's stock prices have run up significantly and are currently trading at 17.5x and 12.8x their respective FY2014E EPS, which leaves little room for upside in the stock prices. Hence, we recommend an Accumulate rating on TCS and HCL Tech. The PE premium between TCS and Infosys has widened a lot as Infosys is expected to post a much lower growth than TCS, and is trading at 14.6x FY2014E EPS. So we recommend an Accumulate rating on Infosys as well. In addition, we have a Buy rating on Wipro with a target price of Rs 421. In the mid-cap space, we like Tech Mahindra, MindTree and KPIT Cummins."

Background: In light of the recently announced 1QFY13 results, this article compares the quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) revenue drivers of the Big 4 Indian IT companies, with a view to understand which of these drivers were sector specific versus company specific. The Big 4 are, of course, HCL Tech , Infosys , TCS and Wipro .

Revenue and its key components: Across the IT services sector, revenue growth can be attributed to the following factors/drivers:

1. Volume (person hours worked),

2. Realization/Pricing (the billing rate charged to customers),

3. Utilization (the ratio of the total billable employees who actually worked on projects to the total number of employees available to work on projects for a particular period),

4. Currency (the translation gain/loss that occurs while converting the revenue from the respective local currency to Indian rupee). The table below summarizes the results of the Big 4 based on the above parameters.

Table1: 1QFY13, Q-o-Q growth of key parameters

Q-o-Q growth of key parameters HCL Tech Infosys TCS Wipro Volume 4.60% 2.70% 5.30% 0.80% Realization/Pricing 2.70% -2.90% -1.20% -0.50% Utilization -2.80% -1.40% 0.70% 1.80% Rupee against US $ -10.00% -10.00% -10.00% -10.00%

Note: For HCL we used 4QFY12 as its last financial year ended in June, 2012.

With reference to the table above, we note the following:

Volume: While HCL Tech and TCS reported Q-o-Q volume growth to the tune of 4.6% and 5.3% respectively, Infosys's volume growth was sub-par at 2.7%. And, Wipro's woes continued with a volume growth of only 0.8%. For Wipro, 1QFY13 was in fact the third consecutive quarter in which it continued to underperform its peers with respect to volume growth.

Realization/Pricing: The Q-o-Q pricing decline for Infosys was more pronounced at nearly 3%, while TCS and Wipro saw price declines of roughly 1% and 0.5% respectively. Interestingly, during the same period, HCL Tech saw a price increase of roughly 3%.

Note: The Q-o-Q constant currency growth figures of each of the Big 4 IT companies and their respective figures for volume growth were used to calculate the effect on pricing.

Utilization: Q-o-Q analysis reveals that utilization for Infosys and HCL declined 1.4% and 2.8% respectively. At the same time, utilization for TCS and Wipro registered increases of 0.7% and 1.8% respectively. These figures do not consider the deployment of trainees.

Currency: The rupee depreciated by approximately 10% against the US dollar during the last quarter. The impact of this was uniformly felt across the Indian IT sector, including HCL Tech, Infosys, TCS and Wipro.

Conclusions: Sector or Company Specific drivers?

Volume: Our assessment indicates that volume growth has been non-uniform across the Big 4, and so it is more of a company specific rather than a sector-wide factor.

Pricing: We believe that pricing decline has impacted the entire sector. In an earlier article we pointed out why pricing can affect the industry as a whole, and that Infosys may be setting the stage for a price competition. We hold that view even though HCL Tech has seen a price increase, while the other three companies have experienced price declines as expected.

Utilization: This too seems to be company rather than sector specific with each of the Big 4 IT companies performing differently in terms of efficiency. While the relatively higher volume growth for HCL at a lower utilization is commendable, the sequential increase in volume and utilization for TCS appears to be on expected lines. Wipro seems to be doing its best to improve on the efficiency front, as its volume growth has been dwindling. And, Infosys's utilization seems to have fallen behind.

Given the current challenging and competitive environment, we believe that the Big 4 IT companies will focus on volume growth, while compromising on the pricing front."

In an interview to CNBC-TV18 Nischal Maheshwari of Edelweiss Securities speaks about his preffered stocks from the auto and IT sector post June quarter earnings.

From the auto space, he is betting on Mahindra & Mahindra and Bajaj Auto. ""

Mahindra & Mahindra

’s UV segment has grown very, very strongly. The tractor and the farm equipment side of the business have been under pressure, but the valuation is supporting it,"" he explained.

He expects

Bajaj Auto

to continue good performance because 45-50% of its sales come from exports.

He likes

Infosys

and

HCL Tech

from the IT pack. He finds valuation of Infosys attractive at current levels and sees lots of the negatives already priced in. “At these prices one should start accumulating Infosys,” he added.

Below is the edited transcript of Maheshwari’s interview with CNBC-TV18

Q: IIP figures pretty dismal at contraction of minus 1.8%. How exactly have you read it and how would you extrapolate it onto the markets and the reaction that we have seen?

A: The expectation was close to around minus 0.2% and it’s come at minus 1.8%. Capital goods continue to be very, very bad and there is nothing happening on the capex side. The growth in order books for most of the companies is very small and that all is reflecting into the capital goods growth. The only positive side remains to be that the consumer durable figure is pretty good.

Q: Perhaps one key takeaway from the IIP number has been that this is also a washout quarter. If one was looking for a bottoming out, that bottoming out is not happening. We are still bottom or so it seems. How does this impacts your earnings forecast? At the moment do you think that with more and more people coming in with GDP downgrades we are going to be seeing more corporate earnings downgrades?

A: Very interestingly this has been our theory. I have studied the last three downturns in the country where it was 91-92, then 2001-02 and again 2008-09 in all the three times you see that once the corporates come to a conclusion saying that the growth is now not going to there they stop chasing the top-line, they start focusing very, very strongly onto the bottom-line and that’s what we have seen in the current quarter also.

The top-line has been around 15-16% growth, but the bottom-line has been pretty steady at around 14%. That is what really works. Quarter after quarter you are going to see people are cutting their employee costs, SG&A expenses. This time around depreciation has been one of the big savings because people have not invested in capex. So, we are not seeing a serious downgrade as far as earnings are concerned for FY13.

Q: What is the key takeaway in that case from the earnings season so far? Let’s start with some of the high profile sectors, for instance automobiles. Do you have any buys in the space after you have seen the numbers? Tata Motors is still awaited today.

A: Mahindra and Mahindra came out with numbers yesterday. Their numbers have been pretty good. The stock has been okay given that their UV segment has grown very, very strongly. Definitely the tractor and the farm equipment side of the business has been under pressure, but the valuation is supporting it.

The stock is around 9-10 times. That’s a good stock to look at. On the two wheeler side, Bajaj Auto continues to do pretty well because around 45-50% of its sales is coming from exports. So, these are the two stocks which we like in the sector.

Q: Just wanted to concentrate on Bharti. Were you or your analyst on the conference call? That’s when the stock actually fell off post the conference call and there were these EPS downgrades which have been quite significant today. What did you make of it and is it a good time to actually bottom fish?

A: I was there on the conference call and what most of the people have misread or rather market is expecting that Bharti is still going to focus on the top-line. They are going to be focusing on more market share. What the management was trying to say that they are trying to figure out ways, basically not to destroy value, but continue to maintain their market share.

They were saying that they are looking at couple of ways to reduce cost in-house so as to bolster the margins. That is what the impression the management gave, but given that this has been the 8th or 9th quarter where the margins have been under pressure, market was waiting for a push and the stock fell.

Having said that, there are short-term concerns as far as Bharti is concerned, obviously the major being the regulatory outlook. But what people are not really looking at is the long-term cash flows for the company are pretty strong. According to our calculations, Bharti will be generating close to around USD 5-6 billion of cash in the next three years. That’s a pretty strong story.

Q: What have you done with the IT company basket? Is there any kind of a defensive play here at all? They seem to be now behaving like cyclicals.

A: We continue to like Infosys and HCL Tech. Infosys valuation-wise looks pretty good at these prices. A lot of the negatives are priced in as the management plays out its strategy. At these prices one should start accumulating Infosys. The second stock we like in the large cap is HCL Tech. They have been continuously surprising on the margins.

Historically, HCL Tech has given guidance and not been able to achieve it. But for the last three-four quarters they have been able to not only achieve that, but better the margins and market is rewarding them for that.

Another stock which we like is Satyam. Even after their merger with Tech Mahindra the stock is still cheap. It should be around 8 or 9 times. So one should look at it given the fact that together it’s going to be a formidable company of around USD 2.5 billion size."

Way2Wealth has come out with its report on HCL Tech result estimates.

Technologies’ topline in Q4FY12 is expected to register 1.81% sequential growth to reach $1067mn. Software services segment is expected to grow by 1.71% sequentially and Infrastructure services segment is expected to register sequential growth of 3.00% mainly backed by ramp up of past won deals. We believe, BPO segment would register flat performance QoQ.The company is not expected to face any margin pressure in Q4FY12 as the wage hike is scheduled to happen in next quarter. Moreover, any pressure from incremental visa cost and onsite hiring would be taken care off by INR depreciation. Moreover, better performance in the BPO business would also help margin to remain high.HCL Has $2.5bn of order-book position and ramp up of those earlier won deals would help the company to register better performance as compared to the other big peers. The company also has $1bn of deal wins in the BFSI sector and they are not experiencing much pressure of IMS spending by the global banks. Although, there are some pressure on the IT spending by the banks in USA, but, HCL has only 25% exposure to US banking space and hence not experiencing much of pressure.HCL announced very strong deal wins during the quarter mainly in total IT outsourcing and BPO space. The company’s immense focus on the combined Application and Infrastructure deals yielded results. During forth quarter, HCL won IMS contract from Norway-based Statoil and combined IT outsourcing contract from US insurance group GAIG. Some of the other important deals are; five-year IT infrastructure outsourcing deal worth $300 million with Finland based UPM, and multi-year outsourcing contract with UBS.During the quarter, the company has also concentrated to expand its presence in the growing economies and reduce exposure from the shrinking geographies. Recently HCL closed down their call centre in the Northern Ireland. But, at the same time the company opened new BPO facility in Philippines which will initially employ 1,000 people.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Nirmal Bang has come out with its report on IT sector. According to the research firm, Infosys is expected to downgrade FY13 dollar revenue guidance to 6.8-8.8%, lower currency rates to lead to rupee EPS guidance in excess of Rs175, in its report dated June 29, 2012.

Subdued dollar revenue likely due to difficult environment, cross-currency movements: We expect the companies in our IT universe to post low single-digit sequential revenue growth in US dollar (USD) terms (-0.2-2.4%) in 1QFY13, as the global economic environment remains challenging and key verticals like banking and financial services witness slower growth. We expect volume growth of 0-3% QoQ, with billing rates likely to register a 1% QoQ decline, partly owing to adverse cross-currency movements. The euro (EUR), Australian dollar (AUD) and Indian rupee’s (INR) weakness against the USD is likely to adversely impact dollar revenue growth by 40-100bps in 1QFY13, with the company-specific impact greater on Tata Consultancy Services (TCS, 95bps) and MindTree (90bps), given their relatively higher India exposure (61bps impact for TCS, 57bps for MindTree). TCS’ EUR and AUD billings are likely to adversely impact its reported dollar revenue by 42bps, while for MindTree its European exposure is likely to adversely impact dollar revenue by 39bps. However, rupee revenue growth is expected to get a significant boost owing to the weak currency; the average INR rate/USD in 1QFY13 was Rs54.16, down nearly 8% QoQ. Owing to this, we expect rupee revenue growth of 8-11% QoQ as compared with -0.2-2.4% QoQ growth in dollar terms. In constant currency terms, we expect revenue growth of 0.5-3.2% QoQ (TCS the highest, Infosys the lowest).

Weak rupee to boost margins: The rupee weakness is likely to boost margins of the companies in our universe for the June 2012 quarter. We expect

Wipro

, HCL Tech and MindTree to post 114bps, 130bps and 116bps expansion in margins, respectively, owing to a weak rupee and no wage hike impact, except in the case of MindTree, which will witness a one-month impact (June) for 75% of its staff. This will be more than compensated by rupee weakness and operational efficiency, and we expect MindTree to report its highest margins in nearly three years (since 2QFY10). TCS and Infosys are expected to report 105bps and 86bps fall in margins, respectively, owing to wage hikes in the case of the former, while poor growth and higher visa costs are likely to be margin headwinds for the latter. If not for weakness in the rupee, the margins for these two companies could have fallen further.

Bottom-line to benefit on higher margins, but forex losses to reduce growth: We expect

MindTree

to post 10.3% QoQ growth in net profit in 1QFY13. However, this is slower than EBITDA growth (17.4% QoQ) due to forex losses on hedging. We expect Wipro and

HCL Tech

to report 5.0% and 4.8% QoQ growth, respectively, while Infosys is likely to report a 0.3% QoQ rise. We expect

TCS

to report a 2% QoQ decline due to lower margins and forex losses.

Expect Infosys to downgrade FY13 dollar revenue guidance to 6.8-8.8%, lower currency rates to lead to rupee EPS guidance in excess of Rs175: We expect Infosys to downgrade its dollar revenue growth guidance for FY13 to 6.8-8.8% YoY (8-10% YoY earlier) on adverse cross-currency movements, as it will have to take lower end-of-period rates of the British pound (GBP), EUR and AUD against the USD for conversion. However, owing to a weaker rupee, we expect revised rupee revenue growth guidance of 25.9-28.2% (13.9-16.0% earlier) along with a 200bps improvement in EBIT margin guidance. This is likely to lead the company to significantly raise its rupee EPS guidance to more than Rs175 (Rs158.8-161.4 earlier). We expect this factor to provide downside support to the stock, even as a multiple re-rating hinges on improved growth prospects. We would watch out for comments on the slowdown in the banking space and also any signs of a cut in IT budgets (particularly on the discretionary side) or pricing pressure from select clients in the light of a weak rupee.

On CNBC-TV18's show Super Six, market gurus Manas Jaiswal of manasjaiswal.com, Arunesh Madan of Augment Investment and Rakesh Gandhi of LKP, place their bets on two stocks each, thus offering investors a variety of options to choose from. Investors can read into the detailed analysis before agreeing to any or all the bets.

Yesterday Tata Steel took support at Rs 405 and bounced back smartly. On the daily chart it made a hammer pattern, so we may see further recovery and stock can test Rs 418 in next one or two trading sessions. One can buy the stock at current levels with the stop loss of Rs 406.Yesterday PTC India broke the neckline of inverse head and shoulder pattern on the intraday chart, so now stock can move the 200 day moving average and test Rs 66 in next one or two trading sessions. One can buy the stock at current levels with a stop loss of Rs 58. HCL Tech has formed hammer pattern on the daily candlestick charts indicating that the stock may have bottomed in the very short run, besides the stock has got a very strong support in the region of Rs 449 to Rs 452. Look to buy this stock in the range of Rs 455-460 with a stop loss below Rs 449 on a closing basis and look for a target of Rs 475-480 in the coming days.I have a sell call in HUL in the range of Rs 452-454 with a stop loss being placed above Rs 458 levels as the stock has formed a bearish pattern on the daily candlestick charts. Look for a target of Rs 425-430 in the coming days.My first pick for the day is PTC . The stock has been in a sideways trend since more than four months and has a pivot level of Rs 58. It has been observed that as and when it has crossed the pivot level either up or down, the momentum increases. It is also making higher highs and higher lows and sustaining above its simple moving average of 200 days. I believe the stock could see further higher levels and hence can be bought for a target of Rs 66 with a stop loss of Rs 58.My second pick for the day is Tata Global . The stock has formed an unusual pattern of triple bottom at this point of time and stock has crossed the neckline of this triple bottom with good volumes. It has also seen a crossover of short-term moving average which would add momentum to the stock and hence can be bought for a target of Rs 125 with the stop loss of Rs 115."

Nirmal Bang has come out with its report on IT sector. The research firm recommends sell rating on Wipro and hold ratings on Infosys and HCL Tech.

The 4QFY12 IT earnings season witnessed companies with stable managements stealing a march over those that saw management changes of late, with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies outperforming Infosys and Wipro. FY13 demand commentary was more positive from TCS and HCL Tech. A common feature was the sharp post-result stock reactions, which is a sign that the increased divergence in relative performance will continue. We expect client-specific issues at Infosys and management re-organisation at Infosys and Wipro to lead to slower growth in FY13 versus TCS and HCL Tech, which have the luxury of stable management teams and can focus on driving growth in a challenging business environment. In our view, stock upside on Infosys and Wipro will be driven by the extent to which they return to a higher growth trajectory. We downgrade TCS to Sell from Hold owing to high valuation after the run-up post results. We retain our Sell rating on Wipro and Hold ratings on Infosys and HCL Tech.In 4QFY12, it was TCS and HCL Tech that outperformed Infosys and Wipro in revenue growth in US dollar terms (2.4-2.5% QoQ growth versus -1.9-2% for the latter), with stronger volume growth being the driver (3-3.3% QoQ growth versus - 1.5-0.8%). Infosys, in particular, missed its dollar revenue guidance by a huge margin (US$39mn at the upper end), one of its worst ever performances.TCS and HCL Tech appear more positive on FY13 demand, with TCS stating that it expects FY13 to be a year with front-ended growth (1H better than 2H). HCL Tech, on the other hand, has won US$2.5bn worth of orders over the past two quarters and will focus on execution, which will drive growth. On the other hand, Infosys and Wipro’s 1QFY13 dollar guidance (-1% to 1% growth range) suggests back-ended growth, which, in our view, is a challenge given an increasingly unpredictable macro environment and seasonally weaker 2H owing to lower billing days and the holiday season.The stocks of all top-tier IT majors reacted very sharply after the respective result announcements. TCS surged nearly 13% the day after its aboveexpectation results and demand commentary, while Infosys saw a similar percentage lopped off its market value after what was a highly under-whelming 4QFY12 show and FY13 outlook. Wipro shed over 7% after its poor 1QFY13 outlook, while HCL Tech gained 3% after having risen nearly 6% to the day’s high. In our view, this is an indication that the street expects the increasing divergence in relative performances to continue going forward and as regards this quarter, its stock preferences are quite clear.Post management re-organisations at Infosys and Wipro, both these IT majors have been finding it difficult to drive higher growth. The re-organisation diluted growth focus and data suggests that achieving above-industry growth in a challenging environment will not be easy. Client-specific issues continue to impact Infosys. We expect TCS and HCL Tech to outperform Infosys and Wipro on FY13 dollar revenue growth (13-15% for the former versus 7-11% for the latter two companies).Infosys and Wipro have shed 153bps and 220bps, respectively, in revenue market share over the past eight quarters, with TCS and HCL Tech gaining at their expense (294bps and 79bps improvement, respectively). Management re-organisation and slower response to the growth surge post the 2008 recession have been key reasons for loss of market share. In our view, this reflects rising divergence in relative performance, which has become starker after the 2008 recession. Clearly, peers like TCS, HCL Tech and Accenture from among the global majors have stolen a march over Infosys and Wipro, which is an indication that they are gaining client wallet share at the latter’s expense. The street is giving growth premiums to TCS and HCL Tech relative to Infosys and Wipro, and any stock rebound of the latter will be a function of the extent to which they are able to return to higher growth.Given the stock price run-up post results and high valuation, we downgrade TCS to Sell from Hold (TP Rs1,200). We retain our Sell rating on Wipro, and Hold ratings on Infosys and HCL Tech.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Way2Wealth is bullish on HCL Tech and has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 570 in its April 23, 2012 research report.

“HCL Technologies reported impressive sequential topline growth of 2.5% at a time when the entire industry is bogged down by decision delays, project scale downs and slow down in spending. In USD terms, the company reported revenue of $1048mn in Q3FY12 against our expectation of $1037mn. Growth is visible across business segments. Software services recorded a sequential growth of 1.45% backed by 2.86% of volume growth. Infrastructure management, the main growth driver of HCL, bounced back after a couple of quarters of sluggish performance with a 5 % growth sequentially. The BPO business, as committed by the management, revived with a 6.47% growth QoQ and recorded breakeven.”“HCL is not facing any client and vertical specific scale downs and the very strong order book position gives us confidence of sustained growth in the near to medium term. This is very much different from the commentary coming from the Infosys management about project specific scale downs and decision delays. But management indicated huge uncertainty in the system and lower deals in the market, especially in the BFSI space. Our estimates for FY12 and FY13 more or less remain unchanged for HCL Technologies. We expect the company’s topline to grow by 14.44% in dollar terms against the average industry growth of 11-14%. We are confident the company will outperform given the big deals it has won and the high order book position. But we don’t expect improvement in margins for FY12 and FY13 as HCL clearly targets topline growth instead of margins. The company is expected to continue its aggressive pricing strategy to tap higher market share in existing and new markets.”“We remain positive on HCL Tech in spite of the recent run up in the stock mainly driven by consistent quarterly performance and better revenue visibility. At the current market price of Rs505, HCL Technologies is trading at 15x of FY12E EPS of Rs32.74 and 13x of FY13E EPS of Rs38.62. We reiterate our “Accumulate” rating on the stock with a target price of Rs570 after discounting FY13E EPS by 15x,” says Way2Wealth research report.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

KRChoksey is bullish on HCL Tech and has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 532 in its April 19, 2012 research report.

HCL Tech , strong traction in terms of deal win continues in Q3 FY12 primarily led by run-the-segment. The company signed around $2.5 billion deals (excluding contract renewal) in the last 6 months of which around $1 billion is signed in Infrastructure Management space (IMS). The large deals win in IMS indicates that the clients are reducing the cost in run-the-business by offshoring the same and transferring the saving in pursuing change-the-business projects especially ones which are offering high ROI in short term itself. We believe, Indian IT companies (such as HCL Tech and TCS) which are offering strong value proposition in run-the-business space in the current environment (i.e. flat to negative IT budgets) will continue to outperform industry’s average growth rate in near term. Considering the company’s relatively strong positioning in “Run the Business” segment, we expect the company to report relatively higher volume growth in near term compared to peer sets and hence we upgrade our recommendation on the stock to “ACCUMULATE” from “HOLD”.”“Revenue in constant currency terms grew by 1.9% QoQ in Q3 FY12 in line with our expectation. In case of IT services volume grew by 2.9% QoQ in Q3FY12; whereas blended billing rate declined by 1.4% QoQ due to decline in onsite revenue mix by 170 bps QoQ to 56.2% in Q3 FY12. IMS and BPO registered strong growth i.e. 5.1% and 6.5%, respectively, QoQ supported by ramp-up of the deals signed in the last quarter. The management commented that in the coming quarters the growth will continue to be led by run-the-business on back of the large deal wins in recent quarters. Whereas, discretionary projects continues to be under greater scrutiny by clients and projects only which offers high ROI in short term are being under taken by the clients and hence discretionary spend will continue to be volatile in near term.”“BITDA margin declined by 12 bps QoQ to 18.4% (in INR terms) in Q3FY12 against our expectation of decline in margins by 58 bps QoQ primarily led by higher than projected improvement in margins of BPO segment. The company reported forex losses of $7.3 million in Q3FY12 against our projection of $11.8 million. Lower than estimated forex loss led higher than expected net profit of Rs.581.9 crore in Q3FY12 against our forecast of Rs.562.9 crore. Considering, huge deal win in the recent quarters; we believe the company will continue to outperform peer sets in terms of volume growth in the coming quarters. Taking the same into account we recommend ‘ACCUMULATE’ on the stock with a price target of Rs. 532 by assigning multiple of 14 times (i.e. around 25% discount to TCS’s target P/E multiple) to its FY13E EPS of Rs. 38,” says KRChoksey research report.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Other income jumped by 158% to Rs 22.7 crore and depreciation/amortization charge for the quarter was up by 1% to Rs 141.3 crore.

The resultant operating profit grew 34% to Rs 959.1 crore. Other income grew 79% to Rs 22.7 crore. PBT before forex losses grew by 38% to Rs 840.5 crore due to comparatively smaller 18% increase in depreciation/amortization charge to Rs 141.3 crore. Forex losses shot up by 224% from Rs 11.2 crore to Rs 36.3 crore which restricted the PBT after forex growth to 34% to Rs 804.2 crore. Tax provision jumped 55% to Rs 201.6 crore with effective tax rate at 25.1%, up 334bps. The resultant net profit after share of equity investment & minority interest was up 29% to Rs 602.5 crore with PAT margin higher by 24bps to 11.55%.

Nirmal Bang has recommended hold rating on HCL Tech with a target of Rs 515, in its April 18, 2012 research report.

“HCL Technologies’ revenue and margins in 3QFY12 were in line with expectations, while net profit was nearly 5% more than consensus estimates aided by higher other income and lower forex losses. Deal wins of US$1.5bn ensure decent revenue visibility for FY13, a key concern for the street and rightly so after the subdued outlook from Infosys. HCL Tech’s earnings report is a vote in favour of the “company-specific issues (read Infosys-specific)” camp. However, its stock price has risen 28% since we upgraded it to Buy in January and valuation at 12.5x FY13E EPS does not leave much room for upside. We maintain our Hold rating on the stock with a revised TP of Rs515 (Rs504), as we raise our target PE multiple to 13x (12.5x).”“HCL Technologies reported a 2.5% QoQ growth in dollar revenues to US$1,048mn (our estimate US$1,052mn), while rupee revenues fell slightly by 0.6% QoQ (Rs52.2bn versus our and consensus estimates of Rs52.9bn). Software services volume growth was slightly ahead of expectation at 3% QoQ (our estimate 2.7%); blended pricing declined 1.5% QoQ (more than our estimate of 0.8% QoQ decline). Software services revenue grew 1.5% QoQ to US$747mn (our estimate US$750mn). BPO revenues surged 6.5% QoQ to US$49mn, the fastest growth rate since 2QFY09, while infrastructure management services (IMS) grew 5.1% QoQ to US$251mn, a strong bounce-back after a sequential revenue decline in 2QFY12. HCL Tech reported an 11bps QoQ fall in EBITDA margin to 18.4%, in line with our estimate (40bps ahead of consensus). The BPO segment turned EBITDA-positive for the first time since 2QFY10 and, we believe, this could be a margin lever for FY13. Higher other income and lower forex losses aided a 5.2% QoQ rise in net profit to Rs6.03bn, ahead of our estimate by 2.1% and ahead of consensus estimates by 4.6%.”“HCL Tech’s earnings report is a vote in favour of the “company-specific issues (read Infosys-specific)” camp. However, after a 28% rise in the stock over the past three months, valuation at 12.5x FY13E EPS is on the higher side. We retain our Hold rating on the stock with a revised TP of Rs515 (Rs504), as we raise our target PE multiple to 13x (12.5x),” says Nirmal Bang research report.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Emkay Global Financial Services is bullish on HCL Tech and has recommended accumulate rating on the stock with a target of Rs 560 in its April 18, 2012 research report.

“After the sharp disappointment from Infosys last week, HCL Tech’s March’12 performance provides a sigh of relief in our view. While revenue growth at 2.5% QoQ fell short of expectations mildly ( we estimated a 3.2% QoQ growth), we note that both IMS and BPO segments recorded an impressive 5.1%/6.5% QoQ revenue growth with IT services dragging growth at 1.5% QoQ ( volume growth at 2.9% QoQ). EBITDA margins (including ESOP charge) were down by ~10 bps QoQ at 18% (V/s expectations of ~90 bps improvement) with the improvement in profitability in the BPO segment negated by margin declines in the IMS segment ( margins declined by ~140 bps QoQ despite ~5% QoQ revenue growth). While HC addition was muted in IT Services (increased by ~79 QoQ), reduction in BPO headcount led to an overall decline of ~9% QoQ led to an overall headcount reduction. Metrics performance was mixed with top 5/10 clients growing higher than co average for the 2nd quarter in a row and an improvement across client buckets albeit performance in Financial Services and US were weak ( down by ~2.7% QoQ / 1.1% QoQ respectively).”“Street has raised concerns on predictability with HCL Tech in the past however recent performances should lend more confidence on execution in our view. HCLT has also done well in bagging large deals in the past 2 qtrs (US$ 1.5 bn worth deals in March’12 qtr on the back of US$ 1 bn worth deals won in Dec’11 qtr) that not only lends higher visibility in a volatile demand environment but also helps company strengthen position in inherent areas of weakness like Financial Services (note that of the US$ 2.5 bn worth TCV secured by the company, ~40% comes from Financial services vertical). We appreciate management’s strategy of focusing on delivery execution over the next few quarters given that it has already built a significant order book. Management remains confident of sustaining 14% EBIT margins over foreseeable future unlike CY09-10 when rampup on the large deals won in OND’08 drove a decline in overall margin profile for the company.”“Given improving predictability in financial performance (read: revenue growth coupled with stable margins’), we assign a 13x multiple on June’14E earnings (along with rollover to June’14 V/s June’13 earlier) drives a raise in our TP to Rs 560. Upgrade HCL Tech to ACCUMULATE V/s HOLD earlier. Our order of preference within the sector remains unchanged at Infosys, HCL Tech, TCS and Wipro in that order,” says Emkay Global Financial Services research report.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Prabhudas Lilladher has come out with its earnings estimates on IT sector for March quarter FY12. The research firm remains neutral in the near term, but optimistic about the back-ended growth and expects the guidance and outlook to be soft.

Prabhudas Lilladher results estimates on IT sector for Q4FY12:

The cautious tone for the near term is likely to be a stance maintained by the management in the commentary. We expects the guidance and outlook to be soft. However, we expect management to highlight no cut in the IT budget, pricing pressure and increased offshoring due to cost take-off to drive the growth. However, the commentary on Europe is likely to be cautious despite good growth in the previous quarter. The seasonality would push growth by ~1% QoQ. Our channel check suggests improving demand scenario.

PINC Research has come out with its report on IT sector. The research firm has prefered Infosys , TCS and HCL Tech from large caps and NIIT Tech , MindTree and Hexaware from mid-caps.

Clients have broadly finished their budget exercise and the global macro uncertainty is likely to delay discretionary spending but thrust offshoring. The momentum in project ramp-up is expected to begin from Q1FY13. Companies have not revealed their hiring plan for the next fiscal. But the large tier firms have given a commentary to outperform the guidance. Aggressive mid-tier IT firms confident to grow above industry average. Due to soft demand environment, firms want to innovate through IP revenues and build expertise in emerging technologies like cloud computing and mobility. This will allow participation in complex and innovative deals which are incrementally growing at faster pace.

A few mid-cap firms have kept the revenue growth momentum to match the higher end of the spectrum. Margin fluctuations in certain companies have been higher leading to uncertainty. The possibility of pricing increase in FY13 is low hence levers like offshoring, utilisation will come into play. Companies with good revenue growth momentum can benefit from change in employee mix. Top picks - Infosys among large caps; NIIT Tech, MindTree and Hexaware among mid-caps."

After a see-saw performance in H1FY12 against expectation, Q3FY12 performance of Tier-1 Indian IT Services (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCLT) have been in-line with expectation. However, softer-than-expected volume growth has been compensated by efficiency drive in fixed-price projects. The new clients win has been healthy, but top clients have been a drag for Tier-1.

The improvement in the November IIP was mainly due to the manufacturing sector and the positive base effect.Though it is certain that the RBI is not going to tighten the monetary policy - as suggested by the RBI Governor in a statement - whether it will reverse the trend and up to what extent will be the single most important cue for the movement of the markets, is what needs to be seen.On the Put Call Ratio open interest (PCR OI) front for the Nifty, the continuous increase in its value from 1 to the current level of 1.26, as on 13th January, suggests an increase in Put activity, which is expected to be dominated by sellers, hinting at a bullish stance in the market.The increase in OI by around 20% and more than a 5% rise in the Nifty Futures in the January series suggest a positive outlook for the Nifty. Hence, market participants can consider buying on dips around the 4,720-4,750 levels.On the Nifty Options front, the short-term downside seems to be limited as 4,800 and 4,700 Put has significant amounts of OI build-up of over 5.8 million and 7.7 million, respectively. On the Call side, 5,000 has the maximum OI build-up of over 6.8 million, followed by 4,900, which will act as an expiry base and immediate resistance for the market.Technically, the short-term trend has turned slightly positive, but the overall medium trend remains cautious and weak. The Index has observed volatile trading sessions since the past few days. The pattern suggests an immediate resistance at the 4,880 level and has support at the 4,800 level. The Nifty is also trading below its long-term 100-200 day moving averages, which is also not a healthy sign.The current month"

GEPL Capital has come out with its report on Colgate Palmolive and HCL Tech.

: COLPAL has been in continuously falling mode after hitting a high of 1085 in Nov-2011. This stock has remained an outperformer during the entire fall of Nifty but has been beaten down in last four to six weeks. Technically speaking, during all the previous fall this stock was taking support on its 200-DSMA and starting a fresh run from that point but in last three trading session it has breached its important support area and given a close below its 200-DSMA that too with above average volume which indicates that bulls are losing the battle. The On- Balance-Volume indicator is indicating that smart money is flowing out of this counter. On the weekly chart ,the stock has given close below its 26-WEMA indicating medium to long term reversal on trend. Keeping all this things in mind, we suggest going short in this counter at current market price as well as on rise in the range of 970-980 with a stop loss placing for a target of 850.: HCL Tech has outperformed Nifty in the current countertrend rally which has emerged from 4530(Nifty) to 4870 area. After giving a move of almost more than 12% from a low of 380(Hcl Tech) this stock is showing signs of exhaustion on daily as well as on weekly charts. Daily chart of this stock is showing certain bearish indications which can drag down the price further in coming time. The stock has given a sell signal on crossover indicator (13-50 EMA crossover) as well as it has given breakdown from its sideways trend (range trading breakdown) that too with above average volumes indicating that bears are taking control in this counter. Since it has fallen sharply in last four trading session resulting in oversold territory in most of the momentum indicators, a temporary bounce back may come which can lift up this counter up to the area of 410-415 in this relief rally. For positional traders this relief rally will provide an opportunity to exit the long stuck up position or create fresh short side. position in this area with a stop placing at 428 for a target of 372.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

PINC Research has come out with its report on power pics for December 2011. The research firm has shared its view on Ashok Leyland, Ashoka Buildcon, Bajaj Auto, CESC, HCL Tech, HSIL, Infosys, IRB Infrastructure, Jagran Prakashan, Jyothy Laboratories, Mahindra & Mahindra, Nestle India, NIIT Tech, Phoenix Mills, Power Grid Corporation and Tecpro Systems.

ASHOK LEYLAND

Ashok Leyland dispatches in Q3FY11 has been lower due to the pre-buying and pipeline stocking related to change in emission norms. We expect

Ashok Leyland volumes to grow 15.6% in H2FY12 partly aided by the low base of Q3FY11. 2) Management expects to increase contribution from

Pantnagar facility from 13k units in H1FY12 to 20k units in H2FY12. We expect FY12 margins at 10.8% driven by higher contribution from the

Pantnagar facility which is eligible for fiscal benefits. 3) Benefits of Pantnagar operations are already visible in AL's profitability during H1FY12 wherein

despite inflationary pressures and low volumes, it has managed to have operating margins at ~10%. 4) Ashok Leyland's JV with Nissan for LCVs

launched its first product 'Dost' recently. The company targets a sale of 10k units in H2FY12. Our earnings estimates for FY11 and FY12 are Rs2.5

and Rs3.1 respectively. Our FY12 earnings estimate is 9% higher than the consensus estimate of Rs2.3. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the

stock with a target price of Rs38, which discounts FY13E earnings by 12.5x.

We believe, Ashoka Buildcon (ABL), a well experienced BOT road player with 18 operational project and 6 projects of ~2500kms under construction, is likely to become a prominent player in road infra over the next 3 years. However, due to unhealthy industry and market dynamics the stock is available at a sharp discount of P/BV 0.9x, which we believe does not reflect a long term average valuation for the company. Our FY12 and FY13 earnings estimates are Rs18.5 and Rs25.5, 14.2% and 16.3% lower than consensus estimates respectively. We expect top-line growth of 29.3% and 30.1% to Rs16.8bn and Rs21.9bn in FY12E and FY13E vs. consensus forecasts of 28.2% and 32.5% to Rs16.7bn and Rs22.1bn, respectively. We value BOT (on a DCF basis) at FY12E and FY13E equity multiples of 1.6x and 1.1x, respectively. Our SOTP-based target price is Rs321, where BOT is valued at Rs198 and EPC at Rs122 (8x FY12E earnings). The stock offers an upside potential of 73.4% at our SOTP-based target price of Rs321 vs. consensus target of Rs323.

The high-margin brands Pulsar and Discover, now account for 70% of the Bajaj Auto's motorcycle sales thus validating its brand-centric strategy. The company is scheduled to launch a complete upgrade of the Pulsar family and KTM branded motorcycles in Q4FY12. In addition, continued demand for three-wheelers and robust exports would help Bajaj Auto achieve volume growth of 16.2% in FY12E and 11.9% in FY13E. Export profitability is all set to get a boost due to the price hikes taken and the rupee depreciation. Our FY12 and FY13 earnings estimates are Rs107.5 and Rs123.3, respectively. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs1,850 discounting FY13E earnings at 15x. Our FY12 earnings estimate is 1.2% higher than the consensus estimate of Rs106.2.

CESC is one of the most efficient power utilities operating at more than 85% PLF. It plans to nearly double its installed capacity to 2.4GW by FY15 by adding 600MW each at Chandrapur and Haldia - power from these projects will be sold largely on long term basis. Unlike its private sector peers, CESC currently has no merchant exposure and operates all existing units under a regulatory framework - thus aiding steady cash flow. All power generated from these units is sold to its distribution arm, thus reducing risk of backingdown and default. We believe a robust base business would generate sufficient cash to fund capex of the consolidated entity and Spencer's losses. At the current market price, the generating business is available at 0.5x FY13 book, thus making CESC the most attractive generator in our coverage universe. Our FY12 & FY13 PAT estimates are in line with consensus. We value various projects - both existing and future - on FCFE basis to arrive at a target price of Rs346 (terminal growth rate 3% and cost of equity 15%).

HCL Tech has capability to win new projects due to its strengths in IMS and package implementation (through AXON) particularly when project restructuring deals are growing faster. HCL Tech is focused on developing capabilities in Enterprise Mobility, Cloud Computing and Analytics to complement its existing offerings and is looking for acquisitions for the same. It has potential to improve margins on the back of an improving employee pyramid and scale efficiencies. Our revenue. EBITDA margin and EPS estimates for FY12 are higher than consensus by 2.1%, 78 bps and 9.3% respectively. For FY13; our revenue, EBITDA margin and EPS estimates marginally lag the consensus by 1.3%, 39bps and 1% respectively.

HSIL operates in 2 business segments, sanitary ware and container glass. Strong recall of the flagship sanitaryware brands, Hindware Art and Hindware Italian Collection, enhance HSIL's market leadership with 40% share in organised sanitaryware market and advantageous location of container glass plants have helped achieve a 70% market share in south India. Our earnings estimates (EPS) for FY12 and FY13 are Rs20.1 and Rs27.4, respectively. Our FY12 earnings estimate is 11% higher than consensus estimate of Rs18.1. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs270, which discounts FY12e earnings by 13.5x.

We recommend staying with the leader during uncertain times. Infosys has a full-services portfolio with exposure to well-diversified verticals. The new management appears more aggressive on aspects such as inorganic growth and is looking for acquisitions in healthcare vertical and for increasing presence in Europe. Our revenue estimate is marginally higher than consensus at 0.5% for FY12 and is in line with consensus for FY13. EBITDA margin estimates are higher by 110bps for FY12 and 28 bps for FY13. While our EPS estimate is 2% higher than consensus EPS for FY12, it is in line with consensus for FY13.

Despite the infra segment languishing due to fundamental issues, we believe road BoT segment would fare well and we prefer IRB due to its unique ability to manage and win competitive projects. We strongly believe in IRB's ability to grow and sustain its strong business model. 1) Lower IRR owing to further increase in interest rates; 2) Strain on the balance sheet from infusion of Rs12.8bn in equity in Ahm-Vado project; 3) Lower traffic growth; and 4) adverse impact on IRB's tolling charges from any change in the government policy.

We like JPL for its leadership in the UP market (the largest print market in terms of readership and print ad value). We believe the company is well poised to benefit from steady growth in the print media sector, underpinned by: 1) its well-entrenched position in growing regions such as Bihar and Jharkhand; 2) phased and planned expansion into new media businesses; and 3) a wide portfolio (including Mid-day, I-next and Cityplus). JPL's well-balanced business model (more than 30% revenue from circulation and other media businesses), its growth strategy to further increase penetration in terms of circulation in its current market, and monetisation of its readership insulates it from slowdown in advertisements due to the current macroeconomic scenario. Our FY13 revenue estimate is 5% below consensus. However, our FY13 EPS estimate of Rs8 is in-line with estimates. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs148 (18xFY13E EPS).

In our opinion, Jyothy Laboratories (Jyothy) 23% correction in the stock price in the past 6 months has factored all the near term worry. Jyothy's standalone business should recover in H2FY12 onwards and we believe except Maxo the dynamics of the standalone business are still at the same level. We are bullish on turnaround performance of Henkel India (Henkel) and its profitable performance since acquisition has been encouraging. Jyothy is among the few companies in the FMCG space which has immense potential for long-term profitability growth. Our estimates for FY13 are among the highest on the street, led by expectation of better performance of the core business and sustainability of Henkel's profitable performance. We assign 16x to FY13E earnings and add Rs12/share NPV on tax saving of Rs1.2bn @12% discount rate to derive the TP of Rs212.

An extensive product range has helped M&M maintain its dominance in the utility vehicle (UV) and pick-up segments and maintain healthy margins despite raw material cost increases. During FY12, we expect doubledigit growth of 13.2% in the automotive segment. A normal monsoon this fiscal and expectation of higher crop yields bode well for the tractor segment; we expect 11% growth in the tractor segment. Our FY12 and FY13 earnings forecast are Rs45.7 and Rs52.9 respectively. Our FY12 earning estimate is 1.2% higher than the consensus estimate of Rs45.2. We value M&M at Rs877 using SOTP methodology, discounting the standalone business at 13x FY13E earnings.

Nestle's monopoly in Maggi noodles would be difficult to maintain for long period post the entrance of big players. Competition is rising in almost all the categories while Nestle is expanding capacities which would force the company to maintain volume market share. Higher marketing efforts would be required for retaining leadership position which would exert pressure on profitability. In the past 6 months, Nestle underperformed FMCG sector by ~8% resulting in the reduction in P/E premium over FMCG sector to ~31% from ~45%. Despite, we believe valuations are still very expensive. Our estimates and target price are lower than the consensus, led by the expectation of pressure on EBITDA margin and argument of narrowing down of the Nestle's valuation premium. We assign P/E of 30x on the next 12-months earnings to derive TP of Rs3,578.

NIIT Tech has large exposure to high-growth niche verticals such as insurance and travel. Recent acquisition of Proyecta Sistemas and JV with Morris, will give further thrust to growth through access to untapped markets and presence in newer industries. New service lines would boost non-linear growth and lead to improvement in realisations. Moreover, it has a differentiated strategy with development of IPs in emerging technologies (such as cloud computing) & verticals (such as insurance & healthcare). Our top-line estimate for FY12 is marginally higher by 1.8% than consensus and is in line with consensus for FY13. Our EBITDA margin estimates are marginally lower by 11bps and 25bps for FY12 and FY13 respectively. Our EPS estimates for FY12 & FY13 varies from consensus by 1.3% and (4.2%) respectively.

PHNX's key project, High Street Phoenix (HSP), is now fully operational and is likely to generate rental income of Rs2-2.2bn in FY12E. In Q1FY12, the Pune Market City (PHNX stake: 58.5%) was launched and Bengaluru Market City was launched in Q3FY12. This will help strengthen the company's rental model. At present, PHNX's rental revenue (FY11: Rs1,8bn) comes from HSP and the launch of Pune and Bangalore Market City is likely to add ~Rs550mn of rental revenue to the top line in FY12E. Our EPS estimates for FY12 and FY13 are Rs10.8 and Rs11.9, respectively. Our FY12 earnings estimate is 30% higher than consensus estimate of Rs8.3. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs265, which discounts FY12E gross NAV by 15%.

PGCIL is moving ahead to achieve its XIth plan capex and capitalisation target of Rs550bn (76% achieved till H1FY12) and Rs320bn (82% achieved till H1FY12) respectively. It aims to significantly ramp up its capex over the XIIth Plan period, as it seeks to nearly double this to Rs1.02trn. It intends to achieve a yearly capex and ordering run rate of ~Rs200bn and ~Rs180bn respectively during the XIIth Plan. This increased capex run rate should translate into 20% CAGR in its regulated equity over FY11-15E. In addition, PGCIL is insulated from risks like rising fuel cost, backing down and SEB defaults (as payments are secured through a tripartite agreement). We believe the stock offers safe and steady returns as compared to its private sector peers. Our FY12 & FY13 PAT estimates are in line with consensus. We value PGCIL on FCFE basis to arrive at a target price of Rs120 (terminal growth rate 3% and 13% Ke).

Most of the power BoP orders pertaining to the XIIth Five-Year Plan (including orders for coal and ash handling) are yet to be awarded. Tecpro appears best placed among peers to bag these orders, given its past experience. If interest rates stabilise in the near term, we expect incremental order inflows to come from the cement, steel, minerals and mining sectors. A healthy (1.6x FY12E revenue) and safe (all orders have achieved financial closure) order book minimises the risk of any delay or cancellations. We expect EPS of Rs31 and Rs37.4 in FY12E and FY13E, respectively, almost in line with consensus forecasts. We expect 9% growth in order inflow in FY12, whereas some analysts forecast de-growth of ~30-35%. However, the management has guided for ~30% growth in order inflow in FY12. We have a BUY recommendation with a target price of Rs 375 (10x FY13E).

On CNBC-TV18's new show Super Six, market gurus Rajesh Jain, EVP Retail Research of Religare Sec, Aditya Agarwal, Sr Derivative Analyst of Way2Wealth Securities and Hemen Kapadia, CEO of chartpundit.com, place their bets on two stocks each, thus offering investors a variety of options to choose from. Investors can read into the detailed analysis before agreeing to any or all the bets.

Yesterday the markets have taken a good counter rally from lower levels. Bajaj Auto has been holding at higher levels and can give a good rally. One can buy near Rs 1720 which is its important support keeping a stoploss of Rs 1700 for a target of Rs 1800. JSW Steel had a good rally yesterday. One can buy the stock near Rs 665 with a stoploss of Rs 655 and target of Rs 700. Areva T&D has made a veg pattern and has managed to close above the neckline support area of Rs 198-199. With this the stock has also made a hammer pattern on daily charts which is a bullish signal. So we are expecting this stock may recover from lower levels and can test Rs 214-215 on higher side. So at CMP long positions can be initiated with stoploss of Rs 195 and target of Rs 214. HCL Tech has closed below its crucial neckline support area of Rs 420 and with this also seen some short positions in the whole IT pack. So we are expecting that HCL Tech will continue its downward journey and on the lower side can test Rs 390 levels. So any bounce back should be used to make short positions with stoploss of Rs 424 and target of Rs 390. Tata Motors has taken support on the 55 day exponential moving average. There has been an oversold situation from Tata Motors in a mood to bounce back. It looks good from a short term point of view. Keeping that in mind one can buy at Rs 182 with a stoploss of Rs 179 and target of Rs 188. This is a shorter term call valid from an intraday point of view. Tata Steel has given an upward key reversal on the daily chart which is a good sign. Stock is also deeply oversold. One can buy it at 406. This is a shorter term call valid from an intraday point of view."

ASHOKA BUILDCON

: BUY, TP-Rs 363 (51% upside)

Our FY12 and FY13 earnings estimates are Rs 21.6 and Rs 25.7, 12.1% and 15.3% lower than consensus estimates respectively. We expect top-line growth of 54.4% and 15.6% to Rs 20.1bn and Rs 23.3bn in FY12 and FY13 vs. consensus forecasts of 46.8% and 21.5% to Rs 19.1bn and Rs 23.2bn, respectively. We value BOT (on a DCF basis) at FY12E and FY13E equity multiples of 1.6x and 1.1x, respectively. Our SOTP-based target price is Rs 363, where BOT is valued at Rs 218 and EPC at Rs 145 (9x FY12E earnings). The stock offers an upside potential of 51% at our SOTP-based target price of Rs 363 vs. consensus target of Rs 344.

Our FY12 and FY13 earnings estimates are Rs 107.5 and Rs 123.3, respectively. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,850 discounting FY13E earnings at 15x. Our FY12 earnings estimate is 1.2% higher than the consensus estimate of Rs 106.3.

Our FY13 revenue estimate is 5% below consensus. However, our FY13 EPS estimate of Rs 8 is in-line with estimates. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 148 (18xFY13E EPS).

JYOTHY LABORATORIES

: BUY, TP-Rs 212 (53% upside)

Our estimates for FY13 are among the highest on the street, led by expectation of better performance of the core business and sustainability of Henkel's profitable performance.

HCL Technologies, India's fourth largest software services firm, slumped as much as 9% on Tuesday, as traders were disappointed by its in-line earnings and hurt by concerns about the global economic slowdown.

HCL, which counts Microsoft, IBM, HP and Oracle as partners, said consolidated profit jumped 50% to 4.97 billion rupees for July-Sept on growth across geographies and categories.Revenue rose 25.4% to 46.51 billion rupees, on an average exchange rate basis.""This extent of share fall is not justified,"" said Rohit Anand, an analyst at PINC Research, adding that the stock was probably correcting the swift run up it has had ahead of the results.HCL shares, valued at more than USD 6 billion, gained 14% in a month in a broader market that was little changed. At close, its shares were down 8.75% at 401.60 rupees in a Mumbai market that was down 1.63%.A Reuters poll of brokerages showed analysts expected HCL Tech's profit to rise 45.6% to 4.81 billion rupees, on revenue of 47.7 billion rupees.The share was also hurt by a rising concern about global slowdown after comments from the German finance minister against a quick-fix to Europe's debt problems, slowing growth in China and a warning on France's sovereign credit rating.For HCL, the volume growth of just 4.1% in dollar terms on the quarter was a little negative as it reflected a slowing demand, Anand said.A lower-than-expected earnings by India's top software exporter Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) late on Monday, has clouded the outlook for the outsourcing sector.India's USD 76 billion showpiece IT sector, which feeds off increased outsourcing by companies looking to cut costs, is expected to face pricing pressure and a decline in new orders as Europe struggles with a debt crisis and the United States sees an economic slowdown.""The macro environment looks bleak but the economic opportunity for HCL looks strong,"" said chief executive Vineet Nayar.HCL is betting big on massive vendor churn underway in the outsourcing sector, whereby overseas clients are looking for new vendors to renew their contracts.Quoting information service group TPI, Nayar said deals worth USD 8 billion will come up for renewal in Oct-Dec quarter. Europe will continue to be a big growth driver for the firm, Nayar said.Overall IT budgets for overseas clients are 'either static or probably going down', Nayar said, adding that a clarity on new spending by clients will emerge in the January quarter.The pricing environment was stable at present, Nayar said.HCL Tech expects to clock an EBIT margin of 14% on constant currency basis for FY12 that ends in June.The operating margin expanded to 17.1% for the Sept-quarter from 16.3% a year-ago but was lower from 18.5% in the June quarter on account of wage hike and fresh hiring.HCL signed 12 deals and added 3,474 employees on a net basis during July-Sept."

HCL Tech is looking weak, says Amit Gupta, ICICI Direct.

In TCS around Rs 1150 levels where we have the highest call base now again that is a very critical resistance. I think the weakest of TCS , Infosys and HCL Tech is HCL Tech because that is still trading below the 100 day moving average and the rest of the these two stocks are trading above the 100 day moving average.""""In HCL Tech I think at Rs 450 where the 100 day moving average lies will remain a very immediate resistance and I think it is possible once we have seen that there will be a bit of disappointing results from TCS, you can see immediate profit booking coming in HCL Tech also and in that scenario the stock may trade little bit subdued and may come down till Rs 420 levels too.""agupta_it_18oct"

Dolat Capital has come out with its report on IT space.

: A recent survey across America and Europe suggests that clients are confident about their IT spends and off-shoring strategy. Up to 80% of the respondents expect no slowdown or deferment in FY11. However, they have not yet fixed their plans for FY12. Europe is seeing some signs of a slowdown, especially among the financial services clientele. The sovereign crisis in France and Germany could impact materially, considering the large exposure by Indian vendors. Gartner feels that if recession fears come true, it may lead to sluggish demand for 3-6 quarters. But it could also create strong latent demand that will turn beneficial for offshore players in long term as clients look to save costs.: Pricing could play a pivotal role considering the wage hike (higher in the current season at 12-15%) and attrition-led cost pressure. Pricing cuts could also act as a momentum-building strategy as formulated by HCL and Cognizant in 2008. Infosys apparently is cutting prices to improve its deal-win ratio. Of late, Infy has quoted rates of USD 28-29 per hour for offshore efforts, implying a cut of about 15% from its traditional quote of USD 34-35 per man-hour billed. The softening suggests desperation and may lead to some margin dilution. HCL Tech is also continuing its undercut strategy to break into new engagements and contradicts its claim of superior capabilities that parallel global giants. Interestingly, TCS and Cognizant have been asking for a rate hike of 8-10% (15-17 enquiries), largely to compensate for COLA (cost-of-living adjustments) rise. About 40% of their clients have agreed for a 7-8% price hike. This strategy will shield vendors on pricing cuts to a certain extent if the scenario worsens.: Typically, Indian vendors enter an engagement with small (USD 4-6mn) T&M deals and gradually expand their offshore pie. However; of late the bigger Indian vendors have lowered their focus on smaller deals, resulting in unsatisfactory outcomes from the client

It looks like things are turning somewhat positive for the Indian IT sector. After the sharp fall in the rupee, the sector is looking forward to a slew of international opportunities coming its way.

BNP Paribas has downgraded Indian it companies like Infosys, TCS, Wipro, HCL Tech, MindTree and Persistent to reduce. BNP thinks they are yet to reflect a likely prolonged anemic macro growth scenario. Moreover, we are yet to see material consensus downgrades since the macro data has started worsening.

Standard Chartered has maintained an outperform stance on Tata Motors , but has cut target to Rs 1,269 . Tata Motors has corrected 35% in the past six months on fears that slowdown in the US and Europe would impact Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) earnings. The current price factors in a pessimistic scenario of lacklustre volume on the standalone business and significant margin erosion at JLR.Standard Chartered has maintained an in line rating on Reliance Communications , but has cut its target to Rs 89 from Rs 110. Stanchart has cut FY12 earnings by 21% to factor in higher finance costs. Given its weak competitive positioning, it could get more challenging for reliance communications to keep pace with peers post the tariff hikes, Stanchart said.UBS has reiterated a buy on Jindal Saw , but has cut target to Rs 205. UBS has retained its positive outlook on the stock and expects it to re-rate from the current low valuations."

PINC Research has come out with its report on 13 stock picks for the month of July.

Top-Shelf Selections- July 2011:

: We value ABL's BOT project (DCF basis) at equity multiple of 1.6x and 1.1x FY12E and FY13E. Our SOTP-based target price is Rs 363, with BOT valued at Rs 208 and EPC at Rs 155 at 9x FY12E earnings. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock.

: Our FY12 and FY13 earnings estimates are Rs 107.5 and Rs123.3 respectively. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 1665, discounting FY13E earnings at 13.5x. Our FY12 earnings estimate is 6.1% higher than consensus estimate of Rs101.3.

: Our FY12 EBITDA stands 22% above consensus as we expect improved performance from Ardent Steel. For Ardent Steel, we assume CU of 60% in FY12E and 70% in FY13E. Buy the stock with a target of Rs 278.

: Our revenue estimates vary from consensus by ~(1)% for FY12 and for FY13 it is in line with consensus, underpinned by stronger volumes and modest uptick in pricing. Our EBITDA margin forecast for FY12 and FY13 is higher than consensus by 70bps and 20bps respectively. Our FY12 EPS estimate is in line with consensus whereas for FY13 it is 1% higher than consensus. Buy the stock with a target of Rs 630.

: Our FY12E and FY13E earnings estimates are at Rs14.0 and Rs10.5, which are 5.3% and 36.1% lower than consensus estimates respectively. We expect top-line growth of 27.7% at Rs 31.1bn for FY12E and 18.1% at Rs36.7bn for FY13E vs. consensus estimate of 36.1% at Rs33.2bn and 30.7% at Rs43.4bn respectively. We believe the recent correction in stock price provides a good entry point for long-term investors. The stock offers an upside potential of 20.9% at our SOTP-based target price of Rs 227 vs. consensus target of Rs 234.

(JPL): Our revenue estimate for FY13 is 3% above consensus. However our EPS estimate of Rs8.3 for FY13 is 7.5% below consensus. Buy the stock with a target of Rs 150.

: Our estimates for FY13 are among the highest on the street, led by expectation of profitability improvement in Henkel India and 50% debt repayment during FY13. We assign 16x to FY13 earnings and add Rs12/ share NPV on tax saving of Rs1.2bn @12% discount rate to derive the TP of Rs265.

(M&M): We expect EPS of Rs41.6 and Rs 47.9 in FY12 and FY13 respectively. Our FY12 earnings estimate is 8.8% lower than consensus estimate of Rs45.6. We value M&M using SOTP at Rs 836, discounting the standalone business at 13x FY13E earnings.

: Our estimates and target price are among the lowest on the street, led by pressure on EBITDA margin and argument of narrowing down the Nestle's P/E premium to 25%. We assign P/E of 30x on next 12-months earnings to derive TP of Rs 3208.

: Our top-line estimates for FY12 and FY13 is in line with consensus, underpinned by stronger volumes and modest uptick in pricing. Our EBITDA margin estimate for FY12 is 20.4% and for FY13 is 20.3%, in line with consensus. Our EPS estimate for FY12 is 1.2% and for FY13 is 5.8% higher than consensus.

: Our EPS estimates for FY12 and FY13 are Rs14.3 and Rs15.8 respectively. Our FY12 earnings estimate is 45% higher than consensus estimate of Rs9.1. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 240, which discounts FY12E Gross NAV by 20%.

: Our earnings estimates (EPS) for FY12 and FY13 are Rs20.2 and Rs23.6 respectively. Our FY12 earnings estimate is 19% higher than consensus estimate of Rs19.9. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs240, which discounts FY12E earnings by 12x.

: Our consol.estimates are lower than the street. We value Tata Steel at Rs 713 using SOTP methodology.

Upside capped in TCS in the short term, says Anil Manghnani, Modern Shares & Stock Brokers.

Manghnani told CNBC-TV18, ""I guess that couple of days back it seems to be the same thing repeated last quarter where once Infosys came out with negative numbers and the stock got hammered, clear shift, people who have to still balance their portfolios are moving or will move to TCS and HCL Tech may be. So I am not surprised that TCS is bouncing today post the numbers, it has got a lot of support at lower levels. For a trading point of view Rs 1114 was a support that it tested close to yesterday and even after Infosys, but it keeps bouncing from that.""He further added, ""In the short run, may be the upside is capped because the market is stuck a little bit. Every time it comes to Rs 1200 it finds a lot of resistance and supply. So may be in the short-term Rs 1200-1230 may be capped but I think in the medium-term whenever you get a bigger dip like you had a month back where the stock was back to Rs 1050-1060, I think there you will find a lot of buying interest.""""So from a trading point of view little stretched but on every fall it could be because of the good corporate governance, but technically also the monthly chart is still very strong and I think every dip you will see a lot of buying interest especially from the guys who are moving out of Infosys and looking for something else in the IT pack."""

Sharekhan has come out with its report on top picks. The broking house has handpicked 11 stocks for investment.

: Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) is a premier power generation equipment manufacturer and a leading EPC company. It has emerged as the prime beneficiary of the four-fold increase in the investments in the power sector in India. BHEL currently has orders worth Rs164,130 crore on hand, which provides revenue coverage for the next three to four years. We believe the order inflow momentum would remain strong for the company. However, the key challenge for BHEL would be the timely execution of projects. The company has already expanded its capacity to 15GW in FY11. Also, the project to expand the capacity to 20GW by FY12 is being executed on a fast track. In our view, the stabilisation of the new capacity coupled with the de-bottlenecking of the supply chain would aid order execution and sustain robust growth in BHEL
