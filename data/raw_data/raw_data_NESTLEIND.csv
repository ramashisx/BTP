Multinational Companies (MNCs) will have to redo their Return on Investment (ROI) and cost benefit analysis as a result of the Supreme Court’s recent ruling on Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA), experts said. The ruling was given on an appeal filed by the Income Tax Department.

Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that parties cannot avail of benefits under DTAA unless Indian tax authorities explicitly notify it. Simply put, the apex court has held that even if India enters into a DTAA with a nation, one cannot avail of benefits under it, unless it is woven into the country’s laws by a notification. Countries enter into DTAA to avoid taxation on the same income by two countries, if a person or a company earns income in country A from an investment in country B, tax will have to be paid only in one country depending on the terms of DTAA.

The court ruled this while interpreting the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause in the DTAA treaties between India and the Netherlands, France, and Switzerland. The MFN clause provides for lowering of rate of taxation at source on dividends, interest, royalties or fees for technical services (FTS). As per the MFN clause, when a country gives trade concessions to a member country of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), it must be given to all. However, the SC was called upon to decide on whether the MFN clause is applicable to a third country, which was not an OECD member when India entered the agreement, but became a member at a later date.

The SC has also held that “For a party to claim benefit of a “same treatment” clause, based on entry of DTAA between India and another state which is member of OECD, the relevant date is entering into treaty with India, and not a later date, when, after entering into DTAA with India, such country becomes an OECD member, in terms of India’s practice.”

As a result of this judgment, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) from the Netherlands will be subject to 10 percent withholding tax rather than 5 percent withholding tax, thereby reducing their RoI from India. The Netherlands and France have consistently been in the top 10 FPIs of 2023.

Rohit Jain, Managing Partner at law firm Singhania & Co said “This will increase cost of repatriation i.e. capital return becomes costlier as higher tax incidence will have to be factored in. Dutch / French / Swiss companies doing business in India and companies considering setting up new businesses in India will have to redo the cost benefit and ROI analysis.”

“The judgment will have a swift and immediate impact on global businesses who are earning revenues or are required to pay monies for cross border transactions subject to tax. For global recipients, they will have to contend with an increased rate of taxation on their incomes,” opined Pallav Pradyumn Narang, Partner at Chartered Accountants firm, CNK.

Noting that the judgment is itself based on a principle of law and not on foreign relations with these countries, Sonam Chandwani, Managing Partner KS Legal & Associates said “This ruling could prompt a re-evaluation of tax strategies and structures, potentially affecting the flow of investments and services. The emphasis on explicit notifications may also lead to demands for greater clarity in future tax treaties to avoid such ambiguities.""

Authorities may consider reassessment

Experts have also said that the authorities may even consider reassessing taxation on past transactions owing to this judgment.

“Previously executed transactions, based upon the earlier held norms, will come back into the limelight and will invite reassessment notices from the tax department,” Narang said while noting that the party remitting the income will now have to recalibrate the system to update it with the new tax rate.

Similarly, Vishesh Malviya, Partner at Rashmikant and Partners said, “It may adversely impact companies, which have already taken benefits of such rates of taxes, as the Income tax authorities may re-open cases in view of the judgment.”

How did the case reach SC?

In 2021, the Delhi High Court held that no separate notification is required to be passed by the government for parties to avail of the benefits under DTAA. The Income Tax Department filed an appeal against this judgment. At the SC, the IT Department argued that India follows the “dualist” practice, which means that international treaties and conventions are not, upon their ratification, automatically assimilated into municipal law (i.e. the national legal system) but would require enabling legislation. This is in contrast to those countries which are “monist”, wherein the treaty provisions are enforceable like municipal law, and are to be given equal weight by courts. The court accepted the department’s arguments."

Nestle India is expected to outperform its FMCG counterparts, by reporting strong earnings growth in the July-September (Q3CY23) quarter, led by stable volume growth and strong pricing growth.

The company, which follows a January-December financial year, is due to announce its Q3 results on October 19.

The biscuit-to-confectionary company’s result expectations diverge from industry peers, which cut prices in a period of easing commodity costs.

The FMCG company is likely to clock a 26 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in net profit, at Rs 833 crore, in Q3CY23, estimated analysts.

Broad-based growth across cities

According to the average of three brokerage estimates, a broad-based growth across cities is expected to drive the company’s revenue by 12.5 percent YoY to Rs 5,136 crore in Q3CY23. Sequentially, it is likely to rise 11 percent.

Though rising price trends were seen in coffee and dairy products, analysts say that the softening prices of edible oils and packaging, coupled with no discounts, will enable the company to override any pressure on margins.

Nestle India’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margin is estimated to expand up to 235 basis points on-year to 24.5 percent in Q3CY23, helped by deflation in commodity costs, price hikes, and operating leverage.

Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities believe that Nestle India will outperform peers. “Nestle India is well-placed to outperform the FMCG pack by a healthy margin and stable volume growth. The company will clock 4 percent volume growth and 7 percent value growth in Q3CY24,” they added.

Long-term growth levers

Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher said that the long-term growth drivers remain intact for the FMCG company.

“The long-term growth levers include growth across channels like out-of-home consumption (OOH), and e-commerce, sustained expansion in rural reach, huge scope for growth in coffee, and innovation across core segments. We estimate 13 percent earnings per share (EPS) compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13 percent over CY23E-CY25E for Nestle India,” the brokerage firm added, sharing an ‘accumulate’ rating on the counter, with a target price of Rs 23,585 per share.

That said, the company is set to receive only 20 percent revenue contribution from rural India (the lowest among stable companies), said analysts.

This muted demand trend, however, is set to improve gradually as inflation moderates, liquidity pressures ease, and healthy sowing trends emerge.

Some of the important factors that investors should watch out for are the commentary on recovery in trade channels and rural demand, new product pipeline, and demand trends in the packaged food segments."

Nestle SA said the total amount of food and drink sold globally has been falling since the start of the year, highlighting the challenge for the sector.

“People are consuming less, or they’re eating less or they’re wasting less or they’re eating more out of home,” outgoing Chief Financial Officer Francois-Xavier Roger said during a Bernstein conference Thursday. “It’s difficult to know. I don’t think it will last.”

Large consumer goods companies have grown sales through sharp price rises in recent quarters, and many have suffered declines in volumes. Nestle hasn’t raised prices much since the start of April, Roger said.

US consumers have been resilient, but the end of Covid-era subsidies and savings is starting to impact consumption, the CFO said. Nestle’s China business hasn’t recovered as quickly as the company had expected.

Roger said Nestle is more optimistic about Europe, having been worried about that market’s access to energy last winter.

Nestle shares fell as much as 1% Thursday. They have dropped about 4% this year.

The Swiss company makes food ranging from KitKats to Maggi stock cubes and has been reshaping its food portfolio as it’s still optimistic that consumers will want to eat healthier products. Nestle announced a target on Thursday to boost sales of its more nutritious products by as much as 25 billion Swiss francs ($27 billion) by 2030. That would be about 50% more than the 2022 level.

Roger, 61, who will be replaced by Anna Manz, the finance boss of the London Stock Exchange Group, is confident he is leaving Nestle in good shape as he takes his next “exciting” step in his career, which is yet to be disclosed.

He said Nestle continues to look at deals but most of those the company is assessing aren’t “must-haves.” The food maker could make small acquisitions that would boost earnings growth, he said.

Nestle will probably revisit its share buyback program next year, the CFO also said. The company can finance paying 7 billion francs in dividends and 3 billion francs on repurchasing shares each year, he added.

Asked about Nestle’s stake in L’Oreal SA, Roger said keeping the holding just above 20% allows the food company to include the French cosmetic maker’s earnings in its figures and that going below that threshold would hit earnings per share."

FMCG companies in India are betting on smaller pack sizes and low price points as they chase double-digit growth in rural markets.

“We have expanded our product basket in the rural market by way of newer Low Unit Price (LUP) or affordable packs across categories to feed these markets and push demand growth,” said Mohit Malhotra, CEO, Dabur India.

The company has stepped up investments to tap into the resurgence of rural demand, increasing the company’s reach to over 100,000 villages.

“We have also invested in consumer activations in rural India to better reach out to consumers in the hinterland, giving them an opportunity to touch, feel and experience our products,” Malhotra added.

Nestlé India, on the other hand, is re-launching its flagship Maggi noodles at the Rs 10 price point, targeting smaller towns and villages to regain market share and fend off competitors in the packaged consumer goods segment.

This repositioned Rs 10 pack, at 40gm, targets ""Rurban"" regions across 15 states, while continuing at the same price in parts of Punjab and Uttarakhand. Prices like Rs 5 and Rs 10 have a bigger recall and are convenient for transactions, making them appealing for affordable consumer goods like food and shampoos. Maggi Masala noodles also come in Rs 7 (32gm) and Rs 14 (70gm) variants.

Nestle and other FMCG companies continue to tweak their rural strategy to capture a bigger share of this growing market.

Dabur India has also initiated Project Yoddha, which focuses on penetrating small villages nationwide and identifying local entrepreneurs. Through this initiative, the company aims to establish brand ambassadors in each village but also offer consistent income opportunities to the rural community.

The rural promise

A Euromonitor insight published on September 11 noted that despite rising urbanisation and expansion of metro and non-metro cities, by 2040, rural areas will house half of all Indian families, in contrast to the global trend where only a third of households will be in rural settings.

Rural consumers often prioritise spending on necessities and tend to choose value packs to make the most of their budgets. The physical landscape and ease of access to products also significantly influence their buying decisions, the report added. Hence, for businesses aiming to prosper and widen their reach in India, a strategy centred on affordability, value, and robust distribution networks catering to the rural market is crucial.

LPUs driving growth

According to NIQ August data for India, driven by unit growth in urban, rural, modern, and traditional sectors, consumption has experienced double-digit growth, predominantly fuelled by smaller pack sizes. Although there's been a rise in the average pack size, it's still negative in most markets, excluding urban ones. It's crucial for brands now to offer the appropriate product assortment and pack sizes, the report added.

Analysts say that many companies are focusing on low price points (LPUs) to boost sales of these affordable units. “Rural markets are largely driven by LPUs and low price point stock keeping units (SKUs),” said Ajay Thakur, an analyst at Anand Rathi Institutional Equities.

Digital penetration in rural markets

Analysts noted that digital penetration in rural markets has seen a significant surge, driven by affordable smartphones and expanding internet infrastructure. This growth is transforming how rural consumers access information, products, and services, opening new avenues for businesses and empowering communities with digital tools and resources.

Rural consumers are shifting towards seeking value rather than just focusing on price. Digital access in rural areas is now on par with or even exceeds TV accessibility, a Proctor & Gamble (P&G) spokesperson said. “This change presents fresh opportunities for advertisers and simultaneously educates consumers about their available choices, further driving their aspirations.”

For P&G, the primary emphasis has been on enhancing direct distribution in rural areas, the spokesperson said, adding, “By integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning with the insights into local consumer patterns, we ensure our products reach the appropriate stores with the ideal mix.”

Outlook for rural demand

According to data for August by NIQ, a consumer intelligence firm, both rural and urban markets in India are witnessing growth. While the rural market's growth is somewhat uneven, it saw a 4 percent increase from the previous year. The urban market maintained its upward trend, with growth jumping from 5.3 percent in Q1 2023 to 10.2 percent in Q2, the report added.

Demand trends in both urban and rural India are showing signs of improvement, said Malhotra. “While rural India has been a key driver of growth a few years back, we have seen rural demand lagging urban demand for some quarters now. While rural is still behind urban, the gap is narrowing significantly,” he added.

The expectation is that, following the festival season, rural markets will draw level with urban ones, although they aren't projected to surpass them at the moment, said Thakur."

Looking at the first upcoming clean, Covid-free Diwali after 2019, Nestle India Chairman and MD Suresh Narayanan feels that Nestle India will “do better than last year”.

In conversation with CNBC TV18, he hopes to be lucky enough to hit double digits, with the only dampener in the equation being food inflation, although witnessing premiumisation in Nestle products at the same time.

Shedding light on packaged foods and beverages, Narayanan says that it constitutes just $100 billion out of the total $800 billion food segment. “Focussing on penetration-led volume growth, it would take us easily a decade or two. So improving on the same will provide good returns by the company,"" he says, adding that the category is expanding as Nestlé’s resonance is going up even in smaller towns.

Lastly, Narayanan says that the quest for acquisition is definitely there with the company, though there is no desperate need for the same to accelerate growth, as Nestle has “enough on its plate” to make the core categories deliver growth.

In August this year, in a press briefing, Narayanan said that looking at margins amidst high food raw material prices, 2023 has been better than 2022 from a commodity inflation perspective. The inflation in 2019, 2020, and 2021 combined was less than that of 2022, whereas, 2023, wheat, rice, packaging materials and fuel have remained stable. He states that coffee, as well as the milk process, are a cause for concern because the cost of production has increased for the latter. “Margins would continue to cause some pain, although serious concerns have been mitigated when compared to the previous year,” says the MD.

In the June quarter, Nestle India witnessed an uptick in consumer demand in the rural economy. But that's partly because it has been expanding its rural exposure. Currently, the rural segment comprises about one-fifth of sales. Moreover, the FMCG major launched 10 new products in the first half of 2023

In an exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18 in July, Narayanan said tier-two or tier-six towns are adopting to company's brands and are seeing three broad trends in the market, ""One is a strong trend towards premiumisation of brands. So, consumers are trending up in terms of certain categories, brands, and certain preferences.""

Nestle has witnessed double-digit growth in 21 out of 26 quarters, In the same almost 15 out of the 26 quarters have been quarters of double-digit profit growth. Founded in 2011, Nestle Health Science sells health-focused and nutrition products."

Food inflation is still a cause of concern despite measures taken by the government to check overall price rise and the movement of commodity prices needs to be closely watched for a long-term impact, Nestle India Chairman & Managing Director Suresh Narayanan said on Thursday. Going by publicly available information, now it is reasonably clear that with a 30 per cent deficit in the monsoon, Kharif crops might get impacted, even if the sowing is good, said Narayanan in a media roundtable here.

With this El Nino impact not fully played out, we still have to watch for the spectre of food inflation, he said. ""There will be pressure in terms of food inflation. Headline inflation will get mitigated because of various steps that the government will take but food inflation is still a cause for concern,"" Narayanan said.

However, he also added, ""Immediately put, I would not say that something alarmist is happening in terms of commodity prices. But we would have to watch this space and see how it evolves, impact being really for 2024 rather than immediate impact we will have."" On increased milk prices, Narayanan said it has a few structural issues as well.

""We talked about the post-Covid impact on the milch herd and then we had the lumpy skin disease and various other things, but that still has to be played out and plus the cost of production has gone up sharply. There has been a 30-40 per cent increase in the cost of feed,"" said Narayanan adding ""We do not expect the former to be able to absorb all of them"".

Milk will still be seesawing. There will be some relief during flush and then some escalation during the lean season, said Narayanan. ""But the other commodities, a lot will depend on how the Kharif and the Rabi crops come out. But still, there is a little bit of uncertainty there,"" he said.

Over the rural demand, Narayanan said even though it sounds speculative, if the rural sector gets badly impacted due to rains, then demand from those markets will have an impact. Nestle India, the makers of popular Maggi instant noodles, Kitkat chocolates and Nescafe, is expanding its rural exposure with relevant offering and currently gets one-fifth of sales from far-flung markets.

""Even though my play is relatively lower at about 20 odd per cent (in rural) it is fairly significant, he said adding At the moment, things are looking stable. In the last June quarter, Nestle had witnessed an uptick in consumer demand in the rural economy. In the last June quarter, Nestle had witnessed an uptick in consumer demand in the rural economy.

But if the thing gets dramatically Southwards in terms of impact, then they could be an impact. But today, I would put it in the realm of crystal gazing. One really has not fully absorbed the impact of shortfall in the monsoon so far because one is expecting that there will be some uptick in September but one does not know. That happens, and then we are back into the sunshine once again. ""The other trends such as premiumization and stronger demand in the smaller categories of towns from tier II to tier 6, continue. Nothing has happened there One should not keep crying wolf at the same time one should be cognizant that we still have not fully unbound the full monsoon cycle,"" he added."

European consumer-goods giants ranging from Nestle SA to Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and Diageo Plc are stepping up their response to activist threats by cutting costs, shedding underperforming brands and returning cash to investors. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg

Nestle SA Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider said said sales growth this year should be at the high end of its forecast range as the world’s biggest food company plans to return to volume-led growth.

Sales should rise 7.5% to 8% this year on an organic basis, Schneider told reporters, implying they may beat the consensus, which is 7.6%. First-half revenue gained more than analysts expected as Nestle pushed prices of Purina pet food and KitKat chocolate bars higher.

Like many consumer goods companies, the Swiss maker of Nespresso and Perrier has been increasing revenue through price rises in recent quarters even as volumes falter. With commodity price inflation on a downward trajectory, companies are looking at how they can claw back market share from private-label products and encourage consumers to spend, even as budgets remain tight.

A measure of volume was negative for a fourth consecutive quarter as shoppers balked at higher prices and bought fewer branded products. Schneider said he’s confident that volume and the mix of products sold should improve in the rest of the year as Nestle boosts marketing spending.

The company is also struggling with capacity constraints in the US that are particularly affecting products such as Purina petcare, coffee creamers and Perrier bottled water.

Gross margin, a measure of profitability, should widen in the second half after a decline in the first six months of the year, Schneider said in the statement.

Schneider said he expects to finish the strategic review for Palforzia, a peanut-allergy medicine, in the second half. Nestle is considering several options, and had originally expected to complete the process in the first half. Bloomberg reported earlier this month Nestle is considering selling the business to Swiss health-care group Stallergenes Greer, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Schneider acquired the maker of Palforzia for $2.6 billion in 2020, making one of his biggest moves into health since taking over in 2017. However, Nestle wrote down the bulk of its value earlier this year after the business underperformed.

Previously the low end of Nestle’s sales growth forecast was 6%."

Tomatoes are currently selling at Rs 220 per kilo in Delhi, up from Rs 30 per kilo just over a month ago. While high inflation around monsoons is a common phenomenon, the hike in prices this time has been unusual. The sky-high prices are forcing FMCG firms and restaurants to work around the humble tomato.

Global fast food chain McDonald's dropped tomatoes in north and east India about two weeks back. It cited supply shortages and quality concerns, after prices of the vegetable soared to record highs.

“Despite our best efforts, we are not able to get adequate quantities of tomatoes which pass our stringent quality checks. Hence, for the time being, we are forced to serve you products without tomatoes,” a statement by the fast food giant read.

A Reuters report published on July 22, 2023, said that a Subway outlet at Delhi airport had announced the ""Temporary Unavailability of Tomatoes"" in a sign, and added that the restaurant could not get enough supplies that passed its quality checks.

Meanwhile, restaurant owners have been able to find a way out, either by passing on the price rise to customers or by removing this luxury berry from their recipes, and substituting it with other vegetables or tomato puree.

``We have had to drop fresh tomatoes from our recipes, and are using tomato puree instead for our curries, pastas, etc.,” the owner of a prominent chain of cafes in Delhi told Moneycontrol.

“We have completely dropped tomatoes from our preparations and are substituting it with onions. We are using deggi mirch (chilli) to add colour to the food. There’s a slight difference in taste, but we have no option. The price of a kilo of tomato is what we charge per dish,” said Pandit Om, the owner of a dhaba Noida’s sector 76.

FMCG companies such as Dabur are reporting a surge in demand for tomato puree, a company spokesperson told Moneycontrol.

Brands generally take various steps to not run into losses or lose customers due to the steep hike, FMCG sector analysts from the Boston Consulting Group and Deloitte pointed out. These measures include, but are not limited to:

Reducing the size of small packets

“Products such as tomato sauces, which require a large amount of fresh tomatoes, are the ones that feel the effect of such a spike in prices. Brands generally de-gram for ‘magic price points’ — e.g., Rs. 10 packs — that help buyers stay within budget,” Namit Puri, MD and Senior Partner, Boston Consulting Group, told Moneycontrol.

Eliminating discounts

Big brands generally run promos or discounts on large packages, say 1 kg, especially in emerging channels. But once prices rise, they pull back these promos and sell the products at the MRP, Puri explained.

That way, brands manage to pass on the price hike to consumers without raising prices at their end.

Imports of tomato concentrate

Tomato concentrate is basically tomato pulp which can be stored for a much longer duration than fresh tomatoes. According to Anand Ramanathan, Partner and Consumer Industry Leader, Deloitte India, FMCG companies extensively use this to keep their supplies flowing.

“Tomatoes are an internationally traded commodity. India generally imports tomato concentrates from Thailand, which continues to sell it at normal prices,” Ramanathan said. Tomatoes are grown throughout the year in tropical areas, and it is only for a month or so that its price rises, he added.

Production ramp up

Experts said that food companies such as Dabur, Kissan, Nestle, Veeba, etc, that use tomatoes ramp up production once prices start rising, and halt manufacturing when costs become unviable. The products are sold till the stocks run out, and production is resumed once prices stabilise.

Price drop in Aug-Sept?

``There is a usual, cyclical drop in supplies due to heavy rains in the regions where tomatoes are grown. This often results in a spike in the retail price of fresh tomatoes and other vegetables,’’ Nestle told Moneycontrol in a written statement. However, this is believed to be a short-term phenomenon, which should correct in Aug-September as the monsoon abates, the statement added.

Sanjay Gupta, MD and CEO, National Commodities Management Services Limited (NCML), concurred that tomato prices could begin stabilising towards the end of August or early September with the arrival of fresh produce from Nashik, Narayangaon, and Aurangabad in Maharashtra.

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are expected to report moderate revenue growth in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. This is due in part to companies’ cutting prices and in part, to lower rural demand.

Nuvama Wealth expects a 5 percent growth in revenue and 15 percent in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBIDTA) for companies under its coverage.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 12 percent revenue growth for ITC, 10.2 percent for Britannia, 7 percent for Dabur and 9.1 percent for Hindustan Unilever (HUL). “We expect Nestle to lead the pack on revenue growth and Britannia or Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. on earnings growth (off a low base),” Kotak Institutional Equities says. Analysts expect Marico Ltd. to have a weaker growth.

In terms of performance, Britannia, Nestle, and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. are expected to do well, while Dabur, ITC, HUL and Bajaj Consumer are predicted to be in the middle tier, Nuvama Research says. Emami and Marico will likely struggle in the first quarter of FY24, the firm adds.

Nuvama’s report says Britannia’s rural performance is expected to help despite an overall weakness for the company, as biscuits have remained more resilient than other segments. For Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. the India business (organic business) is expected to grow by 9.5 percent with a volume growth of 11 percent year-on-year due to negative pricing in soaps.

Nestle is expected to perform better due to strong demand for milk and Infant nutrition. The company’s rural demand is also strong due to expansion in distribution and resilience in the noodles category.

ITC is expected to have a consolidated revenue dip by 4.3 percent year-on-year due to a very high base in wheat in their agriculture business.

Hindustan Unilever’s ice-cream portfolio is expected to see the impact of unseasonal rains and weak summers. The tea business is expected to see a fall. Milk inflation also remains a challenge for the company.

Marico, in its quarterly update of Q1 FY24, says that anticipated pickup in rural demand remained elusive, dampening overall growth prospects. The company is expected to report a revenue dip of 2.3 percent year-on-year on the back of sharp price cuts in Saffola edible oil, Nuvama notes.

Margins and Volume growth

Revenues are expected to be moderate as companies pass on the benefit of lower raw material costs to customers, but margins are set to expand as price cuts in select segments will likely increase prices.

“Easing inflationary pressures would drive gross margin improvement, but ad spends are likely to go up. El Nino is a key risk for the entire sector, but government stimulus programmes in an election year are likely to mitigate the former’s potential fallout,” Nuvama Research says.

Most companies will report healthy EBITDA growth led by gross margin expansion (off a low base). The increase in gross margins is primarily caused by decreasing raw material costs.

The companies under Kotak Institutional Equities are expected to report a 16.9 percent EBIDTA growth. After reaching their highest point in the first half of FY23, the prices of raw materials have been gradually decreasing, although they are still higher than they were before the COVID pandemic.

“The FMCG sector seems well poised in 1HFY24 with a raw material cost tailwind. However, in 2HFY24 we expect revenue growth to be moderate as pricing benefits should fade and growth would have to be volume-led.” said BNP Paribas.

Discretionary

The larger players in the paints industry are expected to experience moderate volume growth, although on a very high base. Indigo Paints is expected to outperform with twice the industry's growth rate. Most paints and adhesives companies are likely to see strong margin expansion, as per Nuvama Research.

The Health & Immunity sector is expected to bounce back and show decent growth after a few quarters of disappointing performances. However, the summer portfolio, which includes beverages, cooling hair oils, ice cream, and talcum powder, is likely to be weak due to unexpected rainfall, the research firm notes.

Demand for Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) continues to be soft but steady due to inflationary pressures. In this segment, Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 7 percent revenue growth led by 4 percent same store sales decline for Jubilant FoodWorks which would imply a marginal deceleration in the growth trajectory."

The Q4 earnings reports of Indian FMCG majors reveal divergent trends in consumer spending. In this regard, broking firm Jefferies in its recently released analysis of management comments of 40 major Indian consumer companies and disclosure of their individual demand figures has noticed mixed trends across segments.

According to the report authored by Vivek Maheshwari, Jithin John and Kunal Shah, while the premium consumer segment comprising premium apparels, jewellery and paints reported double-digit growth, most of the other mass oriented companies reported weak to moderate demand trends.

“Recovery seems to be underway across mass customer segments and low-tier geographies, but a rebound may take time, and would likely be visible during 2HFY24,” the authors further observed. While the individual management commentaries differed in their reasoning for tepid growth, they were unanimous in observing that although decline in inflation levels had considerably brought down input costs, it hadn’t necessarily helped pick up consumer demand to the expected levels.

This has been particularly noted in the management commentaries of Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) majors like Jubilant Foodworks, the operator of popular pizza chain Domino’s and Devyani International Foods which operates popular fast food brands like Pizza Hut and KFC. The former two along with popular dining chain Barbeque Nation have reported Q4 demand in red but expect to tide over the situation by the end of the second half of the first quarter in FY24.

Interestingly, while Pizza selling majors have seen a slump on various fronts such as declining Same Store Sales Growth (SSSG) due to aggressive store addition policy and reduced margins, other QSR majors popular for burgers such as the Burger King operator Restaurant Brands Asia (RBA) and Westlife Foodworld, operator of McDonald’s for western and southern India have disclosed having received strong demand in Q4FY23 and are confident of being in green in the coming quarters of FY24.

The Jefferies report also notes that while aggressive store additions may not have worked in favour of QSRs, pursual of the same has turned out to be a major growth driver for multi-category retail majors like DMart and Reliance Retail. The latter in particular has reported a strong 66 percent growth year-on-year (YoY), driven by grocery sales through its outlets like Reliance Smart Point while the outcome for DMart has been a mix owing to weak demand for mass apparels and other Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) which constitute a major chunk of its inventory.

In the context of multi-category retail, it is also worthwhile to note that barring Dabur and Emami which are in red, for most FMCG majors the demand continued to be moderate. Authors point out that most of the staples producers like Nestle, Varun Beverages and Tata Consumer Products Limited's brands like Tata Tea were acquiescent of the fact that the net demand was being driven by increasing consumption in rural areas. However, the report also notes that the response from the rural consumer base hasn’t been the same for mass footwear brands like Relaxo and Campus which have reported demand contraction in this geography.

Contrary to the conditions faced by mass oriented brands, demand for premium consumer goods manufacturers and brands remained relatively stable. Among the apparels segment, while overall demand for the commodities of Page Industries (Indian manufacturer of American brand Jockey), Aditya Birla Fashion and V-Mart remained in red, wedding apparel brand Manyavar’s owner Vedant Fashion along with fashion retail major Shoppers Stop and GoColours registered strong growth in FY23Q4.

In the jewellery segment, Tata’s premium watch maker and owner of jewellery brand Tanishq along with south Indian major Kalyan Jewellers reported high growth, with the latter having reported 18 percent revenue growth YoY driven by strong demand coming from the non-south. Similarly, riding on the strong 48% surge in housing sales and enhanced government spending on infrastructure, all major paint and adhesive companies reported revenue growth in green with Asian Paints reporting 13% growth YoY along with a strong demand driven 16% volume growth.

The management commentaries in ressonance with the observation of several analysts also observed that the demand and subsequent revenue growth forecast continues to be vulnerable to external factors. The Jefferies report in this regard observed that sustained easing out of inflation for keeping the input costs in check along with climatic factors like El Nino could play an important role in deciding the growth trajectory of the FMCG segment in coming quarters.

Nestle SA and Unilever Plc are appointing new chief financial officers, underscoring a changing of the guard at consumer-goods companies as inflation pressures the industry.

Nestle said Anna Manz, the finance boss of the London Stock Exchange Group, will take over from Francois-Xavier Roger when she is released from her current role.

Unilever’s veteran CFO Graeme Pitkethly plans to retire by the end of May next year. He will be working with a new chief executive starting in July as Royal FrieslandCampina’s Hein Schumacher takes over from Alan Jope.

Others in the industry like Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc and Carlsberg A/S are also hiring new bosses. The changes come as the industry faces an existential challenge from a cost-of-living crisis that’s forcing shoppers to tighten their belts and trade down to unbranded products.

The incoming managers will need to stem the erosion of market share without spending too much on advertising or new products, threatening profitability.

Roger and Pitkethly took on their CFO roles just months apart in 2015. During their tenures, the consumer-goods makers both doubled shareholders’ money, when including reinvested dividends.

Roger, 61, helped steer Nestle during a period of impressive growth even as the pandemic caused supply shortages, disruption and uneven demand in recent years.

‘Effective Partnership’

“We are disappointed to see Roger go, as he has built, to our eyes, an effective partnership with Nestle CEO Mark Schneider,” a Jefferies analyst wrote in a note.

Roger helped manage more than 100 deals, including the sale of Nestle’s dermatology business, the purchase of licenses to sell coffee products under the Starbucks brand and the divestment of part of the company’s stake in L’Oreal SA.

The last years of Pitkethly’s 21-year stint at Unilever have been more chaotic. To rebuff a takeover by Kraft Heinz in 2017, the company committed to a margin improvement, aggressively cutting costs and harming its brands. Then it failed to unify its corporate structure in 2018, and last year Unilever made a doomed and much-criticized attempt to buy the consumer-health arm of UK drugmaker GSK Plc.

Despite investor frustration, much of Unilever’s top brass has remained the same, so a broader overhaul is expected after Schumacher starts as CEO."

Essar Group firm GreenLine Logistics on Friday said it has deployed its LNG-powered trucks for transportation of Nestle's Maggi noodles.

This, a company statement said, is in line with Nestle India's sustainability goals as it looks to reduce the carbon footprint of its logistics operations.

""GreenLine has custom created the first-of-its-kind 46 feet long containers, which will be deployed for transporting Maggi noodles from Nestle's factory at Sanand, Gujarat to Bhiwandi, Maharashtra,"" it said.

Its LNG-powered fleet significantly reduces toxic emissions compared to diesel - carbon dioxide by up to 30 per cent, sulphur oxides by up to 100 per cent, nitrogen oxides by up to 59 per cent, carbon monoxide by up to 70 per cent and particulate matter (PM) by up to 91 per cent.

""In line with Nestle's carbon emissions reduction goals, the adoption of GreenLine's larger 55 tonne, 46 feet containers replaces smaller diesel 20-tonne vehicles, resulting in a substantial reduction in vehicle requirements,"" it said.

This, combined with the emissions reduction achieved by utilising LNG-powered containers, contributes to Nestle's green mission and enhances its ESG performance.

Commenting on the occasion, Anand Mimani, CEO, GreenLine, said, ""We are thrilled to announce our partnership with Nestle India in their journey to reduce emissions through our innovative green mobility solutions"".

""This collaboration marks a significant milestone, signalling the dawn of eco-friendly logistics for consumer goods companies in India. We eagerly anticipate the widespread adoption of our green mobility solutions by other industry leaders, empowering them to enhance their ESG performance, foster a cleaner environment, and pave the way for a sustainable future for generations to come."" Sanjay Khajuria, Director, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability, Nestle India, said, ""We are accelerating our sustainability initiatives. We are committed towards net zero emissions and sustainable logistics is a step in that direction.

""With this aim, we are deploying different modes of transportation using alternate fuel and using bigger vehicles to optimise vehicle capacity utilisation. We are hopeful that the association with GreenLine would help us to achieve our objectives."" Building on its achievements in green logistics for cement and steel, GreenLine is now introducing the superior capabilities of LNG-powered containers to revolutionise transportation in consumer goods, pharmaceuticals and express cargo sectors, the statement said."

The stock rose as much as 1.8% in Zurich.

Nestle SA’s sales growth unexpectedly accelerated, led by Purina and Friskies pet food, as the company raised prices at double-digit rates in most of its markets to keep up with soaring inflation.

Sales rose 9.3% on an organic basis in the first quarter, 2 percentage points faster than analysts’ estimates, making this one of Nestle’s biggest beats in years. The stock rose as much as 1.8% in Zurich.

The bulk of the revenue gain came from price increases of 10% or more across most of the world. China was the main exception, with pricing up only 3.9% there. A measure of volume slipped 0.5%.

The performance is a boon for Mark Schneider, who is contending with surging raw material costs in his seventh year as Nestle’s chief executive officer. The results show resilience among big food and consumer-staples companies in the face of the highest inflation in decades: consumers appear to be accepting higher prices without big declines in volume.

Procter & Gamble Co. and Coca-Cola Co. have also recently reported healthy sales growth.

Nestle’s strong start to the year “should alleviate the market’s concerns about demand elasticity and downtrading,” said Guillaume Delmas, an analyst at UBS Group AG.

Petcare revenue surged 16%. The next biggest gains were in confectionery and coffee.

Some Weakness

Despite very strong headline numbers, some units showed weakness: sales declined at Nespresso and the vitamins, supplements and minerals business. Capacity constraints also weighed on the water brand Perrier.

Pricing rose 9.8%, slowing slightly after peaking in the fourth quarter. Barclays analyst Warren Ackerman said the limited decline in volumes was encouraging after a weaker performance in the fourth quarter, with most divisions showing progress.

The expectation-beating growth came amid a portfolio shakeup that was expected to weigh down short-term revenue growth. Nestle has been eliminating underperforming product lines to improve profitability in the long term.

Schneider said last year that Nestle’s peanut allergy treatment Palforzia was a bad purchase and the company shuttered a Buitoni pizza factory in France after a bout of deadly E.coli infections. Last week, it announced a partial disposal of the European frozen pizza business.

Nestle maintained its forecasts for organic sales growth, margins and earnings this year."

Capital Foods produces condiments, food products, and ingredients under the Ching's Secret and Smith & Jones brands. The estimated value of the buyout is reportedly $1-1.25 billion.

Capital Foods' three major shareholders - Invus Group, General Atlantic, and Ajay Gupta - had late last year decided to sell the company.

Orkla owns MTR and Eastern Condiments' packaged foods business, while Kraft Heinz Co is the fifth-largest food and beverage company globally.

The ET sources did not reveal if the transaction would be entirely in cash or part stock. Some bidders have proposed buying up to 75 percent of the firm and making it public, the report noted.

Capital Foods was established in 1995 by Ajay Gupta, offering a variety of 'desi' Chinese and Italian food, including Ching's Secret instant Chinese noodles, soups, condiments, curry pastes, and frozen entrees, as well as the Smith & Jones range of ginger garlic paste, sauces, and baked beans.

The Swiss company has been discussing terms of a potential deal for Mumbai-based Capital Foods, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Any transaction would likely value the Indian firm at more than $1 billion, according to the people.

Capital Foods makes the Ching’s Secret brand of spicy noodles and fusion chutneys infused with so-called “desi Chinese” flavors. It also sells Smith & Jones cooking pastes and masala mixes.

El Niño, which occurs every three to six years, could derail the recovery in the rural FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) market, believes Nuvama Institutional Equities.

El Niño is the abnormal heating up of surface ocean waters that lead to changes in wind patterns and impacts weather across the world. The US government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has indicated the possibility of El Niño conditions developing this year.

In India, the last El Niño event of 2018 coincided with below-normal rainfall, notes Nuvama.

""Since then, India witnessed four good monsoons in succession. Hence, the probability of a fifth normal monsoon looks a bit challenging at this stage,"" it added.

Rural recovery underway?

Rural demand has been reeling under inflationary pressures in the post-pandemic era. This is evident from the declining volumes for FMCG companies.

According to a report released by data analytics firm NielsenIQ, in October-December, the FMCG industry grew 7.6 percent in terms of value but its volume growth declined 0.3 percent.

Of this, urban volumes grew by 1.6 percent year-on-year while rural volumes declined by 2.8 percent.

Things were slowly taking a turn as inflation started cooling off gradually from its peak in the later part of CY22. Hindustan Unilever said the company saw some green shoots in the rural market in Q3. Dabur's Mohit Malhotra also said that the demand slump had 'bottomed out'.

Now, the adverse weather conditions could be a roadblock to this recovery. Rainfall deficit is a major cause of the rural slowdown because it affects crop sowing and farm income.

In FY23, states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Jharkhand reported rainfall deficit that affected paddy sowing. ""Hence, the El Niño conditions remain a key monitorable that can hinder rural slowdown turnaround in India,"" believe Nuvama analysts Abneesh Roy and Rushabh Bhachawat.

Since rural India constitutes about 36 percent of the sales pie for a typical consumer company, FMCG fortunes could be in danger. In the present calendar year so far, Nifty FMCG has gained 3 percent, outperforming the Nifty50, which is down 1.9 percent.

Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are likely to see an improvement in their margins sequentially in the October-December quarter due to the liquidation of high-cost inventory and a fall in raw material prices. Revenue growth, however, is expected to be slower due to inflation affecting demand, mainly in rural areas, say analysts.

For the 19 consumer companies under its coverage, Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects 9.3 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in topline, 9.6 percent in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) and 8.1 percent in net profit.

The majority of the revenue growth will be driven via price hikes, which companies took in the past quarters to combat raw material inflation.

“With no clear signs of recovery in rural demand, we expect sales in staples to be driven by price increases and some premiumisation,” Motilal Oswal said.

According to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE), Nestle and Britannia will lead the staples pack with revenue growth of 19 percent YoY and 16 percent YoY. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is expected to post 14 percent YoY revenue growth.

“Foods will outperform personal care. Biscuits and noodles are expected to see robust momentum due to downtrading from street food,” stated Nuvama Institutional Equities.

Rural demand still sluggish

Rural demand did not improve at all in Q3, note analysts. Dabur India in its Q3 business update highlighted that the pressure on rural demand was further aggravated by the late onset of winter in north India.

Marico’s Q3 business update was also downbeat. The Parachute oilmaker said its consolidated revenue will grow in the low single-digit on a YoY basis due to a muted recovery in rural demand amid elevated inflation.

“General inflation and rainfall deficit in populous states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal and Jharkhand remain the key challenges, which have affected rural disposable income,” according to analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities.

Margins and volume growth

The good news for FMCG companies is set to come on the margin front. Gross and operating margins will see sequential improvement as raw material prices have cooled off significantly from their peak and high-cost inventory has been liquidated. However, analysts believe that increased ad spends can keep margin improvement in check.

“The major benefits of benign raw material prices will be witnessed in Q4FY23 onwards,” as per a note from Philip Capital.

Meanwhile, volume growth is expected to be subdued. Kotak analysts expect 4 percent underlying volume growth from HUL, 4 percent from Britannia and 2 percent from Godrej Consumer. In October, HUL cuts soaps prices across India due to a fall in palm oil prices, and as a result, volume trajectory is likely to improve in soaps, believe experts.

Discretionary demand dwindles

The picture looks grim for discretionary companies as the industry saw a demand slowdown in Q3 across paints, jewellery, apparel and QSR (quick service restaurants).

“Paint volumes remained muted in October due to a high base and rains, which affected festive demand, but November and December marked good recovery,” notes Nuvama Institutional Equities.

KIE estimates Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac’s revenue to decline YoY by 1 percent and 5 percent respectively. Berger Paints and Indigo Paints may clock 7 percent and 8 percent revenue growth, respectively.

“Varun Beverages and Westlife Development should report a good print, whereas Jubilant Foodworks, Devyani International and United Spirits should report a weak quarter,” the report added.

Westlife Development’s average daily sales are expected to be resilient, partly aided by a 2 percent price hike taken in October while Varun Beverages is set to outperform on the back of market share gains in under-penetrated areas with its energy drink Sting.

A consumer in Delhi now pays at least Rs. 8 more for a litre of packaged milk compared to the beginning of 2022 because of several price hikes by prominent milk brands Mother Dairy and Amul.

And while the smallest pack of Parle G biscuits still costs Rs 5, the weight of ingredients in the pack has been reduced over time to account for increasing input costs. Atta, or wheat flour, is now costlier by about 20% and the ubiquitous detergent brand Surf Excel has also increased 8-10% in price.

India’s Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) makers confronted twin challenges in 2022: subdued rural demand and inflationary woes. This meant that a bulk of the rural consumers resorted to downtrading -- buying less quantity or cheaper brands -- in some categories.

The Russia-Ukraine war led to an all-round spike in raw material costs and consumers have had to shell out more for almost all FMCG products as companies passed on a bulk of the price pressure.

Rural rules FMCG

Why is rural demand a key determinant of the fortunes of FMCG companies? Well, according to a recent presentation by Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), only about one in three Indian consumers is classified as urban, though the per capita FMCG consumption of the urban consumer is thrice ($82) that of the rural consumer ($27).

So, while the premium ends of the market lie in large cities, the FMCG volume game is still played in the hinterland. And since per-capita FMCG consumption in rural markets is way behind urban markets, rural markets are where a lot of the future opportunities lie.

So the steep increase in input costs -- fodder price rise led to pressure on milk producers, atta price hikes impacted biscuits and so on- forced the hand of FMCG companies.

Price hikes may have improved the toplines but also led to consumer downtrading, specially in personal and home care categories.

According to Crisil Ratings, the annual turnover of the FMCG industry is Rs 4.7 lakh crore. Food and beverages account for half of this and these categories are together expected to grow at a faster clip of 8-10% in FY23, compared to the personal care and home care segments where combined growth is likely to be 6-8%.

Overall, the FMCG topline is expected to grow 7-9% this fiscal year compared to with ~8.5% in the last, primarily driven by price hikes. But volume growth may be negligible at just 1-2% compared with 2.5% in the last fiscal year.

Crisil said that in FY24, however, growth of the FMCG sector would be driven by volumes as softening inflation would catalyse rural demand and urban demand will likely remain steady.

It is obvious then that the inflation print is the key factor impacting the industry’s fortunes in the remaining part of this fiscal as well as the next.

“The operating margin will see a 100-150 basis points moderation to 18-19% this fiscal on higher input costs (primarily wheat, milk, maize, rice, crude derivatives) and rise in selling and marketing expenses, despite price hikes undertaken by FMCG players over the last 4-5 quarters. However, softening in price of some raw materials, such as edible oil and sugar, will support profitability levels in the second half of the current fiscal. Next fiscal, operating margins should improve by 50-70 bps, considering better volume driven growth and coverage of costs, almost reaching pre-pandemic levels of ~20%,” Crisil said.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Inflation hurts

Unlike Crisil and other forecasters, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been more cautious in its inflation forecast. A statement after the December Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting said the inflation trajectory going ahead would be shaped by both global and domestic factors.

“In the case of food, while vegetable prices are likely to see seasonal winter correction, prices of cereals and spices may stay elevated in the near-term on supply concerns. High feed costs could also keep inflation elevated in respect of milk.”

The RBI’s latest inflation forecast pegs it at 6.7 percent in 2022-23, with Q3 at 6.6 percent and Q4 at 5.9 percent and risks evenly balanced. This would likely keep FMCG companies concerned over input costs, retail prices elevated and rural demand muted for now.

Varun Berry, the Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Britannia Industries, said in post-results analyst call last month that wheat flour prices have jumped by 25%, industrial fuel was almost 40% and palm oil 10% more expensive year-on-year.

And the Chief Executive Officer of HUL, Sanjiv Mehta, had said after the Q2 results of his company that the FMCG market continued to remain “challenging” and volume growth continued to decline in the period, particularly in rural markets.

The company had also said that a slight decrease in the price of a key input material - vegetable oil - was expected in the December quarter. But a host of other inputs including milk and cereals remain elevated.

On the positive side, HUL cited the improved urban job market to say that rural migration and non-farm income will increase as a consequence and thus help with rural demand. Also, normal monsoons, extension of the foodgrain subsidy scheme by the Centre till the end of calendar 2022 and the government’s committed capex investment were expected to improve rural market sentiment.

Overall, companies such as Nestle that have lower dependence on the rural consumer have performed better than those which have a large chunk of the business in the hinterland. And HUL has been leading the market in premiumisation by driving its product portfolio towards premium products in the urban markets.

Budget expectations

The growth trajectory of the FMCG industry is closely linked with trends in consumption demand. When consumers have more money in their hands, discretionary spending increases as do sales of FMCG products.

In its pre-Budget expectations, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has already asked the finance ministry to lower income tax rates to help revive consumption demand.

“The government should contemplate a reduction in the rates of personal income tax in its next push for reform as this would increase disposable incomes and revive the demand cycle,"" CII president Sanjiv Bajaj said.

The industry is expecting the inflationary trends, which continue to plague key inputs, to gradually subside. Another demand is an increase in government spending on rural infrastructure to strengthen rural demand by increasing incomes.

The PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry has also pushed for an increase in consumption-led demand through a hike in per capita disposable income. This, the Chamber has said, can be achieved by increasing the tax rebate benefits for consumption expenditure and encouraging the consumer to spend more on long-term consumer durables or real assets, such as a shop or a second house."

A recent fizzle in the hype surrounding plant protein consumption will give way to a more sustainable growth trajectory that could see the segment account for 30% or 40% of the global protein market, according to a top Nestle SA executive.

Like the initial boom in craft beer, many investors piled into the faux meat market based on overly optimistic expectations of consumer uptake, Chief Technology Officer Stefan Palzer said in an interview Monday.

“When craft beer came on the market, everybody wanted to have it,” Palzer said. “Then there was a dip in demand and then it slowly grew back over many years to a significant business. I think that’s what we will also observe here.”

Plant protein makers that benefitted from a greater emphasis on health in the early stages of the pandemic have struggled as inflation pushes consumers to less expensive options, including the animal meat they hoped to replace. Once an investor darling, Beyond Meat Inc. has lost more than 80% of its value in the past year as discounting products in the US and abroad hurts profitability. And some fast-food chains have pulled back from faux meat offerings after lackluster demand.

While the market may have been disappointed by plant protein sales of late, Nestle is still seeing “quite good” performance in the segment, said Palzer, who leads Nestle’s research and development. He’s preparing for steady consumption growth in the years ahead by building the plant protein portion of his global R&D team to 10%, or 300 people.

The Vevey, Switzerland-based firm will continue to develop meat replacements, but also has turned to products that use both animal and non-animal proteins -- such as an ambient mix that can be added to eggs to boost volume and affordability, or including plant ingredients in dairy protein drinks.

“We believe in the potential,” he said. “But the potential is beyond the pure alternative ingredient. It’s to use plant proteins to innovate in many parts of our portfolio.”

Peers including Hormel Foods Corp. already have been experimenting with meat-vegetable blends to appeal to the so-called flexitarian crowd that’s looking to cut back on animal proteins. Drive-in restaurant chain Sonic Corp. sold a mushroom-beef blended burger in the past that it touted as a healthier option.

While food science and technology remains a centralized pursuit for Nestle, innovation is decentralized, Palzer said. He spoke from Santiago, Chile, where the company held a ribbon-cutting event for a new center to develop foods for the requirements of consumers in the region.

He also sees plenty of plant protein potential in Latin America where meat consumption remains high. Motivations for turning to animal substitutes vary region by region. For example, in the UK and Germany, animal welfare is a big driver while in Latin America it’s more health and then sustainability, he said.

In the US, McDonald’s Corp.’s faux meat burger made by Beyond Meat hasn’t gone any further than just a limited test. Meanwhile, the chain has expanded the plant-protein burger across all of the UK and Ireland. Palzer said it’s inevitable that plant-based goes mainstream.

“There’s no way around that because we cannot continue with the same amount of meat and fish and chicken like we consume today,” he said. “So plant-based has to go mainstream simply cause there’s not enough animal protein.”"

Tirupati's world famous Lord Venkateswara temple's net worth of over Rs 2.5 lakh crore (about $30 billion) is more than the market capitalisation of IT services firm Wipro, food and beverage company Nestle and state-owned oil giants ONGC and IOC.

Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, keeper of the temple dedicated to Tirupati's presiding deity, for the first time since its founding in 1933 declared its net worth.

Its assets include 10.25 tonnes of gold deposits in banks, 2.5 tonnes of gold jewellery, about Rs 16,000 crore of deposits in banks, and 960 properties across India. All these total to over Rs 2.5 lakh crore. At current trading price, the networth of Tirupati temple is more than several blue-chip Indian firms, according to stock exchange data.

Bengaluru-based Wipro had a market cap of Rs 2.14 lakh crore at close of trading on Friday, while UltraTech Cement had a market value of Rs 1.99 lakh crore.

Swiss multinational food and drink major Nestle's India unit, with a market cap of Rs 1.96 lakh crore, too was valued below it.

State-owned oil behemoths Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) too were valued less than the temple trust and so was power giant NTPC Ltd, auto makers Mahindra and Mahindra and Tata Motors, world's largest coal producer Coal India Ltd, mining conglomerate Vedanta, real estate firm DLF and several others.

Only about two dozen companies have market valuation larger than the temple trust's networth. These include billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (Rs 17.53 lakh crore), Tata Consultancy Services (Rs 11.76 lakh crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 8.34 lakh crore), Infosys (Rs 6.37 lakh crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 6.31 lakh crore), Hindustan Unilever Ltd (Rs 5.92 lakh crore), State Bank of India (Rs 5.29 lakh crore), Bharti Airtel (Rs 4.54 lakh crore) and ITC (Rs 4.38 lakh crore).

Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) is growing richer and richer as the cash and gold offerings made by devotees at the hill temple continue to rise and fixed deposits in banks are also generating more income in view of increase in interest rates, a temple official said.

The assets owned by TTD include land parcels, buildings, cash and gold deposits in the banks, given as offerings to the temple by devotees.

Assigning a value to priceless antique jewellery and properties including cottages and guest houses on the seven hills to provide amenities to devotees could be misleading and hence does not form part of the estimated general asset value, temple officials said.

The sprawling seven hills are held sacred by devotees and are revered as the abode of Lord Venkateswara. In its about Rs 3,100 crore annual budget for 2022-23 presented in February, the TTD has projected over Rs 668 crore as income in the form of interests from cash deposits in banks. Also, Rs 1,000 crore income was predicted in the form of cash offerings alone — by about 2.5 crore devotees — in the hundi of the hill temple.

FMCG and packaged food products major Nestlé India has hopped onto the direct-to-consumer (D2C) bandwagon with the launch of its e-commerce platform MyNestlé, where consumers can buy all Nestle products. The company announced the launch along with its quarterly earnings for the third quarter ended September. Nestle India follows January to December financial year.

“To serve our valued consumers when and where it matters, I am delighted to announce the launch of our first ever D2C platform – www.mynestle.in,” Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director of Nestlé India, said in a press statement.

The company plans to offer curated product bundles, personalised gifting, subscriptions and discounts on its platform. Consumers can also try gourmet recipes on the platform and get free nutrition counselling.

Initially, MyNestlé will be launched in Delhi NCR and will expand to other parts of the country.

With this announcement, Nestlé India joins the ranks of Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Marico, Emami etc, who have also launched their D2C platforms in the Indian market.

FMCG majors have stepped up their D2C game with the emergence of several new-age companies such as Mamaearth, Plum Goodness,

Licious, who have reached a significant scale in recent times by reaching out to consumers directly through e-commerce instead of through traditional means that deployed such as distributors and retailers. Besides, launching D2C platforms the companies are also launching products specifically developed for their D2C channels or even online-only brands. Players such as Dabur, Marico, Emami and Tata Consumer Products are launching products exclusively for their D2C platforms and marketplaces as they compete with digital-first brands. Dabur India, for instance, aims to clock Rs 100 crore in sales from its digital-native brands in FY23.

The launch of D2C platform is expected to give Nestle India better sales from e-commerce as a channel, which currently contributes about 7 percent of its domestic sales.

“Launch of D2C platform – www.mynestle.in will further accelerate digital sales contribution over the medium term,” said Amnish Aggarwal – head of research, Prabhudas Lilladher.

Nestle India reported a net profit of Rs 668 crore in the September quarter (Q3), a year-on-year (YoY) jump of 8.3 percent as compared to Rs 617 crore reported in the year-ago period.

The company’s total sales for the period increased 18.3 percent and stood at Rs 4,591 crore in Q3 as compared to Rs 3,882 crore registered last year. Sequentially, the company’s net profit jumped almost 30 percent as compared to Rs 515 crore reported in Q2, while revenue climbed 14 percent to 4,036 crore in the June quarter.

The company’s performance has received thumbs up from analysts. “Strong revenue growth with good beat on revenues; And highest sales growth in the last five years,” Edelweiss said in a note.

Nestle India has been battling inflation in several commodities for more than a year now which has impacted its growth. The company, however, it witnessed a softening in prices of key raw materials such as edible oils and packaging materials.

“However, fresh milk, fuels, grains and green coffee costs are expected to remain firm with a continued increase in demand and volatility,” the company added."

Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) makers are expected to report strong revenue growth in the quarter ended September 2022, thanks to price hikes in the previous two quarters to offset input cost inflation.

For the 19 consumer companies under Motilal Oswal’s coverage, 16.7 percent growth is expected in revenue, 13.6 percent in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) and 12.9 percent in net profit.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects 17 percent revenue growth for Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), 15 percent for Britannia, 13 percent for Nestle and 12 percent for ITC’s FMCG business.

“Food and beverages categories should fare better than some home and personal care categories. We expect ITC, HUL, Britannia and Nestle to lead the pack,” Kotak Institutional Equities said.

Margins and volume growth

Revenue will expand, but margins will continue to be under pressure because of high-cost inventory. Analysts expect lower spot prices of raw materials to aid margins from the next quarter onwards.

“The prices of key commodities such as crude and palm oil have eased in the recent weeks, but they are unlikely to benefit margins in Q2FY23 as the decline came in only towards the end of the quarter,” Motilal Oswal said.

The full benefit of lower raw material prices is likely to come about only in H2FY23. Companies’ commentary on raw material prices, rural recovery and outlook for H2FY23, as the festive season kicks in, will be key to watch, Axis Securities said.

Volumes growth in most categories will be dented because of product weight reduction, high consumer inflation and a sustained slowdown in rural demand.

“Rural demand, which is 40-50 percent of industry demand, is reeling under burden of higher agri-input inflation. There are clear signs of downtrading across brands – hyperinflation in day-to-day essentials weighed on consumer disposable income,” Philip Capital said.

In its Q2FY23 update, Marico said its India business will record low single-digit volume growth. Dabur, too, warned of weak demand trends across categories in the quarter gone by.

Kotak Institutional Equities has pegged 4-8.5 percent domestic revenue growth with subdued volumes for Dabur, Godrej Consumer and Colgate.

For Marico, the securities firm expects 1.8 percent year-on-year domestic revenue growth on the back of low single-digit volume growth.

Paints and discretionary category

Asian Paints is expected to lead the paints pack with high double-digit growth. Axis Securities expects Asian Paints to deliver 32 percent year-on-year growth, driven by a combination of 12-13 percent volume growth, price hikes, market share gain, and expansion of the dealer network.

IDBI Capital expects Asian Paints’ revenue to grow 24 percent year-on-year. With prices of key raw materials such as crude and titanium dioxide decreasing by 16-17 percent on a sequential basis, the company’s EBITDA margin is expected to grow 500 basis points YoY to 18 percent. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

When it comes to QSRs (Quick Service Restaurants), Philip Capital expects 12 percent price-led same store sales growth for Jubilant Foodworks on account of 12-14 percent price hikes taken in the past year.

“Westlife Development shall see much better performance (+25 percent) versus Jubilant Foodworks due to higher share of dine-in (as consumers are facing fatigue towards delivery models)” the note added.

For United Spirits, Nuvama Research (earlier known as Edelweiss) expects revenue growth of 13.1 percent YoY while profits and margins will take a hit as higher priced inventory will show up in this quarter.

Meanwhile, United Breweries’ revenue growth is expected to slow sequentially due to the peak summer season in Q1FY23. High barley and glass bottle prices might impact gross margins of the company.

FMCG major Nestle India on Friday said it is in talks with workers across its three plants, who are planning not to work on Sunday in protest over the lack of paid leave for organising union activities.

The workers of Nestle at its three plants - Nanjangud in Karnataka, Bicholim in Goa and Tahliwal in Himachal Pradesh - plan not to work on Sunday, protesting over not getting paid leave for organising union activities.

Nestle India, which manufactures a range of products ranging from coffee, noodles and confectionary products in these plants, said the move will not have any business impact on the company.

""As a responsible people-centric organisation, we are in conversation with our colleagues and do not insist they work on specified days that they are not inclined towards,"" said a Nestle India spokesperson.

""Further, we do not anticipate any business impact, even if there is no production in a few factories on one day,"" he added. India is among the top ten global markets of Nestle SA, a Swiss multinational food and beverages conglomerate.

Nestle India presently operates nine factories employing roughly 6,000 people. Its revenue in 2021 stood at Rs 14,709.41 crore. Its revenue in 2021 stood at Rs 14,709.41 crore."

Recently, Nestlé CEO Mark Schneider had announced plans to invest Rs 5,000 crore in India in three-and-a-half years by 2025. The move will help the company to accelerate its core business in the country and leverage new opportunities for growth.

Nestle, the world’s largest food company, plans to invest Rs 5,000 crore in India by 2025, CEO Mark Schneider said during his week-long visit to the country, which is Nestle’s 10th largest market globally. The fresh investments will help the company accelerate its core business in the country and leverage new opportunities for growth in well-established and emerging categories, he said.

This was Schneider's second visit to the country since joining the Switzerland-headquartered food and beverages major in 2017 from the healthcare group Fresenius where he was chief executive. It is also his first global market visit since the Covid-19 pandemic hit, and marks the first meeting of the board of directors in an international market, signifying the importance the company attaches to India in the global scheme of things, Schneider said during an exclusive conversation with Storyboard18 on CNBC-TV18.

Schneider also said the investment would be on capital expenditure, expanding and enhancing Nestle India's portfolio of brands, acquisitions in emerging segments, and setting up new plants.

Today, 99 percent of what Nestle sells in India is made in India and the company also has a global R&D centre in the country.

Nestle owns over 2,000 brands globally and is the maker of iconic household brands such KitKat chocolates and Nescafe instant coffee and, of course, Maggi, an Indian pantry staple and one of the country’s most loved brands.

Maggi, the clear market leader in the instant noodles market, made a dramatic turnaround when it came back from the brink after allegations of contaminants in 2015. Packs were pulled off shelves and over 22,000 tonnes of Maggi had to be destroyed at an estimated cost of Rs 500 crore. In the years that followed, the company doubled down on efforts to re-establish trust in the brand and saw Maggi return to its market-leading position. But there’s increasing competition from well-entrenched as well as new players and the challenge of constantly evolving tastes and preferences.

The company has also been dialling up its sustainability efforts to address the many challenges it faces today, with a focus on the new bottom line —people, planet, profits.

In India, initiatives that fall in Nestle’s ‘commitment to society’ are in the areas of nutrition awareness with the Nestlé Healthy Kids programme (started in 2009) and Project Jagriti to encourage good nutrition and feeding practices and encourage uptake of public health services. In rural development, Nestle runs the Dairy Development (1961) and the Nescafé Plan (2012) programmes to improve the quality and sustainability of coffee sourcing and production. Other initiatives include the Spice Plan, Project Vriddhi and Project Hilldaari to drive better management of waste collection and segregation.

Nestle has been present in India for over a century and Schneider shared that in the last 60 years, since Nestle began manufacturing in India, it has invested over Rs 8,000 crore in its operations here.

“In 1961, we started our first manufacturing site and so in that whole time period it has been Rs 8,000 crore and now in the next three years, it will be Rs 5,000 crore,” Schneider said during a media roundtable. The investment, subject to board approval, is for accelerating the core business and ramping up capex, development works and brand building with sustainability as one of the core pivots."

Global food & beverage conglomerate Nestle SA plans to invest Rs 5,000 crore in India in the next three-and-a-half years by 2025, its CEO Mark Schneider said on Friday.

The move will help the company to accelerate its core business in the country and leverage new opportunities for growth.

The investment would be on capex (capital expenditure), setting up new plants, acquisitions and expansion of the product portfolio of the company. Nestle, which currently operates 9 plants across India is also looking at new locations to set up manufacturing capacity.

The investment, which would be subject to clearances and approvals, will also help in creating more job opportunities in the domestic market.

Sharing the investment plans of the Indian market, which is among Nestle's top ten markets, Schneider in a media round table said the Swiss food & beverage company has an investment plan of Rs 5,000 crore through 2025.

""When you look into the investment in this country and the investment plan through 2025, we are talking about Rs 5,000 crore and that compares to Rs 8,000 crore over the last 60 years when we started manufacturing in this country,"" he said.

Nestle is present in India for over 110 years but started its manufacturing activity in the early 1960s, he added. ""In 1961, we started our first manufacturing site and so in that whole time period it has been Rs 8,000 crore and now in the next three years, it will be Rs 5,000 crore,"" he said.

This investment is not only for accelerating and ramping up cpaex alone but also goes into a whole lot of development works, brand building and meaningful contributions on the ground, Schneider said.

Nestl India Chairman and Managing Director Suresh Narayanan said that accelerating the core business of the company would be a focus area.

""It is definitely a highly accelerated plan that we are looking at. This has three pivots"" such as continuing the strong momentum of growths that the company has in last 22 quarters,"" he said adding. The second part is do it sustainably, and the Nestle had took ""significant steps"" in that direction.

""And the third part is really to leverage new opportunities for growth, whether it is plant-based proteins, healthy ageing, healthy snacking, leveraging some of the Indian grains into products for the company,"" Narayanan said.

Schneider further said Nestle India's business has maintained ""consistency at very high levels"" for 22 quarters, which is ""outstanding"" and ""truly stunning"" and is a complete willingness for ""open chequebook"" support every step of the way.

The investment would be on organic growth such as capex and putting money into facilities such as existing factories or research centres. However, Schneider also added: ""So on top of that, if we see interesting opportunities for M&A, we will be very happy to explore those.""

When asked about the investment and capacities details segment-wise, Narayanan said: ""It is going to be secular across categories. It is not going to be in particular categories."" However, he also added, ""probably we are looking at new locations for factories as well. It could be a big part of the ambition that has as a company.""

Nestle India presently operates nine factories employing roughly 6,000 people. ""The ambition to invest Rs 5,000 crore would have been a significant increase in the direct and indirect employment as well,"" he well

Nestle India's revenue in 2021 stood at Rs 14,709.41 crore. It had last invested around Rs 700 crore to open its plant at Sanand in Gujarat to manufacture a range of popular instant noodles Maggi."

Unlike the classic KitKat, the vegan version uses a rice-based formula as a milk substitute. It’s one of the biggest launches of a vegan alternative of a major confectionery brand and took two years to develop.

“We have four in 10 consumers saying they are interested to move to a more plant-based diet,” said Corinne Gabler, Nestle’s head of confectionery for Europe in an interview. “It could be a significant market in the confectionery area.”

The vegan chocolate market is already currently valued at $533 million and expected to more than double to $1.4 billion in 10 years time.

Vegan Foray

Small labels started the foray into alternatives to milk chocolate and now big brands are following. Swiss chocolatier Lindt & Spruengli AG, known for its Easter bunnies wrapped in golden foil, sells oat milk-based bars under its Hello label. Mars has introduced vegan versions of its Bounty, Topic and Galaxy bars and Mondelez International Inc.’s Cadbury released the Plant Bar last year, presented as a vegan edition of Dairy Milk.

There have been some setbacks, however, and Britain’s largest grocer Tesco Plc recently stopped stocking Mars Inc.’s vegan version of its Galaxy chocolate bars in a dispute over labelling.

New product launches can also flop, as Nestle discovered when its Milkybar Wowsomes, with 30% less sugar, was pulled from the shelves following weak demand.

Nestle has high hopes for KitKat V, however, and is starting with 300 tons with room to produce more, said Gabler. This compares to tens of thousands of tons annually for KitKat mainstream products in Europe. Although developed in York, England -- the heart of Nestle’s chocolate innovation hub -- mainstream production will take place in Hamburg, Germany, where there’s greater capacity.

Retail Pricing

In less welcome news during the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades, KitKat V is likely to cost more than the regular version. This is because it’s more expensive to produce, due to pricier ingredients and the need for stringent cleaning measures on production lines, Nestle said.

During Nestle’s trial last year, KitKat V was sold at around $1.06 in some shops, costlier than the non-vegan version, according to Gabler. The company is looking at efficiencies to make the gap as small as possible, she said.

Nestle sampled many non-dairy alternatives including oats, soy and almond before settling on its rice-based formula for the right creamy texture that’s familiar to fans of the non-vegan version, according to Louise Barrett, head of the Nestle Confectionery Product Technology Center in York.

“It’s super challenging,” said Barrett. “Our R&D experts have worked to make it as close as possible.”"

Pet food and pet care products have taken off in India with a spike in pet ownership and FMCG players are out to grab a share of this market, which is estimated to triple to $1.26 billion four years from now.

Emami, a skin and healthcare products maker with brands such as BoroPlus, Navratna, and Zandu Balm, acquired a 30 percent stake in pet-care startup Cannis Lupus Services India in July. The company sells pet food branded Fur Ball Story.

Nestle India bought Purina Petcare India for Rs 125 crore. Globally, Purina Petcare is owned by Nestle and was launched in India as a separate entity in 2017.

Pet food brands such as Pedigree, Royal Canin, Whiskas, and Drools have been around in the Indian market for years. Mars Petcare, which makes Pedigree, Royal Canin, and Whiskas products, and the Indian Broiler Group, the maker of Drools, together command over 60 percent of India’s pet food market.

Purina Petcare has a 3 percent share in the segment. Stylam Sydney, Cargill, Farmina (Russo Mangimi Group), Bharat International Pet Foods, Agro Food Industries, and Himalaya Drug Co. are the other companies in the market.

Why has the pet food segment caught the interest of FMCG companies now?

Pandemic, millennials, and pet ownership

Pet ownership is on the rise in India. According to industry estimates, there are about 30 million pets in the country today and the number is growing at about 11 percent, which means an addition of about 3 million pets every year.

Experts said although 90 percent of the households feed their pets home-cooked meals, the trend has been changing as owners become aware and seek better pet care products and food.

The pet food industry in India, said Anil Razdan, executive vice president of PGA Labs, a business research firm, is currently valued at about $405 million, or Rs 3,199 crore, and is expected to reach $1.26 billion, or Rs 9,978 crore, by 2026. The market growth has accelerated, especially during the pandemic.

“In 2021, the pet food market grew at a CAGR of 19 percent from 2016. The Covid-19-related restrictions and lockdown resulted in many people adopting pets, which, coupled with rising per capita disposable income and increasing nuclear families, resulted in the growth of the pet food industry,” said Razdan.

Several other trends are leading to the growth of the pet food industry.

While dogs remain the favourite pets, consumers are also adopting cats. Dog food accounts for 85 percent of the pet food market, although the cat food segment is growing the fastest, at about 20 percent CAGR, according to industry estimates.

Pet ownership has risen in the smaller cities and towns, too.

“Pet ownership is growing across town classes. Owning pets is no longer just a metropolitan phenomenon but a phenomenon across the country,” Suresh Narayanan, chairman of Nestle India, said at a press conference recently.

Ease of access due to online shopping is helping pet food companies extend their reach to the smaller towns and expand the market. About 73 percent of pet owners purchase food online, and about 27 buy them from pet specialty stores, according to industry estimates.

There’s also a growing trend of premiumisation in the segment as customers seek better quality and even organic food for their pets. The trend is found among new-age pet owners and millennials, who account for 30 percent of pet ownership in India, experts said.

FMCG adjacencies

Experts said there are other reasons for FMCG companies to hop on to the pet food bandwagon, most notably the similarities between the two categories.

“The frequency of purchase for pet foods is as high as FMCG products and the industry is known to drive frequency of consumption through better formats. Hence, it makes sense for them to leverage this opportunity,” said Anand Ramanathan, a partner at Deloitte India.

Besides, companies operating in staple food categories such as maize can also tap their supply chain to manufacture some of these products, he added.

The high margins of these products – 15-25 percent as per estimates – also make them a lucrative proposition for FMCG companies.

Nevertheless, the FMCG segment has several challenges.

“The cost of acquisition is high in the segment due to low awareness of the high nutritional value of manufactured pet foods,” said Ramanathan.

An ambiguous regulatory environment and quality standards, isolated government policies focusing on livestock and animal feed (cattle feed) specifically, higher taxation on pet food and the absence of a single nodal authority are other roadblocks in the segment."

Nestle India, as it battles inflation as well as a tepid demand scenario, is focussing on protecting growth instead of raising prices to maintain its profits margins, the company’s chairman and managing director Suresh Narayanan indicated while addressing investors during a virtual call on July 28.

“In 2018, if you look at the CAGR of commodity inflation, it was at 3 percent and 15 percent in 2022. There are two ways in which the company can tackle this. One is to take industry-led price increases and the other to control costs,” said Narayanan.

“However, the game of market share starts to work against you, when you take indiscriminate price increases to mitigate the situation,” he added.

Nestle India, hence, is working on balancing pricing, and margin expectation and at the same time also trying to retain the growth for the future, said the CMD and hence took price hikes in the range of 8.5 percent to mitigate the impact of 15 percent inflation.

Nestle India grew 16.8 percent in the quarter-gone-by, of this 8.9 percent was price-led and 7.9 percent volume-led.

“Volume is still growing extremely well. That is the bottom line. The day we start having sharp volume decline irrespective of the value growth, irrespective of the profit growth, we will have a system that is hollowed up and eaten from within,” said Narayanan.

The CMD also said that there have been early signs of softening in edible oil prices and packaging, however, he added that green coffee, wheat, fuel, and fresh milk prices, other key commodities for the company are expected to remain firm.

Nestle India reported a 4.31 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in its net profit for the June quarter (Q2) to Rs 515 crore as compared to Rs 539 crore reported in the year-ago period. The company’s revenue from sales during the quarter stood at Rs 4,006.86 crore, up 15.72 percent YoY, from Rs 3,462.35 crore registered last year in Q2. Nestle India follows a January to December financial year.

According to the company, it witnessed strong growth across the categories in the June quarter. The milk products and nutrition category witnessed double-digit growth across brands with Milkmaid leading the way, it said. The confectionery category led by KITKAT and Nestlé MUNCH performed with strong double-digit growth, while the beverages category turned in another double-digit growth across channels, it said. The foods category continued its strong double-digit streak of growth, with improved market share in Maggi Noodles, said Nestle India.

Brokerage firm Edelweiss said while the company delivered a good beat on sales, its results were a miss on margins. Nestle’s gross margin contracted by 304 basis points due to raw material inflation and its EBITDA margin fell by 295 basis points.

Nestle India has also announced the acquisition of pet food business Purina in India and its entry into this new segment. The company bought the pet care firm for Rs 123 crore."
"July 28, 2022 03:25 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/nestle-raises-growth-outlook-eyes-consumer-reaction-to-price-hikes-8906731.html,"Nestle warned on Thursday that price hikes could eventually weigh on sales volumes for the maker of Cheerios cereals, Kit Kat bars and Nescafe as it raised its full-year sales growth forecast to 7-8 percent and trimmed its margin guidance.

Cost inflation hurt the world’s biggest food group less than expected in the second quarter and price increases boosted first-half organic sales growth.

Consumer goods businesses are facing soaring costs for raw materials, energy and transportation, and though many consumers so far seem to accept the resulting price increases, delays in implementing them are squeezing companies’ margins.

""So far, the evidence we’ve seen about consumers trading down is very limited to certain categories and geographies,” Chief Executive Mark Schneider told a media call.

""But that doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen down the road, and that’s something that we need to watch in the second half.”

Nestle shares, down almost 8% this year, were 1.4% lower at 0817 GMT, lagging the European food sector index.

Nestle raised its full-year sales growth forecast, just like Rivals Reckitt Benckiser, Unilever and Danone earlier this week, after steep price increases helped all four companies beat second-quarter sales expectations.

Schneider said it was easier to raise prices for household products or cosmetics than for food, but pricing would catch up over time so margin pressure would be temporary.

Nestle, whose products range from pet food to gourmet coffee, said its underlying trading operating profit margin dropped to 16.9 percent in the first half of 2022 from 17.4 percent a year earlier. It now targets around 17.0% for the full year, the bottom of an earlier 17.0 percent-17.5 percent range.

Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said the new margin guidance was ""still a very strong margin, with a much smaller year-on-year margin decline than most of its European peers”.

Organic sales growth, which strips out currency swings and acquisitions, accelerated to 8.7 percent in the second quarter from 7.6 percent in the first three months, beating forecasts thanks to price increases of 7.7 percent and strong demand for Purina petcare products.

Sales of confectionery, notably KitKat chocolate bars, and coffee, including Nescafe and Starbucks brands, increased but consumers bought fewer premium Nespresso capsules in Europe.

Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy attributed the lower Nespresso volumes to tough comparables and ""unprecedented” price hikes. Kepler Cheuvreux’s Jon Cox said, ""High prices are bound to impact volume at some point, with under pressure consumers probably looking at cheaper alternatives in some cases."""

Nestle on Thursday raised its full-year sales growth forecast to 7-8% and just slightly lowered its margin guidance after cost inflation hurt less than expected and price increases boosted organic sales growth in the first half of 2022.

Consumer goods firms are facing sky-rocketing input costs for raw materials, energy and transportation, and while many consumers so far seem to accept the ensuing price increases, delays in implementing them are squeezing companies' margins.

Peers Reckitt Benckiser, Unilever and Danone raised their full-year revenue forecasts this week after steep price hikes helped them beat second-quarter sales expectations.

At Nestle, the world's biggest food group, net profit hit by one-off items including higher impairments and taxes fell 11.7% to 5.2 billion Swiss francs ($5.42 billion), the maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Maggi soups said in a statement, missing an average 5.815 billion Swiss francs in a company-compiled consensus https://www.nestle.com/investors/analysts-consensus.

The underlying trading operating profit margin declined to 16.9% in the first half of 2022, from 17.4% in the year-ago period, slightly higher than the expected 16.7%.

In the second quarter, underlying or 'organic' sales growth accelerated to 8.7%, from 7.6% in the first three months of the year, thanks notably to price increases of 7.7%, Nestle said.

First-half organic growth reached 8.1%, beating a forecast for 7.4% in the poll.

The company based in Vevey on Lake Geneva said it now expects organic sales growth of 7-8%, versus around 5% previously, and an underlying trading operating profit margin of around 17.0%, versus previous guidance for a margin between 17.0% and 17.5% this year."

With commodity prices peaking out, major FMGC players, including Parle Products, Godrej Consumer Products, and Dabur expect a recovery in demand in both rural and urban markets in the future aided by price stability.

Moreover, FMCG makers can look forward to better gross margins by the last month of Q2FY23 on a year-on-year basis, as there is a lag of around two months in their inventory coupled with forwarding contracts, experts say.

Prices of commodities have now peaked out and there has been a 15-20 percent decline from peak prices in most commodities, according to Parle Products Senior Category Head Mayank Shah.

''This has brought some respite to FMCG companies, whose margins were affected by high inflation. Since most companies stagger price hikes and take them in a phased manner, we will not see any further price hike or package weight reduction which was in the offing. Despite price hikes taken by FMCG companies, the total increase in input cost was not factored in,'' Shah told PTI.

While prices of commodities have seen a decline in the last few days, they are still very high compared to a similar period last year, he said.

''Hence at best we will see no further price hikes. The price stability will help in the recovery of the market, both urban and rural since inflation and price hikes were a major concern,'' Shah added.

Expressing similar views, Edelweiss Financial Services Executive Director Abneesh Roy said crude oil price is at a one-month low, and packaging cost, which is a significant raw material input for all FMCG companies, is linked to crude oil prices.

When asked about margin expansions, he said in ''Q2FY23 there would be some benefit, not major as there is a lag of 2-3 months given there will be inventory, and forward contracts. So a big expansion will happen in H2FY23.'' ''In Q2FY23, in the last month of September, we should start to see the benefit for companies like HUL, Britannia, Nestle, and GCPL as they use palm oil. For the rest of the companies, further crude oil price correction is important as that will benefit packaging cost,'' Roy added.

Besides, he said the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the US dollar also needs to be factored in as most of the raw material is imported.

Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL), the FMCG arm of Godrej Group, expects a recovery in consumption and gross margins in the upcoming quarter.

''With inflationary pressures abating and significant correction in palm oil derivatives and crude oil, which are some of our key raw materials, we expect a recovery in consumption and gross margins in the upcoming quarter,'' said GCPL in its quarterly updates for Q1FY23.

GCPL owns brands including Godrej No 1, Ezee, Good Knight, Cinthol, Hit, and Protekt.

Similarly, Marico, which has popular brands such as Saffola, Parachute, Kaya, and Hair & Care, said prices of key inputs such as copra remained soft during the quarter.

Moreover, edible and crude oil prices cooled to some extent towards the end of Q1FY23, but the company consumed higher cost inventory in this quarter.

''We expect operating margin to expand, leading to reasonable operating profit growth on a Y-O-Y basis. The effective tax rate (ETR) will be higher by 250-300 bps in FY23 due to the expiration of fiscal benefits in one of the manufacturing units. Therefore, net profit growth is expected to lag operating profit growth,'' said Marico in its update on the operating performance and demand trends witnessed during the quarter that ended June 2022.

The company maintains its aspiration of delivering sustainable and profitable volume-led growth over the medium term, enabled by the strengthening brand equity of its core franchises and scaling up new engines of growth, said Marico.

Another player, Dabur said it continues to target higher than industry growth on a medium to long-term perspective with ''stable margins'', although there are near-term inflationary pressures.

''Despite high inflation and near-term consumption pressure, the company will continue to invest behind power brands, innovation, distribution expansion and a strong back end which will help us drive long-term sustainable growth of the business,'' said the quarter updates from Dabur.

Last week, leading FMCG makers in the updates had said the domestic FMCG industry continued to be ''hit hard by inflation levels'' leading to successive price hikes as well as impacting volumes during the three months ended June."

FMCG companies across the board are feeling the pinch of inflationary trends. Nestle, the maker of major brands like Maggi and Nescafe, is no different. In an exclusive conversation with Storyboard18, Nestle India’s managing director and chairman, Suresh Narayanan, tells us how the company is sustaining all the momentum in consumption that came during the pandemic for flagship brands like Maggi and meeting customer expectations in challenging times. We dig into trends like D2C and healthy-aging, and how Nestle is expanding its health and wellness bandwidth as a company. Plus, Narayanan shares his leadership lessons during a crisis and he tells us why he is one of the most responsive chief executives on LinkedIn. Edited excerpts:

How has 2022 been for Nestle India so far? How are you sustaining all the momentum in consumption that came during the pandemic for flagship brands like Maggi?

One of the striking features of 2022 has really been unrelenting inflation on commodities that we are faced with. 9 or 10 of our top 13 commodities we procure as a company have crossed their ten-year high. The cumulative inflation in the last three years has essentially met or surpassed the inflation that we are facing today. So, really the commodity inflation is something that is here with us and that is something that we have to cope with.

On the other hand, I must say that the demand for our mainstream brands has been fairly robust. Most of our portfolio is doing well. But the one thing that we have to really combat in the short to medium term is commodity inflation. How do you deal with it in terms of efficiencies, in terms of effectiveness, and also in terms of pricing. So those are some of the concerns that one is combating at this point in time.

Also read: Why we've been craving Maggi during the pandemic

Maggi is now a four decade old brand, it’s an iconic brand, which had a dramatic turnaround when it came back from the brink after the lead crisis. How are you looking at unlocking the next level of growth for a brand like Maggi?

Maggi is really a classic example of a brand that has been mass customized even before the word has been fully digested by marketers. Everybody has an association with it. There’s a Suresh version of Maggi. There’s a Delshad version of Maggi. Everybody has their own version of Maggi.

Yes, it’s a brand that went through some very difficult times. But I’m glad to say that thanks to the consumers, stakeholders and employees of the company, the brand has come back very strongly and rose to greater heights during the pandemic.

Today, the brand’s ecosystem is much bigger than brand Maggi itself - the number of wheat farmers, factory workers, spices and packaging suppliers, and number of vendors who actually sell Maggi across the country, that number runs into hundreds of thousands if not millions. So the footprint of the brand is very big and it's really growing each day. It is going from strength to strength, the strength comes from three platforms.

Number one is innovation, and innovating constantly across variants. Number two is Maggi is now more digital than it ever was. In the last two years, the digital connection with our consumers, whether it is recipe searches, recipe provisions or the experiential part of Maggi and ensuring that consumers talk about Maggi, has become a very important aspect of the brand.

And the third is our sustainability initiatives. A number of initiatives are being put through. As a brand we have been plastic neutral for the last two years. Sustainable farming for spices, we work across five states with almost 2000 to 3000 farmers working on sustainable agricultural practices in growing spices, and also the traceability of spices. During the pandemic we began the Apna Food Business initiative to incentivize and to encourage women entrepreneurs, with training and seed capital.

So there are different initiatives around sustainability and the food business, and really trying to see how the ecosystem of Maggi can become stronger and even more robust.

What’s the strategy in terms of how you handle these challenges and meet consumer expectations when it comes to Maggi’s pricing?

It is definitely very challenging because you know Maggi is almost a common staple in many homes, across income status. That is something that we are very cognizant of. Typically, in a difficult situation as far as commodity inflation is concerned, there are two or three vectors that the company uses. The first one is because of the sheer scale of Maggi, there are economies of scale in terms of buying at the right time, stocking at the right time and really ensuring that you try and minimize the input cost impact that you start feeling from one period to the other.

Number two is we do have a cost efficiency program almost contributing to 1 to 2 percent of sales, we call it sharp savings, which is really operational savings, packaging savings and other related savings. For example, on Maggi, in the last two to three years, there’s been an almost 7 to 8 percent reduction in the amount of packing materials that have been used. So there are efficiency parameters that we work on in order to reduce the cost and only after one and two, which is really the economies of scale and the efficiencies and effectiveness are not fully satisfied do we touch pricing. So pricing is really only the third vector that we operationalize.

But as I told you, the scale of inflation has been rather stiff this year. I mean, 2019, 2020 and 2021 has been more than offset by the impact that we’re facing in 2022. Almost every single element of the value chain has had a substantive increase in costs. So we're trying to do our best to ensure that we mitigate as best as possible the impact that we’re facing. And yet, I’m afraid we've had to, with deep regret, pass on some of the price increase to consumers as well.

We’ve seen a huge influx of D2C brands in food. How are you seeing the D2C brand space play out and how is Nestlé growing its presence in D2C?

The D2C space is really becoming very interesting. Also very challenging because you have to find a differentiator for the consumer experience between buying on organized trade or ecommerce or the general trade versus buying on a D2C platform. So the degree of differentiation really has to be quite acute and quite sharp in order for it to work.

Secondly, D2C is becoming very attractive because consumers are now looking at brands as not just products to be consumed but they're also looking at it as a reflection of their own lifestyles. So whatever they are looking for in their lifestyles in terms of nutrition, health, wellness, advice, tips, etc, all of this engagement has been built into a D2C platform. As I speak to you, we are working on a platform and we will be making our foray into it. However, we just want to ensure that whatever experience we give it is robust and adequate enough to satisfy the most discerning consumers. Nestle would not like to put a half foot forward. We want to put a firm foot forward.

People are becoming more conscious about how they live, what they consume and what they eat. How is Nestle addressing the trend toward more healthier living? Because at the end of the day you are in the business of making snacks, beverages and confectionery.

There's nothing called good nutrition or bad nutrition. It's all about balanced nutrition. During the pandemic we saw two or three things come out very clearly. Number one is that consumers are looking for nutrition and immunity. Second is the preference for quality and the safety of a brand over any other parameters. But they are still seeking value and because of the economic consequences of the pandemic, there are segments of consumers whose budgets are being stressed. And therefore they're looking at better value offerings that companies can give. So, for us, the journey has been to improve the quality of the nutrition that we seek to offer, whether it is Maggi or milks and nutrition or in any other part of our portfolio, to make better, healthier and more relevant offerings.

We are looking at products in healthy snacking, whether it is grain based or protein based. The whole area of plant-based proteins is becoming an additional source. The question is one of adapting plant-based proteins into the Indian context and cuisines' relevance rather than just lifting concepts from the west.

We’re looking at entries into areas like Healthy Aging. As India grows more prosperous and as our population growth rates decline, we also are becoming more of an aging population. The 60-plus population is gradually creeping up in this country. And these are the people who also have the money in their pockets. They earned reasonably well and saved prudently, and now they're looking at products and offerings that can keep them healthy and happy as they grow older.

So these are a couple of areas that we certainly are looking at quite aggressively to develop some of these products and really expand the nutrition and wellness bandwidth of the company as we go forward.

How has your leadership style evolved, particularly given the life-changing global events of the past three years? What aspects do you dial up in tough times?

Having spent four decades in the trenches, there is an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage is that my leadership style is settled and it is not something that is going to be variable. The disadvantage is that it is prone to less change as one would expect of a leader perhaps 20 years younger.

What for me has been the central theme of this pandemic has been a phrase that I use reasonably often - In a crisis you don’t run a company, you serve a family. I honestly believe that a company is like a family. It's a family of employees, colleagues, partners, stakeholders and of people who have got some stake and some involvement in your business and the larger ecosystem.

In a crisis, you lead by example and you lead by managing yourself. So the biggest challenge is a capability to be able to manage yourself, your emotions, your uncertainties, your fears, because the fact of the matter is that people don't want to see a fearful leader. They don't want to see a leader who spins in his boots and is uncertain about whatever he or she has to do. So number one is managing yourself.

Number two is keeping your ego in check. This is not about you. It is not about how brave you are and what a super human being you are. What happens when you quell your ego is that you generally allow people to do the right things in a non intrusive way, in a non threatening manner in which they are able to contribute the best they can.

A leader has to be authentic and transparent. It is not for me to show my people that I am a superhero but I am as human and that I need to be able to not answer all the questions. I need to be transparent and ask the right questions. If you ask the right questions, you'll get the right answers, provided you're transparent and provided you are as vulnerable as you need to be in a crisis.

Fourth, compassion over competence in a crisis. There are very competent people. The world is full of very bright people. But at this stage nobody wants to see the cranial capabilities or the intellectual capabilities of the CEO. They want to see the compassion of the CEO. What happens to him when there is a death in the family of an employee? What happens to him when there is a serious illness around? How does he react when people and the community around him are suffering? Does he reach out, going beyond empathy and acting with compassion? Or is he only a person who's bothered about the top line, center line and the bottom line?

These are lessons in leadership. The leaders of the future have to be outstandingly good human beings. You can be competent, brilliant, qualified from the best institutions but if you don't have a heart that beats at the right speed for your people, you can't call yourself a leader.

Many CEOs today have become social media influencers. But you are one of the most responsive CEOs I’ve seen. Tell me what’s your approach to how you address and respond to your employees, colleagues, customers and consumers on platforms like LinkedIn?

I don't mean to boast but when we were young managers, each one of us had a dream of what we would like to be known for. One of the things that I had hoped to do as a more mature manager is to be able to positively influence as many people as I can.

I am not much of a social media person. LinkedIn is the only thing that I do and I do that reasonably regularly. One of the things that always kind of rankles me is that if I am a 23 year old and I'm writing to someone with a request and that person does not even have the courtesy to reply to me back, simply because he's sitting on a high horse of being the chairman of a company or the director of a company or whatever position he is. I think it is basic human courtesy and respect.

I genuinely feel extremely happy when young people achieve something in their lives because the only legacy that I will ever leave behind as a corporate leader is to have created leaders who are far better than me. Far more competent than me and far more capable of handling an environment that is increasingly going to be more turbulent, more difficult and more unpredictable.

So, in that context, I believe that I should find the time. And I most often do but sometimes I don't and my apologies for those who have not received my replies in time. But I really think that nurturing the young and giving them a few examples of what they could emulate in their lives, or what they could even consider as perspective in their lives, is important.

I can't give knowledge to them. I'm not a professor. I'm not a tech person. I'm not the kind of guy who has got a whole amount of specialist wisdom coming out. What I can share with them is the robustness of perspectives, and the introspection of a lifetime in order to offer them more hope, and probably some examples of what people could look at for themselves for the future.

Over 500 kg (1100 pounds) of cocaine have been found in a container of coffee bean bags for Nestle's Nespresso factory in Romont in western Switzerland, news agency Reuters reported on May 5. The seized substance was 80 percent pure and had an estimated street value of more than 50 million Swiss francs (Rs 390 crore).

According to the report, the shipment had arrived from Brazil. Police were informed on Monday night that labourers at the Nespresso plant found an unknown, unrecognisable while coloured substance at the Romont Factory when the bags of coffee that came from Brazil were being unloaded.

Analyses confirmed that the substance was cocaine. A search of five shipping containers delivered the same day by train allowed for the seizure of more than 500 kg of the drug.

The entire shipment was confiscated by the police for further investigation.

""The substance in question did not come into contact with any of our products or production equipment used to make our products,"" Nespresso said in an emailed statement. ""We want to reassure consumers that all our products are safe to consume,"" it added. Reportedly, the cocaine was probably destined for the European market.

Have you been unknowingly mispronouncing some of them for years? Here are 10 brand names, some high-end, some mass market, in no particular order, with my take on how to say them right. I’ll also throw in a titbit or two about each brand. Do note that this video is a collaboration between Storyboard18 and The English Nut. Keep watching and reading. It’ll be fun. I promise!

Hyundai pronounced ‘Hun-day’

It’s Hyundai, like Sunday. Remember the Super Bowl ad in which the South Korean car maker’s competitors were screaming out its name in anger because it won an award? The ad put the screaming in context with the line, ‘Win one little award and suddenly everyone gets your name right.’ The commercial ends with the mnemonic, ‘It’s Hyundai, like Sunday.’ Great way to tell the world you won an award and to get people to pronounce your name right.

Yves Saint Laurent pronounced ‘Eve Saan Lorawn’

‘Eves Saint Law-rent?’ No, mademoiselle. No, monsieur. C’est Yves Saint Laurent. The two n’s aren’t really pronounced. You just nasalise the preceding vowel sounds. ‘Saan Lorawn’. You see, Yves Saint Laurent was a Frenchman. He was also one of the foremost fashion designers of the 20th century. He started his own fashion house after being sacked by Dior—whom he sued and won. If you have trouble with the French pronunciation, you can say it the English way—Yves Saint Laurent. Or shorten it to its initials, YSL. But if you want to get it absolutely right, say ‘Eve Saan Lorawn’.

Amazon pronounced ‘Am-uh-zon’

This is an American multinational, so we go with the American pronunciation of the name. Amazon—where ‘zon’ rhymes with ‘don’. Now, before there was Amazon, the company, there was Amazon, the rainforest. And the mythical female warriors, the Amazons. Of course, the British pronunciation for the rainforest and the warriors is ‘Am-uh-zun’ and ‘Am-uh-zuns’. But when it comes to the company name, it’s best to stick to the American way—‘Am-uh-zon’.

Volkswagen pronounced ‘Folks-vaagen’

In English, it’s usually pronounced as ‘Volks-wagon’. But the original German pronunciation is ‘Folks-vaagen’, which means ‘people’s car.’ You know—folks, people. Same difference. This company, known for its iconic Beetle, was launched in 1937 to make cars that the German masses could afford. Hence the name.

Nestlé pronounced ‘Nes-lay’

I’ve seen old American ads where it’s pronounced Ness-lee. And, back in the day, I’ve heard British kids say ‘Nesslz’ chocolate. But given that it’s a Swiss multinational company named after its founder Henri Nestlé and his surname has an acute accent on the e at the end, I would pronounce it as Ness-lay. Henri Nestlé was born Heinrich Nestlé and was actually of German origin. Nestlé means ‘little nest’ in the German dialect he spoke—which is why the company logo features a little nest.

Givenchy pronounced ‘Zhee-vawn-shee’

Givenchy is a high-end French fashion and perfume house. It’s pronounced ‘Zhee-VAWN-shee’ not ‘Giv-en-chee’ or ‘Jiv-en-chee’. Founded in 1952 by French aristocrat and fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy. The v-e-n in the name is pronounced ‘vawn’. The n is not really articulated. The vowel sound before it is nasalised. ‘Vawn’. Givenchy achieved fame in the world of haute couture with his very first collection—which was lauded by Vogue.

‘Haute couture’ means high fashion in French. The h is silent and the t is soft in French—so it’s ‘oat’ couture, not ‘hot’ couture. Also, you don’t pronounce the last letters of most words as per French rules, but you do pronounce the penultimate ones. For haute couture that would be t and r respectively. The sound of the r in French is somewhere between the r and h of English. Or you could think of it as a softer version of the ‘kha’ sound in Urdu—like in ‘khair’ or ‘khabar’.

Now, you’re ready to indulge in haute couture by Givenchy.

Lamborghini pronounced ‘Lambor-GEE-nee’

I hear it being pronounced as Lam-BOR-ginee. But it’s Lambor-GEE-nee. It’s an Italian brand and that’s how Italians say it: ‘Lambor-GEE-nee’. It’s named after its founder, Ferruccio Lamborghini. Note that the stress is on the second-last syllable—‘GEE’. Lambor-GEE-nee. Of course, if you can afford a luxury sports car by Lamborghini, you can pronounce it any way you please!

Adobe pronounced ‘Uh-doe-bee’

It’s not ‘Ad-obe’, but ‘Uh-doe-bee’. The English word adobe refers to a brick of sun-dried earth and straw that is used to build houses in certain places. The word came into English from Arabic via Spanish. Of course, today Adobe is better known as the name of the American multinational computer software company that makes, among other things, the famous Adobe Photoshop software.

Ikea pronounced ‘I-KEE-ah’

I say ‘I-KEE-ah’. Everyone I know says ‘I-KEE-ah’. The Indian ads and the American ones say ‘I-KEE-ah’. But interestingly, the UK ads say ‘Ee-KAY-ah’, which is closer to the Swedish pronunciation. So if we want to say it the authentic Swedish way we can say ‘Ee-KAY-ah’. Or we can say it like the American and Indian ads: ‘I-KEE-ah’. I’m going to stick with ‘I-KEE-ah’—except when I’m in Scandinavia.

Zomato pronounced ‘Zo-mah-to’

‘You like potayto and I like potahto

You like tomayto and I like tomahto

Potayto, potahto, tomayto, tomahto.

Let’s call the whole thing off’

Remember the old song from the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical 'Shall We Dance?'

We might face a similar quandary with the brand name ‘Zo-mah-to’. Or is it Zo-may-to? Or Zo-mat-oh?

Well, Zomato is an Indian company and I’ve heard its Indian founders pronounce it as ‘Zo-mah-to’. So that’s the right pronunciation. We’ll let Fred and Ginger keep on arguing about tomayto and tomahto. But we’ll say ‘Zomahto’.

So we covered ten brand names. And how to say them right. I hope you enjoyed the video.

Indonesia's plan to ban palm oil exports will deal a blow to the world's top food and consumer products companies including Unilever, Procter & Gamble and Nestle.

Indonesia counts for more than half of the global supply of the edible oil, which is used in everything from cakes, chocolate, margarine and frying fats to cosmetics, soap, shampoo and cleaning products.

It is also key to Ferrero Rocher chocolates and Nutella spread, giving them a smooth texture and longer shelf life.

Here is a summary of how much palm oil companies use, based on the most up-to-date data available:

UNILEVER

Unilever said in 2016 that it used about 1 million tonnes of crude palm oil and its derivatives and about 0.5 million tonnes of crude palm kernel oil and its derivatives.

It said it was the largest user of physically certified palm oil in the consumer goods industry.

The company declined to give more up-to-date data.

NESTLE

In 2020, the maker of KitKat chocolate bars bought about 453,000 tonnes of palm oil and palm kernel oil, mostly from Indonesia and Malaysia, its website says.

It uses about 88 suppliers from more than 1,600 mills in 21 countries. It also buys from Latin America, Africa, and other parts of Asia.

PROCTOR & GAMBLE

The company used about 605,000 tonnes of palm oil and palm kernel oil, and their derivatives, in its 2020-2021 fiscal year, a company document showed. It is used in its fabric and home care categories and beauty products.

Its purchases account for about 0.8 percent of global palm oil production and it sells palm oil byproduct it cannot use. Some 70 percent of its palm oil is sourced from refineries in Malaysia and Indonesia.

MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL

The Oreo cookie maker said that it purchases large quantities of palm oil in a securities filing.

It accounts for 0.5 percent of palm oil consumption globally, according to its website.

DANONE:

Danone said it purchased a total of 71,000 tonnes of palm oil in 2018.

FERRERO:

The Italian maker of Nutella sourced 85 percent of its palm oil supplies from Malaysia and only nine percent from Indonesia in the first half of 2021, according to its website.

L'OREAL:

L'Oreal said in a 2018 report that it uses less than 370 tonnes of palm oil per year but it purchases derivatives of palm oil and kernel oil equivalent to 71,000 tonnes."

Saurabh Mukherjea, chief investment officer (CIO), Marcellus Investment Managers, spoke on concerns emerging around the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger, about the sharp fall in the shares of HDFC twins, underperformers Nestle & Asian Paints, and on margins coming down in the Q4 for the consumption companies.

Dismissing concerns around the growth outlook for HDFC Bank going forward, Saurabh Mukherjea, speaking in an interview with CNBC-TV18, did not slash the earnings growth estimates going forward, and said the stock will continue to give high premiums for investors in the long term.

On being asked over some concerns regarding the weakness in HDFC twins after the merger announcement, Mukherjea said HDFC Bank was an outperformer in the private banking space in the last five years.

The analyst believed the stock price movement is momentary and the superior asset quality will keep the returns intact for investors.

Outlining his reason for this outlook, he stated he was positive about HDFC Bank with a long-term view. Mukherjea further said HDFC Bank could deliver around 20 percent, from a long-term perspective.

Mukherjea, reacting to a question on HDFC Bank and HDFC stocks witnessing sell off recently in the run up to the merger, said, ""Last five years have been spectacular. They have just blazed away. 20 percent loan book compounding and 20 percent deposits compounding.”

He also believed no other bank remotely matches up to HDFC Bank.

The analyst said, "" No other bank in the private space has been able to compete with HDFC Bank on both sides of the balance sheet. On gross and net NPAs also, no other private sector bank is even close to HDFC Bank. If HDFC's 2 percent ROA is seen, it is difficult to see any other with 2 percent ROA. If we look at the performance of HDFC Bank in the last 15 years, it is in a completely different league. Even in the last 3 years, no other bank came close to such performance.""

On being questioned again over pre-provisioning operating profits of HDFC Bank slightly looking weaker, Mukherjea said, ""We have to back companies which have delivered through decades in a stellar fashion. So, we back such companies which give 20-25 percent returns on our clients' investments.""

Coming out in defence of the merger, Mukherjea said, ""The merger will bring two very profitable businesses together. We will see their ROEs exceed and growth reaching high.""

The market expert added, ""Currently, HDFC Bank's mortgage runs on HDFC, so HDFC Bank's growth is reduced. When HDFC Bank holds on to mortgages, it will accelerate.""

Since their merger announcement on April 4, shares of HDFC Bank and HDFC tanked close to 15 percent each.

HDFC Bank, the largest private sector lender in India, on April 16 reported a 23 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in standalone net profit at Rs 10,055.2 crore for the quarter ended March 2022 as bad loans provisions declined 29 percent, with further improvement in asset quality. But the lender’s operating performance showed spots of trouble. Operating profit growth was just 10.2 percent for the quarter and the net interest margin was at a record low.

The analyst stated the succession plan for HDFC Bank was taken care of, when asked whether the new leadership will continue to produce the kind of results it gave and if there is a reason to worry.

Dismissing such concerns, the market expert said, ""We have closely monitored the succession planning. Shashi was mentored and trained by the erstwhile CEO. The operating metrics from the time Sahshi took charge are stellar. They are growing at a fast pace. Delivery impeccable on asset quality and growth. I give 10/10 to Sahshi.""

Mukherjea is also extremely bullish on Nestle India and Asian Paints.

The expert termed both the stocks which are market-leading franchises have been compounding consistently, and added, slight margin pressures witnessed by Nestle India do not add any material value.

He said, ""Nestle's share price compounded around 25 percent in the last five years. Profits compounded to 22-23 percent. It is obviously a dominant player in its category. There is food cost pressure. It utterly dominates the category that is a compulsory purchase.""

Mukherjea, reacting to the performance of Asian Paints in the stock market, said margin pressures of the company should not be a concern for long-term investors.

""Whenever crude doubles over a two-year period, Asian Paints' operating gross margins are solid. This results in the share rallying. Share price of Asian Paints in the last 12 months compounded. It has gained rapidly in the last 4-5 years,"" said Mukherjea.

The expert noted rising raw material costs and inflation have acted as a dampener for both the business companies.

Nestle India on April 21 reported a 1.3 percent decline in its net profit to Rs 594.7 crore for the quarter ended March, which came in below Street expectations of Rs 625 crore. It registered a 10.2 percent growth in revenues from operations to Rs 4,002.14 crore.

""Cost of key raw and packaging materials are witnessing 10 year highs amid supply constraints. Costs continued to surge this quarter which has impacted profit from operations,"" said the FMCG major which owns brands such as Maggi, Nescafe and Kitkat.

Nestlé India said they continue to be wary about inflation in the short to medium term.

It added the cost outlook for key commodities like edible oils, coffee, wheat and fuel remains firm to bullish.

""Fresh milk costs are expected to remain firm with continued increase in demand and rise in feed costs to farmers,"" said Nestlé India.

The firm on April 21 reported a 1.3 percent decline in its net profit to Rs 594.7 crore for the quarter ended March, which came in below Street expectations of Rs 625 crore.

"April 15, 2022 02:17 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mondelez-nestle-pepsi-face-pressure-from-european-employees-over-russia-8364991.html,"Oreo-maker Mondelez, Nestle and PepsiCo face pushback from workers in Ukraine and eastern Europe angered by the companies' decisions to maintain some business in Russia, according to internal corporate communications reviewed by Reuters and interviews with six workers.

The emerging employee activism comes on top of Ukraine's repeated appeals to Western companies to go beyond current sanctions and cut all commercial ties with Russia, with the mayor of Kviv calling such payments to Moscow ""bloody money"".

To be sure, the employees speaking out, or even resigning in some cases, over the companies' response to Russia's invasion are mainly based in Ukraine, Poland or Eastern Europe and are a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of workers the food makers employ.

An internal memo seen by Reuters shows Nestle has seen an unspecified number of Ukraine employees quit and others bullied on social media for remaining with a company doing business with Russia.

Roughly 130 employees at Mondelez in the Baltics region encompassing Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia sent a petition in March to CEO Dirk Van de Put to stop all business in Russia, an action not previously reported.

One Ukraine employee of Mondelez interviewed by Reuters expressed shock and dismay that their company was still promoting ""The Batman"" Oreo cookies in Russia and offering chances to win up to 500,000 roubles ($6,000) on an Oreo website.

The website showed cinema tickets and hats being awarded as recently as Wednesday to winners whose phone numbers start with the Russian country code.

Another website promoting Milka chocolates offered Russian residents up to 20% cash back on purchases and prizes in a promotion that started March 15, three weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine.

""The Batman"" movie was pulled from release in Russia one week before it was scheduled to reach theatres.

Warner Bros Discovery Inc WBD.O, which owns the movie studio that made ""The Batman"", communicated the move to its partners, such as Mondelez, but had no influence over whether ""The Batman""-branded product is removed from shelves, a person familiar with the matter said.

Mondelez did not respond directly to questions about the ""The Batman"" Oreos or Milka promotions but said it has no advertising on air in Russia. The company said it would suspend advertising media spending March 9.

Consumer goods companies, including Unilever ULVR.L and P&G PG.N, have said they are continuing business in Russia because some of their items are necessities, like diapers or milk, that everyday Russians need. They also are supporting humanitarian efforts in Ukraine.

Nestle, PepsiCo and Mondelez, three of the world's biggest packaged food makers by market capitalization, have not disclosed which brands are still sold in Russia, or what they consider to be essential.

The Mondelez petition said workers ""strongly oppose"" the company's decision to remain in Russia, according to screenshots of an internal social media posting shared with Reuters by an employee. The employee declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

""Each Russian ruble paid to the state budget in the form of taxes and salaries (helps the) aggressor supply its army and kill even more Ukrainian people, among which there are children, women, elderly people,"" the employee petition states, according to the screenshots.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory and denies targeting civilians.

Mondelez European President Vinzenz Gruber responded to the post, saying that ""our culture (at Mondelez) includes everyone who shares our values and calls for peace,"" according to the screenshot.

""We stand by our colleagues and not by their governments/country decisions,"" Gruber wrote.

""We appreciate that our employees are speaking up and are sharing their voice on this heartbreaking and senseless war,"" Chicago-based Mondelez said in a statement. ""We have heard a range of different voices from colleagues around the world, and our leaders are in active dialogue with their teams as we manage day-to-day operations.""

'MENTALLY BROKEN'

In addition to 19 posts on internal corporate message boards, one worker at PepsiCo, two at Mondelez and three at Nestle separately told Reuters that they want to see their employers take a stronger stand against Russia.

""Our grandparents told us terrible stories"" about Russian actions in Poland during World War Two, said Patrycja Stas, 40, a manager at Pepsi in Warsaw. ""I see the same thing is repeating in Ukraine, and it is extremely depressing.""

Stas told Reuters she is leaving her job for reasons independent of the war but said that Pepsi's ongoing business in Russia showed her she made the right decision.

Although Pepsi suspended sales of soda in Russia, it continues to sell what it calls ""daily essentials,"" including snacks and dairy products. Pepsi declined to comment.

The company, which had more than 3,100 employees in Ukraine, is using its headquarters in Poland to offer shelter to those leaving Ukraine.

The head of Nestle's European business, Marco Settembri, in an internal email seen by Reuters said in March that he was ""saddened to hear that employees are resigning"" and ""deeply concerned to hear of employees being bullied and threatened"" on social media. The memo was sent to the head of Nestle's business services center in Lviv, Ukraine, as well as other executives including the company's head of human resources and head of crisis management.

Nestle had roughly 5,800 employees in Ukraine at the start of the war, but a significant number have now left the country, a Nestle spokesperson said.

Sofia Vashchenko, a manager who for nearly eight years worked in web content at Nestle in Lviv, Ukraine, before quitting this month, said in a post on LinkedIn that her team of about 20 people was ""mentally broken"" after listening to a Europe-wide webcast where Nestle's Settembri said the company would continue to support colleagues in Russia in response to a question about the company's operations there.

""People who are in the middle of a war with the Russian military don't want to hear that,"" she said last week in an interview.

Nestle initially only halted its advertising and capital investments in Russia, drawing anger from both its own employees and Ukraine officials over selling KitKat bars to Moscow.

Some Lviv-based employees sent Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider an open letter on Nestle's internal messaging board, seen by Reuters, in March saying ""our people feel betrayed"" by the company's continued operations in Russia.

Later that month, Nestle said it was halting the sale of a wide range of its brands in Russia, including KitKat chocolate bars and Nesquik.

Nestle is still selling essentials, such as baby food, in Russia but said it was donating profits to charity. The three employees interviewed by Reuters want greater transparency about what items the company considers essential.

""We have been focused on the safety and security of our Ukrainian colleagues and doing all we can to support them and their families,"" a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that it has been giving people advance salary payments, one-off payments to support relocations and offering people jobs in other Nestle operating companies.

In response to a question about reports of Ukrainian employees refusing to speak with Russian colleagues, Nestle told Reuters that it ""immediately organized for all activities serving Nestle Russia to be handled out of Russia directly,"" a move that separated employees there from those in Ukraine.

""Of course I don't want to work with people in Russia. We don't know who is OK with the war,"" Lviv-based Nestle employee Mariana said on Tuesday. She asked that her last name not be used because she is not authorized to talk with the media.

""In (my team) we've stopped working with Russia and never want to work with them again."""

Nestle India Ltd expects the price of commodities to surge globally and to some extent locally because of supply chain constraints, the maker of products including Nescafe instant coffee, Kit Kat chocolate bars and Maggi noodles said in its annual report for 2021.

Last year, commodity prices increased substantially, and the trend is set to continue in the quarters ahead, Nestle India said.

“Input prices are expected to be on a bullish trend both globally and to some extent locally. Fresh milk prices are expected to remain firm with continued increase in demand and rise in feed costs to farmers,” the annual report said.

Commodity prices soared in 2021 following a broad-based decline in 2020, the report said, with prices of several commodities hitting record highs.

“Food prices shot up by 22 percent in 2021, reaching their highest levels in a decade, with sharp increases in vegetable oils, cereals and dairy prices,” it added.

In February, Nestle India Managing Director Suresh Narayanan told journalists that higher inflation is here to stay and as a result the company was considering “judicious price hikes” going ahead.

Nestle is grappling with inflation in key commodities and raw materials such as arabica coffee, edible oils, sugar, wheat flour, skimmed milk powder, aluminium, plastic, paper and so on.

Margins hurt

The prices of several of these products are at 10-year highs. Nestle’s gross margin in the December quarter dropped by 205 basis points year-on-year. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

In the December quarter, Nestle hiked prices in the range of 1-2 percent.

Nestle India’s revenue from operations climbed to Rs 14,709 crore in 2021 from Rs 13,350 crore in 2020. It earned a net profit of Rs 2,145 crore in the year, a 3 percent rise over Rs 2,082 crore in 2020.

Throughout 2021, makers of packaged consumer products, or fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), struggled with inflation in the prices of key inputs that hurt their growth and dented profit margins.

Most companies had been expecting relief in the quarters ahead, but the war between Ukraine and Russia and subsequent disruptions in supplies of several commodities and higher fuel prices is again stoking inflation.

“After some level of stabilization towards the end of CY21, key inputs are witnessing another bout of inflation. Concerns are particularly high for palm oil and crude oil prices, which are up 40-50 percent in the last three months on top of a 30-40 percent jump in CY21,” said a report by Jefferies.

“The Russia-Ukraine crisis has also been pushing up prices of wheat and edible oils, and this may have ripple effects in India, although the extent may be lower given the inward nature of the market,” it added."

Nestlé India Ltd, on February 17, reported a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 386.6 crore for the fourth quarter ended December 2021, down 20 percent from Rs 483 crore a year earlier.

Nestle India follows January-December as the financial year.

The profit stands lower by 37.7 percent from Rs 617 crore reported in the previous quarter which included a contingency provisioning of Rs 38 crore without which the profit would have been higher.

The FMCG giant reported operating revenues of Rs 3,739 crore, posting 8.9 percent rise over the Rs 3,433 crore topline a year back. On a sequential basis, the revenue declined 4 percent from Rs 3,883 crore clocked in the previous quarter.

Why we've been craving Maggi during the pandemic

The performance was driven largely by increase in revenues in the domestic markets due to rise in out-of-home consumption, while exports declined on a year-on-year basis.

Suresh Narayanan, Chairman & Managing Director, said, “Nestlé India witnessed broad based, double digit, volume and mix led growth, despite a highly volatile economic environment”.

“Strong growth momentum continued in MAGGI Noodles aided by increased availability, KITKAT and MUNCH registered stellar growth throughout the year while NESCAFÉ Classic continued to deliver double digit growth”, he added while commenting on the performance for the quarter.

The domestic sales for the quarter increased 9.2 percent which was broad based and largely driven by volume & mix. Export Sales were lower by 6.6 percent largely due to change in product mix

EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) for the quarter came in at Rs 866 crore with a growth of 11 percent on year compared to Rs 777 crore last year. On a sequential basis, the EBITDA is lower by 9 percent due to higher other expenses.

Consequently, EBITDA margins for the quarter improved by 50 bps on year to 23.2 percent while there was a decline of 130 bps on a sequential basis.

“We continue to witness high inflation in our key raw and packaging materials, where many are at 10-year highs”, added Narayanan. “However, we remain confident of our ability and competencies and will continue to make all efforts towards cost optimization and seeking systematic efficiencies to mitigate the impact”.

Net margins however, declined both on year as well as sequential basis, due to lower other income and higher depreciation expenses.

Net margins for the quarter came in at 10 percent with a decline of 3.7 percent on year and 5.6 percent on quarterly basis.

Commodity Outlook

Price outlook for key categories like edible oils, coffee, wheat, fuel remains firm to bullish while costs of packaging materials continue to increase amid supply constraints, rising fuel and transportation costs, the company said in its release.

Input prices are expected to be on bullish trend both globally and to some extent locally. Fresh milk prices are expected to remain firm with continued increase in demand and rise in feed costs to farmers.

“In an environment of raw and packaging material inflation, we continue to keenly look for opportunities for cost optimization and efficiencies”, the company said.

Dividend Payout

The company's board also cleared a final dividend of Rs 65 per share of face value of Rs 10 per share. The total dividend for 2021 aggregates to Rs 200 per equity share as the company had earlier paid a dividend of Rs 25 per share in May 2021 and a dividend of Rs 110 per share was paid in November 2021.

When Aude Gandon and her husband decided to stay put on different continents, each with one of the couple’s kids, little did they know that what was going to be a few days of separation would become months of staying apart. Separated from family, friends and colleagues, those months were a lesson in what really matters in life.

It was the first year of the pandemic. Borders closed fast but coronavirus travelled faster, leaving people and places devastated in its wake.

We stockpiled toilet paper, sanitiser and Maggi in apocalyptic fashion. We sang and clanged thalis from our balconies, and millions discovered the joys and pains of working from home for the first time.

While we waited for vaccines, we put herbs and haldi in everything from lattes to lipsticks. Men learnt to cook and women working from home doubled up as 24x7 human snack-dispensers. Parents began running out of ideas for entertainment and recipes. It’s a sentiment Gandon is familiar with.

2020 was also the year Gandon became the first-ever global chief marketing officer of Nestle, which is among the top three largest food companies in the world.

Nestle owns global power brands such as Nescafe, KitKat, Cerelac and Maggi, which became the ultimate comfort food and back-up dinner for people in locked-down India. And to think that just seven years ago Maggi had almost lost almost all its magic and market share over the lead controversy. Its spectacular rise in the years since is the stuff of brand legends.

But as consumers become increasingly conscious about how they live and what they eat, reading pack labels for sugar and sodium content and questioning companies’ sustainability credentials, how is Nestle keeping its biggest brands in play in our homes in a post-pandemic world?

In an exclusive and freewheeling conversation with Storyboard18, Gandon tells us how Nestle is future-proofing its brands. She highlights how it’s preparing for a digital-first world and navigating the minefield of public sentiments online. We talk about the reality of TikTok turning into a global recipe platform and chat about metaverse and NFTs (non-fungible tokens), realistically.

Gandon also spotlights the power of Purpose in building future-fit businesses and brands, dismissing the recent vehement criticism against the idea of brands striving to serve a higher purpose in society. Why can't you have your candy-with-a-cause and eat it too?

Edited for clarity.

You joined Nestle in 2020 as its first global chief marketing officer, after several years at Google and many years on the agency side with Publicis Groupe. Given all the experience you’ve gathered, can you tell us how you are future-proofing Nestle brands?

The first thing is all the marketing fundamentals. It's very important to remember everything we've learned for a while on marketing, on brands and brand strategy. We are making sure that all our brands have a clear strategy and have a clear purpose. To be strong, active and relevant for people in the new normal, as we call it, a brand needs to have a purpose.

Consumers are looking into what type of ingredients have been used and how they have been grown and processed. But also what does this brand do to give back to society and support communities. It's also a challenge because you need to make sure that your purpose is really synced to the reality of your brand and your business.

We are making sure that everything we do is fit for the digital world. The acceleration has been crazy. I don't think any of us would have imagined needing a QR code to get into a restaurant. It's been two years so the habits that have developed, the adoption of new apps and tools, is going to stay.

And then the third leg is on sustainability. It's a different subject but purpose and sustainability are also linked. How brands are contributing to the future of the planet and to the future of the communities as well. Because, around the world, we all have accepted now that there are some actions to be made.

All these are very important parts of our business and to keep innovating on brands to make sure that they are going to be fit for the future.

We’ve heard some very brutal criticism of brands with ‘Purpose’, recently. Critics have asked why sauces and shampoo, candy and confectionery must serve a higher societal purpose. What’s your take?

I think it’s very important and paramount. I don't think it's new. Some brands have done it for a long time. And I'm a bit surprised. Who decides that some companies or products couldn’t have an impact on society?

I don't see why your shampoo can’t have an impact on society. You can't separate a brand, a product and a company from really wanting to invest in the society and the planet it's active on, it's living on. I actually don't agree with the debate at all. It’s important for every brand and every product around the world.

People are becoming more conscious about how they live, what they consume and what they eat. How is Nestle addressing the trend toward healthier living? Because, at the end of the day, you are in the business of making snacks and confectionery.

The pandemic has shed even more light on the importance of health, and nutrition is a part of health. We really believe that a healthy lifestyle is also linked to a balanced and tasty diet. Taste is very important as well because there's an element of pleasure in food.

We are constantly reevaluating our recipes and looking at the ingredients. We have new brands and we are also always looking at making sure that our brands get healthier. That's a constant kind of focus for us. Maggi is a brand that has always really been promoting home-cooking and the whole kind of nutritious quality of homemade food.

During the pandemic Maggi was at the heart of it. Suddenly everyone was in the kitchen. Some had to learn how to cook and other people had to cook more. I'm a mother and I was suddenly faced with having to do my job but also to make sure to cook two meals a day. I was running out of ideas for recipes quickly. And Maggi was really there with its websites by giving tips, nutrition advice and more recipes. We had an incredible relationship with the people who were kind of looking for inspiration every day.

So that's also a part of a healthy lifestyle. It is cooking for yourself, learning how to cook, choosing your ingredients and having a brand like Maggi supporting you in the journey.

What's the next big thing coming down the line in terms of technology? Right now, the buzzwords are metaverse and NFTs. Is it the marketer’s shiny new toy? Is it a distraction?

AR (augmented reality) is really kind of helping us to provide new experiences and shopping experiences. On Maggi and cooking, I think AR is going to enable us to get even more immersive experiences.

I do see AR having an impact on how we can increase our two-way relationship with consumers. Same thing for retail. The shopping experience being online or offline is also going to continue to evolve and to be really immersive.

When I look at metaverse today it's already a reality in some categories like gaming. But it’s a bit remote. NFTs are way more remote from us right now. We are, of course, looking and paying attention to everything that is happening.

All of these technologies in our lives means that there’s an even greater amount of data generated about us. We live in a hyper connected world and at the same time there's a sort of privacy consciousness among consumers and companies. What’s your view as a marketer?

Data privacy is paramount. Everybody has the right to have their data protected and private. And that's exactly the same position that Nestle as a corporate company has. You were asking earlier about how to future-proof your business. For me, making sure that we have everything in place to keep our consumers’ data safe is the number one way to actually be future-proof. Because data is very important for marketing. But if we don't pay attention to the privacy of this data, there's no way we can do business properly.

Can you share a few examples of work on Nestle brands which are the benchmarks for you?

You were talking about purpose. I think Maggi is naturally a brand with purpose from a long time ago, even before anybody talked about purpose. What it did during the pandemic, you know, adapted its tone to the need of comfort and encouragement that we all felt. It answered the expectation and the questions people had about things like would the product be available and so on. That, for me, was extremely efficient marketing because it was really true to the brand. But it was also right on point for the time, completely answering a consumer need or question.

Then, of course, you can look at how we are using and adapting all our messaging on different platforms. Nescafe does it extremely well as well, having different types of messages depending on what is the platform and what are the audiences on the platform. And we still have a lot to learn.

We were talking about recipes earlier on. TikTok is now one of the biggest recipe platforms in the world and we're not very active on it yet. So, we are following the constant evolution of the world surrounding us as well.

Why hasn't Nestle jumped on the TikTok wagon yet?

It was also pending of who was the audience on the platform and it started by being a young audience. It was not always relevant for us and our products. What has been interesting to see, as we were talking about the impact of the pandemic, suddenly different generations were living under the same roof. We've also seen adoption from different generations on different platforms, exchanging a bit of what they are using. So it has an impact on people's behavior.

We live in increasingly polarized times where the slightest provocation of any kind can trigger “outrage” and a catastrophe for brands, landing them in the middle of ‘cancel culture’. As a global marketer with brands in so many different countries, cultures and contexts, how do you deal with the minefield of public sentiments?

Obviously with caution and with respect, and I think this is one of the biggest traits of Nestle. We have 186 teams around the world who understand the local culture and context. We work a lot with our local markets and there's a lot of things which are done locally as well.

Compared to other big global companies, most of our day-to-day marketing messaging is still done locally. That really helps because it means that we can adapt and be a lot closer to what is relevant, and what is acceptable as well by the people in a given market. It's complex, but it's definitely powerful for us.

Do you think people have a hard time discerning between actual consumer sentiment and the social media outrage and rhetoric that might be disproportionately amplified?

Yes, there's definitely an amplification effect. As a marketer, social media is incredible because it gives us incredible insights as well on people’s sentiments, trends which are picking up, and so on. It’s also a source for our R&D teams, we work with them to see where consumption is going. But I always caution the teams about the bubble effect.

If there is something which is asking us a question, then I think we need to go back to some of the fundamentals and do a bigger research. Really kind of go and interview people, get a bit deeper. So we can separate ourselves from what is a surface, a bubble in a way, and what is a true sentiment? Then we will also know how to adapt our strategy while messaging. I think it's a time where critical and analytical sense are actually very important.

Why does Japan have so many types of KitKat? (Matcha, melon, strawberry tiramisu, caramel pudding, aloe yogurt, baked potato and chocolate, pistachio, wasabi, sake, sports drink and cough-drop flavour, are just a few among several KitKat variations launched in Japan over the years.)

You know, it's funny because it's exactly coming back to your previous questions. The strength of Nestle is its ability to listen to what is a market insight, what is an interest, what is a certain behaviour or taste, which is in one market and not in another. That's also why we sometimes adapt recipes, adding certain nutritional ingredients to our products depending on the local diet.

In Japan, someone had this idea of trying to play with KitKats. It was very clear that the Japanese liked different kinds of sweet taste. There was obviously matcha which is a very specific taste and a very specific ingredient of Japan and they launched it. It was a great success and then, you know, creativity takes over. That for me is a typical example of the beauty of Nestle. It's linked with each local culture and local context.

"January 12, 2022 01:47 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/investing-in-quality-stocks-may-be-the-best-hedge-against-inflation-7926341.html,"Inflation is back. Retail inflation rose to 4.48 percent in October 2021 and is pegged to cross the 6 percent mark in early 2022. And not just in India. As a result, businesses have started facing the heat with prices of crude oil, raw material etc. on the rise.

One way to beat inflation is to invest in 'quality stocks'. But let us first understand how inflation impacts businesses.

Inflation has a cascading effect on the overall business. To begin with, it leads to an increase in the costs of raw material, production and borrowings, resulting in lower profit margins.

Companies fight inflation in two ways. One, they increase their prices and pass on the burden of increased costs to consumers (even when product demand is flat and capacity is not fully utilized). Look at what companies like Asian Paints, HUL, ITC and Britannia Industries have done. And two, they increase their production volume with minimal additional capital investment, so the price burden can be minimized by way of better utilization of production capacity. Marico is a recent example of this.

In most cases, you'll notice that quality companies don't hesitate to play around with their pricing power and increase prices during inflation. That's because they enjoy a strong goodwill in the market and have a fiercely loyal customer base. Therefore, they face minimal risk of drop in sales volumes.

Nestle: Managing prices in inflationary times

I can't think of a better example than Nestle India when it comes to exercising pricing power in the market.

Between the period 2003-2013, when India last witnessed raging inflation, Nestle came out unscathed and exceptionally outperformed other stocks in the market.

A study of its sales and profit figures between 2003 and 2013 shows that Nestle was able to maintain stable margins across the entire inflationary period. Above all, the company had negligible debt, and hence was able to emerge even stronger.

Despite inflation touching the 12.30 percent mark in December 2009, Nestle managed to retain its margins by passing on the increased cost to the end consumers.

It is pretty much riding piggyback on pricing power yet again to keep its profit margins intact and has increased the prices of its products from 1-3 percent in 2021 as commodity costs rise.

Nestle India's stock price increased 10-fold (23.50 percent growth), while the Sensex has risen by only six times (18.29 percent growth). The average inflation during this period was 7.80 percent.

How to recognise 'Quality Companies'?

There are certain characteristics that distinguish 'quality companies' or 'quality stocks' from the rest.

Market Leadership: These companies dominate the market share (in terms of total sales) in their sector. Moreover, they tend to outperform competitors on metrics (such as distribution coverage, price, image, perceived value, brand loyalty and profitability) that gauge business success.

For instance, Nestlé India is a dominant player in the Indian consumer food FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) industry and holds one of the top two spots across most product categories in its portfolio. These include its popular brand Maggi, milk products and nutrition, beverages, prepared dishes and cooking aids, chocolate and confectionery and even pet food.

Economic Moat: Quality investors ideally look to invest in companies that consistently generate high ROCE and higher profit margins, and above all, do so consistently over a large period of time. And this is possible only when the company has an edge over competitors in some form, be it low production costs, unbeatable prices, brand value, supremacy of the products on offer by way of patents, trademarks, copyrights etc., as these form the glue that is vital to retain customers in the long run.

Moreover, this moat or competitive edge must be durable for it to reap benefits for investors.

Pricing power: The effect on demand by changing the price of a company's product is called pricing power. When a 'quality company' like Nestle increases the prices of its products, the volumes don't see a significant drop, given the fact that the brand has loyal customers.

Profitability: This is an obvious one from the perspective of investment. A great stock company is able to generate profits consistently over a period of time.

Here's a look at Nestle's net profit for the period 2013-2021 for example.

Earnings Stability: Earnings stability basically indicates that the company has a relatively predictable pattern of earnings. This is one of the most important criteria you must look for to identify quality stocks for investment.

Nestle is one such company whose earnings have been fairly stable over the last five years.

Product Innovation: Quality companies always focus on staying ahead of the pack and hence are not afraid of spending big on R&D and innovation as a means to retain their competitive edge, and hence, their leadership position.

Nestle too has always been a frontrunner in this aspect and is known to launch innovative and game-changing products globally every now and then. Their plant-based meat products and science-based nutritional concept (GRAINSMART balance) for porridge products are some recent examples.

Brand Loyalty: High quality companies always enjoy exceptional brand loyalty. This means that their customers will continue to buy their brand or products regardless of alternatives available, price or convenience.

What should investors do?

If you see all the parameters above, make a note of how Nestle clears the litmus tests on all. It therefore comes as no surprise that it is amongst the best performing stocks of all times, the returns from which defy even the risk of inflation by leveraging its pricing power. No wonder Nestle is continuing to go strong even 155 years after its inception in 1866.

Companies like these are able to not just survive but thrive in the market by playing the game on their own terms...with their eyes clearly set on maximising the value for all stakeholders involved.

So the next time you want to make an investment, you know what kind of stocks to place your bets on!

The business was established by Franklin Clarence Mars in 1911. (Image: Reuters)

US confectioner Mars Wrigley has begun producing its popular Galaxy chocolate in India, bringing the price down to Rs 10, the lowest in the world.

The Indian unit of the world’s biggest chocolate maker that manufactures Galaxy, Snickers, Twix, Bounty and M&Ms has the lowest price point starting at Rs 10 and going till Rs 500, including gift packs, The Economic Times has reported.

“This Rs 10 pack is not only for tier-2 and 3 cities; it is for people who want to watch their lifestyles. They want a treat, but want an under 70-calorie product. We want to be responsible; so people can control their portions,” Mars Wrigley India country general manager Kalpesh Parmar was quoted as saying by The Economic Times.

India’s per person consumption of chocolate is pegged at 140 grams a year, way behind the US’ 10 kilograms, the report added.

According to Parmar, the share of mouth also includes mithais and local delicacies and hence the the “job to be done is penetration, which we are doing now with the Rs 10 Galaxy.”

“India is a key market for Mars Inc to win; our lens is long term. We have seen pressures which are inflationary, and we are mitigating it, we are getting support from our global colleagues, local teams are working with suppliers,” Parmar added.

The festival season was “a positive surprise” for the company as compared to last Diwali, with e-commerce and traditional channels doing well, he said.

The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said that trade figure broke the past 10 year’s sale record on Diwali.

“In this year’s Diwali festival, there is an estimated business of about Rs 1.25 lakh crore rupees in the entire country which is a record figure ever attained in the last decade. In Delhi alone, this business was about Rs 25,000 crore,” traders body’s president BC Bhartia and secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said.

With Nestle and Mondelez as competitors, Mars is now vying for growth in tier II, tier III and rural areas with low price point, the report said."

Presently, around 23 percent of Nestle India's workforce are women, its Chairman and Managing Director Suresh Narayanan said on Monday.

""We moved a fair degree on this. When I came to Nestle India in 2015, at that time we were at about 15-16 percent. We have moved now to 23 percent,"" Narayanan told reporters at a virtual media roundtable. Nestle India, which currently operates eight plants in the country and will soon commission the ninth, employs over 7,700 people.

""That is not the end, we would like to do much better than this. And in fact last year in 2020, 42 percent of all the recruitment that we did within the company were women candidates and it is a trend that is continuing this year as well,"" Narayanan added. At Nestle's new plant in Sanand, Gujarat, which will manufacture its range of popular instant noodles Maggi, 62 percent of the employees would be female.

""One of the epitomes of diversity for the company would be getting commissioned in the next few weeks. Our factory in Sanand is almost near completion. 62 percent of the Sanand factory workforce would be women,"" he said. Nestle is investing around Rs 700 crore in the Sanand plant.

Besides, Narayanan said Nestle India has invested about Rs 300 crore so far on augmenting capacity of its existing plants. This is part of its earlier announced plans to invest Rs 2,600 crore in the next three-four years. Nestle India has also submitted proposals for the government's Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the food processing sector.

However, he did not divulge any details."

Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director (CMD), Nestle India, has dethroned HUL CMD Sanjiv Mehta to become the highest-paid CEO in the FMCG industry in India. Narayanan, according to Nestle’s annual report for CY2020, took home an overall salary of Rs 17.19 crore, a jump of 6.3 percent as compared to Rs 16.17 crore he had drawn in CY19. Nestle follows a January to December accounting year.

Meanwhile the pay package of Mehta, which stood at Rs 19.42 crore in fiscal 2020, dropped by 21 percent in FY21 to Rs 15.4 crore. Mehta with this pay cut is now the second-most paid FMCG executive in the country, followed by Marico’s Saugata Gupta at Rs 14.02 crore.

Narayanan's salary was 137 times higher than the median salary of Nestle India employees, Mehta’s was 122 times higher than the median salary of HUL employees, while Gupta’s was over 123 times higher, according to the annual reports of these companies.

In FY19, Vivek Gambhir, MD and CEO of Godrej Consumer Products was the highest-paid FMCG executive at Rs 20.09 crore. After Gambhir stepped down from the company in June 2020, Nisaba Godrej, the daughter of Godrej Group chairman Adi Godrej, was appointed the MD and CEO. Godrej waived off her remuneration for the year 2020-21 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company. GCPL appointed Sudhir Sitapati as its MD and CEO in May.

Tata Consumer Products, another FMCG major, paid Rs 10.49 crore in remuneration to its MD and CEO Sunil D’Souza, as compared to Rs 4.3 crore his predecessor Ajoy Misra received in FY20.

The remuneration package includes salary, allowances and perquisites, contribution to retiral funds, long-term incentives, and stock options.

Salaries soar

Mehta also was the only CEO in the segment to witness a drop in his salary during the year. Most other companies gave pay hikes to their top executives. Dabur CEO Mohit Malhotra drew the highest pay hike of 54.61 percent to Rs 10.22 crore.

His remuneration in FY20 stood at Rs 6.61 crore. ITC’s Sanjiv Puri, too, witnessed a significant hike of 47 percent in FY21. His overall salary for the period stood at Rs 11.95 crore as compared to Rs 7.83 crore drawn a year back.

ITC changed the remuneration structure of its key managerial structure in 2019 after its largest shareholder British American Tobacco turned down the proposal to issue stock options to top executives. Puri’s salary for FY20 only accounted for a few months of this change as it was approved by the board in September 2019. The effect of restructuring is reflected in his FY21 salary. Puri’s total pay was 222 times higher than the median salary of ITC employees.

The pay package of Varun Berry, MD and CEO, Britannia, jumped 7.46 percent to Rs 10.52 crore as compared to Rs 9.78 crore in FY20. Saugata Gupta’s remuneration jumped by 2 percent, while Emami MD Sushil K. Goenka’s salary remained unchanged at Rs 1.4 crore. However, given that he is a promoter of the company, Goenka's payout also includes dividends and could be much higher than the figure shared in the annual report.

Navigating the crisis

The handsome payouts by the FMCG companies to their top executives come in a period that has been marred by supply chain challenges and other logistics issues. Much like several other industries, The FMCG companies had a difficult time ensuring sales of their products after the government announced a nationwide lockdown as the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic struck the country.

The companies, however, were quick to adopt technology and other innovative measures to resolve these issues and eventually reported recovery towards the end of the year.

“The FMCG industry has performed well in the last two years. Most of the products in the segment are essential in nature and despite the supply disruption during the first wave, the top honchos were able to steer their companies towards recovery,” said James Agarwal, MD of BTI Executive Search.

“Hence, they have been rewarded for handling the crisis,” said Agarwal.

The FMCG industry also was comparatively less impacted by the pandemic as compared to sectors such as hospitality, travel and tourism or media and entertainment.

Nestle India’s revenue from operations for the full year 2020 grew 7.93 percent to Rs 13,350 crore, while its net profit for the period jumped 5.79 percent over the previous year to Rs 2082.43 crore. HUL reported an 18 percent growth in annual turnover to Rs 45,311 crore in FY21, while net profit in this period also rose 18 percent. The gross revenue and profit after tax from ITC’s FMCG business for FY21 stood at over Rs 48,000 crore and Rs. 13,000 crore, respectively."

The timing to enter the market is not known and will depend on regulatory approvals, the report added.

The Swiss giant had earlier had committed to spending 3.2 billion Swiss francs ($3.6 billion) over five years to improve its climate footprint. Nestle said the investment will increase the Switzerland-based company's use of renewable energy, which it aims to use exclusively by 2025. The money will also boost what it called regenerative agriculture throughout Nestle's supply chain with the planting of hundreds of millions of trees over the next decade.

The COVID-19 pandemic didn’t spare the top honcho of Hindustan Unilever, India’s largest FMCG company, in terms of remuneration.

The annual pay package of HUL chairman and managing director Sanjiv Mehta dropped 21 percent to Rs 15.4 crore in FY21 from Rs 19.42 crore in FY20.

Mehta was the highest-paid CEO in the FMCG sector last year. It remains to be seen who will take that spot this year, with Britannia, Dabur, Marico and ITC yet to release their annual reports.

CEOs of other FMCG companies fared better. Nestle managing director Suresh Narayanan’s remuneration climbed 6.3 percent to Rs 17.19 crore in calendar year 2020 from Rs 16.17 crore in 2019. Nestle follows the January-December financial year.

Tata Consumer Products CEO Sunil D’Souza, who joined the company in April last year, was paid Rs 10.49 crore in annual remuneration compared with Rs 4.3 crore paid to his predecessor Ajoy Misra in FY20.

The remuneration package includes salary, allowances and perquisites, contribution to retiral funds, long-term incentives and stock options, as per the company’s annual report.

D’Souza’s salary was 239 times higher than the median salary of Tata Consumer employees. Mehta’s was 122 times higher than the median salary of HUL employees, while Narayanan’s was 137 times higher, according to the annual reports of these companies.

Company performance and culture

FMCG companies fared better than those in other industries because many of their products are considered essential.

HUL reported an 18 percent growth in annual turnover to Rs 45,311 crore in FY21, while net profit in this period also rose 18 percent.

However, according to HR experts, CEO compensation is linked not just to a company’s performance and market benchmarks but also its culture.

“When juniors have taken a pay cut, it does not look good if the top honcho gets a hike. Compensation committees will consider this when they decide on the salaries of the executives,” said Aditya Mishra, CEO of CIEL HR Services.

In the case of Tata Consumer, the company needed to offer an attractive compensation package to rope in D’Souza, who led Whirlpool India and previously worked in several leadership roles at PepsiCo.

“Considering that the company is in a growth phase at the moment, the choice of leader is very critical and hence it had to offer a good package as a talent acquisition strategy,” said Mishra.

CEO salaries set to soar

Overall, the pandemic hasn’t had much impact on the salaries of Indian CEOs. Top honchos in the country are likely to get a 6 percent salary increase in 2021, according to a report by global professional services firm Aon. This compares with a 1.4 percent decline in 2020.

Aon said the pandemic hasn’t had a drastic impact on sectors such as IT/ITeS, consumer goods and pharmaceuticals and they continue to do well.

As per Aon’s 10th Annual Executive Reward Survey in India, which was conducted among 504 companies from more than 20 industries, the median compensation for a Sensex company CEO stood at Rs 12.92 crore, while that of private companies was Rs 3.63 crore. For an owner-promoter CEO, the median pay package was Rs 15 crore."

Nestle India’s Chairman and Managing Director Suresh Narayanan believes hard work, commitment, compassion and teamwork, among other traits, matter more than any qualification.

In a LinkedIn post on June 8, marking 40 years since he joined the workforce, Narayanan said: “happiness matters more than success, contentment more than acquisition, giving more than taking and leaving behind a legacy of leaders better than yourself, rather than being a hero!”

“I bow my head in gratitude for the many giants who allowed me to stand on their shoulders and see afar, the gurus who mentored, coached, nudged and encouraged me to do my best,” Narayanan said.

He also expressed gratitude towards the hundreds of colleagues he had the privilege to work with, who him their “unconditional respect, trust and affection even if I did not fully deserve this”.

Narayanan studied Master of Arts (MA) Economics from the Delhi School of Economics between 1979 and 1981 before joining Hindustan Unilever (then Hindustan Lever) as a Management Trainee. “I was neither an accountant nor an IIT engineer nor an IIM grad, just an economist who seemed to have strayed into a fantastic company more by accident, from an original ambition to be an IAS officer,” Narayanan wrote about him joining HUL.

He left the consumer goods giant in 1998 to join Colgate Palmolive as the Associate Director. Subsequently, he had multiple stints with Nestle companies in Singapore, Egypt and the Philippines, before taking over his current position as the CMD of Nestle India in August 2015, around the time the Swiss food and drink processing giant's Indian subsidiary was facing the Maggi crisis.

Nestle India has launched an ad campaign to assuage consumer concerns about the ‘healthfulness’ of its products after a report in the UK-based Financial Times last week which revealed that, internally, the company has been discussing the health quotient of its product portfolio.

The company has reached out to consumers through advertisements in newspapers and asked them to directly raise concerns about products.

The advertisements on Sunday and Monday remind consumers about Nestle being part of their lives for 100 years and reassures them about the quality of products, saying, “You can put your trust, as always, in every Nestle product. For it’s made with an assurance of quality, with over a 100 years of trust.”

“Recent reports have questioned the healthfulness of Nestlé products after a global internal working document was reported out of context. The portfolio analysis only covers about half the global sales since several prominent categories were not included. In fact, looking at the global portfolio as a whole, less than 30 percent would not meet stringent external ‘healthfulness’ standards, mostly representing indulgent products, which are acceptable in moderation as part of healthy, balanced and enjoyable diet,” said a Nestle India spokesperson.

“We will be releasing print advertisements over the next few days, reassuring consumers that we genuinely care about what matters to them, what concerns them and that we are there for them 24x7, if they have any questions or suggestions,” it added.

Old and new controversies

Nestle India was embroiled in a controversy earlier when traces of monosodium glutamate, or MSG, were found in one of its most popular brands in India, Maggi, by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).

This led to the banning of the product in the country in 2015, which led to a major sales loss. Nestle, however, relaunched the product after five months of a legal battle. The recent development is a reminder of the Maggi episode.

Financial Times has reported that Nestle, in a document circulated internally earlier in the year, acknowledged that more than 60 percent of its products do not meet the “recognised definition of health” and that some of its products “will never be healthy, no matter how much the company renovates”.

According to the UK-based newspaper, the presentation was circulated internally among the company’s top executives earlier this year, and it said only 37 percent of Nestle’s food and beverages by revenues, excluding products such as pet food and specialised medical nutrition, achieve a rating above 3.5 under Australia’s health star rating system.

Needless to say, Nestle wants to avoid a repeat of the situation and is extra cautious this time around.

A need for strategy rejig?

Nestle has released an ad campaign to allay consumer fears about its products but this raises the question if these companies need to relook at their strategies around packaged food.

Packaged and indulgent foods have been deemed unhealthy by nutritionists over the years, and, given the growing health consciousness among consumers, are the sales of these products likely to be impacted?

According to Abheek Singhi, MD and Senior Partner, BCG India, consumers in a recent survey by the consulting firm had shown high intent towards spending on health and wellness and fresh foods.

While 50 per respondents wanted to step up spending on the health and hygiene category, 45 percent preferred fresh foods,” he said.

However, it is not certain how much of this intent will translate into actual buying behaviour, he says, as ‘taste’ and ‘convenience’ are as much driving factors for the decision to buy food as ‘health’.

Most confectionaries and indulgent food categories have grown in recent years as they offer taste and convenience to consumers.

Similarly, Anurag Mathur, Head, Retail and Partner, PwC, said that the definition of ‘what is healthy’ evolves with time, and companies so far have changed with them by launching products that are low in sugar or have active ingredients.

“It is not always going to be about health and companies will have to create a balance between health and indulgence,” he adds.

Consumers will not stop eating snacks, he adds. However, they might look for non-fried variants. Experts believe that indulgence categories such as chocolates, confectionaries, and even instant noodles will not be impacted much by the health trend as long as companies create a balance between health and indulgence."

People are more conscious about the products they are consuming, especially food, forcing packaged food and beverage companies to re-examine strategies.

The recent developments in the FMCG industry — Nestle acknowledging that about 60 percent of its products are unhealthy and Amul-PETA vegan row— show that the discourse on “health” has gone mainstream in India. This is a radical shift as Indian consumers were perceived to be value or cost-conscious by businesses.

Amul vs PETA

The standoff between Amul and People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) took an ugly turn earlier this week after the milk cooperative’s former vice chairman Valamji Humbal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to ban the non-governmental organisation.

While the recent flashpoint has been an advertisement by Amul, it all started when the country’s largest dairy brand objected to companies labelling plant-based beverages as milk.

At the core is the global discourse on vegan, vegetarian and non-vegetarian lifestyles and which is more eco-friendly. The two sides—the dairy industry and PETA that advocates a plant-based lifestyle —claim their products are healthier.

Nestle’s fails health test

FMCG major Nestle in a presentation circulated internally acknowledged that 60 percent of its products do not meet recognised definition of health.

According to a report by the UK-based newspaper The Financial Times, the presentation, which was shared among the company’s top executives earlier this year, said only 37 percent of Nestle’s food and beverages by revenues, excluding products such as pet food and specialised medical nutrition, achieve a rating above 3.5 under Australia’s health star rating system.

After the report came to light, Nestle released a statement saying it was working on a company-wide project to update nutrition and health strategy.

Earnings this week

ITC reported its fourth-quarter earnings for the quarter ended March earlier this week. The company’s net profit for the period fell 1 percent to Rs 3,816.84 crore from Rs 3,926.46 crore in the year-ago period. The FMCG major clocked a revenue of Rs 15,404.37 crore in the fourth quarter against Rs 12,560.64 crore in the corresponding period of FY20.

Though the company reported 7 percent year-on-year growth in its mainstay cigarette business and about 16 percent growth in the FMCG business, the earnings did not cheer the street and the share price fell about 3 percent on June 1 after the company reported its earnings."

The spectre of ‘unhealthy foods’ is back to haunt Nestle again, this time globally. One of the largest food companies in the world and the maker of popular brands in India such as Maggi and KitKat has been cast in a negative light after (inadvertently) admitting that it has a large share of ‘unhealthy products’ in its portfolio.

If you are wondering what the fuss is about, here are answers to five big questions on the episode, including the potential implication on the company’s Indian unit.

What is the row all about?

Nestle in a document circulated internally has acknowledged that more than 60 percent of its products do not meet the “recognised definition of health” and that some of its products “will never be healthy no matter how much the company renovates,” reported the Financial Times.

According to the UK-based newspaper, the presentation was circulated internally among the company’s top executives earlier this year and said only 37 percent of Nestle’s food and beverages by revenues, excluding products such as pet food and specialised medical nutrition, achieve a rating above 3.5 under Australia’s health star rating system.

Even within its overall food and drink portfolio, about 70 percent of food products failed to meet that threshold, along with 96 percent of beverages — excluding pure coffee — and 99 percent of confectionery and ice cream portfolio, as per the report.

The rating system is used in research by international groups such as the Access to Nutrition Foundation.

Ouch! What does Nestle have to say about this revelation?

After the report surfaced, Nestle S.A released a statement saying that it is working on a company-wide project to update nutrition and health strategy.

“We are looking at our entire portfolio across the different phases of people’s lives to ensure our products are helping meet their nutritional needs and supporting a balanced diet,” said a Nestle S.A spokesperson.

The company in its statement cited its efforts to improve the nutritional footprint of its products. “For example, we have reduced the sugar and sodium in our products significantly in the past two decades, about 14-15 percent in the past 7 years alone.”

However, it also specified that external nutrition profiling systems like the Health Star Rating and Nutri-Score don’t capture Nestle’s entire portfolio.

“About half of our sales are not covered by these systems. That includes categories such as infant nutrition, specialised health products, and pet food, which follow regulated nutrition standards,” the spokesperson said.

The company’s Indian unit also has released a statement on the controversy.

“Nestle India believes that nutrition is a fundamental need and the food industry has a vital role to play in enabling healthier lives. Driven by our purpose, we are constantly striving to increase the nutrient profile of our products, as well as innovate with new and nutritious offerings,” said a Nestle India Spokesperson.

Hmm … will the development have an impact on the company’s Indian unit?

According to analysts, given that Nestle’s India portfolio is quite different from its parent company, the development will not have much of an impact here.

""Given that Nestle has not positioned its products such as Maggi in the health category there is no change in the perception towards its brand with the recent development,"" says an analyst at a top brokerage firm.

Out of Nestle’s 35 billionaire brands, only nine have a presence in India. Its brands such as DiGiorno croissant crust pizza, Hot Pockets pepperoni pizza, San Pellegrino drink, and Nesquik with the worst scores, as mentioned in the Financial Times report, are not present in India.

“Indian portfolio is different from the parent company’s as it is a small sub-set with a lot of localisation for country-specific needs. Also, India is one of the few countries which has had a local research and development facility for a long time,” said Abneesh Roy, Executive Vice-President, Edelweiss Financial Services.

Besides this, Nestle India has a higher share of milk and value-added milk products in its sales mix, which bodes well for the company say analysts given that milk has a high nutritional quotient. Last year, the company drew over 46 percent of its sales from milk and nutrition products, higher than prepared dishes which includes Maggi noodles (shown in the chart below). Volume growth, however, is driven by prepared dishes.

Its initiatives in the country towards introducing atta, spinach variants of Maggi noodles, fruit and nuts to chocolates and reducing sugar and salt content are being seen as an effort to increase the health quotient in its products, by analysts.

Devangshu Dutta, chief executive at retail consultancy Third Eyesight is of opinion that India usually remains unimpacted by developments in these multinationals globally as there is lower sensitivity and awareness in the country. “Take, for example, veganism which is a huge trend in the West but has not caught on as much in India yet.”

He believes the country would eventually be impacted by these developments but not immediately.

What is the real significance of this controversy?

Nestle has come under fire in the past because of concerns about its food products. Back in 2015, Nestle had landed in trouble after Maggi, its most popular product in the country, was found to have monosodium glutamate or MSG by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). In a major setback for the company, the food safety regulator had consequently banned the sale of the product in the country. Maggi then commanded over 80 percent of the market share in India. Nestle’s volumes had plunged sharply in 2015 due to the Maggi crisis. (as shown in the chart below).

Subsequently, after five months of legal battle, Nestle relaunched Maggi in the country, however, it resulted in the loss of some of its market share. Today, the company holds almost 60 percent market share in the instant noodles category, as per estimates.

In the light of these events, the recent controversy around its product portfolio becomes significant as Nestle cannot afford a repeat."

Nestle said on Monday it was working on updating its nutrition and health strategy after the Financial Times reported an internal document at the food giant described a large portion of its food and drinks as unhealthy.

The newspaper said it had seen an internal presentation circulated among top executives early this year stating that more than 60% of Nestle's mainstream food and drinks portfolio could not be considered healthy under a ""recognised definition of health"".

Nestle India has a strong Q1, here is what foreign brokerages have to say

The paper said this assessment applied to about half of Nestle's overall portfolio because categories like medical nutrition, pet food, coffee and infant formula were excluded from the analysis.

Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said that including these categories would significantly reduce the proportion of products potentially considered unhealthy.

""Given the group's confectionery, ice cream, and pizza businesses, the real figure for the group based on 2021 estimates would be 28%, which is hardly a surprise,"" he said in a note. He said the report could point to changes in the product portfolio, notably an exit from mainstream confectionary.

Nestle said in a statement it was working on a ""company-wide project"" to update its nutrition and health strategy and was looking at its entire portfolio to make sure its products helped meet people's nutritional needs.

It said it had reduced sugars and sodium in its products by about 14-15% in the past seven years and would continue to make its products healthier.

""By joining the 1.5°C Supply Chain Leaders we are committing to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions across our full value chain in line with the 1.5°C ambition – and to urge our suppliers to do the same. This is a crucial part of decarbonising our full value chain and to reach our climate targets,” Tech Mahindra's Chief Sustainability Officer Sandeep Chandna said.

Further, Tech Mahinda has committed to support suppliers to halve emissions before 2030 and achieve net zero emissions before 2050.

""By joining the 1.5°C Supply Chain Leaders, the company is trying to encourage the small and medium-sized suppliers also to make the SME Climate Commitment through the SME Climate Hub,"" the press release added.

""We need to jumpstart the first halving of emissions - and without addressing the full value chain this will be impossible. Collaboration is crucial for large corporations to halve emissions in their supply chains towards net zero, whilst also presenting a significant opportunity to advance its position in what will become the next generation of sustainable value chains,"" Head of Exponential Roadmap Initiative Johan Falk said.

""We are delighted to welcome Tech Mahindra to the 1.5°C Supply Chain Leaders, as a leading information technology company taking action to reduce emissions in line with science,” Falk added.

Under the 1.5°C Supply Chain, leaders have made the following commitment:

a) To reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain in line with the 1.5°C ambition.

b) Work together with suppliers and business partners to join them on this journey by taking action aiming to halve greenhouse gas emissions before 2030, reaching net-zero before 2050 and communicate progress annually, e.g. as outlined in the SME Climate Commitment.

Global food giant Nestle is selling its bottled-water brands in North America for USD 4.3 billion to a pair of private-equity firms that hope to reinvigorate sales.

Brands including Poland Spring, Deer Park, Arrowhead, Ozarka, Zephyrhills and Pure Life will be sold to a subsidiary of One Rock Capital Partners and investment firm Metropoulos & Co. The deal, which is expected to close this spring, will create one of the largest beverage companies in the US.

Dean Metropoulos, who previously led turnarounds at Hostess Brands and Pabst Brewing Co., will be serve as chairman and interim CEO of the independent company that will house the brands acquired from Nestle.

Swiss-based Nestle said it intends to sharpen its focus on its international premium water brands, including Perrier, S. Pellegrino and Acqua Panna, which were not part of the deal.

The new owners, meanwhile, hope to boost the bottled-water brands, which have seen slower sales growth in recent years.

US bottled-water sales have grown every year since the 2009 recession, as health-conscious consumers have switched away from sugary soft drinks. Bottled water outsold soft drinks for the fourth year in a row in 2019, according to the International Bottled Water Association.

But that growth has been slowing amid criticism from environmental activists about waste from single-use plastic bottles. Consumers have also been switching to flavored and sparkling waters, like LaCroix or Coca-Cola''s smartwater brand. Lower-cost store brand bottled waters have further cut into sales.

Nestle''s North American water business has 27 production facilities and more than 7,000 employees. It sources water from 38 active springs throughout the US.

That practice has come under increasing scrutiny from environmental groups. Last year, lawmakers in Washington state considered __ but ultimately dropped __ legislation that would ban companies from bottling ground water. And Democrats in Congress launched a probe of the industry, asking Nestle for data on water extraction and sales.

In Maine, home to Poland Spring, a water rights group is worried that the new owners will backtrack on agreements with local communities.

“This water connects to all of us and should be stewarded by the local communities who depend on them, not negotiated away behind closed doors, exploited and exported by corporations for privatized profit,” said Nickie Sekera of Community Water Justice.

The Associated Press left messages seeking comment from One Rock and Metropoulos."

Nestle told Reuters earlier this month that it has recently launched single-use sachets of Maggi seasonings in Indonesia and smaller sachets and cooking sauces in the Philippines.

The world’s biggest packaged food company is working on “enhancing the meatiness of its bouillon” for when meat itself becomes a luxury, Nestle head of culinary products Agnes Lalanne said.

It also is promoting recipes that call for cheaper proteins like eggs and canned meat in the Philippines.

“We’ll give this (affordable products) more emphasis,” Nestle CEO Mark Schneider said last week after reporting third-quarter sales, “because affordability, especially when it comes to the economic consequences of COVID, will become ever more important.”

Unilever, which markets food and consumer products in 190 countries, said it is making sure every market has low unit-price packages and cheaper brands.

On a conference call with reporters last week, Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said the maker of Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Lipton tea launched new variants of its Savital shampoo, which is priced below its Dove and Tresemme brands, in Latin America.

Consumer product companies usually pass along price and “promotional allowances” to a retailer, which then uses it to offer limited-time promotions such as 2 for $5 value deals, or everyday low prices.

Many companies initially pulled back on price-focused promotions, such as ‘buy one, get one free,’ in March and April when coronavirus-related shutdowns drove shoppers to hoard everything from hand sanitizer and cleaners to toilet paper and flour.

The demand spike strained supply chains and all parties just focused on keeping stores clean and shelves stocked.

PRICE PROMOTIONS

Chef Boyardee pasta maker ConAgra told Reuters it has increased price promotions, though not to pre-COVID levels, since early spring on products such as Pam cooking sprays, Bird Eye frozen vegetables and Marie Callender pies.

PepsiCo said it would spend more on brand advertising and marketing during the US holiday season.

Unilever said on an earnings call it had reactivated promotion plans with retailers after effectively suspending them during the first and second quarters.

Tide detergent maker Procter & Gamble brought back promotions in most categories in the United States, except where demand remains high, like for its Charmin toilet paper and Microban 24 disinfectants.

As COVID-related costs rose, companies including P&G managed to raise prices as stimulus in countries such as the United States kept cash registers ringing. But a $600 weekly US federal aid program ended in July and prospects for any follow-up government stimulus look bleak.

“Consumer spending levels are not going to recover until at least end-2022, so there is going to be a sustained pressure on consumer-packaged goods companies to offer promotions and incentives,” said Oliver Wright, Accenture’s global industry lead of consumer goods and services.

By the end of September, about 26 percent of US grocery items purchased featured a price promotion, according to Nielsen data, below the 31 percent average in the one year to February 29, 2020.

The global economy has weakened with millions out of work.

In the United States, one of the biggest markets for packaged goods, personal income levels dropped 2.7 percent in August, according to the Commerce Department. Consumer spending rose only 1 percent in August after rising 1.5 percent in July, and consumption remains 4 percent below pre-pandemic levels.

Per-capita purchasing power in Europe is expected to fall almost 5.3 percent in 2020 from last year, according to data analytics firm Gfk.

According to a survey by consumer insights firm Reach3, 30 percent of US respondents reported buying more in-house, store-brand products in June compared to March, and 28 percent were looking for less-expensive brands overall."

Out with grimy microwaves and sticky coffee machines with worn-out buttons, in with stylus pens, QR codes, no-touch water coolers and mobile apps that pick what brew the machine will make for you.

From the headquarters of Ford in Dearborn, Michigan and Goldman Sachs in New York to Fedex facilities across the United States, workers are returning after months of lockdowns to the new reality of social distancing, hybrid remote and office work schedules, and strict hygiene protocols.

The break room, where employees used to get their daily fix of caffeine and office gossip, is a big part of that reboot as coffee companies, such as Keurig Dr. Pepper, Lavazza and Nestle roll out new technology for the COVID-19 era.

Nestle says it has worked with manufacturers to add a function to its coffeemakers that lets users to make a selection by just hovering a finger over the menu and has been delivering those to clients since June.

Lavazza lauched a new model in September that works with a mobile app to whip up those cappuccinos and lattes without having to touch the machine.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

U.S. coffee machine manufacturer Bunn has chosen a different approach, retrofitting its machines with a QR code that lets users order drinks through a webpage.

Last year, supplying offices with beans and brewers was a $5.7 billion business in the United States alone, according to research firm Packaged Facts. Coffee companies, which saw lockdowns wipe out so-called professional sales that also include the hospitality industry, bet they can revive that business by addressing workers' and employers' concerns.

DASH FOR AN APP

Lavazza had a new brewer slated to debut at a trade show in May, but started redesigning it to add a touchless function when the pandemic struck in March, Bruce Williamson, vice president of innovation and marketing at Lavazza Professional said.

""We had to very quickly use the weeks (we had) preparing for an app.""

Williamson said a survey of about 170 consumers across the United States Lavazza commissioned in August validated its decision. It showed 40 percent of employees expected to leave the building less often to get a drink and to rely more on office supplies, but were nervous about infection risks.

""What they are telling us is... 'I'm going to come back to the office but I'm nervous about touching the machine'.""

Employers, suppliers and designers are also experimenting with a one-stop service that allows office workers to refuel without going outside, while those working remotely can do it from the comfort of their home.

K-cup pod maker Keurig is supplying coffee for ‘mini-marts’ set up to replace office cafeterias and offering fresh fruit, vegetables, dairy, meat, coffee and other staples. It has also signed deals with several companies that have classified K-cup pods and brewers essential work items and pay for their deliveries to staff working remotely, said Phil Drapeau, the company's general manager for the 'Away from Home' business.

Ford said more than 100,000 people out of its global workforce of 190,000 have returned to its facilities since May, but cafe service remains suspended and it offers pre-packaged meals and beverages instead. The carmaker is also testing onsite grocery kiosks selling locally sourced dairy, produce, and meal prep kits.

Goldman Sachs told Reuters that 15 percent of its New York workforce is back with standard precautions in place - mandatory masks in all areas except employee desks and limits on the number of people in conference rooms and common areas.

RETHINK AND RECALIBRATE

Surveys and official guidelines suggest offices will fill up only gradually and might even never return to pre-pandemic capacity.

GoodFirms, a Washington, D.C.-based research firm, said this month its international survey of 168 businesses showed nearly a third of workers had already returned and nearly 60 percent wanted to do so, but more than half remained concerned about their safety.

A makeover of office catering was important for addressing such concerns, says Alicia LeBeouf, marketing and retail strategy executive at food service company Canteen, which counts FedEx, Pinterest, Target and UPS among its clients.

Buffets and chefs preparing meals on demand are replaced by grab-and-go food stations at Verizon and UnitedHealth Group Inc; contactless coffee machines get rolled out at Microsoft Corp; fridges get pedal-operated doors at Mohawk Industries and individually wrapped plastic utensils replace cutlery.

At a FedEx facility Canteen has replaced all card payment terminals at its grab-and-go stations with Canteen's ""Connect & Pay"" app, which also shows which items are available and their nutritional information.

The offer values the California-based biopharmaceutical company at $2.6 billion, including the $473 million that Nestle had already invested in Aimmune, Nestle said in a statement.

The price represents a 174 percent premium to Aimmune's closing share price on August 28 of $12.60, said the food giant, which has been gearing its traditional portfolio towards health and wellness products.

Up to 240 million people worldwide suffer from food allergies, peanut allergy being the most common, Nestle said.

In January, Aimmune Therapeutics got approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Palforzia, making it the first medication approved for food allergies in children and teens.

Here is what brokerages have to say on the stock and the company:

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 16,700

There has been no material change in CY20/CY21 EPS estimates. The long- term narrative of the company's topline and earnings growth remains extremely attractive. Not only is the successful implementation of its growth strategy in recent years a positive but the packaged foods segment in India also offers immense growth opportunities.

In the near term, the stock offers better resilience on the topline versus peers owing to the nature of its portfolio and its superior efficiency.

Current valuations of 67.2x CY21E EPS and 56.6x CY22E EPS appear to be completely factoring in upside for the next year.

Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Reduce | Target: Rs 14,089

Prabhudas Lilladher is cutting CY20-23 EPS estimates of Nestle by 3.2 percent to 4.2 percent on disappointing performance in 2Q20. Though Nestle posted a sales growth of 2.6 percent despite set back in vending business, constraints in production and distribution limited gains in a very strong quarter for food essentials.

The broking house believes that expanding margins from current levels looks difficult as a cut in ad spend has bottomed out and input costs of SMP, palm oil, wheat and sugar are steady.

In addition, structural concerns on low growth in infant nutrition and beverages still remain.

What has come handy for the Noida-based communication professional in balancing her home, work and 10-year-old daughter, Gema, is churning out a hassle-free breakfast, using a variety of ready-to-eat variants.

""It’s quick, convenient and tasty,"" says Ningthoujam, alluding to Maggi noodles, upma and poha, which she makes in the morning on alternate days. Her routine, though, has become stretched by a few minutes. ""Earlier it was two-minute Maggi, now it’s four-minute poha and upma,"" she smiles. ""But I am not complaining,"" she retorts quickly.

Nestlé, the maker of Maggi noodles, doesn’t have any reasons to complain either. The demand for noodles reportedly surged over 20 to 25 percent over the pre-lockdown period. In fact, nobody knows the nirvana of ‘instant food,’ and magic of branding ‘minutes’ better than Maggi, the ‘two-minute’ meal.

""Maggi,"" reckons Nikhil Chand, director (foods and confectionery) at Nestlé India, ""provides convenience to lives, and brings taste and goodness in minutes. Just add hot water, and in four minutes, a steaming bowl of upma or poha can be served.""

Yes, it’s not noodles. This time, it’s upma and poha—traditional Indian breakfast food—in ready-to-eat and cook formats.

After cementing its place in households across the country—aided amply by aggressive marketing and branding of Maggi noodles—Nestlé is now trying to go deeper into the kitchen. Though both the products (poha and upma) were rolled out last December in portable cups—targeting out-of-home consumption—the company has recently launched flexible packs. The target now is in-house consumption.

With work-from-home becoming the new normal, and likely to continue over the next few months, there has been a spike in home indulgence. Consumers, Chand says, are finding different platforms of engagement, whether it is convenience of getting brands that they would have otherwise not consumed, or experimenting with new forms of cuisine and cooking. “In-home consumption and seeking essential products on the table has become an important behaviour,” he maintains. The response to upma and poha, he adds, has been positive.

Analysts are not surprised with Nestlé’s bullishness. The ready-to-eat (RTE) market, which was worth around Rs 2,800 crore last year, has been growing at 17 to 18 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past four years. While factors such as increased distribution, urbanisation, nuclear families and double-income households with busy lifestyles have been driving growth, COVID-19 and the resultant lockdown has acted as a catalyst for the segment.

People are still sceptical about the safety of ordering cooked food, says Rohan Agarwal, director at RedSeer, a marketing research firm. In fact, the volumes on food delivery platforms are down by about 65 percent.

Consumers, Agarwal says, are likely to adopt RTE products even for occasions when they were ordering cooked food from outside. “The RTE market is expected to grow sharply,” he adds.

Nestlé, reckon industry experts, is well poised to make most of this inflection point in the RTE category. The reasons are not hard to fathom: extensive distribution reach, the brand pull of Maggi, and a deeper understanding of the Indian palate.

“This is what has helped Nestlé crack the noodles market with Maggi,” points Abneesh Roy, executive vice president at Edelweiss Securities. “And this is what gives Nestlé an edge over rivals like MTR, who have been in this space for long,” he says. Maggi and Nestlé, Roy stresses, understands Indian taste better than most. “So they stand a good chance to take a stab at the RTE space with poha and upma,” he says.

Can Nestlé find its next ‘Maggi moment’ in upma and poha? Well, this might turn out to be their best chance to add more successful products under the Maggi stable, and live up to its ‘instant’ billing, say branding experts.

“Nestlé, by and large, is an ‘instant’ foods company,” says Harish Bijoor, who runs an eponymous consulting firm. The company, he explains, makes instant milk (Milkmaid), instant coffee (Nescafe,) and instant noodles (Maggi). The new quest for success may well lie in creating instant quintessential Indian foods, for the future. “The time is surely right,” he says, adding that time is a valued currency. “That’s why two-minute Maggi, four-minute Poha and 30-minute Domino’s,” he smiles.

The going, though, might not be easy. The biggest challenge starts at cracking the product, Bijoor explains. There are eight primary types of poha in the breakfast and snack mix of India. The poha at Indore, he points out, is very different form the batata poha in Mumbai. “Arriving at the right poha for India is certainly a challenge,” he adds.

Chand, for his part, reckons that Nestlé India has always played to its intrinsic strength. “Brand Maggi has always stood for taste, goodness and convenience,” he says.

Back in Noida, Gema and her mother are busy savouring the new products from the Maggi stable. “Tastes good, looks promising,” says Ningthoujam. Ask her if upma and poha can be the next Maggi, and she laughs at the comparison. “Noodles is two minutes, others are four minutes,” she says.

""There lies the difference.""

FMCG major Nestle India on Tuesday said all of its manufacturing plants have become operational but at a scaled down level due to restrictions imposed by local authorities and state governments.

The company said it has received permission to operate all units along with distribution centre, warehouse and suppliers, which are also witnessing scaled down operations.

However, the company said it can not access the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown on the company at this time.

The scaled down operations at various locations are essentially on account of applicable social distancing norms and the lesser deployment of people.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

""The scaling up, scaling down or suspension of operations at various locations is dependent on the directions of the Central and State Governments and authorities,"" Nestle India said in a regulatory filing.

Nestle India, which manufactures popular instant noodles Maggi besides other products as Nescafe coffee, Cereal infant cereal and KitKat chocolate, said the company is ""closely monitoring the situation and will take all necessary measures as directed by the Central and State Governments and authorities, from time to time"".

""The impact on the operations of the Company cannot be assessed at this point,"" it added.

Nestle India, a subsidiary of NESTLE SA of Switzerland, operates eight factories in India.

In fresh guidelines issued on last Wednesday for enforcing the second phase of the lockdown to curb spread of coronavirus pandemic the government allowed functioning of industrial units located in rural areas from April 20, while observing strict social distancing norms.

FMCG majors HUL and Nestle have been jointly ranked first in the industry for their approach to nutrition in the 'India Access to Nutrition Spotlight Index'. They were followed by food and beverages major PepsiCo India, Britannia Industries and Coca-Cola India.

The index is published by Access to Nutrition Index (ATNI) and hosted by Access to Nutrition Foundation, an international not-for-profit organisation.

ATNI report is published once in every three years and this is the second edition of India Spotlight Index. India was selected as a spotlight country as it has a rapidly developing food and beverages sector, a statement said.

The initiative is supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the governments of the UK and the Netherlands.

This season, 16 largest companies in India's food and beverage sector were assessed with the aim to encourage these companies to improve their nutrition practices, it added.

The other companies were Amul, Mondelez India, Mother Dairy, Parle Products, AAVIN, Adani Wilmar, Emami Agrotech, Hatsun Agro Product, ITC, Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers Federation (Nandini) and Marico Limited.

""ATNI sees food and beverage companies in India showing their commitment to provide healthy food and engaging in a dialogue on how to support India's Eat Right Movement,"" ATNI Executive Director Inge Kauer said.

Lifestyle changes in India have caused a shift in consumer habits -- from the consumption of traditional food, to more urban food habits consisting of packaged and processed foods, high in sugar, fat and salt.

""In fact, India is among the top 10 consumers of fast food in the world. This, coupled with the fact that India is set to become the third largest consumer economy, presents an enormous opportunity for food and beverage companies to make nutrition a core part of their business plans, and to adopt comprehensive, public and commercial strategies to address issues related to the double burden of malnutrition in India,"" she said."

In the last few weeks, a slew of FMCG companies announced their Q3 (Oct-Dec) earnings for FY20. Most FMCG companies reported net profit in the third quarter.

However, as per management commentary from companies, they are still grappling with liquidity constraints. Here is a low-down on major FMCG corporate results.

The overall trends suggest moderate sales revenue growth ranging from 2.6 percent to 11 percent while the profits have grown in double-digits for all.

The cut in corporate tax in September 2019 has had an impact on surging the profit margins. This should help in trickle-down effect of FMCG reviving investment cycle from higher profits, said an analyst from a brokerage firm.

Hindustan Unilever

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL), reported a double digit profit growth in the October-December quarter at 11.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,616 crore, driven by lower commodity cost mainly.

Revenue increased 2.6 percent to Rs 9,808 crore, while domestic consumer growth was 4 percent with underlying volume growth at 5 percent.

HUL expects the overall market in the near term to remain challenging led by high retail inflation, liquidity issues, and lower GDP estimate.

The consumption in discretionary categories remained more impacted than food categories.

According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services, HUL has been a stellar performer over the past decade, both in earnings (around 13 percent CAGR) and stock price which climbed 884 percent.

Also, it has significantly outperformed some of its largecap consumer peers over the same period.

ITC

Cigarettes-hotels-to-FMCG major ITC recorded huge 29.07 percent year-on-year growth in Q3FY20 profit, beating analyst expectations.

Profit for the quarter stood at Rs 4,141.9 crore, increased from Rs 3,209.1 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal as tax expenses fell 44.6 percent YoY due to cut in corporate tax rate by the government last year.

Revenue growth was 5.1 percent YoY at Rs 12,103 crore for the quarter. Of this, cigarette business contributed 44 percent to total revenue, increased 4.7 percent YoY to Rs 5,310.98 crore with EBIT rising 5.6 percent to Rs 3,755.97 crore, while revenue from FMCG and others grew by 3.5 percent to Rs 3,312.32 crore with EBIT growing 40.4 percent to Rs 107.62 crore in Q3FY20 YoY.

All verticals, which include cigarettes, other FMCG offerings (branded packaged foods, apparel, education and stationery, personal care, matches and incense sticks), hotels business, paperboards, paper, and packaging, as well as agribusiness reported an increase in turnover.

In terms of profit before tax (PBT), all the verticals also reported an increase in numbers.

Brokerage houses believe that the sales volume will be affected with the cigarette price hike in the budget.

""If the cess on cigarettes is increased it would affect sales volumes of ITC’s cigarette business as the company will pass on the increase in rate to consumers through price hikes,"" KR Choksey had said in its Budget expectations report.

Marico

On January 30, Marico reported a nearly 10 percent increase in consolidated net profit to Rs 276 crore for the quarter ended December 2019 driven by gross margin expansions as against a net profit of Rs 251 crore in the October-December quarter a year ago.

However, net sales dropped by 1.98 percent to Rs 1,824 crore during the quarter under review compared to Rs 1,861 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.

Dabur

Dabur India posted in-line numbers for the quarter ended December 2019 (Q3FY20) with consolidated net profit rising 8.9 percent at Rs 400 crore as compared to a profit of Rs 367.2 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.

The consolidated sales grew 7 percent YoY mainly led by an international business (12 percent constant-currency growth). The domestic business, which constitutes 71 percent of sales, grew by 5.6 percent entirely on the back of a 5.6 percent volume growth. Excluding the food business, volume growth was 7 percent.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) jumped 10.7 percent at Rs 493 crore versus Rs 445.4 crore and the margin was at 21 percent versus 20.3 percent.

In contrast to the industry trends, rural demand growth was 4 percentage points ahead of urban demand growth because of Dabur’s improving distribution reach in the hinterland.

According to brokerage houses, weaker rural consumption growth and category headwinds for juices remain the factors to watch.

The foods segment (12.5 percent of sales) remains the key laggard with a sales decline of 2 percent. As per Nielsen, the juices and nectar category saw volumes shrinking 11.6 percent in Q3 as consumers moved to lower-priced alternatives such as dairy-based drinks and carbonated drinks. However, the company seems to be gaining market share in this declining category.

Godrej Consumer

FMCG major Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) on January 29 reported a 5.11 percent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 445.20 crore in the third quarter ended December, helped by volume growth in domestic business as compared to net profit of Rs 423.52 crore in October-December quarter a year ago.

Nestle

The company’s Q3 net profit jumped 38.4 percent to Rs 473 crore as against Rs 341.8 crore for same period last fiscal. Revenue rose 8.7 percent to Rs 3,149.3 crore versus Rs 2,897.3 crore, YoY.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 23.1 percent at Rs 677.9 crore against Rs 550.6 crore and EBITDA margin was up 250 bps at 21.5 percent versus 19 percent, YoY.

The company board recommended a final dividend for the year 2019 of Rs 61 per equity shares of Rs 10 each.

Britannia

Britannia Industries on February 7 reported a 23.26 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in its consolidated net profit to Rs 369.9 crore for the December quarter of the financial year 2020 against Rs 300.10 crore reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year.

Britannia’s December quarter consolidated sales growth decelerated considerably. It grew by 5 percent YoY (year on year) compared to 6 percent in Q2 FY20 and 11 percent in Q3 FY19.

Volume growth of 2 percent in Q3 FY20 compared to 3 percent in H1 FY20 signifies a worsening of the demand slowdown. Slowdown in demand was predominantly seen in rural areas which contribute to 20 percent of sales.

The company had earlier said it will take longer than expected to hit its 2020 organic growth target despite posting its highest annual growth in four years and improved profitability.

Like rivals such as Unilever, Nescafe coffee and KitKat maker Nestle has been working hard to streamline its diverse portfolio in line with changing consumer tastes and growing demand for healthier and more environmentally friendly produce and packaging.

Under Schneider's leadership, the group has sought to focus on premium products in fast-growing market segments such as coffee and plant-based foods while retreating from slower-growth areas such as chocolate and processed meat.

But the German-American CEO, who has conducted more than 50 transactions and reviews affecting 12% of group sales since taking charge in 2017, said portfolio management had been ""a bit heavy on disposals and a bit light on acquisitions"" recently.

This will change in 2020, he said, with small to mid-sized deals the sweet spot.

""We're a year early on the margin, but have to push back the organic growth target by a year or so,"" he told reporters at Nestle's Vevey headquarters after the company reported 2019 results that showed organic growth of 3.5%.

Unilever last month reported underlying sales growth of 1.5% in the final quarter of 2019, its slowest in a decade. Danone reports results on Feb. 26..

""At this point, in February, I cannot promise to deliver 4% growth this year, I prefer to be cautious,"" Schneider said, adding that growth rates would slow a little from the past two years.

SCHNEIDER 'BULLISH'

Nestle shares, which are trading at relatively high multiples after climbing more than 30% last year on Schneider's progress, were down 2.5% at 1122 GMT.

Schneider said he remains ""bullish"" on 2020 and expects acquisitions and trendier products, such as its Starbucks coffee range and plant-based burgers and sausages, to drive growth.

The company has already set up new structures to turn innovative ideas from outside and inside the group into new products, its technology boss said on Wednesday ahead of the results.

Some areas remain challenging, however, with price pressures in Europe, subdued growth in China - where its Yinlu peanut milk business is struggling - and a weak performance in bottled water, for which a new strategy will be revealed in the first half.

In his first year on the job, Schneider had initially targeted mid-single-digit organic sales growth and an operating margin of 17.5-18.5% in 2020. Cost cuts helped Nestle to reach a 17.6% operating margin last year.

""The guidance is probably not a surprise given what is happening in China - its second-biggest market, accounting for 8% of group sales - and the coronavirus,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox.

Schneider said it was too early to quantify the financial impact on Nestle from the coronavirus outbreak. He said operations in China had resumed at the beginning of the week, albeit at a reduced rate because some staff had been unable to return to work.

Full-year net profit rose 24% to 12.6 billion Swiss francs ($12.89 billion), against a consensus forecast of 12.36 billion francs in a company-supplied analyst poll. Nestle proposed an increased dividend of 2.70 Swiss francs per share."

Allergan's sale of Zenpep, for people with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI), comes in conjunction with the ongoing regulatory approval process of AbbVie's $63 billion takeover of the Irish-domiciled drugmaker, AbbVie said in a separate statement.

The company, whose brands include Nespresso coffee, Vittel water and Smarties chocolates, also plans to invest in new types of sustainable packaging to meet its target of making all its packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025.

Nestle also said in a statement it would reduce its use of virgin plastics by one third over the next five years and would set up a venture fund with 250 million Swiss francs to invest in start-up companies working in the recycling sector.

To create a market for recycled plastics, it said it would source up to 2 million metric tons of food-grade recycled plastics and allocated more than 1.5 billion Swiss francs to pay a premium for the material between now and 2025.

""No plastic should end up in landfill or as litter,"" Nestle chief executive Mark Schneider said in the statement.

Major corporations, often criticised by campaigners for putting profit before the environment, are trying to respond to growing pressure from consumers for more responsible practices.

Food and cosmetics giant Unilever announced last September that it will cut its use of new plastic in packaging by half by 2025, acknowledging that the move was partly aimed at young, more environmentally conscious customers.

Fast food giant McDonald's pledged in October to speed up moves to minimise the use of plastic in its restaurants in Europe.

The government has launched several projects to increase awareness around plastic recycling and curb the negative environmental impact of plastic waste.

Aligned with the national agenda on plastic waste management, several FMCG companies are working aggressively towards using 100 percent biodegradable plastic for packaging ready-to-eat and cosmetic products.

Companies such as Marico, Hindustan Unilever, Nestle India, Future Consumer, Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Co, Parle Agro will move to 100 percent recyclable packaging by 2025 helping towards a sustainable future.

The move comes in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s push to shun the usage of single-use plastic which may curb the use of items such as plastic spoons, 200 ml PET bottles, plastic straws, cups, plastic packets, among others.

Plastic containers of all types shed layers called microns in daily usage. These are insoluble compounds depositing as toxins in human body cells, in the environment and are carcinogenic beyond a limit.

Hindustan Unilever is working with the government and other partners such as the United Nations Development Programme on pilot projects for plastic waste management.

""At Unilever, we are committed to moving to 100 percent reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025, said a spokesperson from HUL.

Recently, HUL also announced two new commitments -- Reduce our use of virgin plastic packaging by 50 percent by 2025, with one third coming from an absolute plastic reduction and help collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell by 2025.

""We continually look at new ways to reduce, re-use, recycle and recover packaging and waste as we move towards becoming a zero-waste business. Globally, we have reduced nearly one-third of our packaging waste since 2010. We are committed to accelerating a transition to a circular economy, moving from the linear take-make-dispose model to a regenerative approach, which keeps materials at their highest value for as long as possible,"" HUL spokesperson added.

Single-use plastics are majorly used for packaging in FMCG packets and sachets of packed foods, groceries, cosmetics and toiletries.

Most FMCG companies are taking initiatives to reduce, collect and recycle multi-layered plastic.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles used for beverage products are being re-purposed to make apparels, footwear, and furniture by many companies.

At an industry event recently, Marico Chairman Harsh Mariwala said, “We will be moving to 100 percent recyclable plastic usage by 2025 and we will be using recycled content in packaging.”

Early November, Marico, in line with its commitment to sustainability, announced its partnership with Future Retail’s format Big Bazaar to launch a plastic recycling program ‘Plastic Lao Paise Kamao’.

The program enables consumers to submit plastic bottles across 21 key Big Bazaar outlets in and around Mumbai.

For each bottle that is submitted, Marico in association with Future Retail offers Rs 10 to consumers, which is instantly credited to their Future Pay wallet and can be redeemed against their purchase.

The incentive provided is for all products of Marico and also for products of Future Consumer, irrespective of the size of the bottle.

Other FMCG companies, Hindustan Unilever, Nestle too will move to 100 percent reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025.

In fact, Dabur India is aiming to become a plastic waste neutral company by March 2021.

“Dabur India has set its sights on becoming a Plastic Waste Neutral company by the end of March 2021 by collecting, processing and recycling 20,000 MT (20 million kgs) of post-consumer plastic waste from across the country. With this, the company would be collecting back 100 percent of the plastic waste that it generates through its product packaging, making it amongst the first Indian FMCG companies to achieve this feat,” said Shahrukh Khan, Executive Director-Operations, Dabur India.

Dabur has already rolled out a pilot plastic recycling initiative in 2018-19 in six states.

The fiscal year 2018-19 was the first full year of its roll-out and we have collected, processed and recycled nearly 4,000 MT (four million Kgs) of post-consumer plastic waste from these six states, Khan said.

It covers both recyclables (like PET, HDPE, beverage cartons) and non-recyclables (multi-layered plastic). The six states initially targeted by Dabur are Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Punjab.

Dabur India has now extended this Plastic Waste Management initiative to 25 states in 2019-20 fiscal and the company will collect 12,400 MT (124 lakh kg) plastic waste and send them for recycling/processing.

“This would be further hiked to 20,000 MT (200 lakh kgs) in 2020-21. With this, we would collect back 100% of the plastic waste generated by our packaging by March 2021, making us a Plastic Waste Neutral company,” Khan said.

Coca-Cola is redesigning and light-weighting packaging, increasing renewable and recycled material use. HUL is working with the government and other partners such as the United Nations Development Programme on pilot projects for plastic waste management.

PepsiCo India has been working across states to collect, segregate and sustainably manage the equivalent of 100 percent plastic packaging by 2021. It has partnered with organisations to upcycle plastic into creating utility products such as chairs, benches, tables, t-shirts, laptop bags.

“One of our key targets is to make 100 percent recyclable, compostable or biodegradable packaging by 2025 and we have been striving to design all packaging with the goal to achieve optimum results with utmost efficient use of material possible,” a PepsiCo India spokesperson said.

Future Consumer will also move towards polyolefin or similar polymeric structure wherever technically and commercially feasible.

""We are exploring a non-plastic based structure with coatings for a smaller sachet of solid products and experimenting with nearly Zero Base Packaging Concept during the year through the pilot,"" a company spokesperson said. They are also working on replacing glass with plastic bottles in selective products in food to reduce the Carbon footprint.

Parle Agro has also tied up with key players such as PET - Packaging Association for Clean Environment (PACE) and Action Alliance for Recycling Beverage Cartons (AARC) towards implementing its PWM initiatives.

“We have set an ambitious goal to immediately become 100 percent PET waste free company. This not only requires us to accelerate many of our ongoing environment and sustainability initiatives, but also double our investments. We are committed to invest Rs 50 crores in the next three years towards this endeavor,"" said Nadia Chauhan, Joint Managing Director and Chief Marketing Officer, Parle Agro.

""Given our 30 percent growth rate, our ‘PET Sustainability’ investments will most definitely increase every year. Moreover, in the coming months we will be launching additional employee and consumer campaigns that will act as a multiplier for our PWM initiatives,"" she added.

Even chocolate makers are making use of upcycled papers for wrapping chocolates.

Launched in Amsterdam and produced in Chennai, Kocoatrait chocolate bars are packed using our cocoa husk paper which is upcycled, plastic & paper-free, recyclable, biodegradable & compostable.

According to government data, India generates more than 25,000 tonnes of plastic waste every day, 40 percent of which remains uncollected and littered in the environment.

The government aims to rid the country of single-use plastic by 2022 as part of the Clean India (Swachh Bharat) part two campaign.

It has notified Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, as per which the generators of waste have been mandated to take steps to minimize generation of plastic waste, not to litter plastic waste, ensure segregated storage of waste at source and handover segregated waste to local bodies or agencies authorised by the local bodies."

Advertising sector watchdog ASCI upheld complaints against 344 misleading advertisements, including those of Dabur India, ITC, Parle, Amul, Nestle, Gujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), for August and September.

ASCI investigated complaints against 564 advertisements of which 179 advertisements were promptly withdrawn by the advertisers on receipt of communication from ASCI.

The independent Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) of ASCI evaluated 385 advertisements, of which complaints against 344 advertisements were upheld. Of these 344 advertisements, 259 belonged to the education sector, 50 belonged to the healthcare sector, eight to personal care, eight to the food & beverages sector, and 19 were from the ‘others’ category.

There were several prominent brands in the food and beverage sector making comparative claims regarding the product composition, taste preferences, health benefits or market leadership.

According to the ASCI report, many of the claims were not adequately substantiated. The CCC also considered the comparisons to be unfairly denigrating the entire category in which the advertiser brands were competing in.

ASCI pulled up GCMMF (Amul), Nestle India, Parle Ltd advertisements and found them to be misleading.

Gujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) Amul Butter Cookies presented their butter cookies to be superior due to presence of 25 percent butter and zero percent vegetable oil.

However, they made a sweeping statement that “other” butter cookies contain only 0.3 percent to 3 percent butter and 20 percent to 22 percent vegetable oil without presenting any verifiable evidence.

ASCI pulled up Nestle India Ltd for advertisement of Maggi Nutrilicious New Masala Oats and Maggi Nutrilicious New Masala Veg Atta. The advertisement did not clearly indicate whether the noodles are ""Fried"" or ""Non-Fried"".

This was considered to be a violation of FSSAI Regulation, 2011 which states that “instant noodle product shall be presented as ‘Fried Noodles or Non-Fried Noodles’. The information needs to be “presented” as required by the FSSAI within the advertisement - regardless of where it appears (i.e. on pack, digital advertisement, YouTube advertisement).

ASCI also found that Parle Products Limited (Parle Happy Happy Biscuits)- The back panel of product pack claims “Net Weight: 60g + 20g* Extra = 80g with MRP Rs.10.00”, and front panel of pack claims “33%* extra”.

Though offer claiming ""33 percent extra"" on 60g pack was not considered objectionable, its presentation on pack was misleading by omission as it does not mention the basis of comparison alongside the offer claim, in font size equal to or more than 25 percent of the font size of ""33 percent extra"" claim.

Similarly ASCI pulled up Dabur India Ltd for their product Odomos Fabric Roll- The product packaging claim, “Just four Dots on Your Clothes, Mosquitoes Won’t Come Close” when seen in conjunction with the visual of the girl surrounded by a blue bubble with no mosquitoes inside and several outside, giving an impression of 100 percent protection was inadequately substantiated.

The product provides only a moderate degree of repellency (4 -40 percent, which is less than half). On the claim of the safety of the product, the CCC observed that the advertiser did not provide any test report of safety for the product when in proximity to human skin.

ASCI also found ITC Ltd (Fiama Scents Bodywash) print advertisement’s claim, “with just a simple touch anytime, anywhere"", was inadequately substantiated and was misleading by ambiguity.

The test data provided, was not adequate to conclusively prove that a forearm lab test on a small number of panel members can be extrapolated to a “real life” bathing, towel drying and post bathing situation to adequately substantiate “capsule deposition all over the body and (fragrance capsules) bursting on touch over a period of 8 hours on dry skin”.

""Recently, as per media reports, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issued a statement that the advertisers must desist from making misleading claims and that the food companies could be liable to pay a fine of up to Rs 10 lakhs. Consequences of misleading advertising are grave, not only for the public but also for advertisers as it damages their reputation and breaks consumers' trust in their products. ASCI encourages advertisers to follow the ASCI Code for self-regulation in advertising and Guidelines for Food and Beverages sector in particular so that all stakeholder interests are taken care of,"" said Rohit Gupta, Chairman, ASCI."

He said he didn't see the meat alternatives as a threat to Nestle's existing business as it doesn't have many meat products and recently put its Herta meat and cold cuts unit on the block.

Switzerland-based Nestle has also announced plans to launch a plant-based burger in the U.S. later this year, where it will compete with products made by Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.

In an interview with Reuters last week, the heads of Nestle's Sweet Earth brand, Kelly and Brian Swette, said their Awesome Burger would be available from retailers and at restaurants in the U.S. in September or October.

They declined to comment on a possible launch with McDonald's."

""Organic is a worldwide trend but is relatively nascent in India. Organic food brings together the core disciplines that Nestlé is known for in its food and nutrition space. We have been working on this for two years now. The product is made from 100 percent organic wheat, milk and ragi,"" Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director, Nestlé India said.

The Indian arm of the Switzerland-headquartered multinational company has been involved in developing farms where organic practices are in place and hiring the necessary expertise required for the organic segment.

""We have worked with farmers in Rajasthan, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh to develop organic wheat, millet and rice. We are also working with one of the reputed foundations in Rajasthan that is making organic milk for six-seven years to hone up their practices and make them acceptable as organic for us,"" Narayanan said.

The challenge in the organic segment is not in marketing but in procurement, Narayanan said. The company has plans to introduce more products in the organic category but didn't disclose any details.

The management of Hindustan Unilever , Britannia Industries and Dabur India have conveyed concerns over a slowdown in consumption after they, along with Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL), released their quarterly earnings this week . With regards to that, Narayanan said the fundamental thesis of consumption-led growth cannot be dismissed. He said that Nestlé came out stronger than its counterparts because 25 percent of their exposure is rural and 75 percent urban.

""Rural slowdown has happened, but it is too early to pronounce that it is systemic,"" he said.

Though there has been an increase in raw material prices like wheat and milk, the company has been able to mitigate the costs by creating efficiencies of scale, he said, adding that the company also plans to launch five-six new products by the third quarter of the calendar year.

On May 14, the company announced its Q1 results for the Janauary to March quarter. Nestlé recorded a 9 percent increase in its total global sales. In India, Nestlé witnessed a growth of over 10 percent. Also, with Rs 463 crore, the company’s profits swelled by 9.25 percent. Nestlé has also clocked in a total income of Rs 3,076.14 crore."
"May 16, 2019 10:25 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/nestle-makeover-advances-with-10-billion-sale-of-skin-health-unit-3984121.html,"Nestle has entered exclusive talks to sell its skin health business to a consortium led by EQT Partners for 10.2 billion Swiss francs ($10.1 billion), as the food group shifts its portfolio in response to changing consumer demands.

The proposed transaction with private equity firm EQT, a unit of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and PSP Investments is expected to close in the second half of 2019 pending regulatory approval, Nestle said on May 16.

Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider put the skin health unit up for sale last September as the group moved to ditch underperforming businesses, following years of slowing growth as many consumers favoured fresh foods over packaged goods.

Nestle was also under fire from activist investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point, which asked for a faster overhaul in July. The U.S. hedge fund has since generated very good returns on its Nestle stake, leading Loeb to praise Schneider's performance this year.

Nestle shares were up 0.8 percent at 1315 GMT, after hitting an all-time high earlier in the session following the announcement of the deal, which according to Refinitiv data is the second largest European private equity buyout since the financial crisis after Carlyle's acquisition of an Akzo Nobel unit last year.

Analysts said the price tag was attractive for Nestle at an enterprise value-to-sales multiple of 3.6 times, or a multiple of roughly 20 times expected core earnings.

The unit, which will be rebranded Galderma, is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of roughly 550 million Swiss francs this year and of more than 600 million next year, a person close to the matter said.

""EQT focuses on quality businesses. We have a lot of good ideas how to develop Nestle Skin Health into a pearl and then make our return,"" EQT partner and co-head of private equity Marcus Brennecke told Reuters.

""We will strengthen Galderma's board with relevant industrial expertise to develop each of the three business units to their full potential. A couple of prescription drugs are theoretical blockbusters with large business opportunities,"" he said.

RETURN TO HEALTH

ZKB analyst Patrik Schwendimann estimated the transaction would generate an extraordinary gain before taxes of around 4 billion francs for Nestle based on the net book value of 6.2 billion francs Nestle gave the unit in its 2018 financial statements.

Nestle will provide an update on how it will use the proceeds and its future capital structure after the deal closes.

Schwendimann said Nestle was under no pressure to announce a new share buyback given that the current one runs until the end of the year.

Nestle Skin Health (NSH), which sells Cetaphil and Proactiv skin care products, Restylane wrinkle fillers and prescription dermatology medicines, had sales of 2.8 billion Swiss francs last year.

Nestle created the unit, which will remain headquartered in Switzerland, in 2014 when it bought L'Oreal's stake in their Galderma joint venture.

Under former Chief Executive Paul Bulcke, skin treatments were part of Nestle's push into higher-growth health products to counter a slowdown in its traditional food business, but performed poorly, leading to one-off costs and restructuring.

A reorganisation over the last two and half years returned it to double-digit sales growth in the first quarter of 2019.

Schneider said in February that NSH was now ""a leader in its space"" with a competitive cost structure, and that suitors were lining up to acquire it.

""(This) looks like a very good piece of business for Nestle. Most probably assumed a price tag would be around 7 billion Swiss francs at the start of the process,"" said Jon Cox, analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux.

Vontobel's Jean-Philippe Bertschy said the disposal was the logical consequence of the sharper capital allocation introduced by Schneider.

EQT and ADIA, which are financing the deal through a roughly 50:50 split of equity and debt, had faced competition from rival buyout funds and industry players including a consortium of Advent and Cinven, as well as U.S. private equity firm KKR and European fund PAI Partners, sources had said.

Advisory firm Evercore and Credit Suisse advised Nestle on the deal, while EQT was advised by Rothschild, PWC and Kirkland & Ellis."

"April 02, 2019 07:36 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/nestle-goes-vegan-with-meat-free-burger-range-3749311.html,"Nestle is looking to take a bite of the fast-growing vegan foods market with a range of plant-based burgers, saying its recipes could compete for taste with traditional beef patties.

The world's biggest packaged foods group, known for KitKat bars and Nescafe instant coffee, is trying to defend its place in consumers' shopping carts by making products healthier, with less salt and sugar, and by introducing ranges more in line with modern eating habits.

Demand for meat-free foods is rising fast. Last year total US retail sales of plant-based meat substitutes grew more than 23 percent to exceed $760 million, according to Nielsen sales data analysed by The Good Food Institute, a non-profit organisation promoting plant-based alternatives.

Food makers also say their latest offerings are tasty enough to tempt more meat eaters' palates.

""Many consumers recognise that less meat in their diet is good for them and for the planet, but plant-based meat alternatives often do not live up to their expectations,"" Nestle said in a statement on Tuesday.

It says its meat-free burgers, to be launched in several European markets this month under the Garden Gourmet ""Incredible Burger"" brand and made from soy and wheat protein with beetroot, carrot, and bell pepper extracts, tasted almost exactly like traditional beef burgers.

In the United States the group will start rolling out a plant-based range dubbed ""Awesome Burgers"" under its Sweet Earth brand from this autumn.

Underscoring the meat-free trend, fast-food chain Burger King and Silicon Valley startup Impossible Foods on Monday announced the rollout of their vegetarian ""Impossible Whopper"" in 59 stores in and around St. Louis, Missouri."

Highlights:

- Largest listed company in the Indian food colour industry

- Undergoing a business model shift, resulting in margin expansion

- Aims for more than doubling sales in the next two years

- Valuation attractive given the regulated nature of the business ---------------------------------------------

The food and beverages colour industry — a niche segment of the dyes and pigment industry — not only benefits from growth in the end market (FMCG sector) but also has significant barriers to entry, due to its highly regulated business. As a result, the industry has an oligopolistic structure, where only a few companies are up the scale in terms of technical knowhow and quality control.

Vidhi Specialty Food Ingredients Ltd. (Market Cap: Rs 357 crore) is among the very few in the listed space which meet these criteria and offers a palette of colour solutions vetted by a stringent client approval cycle across the globe. Established in 1994, Vidhi is led by promoters (64 .3 percent share) with decades of experience in the food colour business.

Measuring opportunity size

The size of the global food and beverages colour market is estimated to be about USD 1.1 billion, with half contributed by natural food colours and the other half by synthetic food colours. It is relatively small compared to the global dyes and dye intermediates market of about USD 4 billion, but the prospects of the food colour business are underpinned by relatively steady growth trends.

Market researchers forecast mid to high single digit CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) in the medium term driven by regulatory requirements, urbanization and structural demand drivers for the food and beverage industry.

Table: Market size

Source: Bodal Chemicals, Vidhi, Sensient, Dynemic products, Moneycontrol research

Table: Select companies capacity

Source: Company

Key global manufacturers of food colors are Sensient Technology Corporation, CHR Hansen, GNT and Roha Dyechem and Dynemic Products.

Vidhi Specialty, a leading player in the synthetic colours market, faces competition from Sensient and Roha Dyechem.

Applications – end markets

Food colour is used in confectionary, bakery products, desserts, dairy products, seasonings, beverages, pet foods etc. The usage varies from enhancing naturally occurring colour, masking natural variation in colours and protecting flavours and vitamins from environmental damage.

Prominent customers for Vidhi includes Proquimac, Univar, Nestle, Mars, Pedigree and Sanofi.

Regulatory requirement – key barrier to entry

The use of colours in food is closely regulated and varies from region to region. It is reported that about 14 colours are permitted for use in food in Europe, 6 in USA and 8 in India. Roha Dyechem says there are some colours permitted in Europe, USA but not allowed in India (like Allura). So continuously maintaining various approvals (BIS, FDA, EU & WHO) and certifications (Kosher & Halal) backed by an appropriate lab with testing facilities is an ongoing requirement.

Why do we prefer Vidhi Specialty?

1.Change in operating model – Earnings accretive

Vidhi’s business model has transformed over the last one year. It has pursued debottlenecking initiatives which has increased its production efficiency to about 300 tons per month from 225 tons earlier. In addition, its sales mix has changed as Vidhi has cut down its reliance on trading.

In FY17, trading accounted for 45 percent of sales which has reduced to about 29 percent now. On account of this two-pronged strategy while the company’s topline has been steady, operating margins have increased significantly. Sales for the first nine months of FY19 have increased by a steady 7 percent but EBITDA has surged by 49 percent on YoY basis. Note that the gross margin for Sensient’s colour division of Sensient is still way above Vidhi’s, at about 42 percent.

2. Targeting more than 2x turnover CY 2020

The company plans to double turnover to Rs 500 crore in CY 2020 (vs Sales of Rs 212 crore in FY18). This would be served by its plan to double food colour capacity and go in for higher margin products. The company’s capex plan appears on track and it is looking forward to getting the environmental clearance.

3. Strong balance sheet

As per September 2018 numbers, the company’s debt is lower by 40 percent compared to the level at the end of FY17 leading to Debt/Equity ratio of 0.41x (down from 0.94x). Management expects to retire its debt in the current fiscal before new working capital related need arises for the expanded facility.

4. Export orientation

Ninety five per cent of Vidhi’s sales of manufactured products caters to the overseas markets. This makes it vulnerable to currency fluctuation but since 65 per cent of the raw material is imported it is a significant natural hedge.

Chart: High imports act as a natural hedge for currency fluctuations (Rs crore)

Source: Company

Key risk - With respect to raw materials, availability of dye intermediates from China and its pricing is a key concern to watch out for.

Outlook

While the capacity expansion plan remains on track, improving product mix, lower share of trading business and backward integration are expected to improve earnings. Operating margins should settle north of 20 percent. Hence we expect 49 percent CAGR in EBITDA for the next two years.

The stock is currently trading at a P/E multiple of 9.2x FY20 estimated earnings, which seems attractive given the regulated nature of the business.Follow @anubhavsays

The remark comes even as shareholders were waiting to see whether Nestle India will seek minority shareholders' approval to pay over 4.5 percent in royalties. Royalty is a sum paid to a patentee for use of a patent.

""There has been no discussion on this,"" Narayanan said.

After Nestle India announced December quarter results, brokerage houses including JP Morgan and ICICI Securities said updates on the royalty structure will be closely watched. ""Consensus is interpreting this as a precursor to a royalty increase proposal,"" ICICI Securities said in a post-results report.

CLSA, however, noted that the company would have to seek shareholder approval regarding its royalty payout. As per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), from 2019-20 local units of global multinationals will require approval from 'majority of minority' shareholders in case they intend to make royalty payments beyond two percent of consolidated revenue.

According to the report, even if Nestle India plans to stick to 4.5 percent royalty, it will require shareholders' approval. CLSA's estimates suggest that every one percentage point change in royalty impacts earnings by 4-5 percent for companies such as Nestle India.

""As a responsible corporate citizen, we will continue to comply with all relevant rules and regulations with respect to the existing arrangement where currently no changes are foreseen,"" Nestle India told the newspaper.

In 2014, the board of Nestle India had approved a 100 bps increase in royalty paid to parent Nestle SA to 4.5 percent through a staggered increment of 20 basis points (100 bps=1 percentage point) each over the next five years.

Narayanan said technology, brands and processes used by Nestle India belong to the global parent and these are of global standard adapted locally in the country. ""There is no patented technology that India has put forward,"" he added."

The company, whose 6 percent revenues come from exports, is now looking to tap more overseas markets by targeting countries with higher Indian diaspora such as SAARC and South East Asia.

""In 2018, our core brands have performed well...We look forward for greater acceleration as we go forward....We have two-three dozen projects (products) in pipeline for launch in 2019. These products are across categories,"" Narayanan told reporters.

Reiterating the company's focus on the Indian market, he said, ""As an organisation the one clarion call that we are working to is that we are in the business of growth to thrive and not to survive...It is not a survival mode that we look at the opportunity in India or the opportunity for growth..but a thriving mode.""

While the domestic market has been driving its growth, Narayanan said Nestle India would now look at expanding its export basket.

The company is looking at tapping overseas market with higher Indian diaspora such as SAARC and South East Asia to expand its exports, he added.

Commenting on fake news on nutrition, Narayanan said it was affecting choices and lives of people.

Therefore, Nestle India in partnership with Google, using a chatbot mechanism, will launch a personalised information dissemination website called ""Ask Nestle"", he added.

""Ask Nestle seeks to be a reliable and anchor platform for nutrition and lifestyle information for customers. India is the only market where this website is being launched,"" he added.

When asked if the company will in future also link Ask Nestle with its own e-commerce website for selling its products, he said it is a possibility.

""...Going forward it could morph into something bigger in terms of linking up with our own e-commerce intentions, if at all it happens. But today it is only for information sharing, dissemination and helping,"" he said.

When asked if there has been any impact on sales of Maggi Noodles after Supreme Court revived government's case in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) against Nestle India seeking damages of Rs 640 crore for alleged unfair trade practices, false labelling and misleading advertisements, Narayanan said ""No"".

When asked if the company is looking for manufacturing capacity expansion, he said: ""...This is a question that is coming up with active consultation. That exercise is on but I can not share more at this stage"".

Typically, our approach is to augment (capacity) at our existing factories, but it does not rule out a new manufacturing facility, Narayanan said.

Nestle India, at present, has eight factories across the country.

The company also did not rule out evaluating inorganic growth in the country and said it may consider it if any opportunity arises."

PAT Margins for FY20, FY19, and FY18 were 12%, 14%, and 16% respectively.

Nestle, believed to be in race to acquire GlaxoSmithKline's consumer nutrition business including the Horlicks brand, will continue to tap inorganic growth for gaining additional market share, if it finds meaningful opportunities, a top company official said.

However, when asked about reports over Nestle's bid for GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) nutrition business portfolio, the company declined to comment.

""Acquisitions we have been pursuing everywhere over the years. Its part of our business model of being a growing company and gaining additional market presence. So when there are prudent meaningful opportunities, we are interested,"" said Nestle CEO Mark Schneider.

Nestle, which has a growth target of ""mid single digit in 2020"", said it strongly believes in organic growth, and considers this as a 'lifeblood'.

When asked about the development over GSK consumer nutrition business, he said: ""On those specifics we are not commenting.""

On the India business, which is one of the 'key markets' for Nestle, the company said it would continue to lead as a pure play food and beverage company.

""I am a very pleased with how our Indian company has developed very solid leadership, very nice organic growth and when it comes to being a pure play food and beverage company, we are leading in that market and we are proud of that,"" Schneider said on a media round table with the visiting journalists here.

Schneider further noted that the Swiss major is also betting on online sales channel, where it is witnessing a faster growth. Its online sales grew three times faster than its worldwide offline sales and contributed 7-8 percentage of overall globally revenue.

""We are committed to strong presence in the online activity. Our online sales grow about three times faster than the company average... that gives you a sense on how much more strongly we make progress online… overtime it is expected to increase,"" Schneider added.

Nestle India, ranks 15 in terms top markets for the company globally and has crossed Rs 10,000-crore sales mark in 2017.

The group had a overall sales of CHF 89.8 billion ($90 billion) in 2017.

As a business strategy, the company is trying to renovate about a third of its products every year, by focusing on ""innovation and renovation"" to ensure healthier food and beverages for children by adding more fruits and vegetables, reducing the amount of sugar and fortifying products."

The company also said staying closely engaged with the local governments and the consumers is ""super important"" in the markets, adding that the strategy had worked in the Maggi noodles case of 2015.

""The slightest concern gets out on social media and internet, which builds up sentiments and beliefs very quickly,"" said Nestle Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider.

He further added: ""It is important in all times to be totally factually correct but it is also important to react early and quickly as you see sentiment building up...""

Recounting the Maggi crisis in India when the Nestle's popular product was banned for five months, Schneider said that there was ""a wave of sentiment building against the product, at the time it was hurting us very strongly"".

""One of the reasons why we recovered so quickly is that the product was found to be right and that was very important to us,"" he said on a media roundtable with the visiting journalists.

India is one of the ""key markets"" for the company, and Nestle India, which is listed on local exchanges, crossed the Rs 10,000-crore sales mark in 2017.

Maggi was banned by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) in June 2015 for five months for allegedly containing lead beyond permissible limits, forcing Nestle India to withdraw the product from the market. Following legal battles, the popular noodles brand was back in the market in November 2015.

Although Nestle India has regained its market dominance in the instant noodles segment with around 60 percent market share, it is still away from the 75 percent market share it used to have before the crisis. Currently, Maggi contributes around one-third of the total sales of Nestle India."

An investigation by the Directorate General of Anti-Profiteering (DGAP) has found that FMCG major Nestle India indulged in profiteering of about Rs 100 crore by not passing on GST rate cut benefit to consumers, an official said.

The DGAP, which has submitted its report to the National Anti Profiteering Authority (NAA), had conducted the investigation on a wide range of products of Nestle India and found that the company had not reduced prices of certain products in proportion to the cut in Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate.

When contacted, a Nestle India spokesperson said the company has suo moto deposited money in the Consumer Welfare Fund in cases where it could not pass on the tax rate cut benefits to consumers.

""We have taken appropriate measures to pass on commensurate benefits of GST to our consumers. We wish to reiterate that in situations where the benefit could not be passed on instantly by reduction in Maximum Retail Price or increase in grammage, the amount was set aside to be subsequently passed on and was not reckoned either in sales or in profit,"" a Nestle India spokesperson said.

Nestle India manufactures popular instant noodles brand Maggi, coffee brand Nescafe, chocolates like Kitkat, Munch, Milkybar; apart from milk products, and tomato ketchups.

As per the provisions of GST law, a Consumer Welfare Fund has been set up wherein undue benefits made by businesses due to tax rate cut have to be deposited in cases where it could not be passed on to identified consumers.

The DGAP probed the accounts of Nestle India based on a profiteering complaint against the company for not cutting prices of Maggi despite a reduction in tax rates by the GST Council in variety of items with effect from November last year.

The Council had cut rates on 178 products, including chocolates, malt extract and food preparations of flour, starch or malt extract, Waffles and wafers coated with chocolate or containing chocolate, and Extract, essence and concentrates of coffee, miscellaneous food preparations.

""Once a profiteering complaint is received against a company, the DGAP has the powers to look into the books of accounts and see if the benefits of tax rate cuts have been passed on in other products manufactured by the company as well. The DGAP has found profiteering to the tune of Rs 100 crore in the case of Nestle India,"" an official said.

Nestle India, in an e-mailed response, said it as a responsible corporate citizen has passed on the benefits of GST to consumers.

""At our request, the Authority through its communication had advised us to provisionally deposit the amount computed by us, suo moto, in the Consumer Welfare Fund, which has been done. We are hopeful that the procedure followed to pass on the GST benefit will be appreciated by the National Anti-Profiteering Authority and our stand will be vindicated,"" the Nestle India spokesperson said.

The spokesperson, further, said that Nestle, along with many other industry members have been requesting the government for clear rules and regulations to be framed on anti-profiteering to avoid any confusion and ambiguity. ""This will support ease of doing business"".

As per the structure of the anti-profiteering mechanism in the GST regime, complaints of local nature will be first sent to the state-level 'screening committee', while those of national level will be marked for the 'standing committee'. If the complaints have merit, the committees refer them to the DGAP.

The DGAP gives its report to the NAA for further action, which may include fine and extreme penalty like cancellation of registration.

""The NAA would hear the company and also the complainant before passing a final order. The quantum of profiteering might go up or down depending on the case presented before the authority,"" the official added."

FMCG major Nestle India is considering a mild price hike ""selectively in some categories"" to offset rising prices of base raw materials such as wheat and milk, a top company official said.

Although Nestle is trying to mitigate cost by enhancing cost efficiencies on manufacturing, sales etc, it may go for a ""minimum"" increase as other inputs costs such as packaging are on the rise led by high crude oil price and falling Indian rupee against the US dollar.

Besides, Nestle India is also now gearing up for the ""next wave of capacity expansion"" after having a volume driven growth in last 18 months. The company is mulling expansion of its existing production facilities besides venturing into new locations. ""Yes, the exercise is on to look at next phase of capital expansion,"" said Nestle Chairman and Managing Director Suresh Narayanan.

He further said:"" It's an active subject seeing the sustained performance."" However, Nestle did not share any input about it. Over rise in cost, Narayanan said, ""Headwinds on commodities have already started. As the combination of issues rupee and oil price, some of the domestic raw material prices are starting to increase,"" Narayanan said.

Nestle, which operates in segments such as beverages, breakfast cereals, chocolate and confectionaries, milk products and prepared dishes and cooking aid - said that it is watching trends and does not want its volume led growth story strategy to be impacted. ""If there is a sustained impact on wheat, packaging material and possibly on milk going forward, it would affect quite a few categories in the company,"" he said adding ""selectively in some categories, there could be some price increase.""

However, on being asked about the quantum, Narayanan said: ""It's not for me to speculate right away. We have bands which we follow to decide upon what extent we are able to mitigate price increase with other elements of cost efficiencies."" On being asked for the timing of increase, he said, ""It is very difficult to specify the timings but all these are moving in tandem. We just have to see to the extent to which these pan out will determine the extent to which we will absorb it or not absorb it, it will determine the time."" Nestle India presently has eight manufacturing units at -- Choladi (Tamil Nadu), Nanjangud (Karnataka), Samalkha (Haryana), Ponda and Bicholim (Goa), Pantnagar (Uttarakhand) and Tahliwal (Himachal Pradesh). In 2017, Nestle on a comparable basis, reported a domestic sales growth ""estimated at 11.8 per cent due to increase in volumes including rebuild of Maggi Noodles.""

Nestle, typically expands its footprints in existing locations, as its factories allow the capacity to expand, said Narayanan. ""Expanding in existing factory amortises the services cost in setting up infrastructure but there could be other sites as well, we could look at,"" he said.

Besides, Nestle which controls half of the instant coffee market through its brand Nescafe also launched a smart compact coffee machine called Nescafe E in India, in a bid to expand coffee consumption. Nescafe E, priced at Rs 6,499 consists of a travel mug and coffee machine, which are connected through a smartphone and is controlled through a mobile app.

Nestle has launched Nescafe E in Cyprus and India is the second country, where the company is introducing it. This would be the first consumer appliance product by Nestle in the B2C segment in India."

Nestle has finalised plans for reorganising its Swiss information technology (IT) setup, the food and beverage giant said on Thursday, reducing the number of tech worker jobs it will cut at its home base.

In May, Nestle said it planned to eliminate up to 500 information technology jobs in Switzerland as it shifts work to an existing tech hub in Spain and other locations.

Following consultations, the company has now determined that it will keep around 150 IT employees in Switzerland, compared to the 100 originally announced in May, and will extend the reorganisation plan into the second half of 2020.

""Nestle understands this is a difficult time for its employees and is fully committed to mitigate the social impact of the reorganisation, which will now be implemented,"" the group said in a statement. ""The company and the employees representatives are currently negotiating a social plan."""

REUTERS/Hannah McKay/Photo Illustration - RC1EAF3C6980

The European Union's top court today ordered the EU's intellectual property office to ""reconsider"" Kit Kat's bloc-wide trademark, prolonging Nestle's decade-long battle to claim exclusive rights over the chocolate bar's distinctive shape.

Nestle has been locked in a blockbuster legal war with US rival Mondelez, maker of Cadbury chocolate, over the four-fingered wafer biscuit which was first sold in 1935.

In a closely watched case, the European Court of Justice said the EU's intellectual property office must go back to the drawing board and revisit its 2006 to decision to grant Kit Kat an EU trade mark based on its shape.

But in a break for Nestle, the Luxembourg-based ECJ did not cancel the trade mark outright, as suggested by the court's top advisor in April, with the EU intellectual property office now tasked to re-visit the trademark.

""Today no one has won, no one has lost. Nestle has saved time because its brand remains registered for the time being,"" a court source told AFP.

""But Nestle did lose a battle as it would have preferred a full confirmation of the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) decision,"" the source added.

The EU's intellectual property office allowed Nestle in 2006 to trademark what the court calls the ""three-dimensional shape of the 'Kit Kat 4 fingers' product"".

This trademark has helped keep copycat candy-bars out of grocery stores, and punished the development of similar treats owned by Mondelez, including the Norwegian favourite Kvikk Lunsj, a Kit Kat doppelganger.

The EU's intellectual property office ""must reconsider whether the three-dimensional shape of a '4 Finger KitKat' can be retained as an EU trade mark,"" a court statement said.

At issue is that the food giant specifically failed to provide evidence that the Kit Kat shape was well enough known in Belgium, Ireland, Greece and Portugal.

A lower EU court ""was right to annul the EU's intellectual property office decision, in which it concluded that distinctive character had been acquired"" without including those countries in the case, a statement said.

The trade mark criteria ""must be shown throughout the EU,"" it said.

Nestle has already lost a legal bid in Britain -- currently an EU member state but set to leave next year -- to trademark the Kit Kat shape."

Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are expected to see a further uptick in volume growth in the first quarter, aided by a pickup in the underlying demand and driven by improvement in rural markets.

The earnings for the FMCG sector will kick-start with industry giant Hindustan Unilever reporting its first-quarter (April-June) results on July 16.

According to various analysts reports, the volume growth will also be pushed by a favourable base, given the destocking at trade channels prior to Goods and Services Tax (GST) implementation in Q1FY18.

The government had implemented GST across the country from July 1, 2017.

Almost all analysts expect a high single to double-digit volume growth within the FMCG sector in April-June quarter of FY19.

According to IDFC Securities, ""In terms of input costs, prices of crude and crude-linked commodities will continue to inch up, which could impact gross margins in the sector sequentially.""

However, a favorable price/mix and moderation in palm oil prices (down ~14 percent year-on-year) will curtail the impact on gross margins for home and personal care players, the report stated

While inflation in agri-commodities could adversely impact Marico’s gross margins, moderation in prices of milk and skimmed milk powder (SMP) will continue to benefit food players like Nestle.

However, the benefit of operating leverage, GST-led savings as well as focus on cost efficiencies could result in year-on-year (YoY) expansion in the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margins in Q1FY19.

Most brokerage firms estimate sales, EBITDA and profit after tax (PAT) growth of 11 percent, 20 percent, and 18 percent YoY, respectively, for Q1FY19.

Major players

Hindustan Unilever, India's biggest consumer goods company, had reported a 9.3 percent YoY rise in net profit to Rs 1,283 crore for the first quarter that ended in June 2017.

Dabur and ITC are expected to post double-digit earnings growth within the consumer staples universe in Q1FY19, while Nestle and Godrej Consumer are expected to outperform with strong 43 percent, and 20 percent YoY earnings growth, respectively, during the quarter.

In Q1FY17, Dabur India posted a fall of 10 percent in its net profit to Rs 264.86 crore, while cigarette-to-soap maker ITC had reported 7.4 percent jump in net profit at Rs 2,560.5 crore."

Swiss food giant Nestle confirmed today the suspension of its membership in a body aimed at ensuring sustainable palm oil production and use, blaming ""fundamental differences"" in theories on how to reach that goal.

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, a non-profit group that counts members from across the palm oil supply chain, suspended Nestle Wednesday and revoked the sustainable palm oil certificates at several of the company's facilities.

""We share the RSPO's ambition for improving the social and environmental performance of the palm oil sector,"" a Nestle spokesperson told AFP by email.

""Our approaches to this do differ and we respect the RSPO board's decision regarding Nestle's membership,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the company hopes ""to re-qualify in the near future."" In its decision, RSPO cited breaches of its code of conduct, pointing to Nestle's failure to file a 2016 report on its progress towards producing or buying certified sustainable palm oil, and only filing an incomplete report for 2017.

""Nestle was given the opportunity to complete its (progress) report for 2017 through active engagement, and has declined to submit a time-bound plan,"" the organisation said.

RSPO, which counts more than 3,000 members and unites palm oil producers, processors, traders, consumer goods manufacturers, retailer, investors and environmental and social NGOs, also lamented that Nestle had $2,000 in unpaid membership fees.

Nestle however said the problem was that RSPO had not accepted that its goal was not to achieve 100 per cent certification of palm oil.

""There are fundamental differences in the theory of change that Nestle and RSPO are employing to realise the ambition of a wholly sustainable palm oil industry,"" Nestle said in a statement.

""Whilst we respect the decision of RSPO to consider only action plans focused on moving towards 100 percent certification, we believe that this approach is not conducive to achieving the levels of industry transparency and transformation the sector so urgently needs,"" it added.

RSPO meanwhile said that following its suspension, Nestle would lose its voting rights in the organisation's general assemblies.

It also said the Nestle facilities in Australia and in Bromborough, Britain, which are currently RSPO Supply Chain certified, had had their certificates suspended.

""We will grant Nestle a period of 30 days ... to communicate its suspension to its customers, thus allowing them to seek alternatives,"" RSPO said, adding that after that, ""Nestle certificates will automatically cease to be valid."" The organisation called for Nestle to comply and commit to the RSPO code of conduct by July 20, warning that if it failed to do so, its membership would be ""terminated"".

Greenpeace meanwhile questioned the motives behind RSPO's decision. ""Greenpeace has raised at least five cases of RSPO members destroying rainforest with the RSPO in the past year, including deforestation by members of RSPO's board of governors and its Complaints Panel,"" it said in a statement.

""RSPO has not taken any action against them, but it has suspended Nestle for not buying enough RSPO palm oil,"" it charged. ""This just shows RSPO cares more about making money than protecting forests."

Two of four top brands in the Indian Health food drinks (HFD) market cornering 56 percent of market share combined are up for sale. This has raised questions on the growth prospects of the category, and in particular, on whether it makes sense for a company to sip on Horlicks?

We believe while the category itself undergoes a change, even the existing business of GSK Consumer holds value for other FMCG players and there is a scope for operational synergies

GSK reviews Horlicks

Recently, GlaxoSmithKline Plc. (GSK) initiated a strategic review of Horlicks and its other consumer healthcare nutrition products, partially to fund its USD 13 billion buyouts of Novartis’s stake in the consumer healthcare joint venture. As 85-90 percent of Horlicks and other nutrition products sales are generated in India, the strategic review includes an assessment of GSK’s 72.5 percent shareholding in the India unit (GSK Consumer).

Kraft may chuck off Complan

Worry over the growth dynamics of the Health Food Drinks (HFD) segment has aggravated by the news that the American food company Kraft Heinz is considering the sale of its powdered milk drink brand Complan in India for about $1 billion. With about Rs 440 crore sales in FY17, Complan is the fourth largest health drink brand in the country.

Interestingly, Kraft Heinz recognized $48 million impairment loss in the July 2017 results on account of continued decline in nutritional beverages in India.

What ails Health food drinks market?

As per Euromonitor, the market size for the Indian health food drinks (malt-based health drink and supplemental health drink) is of the order of Rs 9,600 crore wherein brands (Horlicks and Boost) dominate the category with about 49 percent share in trade volume terms.

This is a bit divergent from GSK Consumer Healthcare’s annual reports where the company claims 64.4 and 56.3 percent share in Health Food Drinks category in volume and value terms.

However, looking at market share trends from company’s annual reports, one finds that share has shrunk over the years. Weak market standing can also be implied by the GSK consumer healthcare’s revenue trajectory which has remained stagnant for last four years. Euromonitor’s findings suggest that market is getting increasingly fragmented as the competition heats up.

HFD – category expanding beyond nutrient drink

Over the period growth in health drink category has slowed down. From the double-digit growth witnessed a few years back for both malt-based drinks and supplement nutrition drinks, growth is now near high single digit. The market faces challenges in terms of growing competition, varied consumer preferences, health food drink substitutes and distribution reach. In order to cater to the latent demand, consumer, pharma, and ayurvedic companies have upped the ante by providing premium variants of health drinks addressing protein needs, specific age group requirements, heart and diabetic ailments.

In recent times, Patanjali has entered this market as a discount player with its brand, Power Vita, though pricing discount of about 10 percent doesn’t seem too disruptive in nature. Further, Nestle has re-entered the market with its brand, Milo and Danone and Sri Sri have launched new brands. Meanwhile, Abbott has worked with the medical fraternity to generate favorable opinion for its protein rich supplement Pediasure.

GSK – Consumer Healthcare: What’s on stake?

GSK Consumer Healthcare’s Enterprise Value stands at about Rs 26, 783 crore (USD 4.12 billion). A 72.5 percent stake sale can fetch about ~ USD 3 billion to partially fund the buyout of Novartis’s stake in the consumer healthcare joint venture. The stock has rebounded recently and factors in a better quarterly result (+ 8 percent volume growth) and news flow on expected strategic sale. The stock is currently trading at 39x FY19e estimated earnings which is at a 15 percent discount to FMCG sector average, similar to the discount that prevailed historically.

We have excluded the business auxiliary income from our estimates, which is the commission company gets for providing marketing services for OTC Pharma brands such as Eno, Iodex, Otrivin, and Sensodyne. Post sale off, this business auxiliary income would not be available and accounts for ~4 percent of sales and estimated to be about 15 percent of earnings.

Why could Horlicks be a strategic fit for few?

News flow suggests Coca-cola could be interested in acquiring Horlicks as it moves away from carbonated drinks business and position itself with a portfolio of healthier beverages. In recent times it has introduced beverage options like the Vio dairy drink, Zico coconut water, Fuze iced tea and Minute Maid Vitingo.

Similarly, Nestle as well fits in as its portfolio shift towards healthier products. Last year, the global major had identified beverage as its core category.

In case of HUL, FMCG leader can add another strong brand to its beverage kitty and leverage from rationalization of media and distribution spend.

While some of the other FMCG majors could be interested in this, midsize companies might find it out of reach due to the size of the entity. Market cap of GSK Consumer Health is currently 60 and 40 percent that of Marico and Dabur respectively.

However, in terms of competitive landscape and synergies, a couple of things to keep in mind are Horlicks has significantly higher presence in South & East of India wherein competitive intensity from other players is lower. Secondly, there is scope for overheads optimization and margins rationalization. Company’s overhead cost as a percentage of sales is about 30 percent compared to FMCG sector average of about 20 percent. Thirdly, cost synergies in terms distribution reach are possible by reducing duplication.

American food company Kraft Heinz is considering the sale of its powdered milk drink brand Complan in India, which could fetch about $1 billion, Bloomberg reported early this week.

The report quoted unnamed people familiar with the matter as saying that the company is working with an adviser to gauge interest in the business.

Kraft Heinz declined to comment.

Analysts estimate Complan to have contributed around 40-45 percent of the Rs 1,700 crore to Rs 1,800 crore sales of Kraft Heinz in India for FY17.

Along with Complan, the $8 billion Chicago-based company controlled by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital markets energy drink brands such as Glucon-D, Heinz Tomato Ketchup and prickly heat powder Nycil.

Heinz bought Complan from Glaxo in 1994. Kraft acquired Heinz in a deal valued at $23 billion in 2015.

The report of Kraft Heinz's possible sale of Complan comes two months after rival British giant GSK put its popular nutritional health brand Horlicks under ""strategic review"" implying its sale to fund the $13 billion acquisition of Novartis' consumer health business.

In India, Horlicks and Boost are sold by GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. The strategic review will include an assessment of GSK’s 72.5 percent shareholding in the company.

GSK expects to complete the “strategic review” by end 2018. Horlicks alone contributed around three-fourths of the company's sales of Rs 4,208.57 crore in FY17.

GSK is the market leader in the Rs 7,000 crore health food drinks segment with Horlicks holding 49 percent market share, followed by Mondelez’s Bournvita at 11 percent and Kraft Heinz Complan at 7 percent.

Abbott with Pediasure (pediatric) has 1 percent market share, but commends premium pricing compared to other competitors.

Why are Kraft Heinz and GSK selling their malt-based health food drinks.

In recent times players like Nestle, Danone and Patanjali have entered the space with brands like Milo, Protinex, and Power Vita, respectively. This has intensified competition and is putting pressure on margins. Patanjali's Power Vita is priced 30 percent lower to nearest rival Horlicks.

“The HFD category has been struggling to grow as fast as some of the other Food & Beverage categories in India (6% sales CAGR in FY12-17 vs 16% for F&B),” said Ambit Capital in its latest report.

“This is a result of weakening value proposition due to aggressive price hikes and lower investment by key players like GSKCH, Mondelez and Heinz in a category which requires high A&P (advertising and promotional) spends to recruit new customers as older consumers churn out once they become adults,” the report added.

Moreover, consumers are demanding scientific evidence to back the claims these companies make while promoting their products.

Historically, malt-based health drinks targeted children in the promotions. For example, Horlicks' ""Taller, Stronger, Sharper"" campaign, Bournvita's ""intelligence and confidence"" campaign, and Complan's claim of being a complete planned food for the family and later for growing children. All these claims, however, were not backed by any rigorous clinical evidence.

In more set back, nutritionists and dietitians have pointed out that many malt-based health food drinks can be harmful for children leading to obesity.

""Much of these drinks contain a lot of sugar and starch means excess carbohydrates, which isn't good for kids health, I don't advice them,"" said Avani Sidhpura, a Mumbai-based nutritionist.

Possible contenders

There are many who could be interested in picking up the health food drinks, including global majors like Nestle, Unilever, Reckitt Benckiser, Mondelez, Abbott and Danone, and Indian companies like ITC, Marico and Patanjali.

""Our analysis suggests that Nestle is the most suitable buyer followed by Abbott due to potential synergies from having products in the same or adjacent categories in India and other countries,"" Ambit Capital said in its report.

The report suggests that British FMCG major Reckitt Benckiser could turn out to be the dark horse."

Timely monsoon will bring demand stability and spur growth this year, while the fast growing e-commerce channel will provide good opportunities in the future, said Nestle India CMD Suresh Narayanan.

""The monsoon at least this year seems to be on time. We are an agro-based economy by large, and to that extent, it augurs well...We look forward to stability of demand and hopefully better growth,"" Narayanan told PTI.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted an average monsoon this year, which has already hit the Indian coast.

While referring to the recent big-ticket investments in e-commerce space, he said this channel would improve and grow further in coming years.

""We welcome the opening of newer channels... Together with the strengthening of backward linkages into the agrarian economy, we should see improvement in the over all pace of business and also the contribution to the business,"" Narayanan said.

Nestle India, which has crossed Rs 10,000 crore sales in 2017, would continue to pursue its growth here with an expansion of product portfolio, he added.

""Growth would come from existing and new portfolio,"" he said.

The company, which had suffered setback after a five-month ban on its popular instant noodles Maggi in 2015, has introduced several new products in food and chocolates and confectioneries categories. It has also pulled back some of them after evaluation.

""It's an ongoing programme, we are consistently trying to evaluate our products and I am happy to say about a fifth of our growth is coming from new products,"" he added.

On upcoming products, he said that Nestle has already announced the launch of breakfast cereals, which would be a significant move.

""Now we have secular growth across categories and that is something we would like to continue,"" he added.

Maggi now has around 60 percent market share of the instant noodles segment.

""We are at little over 60 percent of the market share and I think we have got a healthy traction of the business. New innovations have seen good responses and I am happy with the progress which has been made with so far,"" Narayanan added.

Maggi commanded a market share of around 75 percent prior to the five-month ban in 2015.

On being asked whether Nestle would be able to cross that figure in the future, he said, ambition is always there and we are trying to get as close as possible to where we were."

Swiss food giant Nestle announced Monday it will pay $7.15 billion for the rights to market Starbucks products around the world, outside of the company’s coffee shops.

The agreement gives Nestle, which owns the Nescafe and Nespresso brands, a strong platform for continued growth in North America, the company said in a statement.

“This transaction is a significant step for our coffee business, Nestle’s largest high-growth category,” said Nestle CEO Mark Schneider in a statement.

“Both companies have true passion for outstanding coffee and are proud to be recognized as global leaders for their responsible and sustainable coffee sourcing.”

The deal does not include any of Starbucks’ coffee shops and cafes.

Around 500 Starbucks staff will join Nestle, the company added.

Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are expected to report an improving trend of volume growth, in addition to GST-led savings and recovery in functioning of trade channels to pre-GST levels.

While brokerage houses differ when it comes to estimating top line growth of these companies, a key aspect market would be volume growth in rural counters picking up to levels similar to those of urban areas.

According to Kotak Institutional Equities, the performance of these companies in the March quarter is not strictly comparable with the same quarter last year due to GST-led reporting changes and the impact of demonetisation in the base quarter.

However, FMCG firms are expected to post a net revenue growth of 11.8 percent in the March quarter, which would be the highest in the last 18 quarters.

The good news is that most companies have settled down in the new GST regime, although exporters remain troubled by delays in refunds. FMCG companies, in particular, should do well, now that supply chains are running smoothly; they would benefit from GST credit.

""At an aggregate level, we expect net revenue growth of 11.8 per cent, highest in the past 18 quarters. We expect 9.9 per cent growth for the staples pack, slightly lower than third quarter FY18's 11.2 percent on a reported basis but higher on a base-adjusted basis,"" Kotak Institutional Equities stated in its preview report.

The report estimated aggregate revenue growth for the discretionary pack at 13.5 percent, while aggregate volume growth was pegged at 8 percent.

The brokerage noted that companies have started increasing prices selectively to pass on raw material inflation, after being cautious for the first few months after GST was first implemented.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 22 percent growth over the previous fiscal year for adjusted profit after tax, the highest since the first quarter of FY13. It expects the long-anticipated volume growth uptick to show up, while margins, aided partly by GST, are likely to expand further for most companies.

According to Motilal Oswal Research, Britannia Industries, Page Industries, Nestle India, Pidilite Industries, Colgate Palmolive India, and United Breweries are expected to post a strong set of numbers, with PAT growth in excess of 17 percent, whereas Emami and Jyothy Labs will report a de-growth in net profit.

According to a report from Edelweiss, the consumer goods pack's revenue, EBITDA and PAT growth is likely to be 6.9 percent, 13 percent and 12.1 percent, respectively, on a softer base.

The third quarter of FY18 saw the revenue, EBITDA and net profit of the companies grow at 8.6 percent, 16 percent and 18.2 percent year-on-year, respectively.

Volume growth this quarter is largely similar for rural and urban clusters. The CSD channel is recovering, but it will take few quarters before it can recover completely.

GST rate cuts announced in November 2017 had led to price cuts on wide spectrum of consumer goods products, which are also aiding improved offtake.

On the international front, the currency devaluation issue of MENA (Middle East and North Africa) is now in the base and hence, growth rate should look optically better.

Gross margin expansion will be limited, since companies have not hiked prices materially. EBITDA margin expansion will, however, be seen on the back of calibrated ad spends as well as cost rationalisation measures.

Edelweiss expects HUL, Dabur, Emami, Bajaj Corp, Britannia, Nestle and Colgate to report volume growth in the range 4-8 percent YoY (except Britannia whose volume growth is likely to be 10-11 percent YoY).

GCPL is likely to see a growth of 4-5 percent in domestic revenue, whereas Marico is likely to see flattish-to-negative volume growth in Parachute and Saffola.

The brokerage firm expects ITC to post a decline of around 1 percent YoY and a decline in its cigarette business on a flat base."

Nestlé has finally opened the doors to Maggi's manufacturing unit to allow customers to watch the entire process and be assured on the safety aspect, reported Business Standard.

As the iconic two-minute instant noodles brand turns 35 this year, the firm has launched a campaign that aims to explain the noodles’ journey, from farm to kitchen. Nestlé had kept Maggi's production a secret even when the two-minute noodles was banned

Questions were raised on the quality of ingredients used in the production of Maggi in 2015 when FSSAI banned Maggi Masala saying it was unsafe for human consumption with high amounts of lead and monosodium glutamate (MSG).

After a series of tests conducted in India and abroad, Nestlé’s Maggi was given a clean chit. And the Bombay High Court had lifted a government ban on Nestlé’s popular Maggi noodles.

The video, which will be released soon, will apparently open the secret.

After Maggi was back on retail shelves, the firm claims it has regained much of the lost ground. Nestlé believes the time is ripe to engage further with consumers.

The ban, however, is believed to a crucial point in Maggi’s journey since 1983. Nestlé India’s current Chairman and Managing Director, Suresh Narayanan told the paper the move had wider implications for the instant noodles market.

In 2014, Maggi had clocked Rs 29.6 billion in sales, garnering 77 percent of the Rs 36 billion Indian instant noodles market.

Since its re-entry, Maggi’s market share has grown steadily from zero in November 2015 to 50 percent in April 2016. Nestlé also introduced over half a dozen new variants such as iron fortified Maggie, less-salted and so on, focusing on health aspects.

The global trend, however, show a decline in the consumption of instant noodles in all the major markets including China, Indonesia, Japan, Vietnam, India and the US.

Nestle expects organic sales to grow 2-4 percent this year, the Swiss food giant said on Thursday after they rose a mere 2.4 percent in 2017 and a goodwill impairment on its skin health business hit net profit.

Last year's organic growth -- which strips out the impact of acquisitions and currency swings -- was the company's weakest since it began recording the measure in 1996 and missed even the lowest estimate of 2.6 percent in a Reuters poll of analysts.

The cautious outlook and weak performance are likely to add grist to the mill of activist investor Third Point, which has been pushing Nestle to speed up its transformation into a better-performing health food company.

Nestle said it had decided not to renew a shareholder agreement with L'Oreal beyond March 21 to maintain ""all available options"", but had no intention to increase its 23 percent stake and remained committed to the cosmetics company.

Nestle's organic sales grew 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter to Dec. 31, well below the 2.85 percent estimate in the Reuters poll.

Net profit in the full year dropped 16 percent to 7.2 billion Swiss francs ($7.76 billion), short of the 9.625 billion average poll estimate.

It proposed a dividend of 2.35 francs per share for 2017, also shy of the 2.40 francs average in the poll.

Nestle's growth, of which 1.6 percent came from higher volume and 0.8 percent from price increases, lagged that of rival Unilever, which this month posted a 4 percent rise in underlying quarterly sales. Danone is due to report full-year results on Friday.

Nestle and its peers are under pressure to make their businesses more efficient by cutting costs and selling underperforming brands as sales slow due to changing consumer tastes favoring healthier foods and independent, local brands."

Cuba and Swiss firm Nestle on Tuesday laid the first stone of a $55 million coffee and biscuits factory joint venture in the Mariel special development zone, the latest major foreign investment in the Communist-run island.

Nescor is Cuba's third joint venture with Nestle and reflects President Raul Castro's drive to attract international capital to help update the Soviet-style command economy and stimulate growth.

Cuba created the zone around the Mariel port just west of Havana four years ago, offering companies significant tax and customs breaks. Its aim to replace imports with Made in Cuba goods has become all the more pressing because aid from socialist ally Venezuela is falling, resulting in a cash crunch.

Nestle Vice President Laurent Freixe said in an interview after the symbolic stone-laying ceremony that negotiations with Cuban partner Coralsa and Mariel authorities had taken just 18 months, a ""record speed"".

The factory would be operating at the end of 2019 manufacturing coffee products, said Freixe, head of Nestle's Americas division. Biscuits and other culinary products would come later. The company exports goods to Cuba and the other two joint ventures are one producing ice cream and the other bottled water and other beverages.

Nescor goods would be destined both for the Cuban market and tourists visiting Cuba, while it could eventually also export Cuban coffee, Freixe said.

Nestle last year already exported Cuban coffee as a limited ""Cafecito de Cuba"" edition of Nespresso single-use brewer pods, including to the United States.

""It sold at an impressive speed,"" said Freixe. ""Within a few days that line was sold out, which shows the potential.""

Before being able to export Cuban coffee, Nestle would first need to help Cuba increase its harvest, Freixe said, which has steadily declined since the 1959 revolution.

The new factory could double Nestle's turnover in the country over the medium term from $135 million currently, he said.

So far, Cuba has approved 31 projects for the Mariel zone including nine with multinationals, Director Ana Teresa Igarza said at the ceremony.

There was no longer the same flurry of business interest in the zone as when it was created but the interest that remained was more serious, she said.

Mariel was on the list of Cuban entities that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump banned U.S. firms from doing business with.

Just one U.S. company, Rimco, the Puerto Rican dealer for heavy machine maker Caterpillar, has signed a deal with Mariel to open up shop there, getting approval just on time before the new U.S. regulations were issued earlier this month.

Igarza declined comment on whether Mariel continued to negotiate with other U.S. companies but said it would be open to doing so."

In line with other FMCG players, Nestle India today said it will make price revisions in accordance with the recent Goods and Services Tax rate cut.

Last week, GST Council reduced tax rates on over 200 items ranging from chewing gum and chocolates to beauty products and wigs and wrist watches to provide relief to consumers and businesses.

Reliance Securities research report on Nestle

Nestlé India has reported a good set of numbers for 2QCY17 in spite of trade pipeline correction in June prior to GST roll-out. While net sales increased by 6.9% YoY to Rs23.9bn (vs. our estimate of Rs22.8bn), EBITDA fell by 5.9% YoY to Rs4.6bn (vs. our estimate of Rs4.3bn). Net profit for the quarter post provision for contingencies grew by 9.7% YoY to Rs2.6bn beating our estimate of Rs2.3bn.

Outlook

The headline numbers are strong irrespective of GST impact and we expect Nestlé to report decent numbers in coming quarters as well on the back of strong brand equity, rich new product funnel, trade up-stocking post GST roll-out and pricing power. Expecting Nestlé to report 13.1% revenue and 14.3% earnings CAGR through CY16-18E, we revise our recommendation on the stock to HOLD from REDUCE with a Target Price of Rs6624, based on 40x June’19 earnings.

Business Wire India

Uflex develops Speciality Polymeric Film to replace Nylon Film

Bi-axially Oriented Polyamide (BOPA) Film (commonly known as Nylon) is characterised by high impact resistance and tensile strength, good stiffness and resistance towards fats, oils; dilute bases and acids. Although BOPA Film finds extensive use in food packaging, especially for fatty and oily food, distilled goods packaging, agricultural products packaging or medical products, its barrier with respect to gases deteriorates rapidly with increasing humidity. BOPA or Nylon films are hygroscopic i.e. they absorb moisture at ambient conditions which make it rather tedious for the converters to store them in dry conditions. A lot of investment by the converters handling BOPA films goes towards de-humidification and air conditioning of storage space/ warehouses and further proper packaging in aluminium foil etc. to keep the substrate dry.

Additionally given the Indian context, BOPA Film is not easily available domestically and has to be imported more often than not. This film is expensive further posing inventory management challenges for converters.

Considering that BOPA Film finds extensive use in packaging various products and further taking cognizance of the shortcomings of this substrate as mentioned hereinabove, India’s largest multinational flexible packaging materials and Solution Company Uflex Limited has developed a speciality polymeric film to replace BOPA or Nylon Film from flexible packaging material.

One of the very many uses that the speciality polymeric film finds is oil packaging. Typically for manufacturing packaging material for oil, the new speciality film has been laminated with Polyethene to fabricate a 2 ply packaging structure. The lamination process is also specialised to ensure superior and enhanced functionality of the packaging structure.

The new speciality film is a replacement for BOPA in its truest sense and can be used for manufacturing packaging material for all products that currently use the nylon substrate.



Talking about this development, Mr.Jeevaraj Pillai, Joint President, Packaging and New Product Development, Uflex Limited said, “It took us almost 9-10 months to develop the new speciality polymeric substrate. Subsequently, we converted it into a laminate to create a packaging solution that is much more functionally enhanced than that comprising BOPA. The new speciality film is much easy to handle without requiring any extra care by the converters. Being a fully integrated flexible packaging solution company we are in a good stead to incorporate brand protection features like Top Holographic Stamping among other value added attributes.

""I am not ruling this out,"" Schneider said when asked whether plans to raise sales of the health-science division to 10 billion Swiss Francs $10.41 billion) from 2 billion required bigger purchases. ""But we are acting prudently.""

The company is on track to meet its 2-to-4 percent sales growth target and wants to grow in a medium single-digit range from 2020 in organic terms, Schneider said in an interview published on Thursday.

On calls by activist investor Daniel Loeb to sell a stake in L'Oreal, the CEO said: ""Nestle has performed exceptionally well with its engagement in L'Oreal for more than 40 years. I have nothing to add to this.""

Separately, Schneider said the company has no plans to spin off slower-growing businesses outside its four defined growth areas."
"June 28, 2017 08:11 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/nestle-plans-20-8-billion-share-buyback-amid-third-point-pressure-2313271.html,"Nestle plans to buy back as much as 20 billion Swiss francs ($20.8 billion) worth of shares over three years, it said on Tuesday, days after U.S. activist shareholder Third Point LLC began a campaign to boost performance at the company.

The New York-based hedge fund, controlled by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in the company on Sunday when it started pushing for Nestle to more aggressively boost performance and buy back shares.

Nestle, maker of Gerber baby food and Perrier water, said its announcement was the result of a review of its priorities that had begun in early 2017. It did not mention Third Point in its statement, and Third Point declined to comment on the announcement.

However, Nestle's Chief Executive Mark Schneider, who took over at the start of the year, said at the company's first-quarter results presentation in April that he understood from meetings with shareholders they wanted to see ""meaningful steps towards improved combinations of growth rates and margins"".

These comments and the fact that buyback plans take time to get regulatory approval before being announced mean that Nestle would have submitted the plan before Third Point made its position public late on Sunday.

Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said there was no big surprise in the company's statement, but it had initially planned to release this at its investor day in September.

It was not clear, however, whether feedback that Loeb might have given in a meeting earlier this month was taken into consideration when Nestle crafted the final buyback plan, which will start on July 4.

Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy did not see the announcement as a direct result of Third Point.

""We rather see today's announcement as a thorough strategic review triggered by CEO Mark Schneider, approved by the board,"" he said, noting that this was Nestle's second-biggest buyback following 25 billion Swiss francs in 2007. The company has bought back 47 billion francs worth of shares since 2005.

""In the context of low interest rates and strong cash flow generation, share buybacks offer a viable option to create shareholder value,"" the company said.

The volume of monthly share buybacks will depend on market conditions but will probably occur mostly in 2019 and 2020, so Nestle can consider acquisitions before then, it said.

The company now expects to increase its level of debt to about 1.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by 2020. That would be up from about 0.8 times last year.

HOPES OF CHANGE

Nestle shares had jumped 4 percent on Monday, adding some $10 billion in market value before falling 1.6 percent on Tuesday, on hopes the push by Third Point would speed up changes under Schneider, who joined the company last year and took over as CEO in January.

On Tuesday, Nestle said it will focus any capital spending on high-growth food and beverage categories including coffee, petcare, infant nutrition and bottled water, as well as growth opportunities in consumer healthcare.

It said this month's announcement that it may sell its U.S. confectionery business was consistent with that approach. It also recently formed a joint venture with R&R Ice Cream to manage its ice cream business.

""The company will continue to adjust its portfolio in line with its strategy and growth objectives,"" Nestle said. There are other parts of Nestle's business that analysts have speculated could be sold, including its U.S. frozen food business.

Billions of dollars worth of assets are up for grabs as the global packaged food industry adapts to change. For example, Unilever is selling its margarine and spreads business and Reckitt Benckiser is selling its mustard business.

Kepler's Cox said the fact that the company said it was targeting spending in consumer healthcare meant ""it could be seen on the prowl for assets like Johnson and Johnson's consumer health as well as Bayer's consumer health business"".

TOO BIG TO SHAKE?

The pressure placed on the world's largest food group, Europe's most valuable company, shatters perceptions that the Swiss giant with over 2,000 brands is too big to shake up.

CEO Schneider, who had met Loeb this month, seemed to hint at that last week when he told a conference in Berlin: ""Size alone does not protect you from the winds of change.""

Coupled with a shock $143 billion takeover bid from Kraft Heinz for Unilever in February, it shows the impatience of some investors about how multinationals are adapting to change.

Loeb, who has taken on giants such as Yahoo and Sony , has argued that even though Nestle has exposure to promising categories such as coffee and pet food, its shares have underperformed rivals in recent years as it has ""remained stuck in its old ways"".

""It is rare to find a business of Nestle's quality with so many avenues for improvement,"" Loeb said in the letter to the fund's investors.

Nestle should set a target for margin growth to improve productivity, double its leverage to fund share buybacks, shed non-core assets and sell the 23 percent stake it owns in French cosmetics group L'Oreal , he said.

Whereas Unilever and Danone have recently set margin targets for 2020, Nestle has not. It has announced a productivity programme to save 1.8 billion Swiss francs by 2020, but has not yet said how much of that would fall to the bottom line.

Analysts have said that Schneider, who will lay out his strategy at an investor event in September, had already seemed more open to listening to the concerns of longtime shareholders, many of which were echoed by Third Point.

Daniel Hauselmann, head of Swiss equities at GAM Investment Management, said much of what Third Point suggested was already being done.

""Nestle is no sleeping giant that does not look after its shareholders,"" he told Reuters. ""I think Nestle should stick to its strategy."""

FMCG major Nestle India, which launched iron-fortified and less salted Maggi noodles yesterday, will look to achieve a two-pronged goal. One, to meet government standards on nutrition levels; two, to use the popularity of its Maggi noodles to notch up increased sales.

The Maggi Masala launched under its 'Simply Good' 2020 initiative is aimed to make products healthier.

“With ‘Simply Good’ 2020 initiative, we are building a new, a better, and an even stronger Maggi brand driven by our purpose which is ‘enhancing quality of life and contributing to a healthier future’,"" Chairman and Managing Director of Nestle, Suresh Narayanan said in a statement.

The fortified Maggi Masala noodles will be available at the same price over the next few week across the 3.5 million retail outlets in India where Nestle products are sold, and the non-fortified products will be phased out, according to a Livemint report.

Maggi will be using Simply Good' drive to address the deficiencies on the Indian platter, among which iron is considered to be a major lack.

According to the 2015-16 National Family Health Survey, about 53 percent females and 22.7 percent male between 15 and 45 years age group suffer from iron deficiency with an almost equal split across rural and urban India.

The company claims that the iron-fortified variant is a small step towards addressing iron deficiency, which would provide for 15 percent of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA).

""Nestle India is exploring ways to fortify its mass consumption products to close the gap and contribute to the larger national objective,"" Nestle said.

Nestlé’s plan to reduce salt is a part of its larger concern to bring down sodium levels, saturated fats and sugar for improving ingredients. The company claims to have brought down sodium levels by 32.7 percent in Maggi products over the past 10 years.

By 2020, Nestle wants to bring down the salt content to 10 percent across all Maggie products.

The company believes that with 2.5 billion portions of Maggi Masala noodles consumed annually in India, these changes will have a major impact.

Nestle India initiated the change within four months of setting up of a scientific panel on “food fortification and nutrition” by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).

The panel is to come up with guidelines to fight malnutrition in the country by making supply of fortified food mandatory for government-backed schemes such as mid-day meals at schools, integrated child development services (ICDS) and the public distribution system (PDS), according to a Livemint report.

However, FSSAI had earlier banned Maggi Masala in 2015 saying that the instant noodles was unsafe and hazardous for human consumption after finding lead in excessive levels and presence of taste enhancer monosodium glutamate (MSG).

After a series of test conducted in India and abroad Nestlé’s Maggi was given a clean chit. And the Bombay High Court lifted a government ban on Nestlé’s popular Maggi noodles."

Archit Gupta,

Founder & CEO, ClearTax.com

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on March 27 introduced four bills on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the lower house of Parliament, paving the way for the launch of the landmark tax reform.

While the government is aggressive about rolling out the new tax structure by 1st July, the consumer firms are asking for a wider window to prepare themselves for GST. Some of the bigger giants like Nestle and HUL however, have reported that they started hiring indirect tax experts and IT consultants from last year itself to get ready in advance and avoid the glitches.

The question now is; how well prepared are the consumer firms in general for GST rollout?

Let’s understand how the new tax structure will impact this industry, the challenges posed by the change in tax laws, and how the firms can align their operations with GST rules to make the most efficient use of the resources under the new tax regime.

Challenge: Technological ReadinessThe consumer goods sector includes companies that are involved in food production, packaged products, clothing, electronics etc. The B2C transactions in this sector run into millions on a per day basis which can be handled only by employing ERPs or business process management software that allow the enterprises to manage business. These software also automate many back office functions related to technology, services & human resources.

When GST goes live, the ERP solutions will need to be updated with the new tax law in terms of rate of taxes, type of tax, invoicing, return filing compliance etc.

The way out: Connect with your ERP/business software service provider and evaluate with the help of tax experts if the same system can be configured to adapt to the changes or an upgraded version is available. There are ERP solutions available in the market that come with 100 % configurable taxation module with which GST can be easily implemented in the ERP solution without any patches and service packs.

Challenge: Compliance burdenCompanies will now have to upload three returns every month - by the 10th (details of supplies), 15th (details of purchases) and 20th of the month (details of taxes paid and input credit taken) after a sale happens.

Besides, by the next year end, companies would have to upload annual returns as well, totaling 37 returns each a year.

The compliance requirements for the consumer firms, especially service providers who earlier had to file only two returns - one every six months, is therefore going to increase drastically.

Challenge: Classification of goods and tax rates under GST

GST will consist of a four-tier tax structure of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent. The tax rates for the FMCG industry under GST are likely to be similar to the existing tax incidence as indicated by the government, except for a few products consumed by the middle class like soaps and toothpaste that could be taxed at lower tax rates.

The way out: Goods will be given a HSN code, and services will be allotted a SAC code for easier tax computation. The same needs to be quoted in all tax invoices and tax rates will be determined accordingly. HSN mapping will become a crucial component of tax return filing in the coming days, so it is important that businesses opt for systems that can provide HSN mapping to avoid paying/collecting tax at incorrect rates.

Challenge: Supply Chain management function

Presently, the FMCG companies have warehouses in every state to avoid paying a 2 per cent central sales tax (CST) for inter-state sales of goods and the state-imposed entry charges, octroi, and other taxes. These warehouses often operate at below efficiency levels adding to overall operational cost.

The way out: Unlike CST, the integrated GST (IGST) for inter-state sales will be creditable and this will promote inter-state transactions. These firms will not have to set up multiple warehouses anymore; in fact they can consider consolidation of depots and shutting down some distribution centers.

It is high time the consumer firms reevaluate and realign their current operations in line with GST laws and get ready for the nation’s biggest tax reform since the end of the colonial era. With the correct measures, consumer firms should be able to get on board the GST wagon in no It is high time the consumer firms reevaluate and realign their current operations in line with GST laws and get ready for the nation’s biggest tax reform since the end of the colonial era. With the correct measures, consumer firms should be able to get on board the GST wagon in no time, and reap the benefits of a simplified centralised taxation system."

HCL Technologies

Macquarie says HCL Technologies is its top pick in the large cap Indian IT services space as the company has been striking a good balance between payout and merger & acquisition investment.

On buyback, the brokerage house says without shareholder nod, company can buy back shares up to 10 percent of shareholder equity and with shareholder nod, it can buy back up to 25 percent of shareholder equity.

The company will consider a proposal for buyback of shares on March 20.

Macquarie says return of capital and US visa reforms are two dominant themes for Indian IT sector.

United Spirits

CLSA has downgraded United Spirits to sell post recent run-up, saying regulatory issues continued as Karnataka government raised alcohol taxes on Wednesday.

It feels tax rate hike will lead to a product price hike of 7-8 percent by the company. Hikes are manageable for the company but it leaves little scope for margin-accretive hikes, the brokerage house says.

Hardening in input prices could raise concerns on margins, according to the research firm. Key stock drivers are SC verdict on liquor ban & effective GST, CLSA says.

Karnataka has raised additional excise duties (AED) by 6-16 percent on alcohol from April.

Goldman Sachs says Karnataka government's 5.5 percent VAT removal on alcohol offset up to 16 percent hike in additional excise duty but there was no VAT levied in the off-trade channel.

United Spirits will need to raise prices by 2-4 percent across key brands, it says.

Zee Entertainment

CLSA has a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 580 as the management expects advertising spending to normalise in FY18.

Company's focus is on improving the viewership of flagship channel Zee TV. Sale of sports business will boost pay-out, the brokerage house says.

JSPL

Deutsche Bank has upgraded JSPL to hold with a target price at Rs 112, saying its upgrade premised on improving confidence in steel volume ramp-up.

Steel volume growth and cost savings will drive 90 percent EBITDA growth over FY17-19, it feels.

Bank of Baroda

Deutsche Bank says for Bank of Baroda, the worst of non-performing loan worries is behind and net interest margin pressure will sustain.

FY18 should witness recoveries on asset quality front, it believes. The bank expects 15 percent return on equity by FY19 and the brokerage house is building at 12 percent return on equity in its expectations.

Deutsche has a buy call on the stock with a target price at Rs 205.

Titan Company

Goldman Sachs has increased its target price on the stock to Rs 521 from Rs 496 after it raised FY18-19 EPS estimates by 5-7 percent.

Bharat Electronics

Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on Bharat Electronics with a target price at Rs 1,800 as it has reasonable confidence on company's orders, execution & margin EPS.

The research firm says better execution environment will drive growth on a large opportunity basket. It expects average order inflow run rate of Rs 13,500 crore per year for FY17-19.

Apollo Hospital

The company highlighted that most of its capex budget has been spent and focuses on improving execution. It is confident of further improvement in pharmacy margins.

While maintaining buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,530, CLSA says focus on execution will enable company to improve revenue growth.

Stronger hospital & pharmacy performance will offset losses in new venture, CLSA feels.

Laurus Labs

Citi has initiated coverage on the stock with neutral rating and target price of Rs 580, saying the company has global leadership in high growth APIs and its move to formulations augur well for long-term growth.

The brokerage house believes formulations related expenses will suppress EBITDA margins by 400-500 basis points and valuations are reasonably fair at 22x FY18 EPS estimates.

Financials

CLSA says HDFC remains its top pick in financials segment as the expansion of subsidy scheme by government is positive for housing finance companies.

Housing finance companies should benefit from uplift in credit demand. Subsidy extension on housing loans can bring down interest cost to 4-5 percent, the brokerage house says.

Consumer

Deutsche Bank has upgraded HUL, Colgate and Emami to buy in consumer space.

The brokerage house feels up-stocking by 'trader' wholesale can potentially benefit staples. It sees 15-17 percent potential upside for HUL, Colgate and Emami.

Jubilant Foodworks, Titan Company, ITC, HUL, Nestle and GSK Consumer are top picks in the space."

The company, which had suffered a setback in 2015 after its popular product Maggi noodles was banned, said it has regained the market share in the segment following a re-launch after five months.

""Our business in India grew strongly despite some disruptive impact from demonetisation at the end of the year,"" Nestle said in a statement.

Maggi noodles continued to regain market share, the company said, adding that confectionery also did well with KitKat.

During 2016, Nestle's global sales increased by 0.8 percent to CHF 89.5 billion (USD 89.42).

""Our 2016 organic growth was at the high end of the industry but at the lower end of our expectations. We saw a solid trading operating profit margin improvement and our cash flow grew significantly,"" said Nestle CEO Mark Schneider.

In Asia, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa (AOA) Zone, which includes China, India and Indonesia, among others, had a sales figure of USD 14.49 billion, up 3.2 percent from 2015.

""The zone saw real internal growth and organic growth gain increasing momentum throughout the year, with market shares recovering and almost all markets contributing,"" Nestle said.

However, it also added: ""The effect of an increase in restructuring spend was more than offset by lower one-off costs related to Maggi in India."" In the AOA zone, Maggi also registered a double digit growth in Central and West Africa markets.

""There was double-digit growth in Central and West Africa (including Ghana, C'te d'Ivoire and Nigeria) and in Equatorial Africa (including Angola), with Maggi and Nido doing well,"" it said.

However, in China, Nestle witnessed a double-digit decline as Yinlu affected overall growth.

""Several initiatives to turn around the business are in place and stabilisation is expected in 2017. Dairy (excluding Yinlu) and confectionery grew positively and Nescafe performed well,"" the FMCG heavyweight said.

South East Asia was strong with double-digit growth in Vietnam and Indonesia. Philippines also performed well with high single-digit growth.

""There was also strong growth in Pakistan from dairy, ready-to-drink and other categories,"" it added.

Nestle India had yesterday reported a decline of 8.66 percent in net profit to Rs 167.31 crore for the fourth quarter ended December 2016. However, net sales of the company was up 16.17 percent to Rs 2,261.28 crore."

""Two to four percent reflect the macroeconomic uncertainty ... this is a volatile and still somewhat deflationary environment... we felt this was wise and prudent,"" new Chief Executive Ulf Mark Schneider, who took over on Jan. 1, told reporters at the company's headquarters.

""But I also wanted to express my confidence that we can get back to mid-single-digit growth by 2020,"" he said, adding he expected pricing to improve this year.

Nestle will step up cost savings to boost profitability and replaced its ""Nestle model"" of 5-6 percent underlying sales growth with a new mid-term goal of ""mid-single-digit organic growth and significant structural cost savings by 2020"".

Nestle said it would increase restructuring costs to around 500 million Swiss francs (USD498 million) this year and so expected a stable trading operating profit margin in 2017.

Net profit at the maker of Kitkat chocolate bars and Nescafe instant coffee fell to 8.5 billion francs last year, well short of the average estimate for 9.59 billion francs in a Reuters poll of analysts, hit by a one-off non-cash adjustment to deferred taxes.

Shares in Nestle were indicated to open 2.3 percent lower based on pre-market activity.

Underlying ""organic"" sales growth slowed to 3.2 percent from 4.2 percent in 2015, missing the now outdated target of 5-6 percent growth for the fourth year in a row and also a 3.4 percent average estimate in the Reuters poll.

Growth in emerging markets, previously the growth driver, slowed to 5.3 percent from 7.0 percent a year ago.

Emerging markets spoilt the picture for peer Unilever that last month reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales amid problems in India and Brazil, while Danone said on Wednesday tough conditions in China would endure in 2017."

The market extended losses in afternoon trade, weighed by auto, metals, infra and select banks stocks after pricing in quarterly earnings.

Market valuations are slightly beyond comfort and with no big macro events lined up, a runaway rally is unlikely, says Mahesh Patil of Birla Sun Life AMC.

The fall in broader markets was more compared with benchmarks. The BSE Midcap index shed 1.3 percent and Smallcap lost 1.5 percent on weak breadth.

About four shares declined for every share rising on bourses.

Nestle India shares fell nearly a percent ahead of earnings later today. The packaged food maker's fourth quarter earnings are expected to good year-on-year due to low base but sequential performance may be impacted by demonetisation. Profit is seen rising 24 percent year-on-year to Rs 227.5 crore and revenue may increase 15.5 percent to Rs 2,263 crore in the quarter ended December 2016, according to average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Tata Motors fell further, down nearly 10 percent as hedging losses are likely to continue for next 3-4 quarters. Edelweiss downgraded the stock to hold from buy, with reduced target price at Rs 501 (from Rs 604) after lowering FY17/18 EBIDTA estimates by 35/25 percent to Rs 29,500/38,500 crore to reflect weaker margins.

ICICI Bank, Sun Pharma, Infosys, Maruti Suzuki, Adani Ports and Tata Steel were down 1-4 percent while HDFC Bank, ITC, Reliance Industries and HDFC continued to support the market, up 0.3-0.9 percent."

Result: Chips in those institutional packs were turning soggy and rancid in barely 3 weeks or so. Added disadvantages of paper being torn in the supply chain or ruptured by sharp edges of tortilla chips was a double whammy. Fabrication of Multi-layer Kraft paper packs in itself is an expensive proposition that requires specialised equipment at the converters’ end with prohibitive capital costs. Printing on paper poses further limitations diminishing the aesthetics of the pack. More annoying was the fact that the Multi-layer Kraft Paper Institutional Bags of Net Weight 16 OZ (1 LB) 454g had to be cut open from the top for taking the chips out and leaving the consumer with no option other than consuming all of it in one go with no provision for deferred consumption without spoilage.

All these issues compelled Whole Foods Market to look for alternate packaging solution for their Tortilla Chips, and that’s when they were referred to Uflex.

Whole Foods did not want to create any confusion in the minds of consumers regarding the look and appeal of its tortilla chips packaging. Moreover being the largest seller of organic food in the US, Whole Foods Market quite essentially wanted to give a paper like organic look to the packaging thereby upholding their brand ethos.

The engineers at Uflex with a clear brief from the client designed a three layered; 12.5 micron coated Polyester / 18 micron BOPP (both sides treated) / 35 micron Polyethylene packaging structure as a 3D flat bottom pouch. Polyester provides excellent barrier from oxygen and also exhibits good thermal resistance owing to its melting temperature that is as high as 150-160 degrees Centigrade. BOPP acts as a strong barrier to moisture. Polyethylene (PE) serves as a sealant layer besides imparting strength and sturdiness to the pouch. To impart a paper like organic look, special registered matte coating was applied on the glossy polyester film.

The pouch is reverse printed and the same machine has the facility of carrying out Registered Top Coating either in matte or gloss thereby rendering a transparent window. A see through window is always a great value addition as the consumers always prefer seeing the product packed inside for making an informed buying decision. A concealed Press-To-Close (PTC) pocket zipper has been provided on the front panel of the 3D pouch with a perforated strip for easy opening and protecting the product for deferred use without any fear of spoilage. An important fact that must be noted is that usually pouches have to be cut from the top using scissors or knives in order to retrieve the snack. This can lead to contamination of food and is therefore not advisable. The PTC slider pocket pouch efficiently obviates this shortcoming.



The transformed packaging offers the following clear advantages:

Shelf life of tortilla chips increased to 90 days; Opening the pack is very convenient for the consumers. Small potions can now be taken out from the institutional pack and the pouch could be zipped thereafter for deferred use keeping the quality of chips absolutely intact through the prescribed shelf life; The 3D pouch renders a 360 degree branding canvas to the pack as it has five distinct panels. This further enhances the visibility and aesthetics of the pouch at the Point of Sale (POS).

Talking about the new packaging for Whole Foods Market, Mr. Anup Sachdeva, Joint President Packaging (Global Exports) at Uflex Limited said, “Earlier in December, especially for the Christmas Season we dispatched 1 million new pouches to the co-packer by Air. The new pouches are now on the retail shelves and I am given to understand from the client that the response has been terrific. The matte finished paper-like pouch perfectly lives up to the image and ethos of the organic food packed inside. More importantly the inks that we have used in the converting process are Toluene and MEK free further emboldening the brand image in the organic space. Tortilla is categorized as healthy food and enjoys a huge market in West America. Consumers are quite appreciating the Press to Close (PTC) zipper on the front panel for the great convenience that it brings along with it.

We are getting more and more enquiries from Tortilla and other snacks brands in the United States that are still using conventional paper packaging. We are very hopeful of more business transactions fructifying in the near future.”

Commenting about the success of the metamorphosed packaging of Tortilla Chips for Whole Foods Market, Mr. Ashok Chaturvedi, Chairman and Managing Director, Uflex Limited said, “You will be glad to know that the pouch has been fabricated on a special Quad Seal Machine with a registered PTC/ Slider applicator and perforation facility. This machine has also been indigenously manufactured by our Engineering Business at the Noida Plant. Being an end-to-end multinational flexible packaging materials and solution company we offer immense ease to our clients globally. All their packaging requirements are met under one roof.

Another very important point that I would like to mention over here is that the revamped packaging for Tortilla Chips did not require any new or specialised filling and sealing line at the Co-packer’s end. The erstwhile machine fills and seals the new pouches equally efficiently. Coming to think of it, no additional Capex is a major boon for the Co-packer. I am glad Uflex has been able to deliver Whole Foods Market exactly the packaging that they had been looking for. Adding value to our clients’ business through innovation is our raison d'être and my team is doing that perfectly and infallibly.” About Uflex

The maker of Kitkat and Aero bars said its researchers have found a way using only natural ingredients to change the structure of sugar particles. By hollowing out the crystals, Nestle said each particle dissolves more quickly on the tongue, so less sugar can be used in chocolate.

""Our scientists have discovered a completely new way to use a traditional, natural ingredient,"" the company's chief technology officer, Stefan Catsicas, said in a statement late on Wednesday.

The announcement comes as a global obesity epidemic ramps up pressure on processed food makers to make their products healthier. Nestle and its peers have all been working to reduce sugar, fat and salt, as consumers increasingly opt for fresher, healthier options.

Nestle said it was patenting its findings and would begin to use the faster-dissolving sugar across a range of its confectionery products from 2018.

Nestle is not the first company to experiment with designer molecules.

PepsiCo in 2010 piloted a designer salt molecule that it said would allow it to use less sodium without affecting the taste of its snacks, which include Walkers crisps and Cheetos."

Nestle India's third quarter profit is expected to be at Rs 249 crore against Rs 124 crore in year-ago period, according to analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Earnings on yearly basis will see sharp uptick due to low base in Q2FY16 that impacted due to Maggi controversy and so did not include Maggi numbers. Hence, focus needs to be on sequential improvement.

Analysts expect sequential sales growth of 2 percent. Lower than 2 percent may be considered negative by the street.

Revenue is likely to increase 33 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,314 crore while operating profit may grow 52 percent to Rs 437.3 crore and margin may expand 240 basis points to 18.9 percent in Q2.

The company follows January-December as its financial year.

Other things to watch out for:-Maggi sales is expected at around Rs 380-400 crore for the quarter-Company launched Maggi in new variants – Atta noodles, Oat noodles & Maggi Hot Heads-Performance of non-Maggi portfolio (contributed 80-85 percent of sales)-Revenue may be aided by new product launches: GrekYo Yogurt, Sunrise Insta-Filter Coffee etc.-Commentary on performance of new launches, Maggi market share (Maggi has regained 57 percent of market share post re-launch)-Commentary on recently launched a new chain of branded outlets - Maggi Hot Spot

The stock recovered 40 percent from low of Rs 4990 seen at the time of Maggi controversy."

Nestle became the latest company to be hit by the global slowdown affecting food manufacturers after posting its weakest underlying sales growth in more than a decade.

The Swiss food giant on Thursday cut its outlook for the year, saying it now expected its full-year sales to rise by 3.5 percent after posting an increase of 3.3 percent for the first nine months. It previously said it expected full-year organic sales to rise by around 4.2 percent.

Like other food manufacturers, the maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe soluble coffee has been struggling with price deflation for its products in Europe amid fierce competition among supermarkets and weak commodity prices.

Tough conditions have also persisted in key markets like China and Brazil.

Rivals like Unilever have increased prices to compensate for currency weaknesses in some markets like Britain.

Nestle said it continued to prioritise volume increases in what it described as a soft environment, but saw some improvement in pricing.

""In an environment marked by deflation and low raw material prices, we continued to privilege volume growth,"" Chief Executive Paul Bulcke said in a statement. ""Pricing remained soft but increasing.""

Nestle's 9-month sales rose to 65.51 billion Swiss francs (USD66.19 billion) from 64.86 billion Swiss francs a year earlier, Vevey-based Nestle said. The figure lagged the average analyst estimate of 66.00 billion francs in a Reuters poll.

Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected organic growth -- which strips out the impact of acquisitions and currency swings -- of 3.7 percent.

""Europe looks like it was under pressure during the quarter while China weakness is weighing on Asia despite the recovery in India,"" said analyst Jon Cox at Kepler Cheuvreux.

""The cut in guidance is disappointing although all of the staples companies looked like they have had a tough quarter – they need to find relevance with consumers,"" he added.

Unilever said its underlying sales increased 4.2 percent for the first nine months of 2016, supported by a 2.7 percent rise in pricing, when it published third-quarter results last week, while French rival Danone this week posted a 2.1 increase in sales during its third quarter."
"September 30, 2016 02:37 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/gut-feeling-new-ceo-to-steer-nestle-down-uncharted-health-path-960486.html,"Switzerland's Nestle, the world's largest food company, wants to tune up your guts. Last weekend, it hosted global experts in Playa del Carmen, Mexico for a three-day workshop on the intestinal microbiome to discuss how trillions of bacteria living in the digestive system can impact everything from obesity to depression.

One attendee was Emeran Mayer, a gastroenterologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, whose family ran a German confectionery business, giving him a unique perspective on Nestle's ambitions.

""Food companies have a real opportunity to continue to sell their products and at the same time be responsive to the emerging medical science in this area,"" he told Reuters, highlighting the role played by good bugs, especially in early life.

Using them to cure disease and boost wellness is one of several bets KitKat maker Nestle is making in the field of health and nutritional science, as it seeks to offset slowing sales of traditional processed foods.

Ulf Mark Schneider, a German medical industry veteran, is expected to speed the drive into health-oriented products when he becomes the first Nestle outsider chief executive in nearly a century in January. He will assume direct oversight of the health science business, which currently operates as a standalone unit.

Schneider's hiring from healthcare firm Fresenius signals Nestle's commitment to pioneering the interface of food and medicine, in part by focusing on nascent areas like microbiome therapy, which has potential to boost human health and Nestle's margins.

The concept has already given the world faecal transplants that can cure patients with life-threatening C. difficile infections by replenishing their gut flora with bacteria from a healthy person's stool, delivered via a nasal or rectal tube.

Nestle -- famous for chocolate bars and ice cream -- is aiming for more appetising products. But some long-term investors are queasy about its bets on early, unproven science that is taking the company down a road that has already seen crashes.The hazards were highlighted two months ago when US biotech firm Seres Therapeutics, in which Nestle has invested USD 185 million, said its pill for C. difficile containing spores from good bacteria had failed in a clinical trial.

Seres shares lost three-quarters of their value, dealing a blow to Nestle, its second-biggest shareholder.

""It shows we still don't understand enough about how the microbial community really works,"" said Tim Spector, a professor of genetics at Kings College London. But he added that such trial failures were not unusual with experimental drugs and he remained optimistic about future research.

Seres, which at the time described the results as ""unexpected"" and said it was continuing research efforts, declined to comment further to Reuters.

WHERE'S THE RETURN

Nestle sees its investments as future-proofing its business and carving out a competitive edge with food and drinks fortified by medical technology. It is not becoming a pharmaceuticals company, said its chief financial officer, who spent more than 20 years at the predecessor companies of French pharma giant Sanofi.

""There is no clear line between what is food and beverage on one side and pharma on the other,"" CFO Francois-Xavier Roger told Reuters. ""There are certain areas which are at the frontier of both.""

Nestle has forecast its health science unit to reach annual sales of USD 10 billion, up from around USD 2 billion currently, though it has not said by when.

Roger declined to estimate what Nestle has spent building up its health science unit, which employs now some 3,000 people. But he described the approach as involving modest bets made with a long-term horizon.

""Not all of them will succeed, but most of them will,"" he said, noting such risks were no different than what the food giant did with Nespresso, the first single-serve coffee, which took more than a decade to turn a profit.

Still, there is investor concern that its recent spate of deals, while small, are not yet paying off.

""While we would expect acquisitions to be dilutive in the first two to three years, we expect a recovery thereafter,"" analysts at Bernstein said earlier this month, when downgrading Nestle shares to ""market perform"" from ""outperform"".

""There is currently no sign of this at Nestle,"" they said.

Nestle's return on invested capital (ROIC) has fallen to 10.9 percent in 2015 from 15.5 percent in 2010.

""That's not what you're supposed to be doing,"" said fund manager Ali Miremadi of GAM Holding, a Nestle shareholder. If that decline continues, he said Nestle risks losing its position as the keystone consumer goods investment in Europe to Unilever.

Unilever, which has also been on an acquisition spree, had a ROIC of 18.9 percent last year.

Regardless of the financial returns, academic investment in the microbiome is booming, with 8,800 scientific papers published in leading journals since 2006, half of them in the last two years, according to the Web of Science, a Thomson Reuters database.

And the US government endorsed the field in May by launching a National Microbiome Initiative with a combined federal agency investment of more than USD 121 million in 2016 and 2017.

""The microbiome is one of the hottest areas in medicine right now but we're only at the tip of the iceberg in terms of understanding host-microbe interactions and how diet can be such a modifying influence,"" said John Cryan of Ireland's University College Cork.

He and colleagues recently published a paper called ""Transferring the blues,"" showing that feeding gut bacteria from humans with depression reproduced depressive behaviour in rats.

CORPORATE COMPETITION

Other corporations are looking on hungrily, too. French food firm Danone, the world's biggest yogurt maker, has long championed probiotics, live bacteria that can be added to food for their health benefits.

One of its biggest products, Activia yogurt, boasts a particular bacterial culture it says has a beneficial effect on digestion. Several years ago it faced class action lawsuits related to the accuracy of health claims it had been making on Activia and DanActive.

The case exposed a big challenge facing companies hoping to carve out a new business between food and medicine: regulation.

So far, Nestle and its rivals have concentrated mainly on dietary supplements, which can get to market far more quickly than pharmaceuticals requiring lengthy clinical trials.

But in future Nestle wants to invent products that are closer to scientifically proven medicines, while still potentially coming in the form of a tasty snack or drink.

Regulators are wary, however, having been criticised in the past for allowing unjustified claims for some fortified and functional foods, sales of which reached USD 258 billion in 2015, according to Euromonitor.

Another Nestle-backed company, US biotech firm Accera, was issued a warning in 2013 by US health regulators over claims related to its Axona drink for Alzheimer's patients.

Despite potential bumps in the road, long-time Nestle shareholder, Thomas Russo of Gardner Russo & Gardner, believes Nestle's move into health is a good one, as long as it doesn't stray too far from its core business.

""The benefit that comes from this is not just the revenues that come from Nestle Health Science, it's the work that's done through it to make the core products better for you,"" Russo said. ""It really surfaces throughout the entire offering."""
"September 01, 2016 01:07 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/nestle-to-buy-medical-device-company-phagenesisstages-967962.html,"Nestle announced a deal on Thursday to buy Phagenesis, a British medical device company working on a new treatment for dysphagia, a condition where patients are unable to swallow safely.

Nestle Health Science will make an undisclosed upfront payment, followed by milestone-based funding, while Phagenesis completes evaluation of its Phagenyx device that uses electrical stimulation to help sufferers regain control of swallowing.

The acquisition will be based on successful completion of European and U.S. development programmes anticipated by 2019, Nestle said.

The deal is the latest acquisition by Nestle in the medical sphere as the Swiss food giant increasingly refocuses its business on the area between food and pharmaceuticals.

With estimated sales of about 4 billion Swiss francs (USD4.1 billion) out of Nestle's total 88.8 billion francs in 2015, the health business is seen as faster growing and more profitable than Nestle's traditional food and beverage operations, which include Nescafe instant coffee and KitKat chocolate bars.

Analysts say growth in the business was 7.6 percent in 2015, compared with a 4.2 percent rate for the group as a whole, while Nestle is aiming to lift annual sales of health products to as high as 10 billion francs.

Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle has also recruited Ulf Mark Schneider from German healthcare group Fresenius as its next chief executive to spearhead its growth in this area.

Analysts said the Phagenesis deal showed Nestle's determination to expand in the sector with acquisitions.

""It could be the start of many more to come,"" said Jon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux. ""Nestle has made a clear statement of intent with the appointment of Ulf Mark Schneider to become CEO that it will develop its health and nutrition business.""

Phagenesis, based in Manchester, said the investment would enable it to accelerate the development of Phagenyx, a device that restores the neurological control of swallowing by 'kick-starting' the re-organisation of the brain with an electrical signal.

The condition particularly affects stroke patients and can lead to life-threatening complications, including aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition and dehydration."

Faced with more demanding consumers asking for fresh, healthy products, makers of packaged foods are reformulating recipes, cutting sugar, salt and fat or, a path chosen by Nestle, seek solace in higher-margin ""premium"" products and health foods.The maker of Kitkat chocolate bars and Maggi noodles confirmed its full-year outlook after ""organic"" sales growth -- adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and currency swings -- slowed to 3.5 percent in the first half, below the average estimate of 3.8 percent in a Reuters poll of analysts.

Schneider will replace Nestle's long-standing CEO Paul Bulcke, whom the board has proposed as chairman when 71-year-old Peter Brabeck-Letmathe hits mandatory retirement age next year.

Nestle's appointment of Schneider, a US-German dual citizen, marks the company's first external hire for the CEO job in nearly a century.

""This is a truly iconic global company with a proud heritage and tremendous future prospects,"" Schneider, 50, said in a statement released after the market close.

Earlier in June, Brabeck hinted the company could be eyeing external candidates for the CEO role, although many analysts and shareholders still expected it to continue its tradition of promoting internally.

Nestle's best-known goods range from baby food to coffee and chocolate, but it has been investing more recently in higher-margin, higher-growth healthcare products as it tries to fend off criticism that its scale stifles agility.

It has signed a series of deals with small companies in its bid to create a new kind of business that is midway between food and pharmaceuticals. The goal is to find new ways to treat, diagnose and prevent a range of diseases, from gastrointestinal problems to Alzheimer's.

Nestle said the board had appointed Schneider with the long-term orientation of the company in nutrition, health and wellness and full the integration of its health science and skin health divisions in mind.

Both divisions will report directly to the CEO from Jan. 1.

Known as a hard worker who enjoys great respect within the industry, Schneider grew Fresenius through a series of deals, increasing sales fourfold and net income twelvefold during his 13 years at its helm.

""He has led Fresenius through a period of exciting and sustainable growth and has truly transformed the company,"" Fresenius Chairman Gerd Krick said in a statement announcing Schneider's resignation on Sunday. ""While we regret his departure we wish him the very best for his future endeavors.""

When burning the midnight oil, Schneider has been known to consume nutritional drinks made by Fresenius's hospital nutrition unit Kabi to get himself going again.

He will assume the role of chief executive at Nestle at the start of 2017 after an introductory period with the company beginning in September.

Bulcke, who has led the company since 2008, will resign at the end of 2016 to respect a mandatory cooling-off period before standing for election as chairman at Nestle's annual general meeting on April 6, 2017.

While the CEO runs the company, the chairman provides strategic guidance. Nestle's last four chiefs, whose collective CEO tenure lasted 40 years, all became chairmen."

The Swiss group will pay DBV Technologies 10 million euros upfront for rights to its skin patch test for cow’s milk protein allergy, with the balance depending on successful development, the two companies said on Tuesday.

The deal with the Franco-American company underscores Nestle's ambitions for its Health Science division, which it believes could eventually generate more than 10 billion Swiss francs (USD10 billion) in annual sales.

Nestle has signed a series of similar deals with other small companies in its bid to create a new kind business that is midway between food and pharmaceuticals. The goal is to find new ways to treat, diagnose and prevent a range of diseases, from gastrointestinal problems to Alzheimer's.

An allergy to cow's milk is common in babies and young children and Nestle sees a significant market for an simple diagnostic tool.

Under the terms of the agreement DBV will be eligible to receive up to 90 million euros in development, regulatory and commercial milestones - on top of the upfront payment - and will also collect royalties on eventual product sales.

The new test will need to go through extensive clinical trials before it is cleared for sale and DBV expects it to be submitted for approval to regulators worldwide by 2021.

Nestle Health Science, which employs around 3,000 people, is an expanding part of the Swiss group's operations.

Given ageing populations around the world and spiralling cases of lifestyle diseases, Nestle sees big opportunities in health - but the initiative also poses new challenges, since it takes Nestle into the highly regulated medical field.

Strategically the shift towards health offers Nestle a hedge against slowing growth in packaged foods and may also offset crackdowns on unhealthy foods blamed for obesity and other lifestyle problems.

For DBV the deal is a vindication of its Viaskin patch technology. The company also has another test for peanut allergy in clinical trials, as well as an earlier-stage programme for egg allergy.

Business Wire IndiaKeeping its promise to progressively contribute towards a cleaner and greener planet, India’s largest global flexible packaging solution company Uflex has rolled out natural resource conservation initiatives in partnership with Fiinovation - a technical research based consulting organization and AROH Foundation - a leading civil society organization, acclaimed for its work in social development and environmental restoration.



Natural Resource Conservation and Optimization initiatives will entail sustained engagement in four villages of Gautam Buddha Nagar District with an overarching aim to build the capacity of the community to conserve and optimize the natural resource base. This would involve a construction of carefully planned in-situ and ex-situ rainwater harvesting structures that include field bunds and farm ponds to arrest rain water, organic and inorganic mulching to protect soil cover and plantation drive.



Horticulture species shall be grown in the community and individually owned land which shall provide fodder for the livestock all year round while also supplementing the farmers’ income by bearing fruits.



Over a period of 3 years, around 400 farmers will stand to benefit from the programme that has just been rolled out. The structured engagement that involves participation of all stakeholders like village panchayat, farmers, local administration and social workers will result in improvement of ground water level due to percolation; better availability of water for domestic and agricultural use; reduced soil erosion and overall enhancement of the air and water quality leading to improved health quotient of village inhabitants.



Soon after launching the interventions, Mr. Ashok Chaturvedi, Chairman & Managing Director, Uflex Limited in an official statement said, “Uflex accords very high value to socio-environmental responsiveness. With the cooperation of all stakeholders who have pledged their support for this initiative, we are very optimistic for bringing about tangible changes for rejuvenating the eco-system of the villages that we are working in. Uflex will document the good practices thus evolved so that these interventions could be scaled up and replicated by others for the larger good of mother earth.”

Business Wire IndiaKeeping its promise to progressively contribute towards a cleaner and greener planet, India’s largest global flexible packaging solution company Uflex has rolled out natural resource conservation initiatives in partnership with Fiinovation - a technical research based consulting organization and AROH Foundation - a leading civil society organization, acclaimed for its work in social development and environmental restoration.



Natural Resource Conservation and Optimization initiatives will entail sustained engagement in four villages of Gautam Buddha Nagar District with an overarching aim to build the capacity of the community to conserve and optimize the natural resource base. This would involve a construction of carefully planned in-situ and ex-situ rainwater harvesting structures that include field bunds and farm ponds to arrest rain water, organic and inorganic mulching to protect soil cover and plantation drive.



Horticulture species shall be grown in the community and individually owned land which shall provide fodder for the livestock all year round while also supplementing the farmers’ income by bearing fruits.



Over a period of 3 years, around 400 farmers will stand to benefit from the programme that has just been rolled out. The structured engagement that involves participation of all stakeholders like village panchayat, farmers, local administration and social workers will result in improvement of ground water level due to percolation; better availability of water for domestic and agricultural use; reduced soil erosion and overall enhancement of the air and water quality leading to improved health quotient of village inhabitants.



Soon after launching the interventions, Mr. Ashok Chaturvedi, Chairman & Managing Director, Uflex Limited in an official statement said, “Uflex accords very high value to socio-environmental responsiveness. With the cooperation of all stakeholders who have pledged their support for this initiative, we are very optimistic for bringing about tangible changes for rejuvenating the eco-system of the villages that we are working in. Uflex will document the good practices thus evolved so that these interventions could be scaled up and replicated by others for the larger good of mother earth.”

The new regulations by the Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is aimed at brining in more clarity in the quality standards, sources said.

This will be the first time that FSSAI would come up with quality standards specifically for instant noodles. So far, there have been one common standard for various kinds of ready-to-cook products including noodles.

The new norms would clearly set the permissible limits of Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) and Ash content and also state the specific standards for taste maker, a key ingredient in the instant noodles, sources said.

Earlier on April 1, the FSSAI had asked state authorities to launch proceedings against only those noodle or pasta companies that taste-enhancer monosodium glutamate (MSG) in their products despite carrying 'No MSG' or 'No added MSG' label on the packets.

Glutamate is naturally found in some common foods such as milk, spices, wheat, vegetables, etc.

Presently there is no analytical method to determine whether MSG was added to the product during manufacturing or it was naturally present in the product. This can however be checked through inspection of manufacturing premises.

In June last year, FSSAI had banned Nestle's Maggi noodles over allegations of high lead content and presence of MSG.

The Bombay High Court however later lifted the nationwide ban imposed by Indian food regulators on Maggi noodles, and asked Nestle India to go for a fresh test of samples in three independent laboratories across India.

Nestle re-launched Maggi noodles in Indian markets in November 2015."

Business Wire IndiaAt a time when flexible packaging is immaculately shaping the contours of the FMCG industry world over, bringing much ease, benefits and convenience to the end users, Uflex has been honored with the Power Brands Rising Star Award 2016. Notably, Uflex is India’s largest global flexible packaging solution company enjoying a formidable market presence in over 140 countries.

The Indian flexible packaging industry has been growing at 15-17 % annually over the past five years or so. Globally the industry is growing at 4.5-5% annually. Consumer Goods industry is the biggest user of flexible packaging but still remains quite under penetrated in India when compared globally. Estimated 20-25% consumer goods are sold in packaged form. With the improving economic environment and demand from consumer goods industry, the domestic packaging industry has a potential to grow at more than 20% annually here onwards. Flexible packaging is thus among the most promising and fastest growing sectors in India.

Planman Media – a name synonymous to fearless, analytical, sharp and insightful journalism, through its ‘Power Brand Rising Stars’ platform recognizes promising brands that have shown sustained growth over the past and have been able to create a huge impact etching a strong impression to ‘elevate’ and capture the imagination of a resurgent India.

The award was conferred at a scintillating ceremony held in the Capital presided over by Dr. Najma A. Heptulla Hon’ble Union Minister of Minority Affairs with the bigwigs of India Inc. in attendance.

Mr. Ashok Chaturvedi, Chairman and Managing Director, Uflex Limited in an official statement said “Flexible packaging has ushered FMCG brands within the reach of the common thereby justifying the adjective ‘flexible’ in its truest sense. Besides addressing affordability, flexible packaging has immense potential to offer enhanced aesthetics, optimum barrier properties for prolonged shelf life, improvised pack functionalities, environment-friendly alternatives w.r.t rigid packaging and unparalleled brand protection in terms of anti-counterfeiting features that keep look-alikes at bay. I am glad that Uflex has been ‘The Pioneer’ in bringing the Flexible Packaging experience in India. Our capability to provide end-to-end flexible packaging solutions globally blended with a strong conviction to consistently innovate and create value-added differentiation for our clients has been driving us and shall continue to drive us in setting new benchmarks. Flexible packaging industry is indeed a Rising Star that offers sky full of great possibilities, and Uflex is truly humbled and inspired for being honored as the Power Brand in this category.”

Like its peers, Nestle has had to deal with slower growth and more demanding consumers in emerging markets, notably China, while sales in India have been dented by a Maggi noodle recall.

""We anticipate that our trading environment in 2016 will be similar to previous years with even softer pricing,"" the maker of Nescafe instant coffee and Pure Life bottled water said in a statement on Thursday.

""As such we expect to deliver organic growth in line with 2015, with improvements in margins and underlying earnings per share in constant currencies, and capital efficiency.""

Net profit at the group based in Vevey on Lake Geneva fell to 9.1 billion Swiss francs (USD9.19 billion), lagging the average estimate of 9.98 billion francs in a Reuters poll. It had of a one-off gain linked to L'Oreal and Galderma in 2014.

The company, whose brands span from KitKat chocolate bars to Gerber baby food, proposed raising its dividend to 2.25 francs from 2.20 francs a year ago, in line with market expectations.

At 4.2 percent underlying ""organic"" sales growth -- which is adjusted for currency swings, acquisitions and divestitures -- in the full year was in line with the nine-month period, making 2015 the third year in a row where growth fell short of the group's 5-6 percent long-term target that was not mentioned in the earnings statement."

The IAAF is in turmoil following widespread allegations of corruption and bribery.

""This decision was taken in light of negative publicity associated with allegations of corruption and doping in sport made against the IAAF,"" Nestle said in a statement.

""We believe this could negatively impact our reputation and image and will therefore terminate our existing agreement with the IAAF, established in 2012.""

Nestle had a partnership with the IAAF Kids Athletics programme.

""The IAAF is in discussion with Nestle concerning the final year of its five-year partnership with IAAF Kids’ Athletics,"" the IAAF said in a statement.

""This has been a successful programme with 15 million kids aged 7 to 12 years in 76 countries taking part in fun team activities which promotes a healthy, active life style.""

An independent commission of the World Anti-Doping Agency has stated in a report that ""corruption was embedded"" at the organisation.

The report said that a clique run by former IAAF president Lamine Diack covered up organised doping and blackmailed athletes while senior officials looked the other way.

Diack is under formal investigation in France on suspicion of corruption and money-laundering linked to concealing positive drug tests, in concert with Russian officials.

Sebastian Coe, the British former 1,500 metres Olympic champion, took over as IAAF President last year with the aim of cleaning up the organisation, but the loss of the Nestle partnership is another major blow.

“Angered and dismayed by today’s kids’ athletics announcement. We will not accept it. It’s the kids who will suffer,” Coe said.

German sportswear company Adidas AG will also end its sponsorship deal with the IAAF almost four years early, the BBC reported last month.

Share Market Live NSE

Sales dropped 2.1 percent to 64.9 billion Swiss francs (USD 68 billion) in the nine months through September, missing analysts' average forecast of 65.9 billion in a Reuters poll.

Organic or underlying growth, adjusted for currency swings, acquisitions and divestitures, slowed to 4.2 percent in the period from 4.5 percent in the first half, sliding further behind its 5 percent target for 2015.

The company cut its 2015 outlook to around 4.5 percent, below its long-term model calling for 5 to 6 percent growth.

""The shortfall comes from pricing, as Nestle does not seem to have been able to pursue its pricing actions as hoped, and more importantly the issue seems to be again the Asia, Oceania, Australia region, with sales down in the third quarter,"" Barclays analysts wrote in a note.

Chief Executive Paul Bulcke said: ""After a good performance in the first half of the year, we were impacted in the third quarter by exceptional events, with Maggi noodles in India and a rebate adjustment in Nestle Skin Health.""

Maggi noodles were subject to a recall in India over safety concerns.

In the United States, frozen food sales began improving after a revamp of Nestle's Lean Cuisine brand, but this contrasted with lagging sales in China, which showed a slower sales recovery, Bulcke said. India's Maggi noodle recall continued to have a significant impact on growth in the South Asia Region, Nestle said.

In its Skin Health division, Nestle's US prescription drug rebates exceeded what it had set aside for this purpose, resulting in an additional one-off charge in the third quarter.

Despite prospects that Europe's hot summer would have consumers grabbing ice cream out of freezers, sales at the group's milk products and ice cream unit fell 350 million francs year-on-year to 11 billion. Water, however, achieved 7.1 organic growth through September, second only to confectionery at 7.8 percent.

Nestle earlier this month confirmed it was in advanced talks to merge its international ice cream business with R&R Ice Cream, in its latest effort to refocus on other, higher-performing brands and advance its goal of becoming a ""nutrition, health and wellness"" company.

Unilever, the global number one in ice cream, on Thursday posted third-quarter underlying sales up 5.7 percent, thanks in part to a strong summer. But the Anglo-Dutch group said it expected sluggish global markets to keep weighing on performance."

Alleging bias, Nestle India Limited today told the apex consumer commission that it was being ""singled out"" by the government in the Maggi noodles ban case as no action was being taken against other manufacturers of similar products. Citing Bombay High Court order which had set aside the countrywide ban on Maggi, the company also sought to recall an earlier order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) by which it had admitted government's Rs 640 crore suit against the noodles manufacturer for alleged unfair trade practices and other charges. A bench, headed by Justice V K Jain, issued notice to the government on the company's plea and sought response by October 8.

It also issued notice to Nestle on a separate plea filed by the government seeking further testing of Maggi noodles. The company opposed the government's suit saying that due to the ban, around 9,000 vendors and 10,000 suppliers were rendered unemployed and it has suffered a loss of nearly Rs 250 crore. ""It has caused a huge damage to our reputation... to the extent that my competitors are making fun of me (company). While my product has been banned, government is not taking any action against any manufacturer of similar products... I am being singled out,"" senior advocate Arvind Nigam said on behalf of the company.

On August 17, NCDRC had issued notice to Nestle on the government's suit to which the company had to reply today. However, the company failed to reply to the notice claiming that it has not received complete documents from the government to which it had to filed its reply."

Drugmaker Abbott Healthcare is challenging West Bengal's accusation that a sample of the company's cough syrup contained excessive levels of codeine, the second multinational to question India's regulatory testing regime in recent months.

Whether the sample of Abbott's popular ""Phensedyl"" was a genuine product or a fake has not been established, but the suspect batch of 80,000 bottles has not been recalled.

The state laboratory in West Bengal first raised the alarm last November.

The previously unreported case underlines the weakness of India's unwieldy and poorly resourced drug and food regulatory system, the uncertainty it creates for foreign and domestic companies operating there and the potential risk to consumers.

Abbott Healthcare is a unit of US-based Abbott Laboratories. Abbott Laboratories also has a listed subsidiary in India, Abbott India Ltd.

Three months ago, Nestle was forced to withdraw its Maggi instant noodles from Indian shelves because the food safety authority banned the snack after its tests showed excess lead.

A court later overturned the ban in a partial victory for the Swiss food giant, but the allegations hurt the company's reputation and that of the country's regulators, who operate with few staff and poorly equipped facilities.

In the latest dispute, the laboratory found that a sample of Phensedyl contained more than twice the labelled amount of codeine, according to several state drug officials and correspondence between regulators and Abbott seen by Reuters.

Phensedyl sales are estimated to be more than 3 percent of Abbott's USD 1 billion India revenue. The sales are dwarfed by Abbott's global annual sales of over USD 20 billion, but, as the Nestle case shows, fallout from safety scandals is unpredictable.

The excessive codeine, an opium derivative, would violate Indian drugs law. It triggered a ""show cause"" notice against Abbott, which was sent in March by the drug regulator in Himachal Pradesh, where Phensedyl is manufactured.

In its response in late April, Abbott denied the allegations and urged regulators to not take any action. Abbott said it had found nothing unusual in its own and third party testing of a retained sample from the same batch of Phensedyl.

The company also asked regulators to give it more information about the source of the suspect sample and the manner in which it was collected, so that it could establish whether it was genuine and proper process was followed.

""We are awaiting response from the authorities,"" the company said in answer to Reuters questions.

DRUG SEIZURE

The original test was carried out by West Bengal after Phensedyl bottles were seized near the border with Bangladesh, said Samit Saha, a state drug inspector involved in the case.

Codeine-based cough syrups are banned in Bangladesh, and smuggling is rife as people profit from higher prices there compared to India.

According to a copy of the inspector's report, the sample contained 21.37 mg of codeine per 5 ml dosage, instead of 10 mg specified on the label.

Saha said two other samples from different batches, however, showed normal codeine levels.

Excessive consumption of cough syrup with high levels of codeine can lead to health implications such as sedation, behavioral changes and drug dependence, said Amitabh Parti, a doctor at Fortis Memorial Research Institute.

In February, West Bengal listed the potentially tainted batch as ""not of standard quality"" in a monthly publication.

The bulletin, which is posted on the regulator's website, is supposed to alert consumers and pharmacies in the state to suspect drugs. But the West Bengal drug controller, CM Ghosh, said he does not have the resources to follow it up.

STATES OF CONFUSION

Navneet Marwaha, the drug controller in Himachal Pradesh, said in an interview that Phensedyl, which accounts for about a third of the Indian cough syrup market, is often copied by counterfeiters. He said Abbott's stocks of codeine were accounted for.

""They (Abbott) are saying 'show us the sample so we can see whether it is genuine.' They have not been provided with the sample,"" Marwaha said.

He added that it was up to West Bengal to provide the information to Abbott.

West Bengal's Ghosh said it was Himachal Pradesh's prerogative and the company can only challenge the test's findings at a central government drug lab with a court's permission.

Safety breaches and scares are common in India. According to a 2012 parliamentary report, nearly one in 22 locally produced drug samples is of sub-standard quality in India.

India has just 1,500 drug inspectors responsible for more than 10,000 factories, supplying medicines for a population of 1.2 billion and exporting to nearly 200 countries.

Ghosh said he has 140 drug inspectors to monitor more than 50,000 pharmacies in the state.

The central government wants to improve regulation of the key sector, and plans to spend USD 263 million in the next three years to strengthen the national and state regulatory system with additional equipment and staff and new laboratories."

The Union consumer affairs ministry’s decision to launch a class action suit against Nestle, makers of Maggi noodles, in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) will be an important test case for such actions in the future.

However, it is in the best interests of the regulators, Nestle and consumers to come to a compromise solution rather than litigate endlessly.

Nestle was forced to withdraw its Maggi stocks from all over the country in June this year following the discovery of lead above acceptable levels in some samples, and a label that said “No added MSG”. While tests of Maggi noodles sent outside the country to Singapore, Canada and the US appear to have passed their more stringent food safety tests, Nestle’s real battleground is India, where it is contesting the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India’s (FSSAI’s) order and claims that Maggi can be hazardous to health.

The class action suit, which seeks Rs 640 crore in damages from Nestle on behalf of consumers, has two dimensions – one positive, and the other negative. The positive one is the message it sends out about stronger government action on food safety standards. But this will be credible only if the government follows up the action against Nestle with similar actions involving other food products. Also, class action suits have not had a track-record in India; the suit by the ministry may thus be a shot in the dark.

The negative dimension is the possibility that the government may have chosen to make its point with the wrong company – a multinational that is normally known to follow higher standards than domestic producers. It can have implications for how foreign companies view India as a fair and safe place to do business in.

It is possible that the class action suit launched by the consumer affairs ministry was intended to pressure Nestle to settle the case out of court so that there is no inordinate delay in the reintroduction of a suitably relabelled and reformulated Maggi.

The salutary effects of the action against Maggi are already visible in the area of milk, where the FSSAI and milk cooperatives have agreed to increase checks and quality standards for milk delivered. According to this Business Standard report, the FSSAI and representatives of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) have agreed to implement better quality checks and the government testing facilities needed to enforce those standards.This is critical, for the key element in ensuring quality is not just the care taken by food manufacturers at their end, but the quality of the testing facilities available with the regulators in states and the FSSAI. Nestle, for example, has raised doubts about the accuracy of FSSAI’s testing laboratories. Despite failing tests in some labs in India, Maggi jumped over the hurdles in Singapore, USA and Canada.Since it cannot be anyone’s claim that India’s food safety standards, regulation and supervision are better than that of the US, Canada and Singapore, the class action suit seems more like an effort to push Nestle to compromise in order to spare our regulator the blushes in case Nestle gets the courts to lend it a more sympathetic ear.However, the negative fallout of trying to pressure Nestle is that no one outside India will believe that the regulatory process here is fair and transparent. This will damage the country’s efforts to tell the world that we are a safe place to do business in.The concurrent agreement reached with the NDDB will also suggest that when it pleases the regulator and government, deals will be done in consultation with industry.Is there a way out for the FSSAI, the government and Nestle? The only answer is a compromise where Nestle is allowed to restart production and marketing of Maggi after proper testing and reformulation of its products, and a simultaneous agreement between the two on how the products will be inspected and tested in future, and with what equipment.The real problem of food safety lies not in our laws, but in our inability to create enough testing systems with adequate manpower to do the job consistently and fairly. We do not have a regulator who can regulate effectively. As a result, it is the oddball result – as in the case of Maggi – that is seen as a great achievement.

As this writer has noted before, Indian food is largely unsafe for human consumption. Toxic food is sold everywhere, from contaminated milk to fruits and vegetables that bear an overdose of pesticides, to bhujias and junk food that are simply unhealthy for all people, leave alone kids.Nowhere is the problem worse than in the case of milk – a product fundamental to Indian children’s health, especially those born in vegetarian families. Many producers and distributors adulterate milk to increase profits and to make the product look thick. In Maharashtra, the Food and Drug Administration found that 24 percent of the samples tested in Pune division some time back were either unsafe or did not conform to the standards set by FS&SAI. But we continue to drink this poison in the name of health.

Some diaries inject hormones or insulin into buffaloes because this helps make the milk thicker. But insulin also gets into the milk, which makes it unsafe for women and children. In Andhra Pradesh, milk samples tested by a private laboratory found traces of urea, coliform, e-coli and salmonella (many of them harmful bacteria), but the milk diaries faced no action. Unlike Maggi, which is being withdrawn at huge cost, how many milk producers have been ordered to throw their milk away because it is sub-standard?

And it isn’t about milk alone. The New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment found that junk food – like burgers and bhujias – contains high levels of trans-fats (very harmful), salt and sugar, which could lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and heart disease.

Most ordinary hotel kitchens are unhygienic, and street food is often sold next to gutters and garbage in big cities. Branded Kurkure may be made in hygienic factories, but potato chips and namkeen are often made inside slums or dirty factories, often with low-quality ingredients and oil, in order to sell them cheap. We pay a price in terms of health for buying and consuming “cheap” food.

The short point is this: food and health safety, despite the existence of standards and regulations, is badly in need of strong supervision and enforcement of the law.

The states are the real culprits, as food safety has to be enforced by them. The Maggi problem was discovered by a food inspector in Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh, but the chances are this discovery was an accident or an exception. The reason why bad and unhygienic food goes unchecked is corruption. It is simply too easy for food manufacturers to bribe inspectors and continue doing what they are doing: selling poison for profit. For small food sellers, the cost of complying with the law is simply too high compared with the ease of paying a bribe.

There are only three ways to combat food adulteration. First, the public must be educated on this. Second, packaged food makers and hotels must be sensitised to improve hygiene standards by the use of better technology and safer ingredients. And third, we simply need many thousands of food inspectors and foolproof testing equipment of the highest quality to ensure fair and effective quality standards.

We need quality standards in our testing equipment as much as in our food.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has advised maintaining decorum on the Maggi row till all facts come to light, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said on Thursday, as the government does not want to hurt investment flow. ""Day before yesterday, the Prime Minister had said whatever people say, we should maintain decorum on this issue (Maggi). Until we get the fact findings done, there is no need to create unnecessary noise,"" Paswan said while sharing about the Maggi row at an Assocham event here.

Paswan also favoured setting up a single coordinated body to look into many overlapping issues and expedite issuance of product clearances from various ministries in the food sector. The minister assured the food processing representatives that the government does not intend to impose 'inspector raj' and hurt investment flow in the sector, but at the same time asked them to maintain quality of products and do business in ""honest and transparent"" way. ""The government wants to achieve industrial growth but not at the cost of consumer interest. Products should be of good quality and the industry should ensure this,"" he said. Acknowledging problems in getting product approvals, Paswan said, ""There is a need to constitute a single coordinated body to look into many overlapping issues and expedite issuance of clearances from various ministries and government departments in the food sector."" ""We will write to each and every department and also to the Prime Minister that we need to seriously look into such issues being raised by the industry,"" he said adding that there should be a time-bound redressal to the industries grievances. Paswan said there is a ""media trial"" going on in the Maggi row.

He also spoke about certain labs finding Maggi samples conforming to food safety standards and later regulator FSSAI rejecting those test reports. ""There is public perception (about Maggi). If public perception gets dented even once then it become difficult to control.

These days, media trial is happening in a big way. It had happened in the case of Coca-Cola too,"" he added. Consumers get affected when there are health related issues associated with products, he said, adding that there would be criticism in a Parliamentary democracy when such controversies come to light.

In June, FSSAI had banned Maggi noodles after it found its 30 samples ""unsafe and hazardous"" for human consumption. FSSAI had also said that Nestle violated labelling regulations on taste enhancer 'MSG' and ordered company to submit compliance report on its orders."

Currently, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) comes under the purview of Healthy Ministry. The regulator has been in the news since the start of the Maggi controversy.

""Jharkhand, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh demanded that FSSAI should be governed by the Union Consumer Affairs Ministry and not Union Health Ministry. Other states/UTs supported their demand unanimously,"" Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan told reporters here. He refused however to comment on the demand made by state governments in this regard.

Jharkhand Food Minister Saryu Rai said, ""FSSAI should be part of the Union Food and Consumer Affairs Ministry because the issue is related to food.""

""As part of the efforts to resolve the Maggi noodles issue, Nestle India has on Thursday approached the Bombay High Court raising issues of interpretation of the Food Safety and Standards Act 2011 while seeking a judicial review of the order dated June 6, 2015, passed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Maharashtra and the order dated June 5 passed by FSSAI,"" it said in a filing to BSE.

""At the same time, we are continuing withdrawal of Maggi noodle products. This action will not interfere with this process.""

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issued an order last week banning all variants of Nestle India's Maggi noodles, terming them as ""unsafe and hazardous"" for human consumption.

Nestle India had to recall the product from the market after several states banned the '2-minute' instant food as tests showed it contained taste enhancer MSG (monosodium glutamate) and lead in excess of permissible limits.

The Maharashtra government, too, had banned Maggi noodles after some samples were found to contain lead above the stipulated limit.

""We shall proceed further as per orders that may be passed by the Bombay High Court,"" it added. Nestle was trading 0.44 percent higher at Rs 6,083.35 on BSE on thursday."

From a fundamental perspective, the medium to long-term appeal of Indian equities remains healthy, given structural factors & a much improved policy environment, Iyer said, adding but in the near term, investors will have to continue to contend with positioning, valuations & a feeble recovery.

According to him, policy support will likely have to play a crucial role in arresting the decline and putting a bottom in place. We remain wary of chasing beta as also rural discretionary consumption plays, he said.

Traders body Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has asked the government to direct Nestle to make immediate refunds for recalled stocks of its Maggi noodles .

CAIT has urged Union Health Minister J P Nadda to direct Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to issue instructions to Nestle for immediate payment as it has blocked wholesalers' and retailers' capital for nearly two months.

Nestle has about 4,000 distributors and sub stockists in the country and stocks of Maggi noodles of about Rs 100 crore are said to be in the Indian market which needs to be recalled by Nestle under the directions of FSSAI .

All such stocks are paid up stocks as Distributors and Sub-Stockists have already paid value of the stocks to Nestle, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said.

According to the traders' body, big companies as Nestle usually take payment of supplies made to their respective distributors in advance. It is learnt that Nestle has asked its Distributors & Sub-Stockists to return Maggi in 15 days time and then Nestle will perhaps issue Credit Note in 30 days for the stocks recalled.

In this procedure, the working capital of distributors and sub-stockists is blocked for nearly two months. In all probabilities, Nestle will give other products in lieu of recalled stocks to settle the claims. Therefore, because of lapse of Nestle, supply chain is feeling the heat, CAIT said."

It was a choppy trade on Dalal Street Friday. The market gained 200 points intraday on the Sensex led by short covering but washed out those gains in late trade, dragged by banking & financials, auto and technology stocks. Global weakness also kept sentiment under check.

The 30-share BSE Sensex fell 44.93 points to 26768.49 and the 50-share NSE Nifty declined 15.95 points to 8114.70. However, the broader markets outperformed with marginal gains.

Experts believe the market may remain in a consolidation mode, may hover in a range of 8000-8600 on the Nifty as the sentiment has not improved yet due to delay in economy recovery.

Herald van der Linde of HSBC remained underweight on India. He feels risks to growth are rising and there's limited room for support from rate cuts.

According to him, the delay in the recovery in the investment cycle and poor monsoon expectations will continue to put pressure on earnings.

Jitendra Sriram of HSBC said downside risks will increase if monsoon disappoints.

For the week, the Sensex and Nifty plunged 3.8 percent on fears of delay in rate cut after the Reserve Bank of India raised inflation forecast to 6 percent (from 5.8 percent earlier) for January 2016. Monsoon forecast downgrade and Greece concerns also dampened the investor mood. BSE FMCG index was the biggest loser, down more than 9 percent followed by Bank Nifty, BSE Realty, Pharma and Auto with 5-7 percent loss.

Global equities were under pressure today as Greece market cracked more than 3 percent intraday while France’s CAC and Germany’s DAX fell more than 1 percent. US non-farm payrolls report for May will be closely monitored today as economists expect 2,25,000 non farm payrolls, up slightly from 2,23,000 in April. Asian markets closed mixed with the Shanghai rising 1.5 percent while Hang Seng falling 1 percent.

Back home, the Meteorological Department has declared onset of monsoon over the coast of Kerala today. IMD said the monsoon has further advanced into entire south Arabian Sea and some parts of central Arabian Sea. However, it will hit north western states only after June 25.

Tata Motors declined more than 2 percent post Jaguar Land Rover’s UK sales data in May. ICICI Bank, HDFC, TCS and Axis Bank dragged 1-2 percent.

However, Coal India was the biggest gainer on Sensex, up 4.44 percent after the government said will phase out all linkages for the non-regulated sector over the next 12 months and re-auction them. Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight and hiked target price to Rs 449 per share.

Sun Pharma climbed 2 percent as shareholders approved merger of Sun Pharma Global with company. L&T, ITC, ONGC, NTPC, GAIL and Hero Motocorp gained 1-3 percent.

In the broader space, Nestle ended flat after sharp fall in last few sessions due to Maggi ban. While addressing press conference Global CEO Paul Bulcke today clarified on the Maggi fiasco, saying Maggi noodles are safe and have been trusted over last 30 years.

The Centre will take appropriate action once the test reports of Maggi samples are received from the states, Health Minister J P Nadda on Thursday said.

""The centre had asked the states to take samples of Maggi and send the report by June 1. But as testing of samples takes time, reports from many states have not come yet. We hope to get the reports by this evening and may take appropriate action on the basis of reports,"" he said.

Meanwhile, nineteen samples of Maggi noodles were collected from dealers and manufacturing units in the industrial town of Tahliwal of Himachal Pradesh. Reports are awaited as the food analysis labs in the state did not have enough facility to test the reported lead content in the noodles.

The samples have been sent to the adjoining states. Meanwhile, the sale of Maggi has dropped in the state as people are weary of buying the snack after reports of lead content above permissible limit were found in the Maggi samples, Additional Chief Secretariat, Health, Vineet Chaudhary said.

After Delhi, four more states-Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand--today banned the sale of Maggi noodles, as the popular instant snack came under mounting scrutiny over food safety concerns.

The Uttarakhand government banned the sale of Nestle's instant noodles for three months while in Gujarat the ban will be effective for one month after some samples of the food had failed lab tests, officials said in Dehradun and Gandhinagar."

Taking a ""serious"" note of quality issues related to global giant Nestle's famous noodle brand Maggi, the government has asked the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India to look into the matter.

Besides, a class action suit can be initiated into the matter if a complaint with National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) is filed, Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said on Friday.

Last month, the UP Food Safety and Drug Administration had asked Nestle India to withdraw a batch of Maggi noodles ""which were manufactured in February 2014"" after it found high levels of added MSG, a taste enhancer, in the noodles and lead beyond permissible limits.

Disputing the claim, Nestle India had said: ""The company does not agree with the order and is filing the requisite representations with the authorities.""

""It is a serious issue. We have referred the matter to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Under the current law, FSSAI has the power to take action, including imposing fine and hefty punishment,"" Paswan told reporters on the sidelines of an event here.

There are different authorities to handle different complaints related to different consumer items, FSSAI under the Health Ministry handles food related issues, he added.

Besides FSSAI, the Consumer Affairs Ministry has also asked the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) to take action against FMCG major Nestle India on the Maggi issue.

""It is a serious issue (but) the Commission has limited powers. It cannot take suo moto action. It can file class- action suit only after someone files complaint against the company,"" Paswan said. NCDRC President Justice D K Jain said till now no one has filed a complaint against Nestle related to Maggi.

""Till now, no one has filed any complaint. Somebody has to approach us so that we take class action suit. NCDRC does not have jurisdiction to take suo moto action,"" he said.

Jain further said: ""There is a provision for class action. NCDRC is ready to take action after an NGO or any consumer body files a formal complaint."""

Imagine if someone told you they will give you a loan of over 3 billion euros and they would pay you 0.08% to take the money? Yes instead of you paying them - they would be paying you.

Imagine you are running a business and you want to take a loan for your business. Or let us say you want to buy a new house or a car and need money. Usually you would have to pay interest to take money from the bank, lender or financial institution - but what if someone told you they will give you money and instead of you paying them interest, they will be paying you interest?

How would it sound to you? Most likely you will think it is a scam - right ? or something that will happen only in a fantasy world? It will sound crazy to most people but it is happening. That is what makes the world of business, finance and economics so interesting.

But this is what is happening today in several cases, people and companies are being paid to take money from banks and financial institutions. So if you want to borrow money, you will be paid.

This happened with Nestle, Germany and with people starting individual businesses in Denmark.

Nestle issued bonds at a negative interest rate, Germany got over Euros 3.2 Billion at a negative interest rate, business owners are getting money at negative interest rates. This means investors are giving them money and are assured to lose money instead of making money in terms of interest.

The flips side is that many people now are being charged to keep money in banks, so forget about getting any interest people are being informed by banks in Europe that if they want to keep money they have to pay the bank a fee.

Now the first question that will come in anybody's mind, is how can I get my hands on this money and of course another questions will be why is this happening?

The simple thing is that prices are falling in Europe, it is entering deflation. So if you give Germany money at say a negative interest rate of 0.08% the prices of goods and assets in the country and region will fall by more - by say 1% - thus you make a gain.

This also means there are few safe options and opportunities for businesses in the European region. There are also other factors, such as investors feeling the Euro will strengthen over time and thus even though they may get negative interest rates, they will make gains through currency appreciation. So what happens when people are paid to borrow money and people are charged to save money. Well if this continues people will end up removing money from banks, they will try to buy things that will appreciate like Gold or maybe simple keep cash with themselves in Europe.

People will borrow, but if home prices are falling and businesses are losing money they will not be encouraged to start businesses.

Another thought is people can borrow this money and use it in other emerging economies, where they can make higher returns. Here again the risk that comes in is if the currency of the emerging economy weakens against the Euro - then again the investor/entrepreneur loses money.

With everything in life a few risks come in, it is our knowledge and intuition that guides us to make the best decisions.

These are interesting times for Europe, so on one hand Greece, Spain and Italy are facing economic challenges. Greece is borrowing money, other economies like Germany, Denmark and Switzerland are having negative interest rates.

But my question to you is, would you like to be paid to borrow money? What would you do with it if you were in Europe now?

Keep thinking, smiling and making the most of this lovely life we have!

"February 17, 2015 02:19 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/all-eyeschocolate-maker-ferreros-next-generation-1223219.html,"The death of Italian billionaire Michele Ferrero could ultimately herald a deal involving the chocolate empire bearing his name, with the family's third generation leading it into a future of increasingly hungry multinationals.

The maker of Nutella spread and Ferrero Rocher chocolates has long been viewed as an appetising target for rivals such as Mondelez International, Nestle, Mars and Hershey. But given the strength of its brands, the high margins on chocolate and sluggishness of packaged food overall, the Italian business could feasibly be on the shopping list of any global food company.

""Certainly there's more chance of a deal now than there was before; that absolutely must be true,"" said Andrew Cosgrove, EY's global lead analyst on consumer goods. ""It was widely rumoured that no deal would happen until this event.""

Ferrero International, a conservative and secretive 69-year-old company, has largely shied away from the dealmaking that has marked the consumer goods sector's search for growth over the past decade.

But that could change, insiders say. Sources familiar with the company say that Ferrero had once considered a move on Cadbury but pulled back after the family patriarch rejected a push by his sons. Similarly, there were reports in 2013 that it held talks about a takeover by Nestle.

""The idea of a tie-up with Nestle could come back,"" a Ferrero manager told Reuters on condition of anonymity. ""Giovanni (Ferrero, the CEO) always says the company is big but does not have critical mass to really be an international player, so sooner or later he could announce an acquisition. It was the father who blocked everything.""

Other sources also said Ferrero could turn acquisitive to balance its portfolio, noting that it had considered buying United Biscuits and US chocolate company Russel Stover, which ended up going to Swiss rival Lindt & Spruengli.

Apart from Western confectionery groups, Ferrero could also attract the attention of Turkey's Ulker Biskuvi, Korea's Lotte or private equity firms such as 3G Capital, which teamed up with Warren Buffett to buy Heinz.

DEAL BREAKERS?

Giovanni Ferrero, the son who took over sole leadership in 2011 after older brother Pietro died suddenly, would need a majority of shares to give him a stronger hand in any mooted change of course, the manager said.

A Ferrero spokesman, meanwhile, said nothing would change.

""The company is not listed and ownership is all in the family,"" the spokesman said, adding that he did not know details of Michele's will, nor how his shares would be distributed.

Some analysts have expressed doubts, too, pointing out that more than half of Ferrero's sales come from Western Europe, where economic weakness has curbed growth, while many food companies have been looking to push into healthier products.

MainFirst Bank analysts estimate that Ferrero could fetch between 16 billion euros (USD 18.2 billion) and 20 billion euros, based on annual sales of 8 billion euros and the multiples in recent chocolate deals. Accounts to August 2013 report EBITDA of 1.3 billion euros.

But for all the hungry predators and investor speculation, external moves to change the status quo face a large stumbling block in the powerful emotional ties in a family business that has fostered great mutual respect between its owners and staff.

The company began in 1946 when Michele's parents transformed an Alba pastry shop into a factory. It has more than 30,000 employees across more than 20 countries and holds almost 8 percent of the global chocolate market.

Yet it is still held dear in its home town of Alba, where it commands the loyalty of 3,000 employees with practices such as company buses that transport workers from remote villages and the award in 2014 of a 6,000 euro bonus spread over three years.

""We are confident Ferrero will continue on the same path,"" Alba's mayor, Maurizio Marello, told Reuters.

Others who know the family were even stronger in their assertions. ""There is a less than zero chance they will sell,"" said one who asked to remain anonymous."

Emkay's report on FMCG sector

Expect Urban India to lead next leg of uptick -

Growth in FMCG sector seems to be stabilising for the past few quarters, after broad-based moderation witnessed in growth since FY13.

Few indicators are flashing Green - i) Sharp fall in CPI, ii) Uptick in consumer confidence indices, iii) Auto & Durables reported strong growth in last few months and iv) Corporate comments & dealer checks signalling revival in pockets of Tier I cities

However, waning stimulus, deceleration in farm & non-farm income and moderation in MSP growth is worrying for rural India

Reading into the above signals, we feel that growth deceleration seems to have bottomed out. Moreover, we feel that any revival from hereon will be led by urban India

Our Category pecking order - We continue to like price maker categories - Oral Care, Malted Foods, Infant Nutrition, Noodles, Cigarettes, etc. Among under-penetrated categories & urban revival plays, we like Digestives & OTC, Female Hygiene, Hair Colours, Biscuits, Home insecticide & Other Foods. We assign least preference to price taker categories-Soaps, Detergents & Hair oils - given competitive intensity and high penetration levels.

What would trigger further upsides to our estimates -

Revenue Triggers - Higher consumption led by uptick in investment cycle, implementation of GST, direct cash subsidy transfer & increase in employment opportunities

Margin Triggers - Softening input cost, rising premiumisation & supply chain gains post GST implementation

Our Revenue & Earnings Expectations for Emkay Consumer Staples Universe over FY14-FY17E

Normalised - We expect 12-17% revenue CAGR & 12-20% earnings CAGR

Blue Sky (GDP rebounding >8% and inflation <5%) – We expect 15-20% revenue & 25-30% earnings CAGR

""Preferences & Avoids - Based on urban revival and category preference, our top picks in the consumer staples space are Britannia, Colgate, GSK Consumer, Nestle, Dabur & Godrej Consumer, while top avoids are Emami, HUL & Marico"", says Emkay Global Financial Services research.

The week ended October 31 punctured the hopes of fence-sitting potential investors that a correction might be underway.

Both Sensex and Nifty gained 3.5 percent this week ending at their all-time closing levels of 27,866 and 8,322, respectively. Despite sincere attempt, broader markets failed to match up to benchmarks; BSE small-cap and CNX mid-cap indices rose between 2.5-2.8% this week. Realty, metals, IT, capital goods and banking stocks were the top gainers.

Market experts across the spectrum are unanimous in their view that Indian market is poised for a long-term bull run helped by improving macros, easing inflation, falling crude oil prices and an improved sentiment.

Friday witnessed massive gains on bourses after Bank of Japan (BoJ) put the mojo back into stocks globally and on account of short-covering. BoJ unexpectedly announced an expansion in the pace of its quantitative easing program by 30 trillion yen to 80 trillion on Friday. Japan's key index Nikkei hailed the move with 5 percent up-move. Global markets also towed the line; London's FTSE index, French CAC 40 and German DAX rallied 1.1-2 percent higher. Asian markets were led by Japan. Globally, investors now expect Japan and Europe to fill the void in easy liquidity, created by US's exit earlier this week.

Back home, foreign investors re-emerged as net buyers in equities after selling in the past few weeks fretting over what US Federal Reserve's commentary might be on interest rate front. However, Fed in a statement later committed to keep interest rates at record low levels for a ""considerable period of time,"" which spurred a global rally. The US central bank also ended its historic bond buying program citing improved labour market conditions.

""FIIs have bought in quite aggressively in the index Futures. Their position as of now is about USD 1.7 billion, at the start of the October contract it was just about USD 900 million. In fact during the early weeks of October it had come down and thereafter they have really added on a lot. Similarly there was buying even in the underlying cash market yesterday. The Put protection which was about USD 3.6 billion at the start of the month for October remains more or less the same. It is spread quite nicely between 7600 to 8000 contract for Nifty strikes and therefore we believe that the momentum will continue as we head into November now,"" said Vineet Bhatnagar MD, PhillipCapital.

Also, Fed's hawkish stance on US economy eroded the safe haven appeal of gold and silver, which tumbled to multi-year lows.

Crude oil too continued on its downward trajectory; Brent crude was last seen trading at $85.48 down 0.9% at 1548 hours on Friday.

An improved outlook on US economy had it's rub-off on stocks of IT companies this week, which largely depend on US economy for their exports. Making a comeback, BSE IT index swelled 5 percent on improved sentiment; TCS, Infosys, HCL Technology and Tech Mahindra rallied 4-6 percent.

Market Internals

Top Nifty gainers this week were Cipla, L&T, Infosys, Tata Power, BHEL, Tech Mahindra, IDFC, Tata Steel, HDFC, Hindalco and GAIL, which surged between 6-10 percent.

Shares of realty stocks rallied this week after the government relaxed rules for foreign direct investment (FDI). BSE Realty index hoisted 4.5 percent this week; Sobha Developers, Oberoi Realty and DLF, HDIL rallied between 1-3 percent.

Among key earnings, from the FMCG space HUL, ITC, Nestle and Emami posted mixed September quarter earnings this week.

Credit Suisse thinks FMCG sector is in a sweet spot with an improving growth outlook, easing inputs and benign competitive intensity and hence HUL's personal care business should benefit from all these, valuations leave little room for upside.

HUL's EBITDA margin expanded by 50 basis points (bps) YoY despite a sharp 160 bps fall in gross margins, as advertising spend dipped due to benign competitive intensity. ""The fall in gross margins was unexpected and was driven by a low base for raw material costs and higher excise duty. With softening commodity prices now only starting to kick in, we expect gross margins to start improving from Q3,"" Credit Suisse said in a note.

ITC matched street expectations on profit front but topline and operational performance disappointed. Net profit climbed 8.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,425 crore supported by other income and higher revenue. The profit in the year-ago period was Rs 2,230.5 crore.

Among autos, M&M and Maruti posted strong results reflecting an improvement in the demand scenario.

Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) reported a 4.3 percent decline in standalone profit at Rs 947 crore for the quarter ended September 2014 compared to Rs 989.5 crore in the year-ago period; hit by weak operational performance despite higher other income

""Standalone numbers seem to be in-line with what I was expecting because there was muted growth on both auto and tractor side. So taking the cognizance of that fact, the revenue seems to be in-line with the numbers. However, on the PAT side, it is a beat,"" said Ajay Shethiya, VP - Auto & Auto Ancillary, in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

Maruti stock touched record high levels at Rs 3332.90 per share, up almost 3 percent intraday on Friday after analysts upped the target price post strong Q2 performance. Maruti Suzuki beat street expectations on Thursday with the second quarter net profit rising 28.8 percent to Rs 863 crore led by other income and higher revenue. Profit in the year-ago period was Rs 670.2 crore.

India's largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel's second quarter profit jumped 24.8 percent sequentially (higher-than-expected) to Rs 1,383.2 crore in July-September quarter, the highest quarterly profit since March 2011. Year-on-year growth in profit was 170.2 percent.

What's next

Economy is yet to match stock market’s stride, show September core sector numbers, released on Friday post market hours. The core sector comprising 8 industries like electricity, steel, cement, coal etc, grew 1.9 percent in September compared to 5.8 percent growth in August and 9 percent in the same period last year. This might give investors a reason to take some profits off the table on Monday.

It's a truncated week as market will remain closed on Tuesday on account of Muharram. A slew of earnings and global cues are likely to dominate the sentiment on local bourses next week.

Investors globally will eye the European Central Bank and the Bank of England's decision on their respective interest rate policies on Thursday."
"December 30, 2013 08:58 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/are-kelloggs-hul-victimmultinational-egoindia-1373313.html,"R JagannathanFirstpost.com

Should a company that’s crossed a turnover of Rs 500 crore after nearly 20 years in the business be congratulating itself? Especially when the business is food, an area where rank outsiders have scaled up in almost no time?

The company in question is Kellogg in India, which launched its entire range of corn flakes and cereals in 1994, but has managed to cross a sales turnover of Rs 514 crore only in the year to March 2013. The Economic Times notes today (27 December) that the company grew 31 percent last year, “helped by India-centric innovations and single-serve affordable packs that attracted new customers.”

Does a company take 20 years to realise that the Indian market is different?

The problem with blue-blooded multinational companies like Kellogg or Coke or even a HIndustan Unilever, for that matter, is that they are often driven by policy evolved in headquarters – not in India. Plus, they are victims of what I would call the multinational ego – a state of mind that says what I sell in New York should be good enough for the natives of Mumbai. If I can sell corn flakes with cold milk in the US, why can’t Indians learn to love it? If Coke is the darling of carbonated drinks in Yankistan, why can the people of Hindustan learn to drink it?

To be sure, these are not the articulated reasons for adopting an India marketing policy that is uninformed by Indian preferences, but they do underlie business decisions that ultimately prove costly for multinationals.

Kellogg’s started out in 1994 with the idea of “changing India’s breakfast habits” when it would have made more sense to adapt Kellogg’s products to Indian habits – which is to have fresh warm/hot foods for breakfast. This is the market that believes in hot idlis, medu vadas, upma, poha, paranthas, etc – not cereal with cold milk. Even milk is largely consumed hot in India – after boiling, even if boiling is not required when consumed from tetrapacks. It is only lassi and curd that are consumed cold in India.

At a time when Nestle had already figured out that Indians loved hot foods with its Maggi noodles, Kellogg’s went for the all-American cold cereal approach. While both Nestle and Kellogg’s were hell-bent on changing Indian food habits, Nestle at least had got one thing right – the hot part of Indian food habits. Not surprisingly, today India is the biggest market for Maggi noodles in the world. But it has taken Nestle then all of 30 years to build.

Kellogg’s second brand – Chocos – came nearly 15 years after the launch of its corn flakes, suggesting that for much of a decade-and-a-half after launch, the management was brooding darkly on why Indians were not munching its stuff more willingly.

Kellogg’s is now beginning to accelerate because the penny has finally dropped: India is different. Among other things, it has launched oats, which can be consumed hot with milk, and flavoured corn flakes more suited to the Indian taste (mango, etc) and savouries, The Economic Times says.

The multinational ego has finally yielded ground to common sense, but the same ego has held back other food giants too.

Coke thought it would have a walkover when it bought Thums Up from Ramesh Chauhan of Parle around the same time Kellogg’s entered the Indian market. The idea was to take the market leader out of a rival’s hands, de-market it steadily, and then let Coke take over as numero uno. Today, 20 years later, Thums Up is still the market leader in colas, with a market share of about 16 percent, marginally above Pepsi’s 15 percent. And Coke? It has half the market share of Thums Up at around 8-9 percent. In short, Thums Up is what is keeping Coke ahead as a company, not Coke, the iconic brand. (Coke, though, is learning new tricks in the non-cola place with Sprite). The multinational ego around Brand Coke prevented the bosses in Atlanta from recognising this till they realised that Coke was naked in its fight against Pepsi’s aggression without a Thums Up to take the latter on.

The commonsense thing Coke’s bosses should have thought about when paying around $60 million to buy Thums Up in 1993 was this: when you own both brands, including the one that had 85 percent of the Indian cola market, does it make any difference if Coke won the battle or Thums Up? Does the tennis-loving Williams family in the US rejoice only if Serena wins at Wimbledon or also if Venus wins? Does it matter which amongst you brands wins?

One would have thought it was logical for the Coke management to invest heavily in the market leader they bought and allowed Coke to grow steadily at its own pace. But no, it hurt the egos of the top bosses to know that Coke was going to play second fiddle to that thing called Thums Up – a brand created in India for an Indian taste.

Something similar happened with Hindustan Unilever, too, which introduced Walls frozen desserts based on vegetable fats (rather than ice-cream, which is based on milk fat). When the company found that Indians still had a penchant for “real” ice-cream, it bought Kwality’s, which had a strong distribution franchise and market leadership in several key consuming markets.

But what did Levers do after buying the Kwality’s brand? It created a hybrid called Kwality Walls – neither fish nor fowl.

What is the point in buying a well-known brand if you are going to dilute it by hyphenating your own name – which then had no resonance in India - with it? The only sensible way to use two brands is to keep them separate, allowing each to grow a separate market. But Levers muddled it all up and to this day continues to play a distant second to Amul in the ice-creams/frozen desserts market.

To be sure, vegetable fats are cheaper, and this segment is helping the lower end of the fun foods market segment to grow faster, but there is little doubt Levers lost an early chance to make a two-pronged attack on the ice-creams business when it had a golden opportunity. At last count, Kwality Walls had a market share of around 14 percent while Amul had 38 percent. Amul is fighting the veg-oils based brands by emphasising the milk content in its ice-cream. Indians believe in the magical qualities of milk like none other.

And guess when Levers bought Kwality’s: 1994.

Three MNCs entered India with strong local or owned brands in the early 1990s, but they all made the same mistake of thinking that what works in their markets will work here too.

"December 02, 2013 09:42 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/oodlesnoodlesnepal-1548903.html,"The noodle magnate Binod Chaudhary, known half-jokingly in Kathmandu as ""Nepal's one-man multinational"", has long been the country's most prominent businessman.

This year, Forbes pushed him further into the limelight by listing him as the first Nepali to become a dollar billionaire. And the burly Mr Chaudhary shows few signs of slowing down. Among his myriad business and political ambitions, he now wants his Wai Wai instant noodle brand to win the struggle against competitors such as Nestle's Maggi and the Indonesian group Indofood's Indomie.""We have committed to making Wai Wai the world's largest brand some day,"" he says on a balcony at his headquarters overlooking the crowded and smoky streets of Kathmandu. ""Some of my friends in the industry may call it a tall claim, but I think you've got to dream big.""Mr Chaudhary first began producing noodles in 1984 in collaboration with Thai Preserved Food Factory. The privately held Chaudhary Group discloses very little financial information but he says the group's noodle sales amount to about USD 1 billion a year - or roughly half the non-Indonesian noodle sales of Indofood.Nowadays, Mr Chaudhary's interests extend far beyond instant noodles. In the 40 years since taking over the family company from his ailing father at the age of 18, he has expanded the group's industrial reach and taken its operations beyond south Asia to the US, Africa and the Middle East.He has entered a bewildering array of businesses in the domestic Nepali market and has four main areas of operation abroad: hotels in four continents, including joint ventures with India's Taj Hotels in the Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand; manufacture and export of fast-moving consumer goods (including the noodles); property; and a private equity company with investment plans for cement plants from Myanmar to Mozambique.""We do a little bit, dabble here and there, but by and large these are the four areas where we are growing globally,"" he says.Today the Chaudhary Group, together with its Singapore-based Cinnovation unit, spans 90 companies and 60 brands employing nearly 8,000 people. The business would be unrecognisable to his grandfather Bhuramull, a member of the Marwari business clan from Rajasthan in neighbouring India who moved to Nepal as a young man and began importing textiles in the late 19th century.Diversified conglomerates driven by powerful individuals may now be unfashionable in the west, but in the chaotic and often highly corrupt markets of south Asia, including Nepal, they have advantages, as Mr Chaudhary makes clear.""I guess that happens in most developing economies - a strong company always lands up having the first sort of opportunity to innovate a new business,"" he says. ""They're entrepreneurial, and they're not scared.""Look at Tata [the Indian conglomerate]. Tata called themselves 'from salt to IT' . . . and they're still diversifying. They're going to start a new airline, OK? And they are in hotels, they are in steel, they are in - you name it.""The background to his own group's rapid diversification and expansion was simple, Mr Chaudhary says. ""In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s we would on the one hand try to build our core competencies, which is branded, fast-moving consumer goods. But at the same time, we would not leave the other opportunities which came our way, because what was our strength? [It] was creating organisation, finding new talents, forging partnerships, putting the resources together.""Japan, he says, was his ""business school"". As a young man travelling on business to Japan in the 1970s, Mr Chaudhary not only learnt Japanese - prompted by his inability to order the vegetarian food he wanted without knowing the language. He also came to admire the way Japanese companies put available technology to use in the interests of their customers and of their own profits.""I saw how the Japanese work - the work culture of the Japanese, the team spirit of the Japanese, the really meticulous way of planning and managing things,"" says Mr Chaudhary, who imported Suzuki vehicles and struck deals with Panasonic and other Japanese companies in everything from textiles to beverages.""Perhaps one of the reasons why we are successful is that I was young. I was fresh. All those teachings influenced my way of working, and I tried to replicate that in Nepal, which I did to a large extent. We were miles ahead of our competition because we were following the practices - or we were at least trying to make a sincere attempt to follow the practices - of Japan in those days in terms of business, in terms of organisation-building, in terms of training, in terms of R&D.""The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused. > Succession planning at the group is already under way. Two of Mr Chaudhary's sons - Rahul and Varun - run the international operations from Singapore, Mumbai and Dubai, while the third - Nirvana - is focused on Nepali operations and is in the throes of launching the country's third mobile telephone network in one of Asia's most underserved markets.This has left time for the elder Mr Chaudhary to nurse his political ambitions in a country desperate for coherent leadership.He served in the first Constituent Assembly elected in 2008 after the end of the Maoist insurgency, but its mandate expired last year after it failed to agree on a new constitution, and a new assembly was elected on November 19.""Everybody knows me, with good reason, in Nepal,"" he says, while acknowledging that he is not sure precisely how or when or with which political party he might seek office. ""Neither do I need money by going into politics. So my objective of going into politics would be to create an economically vibrant country.""Asked whom he admires, he names Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar of India (the chief ministers of the states of Gujarat and Bihar respectively), Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand. The last two names suggest Mr Chaudhary sees a role for tycoons to apply their recipes for commercial success in the less tractable world of politics.""You've got to be absolutely clear about what is your goal. And it can't be a hazy, confused sort of goal full of deviations,"" he says. ""Then you've got to be able to put together a team . . . You've got to deal with corruption. You've got to deal with inaction.""Mr Chaudhary confidently declares that Nepal is ""not a difficult country to govern"", which would come as a surprise to the kings, Maoists and others who have tried to run it over the past century.As a businessman, however, he insists his focus would be on exploiting natural resources such as hydropower and otherwise helping to make the country richer.""I do not want to claim that I have solutions to all the problems,"" he says. ""I have solutions to one part of the problem, which is the economic development, which is the infrastructure building, which is to sell Nepal and bring in people who can help to take it to the next level."""

The government said on Thursday it would investigate allegations by charities that multinational corporations Nestle, Heinz and Abbott were breaking the law by promoting milk formula and infant cereals and undermining efforts to boost breastfeeding in the country.

Two charities - the Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India (BPNI) and International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) - say the three companies are using Indian websites to advertise and promote their baby milk and food products, which is illegal under the Infant Milk Substitutes Act, the IMS Act.A senior government official said authorities were concerned about the allegations, which were made at the start of World Breastfeeding Week, and would investigate.""BPNI is an authorised agency to monitor the violation of the IMS Act,"" Dr Shreeranjan, joint secretary of the ministry of women and child development, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""If what they are saying is on merit, we will definitely support them and seek to take action.""The World Health Organization (WHO) - which recommends exclusive breastfeeding for babies up to six months old - says formula is not as healthy as breast milk and that there are risks of illnesses such as diarrhoea from using unsafe water.Child malnutrition can also result from over-diluting formula to ""stretch"" supplies, it said.India has one of the highest child malnutrition rates in the world, around 42 percent of Indian children under five being underweight.Only 47 percent of Indian mothers exclusively breastfeed for the first six months, compared with 98 percent in countries such as Sweden""Mothers are often inundated with incorrect and biased information both directly, through advertising, health claims, information packs and sales representatives, and indirectly through the public health system,"" the WHO said in a statement earlier this week in which it called for countries to do more to support breastfeeding.India was one of only 37 countries which enacted legislation after the World Health Assembly in 1974 urged member states to review sales promotion activities on baby foods and introduce laws on advertisements of such products.The IMS Act prohibits all kinds of promotion of baby milk formula and cereals - including advertising, inducements, and sponsoring seminars and other events for doctors or medical associations.The law also stipulates that the labelling of all baby food products shall follow certain criteria, and that the products should not be promoted for children below two years of age.Both the BPNI and the IBFAN say research conducted over the last three months shows that Heinz, Nestle and Abbott are using Indian internet shopping websites such as babyoye.com, healthkart.com and firstcry.com to promote their products in the electronic media.""India has one of the most comprehensive laws in the world when it comes to outlawing the promotion of formula milk and infant foods for children below two years old,"" said Dr. Arun Gupta, IBFAN's Asia coordinator.""But 21 years since it was enacted, it is clear that the law is being blatantly violated by big corporates who are misleading mothers.""When contacted by Thomson Reuters Foundation, the three companies said the allegations against them were incorrect.""Nestle India does not have any contract and/or commercial relationship with any external websites for its infant nutrition products and we do not supply to them,"" Nestle India said in a statement emailed to the Thomson Reuters Foundation.""We sell to distributors and we educate them about the IMS Code and the importance of complying with it. At the same time E-commerce websites are like retail stores and the IMS Code does not restrict them from indicating the available products.""Abbott said that while it sells its products to a number of different channels and distributors, all are legally obliged to abide by the law.Babyoye.com, which sells both Nestle and Abbott products for babies and infants and promotes health claims on its site, said it sourced products directly from the brands or their authorised partners.""For sensitive products associated with baby feeding we make it a point to ensure that we do not promote them in any of our campaigns. All feeding products pages have an explicit statement promoting breast-feeding,"" said a statement from babyoye.com's CEO Sanjay Nadkarni.Other websites mentioned by charities, healthkart.com and firstcry.com - which offers promotions on Heinz products - had not responded to Thomson Reuters Foundation requests for information by the time of publication.Heinz's Vice President for Corporate Affairs Mohan V denied the allegations against the company, saying that Heinz neither manufactured nor sold infant food products in India.He suggested that the products, which were made in England, were being ""smuggled"" into India and sold to the websites by a third party."

FMCG major Nestle India today reported a 10.33 percent increase in net profit to Rs 271.38 crore for the second quarter ended June 30 due to robust sales growth across various business verticals.

The company had posted a net profit of Rs 245.97 crore during the same period of the previous year.

"July 06, 2013 04:39 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/-1756411.html,"Swift responses from Swiss food company Nestle and French rival Danone to Beijing's announcement that it was investigating possible price-fixing of instant milk formulas are textbook examples of how firms should deal with such crises in China, executives and consultants say.

Just a day after official Chinese media reported the top economic planning agency had launched the probe into six firms, including Nestle and Danone, the two companies said on Wednesday they would cut prices of some instant milk products.

It was not clear how long the companies had known they may become the subject of investigation. But once it became public, they had to respond quickly before negative reports were circulated on Chinese social media, which could harm reputations and sales.

The strategy seems to have worked - there has been limited comment on the subject so far, both in state media and online.

""The media environment here has absolutely changed. Social media has revolutionised what companies do in a crisis situation,"" said Kent Kedl, in charge of Greater China and North Asia for risk consultancy firm Control Risks.

""It needs to be taken into account because the chatter out there really creates a voice of its own.""

KFC-parent Yum Brands came under heavy fire from both mainstream and social media after the official China Central Television (CCTV) reported in late December that some of the chicken supplied to KFC and McDonald's Corp contained excess amounts of antiviral drugs and hormones used to accelerate growth.

McDonald's responded by saying its chicken and raw materials pass through independent, third party tests. Analysts said KFC was dealt a heavier blow because it sold mainly chicken products and its bigger presence in China made it a bigger target.

The company made its first public apology nearly a month after the report but it failed to quell the widespread backlash, which left many KFC outlets in China empty and prompted the company to warn of a drop in profit this year. Yum was not fined by food safety authorities.

In another example, Apple Inc came under fire from another CCTV report in mid-March that said Chinese customers were not given the same post-sales service as users in other markets.

Until Apple apologised to Chinese consumers for poor communication over its warranty policy and changed some of the terms nearly a month later, it came under near-daily assault from mainstream media.

China Rules

In contrast, Volkswagen AG , which in the same CCTV programme was criticised for a long-standing gearbox issue, announced just three days later that it would recall vehicles to fix the problem, sparing it from the heavy barrage of negative publicity that hit Apple.

Jack Perkowski, an American who founded one of the first foreign auto parts makers based in the country in 1994, said there was little that companies, both foreign and domestic, could gain by fighting back against the government, including state media.

""Foreign firms have to realise that they don't set the rules in China. In China, everyone has to play by Chinese rules,"" Perkowski, who now heads US-based bank JFP Holdiings, told Reuters during a recent visit to Shanghai.

Apple, in its initial response to the CCTV report, said it respected Chinese consumers and that its warranty policies were roughly the same worldwide with specific adjustments to adhere to Chinese law.

However, criticism from state media only intensified following the comment, with even China's market regulator telling state radio that Apple needed to strengthen supervision of its policies.

Executives and consultants say publicly refuting allegations can be tricky in China and should be only done when proper evidence can be provided.

A China-based executive at a major Japanese carmaker said his company takes even a more cautious approach when the accusation is made directly by the government.

""We would never publicly deny what the government says even if it's 100 percent wrong,"" said the executive who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.

""In one case, we simply said 'no comment' for the record while we directly spoke with the government on the issue to sort out the misunderstanding.""

Kedl, from Control Risks, said an essential part of crisis management in China was building relationships with various wings of the state before any crisis took place.

""The worst time to have to get to know people in the government is when you are in middle of a crisis,"" he said.

""It's like building an airplane while you're flying it. It just doesn't work. If you have relationships, it creates a road for you.""

Nestle SA, the world`s biggest food and drink company, is boosting research to tackle the threat of ever-stronger strains of bacteria and germs in food manufacturing.

The Vevey, Switzerland-based company said Thursday it will initially focus on several types of food-borne bacteria — particularly a dangerous strain of bacterium E. coli that infects people and pumps out a poison called Shiga toxin — and viruses Norovirus and Hepatitis A.

A European outbreak of the Shiga toxin in the summer of 2011 infected about 4,000 people, mostly in Germany, and caused 50 deaths.

Company officials and industry experts looked over more than 20 new microbiology labs that Nestle opened Thursday within its research center outside Lausanne, the last time they will be shown publicly before sealing them off and restricting access to scientists in protective clothing.

They described the spotless new labs as among the world`s most advanced microbiology research facilities, and the most sophisticated in the food industry, some at biosafety containment level three, on a scale of one to four.

Nestle`s chief technology officer, Werner Bauer, said his biggest worry is antibiotic-resistant germs, and the company needs to stay a step ahead of new threats from evolving pathogens such as drug-resistant strains of Salmonella or the E. coli that produces the Shiga toxin.

John O`Brien, a former chief executive of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland who is now head of food safety at Nestle`s research center, said the company ""cannot afford errors"" as it aims for better ways of processing food that kills germs but keeps as much of the nutrients and taste as possible. That requires a lot of genetic and enzymatic testing.

""With the increasing problem of emerging food-borne pathogens, such as the Shiga toxin-producing strains of E. coli, a risk assessment is only possible once we know what genes are carried by that organism,"" O`Brien told officials. ""So we need to get down to the genome level increasingly. Now, that requires a lot of molecular detective work, which is why we are investing so much in molecular tools."""

2013 is turning into a dream run for HSBC. After its successful conclusion of the Glaxosmithline PLC voluntary open offer earlier, it surprised the street with yet another voluntary open offer worth USD 5.4 billion from Unilever PLC for its Indian arm Hindustan Unilever (HUL).

It seems HSBC is turning out to be the banker of choice for European Multi National Companies (MNCs) planning to consolidate their presence in India reports CNBC-TV18’s Nimesh Shah and Arvind Sukumar

It acted as the sole financial advisor to Unilever Plc in its bid to hike its stake in its Indian listed subsidiary Hindustan Unilever to 75 percent. The transaction will be the largest stake enhancement by any MNC in India, and will bring around USD 5.4 billion of foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country. It is the largest FDI inflow from the UK over the last 12 months, after the RIL-BP deal.

Earlier this month, HSBC acted as the financial advisor to Etihad Airways and was instrumental in the airline's recently-announced deal with Jet Airways. This landmark USD 600 million deal represents the largest FDI in aviation since the rules were relaxed. It is also one of the largest foreign transactions from Abu Dhabi.

Earlier, in January 2013, HSBC India successfully advised Glaxosmithkline Plc on increasing its stake in GSK's India-listed subsidiary Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare. The USD 901 million deal involved a 29.3 percent stake in GSK India. HSBC had also advised ABB and Siemens’ parent to hike their stakes in their Indian arms.

Moreover, the street will now focus on other MNC's like Nestle, Colgate and P&G, to see if they will follow GSK Cosumer and Unilever and hike their holdings in their Indian arms."

We are projecting that airlines will make a net profit of USD 10.6 billion on USD 671 billion in industry revenues.""By comparison last year, Nestle, a single company, made over USD 11.5 billion in profit on revenues of about USD 100 billion,"" said Tony Tyler, chief of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) while announcing the 2013 financial outlook for the global airline industry.IATA estimated the airlines to produce a combined net post-tax profit margin of 1.6 percent, with a net post-tax profit of USD 10.6 billion.""Chronic anaemic profitability is characteristic across most of the aviation value chain when compared to other sectors. It will require more than improving economic conditions to fix,"" Tyler said.IATA estimated that jet fuel would average at USD 130 a barrel and the combined airlines' fuel bill would grow to USD 216 billion, accounting for 33 percent of airline costs.Even though airline cash flows were showing better than expected performance given high costs and weak growth, it varied by region and airline size.""Large Asian carriers have seen the most improvement.

The domestic FMCG industry valued at Rs 1.6 trillion (Source: Nielsen) is characterized by the large presence of multinationals through subsidiaries. Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Nestle, Colgate and GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (GSKCH) are among the top companies that define the consumer goods landscape in India. While these companies have the advantage of access to their parent companies' established global brands, they are required to pay royalty charges for selling the overseas brands in the domestic market.

A look at the chart above clearly shows that FMCG behemoth HUL pays the lowest royalty among the multinational companies in the country. The reason for the same can partly be attributed to Indian brands that contribute a sizeable share of 47% to overall revenues (industry estimates). HUL's well known Indian brands include Wheel, Fair & Lovely, Lakme, Hamam, Breeze, Annapurna, Kissan and Pureit. Among its global brand offerings are Lux, Lifebuoy, Ponds, Vaseline, Dove, Surf, Close-Up, Sunsilk, Brew, Axe, Knorr and Clinic.

But does ownership of a large portfolio comprising of Indian and global brands really help?

The answer to this question lies in studying the brand performance over a period of time.

HUL's brand performance remains tepid

PAT (Rs bn) Networth (Rs bn) Brand (Rs bn) FY02/CY01 FY12/CY11 *(%) FY02/CY01 FY12/CY11 *(%) FY02/CY01 FY12/CY11 *(%) HUL 15.8 28 6% 31.4 36.8 2% 73.7 149.9 7% Colgate 0.7 4.5 20% 2.5 4.4 6% 2.2 25.4 28% Nestle 1.7 9.6 19% 2.7 12.7 17% 8.9 51.4 19% GSKCH 1.3 3.6 11% 4.4 11.4 10% 4 12.2 12%

10-yr Compounded Annual Growth Rate

Note: Brand value has been estimated as the difference between the visible networth sitting on the books of the company and the total networth required by a company to earn 15% ROE at the same net profit level. In other words, whatever profit growth the companies have been achieving over and above what is required to earn more than 15% ROE is being attributed to its brand value

The study clearly shows that brand success is not guaranteed by number of brands alone. In fact, HUL with its huge brand portfolio has been a laggard as far as brand performance is concerned. In the past decade, the company's brands grew by a measly 7% as compared to robust double-digit growth clocked by Nestle and Colgate. Even a relatively small company, GSKCH with presence only in malted beverages has performed much better on the brand front.

Conclusion: While addition of a brand certainly adds to the company's brand equity, but it starts contributing towards shareholder's returns only through a concerted and focused brand strategy. Therefore HUL has been sharpening its brand focus in the past two years. The company has expanded existing power brands such as Vaseline, Ponds, Fair & Lovely and Dove to adjacent product categories. At the same time, the company recently launched premium personal care brands Sure (anti-prespirant) and TRESemme (hair care) from its global portfolio. Going forward, HUL should benefit from its revamped brand strategy."

FMCG companies continued to ride a robust growth trajectory in September 2012 quarter. However, there has been a divergence in the performance between pure food based and other FMCG companies. While each of the diversified FMCG companies has clocked double-digit sales growth, the turnover of large food companies has grown in single-digits. Poor off take was the main reason for the slow growth in turnover.

Nestle SA and General Mills Inc will cut sugar and salt in the children's breakfast cereals they jointly market outside North America, the latest attempt by major food companies to respond to health concerns.

The two have been in a joint venture since 1990 to sell Nestle-brand cereals such as Cheerios in more than 140 countries outside the United States and Canada, markets which account for about half total global cereal sales of some USD 25 billion.

They say they will reformulate 20 cereal brands popular with children and teenagers by 2015, boosting wholegrains and calcium and aiming for average reductions of 24 percent in sugar and 12 percent in sodium.

The reformulation will affect about 5.3 billion portions of cereals sold each year.

The 50/50 joint venture called Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) is the second-biggest breakfast cereal producer after Kellogg Co but is Europe's leading manufacturer of children's cereal. It had sales of 1.9 billion Swiss francs in 2011.

CPW Chief Executive Jeffrey Harmening said the plan builds on efforts started in 2003 to improve the nutritional profile of cereals. The group has cut almost 900 tonnes of salt and more than 9,000 tonnes of sugar from its recipes since then.

""A certain number of moms don't want their kids to have as much sugar as they do right now, so that is a barrier for some to purchasing breakfast cereal,"" Harmening told Reuters at CPW's new global innovation centre in the Swiss town of Orbe.

The move comes as food and beverage companies seek to preempt tougher regulation due to the global obesity epidemic by offering healthier products or smaller portions.

The World Health Organisation estimated there were over 42 million overweight children under the age of five in 2010. It says obesity in Europe is already responsible for up to 8 percent of health costs and up to 13 percent of deaths.

HIGH IN SUGAR

A study this year by British consumer magazine Which? found that 32 of the 50 top-selling cereals were high in sugar, with almost all those aimed at children - including Cheerios - recording levels of sugar similar to chocolate biscuits.

However it did say that most cereals had significantly lower levels of salt than a few years ago and judged Nestle's Shredded Wheat the healthiest, with low levels of sugar, fat and salt.

Malcolm Clark, coordinator of the Children's Food Campaign of Britain's Sustain charity, which seeks to protect children from junk food marketing, was sceptical about the Nestle move.

""Reformulating is great, but the question is how they then talk about their products. They can't talk about them being healthy. They will be mildly less unhealthy than they were before,"" he said.

Harmening defended breakfast cereals as a low-calorie, high-nutrition option and said children who eat them tend to have a lower body mass index than those who do not.

Kellogg - which makes some of the sweetest cereals according to several surveys - has also reformulated some brands in recent years to cut sugar, as has General Mills for the cereals it produces for the North American market.

McDonald's Corp is including apples and cutting calories in its Happy Meals for kids, while Kraft Foods Group Inc has stopped advertising Kool-Aid and Oreos to children. It has also cut sugar and salt in some products.

In a report earlier this year, Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity said US cereal producers are offseting the benefits of cutting sugar and adding wholegrains by targeting kids with more ads for their unhealthiest products.

LESS MARKETING

""There is a fundamental difference between what the food industry thinks is improvement and what the public health community thinks is improvement,"" said Dr Jennifer Harris, director of marketing initiatives at the Rudd Center.

""The food industry is really focusing on reformulating products that they've always marketed to children, which are some of their highest-sugar products, whereas what we want to see is less marketing overall for unhealthy products.""

Harmening said CPW's move was driven by consumers rather than a threat of tougher regulation, which he said could backfire as people might switch to less healthy alternatives.

""If we're not delivering what they want, somebody else will deliver what they are looking for. The consumers are the judge.""

He said the biggest challenge was to improve the nutritional profile of cereals without compromising on taste.

At CPW's research centre in Orbe, food scientists are already testing recipes that comply with the new targets, experimenting with cooking and drying techniques to maintain flavour even with less sugar and salt and more wholegrain.

Trained teams of sensory experts sample the new products in laboratories where different coloured lights force them to focus on taste rather than appearance of the cereals.

""We spend an enormous amount of time and money so that consumers don't perceive the changes,"" said Harmening. ""That is a competitive advantage for us because - to the extent we can crack that - we will receive a benefit from consumers."""

Motilal Oswal has come out with its earnings estimates on consumer sector for September quarter FY13. According to the research firm, steep INR depreciation has negated the impact in many commodities, prices of which are linked globally. Britannia, GlaxoSmithKline, Hindustan Unilever, Nestle and Marico are likely to report EBITDA margin expansion while Asian Paints and Colgate are likely to report flat margins.

Expect another steady quarter - 16% sales growth, 18% PAT growth: For 2QFY13, we expect our coverage universe to post ~16% revenue growth (16% in 1QFY13) and ~18% PAT growth (~22% in 1QFY13). EBITDA is likely to grow 18.5% on sustained revenue growth and softening input costs. We expect ITC to post 16% sales growth (1% cigarette volume growth) and ~17% PAT growth; Hindustan Unilever's sales are likely to grow 15% (volume growth of 8%) and PAT is likely to grow 19%, led by healthy growth in Soaps & Detergents and Personal Care products.

No concerns on broadbased demand outlook; no down-trading witnessed: Except for a few discretionary categories, consumer demand in Processed Foods has been healthy. Late revival of the monsoon provides respite to future rural consumer demand. Despite the past few quarters of price hikes, volume growth across product categories is likely to remain healthy. We expect moderation in demand in few discretionary categories. All companies under our universe, barring Nestle, are likely to report healthy volume growth in HPC categories.

Agri-based input costs and crude soften; INR depreciation negates impact: Prices of edible oils like groundnut oil, safflower oil and sunflower oil, and other agri commodities like copra, wheat, barley, sugar and palm oil are down on a YoY basis. Prices of crude and crude-linked commodities are also on a downward trend. However, steep INR depreciation has negated the impact in many commodities, prices of which are linked globally. Britannia, GlaxoSmithKline, Hindustan Unilever, Nestle and Marico are likely to report EBITDA margin expansion while Asian Paints and Colgate are likely to report flat margins.

Sustenance of volume growth amidst weaker macro environment will be the key highlight of 2QFY13, in our view. For 2QFY13, we estimate our coverage universe to post ~16% revenue growth (16% in 1QFY13) and ~18% PAT growth (~22 % in 1QFY13). EBITDA is likely to grow 18.5% on the back of sustained revenue growth and some softening in input costs. We expect ITC to post 16% sales growth (1% cigarette volume growth) and ~17% PAT growth; HUL’s sales are likely to grow 15% (8% volume growth) and 19% PAT growth.

"October 01, 2012 12:54 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/-1895485.html,"The USD 67 billion market for cat and dog food is attracting more than just pets. Potential disposals also have investors salivating.

The industry once focused on selling standard cans of vaguely meaty concoctions. Now it commands miles of shelf space, replete with bags of dried food targeted at pets of different ages, as well as gourmet single-serve dinners.In the US the market is quadruple the size of that for baby food and twice the size of coffee. It boasts fat margins - pet food is the second-most profitable category behind coffee for Nestl�, the world's biggest food company - and is growing at a faster clip than the human variety.Two possible disposals are also tantalising the industry - Colgate-Palmolive's Hill's brand and Procter & Gamble's Iams. Each boasts turnover of about USD 2 billion , on Bernstein Research estimates, implying price tags of USD 2.6 billion -USD 3 billion apiece.The sector's buoyancy is in sharp contrast to the lacklustre performance of other parts of the consumer goods business. At a compound annual growth rate of 3-4 per cent in developed markets, pet food has been growing at twice the rate of personal care and home care, according to Bernstein Research.Manufacturers have been borrowing practices more commonly associated with items for human consumption to lift profits. These include introducing ultra-premium and organic varieties as well as ""single serve"" portions. Mirroring high-margin Nespresso coffee pods, cat and dog food is also sold in one-meal servings.""It's just like your tin of tuna, but they charge more because it's for your cat,"" says Morgan Stanley analyst Eileen Khoo.Some 20 per cent of Nestl�'s growth in earnings before interest and tax over the next few years will come from pet food, according to Ms Khoo - not least as many dog owners trade up from the fad for Chihuahuas to Great Danes which, helpfully for food manufacturers, eat 12 times as much as their smaller brethren.""It's one of the hidden jewels in Nestl�,"" Ms Khoo says of the Swiss-based group's Purina petcare business, acquired in late 2001 for USD 10.3bn. ""It has the highest return on capital, at over 25 per cent and plays to the whole humanisation [of animals] trend.""Privately owned Mars, best known for its chocolate bars, also makes the Pedigree and Whiskas brands and has a market share of about 20 per cent. Nestl�'s share is roughly the same.Behind them, with about 4 per cent of the market each, are Hill's and Iams. Analysts reckon both are potential disposals. The purchase of a stake in P&G by activist shareholder Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital prompted speculation that non-core businesses such as pet food and batteries would be spun off.For Colgate the problem is that Hill's has ""hit a virtual wall, losing share and delivering no growth"", according to Ali Dibadj, analyst at Bernstein Research. This is partly due to missing the drive towards ""natural"" products and limited exposure to emerging markets. Both Hill's and Iams largely target the premium end.Speaking in July, Ian Cook, Colgate chief executive, said Hill's had not ""made enough progress in penetrating the faster growing natural segment"".The company's Science Diet - sold partly through vets - is to be converted and relaunched with more ""consumer friendly"" ingredients in the second half of the year.Pet food makes up 13 per cent of Colgate's revenues and Mr Dibadj says its rhetoric suggests it is unlikely to jettison the segment in the near future. Colgate did not respond to a request for comment.P&G declined to comment on spin-off speculation, but stressed that it strengthened Iams with the acquisition of Natura in 2010 and said the division ""mirrors our time-tested model for business growth"".Nestl�'s example demonstrates the appeal of keeping pet food in the fold. In the first half, profits from pet care - which makes up more than one-tenth of group sales - rose 12.25 per cent year-on-year, virtually double the overall group growth rate.Adjusted operating margins, at 20.7 per cent, were comfortably ahead of the group's overall 15 per cent. Morgan Stanley is estimating the division will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.5 per cent through 2015, with margin improvement of around 80 basis points per annum, versus 30 basis points for the group.The US will be central to this. Unusually for Nestl�, which derives over 40 per cent of sales from emerging markets, it lags behind Mars in much of Asia and Latin America. Reversing that would provide another fillip to earnings.Like all food industries, there are pitfalls, including spiralling input prices, cash-strapped consumers and a growing private label effort. But for now manufacturers like Nestl� - which went so far as to run an ad aimed at dogs rather than their owners - are banking on four-legs remaining good."

Even as economic uncertainty continues to loom, the FMCG sector remains a darling of the stock-market. The BSEFMCG index currently commands steep valuations of 47 times its trailing 12 months (TTM) earnings ending June 2012. In contrast, the broad market represented by SENSEX is trading at 23 times its TTM earnings.

As more investors flock to the FMCG sector as a defensive measure, FMCG stocks continue to reap huge investment returns. Blue-chip stocks like Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Nestle Britannia and Glaxo SmithKline Consumer yielded over ten-fold jump in return for every rupee invested ( One rupee test ) during the period FY10-FY12. Clearly, the FMCG sector is being lapped up by the investor community.Warren Buffet, the guru of value investing believed that the best way to test the investment potential of a stock is to determine the return earned by shareholders on every rupee invested. In other words, have these stocks generated at least one rupee for every rupee invested? This is measured by the increase in market cap relative to the increase in net worth.The table below shows that FMCG companies have done very well with the ""one rupee test"", which is why investors are willing to wager on this defensive bet?One Rupee test on FMCG companies (standalone)

is India`s leading independent equity research initiative

Source: Ace Equity* Results follow calendar yearA critical evaluation of the table also shows that post 2010, the returns fetched on most FMCG stocks have declined in comparison to returns earned during the 2005-10 period. Dabur, Godrej Consumer and Marico have been in an expansion mode and as a result their value appreciation has been modest.However, Glaxo SmithKline Consumer posted a steep jump in the ""one rupee test"" value in the FY10-FY12 period, and has been an exception in being higher than that for the FY05-FY10 period. FMCG behemoth, HUL, has continued to fetch over 40 times higher return for every rupee invested. The company has witnessed robust rise in its topline, and strong earnings growth since FY10. This has been the result of the return of pricing power and the company's renewed focus on the high margin personal care segment.Another reason that the FMCG sector may be high in terms of value created is that market perception itself may be driving more and more investors to this industry viewed as ""defensive"". In this context, Benjamin Graham points out that the return earned on the stock of a company is a sum total of the real return, rate of inflation, and the return based on the market perception.FMCG companies have been clocking double-digit sales growth despite price hikes. There does not seem to be any meaningful slowdown in consumption patterns. This pricing power has enabled them to maintain, and in some cases, even improve their profitability. Firm interest rates, high inflation and government policy paralysis do not seem to have affected the FMCG sector. At the same time, other sectors such as automobile, capital goods, power, infrastructure, realty and banking have been reeling under the challenging conditions.And this weakness in other sectors has in turn further added to the charm of investing in the FMCG industry.In our next article, we shall discuss whether the FMCG sector still holds steam or has sector peaked and is ripe for a correction."

""The World Food Organization has now determined what I have been preaching for years: no food for producing fuels, too much land is lost for nutrition,"" Peter Brabeck told Austrian paper Wiener Zeitung in an interview printed on Tuesday.

""But there is a strong lobby and high subsidies behind this so I expect an even stronger food and hunger crisis than in 2008,"" he added.

Brabeck was referring to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which this month stepped up pressure on the United States to change its biofuel policies because of the danger of a world food crisis.

Global alarm over the potential for a food crisis of the kind seen in 2007/08 has escalated as drought in the U.S. midwest has sent grain prices to record highs, fuelling a 6 percent surge in the FAO's July food price index."

Enthused by robust financial performance and attractive valuations, foreign investors increased their exposure to fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies such as Britannia , Hindustan Unilever and Godrej Consumers Products in April-June this year.

Most of the foreign entities sell or purchase Indian stocks through FII route and the data showed that only five of the 16 large FMCG companies have witnessed a decline in their FII holding in the April-June quarter over the preceding January-March quarter.

Foreign institutional investors' (FII) holding has increased in 11 consumer goods firms during this period, according to a report by A C Choksi Share Brokers.

Domestic institutional investors, on the other hand, raised their holdings in seven companies and reduced stake in the remaining nine stocks during the March quarter.

""FIIs are primarily betting on Large Caps while DIIs are positive on Mid Caps in the sector,"" the brokerage firm noted.

FII holding in

Britannia

,

Jyothy Laboratories

, Hindustan Unilever and Godrej Consumers Products increased by more than a percentage point.

However, they reduced ownership in United Spirits,

GSK Consumer Healthcare

,

Dabur

,

Emami

and

Nestle

in the quarter.

Besides, FIIs increased stakes in

ITC

,

Marico

, Bajaj Corp,

Colgate

, Zydus Wellness, Asian Paints, Berger Paints during the June quarter.

Experts believe that FIIs have been showing interest in the Indian FMCG companies due to their defensive appeal and attractive valuation.

""FIIs are betting on FMCG stocks because of defensive appeal and these stocks are performing well on earnings front. Another major reason for hike in FIIs ownership FMCG stocks was that these stocks are available at good price,"" Destimoney Securities MD and CEO Sudip Bandyopadhyay said.

Overall, FIIs stayed away with Indian equity market during April-June quarter and pulled out Rs 1,957 crore, after a net investment of nearly Rs 44,000 crore in the preceding quarter (January-March).

The BSE benchmark's Sensex rose by a marginal 26 points to close at 17,430 points on June 29.

Interestingly, over the past 12 months, FIIs have increased their positions in all the stocks other than Marico, Jyothy Labs, Dabur, United Spirits and Zydus Wellness.

On the contrary, DIIs have been reducing positions in consumer stocks except in Marico, Emami, Jyothy Labs, Dabur and United Spirits over the past 12 months."

and Procter & Gamble .

Unilever, with annual revenues of 46.5 billion euros, said second-quarter underlying sales rose 5.8% helped by its lower exposure to problem economies, such as Spain, than Danone, while it has more business in fast-growing markets like India and Indonesia than P&G.

""The macro economic situation is difficult and shows signs of further deterioration and there is volatility in commodities, but we still expect to deliver a modest improvement in operating margins for 2012,"" finance director Jean-Marc Huet told a conference call on the quarterly results on Thursday.

The 5.8% rise beat a company-compiled consensus of 4.8% and came after a first-quarter increase of 8.4% and 6.5% growth for 2011. Emerging markets, which make up 55% of sales, saw growth of 11%.

Unilever Plc shares rose 4.0% to 2,227 pence by 08:03 GMT to be the third biggest riser in a largely flat FTSE 100 index after the stock had risen around 7% since the start of June.

""We had hoped that Unilever could sail smoothly through 2012 despite macro volatility and challenges, unlike some of its major peers especially Danone and P&G, and this seems to have been confirmed in both the reported results and the reiterated 2012 guidance,"" said analyst Andrew Wood at Bernstein Research.

Other analysts said Unilever was helped by its larger exposure to emerging markets than its rival and a strong performance from its personal care business with quarterly sales up 10.4% led by products such as Dove and Clear shampoo.

European sales fell 2.2% in the quarter, but Huet said euro zone crisis-hit southern European economies accounted for less than 4% of total group sales, and although sales there were down this was partially offset by good performances in Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands.

Unilever, the world's No.3 consumer goods group after Nestle and P&G, held its forecast for modest profit margin expansion this year. Its half-year profit margin was flat, but analysts expect it to rise in the second half.

Huet said inputs cost would be a little higher than its previous forecast for a mid single digit percentage for 2012, but emphasised prices for its major commodities such as vegetable oil were very volatile.

Unilever, which counts Lipton, Sunsilk and Lux among its biggest brands, reported core half-year earnings up 6% to 0.76 euros a share, while it raised its quarterly dividend by 8% to 0.243 euros a share.

Last month, Danone warned of a hit to profits after recession-hit Spanish consumers switched to cheaper yoghurt, while P&G cut its growth forecasts blaming a lack of big new products and being slow to cut costs.

Unilever is the first of the major European food groups to report with Danone due on Friday and Nestle on August 9.

The maker of brands such as Dove and Knorr is facing tough trading in southern Europe and seeing some commodities costs edge up. However, it stuck to its 2012 targets rather than alarm investors like Danone"

"May 09, 2012 01:04 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/-1910425.html,"Nestle, purveyor of the decades-old KitKat snack, has launched an app it says addresses a growing problem among young social media users - giving them a break from the stress of posting updates by doing it for them.

The software, Social Break, automatically sends random updates to users' Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. It will be officially launched in Singapore later this week and is free to download from kitkat.com.sg/socialbreak.

While the application is a tongue-in-cheek marketing gimmick, the developers behind the software, ad agency JWT, say it also highlights a serious problem among younger users, especially in Asia: growing stress about time spent maintaining a presence on social networks.

JWT surveyed 900 19-26 year olds in China, Singapore and the United States and found that more than half considered it too time-consuming to keep up with all their social media commitments and conceded that the time they spent on such sites had a negative impact on their job or studies.

JWT says that their survey shows that young people feel under increasing pressure to maintain their social media connections, responding to friends' requests to comment on or ""like"" their posts, photographs or other updates.

Nearly two thirds of Chinese surveyed said they felt pressure to be in constant contact on social media, with 58 percent saying their social media obligations caused them stress.

""Social media used to be fun. It shouldn't be an obligation, it shouldn't be another life we have to maintain,"" says Valerie Cheng, executive creative director of JWT's Singapore, which was hired by Nestle to develop the app.

Asia is home to some of the biggest social media populations in the world. Socialbakers, a service which monitors usage, lists Indonesia, India and the Philippines among the top 10 countries on Facebook.

Nearly 57% of Singapore's population is on Facebook. A survey published by consultants McKinsey last month found that China has by far the world's most active social media population, with 91 percent of respondents saying they visited a social media site in the previous six months, compared with 30% in Japan and 67 percent in the United States.

RANDOM RESPONSE

Users of the KitKat app can enter account details for Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook and then choose how frequently they want the software to send updates.

It will then respond to items where the user has been tagged with one of eight random messages. LinkedIn will occasionally forward links posted by other users, while Twitter will respond randomly to messages from other users.

""We found that the reason young people need breaks is because of their social media responsibilities, but that's exactly what they do when they're on a break,"" said Lydia Daly, JWT planning director. ""It's a vicious circle.""

JWT acknowledged the app may not find favour with Facebook.

Cheng pointed to an app launched by fast-food chain Burger King in 2009 which, she said, had a similarly irreverent attitude towards one's social media network - calling on users to delete friends in return for free burgers. Facebook disabled the app, saying it violated its privacy policy.

JWT says that if the Social Break app is a success they hope to adapt it to work on China's homegrown social networks and, in the long run, introduce elements of artificial intelligence into automated responses.

For now, said Daly, the most important thing was to avoid causing offence or embarrassment with inappropriate responses, such as posting something flippant to news that a friend's grandfather had died."

Nestle , the world's biggest food group, is closing in on a deal to buy Pfizer's infant nutrition business for up to USD 10 billion to boost its business in China and extend its lead in the world of formula milk for babies, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The Swiss group had already been seen as favourite for the business, and is now set to seal a deal later this month after outbidding a joint team of Danone and Mead Johnson in a largely two-horse race.

""Nestle is in the lead position and is closing in on a deal which we expect soon,"" said one source.

Another source said the business would fetch USD 9-10 billion and expected a deal by the end of the April.

If Danone loses out, analysts say the French group will face a problem of how to expand, with its Chief Executive Franck Riboud saying it did not have the firepower to mount big deals which would seem to rule out an eventual move for Mead Johnson.

The Pfizer unit is a high-growth USD 2.1 billion turnover business with over 70% of sales in emerging markets and a key position in China, and has attracted the attention of the three largest players in the infant milk formula sector.

Pfizer put the business up for sale last July following its USD 68 billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009, while it is also looking to offload its animal health business and says this is more likely to be spun off than sold outright.

A spokesman for Vevey-based Nestle, which holds its annual general meeting in Lausanne on Thursday and releases first-quarter sales figures on Friday, said ""we never comment on market rumours"".

Analysts said if the deal is concluded it would be positive for Nestle and also may help Danone's shares as there has been concern that the French group might pay a huge price for the business and massively leverage up its balance sheet.

""Overall, this deal makes huge strategic sense for Nestle. It is in the right categories and the right markets and with a reasonable price we would expect a fairly positive response from investors,"" said analyst Andrew Wood at Bernstein.

Nestle shares were off 0.3% at 56.60 Swiss francs and Danone up 1% at 53.61 euros by 1030 GMT.

WORLD NUMBER 5

The Pfizer business with its SMA Gold brand ranks as world number five in the infant milk formula market - the world's fastest growing packaged food category - after Nestle, Mead Johnson, Danone and Abbott Laboratories .

It is currently growing sales at 8% a year and has some 60% of its revenue in Asia, 30% in Europe, largely in Britain, and some 10% in Latin America.

Over a quarter of its sales are in China, where the USD 6 billion market is expected to double by 2016 having grown at more than 20% over the last five years to feed 16 million new births a year. A Pfizer deal would push Nestle to No 3 in the Chinese market behind Mead Johnson and Danone from its current relatively small presence.

Nestle, whose main baby milk brand is NAN, is likely to have to sell 25% of the Pfizer unit's sale by disposing of interests in Latin America, south east Asia, Australia and South Africa, which analysts say could be bought by Danone or Heinz , although Bernstein's Wood says the sell-off figure could be as high as 35% of annual sales.

Danone has always declined any comment, but Riboud said in February he was interested in acquisitions but did not have the firepower for deals on the scale of its 12.3 billion euro acquisition of baby food group Numico in 2007.

Mead Johnson share closed on Tuesday at USD 83.61 giving it a market capitalisation of around USD 17 billion, making it a potentially more expensive acquisition than Numico.

If Nestle pays USD 10 billion for the Pfizer business it would be on a similar 22 times multiple of core EBITDA profit that Danone paid for Numico and ahead of the 15.7 times Nestle paid for babyfood group Gerber in a USD 5.5 billion deal in 2007.

On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer is near to selling the business to Nestle for at least USD 9 billion in a deal that could be announced as soon as next week.

The auction is being run out of New York with Morgan Stanley and Centerview Partners advising Pfizer."
"April 18, 2012 11:22 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/-1877141.html,"By: Mark Kramer, Lalitha Vaidyanathan, Patty Russell, Samuel Kim/Forbes India

By creating shared value, companies can deliver profits while also serving societyCan the Indian private sector, especially its largest corporations, meaningfully contribute to inclusive growth? Our view is a resounding YES: We believe it is both possible and necessary for companies to fill this role… BUT, only if we move away from the prevailing paradigm of charity and corporate social responsibility (CSR).Redistributing 1 percent or 2 percent of net profits through philanthropy will never fully meet India’s needs. Only leveraging the true potential of capitalism can solve our society’s most critical problems—that is, through business initiatives that create shared value by delivering profits while also serving society.This has two important implications: First, society must accept the idea that companies can make money from addressing the needs of the poor.Second, business must strive for a higher form of capitalism, one that sees beyond short-term financial returns to create economic value in a way that also creates value for society.In January 2011, I, along with FSG’s co-founder Michael Porter, captured this thinking in a Harvard Business Review article entitled ‘Creating Shared Value’. We argue that by viewing value creation narrowly as the optimisation of short-term financial performance, companies are missing the most important customer needs and the broader influences that determine their long-term success. Business acting as business, and not as charitable donors, is the most powerful force for addressing the pressing issues we face. This is the next major transformation in business thinking that will drive future innovation and productivity growth in the global economy.India’s private sector is uniquely positioned to catalyse this transformation. Every day we come face-to-face with the myriad of society’s issues—poverty, lack of access to healthcare, poor quality education, and so on. Companies exist in a veritable laboratory that can be used to experiment, innovate and develop solutions for these problems.Companies in India who are exploiting this unique positioning to create shared value include Britannia, Nestle and Novartis.Britannia is re-conceiving its Milk-Bikis and Tiger biscuits, by fortifying them with iron to fight a key driver of malnutrition in children. In Moga (Punjab), Nestle has reconfigured its value chain for milk, a critical input to its products, by providing refrigerated collection points, new plant stock, technical assistance, financing and other supports that enable smallholder farmers to increase the quantity and quality of milk. Through regular payments and higher prices for better quality, Nestle has dramatically raised the standard of living for tens of thousands of farmers while creating a sustainable supply chain for its products.Novartis is deploying hundreds of health educators in villages to increase awareness and education around common ailments such as diarrhoea and diabetes—and to create a market for its drugs to treat those maladies.Unfortunately, Britannia, Nestle and Novartis are the exception rather than the rule. FSG’s decade-long work in Corporate Responsibility points to four major misconceptions that hold Indian companies back from adopting a shared value approach.Many companies may meet social needs as a by-product of their normal course of business. However, realising the full potential of shared value and the new business opportunities that lay hidden in social problems requires companies to develop an intentional strategy and execution plan.For example, any company that sells drip irrigation systems inherently creates some degree of shared value by reducing water use in resource constrained areas. The business opportunity is limited however, as smallholder farmers that constitute 75 percent of India’s agricultural landscape lack the technical skills and the upfront capital to install drip irrigation, even though the increase in crop yields would easily repay their investment.Only by addressing these issues head-on can a company turn what is an incidental social benefit into an opportunity that maximises the impact on society and business.This is exactly what Jain Irrigation, the country’s largest provider of drip irrigation, did.Jain devised a novel strategy that couples their product with technical assistance and innovative financing options. The results have been phenomenal: Jain’s solutions have resulted in annual increase to farmer incomes of up to $1,000, while enabling Jain to build a $400 million micro-irrigation business that commands an impressive 50 percent market share.The most successful instances of creating shared value, like Jain, require intention and focus. Companies that rise to this challenge will find that they are creating a lasting competitive advantage for themselves, while contributing toward more inclusive growth for the country.How can these opportunities be discovered? They typically lie in the spaces society has labelled “market failures”, where the consumer’s ability to pay does not sufficiently cover the usual costs of profitably developing, producing and delivering products or services.__PAGEBREAK__Shared value companies look beyond these constraints by reinventing their products, delivery mechanisms and business models.This kind of innovation requires getting close to the problem. At first, GE was unsuccessful in developing a low-cost neonatal incubator for rural India. Such a device had the potential to eliminate the leading cause of infant mortality, but GE’s existing incubator sold in the US for $20,000 and conventional R&D efforts could only bring the cost down to $2,000—still much too expensive for the Indian rural healthcare market.Ultimately, GE partnered with a social enterprise called Embrace, who unencumbered by the legacy of an existing product line, had developed a novel solution: A sleeping bag with a wax pouch that could be heated without a continuous supply of electricity. It costs just $200 or a mere 1 percent of the original incubator price.While developing such solutions is not easy to do, companies who are successful create lasting competitive advantage by being first in the market and creating formidable barriers to entry for competitors.It cannot be denied that developing shared value solutions is hard work, and that India’s rapidly expanding economy offers many opportunities to serve more immediately profitable customer segments such as the growing middle-class and the affluent. These obvious opportunities, however, are being pursued by many competing companies. The most successful companies recognise that they must also devote some portion of their resources to longer-term investments that can create a more lasting competitive advantage.It requires companies to not only invest in developing new products and services but simultaneously develop new delivery channels, reinvent business models, develop innovative marketing strategies to create demand in new markets and perhaps most challengingly, partner with government and NGOs in ways that corporations are not used to doing in their normal course of business.As with any long-term strategy, shared value investments require strong support from the highest level of company leadership. It also requires top leadership to re-evaluate the culture in which companies do business, particularly around being patient, allowing room for failure, and adjusting incentives to encourage creative thinking.For example, Andrew Witty, CEO of GlaxoSmithKline, changed the company’s strategy away from high margins towards sales volume, market share and a greater focus on delivering products of value. As a result, the company has created the Developing Countries and Market Access unit to directly build business in the world’s least developed countries where the sales volume is greatest. This type of support has had the effect of empowering business units to consider new opportunities in developing markets that would not have been considered before. Similarly, Paul Polman, the CEO of Unilever, has publicly committed to doubling sales while increasing its social impact.Polman has committed to three ways in which the company will achieve this: By improving health and well-being (better sanitation, increased nutrition), decoupling growth from environmental impact (absolute reduction in footprint even while the company grows), and enhancing livelihoods of people in the value chain (smallholder agriculture productivity improvements, employing the poor in distribution).A key element of successful championing is the setting of goals without which such commitments could remain aspirational statements. Polman’s commitments are backed with specific goals. For example, the CEO has committed to cutting 50 percent of water use in its manufacturing process and in the amount its customers use in consuming its product. That is, the company is committing to cut in half the water customers use to wash clothes with its detergent Persil, or wash their hair with its Dove shampoo.By creating a culture that embeds social impact into the company’s core strategy, and then setting specific goals around it, Polman has spurred innovation in the company in everything from packaging to advertising (e.g. for public education on sanitation) to distribution (e.g. rural distribution using impoverished village women in India).India’s mixed history with microfinance certainly supports the concern that when business profits from providing services to the poor, things can go very wrong. The debacle gave us at FSG who had been so strongly advocating for the shared value approach reason to pause and reflect. As we debated the issue, it became painfully clear that not all shared value ideas actually end up creating shared value.Shared value is created only when business value is created by solving the social problem. When business value is created at the expense of solving the social problem, we end up with what we saw in microfinance.__PAGEBREAK__What happened in microfinance was that the twin pillars on which the industry was built—income generation (which would enable borrowers to repay loans of 30 percent interest) and social capital (encouraging repayment through self-help groups)—were undermined as microfinance institutions (MFIs) chased growth. MFIs began to define their role as credit delivery institutions and focussed on standardising products and delivery processes to achieve scale more rapidly. They were no longer focussed on social value creation.Successful shared value companies understand that lasting competitive advantage is only maximised when the activity meaningfully and continually addresses the social problem. As such, best-in-class shared value companies are zealous about measuring and holding themselves accountable for both the financial and social impact of their shared value activity.Here again, Jain Irrigation serves as an excellent example. Jain is rigorous about measuring the social impact of its activities by monitoring yield increase and farmer income. Jain then uses this information, together with its understanding of smallholder agriculture issues, to develop new products and services which further boost farmer income and expand business opportunities. For example, Jain discovered that smallholder farmers had difficulty obtaining loans to invest in yield-increasing solutions. Thus, Jain decided to contract purchase the crops upfront. It enabled farmers to use the purchase obligation contracts to obtain loans and created a whole new market for Jain—food processing.Myth 4: “Creating shared value means there is no longer any role for CSR and corporate philanthropy.”Shared Value does not replace the need for companies to fulfil their basic social responsibilities and obligation to be good citizens in their communities. Companies still need to ensure that they have good governance, reduce the harm caused to the environment and society as a result of their business operations (e.g. conserving water tables, resettling affected communities, minimising carbon footprint), treat their employees well, ensure product safety, and so on. Companies will also need to continue to be responsive to the needs of their immediate communities, for example during times of disaster.Shared value does not relieve companies from these types of basic responsibilities.However, the above mentioned efforts are limited in their ability to achieve large-scale social impact. India’s very best examples of highly strategic corporate philanthropy efforts—take the programmes that operate free primary and secondary schools at scale—reach hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries when the need is often in the millions. Corporate philanthropy typically accounts for only a small fraction of net profits (typically 1 percent) and as such will always be limited in its scale, sustainability and ultimate impact.Ultimately, sustained social change is most likely to occur through a seamless integration into the business strategy itself.It stems from the fundamental belief that when society thrives, the business also thrives.In our experience, best-in-class companies take a portfolio approach whereby resources are allocated across three categories, each of which fulfils a different objective: (1) exercising good corporate citizenship by meeting community obligations (2) fulfilling basic business responsibility by mitigating harm from business operations and (3) proactively creating large-scale social impact through shared value activities.Companies that have CSR or philanthropic resources over and beyond that expended for meeting community obligations could leverage these resources for incubating shared value opportunities.For example, the medical device manufacturer, Medtronic, provides grants to increase patient awareness and provider education, ultimately contributing to a stronger health system in a market where their products may be used.By using philanthropic capital for shared value, those investments can have a longer time horizon that isn’t subject to the strict return on investments, nor the profit and loss constraints of the business unit. Sometimes by coming from the corporate foundation rather than the company itself, companies have found it easier to gain trust and develop partnerships.Philanthropic initiatives provide opportunities for companies to learn how to partner and work in new environments.As Indian companies increasingly go global, the innovations discovered through their shared value initiatives can arm them with the competitive advantage and leadership position necessary to succeed on the world stage.(Kramer co-founded FSG with Professor Michael Porter and is a managing director with the firm.

Angel Broking has come out with its report on FMCG space. The research believe Britannia and HUL will have an adverse impact of this regulation, whereas Dabur, Nestle and GSKCH will largely comply with the proposed

regulation.

Recently the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution issued a notification on 19 consumer product categories to be sold in standardized pack sizes with effect from July 1, 2012. In our view, this regulation by the Government of India will have a negative impact on the FMCG companies in our universe.FMCG companies have always resorted to tinkering with the pack sizes to manage the slippage in operating margins during a high raw-material inflationary scenario. If this regulation is implemented, then these companies will have to stick to standard pack sizes. Also, some companies according to the notification might have to introduce new pack sizes in few product categories.We believe the impact would be more on products that come in the following price points - `1, `2, `5, `10, because companies normally do not tinker with these price points but make changes in the pack sizes in order to protect the fall in margins when witnessing high raw-material prices. Product categories where this regulation will have an adverse impact are biscuits, tea and soaps and detergents.If this regulation is implemented, FMCG companies might have to do away with these popular price points, as taking price hikes by reducing the grammage at these price points will no more be possible. These pack sizes have become very popular among rural markets, which for all FMCG companies have become a sizeable market. We believe Britannia and HUL will have an adverse impact of this regulation, whereas Dabur, Nestle and GSKCH will largely comply with the proposed regulation.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Swiss FMCG firm Nestle announced the rebranding of its existing milk and yoghurt products as 'Nestle a+' in India as it looks to ride on the quality plank to drive sales in the country.

""The existing Nestle Milk has a consumer preference and has being doing well. We now want to take it to the next level. Relevant branding is one key element in communicating with consumers,"" Nestle India Dairy Business General Manager Kumaran Nowuram told reporters here.

The re-branding exercise, which includes company's milk and yoghurt would replace the company's current milk of the company across the country, he added.

""We have launched 'Nestle a+' to emphasise and make consumers aware of the stringent standards that we ensure to provide high quality milk and dahi,"" Nowuram said.

The prices will remain unchanged for both the products, he said.

With the re-branding, the company is looking to accelerate sales growth in the category as the dairy business is becoming a more significant part of Nestle's business, he said.

Priced at Rs 57 per litre, the milk product will have a shelf life of four months. The yoghurt, under 'a+ dahi' brand will be available in two packs of 400 gram and 200, priced at Rs 38 and Rs 18 respectively.

Apart from milk and yoghurt, Nestle sells popular products like Maggi noodles, Nescafe and KitKat chocolates in India."

We believe the recent correction in its share price provides a good entry point for long-term investors. The stock offers an upside potential of 33% at our SOTP-based target price of Rs 216 vs. consensus target of Rs 210.

JAGRAN PRAKASHAN

(JPL): BUY, TP-Rs 148 (35% upside)

Our FY13 revenue estimate is 5% below consensus. However, our FY13 EPS estimate of Rs 8 is in-line with estimates. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 148 (18xFY13E EPS).

JYOTHY LABORATORIES

: BUY, TP-Rs 212 (53% upside)

Our estimates for FY13 are among the highest on the street, led by expectation of better performance of the core business and sustainability of Henkel's profitable performance. We assign 16x to FY13E earnings and add Rs 12/share NPV on tax saving of Rs 1.2bn @12% discount rate to derive the TP of Rs 212.

Our FY12 and FY13 earnings forecast are Rs 45.7 and Rs 52.9 respectively. Our FY12 earning estimate is in line with the consensus estimate. We value M&M at Rs 898 using SOTP methodology, discounting the standalone business at 13x FY13E earnings.

Our estimates and target price are lower than the consensus, led by the expectation of pressure on EBITDA margin and argument of narrowing down of the Nestle's valuation premium. We assign P/E of 30x on the next 12-months earnings to derive TP of Rs 3,578.

NIIT TECH

: BUY, TP-Rs 285 (36% upside)

Our top-line estimate for FY12 is higher by 2.7% than consensus and marginally higher by 1.3% than consensus for FY13. Our EBITDA margin estimates are marginally lower by 40bps and 50bps for FY12 and FY13 respectively. Our EPS estimate for FY12 is marginally higher by 0.6% than consensus but EPS estimate for FY13 is 3.9% lower than consensus.

PHOENIX MILLS

: BUY, TP-Rs 265 (27% upside)

Our EPS estimates for FY12 and FY13 are Rs 10.8 and Rs 16.0, respectively. Our FY12 earnings estimate is 30% higher than consensus estimate of Rs 8.3. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 265, which discounts FY12E gross NAV by 15%.

POWER GRID

: BUY, TP-Rs 120 (15% upside)

Our FY12 & FY13 PAT estimates are in line with consensus. We value PGCIL on FCFE basis to arrive at a target price of Rs 120 (terminal growth rate 3% and 13% Ke).

SINTEX INDUSTRIES

: BUY, TP-Rs 240 (118% upside)

Our earnings estimates (EPS) for FY12 and FY13 are Rs 20.2 and Rs 23.6, respectively. Our FY12 earnings estimate is 1% higher than consensus estimate of Rs 19.9. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 240, which discounts FY12E earnings by 12x.

TECPRO SYSTEMS

: BUY, TP-Rs 375 (75% upside)

We expect EPS of Rs 31 and Rs 37.4 in FY12E and FY13E, respectively, almost in line with consensus forecasts. We expect 9% growth in order inflow in FY12, whereas some analysts forecast de-growth of ~30-35%. However, the management has guided for ~30% growth in order inflow in FY12. We have a BUY recommendation with a target price of Rs 375 (10x FY13E).

For the quarter ended Sep 2010 the sales turnover was Rs 1,641.40 crore and net profit was Rs 218.56 crore.

"October 20, 2011 02:52 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/-2045725.html,"The world's biggest food group Nestle said weakening consumer sentiment in developed markets would make it harder to improve margins as it raised its sales growth outlook for 2011 after beating forecasts for the first nine months.

The Swiss company said price hikes and strong demand in emerging markets allowed it, like other big European food groups, to make up for weakening consumer sentiment in the mature markets of Western Europe and the United States.

The maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Nespresso coffee capsules softened its optimism about margins, however, saying it was looking for an increase this year following a more confident tone at its half-year results in August

""For the year as a whole, in spite of input cost pressures, we expect to slightly over-perform against our long-term organic growth range of 5-6 percent and continue to strive for a margin improvement in constant currencies,"" Chief Executive Paul Bulcke said in a statement on Thursday.

Underlying sales at the owner of brands such as Perrier, Maggi, Carnation and Nescafe rose 7.3%, down from 7.5% in the first half, but beating forecasts for a 7.1% rise in a Reuters poll.

""Very solid set of figures with a clear beat of consensus at the organic growth and raises its guidance,"" Kepler Capital Markets analyst Jon Cox said. He noted Nestle had tweaked its margin outlook comment to say it is ""striving"" for an increase in constant currencies. ""That may raise some eyebrows.""

Asked about this change in wording, Nestle Investor Relations head Roddy Child-Villiers said: ""Consumer sentiment has turned down in Europe and the United States. So if we say 'striving', we're just taking into account the tougher environment.""

""We're still committed to the Nestle model and working to achieve a margin improvement,"" he told a conference call.

Nestle shares fell 1% to 51.05 francs by 0805 GMT, in line with the STOXX 600 Europe food & beverages index.

GLOOMY CONSUMERS

Nestle achieved volume growth of 4.1% and raised prices by 3.2% between January and September. It said in a presentation the underlying sales growth contribution was more weighted to pricing as the year progressed.

Child-Villiers confirmed this year's input costs would increase at the upper end of a 2.5-3 billion francs range.

Emerging markets remained the growth driver with 13.1% underlying sales growth and Child-Villiers said there was no sign of a slowdown in these markets, including China.

Nestle spoke, however, of a challenging environment in developed markets which only grew 4.0%.

Vontobel's Jean-Philippe Bertschy noted a slowdown in Europe in the third quarter to 3.4% underlying sales growth from 7.7% in the second quarter.

""Water was particularly hit due to unfavourable weather in Europe with a flat volume growth in the third quarter.""

Overall sales in Swiss francs fell 15.1%, severely impacted by the franc's strength versus other currencies, to 60.9 billion Swiss francs, short of the 61.9 billion franc forecast in the Reuters poll.

Nestle shares, which have lost about 6% so far this year, compared with a 3.6% drop in the sector index, trade at about 15.9 times estimated 2012 earnings, at a premium to Danone on 14.4 and Unilever on 14.1.

""Dogs' hearing is twice as sharp as humans.

"August 10, 2011 03:10 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/-2122933.html,"The world's biggest food group Nestle raised its full-year outlook after strong demand for its Maggi and Nescafe brands in emerging markets helped it post a forecast-beating 7.5% rise in underlying first-half sales.

The Vevey-based maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Nespresso portioned coffee said on Wednesday it expected full-year underlying sales growth at the top end of its long-term target range of 5-6% along with higher margins in constant currencies.

""Nestle continued to make good progress in a period characterised by political and economic instability, natural disasters, rising raw material prices and, yes, a strong Swiss franc,"" Chief Executive Paul Bulcke said in a statement.

The group said it expected conditions to remain challenging in 2011 due to these factors as well as subdued consumer confidence in the developed world, but said its momentum was strong and pricing should help more in the second half.

Price increases of 3.8% in the second quarter, up from 1.5% in the first quarter, helped Nestle to partly offset soaring costs for raw materials such as coffee, cocoa and sugar, which hit 30-year highs earlier this year.

Nestle said it decided not to launch a new share buyback programme, which had been expected by many analysts, partly due to the tough economic environment and also to keep cash available for possible bolt-on acquisitions.

Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said this would stoke rumours of Nestle being interested in Pfizer's nutrition business which is up for sale.

A spokeswoman for Nestle declined to comment on Nestle's possible interest in the baby food business on Tuesday.

Unlike its peers, Nestle also has to deal with a huge rise in its reporting currency, the Swiss franc, which chopped 13.8% off sales. Sales fell to 41 billion francs (USD 55.4 billion), in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll.

""A stronger than expected set of figures driven by pricing and ongoing strong results in Asia -- I expect the stock to react positively,"" Kepler Capital Markets analyst Jon Cox said.

Nestle shares were indicated to open 2.5% higher, according to pre-market data . They had lost 15% so far this year, underperforming a 5% drop in the STOXX Europe 600 Food & Beverage index.

Price increases helped rivals Kraft Foods and Unilever post better than expected second-quarter results last week. At yoghurt maker Danone, however, they led to lower dairy sales volumes."

Nestle, the world's largest food company, is paying a hefty USD 1.7 billion for a 60% stake in candy maker Hsu Fu Chi International to move deeper into fast-growing markets in China.

Nestle's biggest deal in China so far will take it closer to its target of 45% of sales from emerging markets in about 10 years, and analysts said on Monday securing growth opportunities in China was worth a relatively high price.""It is certainly not cheap but that is the price you have to pay to get access to this high-growth market,"" Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said.""The fact that Hsu Chen will continue to lead the company is also very positive because he must be very well linked and have a well-established distribution network,"" he said.Kepler Capital Markets analyst Jon Cox said: ""The deal makes strategic sense as, inevitably, China will become the biggest market for confectionery in the future. It looks a bit expensive at first glance at 3.5 times sales. But you are paying for the future growth prospect.""The Vevey-based maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee strengthened its dairy business in China earlier this year when taking a 60%stake in Yinlu Foods Group for an undisclosed sum.""Together with Yinlu Foods and Hsu Fu chi, Nestle will increase its Chinese business from around 2.8 billion Swiss francs (USD 3.35 billion) in 2010 to 4.2 billion francs,"" Helvea analyst Andreas von Arx said, adding China could become Nestle's fifth-biggest market.Nestle shares were down 0.3% at 1000 GMT, in line with the European food and beverage sector.Hsu Fu Chi, which makes sugar sweets, cereal-based snacks, cakes and the traditional Chinese snack sachima, is listed in Singapore and reported sales of 669 million Swiss francs in 2010. It employs 16,000 people.""The outlook for China's consumption demand is quite positive,"" said Dan Bin, a fund manger at Shenzhen-based Eastern Bay Investment Management, which invests in Chinese consumer companies. ""Nestle has a lot of experience in consumer brands and with the deal, they can build on what Hsu Fu Chi already has in the Chinese market.""Under their agreement, Nestle will buy 43.5 percent of Hsu Fu Chi's shares from independent shareholders at S$4.35, a premium of 8.7 percent over the July 1 closing price -- trading in the Dongguan-based company's shares were halted on July 1 when the companies said they were in talks.If the scheme is approved by the independent shareholders, Nestle will acquire a 16.5 percent stake from the Hsu family, which founded the company in 1992 and leaving it with 40 percent. The company will then be delisted.

APPROVAL

The deal, for which Credit Suisse advised Nestle, requires approval from China's commerce ministry and authorities from Cayman Islands, where the company is incorporated, Hsu Fu Chi spokeswoman Christine Sun said.""There are some concerns, especially after Coca-Cola's failed bid for Huiyuan. There is a sense that the Chinese government might be trying to protect Chinese brands,"" Shaun Rein, managing director at China Market Research Group, said.""I would think that, in this case, it would not be a problem because we estimate the candy company only has about a 5.5 percent of the market, so it is a fairly niche market, and it is also a Taiwanese brand.""The approval process will likely take 3-5 months, a source close to the deal said.Investors have worried that foreign bids for well-known Chinese brands were off the table since Chinese regulators blocked Coca-Cola's $2.4 billion bid in 2009 for the country's top juice maker, Huiyuan Juice.However, British drinks group Diageo won approval last month to increase its stake in Sichuan Shuijingfang, China's fourth largest white spirits group.Nestle's offer came at a time when a series of accounting scandals at foreign-listed Chinese companies have triggered a sell-off in China-based stocks, prompting owners to consider mergers or partnerships.Shares of Chinese companies listed in Singapore, known as S-chips, trade at a discount to their Singapore counterparts, which is forcing controlling shareholders to seek exits, said Tan Han Meng, an analyst at DMG & Partners.The FT ST China Index, which tracks shares of Chinese companies listed in Singapore, has fallen 11 percent since the start of the year, versus the Straits Times Index's 1.9 percent fall.($1 = 1.221 Singapore dollars = 0.836 Swiss francs)(Additional reporting by Lee Chyen Yee, Charmian Kok and Rachel Armstrong; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott and Dan Lalor)"

Nestle, the world's largest food company, offered to buy 60% of Chinese candies and pastries group Hsu Fu Chi International for about USD 1.7 billion to expand in one of the world's biggest consumer markets.

The Hsu family, which owns 56.48% of the Singapore-listed company, will sell a 16.48% stake to Nestle, but the family will retain 40% in the firm under a joint venture deal, Hsu Fu Chi said in a statement.

The deal comes at a time when a series of accounting scandals at foreign-listed Chinese companies has triggered a widespread sell-off in China-based stocks and is prompting owners to consider mergers or partnerships.

""The investment is good for Nestle as Hsu Fu Chi has a very good distribution network in China and a decent brand profile, with 6 percent of the market share in China's candy market,"" said Tan Han Meng, an analyst at DMG & Partners.

Shares of Chinese companies listed in Singapore, known as S-chips, trade at a discount to their Singapore counterparts, which is forcing controlling shareholders to seek exits, he said.

""We've seen fair amount of delisting, with shareholders taking the companies private. At this time S-chips as a whole have been affected by the negative sentiment from recent scandals,"" Tan said.

""For investors looking at the long term, some of them may look deeper into companies that have been unfairly punished to find valuable gems.""

The agreement would still require approval from China's commerce ministry, Cayman Island courts, where the company is incorporated, and shareholders, Hsu Fu Chi spokeswoman Christine Sun said from Dongguan in China's southern Guangdong province.

""If the Chinese commerce ministry doesn't give approval, we won't be able to go ahead with the joint venture. Even if the shareholders agree to the delisting, we ultimately will still need the commerce ministry's approval,"" she told Reuters.

Nestle will also buy 43.52% from shareholders such as Baring Private Equity and asset manager Arisaig and together with the Hsu family will seek to delist the firm.

Foreign bids

The deal, which values Hsu Fu Chi at S$3.46 billion, comes a few weeks after British drinks group Diageo won approval to raise its stake in Sichuan Shuijingfang, China's fourth largest white spirits group.

The Diageo deal raised hopes that foreign bids for well-known Chinese brands are possible, which had became a concern two years ago when Chinese regulators blocked Coca-Cola's USD 2.4 billion bid for the country's top juice maker, Huiyuan Juice.

Nestle has no intention to make major changes to the business or cut jobs, Hsu Fu Chi said.

Dongguan-based Hsu Fu Chi makes snacks such as peanut candies, pop jellies and sachima rice snacks.

The company's shares were up 9.8% on Monday after a trading halt, which was in place since July 1, was lifted.

Analysts have said in the past it would make sense for Nestle to buy a company in an emerging market due to sluggish sales at home.

Nestle has been sitting on a pile of cash since it sold its remaining stake in eyecare group Alcon. In April, it said it planned to take a 60% stake in China's Yinlu Foods Group for an undisclosed price.

Credit Suisse advised Nestle. The directors of the Singapore-listed company plan to appoint an independent financial adviser.

UBS has maintained a ""NEUTRAL"" stance on Patni Computer, however, it has cut the target to Rs 380 from Rs 475. They believe that the benefits from the iGate and Patni integration are unlikely to have meaningful impact over the next few quarters. They expect the lower free float and the lack of clarity on delisting to continue to weigh heavily on the stock, limiting upside.

CLSA has maintained an ""OUTPERFORM"" rating on United Spirits with a target of Rs 1,125.

They believe current valuations price in volume growth and increasing margins, which we see as unlikely given high competition and input costs.Citi has a ""BUY"" recommendation on DB Corp with a target price of Rs 305.

Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever will need four to five years of growth to catch up with rivals such as Procter & Gamble and Nestle, its chief executive told a Dutch paper.

""We have lost the connection with the world top. If we want to grow consistently the next five years and again want to become one of the bigger companies, we have to change the culture,"" CEO Paul Polman is quoted as saying on Thursday in Dutch financial daily Het Financieele Dagblad.The maker of Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Dove soaps has grown too little in the past 10 to 15 years and therefore did not create enough shareholder value, Polman said.Unilever wants to double its sales on the long term, Polman said.""The market wants to see more than a good quarter before believing Unilever has truly changed. We still have much to prove,"" Polman is quoted as saying."
