Pharmaceutical major Sun Pharma's healthy Q2 backed by its industry-beating performance in the domestic market and stellar global specialty sales have impressed brokerages across the board, prompting some of them to raise their target prices for the stock. Brokerages like Nuvama Institutional Equities and Citi have raised their price targets for Sun Pharma post its Q2 results.

The drugmaker reported a 5 percent on year jump in its Q2 net profit to Rs 2,375.5 crore while its revenue rose 11.3 percent to Rs 12,192 crore. Not just that, the net profit as well as revenue also topped the Street's estimate of Rs 2,316.7 crore and Rs 12,047.6 crore, respectively.

The growth in earnings was backed by a 19.2 percent spike in global specialty sales along with an around 11 percent rise in India formulation sales. Its worth noting that the drugmaker delivered a healthy set of earnings despite a sequential decline in its US sales.

Meanwhile, the drugmaker is also focused on securing its next leg of growth and hence, has maintained its R&D (Research and Development) guidance of 7-8 percent for FY24. The management also revealed that the dispatches from Mohali have resumed post-implementation of the corrective measures, which should aid growth in US sales going ahead.

Brokerage firm Citi raised its price target for the stock by over 8 percent to Rs 1,380 as it believes a potential recovery in the US generics segment suggests a better margin outlook for the drugmaker. Accordingly, the firm also raised its FY24/25 earnings estimates by 9 percent and 4 percent, respectively.

Nuvama was another brokerage that increased its price target for the stock, albeit marginally, to Rs 1,330 while retaining its 'buy' call on Sun Pharma. ""We are more confident on the drugmaker's potential given a steady Q2 even as opex rose sharply and Revlimid (cancer drug) contribution dipped, much-awaited India recovery seems to materialise as it gains share and posts double-digit growth,"" Nuvama stated in a note.

""Specialty seems to be progressing well, shall see Winlevi (acne drug) and Sezaby (seizure drug) boost from FY25 and potential approval of deuruxolitinib (to treat alopecia areata) by FY26, Halol products have started to regain share and Mohali shall gradually inch toward normalcy,"" the brokerage added.

Macquarie also remains positive on Sun Pharma's specialty portfolio as it sees major products including Ilumya, Winlevi, and Cequa witnessing encouraging prescription growth trends. The brokerage retained its 'outperform' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,275.

Global brokerage firm Jefferies also sees a ramp-up in Sun Pharma's specialty sales and strong presence in the India/Emerging Markets as key drivers for the drugmaker's core earnings growth. Jefferies has a 'buy' call on Sun Pharma with a target price of Rs 1,310.

Motilal Oswal also remains bullish on Sun Pharma's growth prospects as it retained its 'buy' rating for the stock, assigning it a price target of Rs 1,310.

Zydus Lifesciences Limited and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Sun Pharma) have entered into a licensing agreement to co-market an innovative drug for anaemia linked to kidney ailments.

Desidustat is the first-of-its-kind oral treatment for anemia associated with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) in India, the drug makers said.

Under the terms of the agreement, Zydus has granted Sun Pharma semi-exclusive rights to comarket the product in India under the brand name RYTSTAT. Zydus had launched the drug under the brand name Oxemia in 2022 and will continue to market it.

Zydus will receive an upfront licensing income and receive incomes based on achievement of pre-defined milestones. “Desidustat, which is one of the critical treatment options for CKD patients, has substantially improved the patients’ quality of life since it is more convenient to take an oral pill, instead of an injection that needs to be administered. We are pleased to join hands with Sun Pharma to expand the reach of this novel medicine by enabling access to more patients,” said a spokesperson for Zydus Lifesciences Ltd.

Kirti Ganorkar, CEO - India Business, Sun Pharma said: “This partnership will allow greater access to a critical therapy, helping millions of patients suffering from chronic kidney diseases.”

More than 115 million people in India suffer from CKD, which is predicted to become one of the most common causes of premature death by 2040 globally. Patients with CKD often have to battle chronic fatigue caused by anaemia. To address this, patients need to take injectable erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) about twice weekly. HIF-PH inhibitors like Desidustat bridge the need for an oral, safer alternative to ESAs.

It reduces the burden of managing the disease by providing treatment at an affordable cost along with ease of convenience.

Chronic kidney disease is a serious, progressive medical condition characterised by a gradual loss of kidney function, usually accompanied by other comorbidities including anaemia, cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, heart failure and stroke), diabetes mellitus, eventually leading to kidney failure.

CKD patients are often on multiple medications and have increased risk of drug interactions. The clinical development programme of Desidustat was one of the largest trials of its kind in India for anemia in CKD patients, conducted in over 1,200 subjects."

Sun Pharma has entered into a license agreement with Pharmazz Inc, a US-based biopharmaceutical company, to commercialise Tyvalzi (Sovateltide) in India.

Sovateltide is indicated for treating cerebral ischemic stroke. As per agreement terms, Sun Pharma is granted rights for marketing Sovateltide in India under the brand name Tyvalzi™ (Sovateltide), the company said in the press statement. Pharmazz will be entitled to upfront and milestone payments, including royalties, the statement added.

Kirti Ganorkar, CEO (India Business) of Sun Pharma said, “The Phase III clinical trial for Tyvalzi conducted in India demonstrated statistically and clinically meaningful improvement in neurological outcomes in ischemic stroke. Tyvalzi helps improve the quality of life of stroke patients. The drug can be administered within 24 hours for the treatment of ischemic stroke. The current treatment options provide a narrow time window of 4-5 hours limiting its use in most patients.”

""There is an urgent need for new therapies to treat stroke, the 2nd leading cause of mortality & morbidity worldwide,"" BS Paul, a neuro-physician who

was a part of the clinical trials of Tyvalzi Sovateltide (TyvalziTM). ""Sovateltide (TyvalziTM) produced statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in neurological outcomes at 90 days post-treatment in clinical trials as measured by the NIHSS, mRS, and B.I. scales,"" he added.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on February 14, 2023, issued a proceed forward letter for Pharmazz’s investigational new drug (IND) application to commence Phase III clinical trial of Sovateltide (PMZ-1620).

According to the company press release, the ‘Global Burden of Disease Project’ estimated the number of incident cases of stroke in India to be 117.5 million. In India, studies estimate that the incidence of stroke population varies from 116 to 163 per 10 million population.

Brokerage firm Nomura and HSBC have chosen to uphold their current buy rating for Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd despite a US court ruling against the company in a patent dispute over Deuruxolitinib.

HSBC and Nomura maintain buy ratings, with HSBC increasing target price to Rs 1275 (+13.5% from earlier) and Nomura to Rs 1313 (from Rs 1138).

Analysts are optimistic about Sun's performance in key specialty brands (such as Ilumya, Winlevi, and Cequa), which are expected to boost its sales and earnings. Despite anticipating continued cost increases (like R&D and sales & marketing) to back growth plans in focused sectors (like India and specialty areas) and accounting for Halol plant remediation expenses, experts believe that strong specialty sales will aid in mitigating the margin impact.

Nomura believes that this recent development might not heavily influence the commercial potential of the product.

The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit made a decision on August 22, ruling in favour of Incyte Corp and against Sun Pharma in a patent dispute concerning deuruxolitinib, a possible treatment for Alopecia Areata (AA). This drug was obtained by Sun Pharma through its acquisition of Concert Pharma. The Federal Circuit upheld a previous ruling by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) that invalidated US patent ‘149, which covered the deuruxolitinib compound.

According to the HSBC report, the court's decision on deuruxolitinib is unlikely to affect Sun's drug development plans for AA or the FDA review process. However, it raises worries about potential sales losses due to royalty payments to Incyte. Additionally, the ruling might constrain Sun's capacity to extend deuruxolitinib into other uses, although Sun hasn't yet determined its course of action regarding other indications.

Incyte's Jakafi is authorized for myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, which are distinct from Sun's goal of treating Alopecia Areata. Therefore, HSBC anticipates that Sun can introduce the product after obtaining FDA approval. However, the specific timing of the launch is likely to hinge on various factors.

In a pessimistic scenario, HSBC envisions Sun launching deuruxo in the US after the composition patent for ruxolitinib expires in December 2027 (with pediatric exclusivity extending it until June 2028). Additionally, they consider a net present value (NPV) of zero for deuruxo for Sun in this scenario, in contrast to an NPV of Rs15 per share as assumed in their base case.

Drug firm Torrent Pharma has entered into the fray to acquire the Hamied family’s stake in Cipla in what could be the biggest pharma deal since 2014. Ahmedabad-headquartered Torrent wants to take control of the fourth-ranked pharmaceutical major that is more than double (2.3x) its FY23 consolidated revenue, 2.3 times its profit, and 1.46 times its present market value, a newspaper report has said.

More importantly, the competition for buying out the Hamied family's stake in Cipla also includes Blackstone, the largest buyout fund, and Baring PE Asia-EQT. Torrent Pharma, with advisory support from JP Morgan, is exploring options of forming a consortium with private equity funds. Preliminary discussions in this regard have already taken place with a few potential partners, the Economic Times reported.

Moneycontrol couldn't verify the report independently.

Major player

If the Torrent deal comes to fruition, it would eventually lead to the creation of India’s second biggest pharmaceutical company after Sun Pharma by revenue.

Torrent has talked to multiple lenders for funding and is willing to make an all-cash offer. Work has gained momentum in the past month, the financial daily said, citing sources. A successful transaction is likely to place Torrent Pharma ahead of Sun Pharma in the domestic formulations business.

YK Hamied and MK Hamied, both in their 80s, represent the second generation of the founding family of Cipla. While YK Hamied does not have children, MK Hamied has three children who have played various roles within the pharmaceutical giant over the years.

In 2015, Son Kamil left the company to pursue other interests. Daughter Samina Hamied, who currently holds the position of executive vice chairperson, has been overseeing the company's affairs, but has not actively involved in an operational role. Rumana Hamied has historically been engaged in CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) activities. The emergence of succession-related concerns and recent tax raids are believed to have played a huge role in the family's decision to consider a complete sale of their stake in the company, the report mentioned.

Stakeholders

The family, as promoters, holds 33.47 percent stake of the company. The current market value of Cipla is Rs 98,562.79 crore, up 16.5 percent in the past month ever since the news of a potential sale surfaced. At this market price, the promoter stake alone is estimated to be valued at Rs 32,988.9 crore ($3.97 billion). Considering the open offer for 26 per cent that has to be held under the takeover rules is fully subscribed, a new owner may end up paying a total Rs 58,615.2 crore ($7.06 billion) for a 59.47 percent stake, the financial daily said.

The Sudhir and Samir Mehta family, who are the owners of Torrent, possess a substantial 71.25-percent stake in the company, and this significant ownership gives them the flexibility to dilute their equity to raise leverage. “At the current market cap, the company can raise around Rs 26,000 crore and yet the promoters would continue to hold around 51 percent shareholding,” a person familiar with the matter told the publication."
"August 17, 2023 10:01 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/legal/delhi-hc-denies-interim-relief-to-sun-pharma-against-finecure-in-trademark-dispute-11206701.html,"Sun Pharma Delhi HC

The Delhi High Court has refused to give interim relief to pharmaceuticals giant Sun Pharma which accused Finecure Pharmaceuticals Limited of infringing the trademark of its anti-acidity drug Pantocid.

Refusing Sun Pharma’s plea to stop Fincare from using the trademark till the disposal of its infringement suit, the court said on August 16 the company filed the plea only after releasing that the rival had become a formidable player in the market even though it was aware of the situation for 13 years.

In its petition, Sun Pharma alleged that Fincecure's anti-acidity drug Pantopacid was a convenient corruption of its trademarked Pantocid and was also deceptively similar to it.

Sun Pharma said it registered trademark to use Pantocid and the sales of the Pantocid range of drugs earned it Rs 386.8 crore in 2020-21 and Rs 513.63 crore in 2021-22.

It came to know of the use of Pantopacid trademark in April 2023 and approached the court.

Finecure contended it had Pantopacid trademarked since 2007. While Sun Pharma objected to the registration of the trademark in 2010, it waited for 13 years before approaching the court. Sun Pharma was not entitled to any relief solely on account of delay in approaching the court, it argued.

Noting that Pantopacid was a pantoprazole drug, Finecure argued that “panot” referred to the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient of the drug, which was pantoprazole.

While, “P” indicated that the drug was a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI), thereby reflecting its mode of action and “acid” indicated that the drug treated acidity.

Finecure also argued that Sun Pharma's Pantocid trademark deserved to be revoked as it merely replicated, or abbreviated, the name of the pharmaceutical ingredient.

The court's observations

The court said Pantocid and Pantopacid looked and sounded alike and were used as brand names for pantoprazole.

""A customer, who seeks to buy the product to cure his acidity, and who is not well-versed with the names of drugs, is unlikely to be able to distinguish between Pantocid and Pantopacid,” it said.

The two drugs were structurally, phonetically and visually confusingly similar and Pantopacid prima facie infringed Pantocid.

What worked in Finecure’s favour

The court said while Sun Pharma contended that it came to know of Pantopacid in April 2023, it had known in 2010 that the trademark was being registered in Finecure Pharma's favour.

Sun Pharma approached the court after realising that Finecure had become a formidable market player, it said. ""The balance of convenience would, in my opinion, would clearly not justify bringing the use of 'Pontopacid', by the defendants (Finecure), of the mark to a complete halt, at this late stage,"" it said.

Sun Pharma's failure to approach the court with “clean hands” disentitled it from any injunctive relief, it said.

The court directed Finecare to maintain a separate account of its earnings and returns from the use of Pantopacid and file an affidavit every three months."

Drugmaker Sun Pharmaceuticals has not resumed supply from its Mohali plant, said company executives during the earnings call on August 3.

Further, the company clarified that it doesn’t need any inspection to restart supply from the plant. The company did not give a timeline on when the Mohali or the Halol facility will be ready inspection and the supply will restart.

In April, the Mohali plant had received a letter titled “Consent Decree Correspondence/Non-Compliance Letter"" from the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). The USFDA directed the company to take corrective actions at the Mohali facility before releasing further final product batches into the US.

Sun Pharma inherited the Mohali plant from Ranbaxy as a part of the merger in 2015. The plant supplied $100-150 million worth of products to the US. Major products manufactured in the plant include colon drug Pentasa, Protonix oral suspension (treats conditions that cause too much stomach acid, like heartburn and stomach ulcers) and Ranolazine (treats heart related chest pain).

The management also said that the subdued growth quarter due to the the national list of essential medicines (NLEM) impact. The full impact of NLEM (which was announced in Dec-Jan period), is visible in the Apr-Jun quarter. The company expects NLEM impact to subside in next 2 quarters said chief financial officer (CFO) CS Muralidharan to CNBC-TV18 in an interview on August 4.

The NLEM is a list released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The medicines listed in the NLEM are sold below a price ceiling fixed by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA). India formulation sales accounted for about 30 percent of total consolidated sales in the quarter. US accounted for over 33 percent of total consolidated sales.

The filing of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) moderated this quarter because of the ransomware attack (which happened in March) and this is expected to return to normal in the next quarters.

Regarding the acquisition of Taro, the management didn’t reveal any updates on timeline. However, they said Taro operates in a segment which faces increasing competitive pressure–dermatology. It is hard for Taro to face the competition in this segment as an independent company. This was the primary reason cited for the pending acquisition of Taro by Sun Pharma.

Taro reported sales of US$ 159 million, in the quarter under review, up by 1.4 percent YoY and net profit of about US$ 10 million, lower by 28.9 percent over net profit of Q1 last year.

Muralidharan also said that the sales in US did well on account of speciality business doing well & Revlimid sales.

The management also spoke the product pipeline and that it is accelerating the pace of the phase-3 trial of Ilumya used to treat psoriatic arthritis. Another product in pipeline GL0034 was found to reduce body weight with a single dose in obese individuals without diabetes. The phase-1 trial of the drug has been completed.

The company also had a sequential decline in speciality biz due to seasonality in levulan (used to treat actinic keratosis), Muralidharan added.

Brokerages have maintained a robust growth outlook for drugmaker Sun Pharma following the release of its April-June earnings on August 3. Though the company's net profit declined 2 percent on year to Rs 2,022.5 crore in the first quarter of the current financial year, the fall was mostly on account of an exceptional loss worth Rs 322.87 crore.

Adjusting for that, the net profit not just rose nearly 14 percent on year to Rs 2,345.4 crore but also came in well above the Street's estimate of Rs 2,119.4 crore.

The Mumbai-based drugmaker also reported an 11 percent year-on-year increase in consolidated revenue at Rs 11,941 crore, topping expectations of Rs 11,606.5 crore. The EBITDA margin also rose to 27.9 percent in the quarter under review, up 230 basis points from the same period a year ago.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Foreign brokerage Jefferies is bullish on Sun Pharma and attributed its earnings beat to higher-than-expected sales of generic blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid and lower research and development spends. Even though the firm is disappointed by the just 5 percent growth in the company's India business, it expects improvement hereon.

The brokerage also said core earnings drivers remain intact for Sun Pharma, led by a ramp-up in specialty sales. It retained its ""buy"" call on the stock, with a price target of Rs 1,310.

The firm also expects Sun Pharma’s specialty portfolio to see Winlevi and Sezaby boost from FY25 onwards. In addition, expectations of an India recovery provide long-term comfort, the firm said. On that account, Nuvama raised its FY24E/25E core EPS for Sun Pharma by 2 percent/3 percent.

The firm also raised its price target for the stock by nearly 18 percent to Rs 1,320 while maintaining its ""buy"" call .

A quick response (QR) code has been made mandatory for the top 300 widely used drug brands produced from August 1 — which will hit pharmacies over the next few weeks — as part of the Centre’s ‘track and trace’ mechanism to check the sale of counterfeit and spurious medicines, and ensure quality, a report has said.

On scanning the QR code, essential information such as manufacturing licence and batch number will facilitate the medicine’s authentication.

Reports said in the first phase from August 1, the QR code will be printed on 300 top-selling medicines, which account for about Rs 50,000 crore of the pharma retail market.

The government's move affected Dolo (Micro Labs), Allegra (Sanofi), Asthalin (Cipla), Augmentin (GSK), Unwanted 72 (Mankind Pharma), Saridon (Bayer Pharmaceuticals), Limsey (Abbott), Calpol (GSK), Corex (Pfizer), Thyronorm ( Abbott), the Business Standard reported on August 1.

The financial daily quoted Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), which represents big drug companies, as saying that the industry is ready for this. A GSK spokesperson said the company is prepared for the change and the cost has already been factored in.

Concerns

However, industry sources are of the view that because of this additional printing, the cost will go up by 5 to 7 percent and there may be a delay in the preparation of the batch.

“The industry has already met the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) and voiced its concerns. We have requested considering the fact that there will be a cost escalation due to this step, and most of these drugs are already under price control,” an anonymous source told the daily.

He added that since these are top-selling medicines and most of these drug brands belong to big companies. Therefore, it should not take long for the industry to make a switch.

Though the move was conceptualised a decade ago, it has been on the back burner because the domestic retail pharma industry was ill-prepared for the switch, and lack of requisite software and technology systems was a big challenge."

Motilal Oswal's research report on Sun Pharma

Sun Pharmaceutical and Industries (SUNP) delivered operational miss for 4QFY23 performance (on ex-milestone income basis), led by higher-thanexpected operational cost. There was a sharp uptick in gross margin, (YoY/QoQ) due to increased share of higher margin products. However, this benefit was offset to some extent due to increased promotional spent in the branded segment. We reduce our earnings estimate by 4% each for FY24/FY25 to factor in a) elevated sales/distribution cost, and b) higher R&D spent related to specialty products.



Outlook

We continue to value SUNP at 25x 12M forward earnings to arrive at a price target of INR1,160.

Shares of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd opened marginally lower on May 29 even after better-than-expected numbers for the March quarter earnings. The stock was trading at Rs 971.85 on BSE, down 0.12 percent from May 26 close.

Sun Pharma reported a net profit of Rs 1,984.5 crore for the March quarter of FY23 against a loss of Rs 2,227.38 crore in the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, Sun Pharma's net profit declined 8.3 percent from Rs 2,166 crore in the previous quarter, the company said on May 27.

Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 15.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 10,930.6 crore. The EBITDA margin came in at 25.6 percent against 24.8 percent in the year-ago period.

Global specialty grew by 31.2 percent and 3.8 percent year on year (YoY) and quarter on quarter (QoQ) to $244 million (including $6.8 million of milestone income). In FY23, the global specialty segment grew 29 percent YoY to $871 million, led by 51 percent growth in Ilumya sales to $477 million. Ilumya is used for treating plaque psoriasis, a skin disease.

Brokerages view

According to Kotak Institutional Equities, Sun Pharma's specialty portfolio is nearing the breakeven point and as sales continue to grow, the medium-term outlook for margins appears optimistic.

Kotak, which has an “add” rating on the stock, increased its target price to Rs 1,150 from the current market price.

The company's management has also guided higher research and development investments towards the specialty and US generic business, going up to 7-8 percent of sales in FY24. It has also guided topline growth in high single-digits for FY24.

Nirmal Bang said in its latest report, ""We remain positive on Sun Pharma due to the following catalysts: (i) Ramp-up of Branded/Specialty business in the US (recently acquired Deuroxolitinib would further strengthen the Specialty pipeline) (ii) Continued growth in India business (iii) Potential inorganic opportunity given the strong balance sheet, especially in Dermatology, Ophthalmology and Oncology Specialty segments and (iv) Maintenance of healthy EBITDA margin at 26-27 percent despite higher R&D spends.”

The brokerage firm has maintained “buy” rating on the stock and increased the target price by 16.3 percent to Rs 1,130 a share.

Analysts say Sun Pharma achieved impressive performance, benefiting from lucrative ventures in the US, including global specialty, as well as domestic formulations.

The company grew in the March quarter, thanks to an improved product mix, particularly in the specialty business sector. Its presence in India expanded through its branded portfolio, resulting in an increased market share, they said.

Despite Taro's less remarkable results, Sun Pharma managed to deliver an overall satisfactory performance. Sun Pharma maintains a strategic focus on its specialty business, as demonstrated by its recent acquisition of Concert, analysts said.

""We maintain buy as 1) Global specialty portfolio continues to maintain momentum, 2) Growth in India formulations from new launches and field force expansion and 3) revenue mix continues to tilt towards more remunerative businesses,” ICICI Direct has said.

The brokerage firm has increased its target price by 18 percent from its current market price to Rs 1140 a share.

Sun Pharma has proposed a buyback of the remaining shares of Taro. The move is aimed at leveraging Taro's substantial cash and cash equivalents amounting to $1.3 billion. The presence of minority interest had raised concerns, making this buyback offer a strategic step for Sun Pharma.

Sun Pharma has offered to acquire the shares beyond its 78.48 percent stake in Taro Pharmaceutical Industries for $38 per unit, it has said in a press release. Taro, which saw its shares trade up 25 percent in after-hour trading on May 26, has formed a special committee to evaluate the offer.

According to the release, the $38 per share offer represents a 32 percent premium over Taro's closing price on May 25 and a 41.5 percent premium over the average closing price of the ordinary shares over the last 60 trading days.

The proposal is for an all-cash transaction to acquire all outstanding stock of Taro, such that following the transaction, Sun Pharma will own 100 percent of the stock.

A filing by Sun Pharma in the stock exchanges stated, ""We envisage the Proposed Transaction to be consummated in the form of a reverse triangular merger under the Israeli Companies Law, 1999 (""ICL"") and practice. In this context, Purchaser shall form a wholly owned subsidiary (the ""SPV""), which shall enter into a merger agreement with Taro, with the SPV merging with and into Taro and Taro surviving the merger transaction. Consequently, Taro shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser and be de-listed from NYSE.""

It add, ""As this is a common practice in Israel, we believe that such transaction structure would benefit all stakeholders of Taro and may be performed in a swift and certain manner.""

The final approval of the transaction will be subject to various conditions, including final approval of transaction terms by Sun Pharma's management and Board of Directors; execution and delivery of binding contractual documentation to the satisfaction of all parties; approval of all the governing bodies, including the shareholders of Taro in accordance with Section 270(4) and 275 of the ICL; receipt of any third-party approvals, if needed; and receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, including from any relevant Anti-Trust Authorities to the extent required."

Intensive regulatory scrutiny by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has become a major roadblock in the way of major Indian pharmaceutical companies to attempt a rebound in the subdued US market.

A Form 483 being slapped by the US FDA with several serious observations on major manufacturing facilities of these drug-makers has turned into a daily occurrence in news headlines. So much so, that the news of the completion of inspection of any pharma manufacturing facility without observations is enough to send the company's stock ticking higher on the bourses.

In the past year, several major manufacturing facilities, including Cipla and Lupin's Pithampur units, Sun Pharma's Halol unit, Aurobindo Pharma's Anakapalli unit, Dr Reddy's Srikakulam unit, and Ipca's Piparia unit are some that have been caught in regulatory snags.

These regulatory challenges are hurting the financials of these companies, the fallout being the erosion in market share, shrinking margins and loss of revenue from the delay in launches of key drugs that have been filed from the manufacturing units under scrutiny.

Nonetheless, some pharma majors may have finally managed to find their own jugaad to deal with the heavy hunting of the US regulatory body. True to the saying, ‘Modern problems require modern solutions’, some pharma majors have rolled out plans to file key drugs from two different manufacturing sites, in what may be the safest bid to de-risk launch delays.

So, what are the chances of this becoming an industry-wide trend? Let's take a deep dive to know:

Large-cap majors roll the carpet; will others follow the path?

So far, only two major large-cap companies, namely Cipla and Sun Pharma, have chalked out plans to file key drug launches from two different sites. This will de-risk the chances of the launches getting stuck in the loop of regulatory setbacks, even if one site were to fail to pass the good manufacturing standards set by the US FDA.

That's not all. Analysts on the Street are not just cheering this decision taken by Cipla and Sun Pharma, but they also anticipate others to follow suit. Mitesh Shah, Research Analyst - Pharmaceutical Sector at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, believes that other pharma companies should also conform to the trend. His major backing is the fact that the drugs tangled in regulatory mishaps belong to the high-margin and high-revenue category, and spending some extra money in filing them from two facilities will be offset by what they will bring to the table.

On the flip side, a delay in the launch of these drugs will result in subsequent erosion of margin due to shrinking market size and eventually, loss of revenue opportunity.

A similar optimism was stated by Kunal Randeria, Director, Nuvama Institutional Equities, who cheered the de-risking plans proposed by Cipla. He believes de-risking will reduce the regulatory overhang. Though there might be some delay in the initial approval of the new sites, but once done, that will ensure a more sustainable revenue stream from these major drugs.

Some ifs, some buts

Regardless of how smooth this route looks, there are challenges too, in its way, that have thus far prevented companies from looking at the option.

One of the challenges is the technicalities involved. Vishal Manchanda, Pharma Analyst at Systematix Shares and Stocks (India), spoke of the lack of specific manufacturing abilities available at other units to produce the said drugs as being the major roadblock. Such a problem may arise especially for small and mid-size companies, with limited resources at their command.

""Some drugs require specialised manufacturing facilities which might not be available for some companies at two of their different sites, making it difficult for them to go down the path of dual filing,"" Manchanda explained.

Shah also pointed out that some companies may be of the view that given that regulatory standards are the same for all manufacturing plants, dual filing may bring little change if practices followed in the two units are exactly the same.

To answer this, another analyst on the Street spoke of the numerous complications involved in the process of getting the US FDA's approval. ""Maintaining regulatory compliance is very difficult, as the US FDA can even pin-point minuscule lapses to issue an observation, a major reason why one facility of the same company may be stuck in regulatory hurdles while the other may not,"" he said.

Any small issue at the said plant on the day of inspection can result in receiving an observation, while the process of making the changes and adhering to those lapses in order to receive a final get-go takes some time. In such a case, it would be worth firing from two cylinders rather than pegging all hopes on one to maximise the chances of receiving approval.

Another factor highlighted by Manchanda was the inevitable delays in the process. He stated that companies can only apply for a site transfer or addition once the drug and its manufacturing process have been cleared by the US FDA. Even in that case, some delays on account of site inspections for both the sites where the particular drug was being filed were inevitable.

However, as Randeria pointed out, companies might soon come to realise that aside from the initial delay because of approvals, dual filing presents a much safer and more sustainable path towards hassle-free drug launches.

Why the time is now?

It has only been recently that the US FDA began tightening the screws of regulatory practices in its inspections, which resulted in major manufacturing facilities falling prey to mishaps. Much of the regulatory pressure faced by domestic pharma companies has been evident after physical checks began in full swing post the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, it is only now that these drug makers have started looking for ways to surpass the hurdles with all seriousness.

It was correctly pointed out by Manchanda that urgency is the need of the hour, as these drug delays are leading to loss of revenue, especially at a time when the US market is in a rough patch.

Summing it up, Mitesh Shah said, whether or not most pharma companies will jump onto the bandwagon of dual filing, only time will tell. However, it is definitely a step in the right direction.

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

As Mankind Pharma gears up to go public, its 544-page draft IPO paper throws up an interesting name, Dabur India.

One wonders why would a century-old fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) major be counted as a pharma company’s peer? While Dabur is known for its hair care products, Mankind is famed for its Manforce condoms. Chalk and cheese, to say the least.

But a closer look at the details suggests that there might be more to this than meets the eye.

First, what does the DRHP say?

In the ‘listed industry peers’ section of its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), Mankind Pharma has positioned Dabur India at the 11th spot, above Procter & Gamble Health and Zydus Wellness. Sun Pharma, Cipla, Zydus Lifesciences and Torrent Pharma take the first four spots.

In FY22, Mankind Pharma’s revenue from operations and EPS (earnings per share) came in at Rs 7,781 crore and Rs 35.7, respectively. Meanwhile, Dabur India’s topline stood at Rs 10,888 crore and EPS at Rs 9.8. The DRHP does not list Mankind’s valuation as the price band has not been announced yet.

Also Read: Chrys Capital-backed Mankind Pharma may float Rs 4,200-4,700 crore IPO in April

Return on net worth (RoNW) for Mankind stood at 23.29 percent in FY22, while the same metric for Dabur was 20.75 percent.

The similarities

As one of its main objectives in the DRHP, the company has mentioned “manufacturing, development and sale… of Ayurvedic and Unani medicines by extraction of plant products.” Though this takes the last spot under ‘main objectives’, it is directly comparable to Dabur’s mainstay Ayurvedic identity.

Mankind Pharma’s Gas-O-Fast is an Ayurvedic oral antacid powder, used to relieve symptoms of acidity, heartburn, and indigestion. In FY22, this product clocked sales of Rs 112 crore, which contributed 1.4 percent to the topline. The company also has Health OK, which is a multivitamin tablet and AcneStar, which is a skincare cream.

If one draws parallels to Dabur India, then Pudin Hara and Activ Antacid in digestives, Shilajit Gold in multivitamins and Gulabari brand in skincare go head-to-head with Mankind Pharma’s earlier mentioned products.

Moreover, both companies have a similar urban-rural split. Sales from class II-IV cities and rural areas contributed 47 percent to Mankind Pharma’s domestic sales in FY22. Dabur also derives 47 percent of sales from rural markets.

The differences

That said, the companies cannot be compared on an ‘apples-to-apples basis’, believes Siddharth Oberoi, founder and chief investing officer at Prudent Equity.

“Since Mankind derives the majority of its revenues from therapeutic sectors while Dabur derives all of its revenues from FMCG products, the two businesses cannot be compared,” he said.

Anubhuti Mishra, equity research analyst, Swastika Investmart, said, “Healthcare contributes approximately 35 percent to Dabur India’s revenue while Mankind's consumer healthcare segment makes for only 9 percent of its topline.”

This includes Mankind’s Manforce condoms, which command a 30.2 percent market share. Manforce with Rs 451 crore worth of sales and Prega News with Rs 153 crore in sales make for the biggest contribution to the company’s consumer healthcare segment.

But Oberoi pointed out that the pharma company might get aggressive in the D2C Ayurveda segment in the coming months. “It has acquired a majority stake in health and wellness brand Upakarma Ayurveda to expand its product portfolio,” he said. Upakarma has its own range of Shilajit resin, beauty products and immunity boosters.

So, the future might be anyone’s game. As of now, one thing is clear, investors won’t like it if Mankind Pharma demands a valuation anywhere close to Dabur India’s 55x P/E, with which it has little in common.

Brokerage firm Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities believes the risk-reward ratio for pharmaceutical companies in its coverage has turned favourable, largely due to the deep discounts in their valuations, along with expectations of a margin recovery in the sector.

Despite the challenges faced by the pharma industry in FY22-23, such as slowdown in growth, price erosion, and increased FDA scrutiny following Covid, Nirmal Bang believes the sector is poised for a rebound.

Factors such as rising raw material costs and a higher Covid base were key contributors to the sharp correction experienced by the sector in FY22-23.

On the cusp of a turnaround

With a subdued performance in FY22-23 behind us, Nirmal Bang anticipates a rebound in domestic growth in the pharma sector, with double-digit growth in FY23-24 as the base normalises. Additionally, the brokerage expects price erosion in the US market to cool off from double-digit levels to single-digit levels.

""On the margin front, cost inflation is normalising, and companies have, to a great extent, passed on the burden of additional costs, largely in branded markets,"" the brokerage wrote in its report.

However, the risk of regulatory scrutiny is expected to intensify in the coming financial year and on that account, the brokerage firm prefers companies that are heavy on branded generics and have the least exposure to US generics.

As for companies with higher exposure to the US market, Nirmal Bang sees sustained pressure on valuations.

Margins will improve

Pharmaceutical companies are likely to experience a recovery in margins, thanks to the easing of raw material cost inflation and a reduction in price erosion in the US market.

The price increases implemented by most companies to counter the effects of cost inflation, particularly in branded markets, are also expected to bolster margins in FY23-24, according to Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.

Furthermore, Nirmal Bang forecasts continued growth in the US market in FY23-24, driven by Revlimid's increased market share compared to FY22-23. The launch of key products like Spiriva, Advair, and Transdermals are also expected to support growth further.

Compelling valuations

The brokerage firm has a ""buy"" call for 10 of the 17 pharma companies in its coverage universe, as the recent correction in the sector has made valuations attractive. The company had a ""sell"" recommendation for only one company.

In the large-cap space, Nirmal Bang chose Sun Pharma, Torrent Pharma, and Cipla as its top picks, while Eris Lifesciences, JB Chemicals, and Ajanta Pharma were the preferred bets within the small and mid-cap space."

At 12:11am, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries was quoting at Rs 960.35, up Rs 6.15, or 0.64 percent, on the BSE. It touched an intraday high of Rs 961.00 and an intraday low of Rs 950.80. The scrip was trading with volumes of 114,225 shares, compared to its five day average of 34,822 shares, an increase of 228.02 percent.

Global research and broking firm Jefferies maintained its 'buy' rating on the stock with target of Rs 1,200 per share, an upside of around 26 percent from current market price.

According to Jefferies, Sun Pharma's acquisition of Concert adds a complementary derma product to the existing specialty portfolio. It feels that strong efficacy against competing drugs and leveraging existing infrastructure should result in peak global sales of $850 million by 2031 translating into pre-tax net present value (NPV) of Rs 64 per share. Incremental R&D spend is unlikely to be a major drag on FY24-25 profitability, the brokerage firm said.

The stock has gained 15 percent in the last nine months.

Strong competitive advantage

Deuruxolitinib Phase-III trials data shows 38-42 percent participants met primary end-point at week 24 using Deuruxolitinib against 30 percent for Olumiant and Ritlecitinib. Deuruxolitinib safety data is in-line with competing products. The product has been awarded a breakthrough therapy designation by the US FDA.

Pre-tax NPV of Rs 64 per share for Deuruxolitinib

Sun’s competitive positioning is expected to be strong. Jefferies expects Sun Pharma to leverage its existing field force to market this product and incremental spend will largely be towards promotion of the product. It forecasts that Deuruxolitinib can achieve sales of around $765 million in the US and EU markets by 2031.

""We estimate R&D spend of $100 million over the next two years for Open Label Extension (OLE) studies and its impact on FY25 EBITDA is around 3 percent which should be offset by the recent approval of gRevlimid in the US,"" the research firm added.

Ongoing litigation with Incyte a key hurdle to overcome

""Incyte and Concert have been involved in a legal battle over patents for Ruxolitinib and Deuruxolitinib. The patents under question are '149 (expires in 2033 as per google patent), '335 (expires in 2026) and '659 (expires in 2037). The litigations on '659 went in favor of Concert whereas Concert's challenge on '335 patent covering Ruxolitinib and its deuterium form was rejected,"" Jefferies said in its report.

""For a smooth launch, we expect Sun Pharma to settle with Incyte by giving a royalty payment till the expiry of the patent (Eli Lilly pays up to 20 percent royalty for its product),"" it added.

Drug major Sun Pharma on Monday said it has completed the acquisition of US-based Concert Pharmaceuticals.

In January, the Mumbai-based company inked a pact to acquire Concert in a USD 576 million deal.

The drug major has successfully completed the acquisition of Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company that is developing deuruxolitinib for the potential treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata, Sun Pharma said in a regulatory filing.

""We are excited to add deuruxolitinib, a late-stage, potential best-in-class treatment for alopecia areata, to our growing global dermatology portfolio and expand our presence in the Boston biotech hub,"" Sun Pharma North America CEO Abhay Gandhi said.

By bringing together Concert's talented team with Sun Pharma's global reach and commercial capabilities, this acquisition is an opportunity to bring deuruxolitinib to market globally and make a meaningful difference to alopecia areata patients around the world, he added.

Some others failed to post a robust performance.

Overall, the combined revenue growth at pharmaceutical companies covered by ShareKhan grew 11.8 percent on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter. Operating profit margins also increased by 31 basis points year-on-year to 23.1 percent, but combined net profit was largely flat. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Pharmaceutical companies covered by the securities firm include Aurobindo Pharma, Cipla, Zydus Lifesciences, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Divi's Laboratories, Ipca Labs, Lupin, Torrent Pharma, Biocon, Granules India, Laurus Labs, Abbott India, Strides Pharma, Caplin Point Laboratories and Gland Pharma.

FDA worries

While most drugmakers saw their Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) margins improve in the quarter, ShareKhan expressed concerns about the increased scrutiny by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), leading to production delays and rising guidance around research and development, coupled with higher marketing costs in the near term, which could act as headwinds against a potentially strong operating performance.

The firm also highlighted the rising risk of increased regulatory scrutiny by the US FDA may also act as an overhang on the sector's valuation.

According to ShareKhan's report, the firm prefers generic formulation companies within the pharmaceutical space due to continued complex and differentiated product launches over the next two years, particularly in the novel and biosimilar space, which can drive revenue growth and profitability over the medium term.Zydus Lifesciences, Sun Pharma, Torrent Pharma, and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories are the firm's top picks within the sector.

On the other hand, the firm maintains a cautious stance when it comes to Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) players such as Divi’s Laboratories, Laurus Labs and Gland Pharma.

Growth in this segment is expected to be subdued due to supply-side constraints, the normalization of COVID-19 product sales, and a slowdown in the CDMO synthesis business, which can be a drag on margins in the short-medium term.

Long-term growth drivers in place

Despite having a near-term neutral stance on the pharma sector, analysts at ShareKhan believe Indian pharmaceutical companies are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they are globally competitive and hold a substantial share in most markets in the long term.

The brokerage noted that key drivers that will boost growth for the industry include long-term opportunities in the US, with increasing demand for specialty/complex generics and injectables, and emerging opportunities in the API space.

The report also stated that the industry is expected to see healthy growth in the Indian market, with high single to double-digit growth projected for FY24.

ShareKhan predicts in-line to marginal outperformance for the pharma index going forward as valuations have become reasonable for large players such as Sun Pharma, Zydus Life, Dr Reddy’s and Torrent Pharma, as well as for niche India-focused players such as Abbott India.​"

On the other hand, the deal with Remidio Innovative Solutions is expected to close sooner, by end of February, for a cash consideration of Rs 149.9 crore. The company had a turnover of Rs 26.6 crore last FY.

Sun Pharma's earlier acquisition was US-based Concert Pharma, to boost its specialty pipeline. Announced in January 2023, the deal worth $576 million gives the company access to Deuruxolitinib, which is being evaluated for treatment for the autoimmune condition alopecia areata, resulting in patchy hair loss.

Recently, it has also bought anti-inflammatory brands Disperzyme, Disperzyme-CD, and Phlogam from Mumbai-based Aksigen Hospital Care.

Drug major Sun Pharma is recalling over 34,000 bottles of a generic medication, used to treat high blood pressure, in the US market due to failed dissolution testing.

As per the US Food and Drug Administration's Enforcement Report, the US-based arm of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries is recalling lots of Diltiazem Hydrochloride extended-release capsules which are used to treat angina, high blood pressure and some types of irregular heartbeats.

Princeton (New Jersey) based Sun Pharmaceutical Inc is recalling the affected lot due to ""Failed Impurity (Deacetyl Diltiazem Hydrochloride) specification during stability testing and failed dissolution testing at FDA laboratory.""

The Mumbai-based drug major had produced the lot at its Halol-based manufacturing facility in Gujarat. The affected lot was later distributed in the market by its US-based unit. The company initiated the Class II nationwide recall (US) on January 13 this year.

The scheme will foster innovation development and increase investment opportunities in the pharma sector, C.S. Muralidharan, Group Chief Financial Officer, told Moneycontrol.

“It's a heartening to see the announcements incentivising research and development and the government encouraging R&D investment. It's a positive step as it will encourage the industry to invest in R&D, but to know more we will have to wait for the fine print and understand what's exactly the implementation and what other contours of the framework are,” Muralidharan said.

When asked about Sun pharma’s own R&D not touching the intended target of revenue set by the firm, Muralidharan said that in the current fiscal year, the company had invested 5.3 percent of consolidated revenue in R&D.

“However, for Q3 we are at 6 percent of revenue. We expect the fourth quarter R&D spend to continue the momentum…it's difficult to pinpoint the exact number for the full year, but our endeavor has been to strengthen our R&D spend,” he added.

Sun Pharmaceutical has posted a 5.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in net profit for the third quarter of Financial Year 2022-23 to Rs 2,166 crore, riding on sales in India and the US and an uptick in the global specialty drugs portfolio.

“This consolidated revenue growth was contributed by strong performance from the global specialty business, India and emerging markets,” Muralidharan said.

Commenting on future strategies, Muralidharan said Sun Pharma had a very clear strategic intent to invest in its specialty business in the core therapeutic areas.

“We really want to invest in the space of the core areas of dermatology, ophthalmology and build a portfolio in US and other global markets and gain momentum,” he added.

Working with US FDA on Halol Facility

Commenting on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) action against its facility in Halol, Gujarat, the Group CFO said the company was working on the remediation process. He didn’t share a specific timeline as to when the manufacturing facility in Halol will be functional.

The US drug regulator has issued a warning letter to Sun Pharma for manufacturing lapses, including failure to comply with written procedures to prevent microbiological contamination of drugs manufactured at the plant.

“At this point of time, we are not able to give a specific timeline as to when the site will come back. However, we are working internally and with regulators to bring the site as quickly as possible to the compliant status,” he added.

In the warning letter, the FDA had highlighted a series of lapses at Sun Pharma’s Gujarat plant, which has been put on an import alert list by the US drug regulator.

The FDA inspected Sun Pharma’s Halol plant from April 26 to May 9, 2022.

On an earnings call with investors, Sun Pharma said there will be a certain amount of consulting and remediation costs associated with the bringing of Halol facility back to compliance status.

“There may also be some new investments which may be required, but that's part of the remediation process,” Muralidharan said, adding the import alert on the Halol facility doesn’t have a major impact on consolidated revenue in the US market.

About 3 percent of consolidated revenue in the US market would be affected by the step after paying the cost of remediation, he added."

Motilal Oswal's research report on Sun Pharma

Sun Pharma (SUNP) delivered in-line 3QFY23 earnings, led by improving traction in specialty sales, better emerging market traction, and currency benefit. Also, the performance was in-line, despite regulatory hurdle at Halol and step-up in other expenses, due to higher selling and distribution spent. We maintain our earnings estimate for FY23/FY24/FY25 and continue to value SUNP at 25x 12M forward earnings to arrive at a price target of INR1,220. We expect 15% earnings CAGR over FY23-25, led by 11%/11%/17% sales CAGR in DF/EM/US, respectively, and 90bp margin expansion. The enhanced focus towards a) strengthening specialty franchise through addition of products in dermatology, and increasing footprint for better reach/promotional activities, b) outperforming industry in branded generics markets and c) building niche ANDA pipeline provides good visibility for sustainable earnings growth going forward. We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock.



Outlook

We maintain our earnings estimate for FY23/FY24/FY25 and continue to value SUNP at 25x 12M forward earnings to arrive at a price target of INR1,220. We expect 15% earnings CAGR over FY23-25, led by 11%/11%/17% sales CAGR in DF/EM/US, respectively, and 90bp margin expansion.

Deuroxolitnib has shown a better Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score compared to peers, providing confidence on the potential of the product post regulatory approval. The deal further enhances specialty offerings by SUNP in the dermatology space. The development potential of Concert synergizes with marketing capabilities of SUNP, thereby aiding significant value accretion on the combined basis.

Concert stockholders will also receive a non-tradeable contingent value right (CVR) entitling holders to receive up to an additional USD 3.50 per share of common stock in cash, payable upon deuruxolitinib achieving certain net sales milestones within specified periods, it added.

Concert is a late-stage biotechnology company pioneering the use of deuterium in medicinal chemistry.

Concert has an extensive patent portfolio, including its lead product candidate deuruxolitinib, an oral inhibitor of Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2 for the treatment of Alopecia Areata, an autoimmune dermatological disease, which is in late-stage development.

Alopecia Areata is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks hair follicles, resulting in partial or complete loss of hair on the scalp and body.

""There is a significant unmet need in the Alopecia Areata space and we aim to build on Concert's commitment to supporting the Alopecia Areata patient community. We are well-positioned to successfully bring this product to market globally,"" Sun Pharma North America CEO Abhay Gandhi stated.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Sun Pharma will promptly commence a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Concert common stock.

Concert stockholders will be offered an upfront payment of USD 8 per share of common stock in cash.

Concert's Board of Directors has unanimously recommended that Concert stockholders tender their shares in the tender offer.

The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2023. ""Our mission at Concert has always been to translate innovative science to clinical solutions in order to meaningfully improve patients' lives. We are proud to see our team's accomplishment creating a valuable new drug candidate for a major, underserved disease appropriately recognized and valued by Sun Pharma as a means to expand their ongoing, international commitment to dermatology,"" Concert President and CEO Roger Tung stated.

For the nine-month period ending September 2022, Concert reported total revenue of USD 29,000 and a net loss of USD 90.6 million.

The R&D expense for that nine-month period was USD 75.7 million. As of September 30, 2022, it had around USD 148.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments.

Sun Pharma had net cash of USD 1.6 billion as of September 30, 2022."

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has slammed Sun Pharma, the country’s largest generic drug maker, for manufacturing violations such as failure to investigate discrepancies in batches of products, not cleaning equipment used in drug manufacturing and failing to prevent contamination at its Halol facility in Gujarat.

In a warning letter, the FDA has highlighted a series of lapses at Sun Pharma’s Gujarat plant, which has been put on an import alert list by the US drug regulator.

In the letter dated December 15, the FDA told Dilip Shanghvi, Managing Director, Sun Pharma, that it had observed significant violations of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals at the Halol facility. “Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated,” the warning letter said.

The FDA inspected Sun Pharma’s Halol plant from April 26 to May 9, 2022.

The company gave a detailed response to the US regulator on May 31 in response to Form 483. However, the FDA was not convinced and placed the Halol facility on import alert on December 7. In its letter, the US FDA pointed out that Sun Pharma failed to thoroughly investigate discrepancies in batches of products at the Halol facility.

‘Putting patients at risk’

The regulator said that in November 2021, despite experiencing significant media fill failure, resulting in serious flaws and risks, Sun Pharma failed to perform a timely risk assessment to evaluate if the quality and sterility of its distributed drug products were affected by these deficiencies.

“You waited over five months to initiate a recall of the affected batches. The failure to proactively identify deficiencies and implement timely and sustainable corrective actions and preventive actions (CAPA) is unacceptable because it puts patients at risk,” the warning letter said.

The FDA has further pointed out that Sun Pharma did not follow appropriate procedures to prevent contamination at the Halol facility. “Operators’ bodies and hands were in immediate proximity to the sterile active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) during dispensing, compounding, and syringe-loading in the filling station,” the letter said.

The warning letter also said that the pharma giant had failed to establish an adequate system to monitor environmental conditions. “Vigilant and responsive environmental and personnel monitoring programs should be designed to provide meaningful information on the state of control of your aseptic processing environment,” it said.

According to the warning letter, Sun Pharma had acknowledged the inadequacies of the environmental and personnel monitoring programme, stating that the drug products impacted by the observation are being recalled, and that the specific filling line involved in the observation was no longer in use. “You fail to adequately explain how your quality and operations management will ensure appropriate cleanroom design, control, aseptic practices, and cleanroom behaviour during production,” the letter said.

Failure to investigate discrepancies

The US FDA’s warning letter said that Sun Pharma had failed to use suitable equipment in manufacturing drug products.

“It is your responsibility to ensure that only appropriately designed and maintained equipment are used in the manufacture of your drug products,” the drug regulator said. It further stated: “Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate any unexplained discrepancy or failure of a batch or any of its components to meet any of its specifications, whether or not the batch has already been distributed.”

Sun Pharma has been asked to provide a comprehensive, independent assessment of its overall system for investigation of discrepancies and to provide an action plan detailing how it will fix this system.

Drug contamination concerns

The warning letter from the US FDA also points out that Sun Pharma failed to sterilise equipment and utensils at appropriate intervals to prevent malfunctions or contamination that would alter the purity of a drug. The company has been asked to provide a comprehensive, independent retrospective assessment of cleaning effectiveness to evaluate the scope of cross-contamination hazards.

Sun Pharma has been told that basis the findings at the Halol facility, the firm does not have an effective quality system in accordance with CGMP.

Company told to take corrective action immediately

The company has been asked to immediately carry out a comprehensive assessment of its global manufacturing operations to ensure that its systems, processes, and manufactured products conform to FDA requirements.

“Based upon the nature of the violations we identified at your firm, we strongly recommend engaging a consultant qualified to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements,” the FDA said.

The regulator, however, says that engaging a consultant does not relieve the firm of its obligation to comply with CGMP. “Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance,” the FDA said.

The FDA has given Sun Pharma 15 working days to respond to the warning letter, address violations and prevent their recurrence."

Gland Pharmaceuticals, Cipla and Sun Pharma are the top picks from the pharma pack of stocks for Sanford Bernstein, said Director Nithya Balasubramanian in an exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18.

''Sun Pharma is moving away from the pack given their exposure to US specialty which seems to be doing well and Cipla is moving because of their complex generic pipeline in the US, where we see material opportunities to play out in the next few years,'' Balasubramanian told CNBC-TV18.

''Gland Pharma has corrected quite a bit. We think the market is unwilling to appreciate the resilience in the company's business model. Their B2B business affords a few luxuries such as slightly lesser price erosion and the ability to grow the base.'' she added.

However, according to Balasubramanian, it is still very soon to decipher that the re-surfacing COVID-19 concerns are an opportunity for pharma stocks.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

''China is a very different economy and their vaccination coverage is lower, while infection rate is higher than India's. So as of now, it presents little opportunity to our generic players,'' said Balasubramanian.

Pharma, Covid-related stocks in focus

Ever since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, pharma and diagnostic stocks have been in focus for market players. Covid-19 related stocks include Wockhardt - which established a contract with the UK government for supplies of AstraZeneca's COVID vaccine.

The vaccine-related stocks that continue to be in focus include Dr Reddy's, Zydus Life, Biocon. Pfizer was also in focus on hopes of their vaccines coming to India. Cipla and Zydus Life had one of the largest portfolio of COVID-19-related drugs in India at the height of the pandemic.

COVID-19 drug-related stocks include Gland Pharma and Alembic. Alembic was one of the largest manufacturers of the antibiotic Azithromycin -which had seen a huge volume spurt during the first and second waves of COVID in India. Lastly, the diagnostic stocks include Dr Lal Pathlabs, Thyrocare, Metropolis Health which have been in focus.

This year, many of these stocks saw a slowdown in projects related to COVID. Wockhardt's UK revenue fell considerably from Rs 794 crore in H1FY22 to Rs 422 crore in HIFY23.

Cipla's demand for COVID-19 drugs was negligible in Q2FY23, while Gland Pharma's sales were impacted in Q2 as it went down 3 percent due to absence of COVID-related drugs during the July-September quarter. Diagnostic stocks also fell between 80-97% on a YoY basis in Q2.

What experts say

Experts reckon that India is much more resilient this time, as the county now has a hybrid immunity and a large amount of adult population has been fully vaccinated. Hybrid immunity is a combination of natural immunity due to exposure and vaccination.

Increasing market competitiveness, regulatory scrutiny, and domestic price regulations will shape the growth of the generics and injectables market in India, according to Gland Pharma MD & CEO Srinivas Sadu.

Rating agency ICRA's Assistant Vice President & Sector Head Corporate Sector Ratings Mythri Macherla said the domestic pharmaceutical companies are expected to report steady revenue growth of 6-8 per cent in FY2023 and in FY2024.

The revenue increase in FY23 will be supported by healthy growth in the domestic and emerging markets, while pricing pressures in the US and European markets will moderate the growth to a certain extent, she added."

Days after Sun Pharma’s Halol plant was listed on import alert by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the company said it has received a warning letter from regulator summarizing violations at the manufacturing plant in Gujarat.

“We now wish to inform you that the Company has received Warning Letter from USFDA for the Halol facility. The Warning Letter summarizes violations with respect to Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. USFDA shall make public the contents of the Warning Letter in due course,” the pharma company said in an exchange filing.

The USFDA last week listed the Halol facility in Gujarat under import alert, with products manufactured at the unit now subject to refusal of admission in the US market.

The decision from the FDA was after an inspection of the facility by the USFDA from April 26 to May 9, 2022.

The Import Alert implies inter alia, that all future shipments of products manufactured at this facility are subject to refusal of admission to the US market until the facility becomes compliant with cGMP standards, Sun Pharma said in statement last week.

Sun Pharma has said that the supplies to the US market from the Halol facility accounted for approximately three percent of firm’s consolidated revenues.

“The Company continues to cooperate with the USFDA and will undertake all necessary steps to resolve these issues and to ensure that the regulator is completely satisfied with the Company’s remedial action,” it added.

The USFDA has excluded 14 products from this import alert subject to certain conditions."

Import alert for drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical's Halol plant in Gujarat by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) could lead to loss of sales, according to brokerage firms Nomura and Credit Suisse.

Japanese brokerage firm Nomura views the escalation to import alert as a ‘negative surprise’ as it will lead to loss of sales, besides delaying new product approvals. It estimates the overall loss of sales will likely be around $100 million in the near term.

Zurich-headquartered brokerage firm Credit Suisse estimates that the import alert would immediately cease Sun Pharma’s annualised sales of $100 million in the US.

USFDA has exempted 14 drugs, which contribute a further $50 million in sales, to avoid the risk of shortages in the market.

However, Credit Suisse estimates the impact to be long term. “The impact is likely over the longer term as the company needs to revamp its entire aseptic manufacturing and quality control processes to address the deficiencies pointed out by the USFDA across production, laboratory control and quality units. There is a strong likelihood that the facility's resolution could take multiple years,” it added.

Sun Pharma’s Halol unit under the USFDA scanner

US FDA has issued an import alert on the Halol manufacturing facility. The US FDA inspected Sun Pharma's manufacturing facility in Halol from April 26, 2022, to May 9, 2022, and concluded with 10 observations. The agency subsequently classified the facility as Official Action Indicated (OAI) in August 2022, which bars any new product approvals.

Official Action Indicated means objectionable conditions were found and regulatory action is recommended.

Sun Pharma disclosed that supplies to the US from the Halol facility contributed to 3% of consolidated revenues in FY22, which translates into $150-160 million in sales, or approximately 30% of US (ex-Taro) generic sales.

Brokerage calls

In the recent past, Sun Pharma’s Mohali formulation facility was also classified as OAI.

Typically, the escalation to an import alert is rare, according to Nomura. It adds, therefore, besides the earnings impact from the regulatory actions thus far, investors may be concerned about the regulatory outcome at other sites which are due for inspection. Assuming an annual sales impact of $100-150 million, Nomura expects approximately 4-7% impact on the company’s FY24F EPS (earnings per share)

Nomura has assigned a buy call to Sun Pharma and has maintained a target of Rs 1094. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse has given a neutral rating and has raised the target from Rs 880 to Rs 1000.

No revision in revenue guidance for the current fiscal year: Sun Pharma

Clarifying the effect on the revenue and the revision of future guidance of the company, Sun Pharma stated that US supplies from Halol contributed approximately 3 percent of consolidated revenues for the year ended March 31, 2022, including sales from exempted products. ""We are not revising our revenue guidance for the current financial year,"" it said. It also added that there will be no impact on the specialty revenues either.

Sun Pharma also said there would be no impact on sales of Sun Pharma's speciality portfolio after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) imposed an import alert.

Shares of Sun Pharma opened flat in early trade on Friday and are currently trading in the green after falling for five consecutive sessions."

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd on December 8 clarified further on US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) listing its Halol plant on import alert earlier today.

In a regulatory filing, Sun Pharma answered some questions on the development, especially with regard to its overall revenue.

Earlier today, the US FDA had listed the Halol facility in Gujarat under import alert with products manufactured at the unit now subject to refusal of admission in the US market. The development followed an inspection of the facility by the USFDA from April 26 to May 9, 2022.

Clarifying the effect on the revenue and the revision of future guidance of the company, Sun Pharma stated that US supplies from Halol contributed approximately 3 percent of consolidated revenues for the year ended March 31, 2022, including sales from exempted products. ""We are not revising our revenue guidance for the current financial year,"" it said. It also added that there will be no impact on the specialty revenues either.

With the Halol facility under the scanner, the pharma company said that the backup facilities for key products manufactured in the plant will be ""on a case-to-case basis.""

""Site transfer of all products manufactured at Halol would be a complex and time-consuming process, considering that other manufacturing facilities may not have similar infrastructure. Hence, we would evaluate product transfers on a case-to-case basis,"" Sun Pharma said.

Further, answering the conditions required by the USFDA for the supply of 14 exempted products from the said facility, Sun Pharma said that the conditions for the supplies of 14 exempted products are ""confidential,"" adding, ""We are assessing the incremental costs to meet conditions for the supply of these products. However, we believe that the same will not be material.""

On the impact of the import alert on revenues next year, the company clarified that its revenue guidance for next year, as and when shared, shall incorporate the same. It also stated that it had no information currently, whether the supplies to other markets get impacted due to the import alert.

Moreover, on how much time will the company require to get the Halol facility back into full compliance, Sun Pharma said, ""We are working with the USFDA and will undertake all necessary steps to resolve these issues. At this point in time, we are unable to provide a timeline for resolution.""

As per information available on BSE, Sun Pharma had clocked revenue of Rs 15,585.98 crore in 2021-22.

Sun Pharma had earlier today said it ''continues to cooperate with the USFDA and will undertake all necessary steps to resolve these issues and to ensure that the regulator is completely satisfied with the company's remedial action''.

The Nifty50 reclaimed its record high of 18,604 at last after more than 13 months, continuing an uptrend for the fifth straight session on November 28 and maintained higher highs for the fourth session in a row.

There was also a breakout of long, slightly downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining October 19, 2021 and November 25, 2022. On a weekly basis, it has consistently maintained higher high formation for seventh consecutive week.

The momentum is in favour of bulls but having consistent run-up for the last few days, there could be some bouts of volatility and consolidation can be seen in coming sessions, before taking gradual march towards 18,700-19,000, with immediate support at 18,500 and crucial support at 18,300-18,000 levels, experts said.

""We expect the Nifty to gradually march towards 19,000 mark, as the overall trend remains positive. Participation of the broader market further adds strength to the market,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said.

However, intermittent volatility cannot be ruled out on account of global worries, he feels.

The Nifty has shown real resilience and has outperformed by a big margin point to point. This has given a rise in probability that the index may touch the extrapolated levels of 19,600 (2,800 points mirror from the recent bottom at 16,800), Pushkaraj Kanitkar, VP Equities at GEPL Capital, said. ""The view would be negated only below the level of 17,800.""

Here are top 10 stock ideas by experts that can participate in the Nifty's journey towards the 19,000 mark:

Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi

PVR: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,867 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,795 | Target: Rs 2,000 | Return: 7 percent

Since the last 3 trading sessions, the counter has witnessed nice buying interest along with volume picking up complementing the up move. At the current juncture, PVR has taken support at 200 DEMA (days exponential moving average) high low band along with pair of Doji candlesticks structure.

Recently PVR has taken out its previous swing high of Rs 1,858 and has closed near the Rs 1,867 mark in its previous trading session.

On the indicator front, price ROC (rate of change) 21 days is well placed above the zero line around 8 levels along with daily MACD (moving average convergence and divergence) giving a bullish cross exactly above the zero line thus hinting towards Rs 2,000 levels in a month's time.

Plausible support is expected around Rs 1,795. One can buy in small tranches between Rs 1,860-1,870 and another at Rs 1,830 levels (if tested again).

Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail: Buy | LTP: Rs 312 | Stop-Loss: Rs 290 | Target: Rs 340 | Return: 9 percent

The fall which started from November 1, 2022 till November 18, 2022 resulted in a 17 percent cut in price from the high of Rs 360. At the current juncture, the said counter is taking support near Rs 300 levels.

On an hourly scale, it has given a bullish crossover in the directional movement index along with an hourly MACD bullish cross thus confirming an upside in the counter. One can buy with an upside target of Rs 340 with a stop-loss of Rs 290.

Tinplate Company of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 312 | Stop-Loss: Rs 290 | Target: Rs 350 | Return: 12 percent

Tinplate has corrected almost 34 percent from its top of Rs 438 which was registered on April 13, 2022. On a weekly scale, it has taken support near its previous historical support zone Rs 290-300.

In the last 4 months, it has made a nice base near Rs 300 levels. Recently on a daily scale, the stock confirmed a bullish Hammer candlestick pattern exactly at 200 DEMA high low band and that is adding more confirmation of further upside in the counter.

In addition to the above-discussed technical reasoning, weekly RSI (relative strength index) has nicely bounced back from Rs 40 levels which is adding more strength to the said counter. Thus we advise traders to buy the stock for an upside target of Rs 350 with a stop-loss of Rs 290.

Expert: Kunal Shah, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities

Reliance Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,707.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,600 | Target: Rs 2,800-2,920 | Return: 8 percent

The stock bounced back sharply from its 200 EMA which is placed at Rs 2,500 level.

Nippon Life India: Buy | LTP: Rs 269.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 260 | Target: Rs 285-290 | Return: 7.5 percent

The stock for the past couple of months had witnessed a sharp correction with lower high lower low formations. The stock is now witnessing a bottom formation on the daily chart with a sharp surge in volumes.

The stock is trading in a strong uptrend with higher top and higher bottom formations on all the time frames. The momentum indicator RSI has entered the zone of 60 which confirms the strength of the stock.

The stock is trading well above its short-term moving average which will act as support. The lower-end support zone Rs 1,980-1,950 will act as a cushion for the bulls and the upside visible targets are Rs 2,200-2,240.

Sun Pharma: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,034.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 925 | Target: Rs 1,200 | Return: 16 percent

Although belonging to the laggard sector (pharma and healthcare), Sun Pharma has remained a consistent performer right from the March 2020 lows. Rising in a rational uptrend, the stock is in striking distance of all-time highs created in 2015 around the level of Rs 1,200.

The momentum in the stock seems pretty strong and hence we have seen strong outperformance with respect to the peers in the sector (Sun Pharma has moved up contrary to downmove in Nifty PHARMA Index.).

Immediate targets are placed at Rs 1,200 while negation of the view would happen below the level of Rs 925 (25-week DMA).

State Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 608.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 540 | Target: Rs 820 | Return: 35 percent

The stock belongs not just to the outperforming sector (Bank Nifty has created all-time highs way before the Nifty), but intrinsically has been outperformer within the sector (both private & PSU banks).

The prices created fresh highs although the heavyweights within the index like HDFC Bank (private) or Bank of Baroda, or Canara Bank (PSU banks) are still off the all-time highs.

The outperformance will open up price projection of patterns to around Rs 820, while the view will get negated below Rs 540, which was the level of earlier highs with multiple touch points.

Larsen & Toubro: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,064.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,800 | Target: Rs 2,350 | Return: 14 percent

In sync with the price movement since October 2021, we have seen L&T too touch new highs recently. In the process it has remained a strong contender for the leadership within the Nifty50.

Technically it has formed a continuation pattern in the form of Cup & Handle pattern. The price projection for the pattern points to levels of Rs 2350, which also happens to be the extrapolation from the recent swing low of Rs 1,800.

We stand bullish on the same with negation only below the swing low.

Drug major Sun Pharma on Wednesday said it has inked a licensing agreement with Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company to commercialise a medication for the treatment of neonatal seizures in the US market.

The Mumbai-based drug maker has inked a pact with Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company (SPARC) to commercialise benzyl alcohol and propylene glycol-free phenobarbital sodium powder for injection in the US.

SPARC submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for the said product in February 2022.

Currently, there are no phenobarbital injection products approved by the US FDA for the treatment of seizures in newborns.

Under the terms of the license agreement, Sun Pharma will pay SPARC an upfront payment of USD 10 million, the drug major said in a statement.

SPARC will also be eligible to receive milestone payments contingent upon the achievement of regulatory and sales milestones, as well as tiered royalties on sales, it added.

""Through our existing relationships with hospitals and other institutional customers, we are well-positioned to bring this product to market and make a difference in the lives of patients,"" Sun Pharma North America CEO Abhay Gandhi said.

SPARC CEO Anil Raghavan said the medication is designed to minimise the risk of neonatal gasping syndrome, a life-threatening condition, which can be observed with the use of benzyl alcohol containing drug formulations.

SPARC was formed in 2007 through a demerger from Sun Pharma."

Motilal Oswal's research report on Sun Pharma

SUNP delivered a better than expected 2QFY23 earnings, led by superior execution in the Specialty portfolio, US Generics (excluding Taro), and the Domestic Formulation (DF) segment; benefits from the PLI scheme; and a favorable currency movement. As a percentage of sales, R&D spends remain low at 5.3% v/s the management’s guidance of 6-8% for FY23, further boosting profitability in 2Q. We have raised our FY23/FY24 EPS estimate by 7%/5% to factor in: a) enhanced traction in the Specialty portfolio, b) industry outperformance in Branded Generics of the DF segment and in emerging markets, c) reduced R&D spends, and d) better operating leverage.

Outlook

We continue to value SUNP at 25x 12M forward earnings to arrive at our TP of INR1,240. We remain positive on the stock on the back of an increased prescription base for the Specialty portfolio, robust franchise building in Branded Generics, niche ANDA pipeline awaiting approval, and controlled cost. We reiterate our Buy rating.

Zydus Lifesciences shares reached an eight-month high after a series of US regulatory approvals for its drugs. The stock hit Rs 426 on the National Stock Exchange on October 7, a level last seen on January 17.

Since August 31, the company has received final and temporary approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration for eight of its abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs). It now has 326 approvals from 428 ANDAs filed since June 30, 2022.

The stock gained 10 percent over the past five sessions after getting four US FDA approvals in a week. Over the past month, it has advanced 12 percent, outperforming Cipla, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries. However, the Zydus Lifesciences stock has still lost 11 percent in 2022.

Key approvals

The US accounts for 40 percent of the company’s revenue, which is why each FDA approval is positive. Here are some of the recent approvals:

September 12: Final approval and 180-day shared exclusivity for Cariprazine capsules. It has annual sales of $2.39 billion in the US and is used in the treatment of schizophrenia.

September 13: Final approval to market Lenalidomide capsules, used to treat various types of cancers. It had annual sales of $2.86 billion in the US.

September 16: Tentative approval for Sugammadex injection. It had annual sales of $772 million in the US. It is used for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade in adults undergoing surgery.

October 3: Final approval and 180-day shared exclusivity for Mirabegron extended-release tablets, used to treat overactive bladders. It has annual sales of $2.42 billion in the US.

October 6: Final approval and 180-day shared exclusivity for Brivaracetam tablets, which have annual sales of $412 million in the US and is used to treat partial-onset seizures in children aged 4 and above.

Game changers

Investors are currently bullish on the opportunity emerging from Revlimid, a generic version of a cancer drug. Revlimid is the brand/trade name for Lenalidomide, which Zydus launched on September 20, a week after getting final approval.

The drug works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells.

“This underscores our mission to offer quality healthcare solutions that impact lives as we continue to explore opportunities to grow our US business,” said Sharvil Patel, managing director of Zydus Lifesciences.

According to Param Desai, a research analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, “Cipla, Zydus, and Dr Reddy’s have all launched their generic Revlimid product in September, and for Q2 of FY23 earnings estimate, we have factored in $25-40 million of sales from this across companies. We see sequential growth of 10 percent in US sales for Zydus.”

Aarti Rao, a research analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, said she sees significant opportunity in the Mirabegron approval.

“One of the most meaningful approvals is for generic Myrbetriq (a brand name for Mirabegron), where Zydus has 180-day shared exclusivity (with Lupin). This can be a big opportunity for the next two quarters until new entrants kick in,” according to Rao.

Risks

Desai said the management’s commentary on the domestic market and the competitive scenario in key products are crucial for the stock. Moreover, pricing pressure and regulatory scrutiny in the US generics market still persists.

The other factor is the company’s Moraiya unit, which Zydus said in a regulatory filing dated August 5 received four observations from the US FDA and will be addressed “within the stipulated timeline.”

Rao said any escalation of the Moraiya plant warning will be a key risk for the company. The unit has been under the FDA scanner since 2019.

Anand Rathi has a ‘hold’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 440, while Prabhudas Lilladher has a ‘buy’ rating with a target of Rs 425.

Leading generic drug makers Glenmark, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's and Jubilant Cadista are recalling multiple products in the US market, the world's largest market for medicines, for various issues.

As per the latest Enforcement Report by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), Mumbai-based drug firm Glenmark is recalling over 6.5 lakh tubes of a generic skin treatment ointment due to manufacturing issues.

New Jersey-based Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc, a subsidiary of the company, is recalling affected lot of Tacrolimus Ointment, which is used to treat eczema, due to ""Defective Container"", it added. The company initiated the nationwide Class III recall on July 11 this year.

The affected lot has been manufactured in India and distributed in the US by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc, the report stated. As per the USFDA, a Class III recall is initiated in a ""situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.""

As per the USFDA, Sun Pharma is recalling 9,552 bottles of epilepsy treatment drug Divalproex Sodium delayed-release tablets due to ""Failed Dissolution Specifications"". The affected lot has been produced at the company's Halol plant in Gujarat and distributed in the US by Cranbury-based Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc.

The drug initiated the Class II recall in the US on June 27 this year. Similarly, the US-based arm of Dr Reddy's Laboratories is recalling 5,531 cartons of Lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets in two strengths due to failed dissolution specifications.

The New Jersey-based firm initiated the Class 11 nationwide recall on July 13. Besides, Jubilant Cadista Pharmaceuticals is recalling 38,160 bottles of Irbesartan Tablets (150 and 75 mg), used to treat high blood pressure.

The affected lot has been produced at Jubilant Generics' Roorkee plant, USFDA said. The Salisbury-based drug firm initiated the Class II recall on July 18.

As per the US health regulator, a class II recall is initiated in a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote. The US generic drug market was estimated to be around USD 115.2 billion in 2019. It is by far the largest market for pharmaceutical products in the world.

In the last financial year, India's pharma exports stood at around USD 24.62 billion with the US, the UK, South Africa, Russia, and Nigeria emerging as the top five destinations."

SUNP delivered a strong beat on 1QFY23 earnings, led by broad based growth across business segments (US/Domestic Formulation (DF)/emerging markets (EMs)/RoW). While lower R&D spends has further enhanced margin in 1QFY23. However, the postponement of clinical trials would delay in obtaining potential approvals/subsequent commercial benefit from new chemical entity (NCE) assets. We have raised our FY23/FY24 EPS estimate by 6%/4%, factoring in steady industry outperformance in the Branded Generics segment and lower R&D spends.

Outlook

We continue to value SUNP at 25x 12M forward earnings to arrive at our TP of INR1,100. We remain positive on SUNP on the back of sustained scale-up in the Specialty portfolio, robust franchise building in the Branded Generics portfolio, and healthy ANDA pipeline awaiting approval.

At 12.08 pm, the stock was trading at Rs 914 on the National Stock Exchange, down 3.10 percent.

Global research firm Goldman Sachs has a “sell” rating on the stock with the target at Rs 720 per share. It is of the view that revenue growth partially offsets rising costs, adding that US price erosion would impact both company and Taro’s generic business.

HSBC, on the other hand, has a “buy” call and has raised the target to Rs 1,120 a share, an upside of 22 percent from the current market price.

""Q1 beat was mainly on lower R&D costs with specialty sales traction continuing in Q1. Improved realisations for Winlevi and Halol clearance are the key catalysts,"" it said. Winlevi is a cream used in treating acne, while Halol manufacturing facility is in Gujarat.

Sun Pharma’s India formulation sales in the June quarter at Rs 3,387 crore were up 13 percent on like-to-like basis, excluding Covid products sales during the first quarter of the previous fiscal. On reported basis (including Covid product sales), the growth is 2.4 percent over the year-ago period

Specialty revenue was lower than expected while margin benefitted from low R&D and forex gains. Weakness in Taro and lower specialty sales being offset by India and US (ex-Taro) sales, it said.

The brokerage firm is of the view that Q1 was largely in-line with estimates with expectations of sustained growth in India and specialty on track.

""Taro portfolio continues to experience pricing pressure. Positive view driven by high contribution to earnings from the branded generic business,"" it added.

Life Insurance Corporation of India has offloaded 4.8 crore equity shares or 2% stake in the company via open market transactions during May 17-July 22, 2022. With this, LIC's stake in the company reduced to 5.02%, from 7.02% earlier.

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries on Tuesday said it has expanded the scope of its partnership with Cassiopea regarding a medication to treat acne. It has inked addendums to the licence and supply agreements for WINLEVI (clascoterone) cream 1 percent, expanding the territory to include Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Mexico and Russia.

As per the tie-up, the company will receive from Cassiopea the exclusive right to develop and commercialise WINLEVI in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Mexico and Russia, Sun Pharma said in a statement.

Cosmo will be the exclusive supplier of the product while Cassiopea will receive an upfront payment of USD 7 million, potential regulatory and sales milestones and customary double-digit royalties on net sales, it added.

Last year, Sun Pharma and Cassiopea, a subsidiary of Cosmo Pharmaceuticals, had signed licence and supply agreements for the US and Canada markets. Sun Pharma had then launched WINLEVI in the US market in November 2021. WINLEVI is a new class of topical medication that continues to generate significant interest among dermatologists in the US.

”The expansion of our agreement with Cosmo will enable us to make this new acne treatment available to patients in many more countries and is in line with our strategy to build a global portfolio of specialty products,” Sun Pharma EVP & Head – Generic R&D, Generic Global BD and Emerging Markets Aalok Shanghvi noted.

President of Cosmo Dermatology Division Diana Harbort said Sun Pharma’s early success with WINLEVI in the US makes the company highly confident of their ability to maximise the opportunity in the expanded territory.

A first-in-class topical androgen receptor inhibitor, WINLEVI was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2020 for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age and older. It is suitable for use in both males and females."

As per the latest enforcement report by the US Food and Drug Administration(USFDA), a US-based unit of Sun Pharma is recalling 50,680 vials of Testosterone Cypionate Injection, used to treat low testosterone in adult males, in the American market.

According to the US health regulator, the Mumbai-based drug major is recalling the affected lot due to ''water leakage'' leading to deviation from current good manufacturing practices (cGMP).

The company is also recalling 27 vials of the same medication due to cGMP deviations, USFDA said.

''Manufacturing deviations were reported due to an abnormal appearance on parts of machinery,'' it added. The affected lot was produced at Sun Pharma's Halol (Gujarat) based manufacturing plant.

New Jersey-based Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc, a unit of the company, initiated the Class II nationwide (US) recall of the affected lots last month.

As per the USFDA, a class II recall is initiated in a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.

Mumbai-headquartered Glenmark, on the other hand is recalling 98,307 packs of Mometasone Furoate Topical Solution, a medication used to treat skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, allergies, and rash.

New Jersey-based Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc is recalling the lot, which rolled out from the company's Baddi (Himachal Pradesh) plant, due to ''Defective Container'', the USFDA stated.

The company initiated the nationwide recall, which the US health regulator classified as Class III, on June 16.

A Class III recall is initiated in a ''situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.'' The US generic drug market was estimated to be around USD 115.2 billion in 2019.

It is by far the largest market for pharmaceutical products in the world.

The brokerage expects Sun Pharma growth to be driven by its speciality portfolio and India market from hereon. Earlier, Sun Pharma had forecast a low-single to double-digit FY23 sales growth including an above-industry-level growth for India. Jefferies believes this target is quite achievable as the firm no longer relies on its generic portfolio which has a higher risk of price erosion.

""The next two years' growth will be driven by Ilumya, Cequa, and Winlevi while the dependence on US generics is amongst the lowest in our coverage,"" Jefferies said in its report.

In India, Sun Pharma plans to increase its sales force by 10% which should drive above-industry-level growth for the company, the report added.

Sun Pharma clocked strong growth in speciality segment in FY22 (42%) primarily led by Ilumya sales, thereby overcoming Absorica's decline. Other products that supported growth for the company are Cequa, Levulan, and Odomzo. Sun Pharma launched Winlevi in November 2021, and Jefferies expects it should help to offset the Absorica sales loss in FY23.

""For the next two years, we factor in incremental US sales of $141 million from speciality division (compound annual growth of 12%), and $90 million from the generic portfolio (including Taro), establishing specialty as the bigger growth driver between the two business lines in the US,"" Jefferies added.

Sun Pharma currently is trading at 23.6x versus a five year historical average of one year forward at 24x and slight premium to Nifty Pharma which is trading at 22.2x FY24.

""Our FY23/24 earnings per share (EPS) changes by 4% and 9% on higher revenue and FY24 margin estimates. We are still below FY23/FY24 consensus EPS estimates by 10/9% driven by lower revenue/ margin estimates versus consensus. We value Sun Pharma at 25x FY24 EPS,"" Jefferies said."

Drug major Sun Pharma plans to increase its field force in the domestic market by 10 per cent in the current fiscal in order to drive twin objectives of brand focus and geographical expansion, according to a senior company official. The Mumbai-based drug major, which is the fourth largest specialty generic drug maker in the world, currently employs around 11,000 Medical Representatives (MRs) and related staff in the country.

""The field force expansion done in FY21 has met with good success and considering the current market conditions, we will be undertaking a further expansion of about 10 per cent for our field force in FY23, driven by the twin objectives of brand focus and geographical expansion,"" Sun Pharmaceutical Industries CEO (India Business) Kirti Ganorkar said in an analyst call. The company’s India formulations sales for the full year FY22 stood at Rs 12,759 crore recording a strong 23 per cent growth over 2020-21 fiscal.

For the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2022, formulation revenues in India stood at Rs 3,096 crore, about 16 per cent higher over the January-March quarter of FY21. Replying to a query, Ganorkar termed the intended increase in the field force as ""more like an organic growth"".

""We are expanding to geographies where we had a limited presence or no presence. So, it’s nothing to say that we are looking at competition and then expanding. So, wherever we are seeing growth opportunities in the territories where we are expanding,"" he noted. Besides, the company has a large product portfolio which it needs to ""declutter"", Ganorkar stated.

""That’s why we are expanding in terms of the number of MRs as well as in terms of the number of business units, which are promoting products to the doctors. So, it’s more of our strategy to grow in the future,"" he stated.

Ganorkar said the company has witnessed growth across most of the therapies where it has a presence. ""The growth was driven by a combination of factors like normalised market conditions and improved patient flow to doctor clinics, which led to higher growth in the chronic and semi-chronic segments. New products also contributed to the growth and we are seeing good momentum in products launched in the last 24 months,"" he noted. In the fourth quarter the company introduced 11 new products in the Indian market.

Supported by more than 40 manufacturing facilities, Sun Pharma caters to more than 100 countries across the globe. In FY22, the company’s topline has crossed the $5 billion milestone while the adjusted net profit has gone past the $1 billion mark."

Muralidharan on Tuesday said the company is looking to enhance its brand focus and plans to raise its field force headcount by 10 percent this fiscal.

“The field force expansion from about two years ago has met with success and in order to enhance our brand focus, we are planning on our expansion of 10 percent of field force in the current fiscal which is FY23,” Muralidharan said in an interview to Moneycontrol.

Talking about Sun Pharma’s growth in 2022, Muralidharan said, “I consider FY22 a very good year as the consolidated top line grew by about 15.6 percent. More importantly, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin grew 170 basis points in the period, with a growth of 23.6 percent, and adjusted profit grew 29 percent excluding exceptional items. This robust performance is supported by record double-digit growth across all geographies during the year. For the first time, the company’s top line crossed the $5-billion mark along with adjusted net profit also crossing $1 billion.”

Also read: Explained: How are COVID-19 vaccines destroyed?

The strong performance in FY22, Muralidharan said, was supported by good ramp-up in global specialty sales of products like Ilumya, Cequa and Odomzo, which stood at about $674 million, a growth of 39 percent over the previous year.

Asked if the company has responded to the US Food and Drug Administration’s observation on Sun’s Halol, Gujarat, plant, Muralidharan said, “Towards the completion of the inspection, the US FDA had issued 10 observations. We are filing a response to the US FDA on the corrective action to be undertaken to address these observations within the stipulated time. So at this point of time, we will not be able to disclose any further information on Halol.”

Muralidharan said Sun was making efforts to offset the effect of high inflation and resultant rise in costs through improvement in efficiencies and cost optimisation.

It is not as if the company is focused on India alone, though. Muralidharan said Sun Pharma has invested for growth in China and Japan. “In Japan, we have good business. We launched our specialty product Ilumya, which is performing well there. And we have put building blocks in terms of development business in China and it should gain momentum as we go forward,” he said.

Research is a priority at Sun. “We also focus on our API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) to augment vertical integration,” which will enable the company get its products to the market faster and be better positioned on the price front, he added.

The Sun CFO said the contribution of COVID-related products to the company's top line has been negligible to a large extent.

“From a focus perspective, we have been investing in a specialty pipeline. All our key specialty products are in growth phase and we have enough headroom to further grow and maintain the traction on the growth movement of all our key specialty products and ramp up our global specialty revenues,” he said."

The US health regulator has flagged production-related quality control and procedural lapses, as well as deficient equipment and laboratory standards, at the Gujarat facility of Sun Pharma, India’s largest drugmaker.

The US Food and Drug Administration conducted a good manufacturing inspection of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd's Halol facility from April 26 to May 9, according to the company’s exchange filing.

“We hereby inform you that the US FDA conducted a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) inspection of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited's Halol facility (Gujarat, India) from April 26 to May 9, 2022,” the company said in the filing, a copy of which is with Moneycontrol.

At the conclusion of the inspection, the US FDA issued a Form-483, with 10 observations, the company said, adding that it was preparing a response to the observations, which will be submitted to the US FDA within two weeks of business days.

“The company is committed to addressing these observations promptly. The company remains committed to working closely with the US FDA and continues to enhance its GMP compliance on an ongoing basis,” it said.

A report in BQ Prime listed the ten observations by the US FDA.

“Procedures designed to prevent microbial contamination of drug products did not include adequate validation of aseptic processes. The procedures performed for injectable suspension are a high-risk manually intensive dispensing and compounding process. Deficiencies were identified in the media filling process (that could lead to rejection or recall of batches) and the review videos for the media filling,” one of the observations reported by BQ Prime said.

“Quality unit failed to fulfil responsibilities as per standard operating procedures. It also failed to take timely market action in accordance with drug recall procedure (failure to recall non-confirming batches and recall initiated close to expiry),” another observation said.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the FDA’s observations. A response to related queries is awaited from the US FDA."

Motilal Oswal's research report on Sun Pharma

SUNP’s 3QFY22 performance was operationally better than our estimates, driven by Branded Generics and US (excluding Taro) segments.

We remain positive on SUNP on the back of: a) superior execution in its Specialty portfolio, b) better-than-industry growth in the Branded Generics market of Domestic Formulation (DF) as well as other emerging markets, c) sustained launch momentum in US Generics, and d) delayed R&D spend in the Specialty portfolio.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Sun Pharma

We believe that the recent run-up in Sun Pharma stock due to the good traction for the Winlevi launch is an over-reaction to a typical launch strategy of having a Patient Assistance Program (PAP). A careful analysis of Winlevi prescriptions (Rx) suggests that two-thirds of the Rx come via the PAP. The company is offering a coupon card that limits out-of-pocket (OOP) cost for patients to as low as ~US$25/month. The patient can use the card for as long as 12 months, with total benefits of US$7,231 for 14 tubes. Based on this, we believe the revenue realization for PAP Rx would be very low. PAP is a typical launch strategy used by pharma companies to garner insurance (formulary) coverage. However, literature indicates PAPs rarely drive higher insurance coverage. This is something we have already witnessed with multiple drugs (e.g., Absorica). Hence, we believe total Rx, excluding PAP Rx, is a true reflection of the underlying demand, and we will monitor it to assess Winlevi's potential.

Outlook

For now, we maintain our below-Street expectation for Winlevi peak sales at ~US$60mn, based on: 1) Rx trend, excluding PAP, 2) efficacy profile and 3) competitive landscape. We maintain our Hold rating on Sun with a TP of Rs775.

Leading drug makers Sun Pharma and Lupin are recalling different products in the US, the world’s largest market for medicines, for different reasons.

As per the latest enforcement report by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), Sun Pharma is recalling 22,752 blister packs of Loratadine-D extended-release tablets, used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and the common cold, in the US market.

According to USFDA, the Mumbai-based drug maker is recalling the affected lot due to ""failed moisture limits.""

New Jersey-based Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc, a unit of the company, has initiated the Class III nationwide (US) recall of the 10-count blister packs on October 12 this year.

Lupin, on the other hand, is recalling 16,272 bottles of Gatifloxacin Ophthalmic Solution, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the eyes.

As per USFDA, the company’s US-based unit is recalling the affected lot due to ""failed stability specifications: Out-of-specification results observed in a water loss test that might affect the assay content and alter drug concentration.”

The affected lot has been manufactured at Lupin’s Pithampur-based plant in Madhya Pradesh.

The lot has been distributed in the US by Baltimore-based Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc, the report stated.

The drug maker initiated the nationwide (US and Puerto Rico) Class III voluntary recall on November 2 this year.

As per USFDA, a Class III recall is initiated in a ""situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.”

Emkay Global Financial's report on Sun Pharma

We maintain Hold rating on the stock as we believe the current valuations limit the upside potential in view of near-term headwinds such as 1) potential increase in R&D expense, 2) reversal of Covid and seasonal product sales in India and 3) increase in S&M costs. Q1 revenue/EBITDA/PAT beat our expectations by 3%/11%/33%. The revenue beat was driven by higher revenue in India, EM and the RoW businesses. The EBITDA beat was driven by slightly better gross margins and lower-than-expected other and R&D expenses. Global specialty sales of US$157mn included a milestone payment of US$10mn related to two specialty products. Excluding that, specialty sales were flat qoq. QoQ growth in Ilumya and Cequa was offset by Abosrica genericization and supply issues in Levulan.



Outlook

The stock is trading at a 1-year forward P/E of ~25x, which is largely in line with the historical average. We value SUNP at a 21x P/E on our Dec’23E EPS to arrive at a core business value of Rs750/share and add NPV/share of Rs25 for SCD-044 and gRevlimid.

Homegrown pharma major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd on Thursday said it has launched its medicine ILUMYA used in the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in Canada.

The company said ILUMYA (tildrakizumab injection) has already completed a five-year study based on a pooled analysis of two Phase 3 efficacy and safety extension trials in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

The results showed that patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis maintained consistent, high levels of skin clearance and a durable safety profile through five years of continuous treatment.

""In Canada, some patients involved in the study have reported still having clear skin eight years later,” Sun Pharma said in a regulatory filing.

Commenting on the development, Sun Pharma CEO North America Abhay Gandhi said, ""This launch is an important milestone for Sun Pharma, as we expand our dermatology portfolio into Canada…With five years of effective treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, ILUMYA demonstrates our commitment to providing innovative medicines to support patient lifestyle and physician choice.""

Plaque psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that appears on the skin as red, raised areas covered with flaky white scales that can crack and bleed.

It affects approximately 8.5 lakh Canadians, the company said. A key challenge is that many treatments stop working overtime and symptoms return.

Durability of treatment in the long-term is an unmet need for many patients, it added.

Sun Pharma said the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), through the Common Drug Review, has ""positively recommended to the provinces it deals with that the ILUMYA product be reimbursed for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, when prescribed by a dermatologist."""

Sun Pharma and specialty pharma firm Cassiopea SpA on Tuesday announced consummation of their exclusive licence and supply agreements for Winlevi cream used for treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older.

The agreements are effective from August 31, 2021, according to a joint statement.

Sun Pharma now has the exclusive right to commercialise Winlevi in the US and Canada. Cassiopea will be the exclusive supplier of the product, which is expected to be available in the US in the fourth quarter of 2021, it added.

Sun Pharma, North America CEO Abhay Gandhi said the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the US Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR Act) clears the path for making Winlevi available to patients and healthcare providers in the US and Canada.

""With Winlevi, a unique product with a new mechanism of action for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris, we have further expanded our basket of innovative products to serve patients better,"" he added.

The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approved Winlevi (clascoterone cream 1 percent) in August 2020 for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older, the statement said.

""We are very pleased that Winlevi will soon be widely available to dermatology healthcare providers and their patients in the US and Canada, benefiting from Sun Pharma's strong established dermatology presence,"" Cassiopea SpA CEO Diana Harbort said.

This transaction now allows Cassiopea to focus on its innovative dermatology pipeline, she added.

Sun Pharma has no immediate plans to enter into vaccine production as getting into the vertical would require an altogether different manufacturing set-up, as per a top company official.

The Mumbai-based company, which is strong in various generic therapeutic segments, is eyeing biosimilars to fuel its future growth.

“I think our preliminary assessment indicates that vaccines will require a dedicated manufacturing facility and it cannot be produced in a facility where we are making multiple other products,” Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi said in a call with analysts.

The billionaire industrialist noted that for getting into vaccine production, a completely new set of manufacturing infrastructure is required.

“So, that''s broadly our understanding. So, we currently don''t have any facility which we are looking at for producing vaccines,” Shanghvi said.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

On the biosimilar front, he noted that the drug firm is looking to develop a range of such products.

“We are evaluating development of some biosimilars which can be classified amongst the third wave of biosimilars,” Shanghvi said while clarifying that the company is looking at 2030 kind of timeline for such products to hit the market.

A biosimilar is a product which is similar to another already approved biological medicine.

The company is looking at products which have significant future patent expiry dates so that it could be amongst the first firms to get initial approvals, Shanghvi said.

“That''s the focus and priority. And that''s not the only (thing), there are multiple priorities, and also (we are) trying to find a way by which we can leverage our presence in the market so that we can successfully build a biosimilars portfolio,” he added.

He noted that the development of the biosimilars would not be a ''big drain'' on the company''s cash flow and profitability.

Commenting on the US business, he said the drug firm''s current generic pipeline for the US market includes 94 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) and nine new drug applications (NDAs) awaiting approval with the US FDA.

In 2020-21, the company launched around 18 new products in the US.

On business outlook, Shanghvi noted: “Given the uncertainties of the pandemic in the near term, we are refraining from giving guidance for FY22. However, all our businesses are well positioned and our endeavour will be to grow the business, notwithstanding the near term uncertainties related to COVID-19.”

The drug firm''s revenue from operations stood at Rs 33,498 crore in 2020-21.

Commenting on the company''s Halol plant, which has been under the USFDA radar for the last few years, Shanghvi said the drug firm is waiting for the regulator to inspect the facility.

“We have requested for an inspection. Now, I think it''s up to them to inspect the facility. And hopefully this time we should be able to clear it successfully, that''s the focus,” he added."

Emkay Global Financial's report on Sun Pharma

Q4 revenue of Rs85.2bn was largely in line with our estimates. EBITDA came in at Rs20.6bn, marginally missing our estimates by 3%. EBITDA margin of 24.2% came in line with our estimate. Adj. PAT of Rs13.4bn was also in line. Global specialty revenue of US$139mn in Q4 was in line with our expectations. Global Ilumya sales of US$143mn for FY21 puts Q4 Ilumya sales at ~US$45-47mn, a tad lower than expectations. The qoq softness was attributed to seasonally higher sales in Q3. We largely maintain FY22/23 estimates. We expect yoy margin compression in FY22 due to an increase in promotional and R&D expenses. We introduce FY24 estimates with revenue, EBITDA and EPS of Rs440bn, Rs120bn and Rs35, respectively.

Outlook

We downgrade Sun Pharma to Hold as we believe current valuations amply captures all the upside related to specialty. The stock is trading at 1-year fwd PE of 28x. We value it at 24x PE on our FY23E EPS and add SCD044 NPV of Rs15 to arrive at a TP of Rs720 (Rs660 earlier).

Motilal Oswal's research report on Sun Pharma

Sun Pharma (SUNP) delivered a 4QFY21 performance marginally below our expectations, weighed by moderation in US and API sales. Domestic Formulation (DF) business growth has been strengthening for three consecutive quarters now. Marketing efforts are driving strong performance in Illumya, a specialty product – 51% YoY growth was reported for FY21. It further intends to build a Biosimilar portfolio for launch over CY28–30. We raise our earnings estimate by 9%/8% for FY22E/FY23E, factoring in a) continued ramp-up in Illumya, led by the Specialty portfolio, b) healthy growth in the base DF portfolio as well as additions to the COVID portfolio, and c) subsequently better operating leverage. We continue to value SUNP at 25x 12M forward earnings to arrive at TP of INR740. Maintain Buy.

Outlook

Accordingly, we raise our TP to INR830 on a 25x 12M forward earnings basis. We remain positive on SUNP on its superior execution in the global Specialty portfolio / Branded Generics and a robust ANDA pipeline. Maintain Buy.

Leading home grown drug makers Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Aurobindo Pharma and Jubilant Pharma are recalling products in the US market, the world's largest market for pharmaceutical products, for various reasons.

As per the latest Enforcement Report by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), Sun Pharma is recalling Cequa ophthalmic solution, which is used to treat chronic dry eye.

The US-based subsidiary of the Mumbai-based drug major is recalling 37,400 cartons (60 vials per carton) of the ophthalmic solution for being ''subpotent'', the US health regulator said.

The Princeton (NJ) based firm initiated the nationwide recall of the affected lot on February 22, this year, it added.

Similarly, Dr Reddy's Laboratories is recalling 10,440 (90-count) and 2,24,710 (500 count) bottles of Atorvastatin Calcium tablets in the US market.

The Hyderabad-based firm is recalling the drug, which is used to prevent cardiovascular disease, for ''failed impurities/degradation specifications'', the USFDA said.

The US-based unit of the drug major initiated the nationwide recall on February 19, 2021, and the USFDA has categorised it as Class III recall which is initiated in a ''situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences''.

The drug firm is also recalling 16,449 bottles of Progesterone Capsules (200 mg), used to cause menstrual periods in women who have not yet reached menopause, in the US market for ''failed dissolution specifications''.

The company has initiated the nationwide recall of the lot on February 26, this year and the USFDA has classified it as a Class II recall which is initiated in a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.

Another Hyderabad-based drug major Aurobindo Pharma is recalling 1,296 bottles of Famotidine tablets, used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, in the US market for presence of foreign tablets.

''Famotidine 20mg and ibuprofen 400mg tablets were found in a lot of famotidine 40mg,'' the USFDA noted.

The company initiated the nationwide recall on January 20 and the USFDA has classified the action as Class II.

Besides, Salisbury-based Jubilant Cadista Pharmaceuticals is recalling 6,35,400 cartons of Methylprednisolone tablets, prescribed for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, in the American market due to ''Illegible label''.

''Customer complaint received of misalignment print of the printed dosing instructions on the blister card,'' the USFDA said.

The company initiated the nationwide recall on February 19 and the USFDA has classified the action as a Class III recall.

Jubilant Cadista Pharmaceuticals is a subsidiary of Singapore-based Jubilant Pharma, which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Noida-based Jubilant Life Sciences."

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on February 11 directed Sun Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd (SPIL) founder and Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi to pay Rs 62.35 lakh towards settling the charges by a whistleblower that the drug manufacturer had diverted funds through related-party transactions.

Sebi has conducted a probe against Shanghvi, the company, and its directors over the whistle-blower complaint. In his letter to the regulator, the whistle-blower alleged that Sun Pharma and its subsidiary, Sun Pharmaceutical Laboratories (SPLL), had diverted funds through Aditya Medisales Ltd (AML), its sole distributor in India. The probe found out that Sun Pharma had not made the relevant disclosures and AML was a related party of SPIL even before the scheme of amalgamation.

SEBI examines feasibility to introduce freight derivatives

""Disclosure of related-party transactions with AML in the Annual Reports for FY 2015-16 and FY 2016-17, was not made,” SEBI observed in its order, adding that, ""prior approval of the audit committee for transactions with AML, as required under regulation 23(2) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015, was not obtained.""

Considering that the transactions with AML would have qualified as material related-party transactions, it required approval of shareholders under regulation 23(4) of SEBI (LODR) regulations, 2015, which was not obtained. The regulator called this a violation of provisions of regulations 4(2)(f), 23(2) and 23(4) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015.

A company acts through its board of directors and the directors are responsible for all the acts of omission and commission by the company, the Sebi order said.

Sebi noted that Shanghvi was in charge of the company's operations and decision-making process. The order came into force with immediate effect.

According to reports, Shanghvi has filed a settlement order with Sebi, without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusions of law.

""SEBI's probe against Sun Pharma, its managing director Dilip Shanghvi and its directors was not entirely baseless and infact had adequate grounda for looking into the alleged diversion of funds through Aditya Medisales. It was observed that AML was a related party of SPIL even before the scheme of amalgamation. That by virtue of being a related party of Sun Pharma, the company was required to adhere to several complainces such as prior approval of shareholders and the audit committee, but violated in its entirety. The settlement plea accepted by Sun Pharma sets an example for other violators existing across industries,"" KS Legal and Associates' Managing Partner Sonam Chandwani said."

Marketing efforts for the Specialty portfolio remain constrained due to COVID-19, offering scope to gain further prescription share going forward. n We raise our FY21E/FY22E/FY23E earnings estimate by 9%/7%/7%, factoring in: a) gains from marketing in the Specialty portfolio, b) market share gain/utilizing shortage opportunities in US Generics, and c) controlled operational cost due to uncertainties related to COVID-19. n We continue to value SUNP at 25x 12 months forward earnings to arrive at our target price of INR740. We remain positive due to: a) superior execution in the Specialty portfolio, b) strong ANDA pipeline, and c) outperformance in the Branded Generics segment. Maintain Buy.

Outlook

We believe SUNP’s RoE is at a trough and would improve with 22% earnings CAGR, led by 9%/7%/10% sales CAGR in DF/US/RoW and 340bp margin expansion over FY20-23E. Maintain Buy

Pharmaceutical major Sun Pharma is on January 29 expected to report a healthy year-on-year (YoY) rise in profit and revenue for the December quarter of the financial year 2020-21.

The company's EBITDA margin may remain stable or may even increase YoY but it may show a QoQ decline as partial cost-saving measures implemented during the lockdown unwind, brokerages said.

Along with the numbers, all eyes will be on prescription trends in specialty portfolio and the company's outlook on branded generics in emerging markets.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects a 65.7 percent YoY rise in adjusted net profit and a 7.3 percent YoY rise in revenue for the quarter.

EBITDA may grow 27.5 percent YoY and EBITDA margin may rise to 24.3 percent for Q3FY21 against 20.4 percent YoY.

Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities expects the revenue of the company's US arm Taro to remain flat sequentially but ex-Taro US revenues may increase by $7 million QoQ, led by improvement in specialty sales.

""We expect global specialty business at $115 million for the quarter. We expect domestic business to grow 6 percent YoY, the rest of the world to grow 10 percent YoY, and EMs to grow 10 percent YoY,"" Kotak said.

The estimates of Kotak shows a 4.9 percent YoY rise in the company's net sales, while adjusted PAT may jump 48.3 percent YoY.

Kotak expects the company's Q3FY21 EBITDA margin at 24.2 percent, led by an increase in promotional spending. The brokerage expects the base Taro EBITDA margin to increase to 34.2 percent.

As per Kotak, Sun Pharma's EPS may grow about 49 percent YoY.

Brokerage firm ICICI Securities expects an 8.7 percent YoY rise in revenue and a 5.9 percent YoY rise in EBITDA.

""India to grow at 10 percent with recovery in the acute segment and continued traction in the chronic portfolio. The US is expected to grow 2 percent QoQ to $342 mn with traction in its specialty segment and stable performance from Taro,"" ICICI Securities said.

The Covid-19 pandemic has made drugmakers of different hues jump into action. Some got into vaccine manufacturing deals, others tried their hand at repurposing drugs, and a few have collaborated to bring antiviral drugs such as Remdesivir to the market. Most have hogged the limelight, with a few making money as well.

Amidst this buzz, India’s largest drugmaker, Sun Pharma, has chosen to be relatively quiet.

Analysts and experts tracking the company told Moneycontrol that Sun Pharma has been measured in its Covid-19 response compared to some of its smaller rivals, who are willing to bet a little more on Covid-19 interventions.

While its performance is modest compared to its rivals, to be sure, barring Remdesivir, Sun Pharma sells most of the drugs used for Covid-19 treatment, including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, doxycycline, ivermectin, methylprednisolone and vitamins, among others. But these drugs were nothing new, and have been part of Sun Pharma's portfolio for years.

The company launched one of the most affordable versions of antiviral drug Favipiravir, at Rs 35 per tablet, under the brand name FluGuard.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Sun Pharma is also testing two drugs on humans as potential treatment options for Covid-19. One is a plant-derived drug called AQCH, where it partnered with ICGEB, Italy. The drug, originally meant to treat Dengue, is being repurposed for Covid-19 given its antiviral properties. The company received permission from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in April to conduct clinical trials on 210 patients. The results of the clinical trial are expected this month.

The second drug that is being tested is Nafamostat mesylate, which is used to treat acute pancreatitis. The drug is now being tested on patients to see whether it can effectively block the entry of the new coronavirus. The trial is underway.

A Sun Pharma spokesperson refuted criticism that the company hasn’t done enough to tackle Covid-19.

He said that while Sun Pharma prefers to be low-profile, it has been quick to respond to the pandemic both by contributing generously and also by ensuring that the drugs used in Covid-19 are available to patients.

Sun Pharma’s Covid-19 efforts, however, have been overshadowed by its rivals. The company doesn’t figure in the list of companies that got licences from US drugmaker Gilead to manufacture and distribute the widely prescribed antiviral drug Remdesivir. Cipla and Hetero took the lead here.

Sun Pharma does manufacture Favipiravir, the other antiviral prescribed for mild Covid, but it competes with 20 other drugmakers. Glenmark has stolen the thunder here. Among Covid-19 vaccines too, Dr Reddy’s, which has hardly any experience in vaccines, has jumped to conduct clinical trials and distribute Russia's Sputnik vaccine. Even Aurobindo Pharma has launched a Covid-19 vaccine development programme.

Is Sun Pharma’s core business keeping it busy?

While Sun Pharma could still surprise with a possible vaccine distribution deal, so far it has largely stuck to its core business.

“Sun Pharma is in the midst of executing the rollout and ramp-up of a specialty drug portfolio, where it is investing $300-400 million per annum; maybe they don’t want to dilute their long-term focus,” said Amey Chalke, Vice President at Haitong Securities India.

Dilip Shanghvi, the founder and managing director of Sun Pharma, has set his sights on transforming the pure-play generic drugmaker into a specialty drugs-driven generics company.

The drugmaker has invested around $1 billion in the specialty business in the US, and has so far found it to be a mixed bag due to competition, higher marketing and distribution expenses, and gradual off-take in prescriptions of its products.

Read about the challenges the company faces in building a specialty business.

But there are other pressing challenges that Shanghvi is trying to address.

Other challenges

Sun Pharma’s largest manufacturing site in Halol, Gujarat, is under the USFDA scanner, stymieing approvals in the US, which are critical for its revenue growth, amid intense pricing pressure.

“Addressing those issues would be a near-time priority for the company,” said Chalke.

Those issues remain an overhang on its stock as well. Sun Pharma’s shares have risen only by 8.71 percent since January 1 on the BSE, while the BSE Healthcare Index has gained a whopping 46.44 percent.

Focus on chronic

Marketing research experts like Hari Natarajan, Founder and Managing Director of Pronto Consult, say that Sun Pharma, at heart, remains a chronic disease-driven company, despite having an exhaustive portfolio of acute drugs gained through the acquisition of Ranbaxy.

“For instance, Sun Pharma launched the cheapest drug Favipiravir for Covid-19, but its campaign isn’t a high-decibel one like the others,” Natarajan said.

Chronic drugs refer to cardiac, diabetes, neuro-psychiatry drugs, among others, where the patient has to take medication for life or an extended period of time, while acute drugs include anti-infectives and anti-pain drugs that are taken for a shorter duration.

Covid-19 drugs fall in the acute segment.

Shanghvi was the among the earliest Indian pharma entrepreneurs to realise the importance of chronic drugs. But cracking this segment would require sustainable engagement with doctors to get more prescriptions. This is where Sun Pharma excelled. Once it cracked the market for chronic disease drugs there was no looking back.

Sun Pharma became the biggest Indian drugmaker following its acquisition of Ranbaxy from Daiichi Sankyo.

This made Shanghvi, who started out humbly — his father was a distributor in Kolkata’s Dawa Bazar, dealing with Torrent Pharma drugs and the erstwhile Tamilnadu Dadha Pharmaceuticals Ltd —the richest Indian in March 2015.

Interestingly, in later years, Sun Pharma acquired Tamilnadu Dadha Pharmaceuticals, and outgrew Torrent Pharma.

Sun Pharma had revenues of Rs 32,838 crore in FY20, with a profit of Rs 4,186.8 crore. The US accounts for one-third of its sales, and India about 30 percent.

Why has Sun Pharma kept away from vaccines?

Vaccine making was never Sun Pharma’s forte. But that didn't stop other drugmakers both in India and globally jumping in due to the exceptional need for a vaccine against the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.

A top executive at a vaccine company says that Sun Pharma hasn’t played its role to the extent that one would expect from an industry leader.

“It could be due to limitations when it comes to capabilities in biotechnology required to make vaccines. Or it could be simply about being risk-averse and not getting into something that you are not familiar with,"" the above executive said.

“But they can still get into distribution of vaccines, because of their reach in terms of supply chain and distribution,” the executive added.

Sun Pharma’s spokesperson declined to comment on possibilities of the drugmaker getting to any vaccine manufacturing and distribution agreements."

Indian market fell more than 2 percent each on Monday tracking border tensions between US and China, but initial trends suggest that D-Street could see some respite on Tuesday.

Let’s look at the final tally on D-Street on Tuesday – the S&P BSE Sensex fell 839 points to 38,628 while the Nifty50 ended 260 points lower at 11,387.

Sectorally, selling pressure was seen in realty, healthcare, utilities, power, and capital goods space. On the broader market front – the S&P BSE Midcap index was down 3.7 percent while the S&P BSE Smallcap index fell 4.3 percent.

ICICI Bank fell more than 3 percent, Sun Pharma plunged more than 6 percent, and Future Retail was up 20 percent.

We have collated views of experts on what investors should do when the market resumes trading on Tuesday, 2 September:

Expert: Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities.

ICICI Bank: Hold | Target: Rs 440

The stock tested its 200-Day average at Rs 422 levels and witnessed a reversal after a sharp up move from Rs 340 levels over the past few days.

We believe that the stock could scale back to Rs 375-380 levels which is 50% retracement of the move and it would be a good opportunity to add longs.

On the higher side crossover of its long-term averages would give a fresh up move for a target of Rs 440 levels.

Sun Pharma: Buy on declines

The stock made a new 52-week high at Rs 560 levels but failed to hold and declined sharply along with the broader market correction.

We believe that the stock will remain sideways and witnessed a time correction from current levels. On the downside, key supports are placed at Rs 485-490 levels to invest at lower levels

Future Retail: Hold| Book Profits at Rs 190-195

The stock has locked at the upper circuit with positive news flow of the merger ratio and a breakout above its medium-term averages.

We believe that it will face resistance near to its 200-Day average at Rs 195 levels and after a rapid move we recommend to book profits at higher levels.

Drug major Sun Pharma on Tuesday said its arm DUSA Pharmaceuticals has reached a resolution with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) concerning the promotion of Levulan Kerastick and BLU-U on payment of $20.75 million (around Rs 148.51 crore).

""DUSA fully cooperated with DOJ in its investigation of a complaint filed by a former employee in September 2016,” Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said in a regulatory filing.

Under the civil settlement agreements signed with the DOJ, DUSA will pay $20.75 million to resolve allegations related to the promotion of Levulan Kerastick (aminolevulinic acid HCL) and BLU-U, it stated.

The product is indicated for the treatment of minimally to moderately thick actinic keratoses of the face or scalp.

Sun Pharma said DUSA had already made a provision towards this in its fourth quarter financials for the year ended March 31, 2020.

""The settlement does not constitute any admission by DUSA of any liability or wrongdoing"", the company added.

As part of the resolution, DUSA and Sun Pharma have entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the US Department of Health and Human Services.

Under the settlement pact, the DOJ has agreed not to bring any action seeking to exclude DUSA or Sun Pharma from participating in Federal health care programs.

In a separate agreement, Sun Pharma said DUSA also fully resolved all allegations made by the former employee.

Shares of Sun Pharma were trading 0.18 percent lower at Rs 532.40 apiece on BSE."

Emkay Global Financial's report on Sun Pharma

Sharp cut in opex, lower R&D spends and rise in gross margins boosted EBITDA margins by 765bps qoq to 24.3%. These trends are common across companies. On the other hand, SUNP’s US sales fell 25% qoq − the sharpest so far among covered names. The US business was largely impacted by a 38% qoq decline in specialty portfolio (at US$78mn) and 33% in Taro (63% of portfolio is derma, which is one of the severely hit segments). SUNP’s own generic business was flat qoq. India growth of +3% yoy beat our estimate of a 3% decline (chronic skew aided). Opex cut in Q1 is unlikely to sustain as marketing activity picks up from Q2 onward. With a slow ramp-up in the specialty portfolio, we expect limited margin expansion in the interim due to generic competition in Absorica (Dec’20), increase in India field force (by around 10%) and increase in R&D spends. We expect flat margins over FY20-22E.



Outlook

We raise FY22/23E EPS by 5% each and increase the TP to Rs542 as we roll over to 23x June’22E EPS (vs. 20x earlier). Higher multiple is on account of the reducing overhang of DOJ penalty with the recent settlement. We retain Hold and UW in EAP.

We remain positive on SUNP due to the gradually improving outlook for its Specialty portfolio, robust ANDA pipeline, and increasing market share in India and other emerging markets (EMs).

Indian pharma major Sun Pharma's June quarter numbers are expected to be subdued due to high base effect and weak domestic business because of COVID-19.

Sun Pharma will release its June quarter scorecard on July 31.

Global brokerage firm Phillip Capital expects Sun Pharma's sales to remain muted due to the high base of last year and underperformance in domestic business because of COVID.

""Led by a high base of last year in the US, margins may contract by 120 bp, resulting in flat EBITDA. PAT may see a 10 percent decline mainly due to base effect,"" Phillip Capital said.

Phillip Capital expects Sun Pharma's revenue to see a 1 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline and a 4.4 percent YoY decline in EBITDA.

Brokerages believe besides the number, outlook on global specialty business and prescription trends in specialty portfolio will be in the focus of investors.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects Sun Pharma's US sales to come in at $386 million, down 9 percent YoY due to one-time opportunity in Q1FY20.

The high base of the last year in the US and COVID-19 impact on branded generics may keep Sun Pharma's sales flat on YoY basis, Motilal Oswal believes.

As per the estimates of Motilal Oswal, the Q1 results may come out softer.

Motilal Oswal expects a 29.7 percent YoY fall in Q1 adjusted net profit while net revenue may slip by 0.6 percent YoY. EBITDA is likely to see a 14.9 percent YoY decline.

On the other hand, Kotak Institutional Equities expects Sun Pharma's EBITDA margins at 18.4 percent (flat QoQ), given adverse operating leverage with consolidated revenues declining nearly 3 percent.

Kotak expects a 3.2 percent YoY drop in net sales, 25.1 percent YoY fall in EBITDA and 540 bps YoY fall in EBITDA margin.

Adjusted PAT, as per Kotak, may fall 49.1 percent YoY.

Emkay Global sees a 7 percent YoY fall in Q1 net sales and a 60 percent YoY fall in PAT. EBITDA, as per Emkay, may drop 34 percent YoY which will lead to a 690 bps YoY fall in EBITDA margin.

""US should decline led by a hit on the specialty portfolio and Taro sales (derma concentration). India sales should be relatively better than peers and decline only marginally due to a higher Chronic portfolio. Margins should be flat QoQ as Q4 base had employee provision in a subsidiary and Rs 140 crore forex loss,"" said Emkay Global.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Sun Pharma

Post the reduction in prescriptions in the Specialty portfolio at the start of lockdown, a gradual improvement has been witnessed in the same with the easing of the lockdown. The stockpiling of medicines related to chronic therapies has been offset, to some extent, by a lower patient-doctor connect for acute therapies in the key markets of SUNP. The addition of MRs would further support growth, particularly in Domestic Formulations (DF).



Outlook

We lower our FY21/FY22E EPS estimates by 6.8%/2% to factor the COVID-19-led slowdown and revise our price target to INR525 (from INR535 earlier) on a 22x 12M forward earnings basis. We remain positive on SUNP on account of a gradually improving outlook for the Specialty portfolio, a robust ANDA pipeline, and increasing market share in DF. Maintain Buy.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

These will be made available to healthcare professionals serving their communities and the nation, it added.

In a related development, the company's arm Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc USA said it has donated 2.5 million hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for use in the US.

Sun Pharma, India's largest drug maker, on October 14 announced the launch of the much awaited specialty drug Cequa to treat dry eye disease in US.

The launch, which was originally planned in the second half of FY19, got delayed to Q3FY20, due to certain challenges related to manufacturing and supply chain.

With the launch of Cequa, much of Sun Pharma's specialty product pipeline has been rolled out in the US.

The company has so far launched five specialty assets Bromsite to treat eye pain, Odomzo for skin cancer, Yonsa - prostate cancer, Ilumya (IL-23) – psoriasis and Xelpros – for ocular hypertension.

The focus of the company will be now on execution and ramp-up, where things have been so far a mixed bag due to competition, higher marketing and distribution expenses and gradual off-take in prescriptions of its products.

Sun Pharma has invested around $1 billion in the specialty business in the US. It built its speciality business through a series of acquisitions over the years. The specialty portfolio generated revenues of $94 million across all markets in Q1FY20.

Will Cequa turned the tide?

Cequa, analysts believe has the potential to turn the tide.

CLSA expects Cequa to generate $100-125 million in peak sales.

“Assuming 7-10% market share over a 3-4 year period, Cequa has the potential to generate peak sales potential of US$100-125 million despite potential competition from the Restasis generic,” CLSA said in its report.

Sun Pharma got hold of Cequa or the cyclosporine ophthalmic solution 0.09%, through acquisition of Ocular Technologies from global private equity firm Auven Therapeutics in 2016. Sun Pharma paid an an upfront payment of $40 million, in addition to milestone payments and royalties.

Dry eyes, scientifically called as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is characterised with lack of tear production in eyes resulting in persistent irritation and affecting vision in the longer term. It’s a chronic disease, as the person diagnosed with dry eye will have to take the medication throughout life.

Around 34 million people in US are estimated to have dry eyes, of which only half are diagnosed, only 1.6 million are treated by prescription (Rx) drugs.

This is where Cequa comes in, the medication boosts the tear production in patients with dry eye.

While Cequa faces competition in form of Allergan’s Restasis with sales of $1.2 billion in 2018 and Novartis Xiidra $400 million, what could work in favour of Sun Pharma’s Cequa is that it offers higher concentration cyclosporine for ophthalmic use than competing drugs and is delivered with nanomicellar technology which results in improved ocular tissue penetration.

Sun Pharma is leaving no stone unturned for a successful launch. The sales force required for CEQUA's promotion is fully on board. The company also introduced Cequa Support, an access program designed to enable commercially insured patients to easily obtain Cequa. This program is structured to minimize out-of-pocket cost and provides free home delivery of the drug.

But CLSA says it all boils down to how Sun Pharma convinces eye specialists on the efficacy of the product, get it listed in formulary (particularly Medicare Part D) and come up with the right pricing.

Formularies are lists that have the insurance carriers preferred drugs.

“While an impending generic for Restasis can be a threat, we believe a superior product will see formulary acceptance if priced well. The next launch is likely 2-3 years away, as it is currently undergoing Phase-3 trials,” CLSA said.

According to Drugs.com 60 units of Cequa cost $538.81, which is 9 percent cheaper than rival Retasis which is priced at $591.6 per 60 units.

Sun Pharma drug is dosed twice daily and will be available as a single-use vial.

The success of Cequa in US would depend on how Sun Pharma would gain market share from well-entrenched rivals like Allergan and Novartis."

Indian markets saw another day of profit-taking on August 30, largely led by weak global cues. The Nifty held on to its crucial support at 10,900, while the Sensex broke below 37,000 intraday.

The BSE Public Sector index was down by around 2 percent, followed by the BSE Power index, and the Capital Goods index. On the other hand, metals, FMCG and healthcare stocks saw some buying.

We have collated a list of stocks that were in focus on August 29 because of their price action. The technical outlook is limited to near and medium-terms:

Analyst: Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research

Lemon Tree Hotels: No respite in the near term; could fall towards Rs 44

Lemon Tree witnessed a sharp fall on August 29 after reports suggested that more than 30 million equity shares of the company changed hands via block deals.

In terms of technical outlook, the stock is in a bearish momentum, with price action suggesting no reversal in the primary trend, which has been largely sideways to bearish since it got listed.

The stock may continue the bearish momentum and can slide further towards Rs 44.

Indiabulls Housing Finance: Technical bounce towards Rs 500 possible

Indiabulls Housing Finance has already lost over 60 percent in the last year and will be removed from the index.

The stock is trading in a downward channel and the prices are making lower tops and lower bottoms, a bearish sign.

In the short term, the double bottom is seen in price action, while RSI on these bottoms has indicated a divergence. A short-term swing can be seen in prices that can lead to an upside target of Rs 500-525, with a stop loss placed below Rs 425.

Sun Pharma: Short-term buy signal for an upside target of Rs 480

Sun Pharma rallied after reports suggested that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had cleared the company of charges of irregularities.

In terms of technicals, a triangle pattern is seen in price action and a breakout is impending. With price action favouring the bullish bias, we believe that a close above Rs 444 can trigger a short-term buy signal for an upside target of Rs 480, and a stop loss can be at Rs 412.

Nestle India: Stay put as the stock is heading towards Rs 14,000 levels

The upcoming addition to the Nifty has further sparked a bullish trend, with prices breaking out from a pennant formation, a bullish continuation pattern.

The upside trend may continue, given the recent breakout and buy on dips should be utilised for a target of Rs 13,700-14,600, and a stop loss can be placed below Rs 12,100.

RBL Bank: Take a contra call as long as the stock trades above Rs 290

RBL Bank came under selling pressure on August 29 over speculation of insider trading. The bank, however, later clarified that market transactions by employees were a “routine activity"" with regular exercise of ESOPs (employee stock ownership plans) and sale of equity shares thereafter.

In terms of technicals, a high volatility price action was seen, with a selloff indicating that price may stabilise in the short term if long-term support at Rs 290 holds.

A cool-off in volatility can be followed by a consolidation in the short term. At present, having a contra view may result in catching a falling knife, hence it is important for stock to sustain Rs 290 to see further price movement.

Cautious and tepid commentaries by several corporates raise concern for the further earnings downgrades. Thus Q2FY20 is also expected to be muted with a visible slowdown in discretionary spending all over, Yogesh Mehta, founder of Yield Maximisers, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts:

Q: Domestic and global cues point towards a possible recession across the globe which could, in turn, affect India's growth story. What are your views?

A: Fear of slowing US economy is rising day by day and the data also indicates India can’t remain immune for a longer time if the situation of the US and China trade tension intensifies further.

The new monster of inversion of yield curve emerged in the US bonds may see the ripple effect of slowing down in FII investment inflows in India that can be seen as not encouraging for Indian markets.

Q: How did India Inc. fare in the June quarter earnings?

A: Q1FY20 corporate earnings disappointed the street, Nifty PAT grew merely 5 percent YoY, compared to an estimate of 12 percent.

Cautious and tepid commentaries by several corporates raise concern for the further earnings downgrades. Thus Q2FY20 is also expected to be muted with a visible slowdown in discretionary spending all over.

Q: Top five outperformers and underperformers from the Q1 season.

A: Outperformers

UltraTech Cement:

UltraTech Cement reported an all-time high EBIDTA growth led by realisation beat and deleveraging focus.

Asian Paints: With 24 percent EBIDTA growth aided by high double-digit volume growth, this stock stands out as a clear outperformer.

Sun Pharma: EBIDTA growth of 24 percent was largely in-line with US sales. Ilumya is gaining traction and normalise R&D spending from Q2 will support the stock.

Zee Entertainment: The media company reported 47 percent YoY jump in the domestic subscriptions with expansion in margins, which is a positive sign.

Underperformers:

Tata Motors: The global automaker disappointment the Street, weighed down by sharp margin contraction in JLR and India business, and even guidance was revised down to 3-4 percent for FY20.

ONGC: PAT was down due to one-off provision and higher interest cost.

SBI: Higher credit cost and higher slippages.

Tata Steel: Weak margins, weak outlook and capex cut by 25percent. The net profit was down 53 percent.

Q: FIIs have been pulling out money from Indian markets consistently since July while MF absorbed most of that selling. But, do you think the momentum will continue?

A: FIIs sold equities worth Rs 15,000 crores in July. Nifty corrected about 8.5 percent from all-time highs of 12,103.

FII selling momentum may continue if current economic pressures and weak earnings persist.

Q: With global recession looming large, gold is all set to clock Mount 40K on MCX. Do you think it is the right time to invest in gold or gold ETF?

A: The way US-China trade war is getting intensified, due to tumbling bond yields they are no more attractive, hence, gold is catching momentum as safe heaven (asset class). If INR weakens further and international gold price rises further one can still invest in gold.

Q: Auto sector has been under pressure with more firms opting for shutdowns. Do you think this sector could produce wealth creators if someone buys the stocks at current levels with a time frame of 2-3 years?

A: Demand for auto has tapered down and the auto index is back to its 2014 levels which are providing an opportunity for investors but at current levels, it is like a half glass full and half glass empty.

However, with 2-3 year timeframe, staggered investment in the leaders of the sector is recommended but not as a wealth creator.

Sun Pharma, India's largest drug maker, said on August 16 that it had granted an exclusive license to a subsidiary of China Medical System Holdings(CMS) to develop and commercialize seven generic products in Mainland China.

The collaboration with CMS now covers eight generic products, which include the seven products referred above.

The total addressable market size for all these eight products is about $1 billion (as per recent IQVIA data) in Mainland China.

The initial term of the agreement shall be 20 years from the first commercial sale of the respective products in Mainland China and may be extended for additional three years’ as per mutual agreement of the two parties, the company said in a statement.

“This collaboration gives us entry into the Chinese generic pharmaceutical market. We see lot of potential in China for both our generics and speciality portfolio,"" said Dilip Shanghvi, Managing Director, Sun Pharma

""With more than 65 percent generics penetration, China represents a significant opportunity for generic pharmaceutical companies,” Shanghvi added.

In June 2019, Sun Pharma had announced a collaboration with CMS on two speciality products, Tildrakizumab and Cyclosporine A 0.09 percent (CsA) eye drops for the Greater China market.

Indian drug makers are increasingly focusing on the world's second largest drug market on the back of reforms such as faster approvals for drugs approved by USFDA."

HDFC Securities' research report on Sun Pharma

Sun Pharma improved its operational performance on all parameters driven by a one-time generic order in the US and lower R&D spend. Revenue/EBITDA/PAT were up 16/14/31% YoY in 1QFY20. At US$ 424mn, the US revenues grew 16/-6% YoY/QoQ, largely driven by a one-time six-month contract during the last two quarters. The top-line is likely to normalize from 2Q onwards. However, overall US revenues were still ahead of expectations in 1QFY20. We believe specialty ramp-up remains the key contributor for Sun Pharma to grow its US top line over the next two years. Anticipate ~10% CAGR over FY19-21. Ilumya scale-up continues to happen at a slow rate. Post the restructuring in 4QFY19, India biz grew 8% YoY to Rs 23bn in 1QFY20. According to the management, the underlying growth remains at 12-13%. We continue to model India segment’s growth at high single digits with slowed IPM growth over the last 2 years. An 8.2% market share and leadership across all therapies make it difficult to outperform the IPM rate, in our view. EBITDA margin at 23% was up 807bps QoQ, 228bps higher than expectations as R&D spend fell to 5% of sales v/s expectation of ~7.5%. Discretionary specialty spend continues to weigh in on margin expansion.

Outlook

We maintain BUY on SUNP following a beat to our estimates. Our TP is at Rs 545 (22x FY21E EPS). The execution in specialty segment is crucial.

Sun Pharma has announced a major senior management rejig, giving additional responsibilities to Aalok Shanghvi, son of Dilip Shanghvi, the promoter and Managing Director.

Aalok, who is currently the Senior-Vice President, Emerging Markets and Global R&D, will have additional responsibility for generic business development.

Aalok, who joined the company in 2007 as product manager, holds a degree in molecular biology from University of Michigan.

Kal Sundaram, who was India and emerging markets head, will now be responsible for Japan and China businesses besides the company's strategic initiatives. Kirti Ganorkar, who was heading the global business development function, will now head the India formulations business.

Shares of Sun Pharma fell over 5 percent intraday on August 14, a day after the company said its June quarter profit increased 31 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,387.5 crore from Rs 1,057.3 crore. Sequentially, profit grew 118 percent in Q1 FY20.

Following the results, the scrip jumped 4 percent on August 13 but failed to hold the gains, falling prey to profit-booking.

Brokerages have mixed views on the stock.

HSBC has a hold recommendation on Sun Pharma, with a target price of Rs 400 per share.

The brokerage highlighted that the Q1 numbers were largely in-line at the operating levels, but cost pressure will continue due to ongoing spend for Ilumya & Cequa. “Execution of speciality launches remain key for sustainable earnings growth.”

CLSA, on the other hand, maintained a buy rating on the stock, raising the target price to Rs 540 from Rs 520.

The foreign brokerage said that the company is gradually getting back on track and the ramp-up of the speciality product portfolio will be a key catalyst for growth.

“Strong execution could drive a re-rating of the stock,” said the brokerage.

Credit Suisse has a neutral call on the stock with a target price of Rs 470, citing Q1 results are in-line with estimates.

As per the global brokerage, the ramp-up of Ilumya will be key for upside which may be slow with strong progress of Skyriz. “US sales will normalise from Q2 and it may take 3-4 quarters before the new disclosure will reveal Ilumya growth.”

At the operating level, Sun Pharma's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew 24.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,996 crore and margin expanded 160bps YoY to 23.8 percent in Q1.

Profit was estimated at Rs 1,052.6 crore on the revenue of Rs 8,177.6 crore and EBITDA was expected at Rs 1,743 crore with margin at 21.3 percent for the quarter, according to a poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18.

Sun Pharma on June 14 announced promising interim results from a Phase 2 study on Ilumya, a drug used to treat active psoriatic arthritis in patients. The announcement was made at the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology in Madrid, Spain.

Ilumya is already approved in the US for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and is now being investigated for psoriatic arthritis. The positive results for additional indication can help Sun Pharma to expand its sales of the drug.

Ilumya, generically called as tildrakizumab-asmn, belongs to the class of interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor, which is used for the treatment of the most common plaque psoriasis – a chronic immune disease that causes red, scaly patches of dead skin cells to appear on the skin.

The interim analysis revealed that over 71 percent of patients treated with Ilumya experienced a 20 percent improvement in joint and skin symptoms, meeting the primary endpoint of the study, Sun Pharma said in a statement.

The interim results showed Ilumya was well tolerated, with a low rate of adverse events from the treatment, the company added.

Psoriatic arthritis, which affects up to 42 percent of people with plaque psoriasis, is an inflammatory condition that impacts both the joints and skin. It is painful, causes fatigue, and can lead to swelling and stiffness of the joints that may reduce range of motion. If left untreated, this chronic condition can lead to permanent joint damage.

Sun Pharma acquired rights for Tildrakizumab from US drug maker Merck in 2014 for $80 million.

While Merck was responsible for completion of phase-3 clinical trials and the submission of its biologics license application (BLA) to the US FDA, Sun Pharma will be responsible for all other regulatory activities, including subsequent submissions, drug safety, post approval studies, manufacturing and commercialization of the approved product.

Analysts estimate the peak sales of the Ilumya to be around $300 million."

HDFC Securities' research report on Sun Pharma

Revenue growth was muted during the quarter due to a one-time impact of Rs 11bn on domestic sales with the shift to direct distribution (from AML earlier). Adjusting for this, sales would stand at Rs 85bn (+18/7% YoY/QoQ). India sales at Rs 11bn were down 44% YoY. Adjusting for the one-off, sales grew 11% YoY. The co launched 4 new products during the quarter and continues to hold the highest market share in IPM (~8.2%). We expect the co to grow at 9-10% CAGR over FY19 -21E driven by its strong branded franchise. The impact of change in distributor has been borne and won’t persist. US sales at US$ 443mn grew 22% QoQ boosted by a new contract for certain generics as well as traction gained in Taro. With the new DTC marketing ongoing for Ilumya and field force ready for Cequa’s launch (2QFY20), the mgmt. is confident in ramping up its specialty segment consistently over the next few years. We expect the segment to breakeven by FY22E. Expenditure on front-end will remain unabsorbed until then, thereby denting overall profitability. EBITDA was at Rs 10.2bn with margin at 14.2% (- 994/962bps YoY/QoQ). The one-time hit on sales due to change in distributor impacted profitability severely during 4Q. PAT stood at Rs 6.4bn (-51/32% YoY/QoQ).

Outlook

We maintain BUY on SUNP following a miss to our estimates owing to a one-off. Our TP is revised to Rs 600/sh (22x FY21E EPS + Rs 40/sh for specialty). Hopes are hinged on a ramp up in specialty business.

Sun Pharma: Stock is in a major downtrend, can see a pullback

Sun Pharma recovered after falling over 7 percent in intraday trade on May 16. The stock is in a major downtrend but the past few days’ price action is indicating that it is making a strong bottom around Rs 390. We can expect a pullback rally towards 50-DMA of Rs 460 but a closing below Rs 390 would change the structure to bearish.

Lupin: Level of Rs 730 is acting as a strong base

Lupin recovered after falling about 6 percent in trade on May 16. The stock has been under pressure since it posted its Q4 results. It looks like Rs 730 level is acting as a strong base for Lupin and there is a very high probability that it can move higher from here.

On the upside, Rs 840-880 is still a strong supply zone; above which it may start a strong bull run.

Bajaj Finance: Stock in a strong uptrend remain invested

Bajaj Finance rallied after Q4 results to reclaim Rs 3,100. It closed with gains of nearly 4 percent and was among the top Nifty gainer.

Bajaj Finance is in a strong uptrend where it is consolidating after a strong bull run. Going forward, a move above the all-time high of Rs 3,160 can lead another 500 points rally while a break below Rs 2,800 could lead to profit taking.

Tata Chemicals: May face resistance around Rs 620-650

Tata Chemicals closed 8 percent higher on merger announcement. The stock has created a strong base at Rs 555. On the upside, it has a strong supply zone at Rs 620-650 band. A close above these levels could take the stock towards the Rs 700-725.

Tata Global Beverage: Stock could hit a target of Rs 280 in the coming week

Tata Global Beverages rallied about 10 percent on the merger announcement. Tata Global is bottoming with a bullish inverse head and shoulder pattern where we can expect a target of Rs 280 in the coming week.

On the upside, Rs 235 would act as an immediate hurdle for the stock while Rs 210 would act as immediate and strong support for the stock.

YES Bank: Stock looking weak on charts; support at Rs 130-120

Yes Bank fell over 4 percent on May 16. The private sector bank is looking very weak after it witnessed a closing below strong support of Rs 145.

On the downside, Rs 130-120 zone would be the next target for this counter while only a close above Rs 145 can lead to any positive momentum.

The homegrown drugmakers are among the 21 generic pharmaceutical firms and 15 other individual defendants against whom the Attorneys General of 49 US states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia had filed a complaint with respect to 116 generic drugs in the US District Court for the District of Connecticut.

The companies have been accused of violating antitrust laws by fixing prices and allocating customers.

In separate clarifications to stock exchanges, the companies denied the accusations and stated they would defend themselves in the matter.

Dr Reddy's said, ""We intend to vigorously defend against these allegations and are in the process of filing our response with the District Court of Connecticut.""

The company said its US subsidiary is specifically named as a defendant with respect to five generic drugs (Ciprofloxacin HCL tablets, Glimepiride tablets, Oxaprozin tablets, Paricalcitol and Tizanidine), for an alleged ""overarching conspiracy"".

It further said,""Currently, we do not foresee any material impact to our operations and consolidated results with respect to this matter.""

Sun Pharma in a regulatory filing said that its subsidiary Taro Pharmaceuticals USA Inc has been named in the second lawsuit filed by the states. ""The allegations made in these lawsuits are without merit and our concerned subsidiaries will continue to vigorously defend against them,"" the company said in its clarification to stock exchanges over a news article.

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited has not been named in these litigations, the drug major clarified.

Wockhardt also said anti-trust action relates to price hike of various generic drugs. The company has denied such accusation at appropriate Forum and is vigorously defending against the matter.

Similarly, Glenmark said in December 2016 a similar law suit was filed and the latest one includes some of the parties from the first one as well as additional parties with allegations of fixing prices of additional products which were not referenced in the first law suit.

""While the company is currently reviewing the second suit, we expect to file papers with the Federal Court in due course denying the accusations. Given the early nature of the matter, the company does not anticipate material impact of the same,"" Glenmark added.

Aurobindo Pharma also said it is currently reviewing the second anti-trust law suit.

""We expect that we will be filing papers with the Federal Court in due course denying each of the relevant accusations. Aurobindo does not, at this time, anticipate that these matters will have a material impact on the Company's operations or business results,"" it added."

The Nifty50 closed in the red for the 9th consecutive day in a row on May 13 to post its longest losing run in the past 8 years. The index lost over 600 points in the last 9 sessions, which pushed it below the crucial support level of 100-days EMA as well as 11,200 levels.

The final tally on D-Street – the S&P BSE Sensex plunged 372 points to close at 37,090 while the Nifty50 fell 130 points to close at 11,148.

Indian markets witnessed a rangebound trade in the first half of the trading session but bears soon took control and pushed the index in deep red in the second half.

These four factors weighed on D-Street: a) on-going tensions between the US & China kept investors on the edge across Asian markets, b) weak economic data as well as, and c) disappointing results from India Inc, d) In terms of technicals, a break below 100-days exponential moving averages followed by 11200 levels added to selling pressure. The next target for the index is placed around its 100-days EMA placed around 11035 levels. The near term resistance zone, on the other hand, shifts lower to 11280-11300.

Also Read: Technical View: Nifty forms bearish candle for 9th day; support likely around 200-DMA

After closing below 100-days EMA, the next support for the index is placed around 200-days EMA and resistance is placed around 11300 levels on the upside, suggest experts.

""Technically, with Nifty moving further down, the short-term trend remains down. The Nifty could now head towards the next major supports of 11024, which corresponds to the 200-day EMA. Any pullback rallies could find resistance at 11300,"" Subash Gangadharan, Technical Analyst, HDFC Securities, told Moneycontrol.

""The recent selloff seems to be more due to weak global equity sentiments on account of the ongoing trade war between USA and China. Given this scenario, we recommend investors to remain on the sidelines till we see evidence of a new technical uptrend,"" he said.

We have collated technical outlook on stocks which moved the most on D-Street and what should investors do now:

Analyst: Manish Yadav, Head of Research, CapitalAim

Sun Pharma: Time to go short!

This stock has been trading below 200-DMA and making lower highs and lows for some time now. On May 13, it breached Rs 400 levels on the downside.

It has support around 370-390 but it seems unlikely that the stock will hold on to that level. Traders can go short on any up-move. The stock closed 9.3 percent lower at Rs 396.85.

ITC: Traders can buy the stock around Rs 280

The stock is trading above its 200-DMA and has strong support around 260-275 levels. We are positive on this stock and the next up move can take it towards Rs 310-317 levels in the short to medium term. Traders can buy the stock around 280 with a stop loss of 269 for a target of 310. The stock closed 2.6 percent lower at Rs 289.85.

Eicher Motors: Traders can stay away

The stock was moving in a tight range for the last couple of days but in Monday's trade, it broke down more than 5 percent now. This downslide may continue with short-term support around Rs 18,800. Traders should stay away from this stock.

The stock closed 7.6 percent lower at 18,766. It hit a 52-week low of Rs 18600 on the BSE.

YES Bank: Time to book profits or exit

YES Bank is oversold and can give a bounce back. It can be bought as a short-term trade around 152-55 levels with a stop-loss below 149 with a target of 170. However, anyone holding the stock should look at getting out at any bounce back.

The stock closed 5.5 percent lower at Rs 154.85 on May 13.

L&T: Medium-term traders may initiate buy around Rs 1,250

This stock may trade lower in the near-term and test lower levels of Rs 1240-50 in the short term. I will not advise investors to buy the stock for the short term. However, medium-term traders may initiate buy around 1250 for a target of 1380-1400 in the medium term.

In the long term, the stock looks positive and can trade around over Rs 1500 levels in a year’s time. The stock closed 2.8 percent lower at Rs 1317.

IDFC First Bank: Stay away for now

This stock has peaked out around 56 levels and is now sliding towards 40. In the short-term, it may go lower towards Rs 35 levels. Traders must stay away from this stock and try to get out in any bounce back. The stock closed 12% lower at Rs 42.95.

Indiabulls Housing Finance: Short term traders can trade with a stop-loss around 650

This stock has made a peak of 919.40 and since then it is making lower highs and lower lows. In the medium-term, we expect the stock to slide further towards 575 level, but in a pullback, it can give an up-move from here to 710 levels.

Short term traders can trade with a stop-loss around Rs 650 and anyone holding the stock can sell on bounce-back. The stock closed 5.2% lower at 659.

Rocked by allegations of questionable corporate governance practices, Sun Pharma said it will constitute a corporate governance and ethics committee to oversee corporate governance related matters.

The company said that it will formalise the corporate governance and ethics committee in the upcoming board meet.

""Our learning is that apart from being right—legally and technically—we also have to take into consideration how the transaction would be perceived by the world outside. Even though our actions were legal and in the best interests of the company, we thought it is important to address investor concerns,"" said Sun Pharma's Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi in an interview to The Economic Times.

Shanghvi further added that the company will remain committed to creating long-term value for shareholders .

On Sudhir Valia, Shanghvi said he continues to be a valuable resource for the company, but over the last couple of years, he has decided to focus more on pursuits outside Sun Pharma.

Sudhir Valia, promoter-director and brother-in-law of Shanghvi, has come under lens for alleged diversion of funds to his real estate firm Suraksha Realty from Sun Pharma. Sun Pharma has denied these allegations.

India's largest drugmaker's corporate governance practices are under scanner on reports of a whistleblower's complaint to SEBI highlighted Sun Pharma's dealing with subsidiary AML. It also made allegations of money laundering and lending by AML to Suraksha Realty.

Market regulator SEBI has swung into action, and has raised queries on Sun Pharma seeking details of those alleged transactions.

Moneycontrol was unable to independently review the whistleblower's complaint. The report alleged the Sun Pharma's payment to Aditya Medisales was transferred to the promoter and group companies between 2014 and 2017.

In another complaint last year, the whistleblower is said to have alleged irregularities involved two or three major rounds of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) issues by Sun Pharma during 2002-2007, which was managed by Jermyn Capital, that had links with banned traders Ketan Parekh and Dharmesh Doshi.

They were also allegations related to insider trading and loans to third parties without proper disclosures.

Damage control mode

Sun Pharma's stock that saw rally last year on resolution of US FDA warning letter on its key Halol manfucturing site in Gujarat, however lost steam towards the end of the year. The company's shares plunged 33 percent from 52 week high and were trading at Rs 454.35, in the process the company lost close to five billion dollars in market value.

Some foreign brokerage firms have downgraded the stock, while others have exited raising concerns over governance.

Alarmed by these developments, Sun Pharma's management has swung into action. To limit the damage, the company had discontinued the super stockist arrangement with AML and also announced unwinding of loans given to third parties.

The management in January had met foreign institutional investors (FIIs) like Goldman Sachs and Temasek, and apprised them of actions taken and company's growth story.

On the business front, Sun Pharma is facing pricing pressure in US and a antitrust litigation settlement related to a generic drug called Modafinil. The payoff related to the company's bet on specialty pipeline, with launches of three specialty drugs in US, may take longer time than anticipated.

China focus

Shanghvi said he is focusing on entering new growth markets like China.

Sun Pharma earlier tried to get into China but had to exit to difficult conditions to operate in that market.

Currently, the presence of Indian drugmakers in Chinese market is miniscule. It used to take around five years to get an approval in China to get marketing authorisation even for a generic drug. It takes around 10 months in US and 3-6 months in India for a similar approval.

Commerce Ministry data shows that India exported around $27.11 million worth of pharmaceutical products to China during FY17, while its total Indian pharma exports during the same period stood at $16.84 billion.

On contrast, India imported close to $2 billion worth of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates in FY17 from China.

But drug makers say things have started easing in China, with Chinese government's focus on improving overall quality of drugs sold in their country. China had earlier said it will not take much time to approve drugs filed from US FDA compliant facilities and reduced tariffs on many cancer drugs."

The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has given voluntary action indicated classification to drug major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries for its Dadra plant.

The health regulator had inspected the company's Dadra facility from March 22 - March 29, 2019; and at the conclusion of the inspection, had issued a Form 483, with 11 observations to the company.

In a notification on its website, USFDA has given Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI) classification to the Dadra inspection.

As per the USFDA, VAI means that though ""objectionable conditions or practices were found, but the agency is not prepared to take or recommend any administrative or regulatory action"".

In a regulatory filing in April, Sun Pharma had said that it had submitted response to the USFDA within the stipulated timeline and it was committed to addressing the observations promptly.

One of the observations by the USFDA related to employees engaged in manufacturing, processing, packaging and holding of a drug product were lacking education, training and experience required to perform their assigned functions.

Another issue flagged was that the quality control unit lacked the authority to fully investigate errors that have occurred.

Shares of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries were trading at Rs 454.50 per scrip on BSE, down 0.54 per cent from its previous close."

Valia & Timbadia were auditors to some of Sun Pharma’s subsidiaries.

A source in the department told Moneycontrol: ""The auditor has registered a complaint stating that the broking house prepared false sale notes and circulated it to their clients, which impacted the stock price negatively.""

Elaborating on the same, the source stated: ""The auditor moved EOW alleging Macquarie mischievously intended to profit by issuing a sales note against Sun Pharma. Post this note and whistleblower letter, the company’s investors incurred heavy losses and the promoters’ net worth too took a hit. The complainant has pegged the loss at Rs 100 per share, but failed to mention the exact quantum of loss.""

However, Sun Pharma's spokesperson said they are unaware of any such complaint and that they haven't filed a case against Macquarie with the EOW.

Confirming receipt of the complaint two weeks back, another EOW source said, “The department is exploring whether this complaint comes under its jurisdiction. We will seek details from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) as well as trade data from exchanges.""

Valia & Timbadia couldn't be reachable for a comment. Macquarie too refused to comment to a query from Moneycontrol.

BackgroundMacquarie, an Australian multinational independent investment bank and financial services company, questioned corporate governance practices at Sun Pharma, causing the drugmaker's shares to end at a six-month low on November 29, 2018.

The report, written by a trader, raised concerns over inadequate disclosures about the company's links with banned traders Ketan Parekh and Dharmesh Doshi, related transactions, and role of promoter Dilip Shanghvi's brother-in-law Sudhir Valia, who is a Director in Sun Pharma. It also raised questions about real estate guarantees provided to Suraksha Reality.

The report also alleged about Hiten Chandulal Timbadia, a partner of auditing firm Valia & Timbadia, involvement in a stock rigging case.

The brokerage firm sought clarification on why little-known London-based firm Jermyn Capital was selected to manage Sun Pharma's $275 million foreign convertible bond issue back in 2004-07. The note was shared through WhatsApp on November 27, following which the stock fell three percent on November 28, 2018.

The note enquired about the role of Lakshadeep Investments, a firm where Valia is a shareholder. The auditor of Lakshadeep is Valia's CA firm, Sudhir Valia & Associates, which Macquarie deems a huge conflict of interest.

The brokerage firm has raised many red flags on the pharmaceutical company over the years. ""Most of these the street has already picked up on, including a sole distributor for Sun Pharma that is wholly-owned by the promoter, its conspicuously low tax rate, and guarantees made by the company to a number of entities,"" the note read.

Regarding Jermyn Capital, the note said its Indian arm was found to have links with Parekh and Doshi, traders guilty of rigging share prices and causing a market crash in 2002.

Valia's Investment Trust of India, previously named Fortune Financial, lists Orange Mauritius as a shareholder. The latter is an FII sub-account of First International Group, which allegedly links to Doshi and Jermyn Capital.

Sun Pharma has denied the allegations and said it has never done anything against the interests of minority shareholders."

Moneycontrol News

Sun Pharma, India’s largest drug maker that has invested around $1 billion in the specialty business in the US, has so far found it to be a mixed bag due to competition, higher marketing and distribution expenses and gradual off-take in prescriptions of its products.

""We committed close to a $1 billion on specialty business; we have to justify that investment and produce returns,"" said Dilip Shanghvi in the company's earnings call on February 12.

Sun Pharma which built its speciality business through a series of acquisitions over the years, however, pressed the pause button in FY18.

Shanghvi said the uncertainty related to the reimbursement and pricing of assets made them circumspect.

""I don’ think the valuation totally reflect the underlying value of the product in the market,"" Shanghvi said.

Sun Pharma has the largest pipeline of specialty drugs among Indian companies in the US, largely built on acquisitions and in-licensing products developed by promoter held Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company (SPARC). The company is focusing on eye care and skin as target therapeutic areas for specialty play.

The company launched two assets -- Bromsite to treat eye pain and Odomzo to treat skin cancer during FY18. Sun Pharma bought Odomzo, from Novartis paying $175 million.

In the current financial year, it had launched three specialty products Yonsa, Ilumya (IL-23) and Xelpros.

The company bought prostrate-cancer drug Yonsa from Churchill Pharmaceuticals, Ilumya or Tildrakizumab from Merck in 2014 for $80 million and Xelpros was in-licensed from SPARC,

It's top-selling specialty drug Absorica used in the treatment of the skin condition called acne, was through Ranbaxy acquisition.

Sun Pharma said the launch of the much-anticipated Cequa, is now pushed to first quarter of FY20 due to some manufacturing delays. Cequa is used in the treatment of eye infections

The management also said it has decided against the launch of Elepsia as it doesn’t see commercial merit in building a CNS (central nervous system) field force for a single product.

The product will now be returned to SPARC.

While Sun Pharma doesn't provide a break-up of its specialty business revenues, analysts estimate the sales to be around 20 percent of the company's overall US sales. Sun Pharma's US sales in FY18 was around Rs 8,746.6 crore.

Kotak Securities estimates the sales of the specialty business to be Rs 4,113.8 crore or about one-third of Sun Pharma's US sales by FY21.

Challenges galore

Faced with competition and commodification of generic drugs in the US, Indian drug makers such as Sun Pharma have been gradually diversifying into specialty drugs.

Specialty drugs are medications that provide targeted therapy for severe, chronic and rare diseases, and are often built on incremental innovation like new delivery formulations such as patches, inhalers, topicals etc., or new disease indications or better safety profile, so they get some protection by patents and are also complex to copy, ensuring drug makers limited competition, and much better margins.

But unlike generic drugs, specialty requires a lot of investment on development and commercialisation, and the payoffs hinge on a lot of factors.

Companies have to invest significant time and money on clinical development, regulatory filings, brand building, front-end distribution, ensuring coverage of payers, raising sales force to motivate doctors to write more prescriptions. Since specialty drugs are not breakthrough innovations there is always a sword of a copy hanging.

This is somewhat uncharted territory for Indian drug markers in the US.

For instance, Sun Pharma's is competing against well-entrenched rivals Novartis, Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson to gain market share of Ilumya. The three competitors also sell broadly the same class of biologic drugs like Ilumya, meant for the same disease segment.

Sun Pharma's Ilumya has so far been prescribed by 800 doctors at least once. Though its early days, Sun Pharma stays optimistic.

The case isn't any different for its other speciality drug Odomzo, where it is competing against Roche's Erivedge. Other speciality drugs like Absorica and BromSite are also not immune to generic competition.

""There is learning involved, it is a new market, completely different from what we at Sun (Pharma) had done,"" said Abhay Gandhi, CEO of North America business for Sun Pharma.

""If we didn't have confidence, we wouldn’t have invested that kind of money in creating a new business. Now that we are there, we have no options but find ways to succeed in that market. We will learn, we will make some mistakes, and we will try and get a fair share of the market,"" Gandhi added.

Meanwhile, Sun Pharma has guided further increase in Selling, General & Administrative Expense (SG&A) given the promotional spend on Ilumya and Cequa and higher R&D spend in FY2020 to fund new indication trials for Ilumya."

Motilal Oswal's research report on Sun Pharma

Sun Pharma's (SUNP) revenue grew ~16% YoY to INR76.6b (our estimate: INR77.3b) in 3QFY19, led by higher Taro and API sales. Gross margin (GM) expanded ~350bp YoY (-260bp QoQ) to 71.7%, led by better revenue growth and an improved product mix. EBITDA margin, too, expanded by 210bp YoY to 23.1% owing to GM expansion and lower employee cost (-206bp YoY as % of sales), partly offset by higher other expenses (+190bp YoY). Revenue growth, coupled with a better operating margin, led to adj. PAT of INR9.4b (our estimate: INR10.2b). For 9MFY19, sales/EBITDA/adj. PAT increased 12%/26%/26% YoY to INR216b/INR47.3b/INR29b.

Outlook

We cut our FY19/20/21 EPS estimates by 4.5%/5.4%/4% to factor in subdued growth in the domestic formulation business and the delayed pick-up in the US business. We roll to 22x (unchanged) 12M forward earnings and arrive at a target price of INR540 (prior: INR560).

Most global brokerage firms have maintained buy recommendation on Sun Pharma after India’s largest drugmaker said its net profit jumped 286.1 percent to Rs 1,241.1 crore in the third quarter ended December 2018.

The reported numbers were higher than analyst estimates by a wide margin helped by a strong recovery of US generics business. The company posted a net profit of Rs 321.5 crore during the previous year’s period.

Reacting to the results, Sun Pharma jumped 3 percent in morning trade on Wednesday.

Global brokerage firms have a target price in the range of Rs 535-560 on Sun Pharma which translates into an upside of 22-28 percent return in the next 12 months.

Revenues from operations gained 17 percent to Rs 7,933.25 crore compared to a year ago's Rs 6,782.42 crore. The EBITDA margin of the company stood at 27.8 percent.

CLSA which marinated its buy rating on Sun Pharma post Q3 results recommends a target price of Rs 560. The December quarter results were good even after adjustments.

The specialty pipeline execution will be the key focus area for FY20. The US sales grew by 8 percent on a QoQ basis to USD 370 million, led by market-share gains in generic products.

The response to novel psoriasis drug Ilumya has been good, and CEQUA launch has been delayed a bit to Q1FY20, highlighted the CLSA report.

The execution will be the key in FY20. The valuations are fairly attractive and going forward specialty portfolio ramp-up could drive a rerating, added the report.

Sales in the US were $362 million for the quarter, a growth of 10 percent over the same period last year and accounted for 34 percent of total sales.

Sun Pharma in the US has 441 ANDAs approved, while filings for 564 ANDAs await US FDA nod, including 15 tentative approvals. For the quarter, 5 ANDAs were filed and 10 approvals were received.

Here’s what other global brokerage firms are recommending:

Jefferies: Buy| Target: Rs 535

Jefferies maintained its buy rating on Sun Pharma post December quarter results with a target price of Rs 535. The pharma major reported better-than-expected Q3 results, led by a margin beat.

The US revenue was below our expectation but EM/ROW surprised positively, said the note. The CQUEA launch has been delayed to Q1FY20, and the Ilumya is tracking well. The corporate governance concerns could remain a near-term overhang.

From the investors’ perspective, the risk-to-reward ratio is favorable as the underlying business is improving.

Citi: Buy| Target: Rs 540

Citigroup maintained its buy rating on Sun Pharma post Q3 results with a target price of Rs 540. The management commentary was optimistic, and hinted at better disclosures going forward.

The lingering concerns on generics business are fading, and going forward specialty progress would be key to stock performance.

We have collated a list of recommendations from global brokerage firms for Wednesday, January 23.

Asian Paints: Upgraded to Outperform | Raised target to Rs 1580

Macquarie upgraded Asian Paints to outperform rating post December quarter results and also raised its 12-month target price to Rs 1,580 from Rs 1,180 earlier.

Volume growth has picked up significantly and the volume growth outlook has also improved, which is a positive sign.

The recent price hikes with falling input costs will improve margins, said the Macquarie note. The global investment bank also raised FY19-21 EPS estimates by 7-16 percent. The full effect of lower GST rates yet to play out, added the note.

TVS Motor Company: Sell| Target: Rs 360

CLSA maintained its sell rating on TVS Motor Company post-December quarter results with a target price of Rs 360. The company displayed good growth in December quarter but was largely in line with estimates.

Two-wheeler demand remains a big concern. TVS growth numbers were better in scooter/premium-bikes while on the other hand mopeds was a drag. Margin expansion unlikely amidst regulatory cost push and high competition, the note added.

Havells India: Outperform| Hike target to Rs 775

CLSA maintained its outperform rating on Havells India post Q3 results but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 775 from Rs 720 earlier.

The revenue growth surprises were visible across categories. The input costs impact consumer durables and Lloyd’s margins. Large channel inventory in the AC industry remains a concern, said the report.

Shree Cement: Outperform| Target: Rs 19050

Macquarie maintained its outperform rating on Shree Cement post Q3 results with a target price of Rs 19,050. Strong volumes have offset cost headwinds.

Cost deflation is likely to benefit from March Quarter, while price hike can drive upgrades. The capacity growth is likely to drive market-share gain in the next two financial years.

HDFC Life: Buy| Cut target to Rs 475

CLSA maintained its buy rating on HDFC Life but slashed its 12-month target price to Rs 475 from Rs 510 earlier.

The company recorded steady premium growth but with weaker persistency and margins. Steady credit protects business aids growth and profitability. Lower growth and margin forecasts are likely to drive 4-9 percent cuts to VNB forecasts for FY20-21.

Sun Pharma: Buy| Target: Rs 560

CLSA marinated its buy rating on Sun Pharma with a target price of Rs 560. Steps taken by the company to address governance issues is largely positive.

The outcome of whistle-blower complaint to SEBI will remain an overhang along with the outcome of DoJ investigation on price increases in the US. Valuation is fairly attractive given improving business fundamentals.

Moneycontrol News

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, India's largest drug maker which is facing investor ire for certain corporate governance practices, on January 22 announced major steps to undo the damage, including discontinuation of super stockist arrangement with related party Aditya Medisales (AML) and unwinding loans given to a third party.

The management said it had initiated steps to induct SRBC & Co, its statutory auditors, as auditors of subsidiaries that are currently audited by Valia & Timbadia, another sore point for investors.

In a filing with the stock exchanges, the company said distribution related to its domestic formulations business will transition from AML, the current distributor, to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Pharma.

""This change will be effective by Q1 FY20, after receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals,"" the statement to the exchanges said.

Sun Pharma also denied granting any loans or guarantees to Suraksha Realty, a firm controlled by Sun Pharma’s co-promoter Sudhir Valia. ""Sun Pharma would like to dispel all falsehoods being spread about its financial dealings with Suraksha Realty. The company states unequivocally that it does not have any financial transactions with Suraksha Realty,"" it stated.

In response to another investor concern, Sun Pharma said its domestic formulation business is entirely routed through a promoter-owned entity called AML, a super stockist that was declared as a related party of the company only during FY18.

In an analyst call in December 2018, the management said the arrangement with AML was made for an efficient tax structure and it is ready to review the same if investors aren't comfortable. AML had revenues of Rs 8,000 crore in FY18.

Moneycontrol had reported on January 21 about Sun Pharma discontinuing its AML arrangement.

The stock of the pharma major took a hit last week, dropping 12 percent in intraday trading on January 18 on reports of a whistle-blower complaint to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) alleging transactions over Rs 5,800 crore between AML and Suraksha Realty, out of the money generated from the publicly-listed company.

Moneycontrol was unable to independently review the whistle-blower complaint. The report alleged the Sun Pharma's payment to Aditya Medisales was transferred to the promoter and group companies between 2014 and 2017.

Unwinding loansThe company said it will be unwinding a loan transaction of Rs 2,238 crore with a third-party called Atlas Global Trading. The company's FY18 annual report doesn't mention the name of Atlas Global Trading.

""This liability was in respect of Atlas assuming the damages on account of the Protonix patent litigation settlement entered into by Sun Pharma, which was disclosed by us in our FY14 Annual Report,"" the company said. It agreed to pay $500 million to Pfizer in 2013 after losing the patent battle over the latter's acid reflex drug Protonix. In 2008, the company launched the drug at risk, which means that the certain patents of the drugs are still alive.

""In September 2014, Sun Pharma’s Halol facility (Gujarat) was impacted by USFDA cGMP issues which were finally resolved after nearly four years in June 2018. These cGMP non-compliances resulted in supply constraints and Sun Pharma was not able to adhere to the agreed supply schedule with Atlas. Sun Pharma, in FY18, has funded Atlas towards non-fulfilment of its supply obligations till the time such obligations are fulfilled as per the agreement. The said funding was included in loans and advances schedule of Sun Pharma’s FY18 consolidated balance sheet,"" it said.

""The parties to the supply contract have now agreed in principle, that Atlas will assign its rights and obligations arising from this contract, to a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Pharma. This assignment will ensure that the loans and advances given to Atlas will be settled. On conclusion of this transaction, in the consolidated balance sheet, this loan and obligation will cease to exist as it gets squared up,"" the pharma major added.

This transaction is expected to be concluded in FY19.

According to an old Credit Suisse report, Atlas is a group company of SuGandh Group. Another company from the SuGandh Group, SuGandh Management Consultancy, was a related party of Sun Pharma, an enterprise under significant influence of key management personnel or their relatives till February 28, 2013."

Shares of Sun Pharma soared in trade after multiple sessions of weak trades. Investors are likely to have bet on the stock due to possible bottoming out of prices as well as reports of some action by the company on Aditya Medisales.

India’s largest drugmaker is likely contemplating discontinuing the super stockist arrangement with Aditya Medisales (AML), sources told Moneycontrol.

“They are doing away with AML as super stockiest,” said a person with knowledge about the matter on condition of anonymity.

“They are internally debating whether to take it (AML) inside the company, or give it to some third party, depending upon where they can save the money,” the source said.

A spokesperson of Sun Pharma told Moneycontrol the company is evaluating all the options.

Sun Pharma’s domestic formulation business is entirely routed through a promoter-owned entity called AML, a super stockist that was declared as a related party of the company only during FY18.

In an analyst call in December 2018, Sun Pharma said the arrangement with AML was made for an efficient tax structure and it is ready to review if investors aren't comfortable.

AML had revenues of Rs 8,000 crore in FY18.

Sun Pharma stock took a hit last week, with shares dropping 12 percent on intraday trading on December 18. This was on reports of a whistleblower complaint to Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) alleging transactions over Rs 5,800 crore between AML and Suraksha Realty, controlled by Sun Pharma’s co-promoter, Sudhir Valia out of the money generated from the publicly-listed company.

At 09:30 hrs Sun Pharmaceutical Industries was quoting at Rs 414.55, up Rs 16.20, or 4.07 percent."

“They are doing away with AML as super stockist,” said a person with knowledge about the matter on condition of anonymity.

“They are internally debating whether to take it (AML) inside the company, or give it to some third party, depending upon where they can save the money,” the source said.

A spokesperson of Sun Pharma told Moneycontrol the company is evaluating all the options.

Sun Pharma’s domestic formulation business is entirely routed through a promoter-owned entity called AML, a super stockist that was declared as a related party of the company only during FY18.

In an analyst call in December 2018, Sun Pharma said the arrangement with AML was made for an efficient tax structure and it is ready to review if investors aren't comfortable.

AML had revenues of Rs 8,000 crore in FY18.

Sun Pharma stock took a hit last week, with shares dropping 12 percent on intraday trading on December 18. This was on reports of a whistleblower complaint to Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) alleging transactions over Rs 5,800 crore between AML and Suraksha Realty, controlled by Sun Pharma’s co-promoter, Sudhir Valia out of the money generated from the publicly-listed company.

Moneycontrol was unable to independently review the whistleblower complaint.

The report alleged Sun Pharma's payment to Aditya Medisales was transferred to the promoter and group companies between 2014 and 2017.

Later, Sun Pharma in a clarification to stock exchanges said it hasn’t received the alleged 172‐page whistleblower complaint and therefore, is not privy to the contents of the document.

The company requested SEBI to examine the matter in its entirety and the role of some media houses and other stakeholders.

Reputation on the line

Analysts and corporate governance experts Moneycontrol spoke to said it’s time for the SEBI to verify the veracity of the allegations made by the whistleblower in the complaint.

The analysts also felt the response from Sun Pharma so far hasn’t been adequate.

“To tell the investors, that if you don’t like the structure we will reverse, it is for my mind is not an optimal solution,” said an executive of proxy advisory firm that advises shareholders.

“You can’t be reacting, you have to kind of decide what fits in business requirement. If it is a tax efficient structure for you, you have to tell the investors that this why it is a tax efficient structure,” the executive said.

""We don't know the veracity of the (whistleblower) allegations, but for sure the company has not addressed it in a forceful and compelling manner,"" said Shriram Subramanian, Founder & MD, InGovern Research.

""The December investor call by Sun Pharma was an opportunity for the management to put all the allegations to rest. They said we will look at not using AML in future. We will look at the Rs 2000 crore loans that we have given to non-related parties if it is in the interest of the shareholders, but somehow the management commentary wasn't convincing,"" Subramanian added.

Subramanian also urged SEBI to act fast and the company to be proactive in the interest of shareholders.

JN Gupta, Founder and Managing Director of Stakeholders Empowerment Services and form SEBI executive director also sought SEBI's action in the case.

""The issue is what are the contents of the whistleblower letter, and whether they are true or not, first this has to be established only after SEBI investigation,"" said

""Now if they are true, then the action whether it is corrective, preventive or penal action lies with Sun Pharma, if they are incorrect, then the action must be taken against the whistleblower,"" Gupta added."

Sun Pharma has had a roller-coster ride for past some time. The stock fell about 14% during January 17-18, and nearly 40 percent since October.

High valuations, corporate governance issues as well as product recall in the US have posed as headwinds for the company. The pharma major hit a fresh 52-week low on Friday and chances are that it may even slide further.

December quarter data suggests that the value of Sun Pharma holding with fund managers declined by nearly 20 percent, Morningstar India data showed.

The recent issue which led to a sudden fall in Sun Pharma stock price was a Moneylife report alleging fresh whistle-blower compliant made to market regulator, Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Also, a recent report suggested that Sun Pharmaceutical Industries is voluntarily recalling 13,918 cartons and 1,39,180 vials of Vecuronium Bromide for injection, used as part of general anesthesia, due to the presence of a particulate unwanted matter.

The stock has corrected from Rs 634 on October 1, 2018 to Rs 390.75 on January 18, 2019. It has been in a downtrend for some time now without any meaningful recovery. But, does this fall make it a ‘contra buy’?

Well, most technical experts feel that it is better to avoid catching the falling knife at current levels as the stock is in continuation of a downtrend and technically, there is no evidence of near-term bottom formation.

Historical price behaviour of Sun Pharma is suggesting that it had the worst phase during the year 2000 when it topped out at Rs 25 only to hit a bottom at Rs 7 with a deep cut of 72 percent. Time-wise it took 13 quarters to consolidate and initiate a fresh bull run.

“The current phase is pretty much looking similar to what it did way back in the year 2000. Right now, this counter is in a strong bear grip after hitting a major top around 1200 in April 2015,” Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol.

“Since 2018 this counter appears to have resumed its down move from the highs of 678 as it breached the critical support of 435 recently and Friday’s price damage registered a new swing low of 375. Hence, around these levels there doesn’t look like any contra buying opportunity unless it swiftly recovers and stabilises above 435, as it breached all critical supports and heading lower,” he said.

Mohammad further added that if 375 is breached, we will not be surprised to see this stock heading to much lower levels with a target of Rs 316. For the time-being, it looks prudent to avoid this stock.

The stock is clearly in a downtrend. It closed 6.9 percent lower in October, followed by 15 percent cut in November, another 12 percent fall in December, and so far in the month of January 2019, the stock is down by about 7 percent.

The index is finding selling pressure at higher levels. Last month, it consolidated at its long-term support zone in the range of Rs 400–420 and witnessed a modest recovery. However, the said recovery was short-lived as in the last two sessions we have seen a sharp plunge on downside breaking the mention support zone with ease.

""The stock is now in continuation of a downtrend and technically there is no evidence of near term bottom formation in the stock. As far as levels are concerned, previous support zone in range of Rs 400–420 can now act as a hurdle on any bounce back,” Rajesh Bhosle, Technical Analyst, Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.

“We generally say ‘avoid catching the falling Knife’; we would recommend investors avoiding hunting for the bottom in this stock and instead, any bounce should be used to exit long positions. Investors can instead focus on outperforming stocks within the space, like Biocon, Divi’s Laboratories, which may provide better returns in the near-term,” he said.

Sun Pharma, India's largest drug maker's stock hit 52 week low on BSE, dropping below the resistance levels of Rs 400.

Corporate governance issues have once again unsettled the company. This time, it was a Moneylife report alleging fresh whistle-blower compliant made to market regulator the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

This too was filed by the same whistle-blower who had filed a complaint in September 2018, according to the report.

The latest whistle-blower complaint alleges large transactions between Aditya Medisales (AML) and Suraksha Realty, controlled by Sun Pharma’s co-promoter Sudhir Valia, out of the money generated from the publicly-listed company.

The whistle-blower complaint provides alleged statements of ICICI Bank and Yes Bank accounts that show transactions made between AML and Suraksha Realty. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

Sun Pharma’s domestic formulation business is entirely routed through a promoter-owned entity called AML, a super stockist.

AML was disclosed as related party of the company, only during FY18, while the arrangement had been in existence for years.

However, the transactions with AML were not reported as related-party because it was not required to be classified prior to FY18, the company said in December. It also said that AML had become a related party due to consolidation of Sun Pharma’s shareholding among fewer investment entities.

In an analyst call in December, the company had said the arrangement with AML was made for an efficient tax structure and it is ready to consider changing the structure of the deal.

In FY18 the revenues of AML were around Rs 8,000 crore.

""Lack of disclosures on certain related party transactions has been a concern,"" an analyst tracking pharma at a Mumbai-based brokerage house said on the condition of anonymity.

“These issues (raised by alleged the whistle-blower) may remain an overhang on the stock until more clarity emerges,” the analyst added.

While SEBI has acknowledged that it had received a whistle-blower complaint on Sun Pharma in December, it is yet to re-open the case.

Corporate governance experts such as JN Gupta, Co-founder & Managing Director of Stakeholders Empowerment Services and former Executive Director of SEBI, says it is time for the market regulator to verify the allegations made by the whistle-blower.

""The issue is that we do not know the truth. We only know what has been alleged. So it is a clear cut case where SEBI needs to get into details and if at all any wrong doing is found, it is punished as soon as possible and as high as possible,” Gupta told CNBC-TV18 on January 18."

Indian drug majors Lupin, Sun Pharma and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals are recalling various drugs from the US market for a variety of reasons. As per the latest Enforcement Report published by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), Lupin is voluntarily recalling 55,000 vials and 1,60,241 boxes of anti-bacterial drug Ceftriaxone for injection in various strengths.

The recall has been initiated by Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of the Mumbai-based firm. The products have been manufactured at the company's facility in Mandideep, Madhya Pradesh.

The company is recalling specific lots of drugs due to the presence of particulate matter.

""Product complaints received of grey flecks, identified as shredded rubber particulate matter from the stopper observed in reconstituted vials,"" USFDA said.

The ongoing voluntary nationwide recall has been classified as Class-I. Such recalls are for dangerous or defective products that predictably could cause serious health problems.

Lupin Pharmaceuticals is also recalling 2,87,784 bottles of Cefdinir for Oral Suspension, used to treat bacterial infections, for CGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice) deviations.

The USFDA has classified it as a Class-II recall, which is initiated in a ""situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote"".

Similarly, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries is voluntarily recalling 13,918 cartons and 1,39,180 vials of Vecuronium Bromide for Injection, used as part of general anesthesia, due to presence of particulate matter.

Besides, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals is recalling 96,240 applicators of its product Estradiol Vaginal Inserts for defective delivery system. The USFDA has termed it as a Class-II recall."

Sun Pharma, India’s largest drugmaker on January 18 told stock exchanges it hasn’t received the alleged 172‐page whistleblower complaint and therefore, is not privy to the contents of the document.

The company requested market regulator Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to examine the matter in its entirety and the role of some media houses and other stakeholders.

“There is a great asymmetry in the information circulating between analysts, investors and media leading to intense speculation. The availability of information contained in the whistleblower documents to a set of selective investors does put other investors including retail investors in a disadvantageous position,” Sun Pharma said in a statement.

“It is evident from the fact that shareholders value has been drastically eroded within a short span of time due to the unsubstantiated complaint or allegation against the company and mala fide campaign launched by certain media houses,” the statement alleged.

Sun Pharma’s stock took a beating on Friday falling 12 percent after a media report alleged fresh whistleblower compliant made to market regulator SEBI.

The whistleblower report alleged large transactions between Aditya Medisales (AML) and Suraksha Realty, controlled by Sun Pharma’s co-promoter, Sudhir Valia out of the money generated from the publicly-listed company.

Sun Pharma’s domestic formulation business is entirely routed through a promoter-owned entity called Aditya Medisales, a super stockiest that became a related party of the company during FY18 after a consolidation of several other investment companies.

Aditya Medisales does not enjoy any significant profitability, and on revenues of Rs 8,000 crore in FY18 it had an EBITDA margin of 1.7 percent and net margin of 0.4 percent in FY18.

In an analyst call, the company had said the arrangement was made for an efficient tax structure and it is ready to relook at the deal but might consider changing the structure of the deal.

Sun Pharma also said the voluntary recall of certain batches of Vecuronium Bromide Injection in the US market will not have any material impact on financials, as the product has a negligible contribution to company’s consolidated revenues.

Shares of Sun Pharmaceuticals plummeted over 8 percent as investors reacted to a fresh complaint by a whistleblower against the company.

The company lost a little over Rs 15,000 crore market capitalisation in the past two sessions.

According to Moneylife magazine, between 2014 and 2017, Aditya Medisales (AML) has had over Rs 5,800 crore of transactions with Suraksha Realty, controlled by Sun Pharma’s co-promoter, Sudhir Valia. This is as per a new 172-page complaint (with documents) sent by the whistleblower on Sun Pharma to the market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

The company has been battling corporate governance issues. In December 2018, the first complaint by whistleblower alleged that Dilip Shanghvi, his brother-in-law Sudhir Valia were part of financial irregularities with Dharmesh Doshi. Doshi was allegedly a key figure in Ketan Parekh scam of 2001.

The company was also in the news recently for a drug recall.

Its US subsidiary started voluntarily recalling 13,918 cartons of Vecuronium Bromide Injection of 10 mg and 20 mg strengths from US market at hospital level, following the identification of ""particulate matter identified as glass"" in the product.

The Vecuronium Bromide for Injection has been found to contain particulate matter identified as glass,"" Sun Pharma said in a letter to the US Food and Drug Administration on January 8.

The company, in a filing to exchanges, has clarified some aspects with regards to the complaint. The said whistleblower documents and other confidential emails are being offered for inspection to institutional investors by one media house as per the report, which again we are not privy to.

In these circumstances, there is a great asymmetry in the information circulating between analysts, investors and media leading to intense speculation. The availability of information contained in the whistleblower documents to a set of selective investors does put other investors including retail investors in a disadvantageous position.

We are concerned that certain entities/individuals are adopting unfair trade practices prejudicial to the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders. It is evident from the fact that shareholders value has been drastically eroded within a short span of time due to unsubstantiated complaint/allegation against the company and mala fide campaign launched by certain media houses, it added.

Global turmoil, volatility in the USD-INR coupled with state election verdict saw alternate bouts of buying and selling in December series. After five months of over 6 percent (+/-) average move, December series ended on a flat note.

The Nifty closed 0.66 percent down at 10,783 while Bank Nifty closed 0.13 percent lower at 26,887. The Nifty saw a rollover of 73.8 percent with over 13.6 percent of an incremental open interest at beginning of January series while BankNifty saw a lower roll of 63.6 percent with the shedding of 41 percent OI at beginning of January series.

During the week, the Nifty made a low of 10,536 but recovered swiftly to come near the vicinity of its vital highest Call strike of 11,000. The Bank Nifty too recovered ~1000 points from the low of 26,400 to 27,300.

The Volatility Index has moved above 15 indicating market can continue to witness swings in January series. Reduction in OI has been seen across stocks as traders are reluctant to carry leverage position.

Long built up was seen in consumer goods (HUL, Bata India) and NBFCs (Muthoot Finance, Repco Home). Short built-up was seen in Textile (SRF, Arvind) and Pharma (Sun Pharma, Auro Pharma).

Private Banks like (Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, and RBL Bank) saw positive price action but a lower carryover of position to next series.

The Nifty options data for the January series shows 10,500 as distant support. Congestion in between is too sparse to pay attention.

On the other hand, ~2.5 million shares in 11,000 Call & Put could make it difficult to run away beyond 11,000. Thus a low-risk hedge strategy Bear Put spread in Nifty could be deployed.

Bear Put Spread is a Bearish strategy where we buy 1 lot of ATM Put and sell 1 lot of lower strike Put. The maximum loss is limited to net premium outflow on the higher end. Profit is maximum to the difference in strike less the net outflow.

Despite Urjit Patel’s exit and setback for BJP in election results of three Hindi heartland states, Nifty5o closed in the green at 10,549.15 on Tuesday. But, the index has wiped out almost all the gains it made through the year. On December 29, 2017, the index had closed at 10,530.

During the same period, many NSE stocks fell 20-60% from their 52-week highs. As many as 22 Nifty stocks are a part of that list, which includes Tata Motors, Yes Bank, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Vedanta, Sun Pharma, IOC, Tata Steel and JSW Steel.

The loss of power in three states — Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chattisgarh — by BJP is a major event for investors to take note. Most experts feel that the journey from here on could turn volatile and the upside is likely to remain capped at 11,000 for Nifty.

Apart from political setback which could impact markets in the short term, the bigger worry will come from the global factors. In the US markets, more than half of S&P components are in a bear phase and most global investment banking firms are penciling a slower growth which could trigger a risk-off sentiment.

Foreign investors turned net sellers in December after pumping more than Rs 10,000 crore in Indian markets in November. A slow global growth environment will hurt growth for India Inc. as well which might not auger well for D-Street.

“Given, the present scenario where global economic growth is tapering, concerns on geo-political issues are on the rise, uncertain US trade policies, currency and crude oil volatility, inclusive corporate earnings growth trajectory yet to pick up; we expect 2019 to be no different from 2018, where markets may gyrate to extreme ends,” Dharmesh Kant, Head – Retail Research, IndiaNivesh Securities told Moneycontrol.

“Empirical evidence advocates bottom up approach for stock picking, which is the need of the hour. Companies that are driven by solid business models, asset-light balance sheet, high return ratios, and consistent earnings are the ones that would ride the storm,” he said.

Where investors should bet their money?

Investors will be better off not to touch high beta names until some clarity emerges with respect to General Elections 2019. But, till that time capital goods, IT, banking, agro are certain sectors which could hog the limelight.

""The Corporate banking space looks interesting, going ahead. The NPA cycle seems to have peaked out, the asset resolution bodes well, capex-cycle is slowly gathering pace, and the base for next year is very favourable. Apart from this, Pharmaceuticals and certain consumer-related stocks should do well,"" Prasanna Pathak, Fund Manager-Equity at Taurus Asset Management Co. Ltd. told Moneycontrol.

Kant feels that consumption space will outperform others, specifically FMCG, white goods, electrical & electronics, agro-chemicals, and select financials.

Sahil Kapoor, Chief Market Strategist, Edelweiss Investment Research, is of the view that pharma stocks could make a comeback in 2019 as current factors have led to extensive price damage.

The overhang of corporate governance issues faced by India's largest drug maker Sun Pharma may not go away soon as analysts tracking the company said they still haven’t got full clarity on Rs 2,242 crore loans advanced to employees and others, and the benefit of the arrangement with the promoter- owned Aditya Medisales.

Investors are also concerned about a potential investigation by the stock market regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on a complaint by a whistleblower. The company said it hasn’t received any communication from SEBI.

Sun Pharma has been trying to restore investor confidence, after a scathing note by Australian brokerage firm Macquarie and a whistleblower complaint to SEBI last week. The drug maker's stock has since dropped to one-fifth of its value.

Shares of Sun Pharma on December 5 dropped 6.59 percent to close at Rs 413.60 on BSE, the benchmark Sensex declined 0.69 percent to end 35,884.41 points.

The company held an investor call on Monday late evening to assuage concerns over recent reports of governance lapses at the company. Dilip Shanghvi, Sun Pharma’s Managing Director tried to give a point-by-point rebuttal and said his company is ready to simplify structures and do away with certain transactions.

But analysts have found something amiss on at least two things

Third-party loans and advances

In FY18, loans given by Sun Pharma rose to Rs 2,242 crore, compared to Rs 69.8 crore a year ago to employees and others. The company said this was a structured transaction, related to the pharmaceutical business. But it did not share crucial details like the eventual beneficiary of the loan, citing business sensitivity.

But the company said the loan is for pharma business and can take 2-2.5 years to come back, with interest rate ranging from 0 to 15 percent, depending on certain outcomes. The company added it can unwind this transaction earlier than planned if required.

But it raised more questions.

“Given the recent $200 million modafinil settlement and $250 million speciality product-related milestones in 1HFY19, Sun Pharma was forced to ask Taro for $500 million special dividends to strengthen its ex-Taro balance sheet. This further weakens the rationale for furthering such a large loan to a third party. Moreover, does it indicate that Sun Pharma no longer has investment avenues to earn 15 percent IRR on pharma /speciality projects?,” Kotak Securities said in a report.

Modafinil antitrust settlement relates to so-called “pay-for-delay” settlements in which brand-name drug makers pay their generic counterparts to keep drugs off the market.

The analysts were also spooked by lack of disclosures around the number of parties receiving the loan, or the average quantum of loans given.

Related party transactions

Sun Pharma’s domestic formulation business is entirely routed through a promoter-owned entity called Aditya Medisales, a super stockiest that became a related party of the company during FY18 after a consolidation of several other investment companies.

Aditya Medisales does not enjoy any significant profitability, and on revenues of Rs 8,000 crore, it had an EBITDA margin of 1.7 percent and net margin of 0.4 percent in FY18. Shanghvi said the arrangement was made for an efficient tax structure and said he is ready to relook at the deal and might look at changing the structure of the deal.

The Aditya Medisales arrangement for tax-efficiency has become irrelevant with the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) last year.

What are analysts saying

“The company provided limited clarity on the structure of its domestic C&F agent (Aditya Medisales), US$340m of incremental loans advanced to employees/others and the whistle-blower complaint filed against the company. Based on investor feedback, management may look at rewinding/reorganising some transactions that the company believes will not have any material impact on its operations,” said IIFL in its report.

“We believe these issues may remain an overhang on the valuations until more clarity emerges,” ICICI Securities said."

Share price of pharma major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries plunged 10 percent in the early trade on December 3 after news reports of SEBI likely to reopen the investigation into the insider trading case against the company and its promoters.

A PTI report, quoting sources, said SEBI plans to reopen the investigation into the insider trading case against the company and its promoters that was settled through the consent mechanism.

Macquarie in its note raised several questions about corporate governance practices by the company. The note points to alleged connections with tainted entities like Ketan Parekh and Dharmesh Doshi, and the conflict of interest with regards to Sudhir Valia, a whole-time director of Sun Pharma and also the brother-in-law of promoter Dilip Shanghvi.

The note talks about real estate guarantees given to Suraksha Realty, apart from seeking clarification as to why a little known London-based firm Jermyn Capital was selected to manage Sun Pharma's $275 million foreign convertible bond issue back in 2004-07.

Jermyn's Indian arm allegedly has links with Parekh and Doshi, two traders who have come under scrutiny for the market crash of 2002.

Responding to the note, Sun Pharma said the information quoted in the note is available in public domain and is 10-15 years old. The management said it complies with corporate governance laws of the country.

Moneylife on November 30 reported that a whistle-blower had complained to market regulator SEBI alleging numerous irregularities against Sun Pharma, its main promoter Dilip Shanghvi and Sudhir Valia. Most of them were repetition of the points mentioned in the Macquarie note.

In addition, the whistle-blower alleged that during the Ranbaxy acquisition, the promoters may have gained as much as Rs 8,000 crore through insider trading.

Sun Pharma, along with its Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi, and nine others had settled the insider trading probe, paying Rs 18 lakh against the settlement charges in 2017.

Research house UBS has maintained buy call on Sun Pharma with a target of Rs 690 per share.

According to UBS, the whistle-blower allegations are valuation dampener at the minimum. This negatively impacts management's bandwidth at a time when key brands are getting launched.

It expects the stock to react negatively to the whistle-blower allegations.

The company will conduct a call at 06.30 pm IST on December 3 where senior management will update Investors.

Last week, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries was among the worst performing stocks. Shares of India's largest drug maker dropped around 6.46 percent in the last five trading days. The stock recovered on November 30 from the lows of almost 10 percent at one time.

What led to the fall?The week gone by started with Sun Pharma announcing it had entered into settlements with certain plaintiffs in the Modafinil antitrust litigation pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The company didn’t reveal terms of the settlement.

In Q2 FY19, the company had reported a surprise net loss of Rs 219 crore due to a one-time loss of Rs 1,214.38 crore with respect to the Modafinil antitrust litigation. In August last year, it paid Rs 950 crore in settlements relating to Modafinil, which is used to treat excessive sleep disorders.

It is still not clear whether this will be the last ever settlement.

But the real issue is a note circulated by Australian brokerage house Macquarie, which raised several questions about corporate governance practices by the company. The note points to alleged connections with tainted entities like Ketan Parekh and Dharmesh Doshi, and the conflict of interest with regards to Sudhir Valia, a whole-time director of Sun Pharma and also the brother-in-law of promoter Dilip Shanghvi.

The note talks about real estate guarantees given to Suraksha Realty, apart from seeking clarification as to why a little known London-based firm Jermyn Capital was selected to manage Sun Pharma's $275 million foreign convertible bond issue back in 2004-07.

Brokerage firm Macquarie questioned corporate governance practices in Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, causing the drugmaker's shares to end at a six-month low on November 29, The Economic Times reported.

The report quoted a Macquarie sales note by a trader on the company raised concerns over inadequate disclosures about the company's links with banned traders Ketan Parekh and Dharmesh Doshi, related transactions, and role of promoter Dilip Shanghvi's brother-in-law Sudhir Valia, who is a Director in Sun Pharma. There were also questions about real estate guarantees given to Suraksha Reality.

The brokerage firm sought clarification on why little-known London-based firm Jermyn Capital was selected to manage Sun Pharma's $275 million foreign convertible bond issue back in 2004-07.

The note was shared through WhatsApp on November 27, following which the Sun Pharma stock fell 3 percent on November 28.

The company has firmly denied all the charges. ""We understand that someone has compiled and circulated this information about Sun Pharma. The information, already available in the public domain, has been portrayed in a way to indicate that something inappropriate has been done by the company. We believe that we are in compliance with all provisions applicable to us,"" it said in a statement.

A spokesperson of the drugmaker also said that some of the information in the note is 10-15 years old.

After these developments, some FIIs may not be interested to invest in the company, a portfolio manager at a financial services firm was quoted as saying. He added that the stock will only react if some big FIIs dump the stock.

The note has inquired about the role of Lakshadeep Investments, a firm where Sudhir Valia is a shareholder. Macquarie has qualms about the fact that the entity is not listed as a promoter even though Valia reportedly has control over Sun.

The auditor of Lakshadeep is Valia's CA firm, Sudhir Valia & Associates, which Macquarie deems a huge conflict of interest.

The brokerage firm has observed many red flags in the pharmaceutical company over the years. ""Most of these the street has already picked up on, including a sole distributor for Sun Pharma that is wholly owned by the promoter, its conspicuously low tax rate, and guarantees made by the company to a number of entities,"" the note read.

Regarding Jermyn Capital, the note said its Indian arm was found to have links with Ketan Parekh and Dharmesh Doshi, traders guilty of rigging share prices and causing a market crash in 2002.

Sudhir Valia's Investment Trust of India, previously named Fortune Financial, lists Orange Mauritius as a shareholder. The latter is an FII sub-account of First International Group, which allegedly links to Doshi and Jermyn Capital."

Healthcare majors Sun Pharma, Aurobindo Pharma and Cadila Healthcare are expected to be benefitted from the likely production slowdown at Mylan's US facility after warning letter, Motilal Oswal said.

The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning letter to Mylan's flagship facility at Morgantown, US, which produces sizable oral solids portfolio for the US market.

The USFDA inspected Mylan's formulation facility at Morgantown, USA, during March 19-April 12, 2018, and issued Form 483 with 13 observations. Post inspection, the USFDA issued a warning letter likely due to inadequate response to the observations.

According to the warning letter, there is a lack of sufficient interim plan/comprehensive retrospective evaluation of investigations to ensure implementation of appropriate corrective and preventive action (CAPA).

The warning letter cited significant violations of the good manufacturing practices (GMP) for finished products.

Motilal Oswal said its analysis indicated that Mylan manufactures around 300 oral solids dosages at this site, making it the largest oral solids facility of Mylan.

""Issuance of Form 483 and the warning letter does not impose stoppage of production at the site, however, given the intensity of the issue, the huge product base and complexity of manufacturing, there could be a slowdown in production due to the implementation of remediation measures to resolve regulatory issues,"" it added.

According to the research firm, the slowdown in production at Morgantown site could provide a window of opportunity to Mylan's peers.

After analysing competitive dynamics of around 300 products manufactured at this site, Motilal Oswal concluded that there could be meaningful prospects for three pharma companies. ""There could be a probable benefit of $79 million to Sun Pharma, $40 million to Aurobindo Pharma and $35 million to Cadila Healthcare.""

The benefit is subject to (a) non-filing for an alternate site by Mylan, and (b) capacity available with Sun Pharma, Aurobindo and Cadila Healthcare to supply for any unplanned opportunities, the research house said.

Motilal Oswal remained selectively positive on companies with (a) a healthy generic product pipeline, (b) readiness to transform towards specialty/differentiated portfolio and (c) consistency to meet regulatory compliance. Its top pick is Aurobindo Pharma."

The September quarter results from India Inc. failed to generate enthusiasm among the investor community. The earnings, being a mixed bag, led to sharp cuts in individual stocks, while for benchmark indices, the cut was a little over 3 percent since September 28.

The S&P BSE Sensex lost over 1,200 points while for the Nifty the cut was a little over 400 points, or 3.7 percent, since September 28.

Most of the Nifty50 companies announced strong sales growth, but margin pressure was evident for the broader universe, especially in auto, energy and telecom universe, and earnings breadth seemed to be deteriorating.

Experts feel that there is a possibility that we might have started the journey of achieving higher earnings growth in the rest of FY19 as some of the headwinds which we saw in previous quarters are fading away.

“Going forward, with worst of the asset quality concerns behind us in the banking space, pick up in industrial activity as well as robust consumer sentiment, we expect Nifty earnings to stage an impressive CAGR of 18.5% over FY18-20E,” Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICIdirect.com told Moneycontrol.

“We assign a P/E multiple of 19.0x to FY20E Nifty EPS of Rs 636, and arrive at a Nifty target of 12,100,” he said.

Nifty target of 12,100 would translate into an upside of about 10% from current levels.

Among Nifty50 companies, 13 stocks saw an earnings beat, while 20 stocks saw an earnings miss. The beat ratio (net earnings surprise divided by the total number of stocks) deteriorated from –2% to -14%, largely due to downgrades in auto and financials, Elara Capital said in a report.

The brokerage firm also downgraded Nifty 50 EPS for FY19 to 532(4.9%) and FY20 to 658 (4.6%) from the last quarter, primarily due to consumer discretionary, healthcare and NBFC.

Elara Capital also lists out 15 stocks which saw EPS downgrades in last four quarters. The list include names like Grasim Industries, Lupin, NTPC, Power Finance Corporation, PNB, Sun Pharma, Bharti Airtel, Cipla, Bank of Baroda, Federal Bank, and Tata Motors.

However, experts advise investors not to see downgrades in isolation and use other parameters to make a buy or sell call. While there could be some upside left for benchmark indices, the stock specific movement will continue.

“Investors should not look at downgrades in isolation, they should look at valuations like PE, PEG, EV/EBITDA etc and also take a call on macros like crude, currency, GDP, etc.,” Atish Matlawala, Sr Analyst, SSJ Finance & Securities told Moneycontrol.

“We believe Q2FY19 result on overall basis were below expectations mainly because of crude and currency. We expect both of these to stabilize at lower levels in next few months and earning momentum to gather pace,” he said.

Data suggests that within the S&P BSE200 index, 29 percent of the companies saw an earnings upgrade for FY19 while 68 percent saw an earnings downgrade. But, Nifty has seen a steady rise despite muted earnings growth in the last 5-6 years.

For the September quarter, earnings upgrades were mainly seen in IT and Pharma, helped by the rupee depreciation, while major downgrades were in Auto, Telecom, Cement and select Financials.

“Since the beginning of FY19, the 1-year rolled forward EPS for the NIFTY50 has moved up by a mere 2 percent due to earnings downgrade. Despite weak earnings growth for the past six years (5% CAGR), the NIFTY50 index has risen at a CAGR of 13 percent due to expanding valuation multiples for stocks,” ICICI Securities said in a note.

“However, over the past one year, the environment for rising equity valuations is deteriorating with global liquidity getting tighter, higher bond yields, macro headwinds, and prospects of slowing global growth from FY20 onwards,” it said.

The brokerage firm expects incremental downgrades to our base NIFTY50 earnings estimate thereby resulting in a CAGR of 15.5 percent during FY19-21 and cut our target multiple to 17.1x (+ 0.4 s.d.) to arrive at our Dec’19 target of 11,800."

Motilal Oswal's research report on Sun Pharma

Domestic formulation sales disappoint: 2QFY19 revenue grew moderately by ~4% YoY to INR68.5b (our estimate: INR75.5b). The miss in revenue is primarily attributable to de-growth in domestic business (~28% of sales) on the back of one-time inventory reduction in supply chain. US business (~36% of sales) grew by a healthy ~11% YoY in constant currency. Gross margin improved by ~280bp YoY (+380bp QoQ) to 74.3%, largely due to lower COGS for Taro and write-back of certain provisions taken earlier. EBITDA margin expanded by ~110bp YoY (-30bp QoQ) to 21%. SUNP reported a loss of INR2.2b during the quarter due to one-time provision of INR12.1b related to the Modafinil anti-trust litigation. Adjusted for this, PAT was up ~9% YoY to INR9.9b (our estimate: INR10.9b). For 1HFY19, sales/EBITDA/PAT increased 10%/27%/38% YoY to INR141.6b/INR31.4b/INR19.8b.

Outlook

We remain positive on SUNP, considering likely ramp-up of specialty products, increased approvals from Halol, and good potential in domestic formulation. Maintain Buy.

HDFC Securities' research report on Sun Pharma

With the provision for Modafinil litigation liability to the tune of Rs 12bn, Sun Pharma (SUNP) reported a loss of Rs 2.2bn in 2QFY19. However, adjusted PAT at Rs 9.96bn was still 8% below our estimates due to a similar miss on top line. The inventory correction exercise resulted into a 16% fall in India revenues, along with slower than expected growth in the US (up 21%YoY) which led to 4%YoY revenue growth in 2QFY19 (8% miss). However, EBITDA margin remained flat QoQ at 22.1% as better product mix and favorable currency boosted gross margin to 74% despite a spike in other expenses on account of the specialty business.

Outlook

At CMP the stock is trading at 33.6x FY19E and 25.4x FY20E EPS, a ~15% premium to peers. With a significant part of revenues expected to come in from the branded business in 3-4 years, we believe the stock is likely to continue trading at a premium. An 8% miss on top line has led us to cut our estimates by ~3% for FY19-20E. Maintain BUY rating with a TP of Rs 670 (25x Sep’20E + Rs 40/sh option value for specialty).

Sun Pharmaceuticals reported a net loss of Rs 218 crore for the September quarter on the back of one-time loss of Rs 1,214.38 crore. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 912.12 crore during the corresponding quarter of last year.

The revenue stood at Rs 6,937.63 crore for quarter under review, up from Rs 6,650.34 crore reported during last year. This implies a rise of 4 percent year on year.

At an operating level, the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was posted at Rs 1,531.1 crore, a rise of 11 percent to previous year’s operating profit of Rs 1,375.5 crore.

The operating margin was reported at 22.1 percent against 20.7 percent last year.

“We did not review the financial results and other financial information, in respect of 24 subsidiaries including their associates and joint ventures, whose lnd AS financial results, without giving effect to elimination of intra-group transactions, include total assets of Rs 64,229.74 crore as of September 30, 2018, and total revenues of Rs 4,830.24 crore and Rs 10,125.72 crore for the quarter and the period ended on that date,” the company said in an exchange filing.

Sun Pharma will report its September quarter results on November 13, 2018. It is expected to post healthy net profit growth on the back of improved US business as well as new launches after Halol plant’s resolution.

Brokerages expect profit to be around Rs 950-1,087 crore.

Here’s a gist of what brokerages are expecting from the September quarter results announcement.

Brokerage: Axis Securities | PAT: Rs 960 crore

Axis Securities expects US business to grow 2 percent QoQ at USD 386 million. Lower interest income is likely to boost its PAT, it said.

Further, it expects domestic formulations to grow 4 percent YoY.

Meanwhile, higher staff and R&D costs could weigh on operating margins.

Brokerage: Emkay | PAT: Rs 1087.3 crore

Emkay expects US revenues to grow by 26 percent yoy on a lower base in Q2FY18. Sequentially, US revenue could remain flat owing to fewer product launches and base business erosion.

“We assume overall revenue and EBITDA of Rs 7,440 crore and Rs 1,730 crore with EBITDA margin of 23 percent (expansion of 260 bps yoy).”

Key developments to watch out for would be guidance on R&D spending and commentary on NCE launches and pipeline.

Brokerage: ICICI Securities | PAT: Rs 965 crore

Revenues are likely to increase 16 percent YoY to Rs 7,698 crore mainly due to 40 percent expected increase in US sales (ex-Taro) on the back of volume gains in existing products and new launches post Halol resolution.

EBITDA margins are expected to increase 82 bps YoY to 21.5 percent. They expect net profit to rise due to a strong operational performance, which is likely to be partly offset by higher tax rate0

Brokerage: Motilal Oswal | PAT: Rs 970 crore

Sun Pharmaceuticals is likely to register healthy 15 percent YoY growth in revenue to Rs 7,080 crore, primarily on the back of a growth in US and domestic business, the brokerage house said.

India business is expected to grow 15 percent YoY to Rs 2,030 crore, while US business is expected to grow 12 percent YoY to Rs 2,540 crore.

EBITDA is expected to increase significantly by 48 percent YoY to Rs 1,560 crore, with margin expansion to 22 percent primarily due to low base in 1QFY18 on the back of price erosion in US business.

Ramp-up of specialty products and resolution of the Halol plant will be the key growth drivers for the company.

Key issues to watch out

Outlook on new product launches and ANDA filings

Outlook for FY19E

Launch of Tildrakizumab and other key products

Brokerage: Kotak Institutional Equities | PAT: Rs 951.4 crore.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects Taro revenues to decline $5 million qoq.

“We expect EBITDA margins to decline to 21 percent (-120 bps qoq), reflecting the launch costs for Ilumya, as well as higher R&D spend (8 percent of sales). We expect base Taro EBITDA margins to decline 50 bps in the quarter, and expect ex-Taro EBITDA margin at 18.5 percent,” analysts at the firm wrote in their report.

Brokerage: Prabhudas Lilladher | PAT: Rs 984.2

Resolution on Halol plants to increase exports to US and higher USD to improve sales growth, the brokerage house said, adding that launch of specialty products in US could increase overheads.

Exposure in emerging markets could impact sequential margin in Q2FY19E."

It’s an opportune time for the deep value investors who are looking for mispriced stocks or ones that are trading significantly below their intrinsic value. Stocks across the sectors are tumbling, oil PSUs such as Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and recent carnage in Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL), Yes Bank and many non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are just examples of numerous falling knives.

While it is difficult to practice what Warren Buffett calls 'buy the fear', here are few points that can help in separating the wheat from the chaff.

Many of the stocks collapse for a reason and few offer an illusion of margin of safety, an idea based on the principles of value investing as taught by Benjamin Graham.

Evaluate: Do not try to predict the bottomLast year, investors of Infosys were grappling with the important question of who would head the company after the Vishal Sikka and if the growth journey would get derailed as a result of intensifying strife between the management and the founders. Today, Yes Bank’s shares are struggling probably for the same reason as market fear the uncertainty over the exit of its founder CEO Rana Kapoor. Investors love falling stocks and try to make their quick guess about the bottom.

But in most of these cases including the past few like PC Jeweller, Dilip Buildcon, Vakrangee, Manpasand Beverages and Infibeam, the sequence of events and news unfold in an abrupt manner. The first and foremost thing to do is to wait, take a note of the crisis and think before calling the shot.

Does market know something that you are missing?The investing legend, Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital coined this as ideas of second level thinking. A first-level thinker would always have an opinion about the future in terms of saying the company is good, outlook is favourable and stock will go up.

He says, “The second-level thinker takes many things into account: What is the range of likely future outcomes? Which outcome do I think will occur? What's the probability I am right? How does my expectation differ from the consensus? What will happen to the asset's price if the consensus turns out to be right, and what if I am right?”

Last year pharma stocks such as Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Lupin and many others were falling and investors were looking at them as perfect opportunities. But a section of the market knew about the pricing pressure in US generics that would impair growth and impact valuations.

Often the market may be reading something more than what the headlines are saying. Management of crisis-hit companies like Manpasand Beverages, Infibeam Avenues and Kwality have issued several clarifications. But that also did not help as market continued to look for information elsewhere. It is better to ask that muted question before taking a plunge.

What is in the price?At the time when the Nirav Modi-led scam hit Punjab National Bank, its reported net worth was about Rs 43,000 crore. This was in addition to the investments of about Rs 15,000 to Rs 18,000 crore in companies such as PNB Gilt, PNB Housing Finance, National Stock Exchange and others. Investors jumped into the stock hoping that even if the entire amount related to the scam is written off the bank should still be worth about Rs 45,000 crore. But the stock kept coming under pressure.

By the end of Q4 FY18, the bank surprised the market with a quarterly loss of Rs 13,400 crore. It followed that up with a Rs 940 crore loss in Q1 FY19, with net non-performing assets (NPAs) at 10.58 percent, which is massive on advances of Rs 4.38 lakh crore. A lot of these risk were not factored during the initial bouts of volatility. As the famous proverb goes, 'buy the rumour and sell the fact', markets often behave mischievously. It is thus important to separate the rumour from the fact and see what is in the price.

Is it cyclical or a structural issue?Some stocks would probably never recover or they continue to languish forever. The real test is to understand if it’s a structural or a cyclical issue. Infosys had a bad patch last year due to change in leadership and once that was fixed it is back in the business and investors radar. About few years back, Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) was hit by a crisis, and the company is currently trading at a 14 year low as it face serious threats and challenges to grow it business and find direction as opportunities dry up in the power sector.

Many of the IL&FS group stocks tumbled and the balance sheet of these companies are beyond repair.

Few years back Nestle had a difficult time when its flagship product - Maggi - was in the eye of a storm. For investors who believed that this was a short term phenomena, probably an impact for one or two quarters and company can survive with a few changes, this crisis turned out to be an opportunity. If one plots a 10 year share price graph of Nestle, this incident looks like a minor blip, which today is really difficult to spot.

Check value versus priceA stock falling from its 52-week high or stocks that have corrected the most grab more eye balls and investors often end up buying low price stock without realising what they are buying.

Lot of state-run banks look cheap on the basis of their price-to-book value. Even at half that ratio, market is not willing to buy them as they fear that the current book value may lose its relevance in the light of NPAs and the requirement for provisioning, which will ultimately erode book value.

If you can find a mispriced opportunity there is nothing like it. “Long term value investors have greater scope to produce superior risk-adjusted returns when the seas are rocky. The valid response when there's a crisis is to focus on the end destination, what value investors call intrinsic value, and not worry about whether the next wave is going to push the boat up or down”.

Marks focuses on intrinsic value. A cheap stock could remain cheap forever if the value is destroyed. Stocks like Gitanjali Gems never recovered from that cheap zone as the business was completely wiped out post the Nirav Modi crisis. Thus, price is important but only in relation with the value that one gets.

We have seen three consecutive black Fridays in a row. The Sensex fell over 4,600 points in just 25 sessions and Nifty crashed over 12 percent in the same period. The market capitalisation of BSE, which stood at Rs 1,59,34,695 crore in August, fell drastically to Rs 1,36,60,618 crore. This means investors lost almost Rs 22,74,077 crore in the turmoil.

Last month, market participants were talking about 12,200 levels on the Nifty, now they are talking about 9,000 levels. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices are down 23.56 percent and 31.42 percent from January highs. Most stocks are available 40-70 percent below their January’s highs.

Valuation looks attractive, but sentiment is still uncertain. Crude price, rupee weakness, high bond yields and liquidity issues are main concerns for the market which can play out over the next 2-5 months.

The only thing positive is corporate earnings. We have seen strong performance in Q1 and expect the same performance in Q2, which can support the market at lower levels.

Related stories

One thing is sure, investors have lost faith in the market and everybody lost money, some beyond their capacity, in the last 9 months.

Investors will get an opportunity to invest after companies announce their Q2 earnings to reshuffle and average out their portfolios. Companies posting a strong performance in Q2 can be added to one's watch-list as these stocks can provide above average returns after the dust settles.

Jubilant Foodworks

The company has posted fantastic numbers in Q1FY19 led by higher same-store-sales growth (SSSG). Its sales and EBITDA grew by 26 percent and 78.5 percent YoY, respectively, while PAT increased by 213.2 percent to 74.68 crore.

It reported EBITDA margin to 16.6 percent, an improvement of 490 bps on YoY basis. SSSG for Q1 stood at 25.9 percent. At the CMP, the stock trades at a P/E of 61x on TTM EPS. Stock already corrected 27 percent from recent high. We are recommending a buy in staggered manner for medium to long term.

Sun Pharma

Pharmaceutical stocks are little bit safe in this kind of market. Sun Pharma has reported better-than-expected performance in Q1FY19, led by healthy US sales (ex-Taro), strong growth in domestic business.

Its sales and EBITDA grew by 16 percent YoY and 47 percent YoY, respectively, while PAT increased by 87 percent. Taro has unperformed in Q1. Its US sales fell by 4.2 percent YoY, while ex-Taro US sales grew by 17.5 percent YoY to $240 million owing to launch of gWelchol AG, Yoansa and sales improvement from Halol unit. This clearly shows that Sun Pharma's dependency on the Taro is reducing.

India grew by 22 percent YoY on lower YoY base, while emerging markets business grew 21 percent YoY. We are expecting strong performance in Q2 also. We are recommending a buy in staggered manner for medium to long term.

Alkem Laboratories

Alkem Laboratories has reported excellent results for Q1FY19. Its sales and EBITDA grew by 27.19 percent YoY and 86.08 percent YoY, respectively, while PAT increased by 90.26 percent to 136.15 crore. EBITDA margins in Q1FY19 were at 14 percent vs 9 percent in Q4FY18 and 9 percent in Q1FY18. It has paid 650 percent dividend for FY18.

With tiny equity of just Rs 23.91 crore, company has huge reserve of around Rs 4,839.86 crore. In August, company has successfully cleared the USFDA inspection at Baddi plant.

Drug major Sun Pharma said it is looking to raise the share of complex generics and speciality products to its overall business portfolio going forward.

""While our speciality business will become an additional engine of growth for us, we will continue our relentless focus on the generics business and our attempt will be to find ways to grow the generics business faster than respective markets,"" Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Chairman Israel Makov said while addressing the company's AGM.

This should help the company to drive a stable and consistent growth in cash flows, which is a key objective of its corporate philosophy, he added while giving the overall outlook for the company.

""We are targeting to increase the share of complex generics and speciality products to our overall business in the coming years,"" Makov said.

This strategy will entail taking multiple initiatives, both organic and inorganic as well as assuming measured risks, he added.

""The speciality initiative will entail incurring up-front cost and investments for long-term benefits,"" Makov said.

The company's speciality portfolio targets dermatology, ophthalmic, oncology and CNS segments, he added."

Motilal Oswal's research report on Sun Pharma

The USFDA conducted an inspection at SUNP's Mohali plant during 10-14 September 2018, and issued Form 483 with two observations. We believe SUNP will be able to address these observations with a strong response, and subsequently take a corrective and preventive action (CAPA) plan on the same. Following this, we await product approvals and/or the Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) for regulatory compliance at Mohali. We remain positive on SUNP on the back of better traction in specialty portfolio, healthy growth in the generics business after offsetting the decline in base business, and better-than-industry growth in domestic formulations. Maintain 'Buy' with a price target of INR790 at 27x 12M forward earnings (unchanged).

Outlook

We maintain our estimates and value SUNP at 27x (unchanged) 12M forward earnings arriving at a price target of INR790. We believe that discount to its 3-year average P/E should narrow going forward as: (a) share of its specialty portfolio increases; (b) downside in base business erosion reduces; (c) healthy pipeline of ANDAs is pending for approval; and (d) there is a sustained outperformance in the domestic formulation market. Re-iterate ‘Buy’.

Centrum's research report on Sun Pharma

We maintain our Hold rating on Sun Pharma (SPIL) with TP of Rs580 (earlier Rs580) based on 26x March’20E EPS of Rs22.4. SPIL has developed a strong pipeline of specialty products for the US. It has received US FDA approval for Xelpros used in the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. We expect $22mn (Rs1.58bn) revenues from Xelpros in FY20. Key upside risks to our assumption include higher revenues from the US market and key downside risk includes regulatory risks for its manufacturing facilities catering to the global markets. We recommend a switch to Aurobindo or Cipla.

Outlook

We maintain our Hold rating on SPIL and maintain TP to Rs580 based on 26x March’20 EPS of Rs22.4 and downside of 12.8% from the CMP. Key positive risks to our assumptions would be higher growth in the US market and key negative risk would be regulatory risks for its manufacturing facilities. We recommend a switch to Aurobindo or Cipla.

While bulls were in full control until last month, September is turning out to be a lackluster month. The Nifty50, which touched a record high last month, saw sharp selling pressure in this month taking the index below 11,300.

Escalating trade war fears, sharp drop in the Indian rupee, growing concerns of rising current account deficit due to jump in crude oil prices, selling by foreign institutional investors and risk of rate hike by central bankers are some of the factors that weighed on Indian markets.

Global investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which have come out with their reports on Indian market, suggest that premium valuation could be a concern and the upside from current levels remains fairly limited.

Global investment firm Morgan Stanley has raised its 30-share BSE Sensex target to 42,000 for September 2019 implying a potential upside of 11 percent, on the other hand, Goldman Sachs maintains a target of 12,000 on Nifty which translates into an upside of little over 5 percent.

Goldman Sachs, which was strategically overweight on India since March 2014, has turned slightly cautious towards Indian market in 2018 and lowered its investment view to marketweight from overweight earlier.

Sectorally, the global investment bank has upgraded defensive stocks and exporters. It is overweight on banks, tech and metals. The key downside risks remain a less stable government.

Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, said Indian equities continued to be in an uptrend and investors should bet on favourite underperformers.

""Investors should choose price underperformers with improving earnings outlook and finally broaden their portfolios by adding small and midcaps,"" it said.

On its Focus List, Morgan Stanley added SBI, Prestige Estates and Apollo Hospitals, and removed Infosys, Havells India and Zee Entertainment, given the recent downgrades.

We have collated a list of top 10 fundamentally strong stocks from various experts which investors can look at buying with a minimum holding period of 1-2 years:

Analyst: DK Aggarwal, Chairman and MD, SMC Investments and Advisors Ltd

Dr Reddy’s Laboratories:

The company has reported robust first quarter FY19 results, aided by the launch of gSuboxone. According to the management of the company, it has focus on operational efficiencies which helped in significantly improving its margin profile.

In FY19, its priorities are driving productivity improvement, focusing on core therapeutic areas and big brands, and scaling up New Chemical Entity (NCE) launches done through the Amgen deal.

In the medium to long term, management of the company wants to focus on ramping up biosimilars through internal and partnered assets and building differentiated products in relevant therapies accompanied by further ramping up of the base business.

The management expects 15-20 launches in FY19 and also expects emerging markets to grow 16% YoY led by a robust spurt in Russia and ROW.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises:

The company has led the industry in its evolution and transformation. Along the way, it has entered newer geographies, both domestically and globally, launched multiple channels, strengthened distribution, expanded the genres and widened its audience profile.

Moreover, management focus towards expansion and market share would give strong growth to the company in coming years. During the quarter, its consolidated advertising revenue grew by 18.6% to Rs 1,146 crore.

Domestic advertising revenue growth at 22.3% continued to be strong driven by demand across categories and partly aided by lower growth in the base quarter.

Bajaj Auto:

The company has a diversified business model and has a strong focus on the profitable growth, widening reach in export markets and strategic alliances with global majors.

The domestic 2-wheeler market would start growing from the festive season & would continue to grow for next couple of years. The management has assured that the company would see a very healthy top line growth and a very healthy EBITDA increase in coming quarters.

FY18-19 capex plan stands around Rs 250-300 crore. It would look to expand and strengthen the 150cc Pulsar segment in addition to pursuing new three-wheeler markets within India.

Its total current capacity is approximately about 6.6 million. 3-wheelers will be approximately about 7.2 lakh. The company expects 1.9 million export numbers for FY 19.

UPL:

The company has strong fundamentals and a robust outlook. Its strong focus on brand building and customer reach is helping the company in increasing its market share in major addressable markets.

Moreover, with the acquisition with Arysta LifeScience, the company will be one of the world's largest global crop protection companies, with an innovative and differentiated product portfolio.

The management has been focussing on technological enhancement and new product developments which would aid the further financial growth of the company. Moreover, the company believes new launches would bear fruit in the coming term.

Indian Hotels Company:

The Company plans to continue to grow through a judicious mixture of owned and leased hotels, a de-risked model along with its ability to attract management contracts.

Its command and long & successful track record in operating hotels for third party owners would facilitate growth for the future.

Moreover, it has the ability to deliver improved returns on capital would be driven through product renovation, rigorous asset management, revenue maximization, cost control and reduced leverage and exit from non-core underperforming assets.

It has assigned a capex of Rs 3,000 crore for the next five years and hotel industry occupancy levels and average room rate (ARR) are showing upward trends due to a demand-supply gap.

Analyst: Deepak Jasani, Head – Retail Research at HDFC Securities

Mahanagar Gas:

Monopolistic nature of the business and ramp-up/expansion in new geographies would drive volume growth in the coming years. Better economics of CNG/PNG versus liquid fuels in an era of a buoyant crude price regime and maintained spreads are tailwinds for the company.

Axis Bank:

Axis Bank has made significant investments to ride the next growth cycle (post-near-term asset quality challenges), with strong capitalisation and an expanding liability franchise.

The worst seems to have been priced in, and the bank is available at attractive valuations as compared to other similarly-placed peers. The new CEO could bring in a fresh perspective to the bank’s growth plans.

Rico Auto:

Post its split with FCC in 2015 Rico Auto has changed its strategy and now caters to PV and CV markets in addition to 2W. Strong order book of Rs 4800cr, capacity expansion and increasing volumes in alloy wheels, changing product mix are expected to improve the OPM.

Rico is in the process of launching 3 more products and improving profitability may help it get re-rated to a PE comparable with other auto-ancillary companies.

Engineers India:

EIL is likely to benefit from the expected capex in the hydrocarbon and petrochemicals industry as it is a market leader for consultancy. It’s a debt-free company with an order backlog of Rs 7229cr (~3.5x book-to-bill). With a healthy cash balance of Rs 2500cr, it may reward shareholders through another buyback or special dividend.

Sun Pharma:

Sun Pharma is amongst the few companies in India to have made large upfront investments in US specialty. OPM are expected to improve on the back of key drugs launch and moderating price erosion in the US.

The company has 422 approved products in USA and 139 pending for approval. Ramp up of generics and specialty business driven by increased investments augurs well for the company as it improves the launch visibility.

This was an action-packed week for the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors with the ban on fixed drug combinations (FDCs), fresh developments in the Singh brothers' saga and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries' US Food and Drug Administration approval.

FDC ban

This week saw the government banning 329 Fixed Drug Combinations (FDCs). FDC is a cocktail of two or more drug ingredients.

The government took the decision after the sub-committee headed by Nilima Kshirsagar under the Drug Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) gave its recommendation supporting the ban.

The government ban mostly covered drug cocktails for treating cold and cough, antibiotics, painkillers, anti-depressants, diabetic drugs, among others. The sales of these drugs accounted for 0.8 percent, or around Rs 1,040 crore, of the total sales in Indian Pharmaceutical Market in the year ended August 2018, according to pharmaceutical market research firm AIOCD.

Another 15 FDCs largely cold and cough brands have managed to escape the ban, as they were approved before 1988. These are said to be worth over Rs 750 crore including brands such as Abbott's Phensedyl Cough Linctus, Griffon's Grilinctus, Cipla’s Cofdex, Nocold and Bromolin, Glenmark’s Ascoril C, Intas' Despol and Reckitt Benckiser's D-Cold Total.

FDCs in India is a controversial subject. While WHO recommends just 25 FDCs for treating specific diseases like HIV, hepatitis-C, malaria and tuberculosis, in India, there is a combination for almost every drug. Most of them exist to bypass the drug price controls imposed by the government.

Singh brothers' saga

There is no end in sight for Singh brothers' saga. Just a week after Shivinder Singh filed a petition in National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against his elder brother Malvinder Singh and for Religare executive Sunil Godhwani, alleging 'oppression and mismanagement' of RHC Holding, Religare Enterprises and Fortis Healthcare, he withdrew the case citing respect for their mother.

Shivinder went on to make serious allegations against brothers like misappropriation of funds, forgery and pushing the group into a debt trap.

Shivinder said that he wants to settle the case amicably with his brother, but the split will stand.

But Shivinder's complaint was damaging for the brothers as Religare Enterprises moved NCLT against brothers to recover siphoned funds.

The brothers have lost management control over Fortis and Religare and are facing heat from Japanese drug maker Daichii Sankyo, which is trying to enforce a Rs 3,500-crore arbitration award it got from a tribunal in Singapore. Last month, Fortis shareholders' approved a sale of their company to Malaysia’s IHH Healthcare for $1.1 billion.

Sun Pharma gets US nod to Xelpros

India's largest drug maker Sun Pharma announced that it got an approval from USFDA for its specialty opthalmic drug Xelpros, which is used to treat chronic eye disease glaucoma.

Interestingly, the New Drug Application (NDA) of Xelpros was filed from the Halol site in Gujarat. The approval from Halol site is significant as it comes after the recent noise surrounding the observations received by the facility. USFDA had withheld approvals from this facility for four years due to a warning letter but cleared the facility early this year.

Sun Pharma management earlier indicated that the peak sales guidance of Xeplros is expected to be in the range of $50-$75 million over two to three years.

Indian Pharmaceutical Market grew 8.7 percent in August

The Indian pharmaceutical market (IPM) grew at 8.7 percent in August, much slower than in July due to lacklustre sales of anti-infective drugs, according to market research firm AIOCD-AWACS.

In July, the industry grew at the fastest past of 12.7 percent.

IPM grew close to 10 percent in first five months of this financial year FY19, returning to the 10 percent growth of FY17. In FY18, the growth dropped to 6.1 percent in the run-up to GST and its subsequent implementation.

The IPM reported sales of Rs 11,342 crore for August."

Sun Pharma, India's largest drug maker on Friday said it got an approval from USFDA for its specialty opthalmic drug Xelpros, which is used to treat chronic eye disease glaucoma.

The New Drug Application (NDA) of Xelpros was filed from the Halol site in Gujarat. Sun Pharma management earlier indicated that the peak sales guidance of Xeplros is expected to be in the range of $50-$75 million over two to three years.

Sun Pharma in-licensed Xelpros from SPARC in June 2015 and this approval will trigger a milestone payment to SPARC. SPARC is also eligible for milestone payments and royalties on commercialisation of Xelpros in the US. SPARC, is research led company which was demerged from parent Sun Pharma in 2006.

Xelpros is the first and only form of latanoprost that is not formulated with benzalkonium chloride (BAK), a preservative commonly used in topical ocular preparations that may cause allergic reactions. Xelpros is developed using SPARC’s proprietary Swollen Micelle Microemulsion (SMM) technology.

“As the only BAK-free version of latanoprost, XELPROSTM will be an important and alternative treatment option for individuals with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension,” said Abhay Gandhi, CEO, North America, Sun Pharma.

“This approval, coming less than one month following the approval of CEQUA (cyclosporine ophthalmic solution) 0.09%, reaffirms the strength of Sun Pharma’s fast-growing Ophthalmics division and its commitment to serving the needs of patients with ocular disorders,” said

Anil Raghavan, CEO, SPARC.

Xelpros will be commercialised in the US by Sun Ophthalmics, the branded ophthalmic division of Sun Pharma.

In the US, glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, second only to macular degeneration. More than 2.25 million Americans older than 40 years have open-angle glaucoma.

Worldwide, glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness, surpassed only by cataracts; more than 2 million people around the world will develop open-angle glaucoma each year, and more than 3 million are bilaterally blind that is in both eyes from open-angle glaucoma."

Credit Suisse has maintained an ""outperform"" rating on Sun Pharmaceutical Industries with a target price of Rs 705.

Credit Suisse added that it sees a potential upside of 12 percent for the stock.

The observations made by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week at the firm's Halol plant in Gujarat are not very critical, Credit Suisse added.

The FDA has also launched an investigation into the company's Mohali plant in Punjab, Sun Pharma confirmed yesterday.

At 11:25 hrs Sun Pharmaceutical Industries was quoting at Rs 637.50, up 1.02 percent from the previous close.

The stock picked up after losing as much as 1.75 percent in early trade.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Sun Pharma

US FDA recently conducted an inspection at SUNP's Halol plant from 27-31 August and issued Form-483 with six observations. We believe the observations are resolvable and should not impact existing business and/or new approvals, pertaining to SUNP. We raise EPS estimate by 1%/3% for FY19/FY20 to factor in the favorable currency movement. We expect a premium for SUNP to further expand from 25% to 35%, compared to an industry average of 20x 12M Forward Earnings on the back of increasing share of specialty portfolio. SUNP is the only Indian-listed entity, which is progressing well in the specialty portfolio. We believe, the incremental generics business from new launches should be higher than base business erosion, and sustained outperformance in the domestic formulation business should also support multiple re-rating.

Outlook

Accordingly, we raise our P/E multiple to 27x (from 25x earlier) and revise our price target to INR790 (from INR700 earlier); reiterate a Buy.

Madhuchanda Dey Moneycontrol Research

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries reported a decent performance in Q1 FY19. Speciality business is the focus area and an impending opportunity, but might come with elevated near term sales expenditure and continued higher R&D spend. With a leadership position in the domestic pharmaceutical business and a challenging but exciting road ahead in the US, we see Sun as a stock to consider for core exposure in the pharma pack.

The stock has been an outperformer. Hence, valuation at 25 times FY20e earnings captures the near term positives. With an earnings compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in mid-20s, the stock will remain a market performer and should be accumulated with a medium to long term horizon.

Quarter at a glance

The company delivered excellent Q1 result that saw its topline grow 16 percent. Growth was led by strong traction in domestic formulations, emerging market as well as the US business.



Source: Company

Sale of Indian branded formulations grew 22 percent, partly aided by the base impact from the Goods & Services Tax (GST) in the year-ago quarter. The company is the market leader with 8.3 percent market share. In the quarter under review, it launched 16 new products in the Indian market.

The US business (excluding Taro) also saw a revival. The launch of speciality Yonsa and authorised generic for Welchol contributed to growth. The management maintained that the pricing environment remains challenging and the base business continues to face pressure.



Source: Company

The change in the product mix resulted in gross margin erosion but the company managed to maintain a respectable operating margin of over 22 percent, despite incurring R&D cost to the tune of Rs 500 crore, or 7 percent of sales. With the management’s focus on sales as well as R&D for the specialty business, expenditure on sales and marketing as well as R&D will be higher in the coming quarters. It has guided to 8-9 percent of sales as R&D expenses.

The company has a comprehensive product offering in the US market consisting of approved Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDAs) for 428 products and 135 ANDAs awaiting approval, including 15 tentative approvals. In Q1, three ANDAs were filed and six approvals were received. Sun has received the Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) from the US Food & Drug Administration for the Halol facility in June and expects several approvals from this facility.

The speciality business

For investors, the key area to watch out for is its speciality business as FY19 is going to be an important year. Sun obtained USFDA approval for oncology drug Yonsa and has recently commercialised the same. The management expects this product to be a meaningful opportunity going forward.

The company is planning to launch Ilumya in Q2. It a biologic drug administered subcutaneously to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis. This will be fighting for its share in the $9 billion market. The management said the drug has lesser side-effects, higher efficacy and lasting effect but added that the market is competitive. Sun will be vying to garner a fair share in the market.

The other launch planned in FY19 is OTX -101 (Cequa), a formulation of cyclosporine that will allow the company to participate in the rapidly growing underserved and dynamic dry eye market. OTX-101 will be commercialised in the US by Sun Ophthalmics, the branded ophthalmics division of Sun Pharma’s wholly-owned subsidiary.

The company is awaiting approval from US FDA for two specialty products - Xelpros and Elepsia - filed from Halol. Despite Q1 being above expectation, the management maintained its FY19 guidance of low double-digit growth. The fate of the new launches could be the joker in the pack.

We continue to like the strong domestic business of Sun and the niche that it is trying to create with speciality in the US. The worst in terms of US channel consolidation is largely behind. Hence, the earnings growth trajectory should normalise and accelerate from FY20 and beyond. Long term investors should consider Sun Pharma as part of their core holding."

Sun Pharma started off the financial year 2018-19 on a strong note as first quarter earnings beat analysts' estimates on strong India and US sales, but brokerage houses turned mixed on their ratings.

CLSA and HSBC remained positive on the stock but Citi maintained its Neutral call and Prabhudas Lilladher Reduce rating on Sun Pharma.

The stock rallied as much as 2 percent in morning on Thursday, in addition to 7 percent upside seen on Tuesday. At 10:14 hours IST, the stock price was quoting at Rs 612.10, up 1.74 percent on the BSE.

Sun Pharma reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 982.8 crore in the first quarter ended June against a net loss of Rs 423 crore in year-ago. Profit in Q1FY18 was adversely impacted by the settlement with certain plaintiffs related to the Modafinil antitrust litigation in the US, with the settlement amounting to Rs 951 crore.

Adjusted net profit excluding the impact of this settlement was around Rs 525 crore. Q1FY19 profit is 87 percent higher year-on-year (YoY) on this adjusted profit.

Revenues for Q1FY19 rose 16.7 percent YoY to Rs 7,423.9 crore from Rs 6,360.8 crore in the year-ago period. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margin for the quarter was 21.3 percent.

A Reuters poll had forecast a rise in net profit to Rs 900 crore. It estimated a revenue gain of 12.8 percent YoY to Rs 6,957 crore.

Specialty Initiatives

“We are gradually crossing key milestones in our specialty initiatives with the recent commercialization of Yonsa in the US and targeted launch of Ilumya and Cequa in the coming quarters,"" Dilip Shanghvi, Managing Director of Sun Pharma.

Shanghvi added the drugmaker is awaiting approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for two specialty products, Xelpros and Elepsia, filed from Halol.

""With all these specialty launches lined-up, a substantial portion of our current specialty pipeline will be on market. We are creating a deep pipeline of specialty products, however, during the year these launches will result in significant upfront investments,"" Shanghvi said.

Sun Pharma said it continued to evaluate opportunities in the specialty segment to further enhance this business.

Here are brokerage houses' views on Sun Pharma post its Q1 earnings:

CLSA

While revising target price to Rs 750 from Rs 600 earlier, global brokerage firm said US and India businesses showed a positive surprise for the quarter ended June.

Specialty launches in the US is on track and execution will be the key from here on, it added.

HSBC

HSBC also feels that specialty initiatives are remained on track with planned launch of Ilumya in Q2FY19. We will watch for execution as significant upfront costs build up for specialty efforts.""

The research house has raised its target price to Rs 565 from Rs 525 earlier.

Citi

The research house said strong US and low R&D spend helped its earnings beat analyst estimates.

US traction is encouraging but margins could taper a bit, it feels.

It has maintained neutral rating on the stock with a target price at Rs 600 per share.

Prabhudas Lilladher

Management maintained low double digit growth in revenues with 8-9 percent of R&D expenditures (mainly for specialty portfolio) in FY19E.

It also cautioned of significant cost push (promotion, marketing and employee) of launching three branded specialty products in FY19E.

Expecting continuation of headwinds in US generics, Sun Pharma guided for launch of generics with limited competition in FY19E.

Its valuation remains challenging and one of the highest among its peers as it trades at PE of 34.6x and 31.3x of FY19E and FY20E.

We believe that the valuation remains stretched and maintain Reduce and target price at Rs 447.

Macquarie

Adjusted for lower R&D spend & tax rate, Q1 performance was in-line with estimates.

With a recovery in ex-Taro US sales, material earnings downside seems limited.

India's largest drug maker, Sun Pharma, is likely to report a 71 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in its net profit for the June quarter on the back of sales growth in India and the depreciation in the rupee.

The company's US sales may remain flat, but are expected to gain momentum because of the resolution of irregularities pertaining to quality standards at its Halol plant, and launches of specialty drugs.

The growth in the domestic formulation business will be aided by the low base of the corresponding quarter last year on account of supply chain disruption caused by the rollout of goods and services tax.

For the first quarter of FY17, the company had reported a net profit of Rs 525.6 crore.

The average of estimates of analysts polled by Reuters pegged the company's net profit for the reporting quarter at Rs 900 crore and its revenue Rs 6,957, up 12.8 percent on year.

Analysts expect the company's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation margin to be around 20 percent.

Sun Pharma's US-listed subsidiary Taro Pharmaceutical Industries' sales for the June quarter fell 4.2 percent on year to $154.6 million.

But Taro reported a 23.5 percent rise in its net income for the quarter to $67.3 million, despite putting up a weak operational show, and incurring higher tax expense.

The growth in its bottom line was largely because of foreign exchange gains and finance income.

""Expect US revenue ($365 millon) to remain flat sequentially, with Taro expected to decline by 4 percent (~$5 million) sequentially,"" said Edelweiss Research in its report.

""Base business erosion is likely to offset launch of generic Welchol AG and commercialisation of Yonsa. Domestic sales expected to grow 20 percent YoY, on a favourable base impacted by GST related disruptions,"" the research firm said.

""Management has given low double-digit growth guidance for consolidated sales for FY2019 based on the assumption that Halol will be cleared in H2FY2019. EIR comes as an early surprise and clears the path for new product approvals and launches. Now the focus shifts to business performance and approvals to drive growth in the US business as the key monitorable,"" domestic brokerage Sharekhan said in a recent report.

Sun Pharma, India’s largest drug maker, on Wednesday said it got its first-ever USFDA approval for a product filed from the Halol facility in Gujarat after receipt of Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) last month.

EIR indicates closure of US FDA inspection.

This chemotherapy drug, called INFUGEM 10 mg/mL, is a combination of gemcitabine in 0.9% sodium chloride injection used in treatment of cancer.

The addressable market size is approximately $35 million for the 12 months ending March 2018, as per IQVIA.

US FDA in June concluded that the agency’s inspection of Halol site is closed and the issues contained in the Warning Letter issued in December 2015 have been addressed, paving the way for fresh approvals.

US FDA blocked approvals of Sun Pharma's largest manufacturing site Halol due to deviations of current good manufacturing practices.

Read here, on how Sun Pharma managed to get its Halol facility off the USFDA hook.

“The technology used to formulate INFUGEM eliminates the risks associated with compounding, an extra step in the administration of cytotoxic infusion products, providing improved safety for healthcare professionals and cancer patients,” said Abhay Gandhi, CEO, North America, Sun Pharma.

“We’re pleased to add this novel product to our expanding oncology portfolio, as gemcitabine is one of the most commonly used cytotoxics in oncology practices,” Gandhi added.

Shares of Sun Pharma rose 0.43 percent and were trading at Rs 551.15 on BSE at 12.15 pm, the benchmark Sensex gained 0.07 percent to 36,544.80 points."

DUSA Pharmaceuticals, a wholly-owned subsidiary of India's largest drugmaker Sun Pharma Thursday said it has filed trade secret misappropriation and tortious interference claims in an ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against German drug maker Biofrontera and its subsidiaries in the US.

The lawsuit filed by DUSA alleged infringement of its patents, US 9,723,991 and US 8,216,289 of its product Levulan Kerastick (aminolevulinic acid HCl) for a topical solution, used with Dusa’s proprietary BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator.

Sun Pharma bought DUSA in 2012 paying $230 million to gain access to its light-based skin treatment platform.

In its amended complaint, DUSA additionally alleged the Biofrontera defendants misappropriated confidential and trade secret information from it and improperly obtained confidential information from former DUSA employees to sell and market defendants’ own products. The lawsuit seeks an assessment of both damages and injunctive relief against the Biofrontera defendants.

The patents-in-suit concern an apparatus and method for “photodynamic therapy” and equipment for PDT.

The photodynamic therapy, pioneered by DUSA, combines a drug with a light source to treat disease conditions. The product was launched by DUSA in September 2000 in the US.

DUSA’s Levulan combination therapy is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for treatment of non-hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses or AKs of the face or scalp."

Investors will watch out for global stock markets this week amid absence of any major domestic cues. On the global front, Japan’s balance of trade data for May will be disclosed on June 18. Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) monetary policy meeting minutes will be unveiled on June 20. Policymakers also kept the 10-year government bond yield target around zero percent but dropped the inflation target date for reaching 2 percent.

In the US, existing home sales data for May will be disclosed on June 20. The Bank of England (BoE) will decide on interest rate on June 21. Japan's inflation data for May will be disclosed on June 22.

Brent crude hovers above the $75 per barrel mark. Rise in oil prices raises India's import bill as the country imports majority of its crude requirements. A weak rupee raises the cost of importing crude oil.

Back home, investment by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and domestic institutional investors (DIIs) will also set the course for the stock market. Other key factors such as rupee's movements against the dollar and fluctuations in crude oil prices as well as developments on the monsoon's progress will impact investors' risk-taking appetite.

Sun Pharma | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 650 | Return: 13%

Following the VAI classification by USFDA for Halol unit last week, Sun Pharma has got EIR which indicates closure of FDA audit at Halol. It has been nearly four years since the September 2014 inspection when Halol first came under FDA scanner for non compliance resulting in zero approvals from Halol since then.

It has been a long wait for Sun to come back to full compliance and should result in quick approvals going ahead. Out of total 139 ANDA’s and 3 NDA’s pending, we believe several key filings for injectables, complex oral drugs and SPARC products are awaiting approval from Halol. Receipt of EIR is a positive development for Sun and paves way for gradual ramp up of Halol unit.

Faster approvals for Generics will help Sun to absorb overheads and support margins expansion in next couple of years, despite higher marketing spend on specialty launches.

It has made superb double bottom formation at Rs 435. After a smart move in short time, stock has strong hurdle near Rs 585-605 levels. Cross over will take it to Rs 650+ levels. Down side strong support exist at Rs 540-537 levels. We are recommending a buy on dips.

SAIL | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 95-101| Return: 18%

SAIL has posted highest EBITDA per tonne in 4QFY18 since FY11. We think this kind of realization will continue on back of better than expected China steel demand, continuing supply limits and falling inventories. SAIL’s management is targeting 28 percent volume growth in FY19. Capacity expansion from 12.5mt to 20mt is almost complete.

FY18 volumes rose 7 percent to 14mt; management expects 18mt in FY19, sharper acceleration in 2HFY19, close to rated production in two years.

Looking at sustained realization numbers and valuation of SAIL we are recommending a buy on dips. Sail has shown a superb move from Rs 67-68 levels. Now Rs 91 will be a strong hurdle for this stock, cross over will take it to Rs 95-101 levels in very short time. Downside Rs 78-80 will be support zone for this stock. One can buy with stoploss of Rs 78.

Dynamic Industries | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 140-150| Return: 44%

Dynamic Industries is in the business of manufacturing of Chemical and main product of the company is dye and dye stuffs. Significant revenue portion consists of exports.

The Company exports its products to Germany, the United States, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Italy, Turkey, Switzerland, Russia, Pakistan, Spain, Brazil, and Argentina.

The Company sells its products through a well-established network in different countries, which are supported by the company’s strong marketing force. The company has the plans to penetrate better into world market, especially through the customer retention and business development in the regions which have not been tapped.

Company is taking effective steps to improve operational efficiency to maintain the earnings. At present many policies are being formed/adopted by the present government, which may be beneficial to the company in future.

For FY18, its PAT zoomed 76 percent to Rs 3.08 crore on 21% higher sales of Rs 59.16 crore fetching an EPS of Rs 10.08. It has support near Rs 95-90 levels.

Upper side minor hurdle exist at Rs 117-119 levels. Cross over will take it to Rs 140-150 levels in medium term. We are recommending a strong buy.

This past week saw investors rushing to take advantage of pharmaceutical stocks that were trading at reasonable valuations, aided by some positive newsflow about companies resolving their pending regulatory compliance woes and faster approvals.

The BSE Healthcare index gained 6.28 percent this week, while the benchmark Sensex rose 0.42 percent

The big news this week was Sun Pharma receiving the much anticipated establishment inspection report or EIR – indicating closure of inspection for its Halol facility. Halol is the company's largest manufacturing site and has been under the cloud after the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter on December 2015. Read here to find out how the drug maker managed to get its Halol facility off the US FDA hook.

Dr Reddy’s, which is otherwise bogged down by Form 483s, inspections and resolution timelines jumped into the action after a long gap with the US FDA's nod to sell generic Suboxone sublingual film used in treatment of drug addiction in the US.

The company wasted no time, went ahead with 'at risk' launch on day one of the approval even as the patent litigation was still on. As expected it immediately drew a blowback from innovator Indivior, a spun-off of British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser, maker of products ranging from antiseptic brand Dettol to Durex condoms.

Indivior, which has more to lose from the generic entry, got a restraining order from a US court, holding Dr Reddy’s from temporarily selling the product. The hearing is scheduled for June 28.

Fortis – action shifts to June last weekThe week started with Fortis deferring its Q4 and FY18 results for the second time. The healthcare provider cited need for additional time to consider certain aspects of the Luthra & Luthra’s investigation report in its financial accounts.

The board in March has appointed an external legal firm to investigate whether there are any breaches in its internal control procedures in light of the promoters taking out nearly Rs 473 crore.

Luthra & Luthra submitted its report to the board on June 8.

Fortis' board did not disclose details of the internal investigation report, but said it had shared the findings with its statutory auditors.

The company said it will report its Q4 numbers on June 25. The delay in announcing its results also had an impact on the timelines of the bidding process. Fortis now extended the date for submission of bids to June 28. The earlier deadline for submission of bids was on June 14.

Meanwhile Moneycontrol reported that it’s actually the statutory auditor who was held from signing Fortis' Q4 accounts for want of additional information related to certain finding in the Luthra & Luthra report.

Fortis called off the demerger of its diagnostics arm, SRL, citing headwinds for the sector.

The demerger of SRL, which the board cleared in August 2016, was expected to unlock value in its diagnostics business, but it moved at snail’s pace while the circumstances and priorities of the company have altered with the exit of erstwhile promoters and their patrons on the board no more calling the shots.

Analysts tracking the company pointed out that it doesn’t make sense to pursue the demerger when the entire company is up for sale."

Centrum Research's research report on Sun Pharma

We maintain our Hold rating on Sun Pharma (SPIL) with TP of Rs530 (earlier Rs520) based on 26x March’20E EPS of Rs20.4. SPIL’s Q4FY18 revenues were in-line with our expectations. EBIDTA margin and net profit exceeded our expectations. The drug maker’s revenue declined 2% YoY, margins improved by 240bps to 24.1%, and net profit grew 10% YoY. SPIL is facing supply constraints at its Halol facility. Key upside risks to our assumption include higher revenues from the US market and key downside risk includes regulatory risks for its manufacturing facilities catering to the global markets. We recommend a switch to Aurobindo or Cipla.

Outlook

We maintain our Hold rating on SPIL with revised TP to Rs530 based on 26x March’19 EPS of Rs20.4 and upside of 7.2% from the CMP. Key positive risks to our assumptions would be higher growth in the US market and key negative risk would be regulatory risks for its manufacturing facilities. We recommend a switch to Aurobindo or Cipla.For all recommendations report, click here

India’s largest drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical's consolidated net profit rose 6.94 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 1,309 crore in the fourth quarter ended March, beating analysts' estimates.

The profit was boosted by a one-time tax benefit of Rs 259 crore in Q4 related to certain intangibles. Excluding the one-time tax benefit of Rs. 259 crore, the adjusted net profit for the quarter was Rs. 1,050 crores.

The company said they also had USD 20 million milestone payment in the fourth quarter from Spanish drug maker Almirall as part of the licensing agreement for the development and commercialization of Tildrakizumab for psoriasis in Europe.

Consolidated EBITDA margin stood at 24.1 percent in Q4FY18.

A Reuters poll had forecast a drop in net profit to Rs 947.4 crore. It estimated a revenue decline of 0.68 percent YoY to 6,778.8 crore.

“Over the last four quarters, we have been able to record a gradual improvement in performance despite a challenging US generic pricing environment,"" said Dilip Shanghvi, Managing Director of Sun Pharma.

The company said FY19 will see roll out of company's specialty pipeline.

""FY19 will mark the crossing of some important milestones in our specialty journey with the likely launch of 3 specialty products in the US – Ilumya, OTX-101 and Yonsa – which will entail upfront investments,"" Shanghvi added.

Shanghvi said his company will continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions in the specialty segment to further enhance this business.

While US generic sales declined 3 percent YoY to USD 368 million in Q4FY18, India sales grew 2 percent to Rs. 1,963 crores.

The results were announced after market hours.

Shares of Sun Pharma rose 0.97 percent to close at Rs 466.55 on BSE, the benchmark Sensex gained 0.78 percent to 34,924.87 points.

""EBITDA grew 9%YoY to Rs 16.8bn, with 24% EBITDA margin. However, there was higher other operating income in this quarter. If you assume normalized other operating income, EBITDA would have been in line with our estimates with 21-22% EBITDA margin (flat QoQ),"" Chalke said."

Motilal Oswal's research report on Sun Pharma

The Halol facility received 23 483 observations post US FDA inspection in September 2014. Later, in December 2015, US FDA had issued a warning letter for the facility. In November/December 2016, US FDA re-inspected the facility and issued nine 483 observations and maintained OAI status. OAI is given when objectionable conditions are found and regulatory action should be recommended.

Outlook

We maintain Buy, with a revised TP of INR610 (24x FY20E EPS). Our earlier TP was INR560 (22x FY20E EPS). We have increased our target multiple, given enhanced visibility of Halol resolution by 2HFY19.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Sun Pharma

The US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) inspected Sun Pharma’s (SUNP) Halol plant from 12-23 February 2018. Notably, the number of observations has come down to three this time from nine in the last inspection that was conducted in December 2016. Given that none of three observations issued in the recent inspection are serious in nature (two are procedural in nature and one is related to aseptic processing of drug products), we expect resolution of the facility over the coming months.

Outlook

The company is trading at ~24x/19x FY19E/20E PER, which is ~15% below 10-year average valuations. We maintain our Buy rating on SUNP with a target price of INR675 @ 24x FY20E PER.For all recommendations report, click here

The US FDA inspection of Sun Pharma's crucial Halol site in Gujarat that was widely expected to end on Friday, could possible extend by a day or two, said sources.

The facility is under US FDA warning letter since December 2015.

The drug maker declined to comment. Dilip Shanghvi, who is attending the India Pharmaceutical Forum, said the company as a policy will not talk on ongoing regulatory inspections.

The current US FDA inspection began on February 12.

Halol is critical for Sun Pharma as most of the complex pipeline that includes injectables, topical solutions and inhalation products are filed from this facility. Sun Pharma is banking on complex products to beat the pricing pressure it faces in the US market.

The current inspection was triggered after US FDA re-inspected the Halol facility from November 17, 2016 through December 1, 2016 and issued nine Form 483 observations.

The observations were related to data reporting standards, testing procedures, and lab controls.

Halol is an important plant for the company and contributed 12-15 percent to its US sales before the factory received a warning letter from the US FDA for violation of manufacturing norms in December 2015.

The warning letter blocked new product approval from that facility impacting the company’s US business.

Prior to warning letter, Halol was contributing about USD 400 million to topline or nearly 12-15 percent of sales. Now the facility's contribution has fallen to about 250 million.

Sun Pharma's profit fell 75.2 percent to Rs 365.4 crore in the quarter ended December hit by plunging US sales and one-time deferred tax adjustment. Revenues from operations declined 16 percent to Rs 6,653.23

""The resolution of the facility is important if the company has to maintain USD 1.5 billion topline in US market,"" said Amey Chalke, Research Analyst at HDFC Securities.

CLSA forecasts increemental revenue from the clearance of Halol is expected to be at least USD 100 million and USD 150 million in years ending March 2019 and 2020, and even possibly go up to USD 200 million and USD 300 million, increasing its earnings per share by 4 and 10 percent."

A major fire broke out at India's largest drug maker Sun Pharma's intermediate and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing site in Ankleshwar GIDC, Gujarat in the early hours of Sunday.

The drugmaker said the fire was put off by the site firefighting team with the support of fire tenders.

The company spokesperson said that the situation is under control and there were no injuries during this incident.

The company didn't specify the quantum of loss and said a detailed investigation is under progress.

“A fire was observed at the solvent storage area at Sun Pharma’s Ankleshwar (Gujarat) Plant in the early hours of Feb 4, 2018,"" the spokesperson statement said.

""There was no direct loss of production because of this incident. A detailed investigation is under progress,” the statement added.

The company had a similar fire accident at Ahmednagar in December 2016 that killed two people and injured two others.

Fire accidents are not uncommon at pharma facilities, as there is always a looming risk of a blast given the explosive nature of chemicals, in addition to boilers and reactors the companies work with.

Fire at facilities may sometimes attract surprise inspections by the US and Europe drug regulators. Aurobindo Pharma had a similar sudden and rigorous inspection after its API facility in Srikakulam had a fire last year."

Predicting bullish sectors of next Samvat 2074

Every year we release sectors of new Samvat in the month of March/April when new Samvat starts. But this year, we shall prepone release of next Samvat sectors, which are going to get strong astrological support & stocks from those sector outperform markets.

Needless to mention our innumerable past predictions, where most stocks from the SECTORS of SAMVAT gave exorbitant returns & certain stocks appreciated by over 500 percent.

During current Samavat 2073 among other sectors – DYES/CHEMICAL/SUGAR sector received strong astrological support & outperformed gave exorbitant return. Many stocks from DYES/ CHEMICAL sector appreciated by over 500 percent.

Sectors which get strong astrological support also start getting favourable news along with all kind of positive support by regulatory authorities in that industry, resulting in strong growth & super positive results. Most of problems also start resolving.

Sectors which get very strong astrological support are not normally affected by downfall in the market."

Research and broking firm ICICIdirect expects healthcare companies to report recovery in revenue growth for the quarter ended December 17, mainly on account of low base last year in the domestic business impacted by demonetisation.

However, it expect EBITDA margin decline of 280bps YoY due to continued pressure on US business and increased R&D spend despite delay in key product launches. The margin and PAT decline would be due to poor performance in Glenmark, Lupin and Sun Pharma.

Increased competition and pricing pressure would continue to impact growth in US focussed companies. ICICIdirect expects weak results from Sun Pharma due to continued pricing pressure in Taro portfolio and FDA issues at Halol plant and also Lupin due to competition in generic Fortamet and Glumetza, and Glenmark Pharma due to weak US growth on high base with Zetia exclusivity.

Overall, the firm expects the companies to report 5.5 percent revenue growth and 6.7 percent PAT decline YoY with EBITDA margin drop of 280bps.

The research firm is of the view that the Indian pharma market witnessed moderate growth, as the industry recovers from restocking post the implementation of GST, at average 7.3 percent in value terms for Oct-Nov’17. Secondary sales clearly indicate the value decline on YoY basis of 15.8 percent and 5.1 percent while growth on QoQ basis of 9.2 percent and 1.9 percent in portfolio under FDC and NLEM, respectively, due to FDC ban and price revision, respectively.

In terms of US generics, ICICIdirect expects Q3FY18 numbers to show moderate growth to decline in US sales. Sun Pharma, Lupin and Glenmark are expected to face pricing pressure in base business. Natco Pharma, Cadila Healthcare and Shilpa Medicare would benefit from product approvals. Stringent regulatory hurdles as USFDA cracks down on non-compliant facilities remains an overhang for new product approvals despite a healthy pending ANDA pipeline.

The key factors to observe in Q3FY18 numbers, according to the house would be growth of domestic business post GST and on low base due to demonetisation, update on USFDA issues plaguing several companies, continued pricing erosion in US business with consolidation of the buyers and increased competition, and growth in emerging markets after stabilisation of currencies and any working capital issues in these markets.

The US health regulator has accepted a new drug application (NDA) for an ophthalmic solution filed by Sun Pharma's wholly-owned subsidiary, the drugmaker said today.

""The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has accepted a new drug application (NDA), filed by its wholly owned subsidiary, for OTX-101 (cyclosporine A, ophthalmic solution),"" Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said in a BSE filing.

""OTX-101 is now under review for approval by the US FDA, marking an important developmental milestone for Sun Pharma's dry eye candidate,"" it added.

Sun Pharma MD Dilip Shanghvi said: ""OTX-101, a novel formulation of cyclosporine, will allow us to participate in the rapidly growing under-served and dynamic dry eye market. When approved, it will be a milestone for millions of dry eye patients across the globe that are yet to find relief for their condition.""

OTX-101 is being developed for global markets.

Sun Pharma said that post the USFDA approval, OTX-101 will be commercialised in the US by Sun Ophthalmics, the branded ophthalmics division of Sun Pharma's wholly owned subsidiary, which markets BromSite to eyecare practitioners across the US.

Shares of Sun Pharma were up 5.75 per cent at Rs 571.55 on the BSE."

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries has started recalling two batches of Riomet (metformin hydrochloride) Oral Solution voluntarily from the US market due to microbial contamination.

According to a notification put up by the US Food and Drug Administration in its website, the recall was initiated by the firm under 'Class-II' classification. The notification did not mention the quantity that is being recalled.

""The Riomet (Metformin Hydrochloride Oral Solution) has been found to be contaminated (with Scopulariopsis brevicaulis). The contamination was discovered during sample preparation for the Antimicrobial Preservative Effectiveness Testing (AMPET) being performed as part of the 12 month stability study interval,"" Sun Pharma informed the FDA in a letter.

Riomet (metformin oral solution) is an oral diabetes medicine that helps control blood sugar level.

According to the USA health regulator, Class II recall is a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.

The drug was manufactured for Ranbaxy Laboratories Inc Jacksonville in USA by a contract manufacturer and distributed by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries' subsidiary in Cranbury, New Jersey.

Centrum's research report on Sun Pharma

We maintain our Hold rating on Sun Pharma (SPIL) and maintain our TP of Rs490 based on 26x March’19E EPS of Rs18.7. SPIL’s Q2FY18 results were in-line with our expectations. The performance was impacted by the pricing pressure in the US and impact of GST in the domestic market. The drug maker’s revenue declined 20% YoY, margins narrowed 1,760bps to 20.7%, and net profit fell 60%. SPIL is facing supply constraints at its Halol facility. The management has guided for a single digit decline in revenue and EBIDTA margin of 20-22% for H2FY18. Key upside risks to our assumption include higher revenues from the US market and key downside risk includes regulatory risks for its manufacturing facilities catering to the global markets.

Outlook

We maintain our Hold rating on SPIL and maintain our TP to Rs490 based on 26x March’19 EPS of Rs18.7 and downside of 5.2% from the CMP. Key positive risks to our assumptions would be higher growth in the US market and key negative risk would be regulatory risks for its manufacturing facilities. We recommend a switch to Aurobindo or Cipla.

Sun Pharma on Friday said its US- based subsidiary is recalling two lots of diabetes drug Riomet due to microbial contamination. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc (SPII), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, is voluntarily recalling two lots of Riomet (Metformin Hydrochloride Oral Solution), to the retail level, the Mumbai-based drug major said in a statement.

The product is manufactured for SPII by a contract manufacturer, it said adding that the recall is being conducted with knowledge of the US FDA.

The Riomet has been found to be contaminated with microbe, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. The contamination was discovered during sample preparation for the antimicrobial preservative effectiveness testing (AMPET) being performed as part of the 12-month stability study interval, Sun Pharma said.

Use of contaminated Riomet potentially could result in a risk of infection, especially in the immunocompromised patient.

""To date, SPII has not received any reports of adverse events related to this recall,"" the company said. Riomet is indicated to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus in adult and children age 10 and above."

The November 13-17 week was a lacklustre one for pharma stocks. US approval of Cipla’s anti-asthma drug and Eris Lifesciences acquisition of Strides Shasun's India branded business were the highlights of the week. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Cadila Healthcare second quarter results were the major result announcements this week.

The BSE Healthcare index dropped 0.9% this week while the benchmark Sensex declined 0.16%. Cipla and Torrent Pharma were the biggest gainers in the pharma space, up 2.58% and 2.39%, respectively.

While Aurobindo Pharma and Cadila Healthcare were the biggest losers, down 5.13% and 3.8%, respectively. Other stocks that ended the week in the red include Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (-1.51%) Dr Reddy's Laboratories (-0.91%), Lupin (-0.89%), Glenmark Pharma (-0.27%) and Divi’s Laboratories (-0.16%)

Sun Pharma, India's largest drug maker, reported a 59% YoY decline in its net profit to Rs 912.1 crore in the second quarter ended September due to pricing pressure in the US generics market. Last year, the company benefitted by extending limited competition for its generic blood cancer drug imatinib in the US market.

Sun had reported a net profit of Rs 2,235 crore in the same period last year. Revenues declined 19.5 percent to Rs 6,650 crore as compared to Rs 8,260 crore in the year-ago period."

As many as 12 more drug companies, including Dr Reddy's, Sun Pharma and Glenmark, are likely to face probe, in addition to the six others, following complaints of ""artificially inflating prices"" of generics, according to Washington state Attorney General.

An official statement issued by Attorney General (AG) of Washington State, Bob Ferguson, yesterday said AGs of 45 other states, along with him, approached a federal court seeking to expand the pending complaint, increase the number of drug companies under probe to 18 from 6 and the number of affected drugs to 15 from 2.

The states alleged that the companies violated anti-trust laws to artificially inflate prices of the drugs and agreed to divide the market to reduce competition. Some of the drugs even saw a jump in price by more than 1,000 per cent.

""I hold powerful interests accountable when they don't play by the rules,"" Ferguson said.

The drug companies are facing the charge of conspiring to fix prices and keeping them elevated.

Previously, the suit named generic drug manufacturers Heritage Pharmaceuticals, Aurobindo Pharma USA, Citron Pharma, Mayne Pharma (USA), Mylan Pharmaceuticals and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA as defendants.

The states are seeking to expand the complaint to include Actavis Holdco US, Actavis Pharma, Ascend Laboratories, Apotex Corp, Dr Reddy's Laboratories (DRL), Emcure Pharmaceuticals, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Lannett Company, Par Pharmaceutical Companies Sandoz, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA).

Dr Reddy's said it is ""aware of the ongoing investigation by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) into this matter and the recent amended complaint issued by the Attorneys General of Connecticut and other states.

""The company intends to continue cooperating fully with all authorities on this matter and as it is sub-judice, wish to refrain from further comment at this point in time.""

Generic drugs, which enter the market after a name-brand drug manufacturer loses its exclusive patent rights, offer the prospects of lower prices and greater access to medication.

For drugs that attract a number of generic manufacturers, competition can bring down the average price by 80 per cent or more compared to brand-name alternatives. As a result, generics save consumers and the healthcare industry tens of billions of dollars annually, the statement said.

In 2015, generic drug sales in the United States were estimated at USD 74.5 billion. The generic pharmaceutical industry accounts for nearly 88 per cent of all prescriptions in the US.

In July 2014, the state of Connecticut started a probe -- later joined by other states -- into suspicious price increase of certain generics by up to 1,000 per cent or more, the statement said.

The investigation found evidence of direct conversation between company officials and marketing and sales executives through in-person meetings, phone calls, text messages and e- mails spanning over several years, in which they purportedly discussed efforts to fix and maintain prices, allocate markets and reduce competition for a number of generic drugs, it said.

The lawsuit also alleged that the companies knew their conduct was illegal as they often avoided communicating with each other in writing and, in some instances, intentionally deleted written communications and text messages, the AG said.

In a statement, Mylan said: ""We have been investigating these allegations thoroughly and have found no evidence of price fixing on the part of Mylan or its employees.

""We have asked the various attorneys general leading this case to share with us what information they believe supports these new allegations and, to date, they have not done so. Mylan has deep faith in the integrity of its President, Rajiv Malik, and stands behind him fully.""

The drugmaker added: ""Mylan takes its legal obligations seriously and operates with the highest levels of integrity and character. Mylan expects to have no further comment while the matter is pending.""

Comments from other companies were not immediately available.

The original complaint, filed on December 14, 2016, alleged that the companies entered into illegal conspiracies in order to unreasonably restrain trade, artificially inflate and manipulate prices and reduce competition in the United States for two drugs: doxycycline hyclate delayed release, an antibiotic, and glyburide, an oral diabetes medication.

The lawsuit was filed under seal in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

Portions of the complaint are edited in order to avoid compromising the states' ongoing investigation, the AG's statement added.

Assistant Attorneys General Erica Koscher and Michael Hemker are handling the case.

In addition to Washington, other states involved in the lawsuit include Connecticut, Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware and the District of Columbia, the statement said."

Forty-six US state attorneys general will seek to expand a lawsuit alleging price fixing of generic drugs to 18 companies and 15 medicines on Tuesday, including Novartis AG's generic unit Sandoz and India-based Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, people familiar with the matter said.

The original complaint, being litigated in federal court in Pennsylvania, describes an industry-wide conspiracy in which companies divide up the market as a way to push up prices.

In the amended complaint, the number of generic drug manufacturers named goes from six to 18, including Endo International PLC's unit Par Pharmaceutical, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Apotex, Glenmark Generics Ltd and Lannett Company Inc, the sources said.

Big players in the multi-billion dollar generic drug industry stand accused of conspiring to boost prices in a marketplace in which consumers assume they are buying lower-priced versions of widely used drugs.

Two senior executives from drug companies alleged to have engaged in the illegal conduct are also being sued, the sources said.

Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen is leading the coalition of states. A news conference announcing the expanded lawsuit has been scheduled for 11 a.m. (1500 GMT) in Connecticut.

The new complaint will address the relationships between such parties as wholesalers, distributors, large pharmacies and supermarkets, the sources said, adding that it will also cover the agreements with manufacturers to keep prices high.

The previous lawsuit, filed in December, had focused on Mylan NV, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and four other companies. It had centered on just two medicines: a delayed-release version of a common antibiotic, doxycycline hyclate; and glyburide, an older drug used to treat diabetes.

The amended complaint expands the number of drugs to include glipizide-metformin and glyburide-metformin, which are among the most commonly used diabetes treatments, the sources said.

Others include: acetazolamide, which is used to treat glaucoma and epilepsy; the antibiotic doxycycline monohydrate; and the blood pressure medicine fosinopril. Others are the anxiety medicine meprobamate and the calcium channel blocking agent nimodipine, the sources said."

Drug major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries on Tuesday said it has identified speciality segment as one of the key drivers for growth going forward.

The global pharmaceutical landscape is rapidly changing. There are opportunities as well as challenges. This mandates identifying new and profitable growth drivers in order to generate consistent shareholder value, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries MD Dilip Shanghvi said at the company's AGM.

""We have identified the speciality segment as one such driver which can help us transition up the value chain,"" he added.

The company's speciality initiatives target the global market with the US being one of the important markets, Shanghvi said.

""Our strategy entails building a pipeline of patented products for global markets with a focus on improving patient outcomes either by targeting unmet medical needs or by enhancing patient convenience through differentiated dosage forms,"" he added.

For the year under review, Sun Pharma significantly enhanced its global speciality pipeline through acquisitions and partnerships and made substantial progress in successfully completing clinical trials for key products, Shanghvi said.

The company now has four commercialised speciality products in the US market, he added.

""We have started investing in building the speciality teams in the US and towards establishing the requisite front-end infrastructure,"" Shanghvi said.

While these investments currently do not generate commensurate revenues streams, they will augur well for the company in the long term as more speciality products get commercialised, he added."

By Satish Gupta of astrostocktips.in

Today’s planetary position: Moon will be transiting in Taurus. Jupiter in Libra, Sun, Mars & Mercury in Leo. Lord Saturn in Scprpio. Lord Rahu & Venus in Cancer. Ketu in Capricorn. Pluto in Sagittarius. Neptune in Aquarius & Uranus in Pisces.

Be cautious: Planet Jupiter will be changing the house from Virgo to Libra on September 12, 2017. It stays in one house for 12 months (approximately). Many sectors, which were out performing till now due to their stay in the preceding houses will stop getting planetary support & would not out perform as they have done till now & many new sectors would start receiving support & out shine.

Jupiter is a planet of wisdom. It has direct link with trading/investment in stock market. It is quite possible that sectors which were profitable to an individual up till now may not suitable for trading/investment after the change. It may also be possible that trading in stock market may not be favourable/profitable after the change, depending on its position in individual horoscope.

Rahukal time: -13.30 – 15.00

Following sectors will be receiving astrological support:

Pharma: Divis Labs, Lupin, Aurobindo Pharma, Strides Shasun, Wockhrdt, Sun Pharma, etc.

To identify and buy such stocks at right time and exit at right time. Timing is most crucial element in investing or trading. This timing can be known through Financial Astrology. Astrology is only science which can predict future correctly & guide us about sectors which have to outperform.

Every year with commencement of new Samvat (Hindu New Year), astrologically, based on planetary position, certain new sectors start getting strong astrological support & start outperforming, while some others sectors which were performing earlier start underperforming. Some sectors/stock remains laggard. Stocks of astrological supported sectors outperform resulting in exorbitant gains irrespective of market behaviour, either bull market or bear market.

Predicting bullish sectors of next Samvat 2074

Every year we release sectors of new Samvat in the month of March/April when new Samvat starts. But this year, we shall prepone release of next Samvat sectors, which are going to get strong astrological support & stocks from those sector outperform markets. Purpose of releasing sectors of next Samvat earlier is that investors & traders should get maximum advantage of down trend of markets by good timing.

We firmly believe that these special astrological positions present very unique opportunities to investors and traders both. This opportunity, if utilised properly, can safeguard your existing portfolio and simultaneously optimise your future investments and trading also. Successful investing and trading is all about good timing only.

Needless to mention our innumerable past predictions, where most stocks from the SECTORS of SAMVAT gave exorbitant returns & certain stocks appreciated by over 500 percent

During current Samavat 2073 among other sectors – dyes/chemical/sugar sector received strong astrological support & outperformed and gave exorbitant return. Many stocks from dyes/ chemical sector appreciated by over 500 percent.

Sectors which get very strong astrological support are not normally affected by downfall in the market.

People indulging in the stock market are often people with a lot of emotions. They get excited by something new, especially if it holds the promise of making them a whole lot richer and provides bragging rights at their next social gathering.

Maybe that’s why amateur and professionals alike tend to lose their minds in bull markets, particularly when a hot initial public offering, or IPO, is offered to them by their broker.

On one hand, had you bought into the IPOs of Infosys (yes, remember?), HDFC Bank, Sun Pharma, or TCS, you would have had some volatile price fluctuations along the way, but there is no question that you have made enough money to substantially change the quality of your life. Clearly, a well chosen IPO can be a life changing experience if you simply make the right choice and stick with the stock for years.

On the other hand, there is a large majority of IPOs such as those of Reliance Power, Suzlon and DLF, which have destroyed investors’ capital. With such businesses, even the “long-term” cannot save you from permanent capital destruction.

The Truth about IPOs

Benjamin Graham wrote in The Intelligent Investor…

In every case, investors have burned themselves on IPOs, have stayed away for at least two years, but have always returned for another scalding. For as long as stock markets have existed, investors have gone through this manic-depressive cycle.

In America’s first great IPO boom back in 1825, a man was said to have been squeezed to death in the stampede of speculators trying to buy shares in the new Bank of Southwark. The wealthiest buyers hired thugs to punch their way to the front of the line. Sure enough, by 1829, stocks had lost roughly 25% of their value.

Over my 11 years of experience in the stock markets, I have rarely come across any IPO that has been launched keeping in mind the interest of investors.

A majority of them have been launched in the form of ‘legalized looting’ by company promoters and their investment bankers.

I have come to believe how Graham defined IPOs in The Intelligent Investor. He said that intelligent investors should conclude that IPO does not stand only for ‘initial public offering’. More accurately, it is a shorthand for…

It’s Probably Overpriced, or

Imaginary Profits Only, or even

Insiders’ Private Opportunity

3 Reasons to Avoid IPOs

There is an old saying in corporate circles. One should raise money when it is available rather than when it is needed. This is the reason most companies come out with their IPOs during rising or bull markets when money is aplenty.

Unfortunately, most investors in these IPOs come out on the losing end of the equation.

Granted, some IPO deals are good for retail investors, but I’d argue the odds of that happening are stacked against you.

The stock market regulator SEBI’s rules that are designed to protect Indian IPO investors, generate reams of disclosures about the company and the offering process but unfortunately, many investors neither read nor understand these.

After all, how many people have the time or inclination to read 400-500 pages of IPO offer documents? And then they say – “Please read the offer document carefully before investing.”

IPOs are not level playing fields, I believe. This game is stacked heavily against the small investor who is lured into the hype and then often loses a large part of his savings betting on listing gains.

Here are 3 reasons I believe small investors must avoid IPOs and rather search for great businesses among those already listed –

1. IPOs are Expensive

People assume an IPO is an opportunity to “get in at lower prices”. In reality, by the time you buy shares of a company in its IPO, other parties have almost always invested earlier at lower prices – often, much lower prices.

Before you even knew about the company, there probably were three or four rounds of private investment, and the per-share price of ownership usually goes up with each round.

In fact, one of the big incentives for an IPO is so that previous investors – founders, venture capital firms, large individual investors – can “cash out” at least a portion of what they’ve invested.

That is why most IPOs are often expensively priced. They are not priced to offer you a piece of the business at cheap or reasonable prices, but to find “bigger fools” who can get in when the “privileged few” are getting out.

Don’t believe the investment bankers when they say that IPOs are “cheap and attractive”. Their incentive lies in first fixing the IPO price (whatever the promoter wants) and then working backward to justify the same.

2. IPOs Create Vividness Bias

It’s important to understand that the investment bankers and underwriters of IPO are simply salesmen.

The whole IPO process is intentionally hyped up to get as much attention as possible. Since IPOs only happen once for each company, they are often presented as “once in a lifetime” opportunities for the promoters and other large shareholders to cash out.

'Make sure there's still a sucker born ever minute before we launch our new IPO.'

Promoters and investment bankers thus create stories that are “vivid” – by using terms like “listing gains”, “bright future”, “long-term story” – and entice you to believe them as soon as you hear them.

You must avoid getting charmed by that vividness.

Try to go behind the beauty of that vividness, and scrutinize the IPO to see if it is really so bright and beautiful.

In other words, you need to get past the “bright and shiny” stuff that surrounds IPOs because it’s easy to fall into the trap given that so many others around you are falling for the same.

Don’t buy a stock only because it’s an IPO – do it because it’s a good investment.

3. IPOs Underperform

Most people who get onto the IPO bandwagon often look at the listing or short term gains they can make in the next few weeks and months. In bull markets, this often happens.

However, if you consider the long term performance of IPOs, most of them underperform their peers and the general market – simply because they started off with high valuations.

As you can see in the chart below, the BSE-IPO index has underperformed both the BSE-30 and BSE-200 indices ever since this index was launched in 2004.

So much for the hype!Final Word

Here are some thoughts on IPOs from a few of the investing legends…

Warren Buffett wrote in his 1993 letter…

[An] intelligent investor in common stocks will do better in the secondary market than he will do buying new issues…[IPO] market is ruled by controlling stockholders and corporations, who can usually select the timing of offerings or, if the market looks unfavourable, can avoid an offering altogether. Understandably, these sellers are not going to offer any bargains, either by way of public offering or in a negotiated transaction.

When Buffett issued Class-B shares of Berkshire, he made sure that it wasn’t a typical IPO. He wrote in his 1997 letter…

Our issuance of the B shares not only arrested the sale of the trusts, but provided a low-cost way for people to invest in Berkshire if they still wished to after hearing the warnings we issued. To blunt the enthusiasm that brokers normally have for pushing new issues—because that’s where the money is—we arranged for our offering to carry a commission of only 1½%, the lowest payoff that we have ever seen in common stock underwriting. Additionally, we made the amount of the offering open-ended, thereby repelling the typical IPO buyer who looks for a short-term price spurt arising from a combination of hype and scarcity.

The dot com crash of 2000 was preceded by hundreds of IPOs where the underlying business was literally nonexistent. In his 2001 letter, Buffett wrote…

The fact is that a bubble market has allowed the creation of bubble companies, entities designed more with an eye to making money off investors rather than for them. Too often, an IPO, not profits, was the primary goal of a company’s promoters. At bottom, the “business model” for these companies has been the old-fashioned chain letter, for which many fee-hungry investment bankers acted as eager postmen.

Benjamin Graham wrote in Chapter 6 of The Intelligent Investor…

Our one recommendation is that all investors should be wary of new issues—which means, simply, that these should be subjected to careful examination and unusually severe tests before they are purchased. There are two reasons for this double caveat. The first is that new issues[IPO] have special salesmanship behind them, which calls therefore for a special degree of sales resistance. The second is that most new issues are sold under “favorable market conditions”—which means favorable for the seller and consequently less favorable for the buyer.

Charlie Munger said this in Berkshire’s 2004 meeting…

It is entirely possible that you could use our mental models to find good IPOs to buy. There are countless IPOs every year, and I’m sure that there are a few cinches that you could jump on. But the average person is going to get creamed. So if you’re talented, good luck.

To which Buffett added…

An IPO is like a negotiated transaction – the seller chooses when to come public – and it’s unlikely to be a time that’s favorable to you. So, by scanning 100 IPOs, you’re way less likely to find anything interesting than scanning an average group of 100 stocks.

Buffett also said…

It’s almost a mathematical impossibility to imagine that, out of the thousands of things for sale on a given day, the most attractively priced is the one being sold by a knowledgeable seller (company insiders) to a less-knowledgeable buyer (investors).

The late Mr. Parag Parikh wrote in his book, Value Investing and Behaviour Finance…

It’s safe to conclude that IPOs, which seem like a good investment vehicle are, in reality, not so. In fact, an IPO is a product which is against investor interest, as it is mostly offered to investors when they are willing to pay a higher and outrageous valuation in boom times.

Prof. Sanjay Bakshi wrote this in a 2000 article …

Any kind of rational comparison of long-term returns in the IPO market and the secondary market would show that investors do far better in the latter than in the former…IPOs are one of the surest ways of losing money in the long run.

Four characteristics of the IPO market makes it a market where it is far more profitable to be a seller than to be a buyer. First, in the IPO market, there are many buyers and only a handful of sellers. Second, the sellers, being insiders, always know more about the company whose shares are to be sold, than the buyers. Third, the sellers hold an extremely valuable option of deciding the timing of the sale. Naturally, they would choose to sell only when they get high prices for the shares. Finally, the quantity of shares being offered is flexible and can be “managed” by the merchant bankers to attain the optimum price from the sellers’ viewpoint.

But, what is “optimum” from the sellers’ viewpoint is not the “optimum” from the buyers’ viewpoint. This is an important point to note: Companies want to raise capital at the lowest possible cost, which from their viewpoint means issuance of shares at high prices. That is why bull markets are always accompanied by a surge in the issuance of shares.

You get the message, right?

It’s important to remember that, while most are, not every IPO is bad. It’s just that the base rate of investing in an IPO is not in favour of the small investor, and thus you must assess every investment opportunity on its own merit.

Hype and excitement don’t necessarily equate to a good investment opportunity. If stocks continue to climb like they have over the past few months, and the IPO line lengthens, I’m afraid you’ll have plenty of opportunities to see that I’m right.

For pharmaceutical stocks, this past week was one of the worst - many have sunk on weak Q1 results due to destocking of channel on account of GST rollout and US pricing pressures. The weak global cues also didn't help the matters.

The news highlights in the sector include first quarter results of Sun Pharma, Aurobindo Pharma, Cipla, Cadila Healthcare among others. The US pricing pressure looks more structural than a temporary event.

How did Pharma Index Perform?

The BSE Healthcare index declined 8.13 percent in the past week, while the benchmark Sensex dropped 4.04 percent.

None of the big pharma stocks have seen gains this past week.

Sun Pharma (-11.13 percent), Cadila Healthcare (-11.35 percent), Glenmark (-10.99 percent) and Dr Reddy's (-10.37 percent) have lost one-tenth of their market value. Natco Pharma (-26.05 percent) was worst hit shedding almost a quarter of its value.

The rest of the pack saw huge dips of their share prices.

Lupin (-5.3 percent), Cipla (-4.79 percent), Aurobindo Pharma (-3.98 percent), Divis (-8.36 percent), Torrent Pharma (-4.81 percent) and Biocon (4.61 percent).

Here's What Kept the Sector Buzzing:

Sun Pharma, India's largest drug maker reported Rs crore 425 loss in Q1 impacted by steep pricing pressure, GST and one-time write-off.The company said thing could see improvement in second half. The company also said it had completed remedial measures and is awaiting US re-inspection of its critical Halol facility.

http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/sun-pharma-says-it-sought-re-inspection-of-its-halol-facility-awaiting-us-fda-response-2358227.html

Aurobindo Pharma, India's third largest drug maker posted a 11.4 percent decline in net profit to Rs 518.5 crore for the first quarter ended June FY18 with flat US generics sales and drop in revenues of API and anti-retrovirals impacting the bottomline, despite surge in Europe business.The company reported a net profit of Rs 585 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The revenues declined 2.3 percent to Rs 3678.75 crore for the quarter ended June.

Cipla was one of very few companies that was able to wither the storm. The company posted 21 percent rise in net profit to Rs 409 crores on a year-on-year basis for the first quarter ended June 30 reigning in expenses and enhancing operational efficiency.

Sun Pharma, India's largest drug maker on Friday said it has completed remediation exercise at its Halol plant in Gujarat and made a request to the US FDA for re-inspection.

“The remedial steps to address these observations are now complete and we are now awaiting a re-inspection by the US FDA,” said Dilip Shanghvi, Managing Director of Sun Pharma in the company’s earnings call.

“Till we have a successful outcome from the re-inspection we will not get any approvals from this facility,” Shanghvi added.

Shanghvi said the drug maker is giving top priority to bring back Halol unit under compliance.

The US FDA re-inspected the Halol facility from November 17, 2016 through December 1, 2016 and issued nine Form 483 observations.

Halol is an important plant for the company and contributed 10-15 percent to its US sales before the factory received a warning letter from the US FDA for violation of manufacturing norms in December 2015.

The warning letter blocked new product approval from that facility impacting the company’s US business.

“We are in the process of shifting some of the products filed from the Halol to alternate sites as a risk mitigation measure,” Shanghvi said.

In the first quarter of FY18—US sales declined 42 percent to USD 351 million due to pricing pressure and delay of new approvals of important products from Halol facility.

US sales account 37 percent of overall sales of the company. Shanghvi maintained that FY18 is likely to be a challenging year for the company with an expectation of a single digit decline in consolidated revenue.

The company EBITDA margin stood at 17 percent in the first quarter.

“As move forward in the coming quarters, we expect our business to improve. We expect a gradual improvement in EBITDA margin from base of Q1 and reaching approximately to 20-22 percent in the second half of this year,” Shanghvi said.

Shanghvi added that the margin guidance doesn't factor any approvals from Halol facility.

The company is expected to get USD 300 million synergy benefit from Ranbaxy acquisition.

The synergy benefit will be used to fund company’s evolving speciality business, Sun Pharma said."

Tracking the weakness in markets, as more than 200 stocks hit fresh 52-week low on the BSE.

Stocks which slipped to fresh 52-week low on the BSE include names like Dr Reddy’s, Crisil, Amara Raja Batteries, SIS, Zensar Technologies, Orissa Mineral Development Company, SML Isuzu Ltd, PI Industries, Glenmark Pharma, Sun Pharma, Ipca Labs, Tata Motors, Coal India etc. among others.

The S&P BSE Sensex has already plunged over 1,400 points in a matter of days from its record high of 32,686.48 recorded just last month.

Indian market came under pressure this week on geopolitical concerns as a war of words between the US and North Korea continues to keep investors on tenterhooks. Back home, concerns over SEBI list of shell companies led to massive deleveraging in the small and midcap space.

“The July rally seen in Nifty was to a certain extent due to short covering. The recent Geo-political tension between the USA & N.Korea and that of India & China is leading to selling pressure in the market,” Rusmik Oza, Head – Midcaps, Kotak Securities told Moneycontrol.

The market lacks any positive trigger as most of them have played out, the last being the RBI rate cut. The majority of the mid & small caps earnings are below expectations, mainly due to the impact of GST implementation, suggest experts.

Oza further added with more than 20 percent correction in stocks prices margin calls get triggered leading to unwinding of position. To support loss making positions clients are forced to exit in stronger companies that lead to a cascading effect across the market.

The Nifty saw a gap down the opening of more than 100 points which took it closer to its crucial support level of 9710. Tracking the weakness in the market, over 190 stocks hit a fresh 52-week low on the NSE.

Stocks which slipped to fresh 52-week low include names like Blue Dart, Kewal Kiran, Dr. Reddy’s, Zensar Technologies, Crisil, TTK Healthcare, PI Industries, Glenmark Pharma, Wockhardt, Eris Lifesciences, Sun Pharma, Ipca Laboratories etc. among others.

The correction in the market was largely on expected lines because a lot of momentum indicators were giving signs of the market getting overheated. The ‘RSI’ oscillator has also turned southwards from its strong resistance of 76 – 80 zone on the weekly chart, which doesn’t bode well for the Bulls.

“At the current juncture, the index has strong support around 9710 levels, which is 61.80% retracement level of the recent rally on the daily chart,” Jay Purohit, Technical & Derivatives Analyst at Centrum Broking Limited told Moneycontrol.

“From the last couple of days, enormous profit booking was seen in many stocks and thus, traders are advised to be very cautious and need to be selective while picking a stock,” he said.

Purohit further added that going forward, traders should not look for buying opportunities in the index as the ongoing corrective move may extend towards 9710 – 9650 levels. On the flip side, strong resistance for the index is placed at 9900 and 9990 levels, he said."

Pharma stocks fell for third consecutive session Friday, especially after Teva missed earnings estimates and Biocon received 10 observations from USFDA for its Bengaluru unit.

Largecaps like Sun Pharma, Lupin, Aurobindo Pharma and Dr Reddy's Labs lost up to 4 percent while Biocon shares fell more than 9 percent intraday.

Among midcaps, Cadila Healthcare, Strides Shasun, Glenmark Pharma and Torrent Pharma were also down between 2-4 percent intraday.

The Nifty Pharma index, itself, lost as much as 2.5 percent today, taking the total fall to 4.3 percent for three straight days.

Firstly, Lupin and Dr Reddy's Labs Q1 numbers disappointed the street, with Lupin management in its concall on Thursday said US business would see a double-digit decline in FY18 and revised EBITDA margin guidance downwards to 21-23 percent from 24-26 percent.

Secondly, Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries tanked 24 percent in US trade on Thursday as it missed estimates for both earnings per share and revenue, interim CEO Yitzhak Peterburg blamed the poor performance on a saturation of the US generic drug market.

Teva reported a loss of USD 6 billion in June quarter against profit of USD 188 million in same quarter last year and operating loss stood at USD 5.7 billion against operating income of USD 0.4 billion YoY. However, revenue increased 13 percent to USD 5.68 billion YoY.

Thirdly, Biocon received 10 observations from the US Food and Drug Administration for its Bengaluru unit after inspection between May 25 and June 3. The same facility in March-April had received 8 observations in biolsimilar inspection.

Pushkaraj Sham KanitkarGEPL Capital

The index after a lot of struggle, successfully crossed the milestone of 10,000 mark in the week gone by.

The Nifty50 made an all-time high at 10,114.85 on the expiry day, but we have seen some profit booking coming through in the last session as it closed at 10,014.50, still up by 99.25 points or 1 percent for the week.

The index maintains its Higher Top and Higher Bottom formation in all the time frames such as Daily, Weekly, and Monthly.

For the week ahead, the index seems to be in a fix. If Index breaches the recent high of 10,115, then immediate resistance level stands at extrapolated levels 10,200 – 10,350 level in the near future.

On the flip side, the index may witness further profit booking below the 9,820 – 9,770 mark (previous Swing Low) with intermediate supports placed at 9,700-9,650, mark which is an earlier breakout level.

Here is a list of top five stocks which can give up to 17% return in the short term:

Reliance Capital: BUY| Target Rs845| Stop Loss Rs667| Return 17%

In a previous week, the stock entered in a Bullish orbit with a forming of a big Bullish candle on the daily as well as on the weekly charts with huge volume confirmation.

The stock has also registered a 52-week high that also corresponds to a multi week, multi month breakout.

The weekly relative strength index (RSI) indicator is placed at around 67 mark which indicates that there is a still a good amount of space on the upside in the medium term.

On the daily chart, the momentum oscillator like ADX is located at 22 with directionally upward bias.

We expect the current rally of the stock will continue till Rs800 – 845 in the medium term and the stop loss for the same may be maintained at Rs667.

CESC (930.7): BUY| Target Rs1039| Stop Loss Rs900| Return 11%

The stock gave a breakout above the 2-months consolidation pattern, both on the daily as well as on the weekly charts.

In last trading session, the stock has formed a Bullish Engulfing candlestick pattern on the daily chart with volume confirmation which is a strong positive signal for the near future.

We have seen that the medium term 13 (898) & 34 (892) exponential moving averages have remained positively aligned since the last 2 weeks on the daily charts, which is an add-on cause for the current bullish momentum to sustain.

We project the upside of this move to last at least till Rs995 – 1039 in weeks to come. The stop for the trade should ideally be placed a bit below the Rs900 mark.

Kaveri Seed Company (683.5): BUY| Target Rs780| Stop Loss Rs647| Return 14%

In the previous week, the stock made a 52-weeks high at Rs688.4 mark. The stock has given a Flag pattern breakout on the Daily chart with volume confirmation which is a price continuation breakout pattern.

We have seen that from the last couple of days, the delivery volumes have surged sharply, with the delivery percentage rising to 44 percent which is above the normal level, which indicates genuine buying in the scrip.

The Bulls seem to be more confident about the upward move of the stock. The daily RSI indicator placed at around 65 marks which show the strong positive momentum built up for the near future.

We expect a move onto Rs738 from current levels, which if crossed further may move onto 780. A stop loss may be placed at Rs647.

Ashok Leyland (109.4): BUY| Target Rs 124| Stop Loss Rs106| Return 13%

The stock has maintained a bullish sequence of Higher Top Higher Bottom formation on the daily as well as on the weekly charts.

In the last week, the Stock created a 52-weeks high placed at Rs109.9 and closed near that level which is a positive sign for the current momentum.

In the last trading session, the stock has given an ATR breakout on the daily chart which indicates strong positive structure is intact.

The daily RSI oscillator is placed at Rs67 level with a positive crossover which is add-on cause for current bullish momentum to sustain.

We expect, if price sustains above Rs113 (All Time High) then it would further move up around 7% - 10%. The stop maybe placed a bit below the 106 mark.

Sun Pharma (550.8): SELL| Target Rs465| Stop Loss Rs593| Return 15%

We have seen that the stock made a 52-weeks low placed at Rs492.65 mark in June 2017 and bounced back till 591.5 within 7-weeks.

But, in the last week, the stock formed a big Bearish candle and breached the low of past couple of weeks which is again a negative sign for the near future.

We have seen that the medium term 13 (576) & 34 (625) exponential moving averages have remained negatively aligned since last 9 months on weekly charts, which is add-on cause for current bearish momentum to sustain.

The prices are on course for a correction to the 52-week low around the Rs492 mark. We feel this may lead to the Rs480-465 levels further down.

The bearish view would stand negated only on a closing above the Rs593 mark.

The Nifty closed above its crucial resistance level of 10,000 for the first time on Wednesday and made a bullish candle on the daily candlestick charts negating bearish belt hold pattern formed in the previous trading session.

Thursday happens to be the expiry day for July F&O contracts. The outcome of the US Fed meeting could well decide the fate of 10,000-level on Nifty. A more hawkish Fed could well lead to index testing its support levels.

The Nifty closed above 10,000 for the first time ever at 10,020.7 on Wednesday. According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 9,982.43, followed by 9,944.17. If the index starts to move higher, key resistance levels to watch out are 10,042.48 and 10,064.27.

The Nifty Bank closed 150 points higher at 24670.70 on Wednesday. Important Pivot level, which will act as crucial support for the index, is placed at 24530.1, followed by 24389.5. On the upside, key resistance level is 24766.1, followed by 24861.5.

According to Technical Analyst Prakash Gaba of prakashgaba.com, support for Nifty is placed at 9920 and resistance at 10036-69 while Bank Nifty has support at 24500 and resistance at 24775.

Q) What are your views on the market which has already delivered about 20% return so far in the year 2017? How is the second half of the year expected to pan out? Do you think it is time for investors to book some profits and buy again on dips?

A) We remain cautiously optimistic on markets. First half has been very strong owing to positive macro fundamentals (inflation trending down, stable currency, twin deficits under control) and policy reforms (GST) coupled with very benign liquidity (1HCY17 FII equity inflows are more than inflows of CY15+CY16, 1HCY17 DII MF inflows are already approaching the DII MF flows of entire CY16).

Upside from here will be a function of earnings recovery – unless strong macro translates into equally strong micro, valuation re-rating from these levels look slightly difficult.

We expect earnings growth to pick up the pace from 2HFY18 owing to the low base of demonetization, re-stocking in consumption sectors post GST implementation and transmission of lower interest rates in the P&L of corporate India.

Timing the markets is always fraught with difficulties, we advise investors to invest systematically over a period of time.

Q) Your list of top five stocks (with rationale) which could turn out to be multibaggers in the next 2-3 years?

A) Predicting multi-baggers in advance is tough. However, we like following themes and sectors in the market today:

Private Banks: Shift from physical to financial assets coupled with value migration from public to private sector banks provide multiple years of visibility for earnings growth. Our top ideas include HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, Yes Bank, RBL.

Consumption: The consumption opportunity in India is sizeable and there are multiple ways to play this opportunity. GST implementation will hasten the shift towards organized players and benefit multiple categories.

We like discretionary Consumption themes and prefer companies like Titan, Pidilite, Tata Motors, Crompton Consumer, Amara Raja.

Pharmaceuticals: Most of the negatives around regulatory issues, base price erosion in the US, buyer consolidation in the US are known and are in the price. The sector is trading at a 12% discount to its average multiples.

While near term could be challenging, we believe it offers a good entry point from a medium to long term perspective. We like Sun Pharma, Aurobindo Pharma, and Jubilant Life.

Q) Gush of liquidity has already pushed markets across the globe to fresh highs. What are your views on global markets and experts say that a big correction in India market can only be triggered if there is a global trigger? What are your views?

A) Global triggers for correction are difficult to foresee but tightening of liquidity globally can have implications for India and other emerging markets.

However, we believe that globally lot of capital is still sitting on very low-interest rates and will always be hunting for yields till interest rates remain soft.

Q) What are your views on the companies which have reported results for the quarter ended June so far. Do you think the numbers are largely on expected lines? A recent poll did by Moneycontrol highlighted that analysts expect more downgrades than upgrades this quarter?

A) So far the numbers declared by the companies have been in line with expectations. For the 28 companies in our MOSL universe which have declared results so far, PAT growth has come in at 7.7% vs. expectations of 8% while EBITDA growth of 9.3% if bang in-line with estimates.

More than the number, we will be keenly watching the commentary of companies on GST implementation and any teething troubles, consumer demand, de-stocking/re-stocking as it will have implications for the rest of FY18 earnings growth for broader markets even as Nifty remains relatively insulated from GST impact.

Q) How are you seeing ITC stocks after a recent increase in cess by the government? Do you think the smart money will move out of ITC to other stocks like HUL, Britannia etc?

A) Some re-allocation of flows within the sector is a possibility given the sharp outperformance of ITC in recent months. Fundamentally, the U-turn on Cigarette taxation has created fresh headwinds for ITC in terms of Cig volume and EBIT growth from near term perspective and could lead to some de-rating.

On the other hand, strong rural consumption outlook owing to good monsoons, 7th pay commission awards, best in five year MSP hike and farm loan waiver will be positive for other consumer names like Britannia, Emami, Dabur, Colgate, and HUL.

Q) Investors grapple with fear of investing at peak. What do you tell your clients to calm their fears?

A) Peaks and bottoms are known only in hindsight. Systematic investments in fundamentally sound companies with growing addressable market, good pricing power which accords earnings visibility, high-quality managements and reasonable entry valuations is a strong antidote to overcome the fear of investing at peak.

Q) If somebody comes with you with a monthly investment of Rs15000-20000 to realise his crorepati dream. Can he realise his dream by investing in direct equities or it is better to go via MF route? What is minimum capital required to start trading?

A) It is better to go via mutual fund route if one is not equipped to spend enough time in the market and understand the various nuances of investing. Fortunes have been made in Indian equity markets with patient and long term investing in good quality companies bought at reasonable price.

Time spent in the market is far more important than timing the market. There is no minimum capital required for trading. It depends on one’s disposable income and risk appetite.

Q) Any particular instance you recall when you were interacting with your clients which were funny or made you think twice about the problem or taught you something?

A) One thing which interacting with a diverse set of clients has taught me is that Investing by looking at one year forward P/E is a sure shot way of missing multi-year compounders and eventually potential multi-baggers.

Second, patience in investing and ability to think away from the herd is something which is easier to preach but tough to practice.

Q) Do you relate any particular Hollywood sitcom with the market? For example, some analysts have related Game of Throne with US markets while some have written on investment lessons from movie Bahubali. Do you also relate stock market to any movie or a serial?

A) I relate to the stock market to a test match in cricket where one has to survive tough sessions and stay at the crease long enough to create records and take the team through to victory.

In test cricket a batsman has to be patient, bide his time when the bowler is in his elements in hostile condition and protect his wicket before scoring runs. Similarly in investments, one has to first avoid capital loss before thinking of multi-baggers.

Q) What are your views on the upcoming Fed meeting next week and RBI policy meet in the month of August? Do you see Fed raising rates in the upcoming policy meet or RBI reducing rates next month?

A) Predicting Macros is always difficult, more so when there are multiple moving parts and global liquidity is abundant. That said, we think RBI may decide to cut rates given the well-entrenched moderation in CPI print and continued stable currency dynamics. As far as Fed is concerned, we will be more interested in knowing the future course of normalizing its balance sheet."

It is time to be stock specific, maybe that’s the approach mutual fund managers are taking right now at a time when the market trades near record highs. The Nifty50 which has come off slightly from its record high but has gained over 17 percent so far in the year 2017.

Fund managers remained selective when they shopped for stocks in the month of May. They remained net buyers in 65 percent of the Nifty50 stocks, Motilal Oswal said in a report.

Stocks in which funds have more than 2 percent stake include names like Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, Power Grid, Infosys, TCS, L&T, State Bank of India, ITC, M&M, ICICI Bank, Eicher Motors etc. among others.

Among the Nifty50 names, highest net buying in the month of May on a month-on-month (MoM) basis was witnessed in Vedanta (up 27 percent), Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 17 percent) and Tech Mahindra (up 17 percent).

The Equity asset under management (AUM) rose for the sixth consecutive month in May to scale a new high of Rs 5.2 trillion, highlighted the report.

In the month of May, MFs showed interest in private banks, metals, consumer, technology, auto and infrastructure — these sectors saw a MoM increase in weights.

Among the Nifty50 names, top conviction buys include names like HDFC Bank where almost 19 funds have more than 2 percent exposure, followed by ICICI Bank with 16 funds having an exposure of 2 percent and 12 funds have exposure to State Bank of India.

Almost 5 funds have exposure in both Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC while 4 funds have exposure in Yes Bank and 3 funds have holdings in Axis Bank.

Rate sensitive stocks have been fund managers’ darling in the last few months especially private sector banks. Private Banks sectoral weight rose 17.3 percent which as the top sector holding in May, followed by Auto (10.7 percent), Capital Goods (8.7 percent) and NBFC (7 percent).

“Since banks are a play on the economy, they can sustain earnings growth for a long time. Particularly, ICICI Bank is attractively valued while HDFC and Kotak are high-quality stocks that have a track record of delivering superior returns,” Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

Among the IT or technology sector names Infosys remained in the spotlight. Despite global headwinds which have contracted margin for some of the top IT companies, almost 11 funds have holdings of more than 2 percent in Infosys while for TCS it is just 1 fund.

Mutual funds are betting on stocks which have good earnings visibility are stocks from sectors like IT and pharma which are facing some headwinds are valued very low.

Some quality names in both these segments are available at attractive valuations which are attracting smart money into these stocks.

“Clarity from Managements of IT majors on underperformance has helped to rope in some Bargain Hunters into the sector,” Rajesh Shanbhag, Advisory Head – Alternate Channels, Way2Wealth Brokers Pvt. Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“However, Indian Prime Minister’s meet with US President which is scheduled for this month-end will be closely watched where the H1 B VISA issue is to be addressed,” he said."

Leading healthcare stocks like Lupin, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's Labs etc, which have larger proportion of US business in their revenues, dropped up to 6 percent intraday Friday after a media report indicated of likely new US order to lower drug costs in the US.

President Donald Trump's administration is preparing an executive order aimed at lowering US drug costs and officials in the administration will meet later today, Bloomberg said quoting people familiar with the matter.

According to a report, one policy being discussed is support for value-based agreement, in which pharma companies and health insurers develop arrangements to pay for products depending on how well the work.

Sharekhan said this move could further create pricing pressure and hurt Indian companies that are already facing regulatory issues and currency woes.

The research house continued to remain cautious on the sector.

Meanwhile, Ipca Labs was the biggest loser among pharma stocks, especially after the USFDA said all drugs manufactured from Ratlam, Indore and Piparria manufacturing facilities will be refused admission into the United States.

API Chloroquine phosphate, however, is an exception as the drug will be reconsidered if shortage and/or medical necessity implications change, the US health regulator said.

""Drugs from these facilities are not allowed in the US until the company can demonstrate that the drugs manufactured from these plants and intended for the US market are in compliance with good manufacturing practice,"" the company said in its filing."

Indian drug-maker Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals announced recalling batches of its deworming medication Wormstop Suspension in South Africa, the second product being recalled by the company in two years.

The company announced the recall in the national daily Business Report.

""The reason for the recall is that the suspension does not flow easily from the bottles as it normally would when poured,"" it said.

""The suspension has thickened and is not flowing correctly. This may, during the administration, result in either under dosing which may lead to reindentation, or overdosing which may lead to reversible side effects such as vomiting, fever and diarrhoea,"" the company said, urging any person in possession of the product from two batch numbers listed to return it for refund or replacement.

No information was given on how Ranbaxy had discovered the fault in the product or how many bottles were in circulation.

In February 2016, the South African drug regulator Medicines Control Council requested a detailed report from Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals (SA) after it recalled 18,000 containers of folic acid tablets two months earlier.

Ranbaxy Laboratories' USD 30-million analgesics, cold, cough and flu preparations manufacturing facility near Johannesburg, where it initially partnered with South African Indian-origin company Be-Tabs Pharmaceuticals, was officially opened by then Indian Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma in September 2010.

Ranbaxy is a subsidiary of Sun Pharma, the largest pharmaceutical manufacturer in India."

Motilal Oswal's research report on Sun Pharma

Sun Pharma (SUNP) is trading at 16x FY19E PER, which is 20% and 30% below its 10- and 5-year average valuations, respectively. The stock has corrected more than 50% from its peak of >INR 1,100 (in April 2015). This downward movement can be attributed to the regulatory overhang on Halol, competition in key products, consolidation in the distribution channel, and visibility of limited launches of niche products.

Outlook

The stock at current valuations does not fully value its rich US pipeline and stable, cash-generating domestic business. Consistent outperformance domestically with market share gains and high profitability reflects management’s execution capability (and product selection skills). We assign a target P/E of 20x to SUNP’s base business EPS for FY19E and arrive at a target price of INR 650, implying 22% upside from current levels.

Mahesh Nandurkar of CLSA said Nifty trades at 18x 1-year forward or 20 percent premium to the last 10-year average and comes up as the key investor concern in most discussions.

Higher inflows are the reason for premium valuations, he feels.

Historical flow analysis implies if monthly net inflow remains at or above USD 400 million, the uptrend should continue, he said, adding this is also a base case assuming continued strong domestic flows, doubling of equity offering partially offset by higher buybacks over the next 12 months.

He feels the key risk is much higher equity raising than anticipated.

Higher valuations, however, make the market look farther ahead, bringing the potential capex cycle recovery in sight, Nandurkar said.

India's largest drug maker Sun Pharma shares dropped close to 13 percent on Monday with company’s management hinting at a tough year ahead with a “single digit decline” on consolidated sales due headwinds in US and uncertainty over resolution of its Halol plant, which is critical to company’s big product approvals.

“FY18 is likely to be challenging year for us,” said Dilip Shanghvi, Managing Director of Sun Pharma in the company’s post results earnings call. “US generics industry is facing rapidly changing market dynamics, increased competitive intensity and customer consolidation is leading to pressure on pricing,” Shanghvi said.

“Continued delay in approvals from Halol facility is also impacting us,” he added.

Sun Pharma’s Halol unit was issued a warning letter by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2015 due to violation of good manufacturing practices. Consequently, the pace of product approvals in the US has slackened.

What makes things complicated for Sun Pharma is the lack of any exclusivity benefit like the one it had in the form blood cancer drug imatinib in FY17 and also the uncertainty amongst the trade channels due to upcoming GST implementation in Indian market.

“We may even have a single digit decline in consolidated revenues,” Shangvi said.

While the sales may see a decline but research and development expenses are likely to be shot-up to 9-10 percent on total sales in FY18 compared to 7.6 percent in FY17.

The investments on R&D has become imperative as Sun Pharma invests on funding the clinical development of its global specialty pipeline.

The company also hinted of higher tax rate and a capex to the tune of USD 350 million in FY18.

The company’s March quarter earnings were way below street expectations.

Its net profit fell 13.6 percent to Rs 1,223.71 crore, while net sales were down 8 percent at Rs 6,825.16 crore on year-on-year basis.

Sales in the US were USD 381 million, down 34% from a high base last year.

Analysts tracking the company estimate FY18 to be much worse, though they expect things to look up from FY19. “We expect 15 percent decline in US sales in FY18 due to pricing pressure in Sun Pharma and Taro portfolio,” said Kumar Saurabh of brokerage house Motilal Oswal.

Saurabh expects pending launches such as Xelpros, Elepsia, Glumetza and Odomozo ramp-up to partially offset the revenue decline.

Brokerage house CLSA has downgraded Sun Pharma to sell and has cut the target price steeply from Rs 860 to Rs 500 on the back of 25 percent dip in US sales.

Global research firm JP Morgan observed that the company’s revenue decline guidance highlights increasing uncertainty in FY18.

Further, it believes that uncertainty on regulatory issues as well as earnings will keep the stock under pressure.

Having said that, JPMorgan expects the headwinds could give better entry point to focus on upside from specialty pharma and is well-positioned to transition into specialty pharma over the medium term."

Shares of Sun Pharma fell over 13 percent intraday on Monday after investors turned cautious of the stock following poor Q4 results.

India's largest drug maker's net profit fell 13.6 percent year-on-year in the quarter ended March 31 due to decline in US sales, its worst performance in several years. Sun Pharma reported a net profit of Rs 1,223.71 crore in the Q4 against Rs 1,416.13 crore a year ago, missing analysts’ estimates.

Sun Pharma’s sales in the US, which accounts for 37 percent of the total sales, dropped 34 percent to USD 381 million in Q4, largely due to loss of exclusivity of Imatinib and fall in sales at its subsidiary, the company said.

Fourth quarter earnings, some big generic approvals in US, NPPA's notices to drug makers for non-compliance with pricing rules and GST rate announcement were the highlights of the week.

How did pharma index perform?

The BSE Healthcare Index, which has shown signs of recovery last week, slipped into red this week. The BSE Healthcare Index underperformed compared to benchmark BSE Sensex. While the benchmark BSE Sensex gained 0.59 percent, BSE Healthcare declined 0.57 percent this week.

Shares of Lupin and Dr Reddy’s arrested their three-week fall by gaining 4.77 percent and 1.61 percent, respectively. Sun Pharma, Cadila, Aurobindo, Cipla, Divis, Glenmark were the losers. Glenmark was the worst performing stock losing almost 13.3 percent of its market value.

US FDA approvals

The United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) approvals of some key drugs kept the industry busy.

Dr Reddy’s and Lupin benefited out of two much anticipated approvals in US market. Dr Reddy’s got US FDA approval of generic anti-cancer drug Doxil. Doxil developed in partnership with Natco Pharma is a complex injectable drug with low competition.

Lupin got approval for its generic version of anti-schizophrenia drug Seroquel extended release tablets. Seroquel XR had US sales of USD 1.27 billion as March 2017. Lupin has limited competition and is expected to make good cash flows out of this generic.

Glenmark received US FDA nod to initiate a Phase 1 study of its anti-cancer biologic GBR 1342.

Laurus Labs cleared US FDA inspection for its plant in Vizag.

Drug price control and NPPA

Indian drug regulator the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) never ceased to be in news. This week NPPA showcause notices threatening penal action against dozens of pharmaceutical firms selling hundreds of fixed-dose combination (FDC) drugs without complying with various provisions of drug price control order. National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has identified 52 companies selling 201 FDC formulations without applying for price approval.

Startup fund

The government approved USD 250 million corpus as part of Biopharma Mission to fund biotech startups and accelerate innovation in the areas of vaccines, bio-therapeutics and medical devices. World Bank has agreed to line up USD 125 million for the fund.

Q4 results

Dishman, Laurus Labs and Glaxosmithkline have posted decent set of numbers in Q4 earnings.

Things to look out for next week

Busy week – with four big companies Lupin, Sun Pharma, Cadila and Aurobindo announcing their Q4 results. Will be interesting to see the how they performed in US market in backdrop of competition and pricing pressure. Drug makers will also give their commentary on GST rates and implementation. It was said that GST rollout could possible cause some disruption to the supply chain."

Drug maker Dr Reddy's on Wednesday said that it has received an approval from US FDA to launch anti-cancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection.

Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection used intravenously is the generic version of Janssen's Doxil .

Dr Reddy's partnered with Natco Pharma to develop the drug, considered to be an extremely complex product and getting US FDA approval remained a challenge.

Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy drug used against several types of cancers. The drug prevents the growth of cancer cells by interfering with the genetic material DNA, which is necessary for reproduction of cells.

The Doxil brand and generic had US sales of USD 196 million for the 12 months ending in March 2017, according to IMS Health.

""This approval represents the first of its kind for Dr Reddy's in the complex depot injectables arena,"" said Alok Sonig, Executive Vice President and Head of the North America generics business at Dr Reddy's.

""The approval further validates our capabilities to successfully develop and manufacture complex liposomal formulations. We are preparing for a commercial launch soon,"" Sonig added.

Analyts said generic Doxil approval provides relief to Dr Reddy's that's struggling with very low visibility of launches.

""If there is no incremental competition the drug is an USD 40-50 million opportunity,"" said Amey Chalke, Research Analyst tracking pharma at HDFC Securities.

Another analyst painted an even rosier picture saying it could mean USD 80 million in peak sales contribution from generic Doxil.

To be sure both Dr Reddy's and Natco will share profits. The ratio of the profit-sharing is not disclosed.

Blow to Sun Pharma

Sun Pharma is the only generic company that markets Doxil for which it got the approval in February 2013.

Generic Doxil has been the heavy-lifter for the company in the US for several years with annual sales clocking over USD 100 million.

Sun Pharma was also helped by the fact that the Janssen part of US-based Johnson & Johnson withdrew from the market due to capacity constraints.

Analysts say approval to Dr Reddy's is negative for Sun Pharma as the company in recent quarters is seen losing grip on the drug due to supply constraints given the regulatory issues at Halol plant and reentry of Janssen's Doxil.

Shares of Dr Reddy's and Natco gained 0.40 percent and 1.01 percent, respectively, and were trading at Rs 2734.05 and Rs 958, respectively on BSE at 1.40 pm. Shares of Sun Pharma dropped 0.68 percent to Rs 647.60, while the BSE Sensex gained 0.27 percent to 30,665.98 points."

Regulatory issues and fourth quarter earnings of some big Indian drug makers kept the week busy. The debate over generic drug names in prescriptions, stents, new drug additions to drug price control, data on Indian pharmaceutical market and US Senate clearing Scott Gottlieb name as US FDA chief also grabbed headlines.

How did pharma index perform?

The BSE Healthcare index after two consecutive weeks of slide recovered this week and even bettered the benchmark Sensex, gaining 1.11 percent, compared to a 0.91 percent rise of the main index.

Sun Pharma, Cadila, Aurobindo, Cipla and Piramal were the gainers. Lupin, Dr.Reddy’s, Glenmark and Divis were the losers. Glenmark is the worst performing stock losing almost 10 percent of its market value, while Piramal is the top gainer rising around 3.5 percent.

Domestic pharma in high single digit growth

Indian pharmaceutical market grew at 8.3 percent in April compared to 5.5 percent growth in the same period last year, according to data from market research firm AIOCD-AWACS. The growth comes on the back of steady normalization of supply chain disruption caused by demonetization and seasonal factors.

Regulatory developments

Scott Gottlieb was sworn in as US FDA commissioner this week. A doctor, FDA veteran, cancer survivor, biopharma investor and consultant, Gottlieb cleared the Senate test despite strong opposition from Democrats over his close business ties with the industry. Gottlieb will now set speed and safety limits for the agency and drug developers.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) observations kept the industry busy.

Lupin said it received 8 observations for its Aurangabad plant. The company said the observations are procedural in nature and the company is responding to it.

Biocon too had its share of observations for its Bengaluru facility, Torrent was also in news towards the end of the week for four observations for Indrad facility in Gujarat.

Marksans Pharma and Indoco Remedies have announced that they have successfully cleared UK drug regulator MHRA inspections for their plants in Goa bringing cheer to their investors. UK contributes about one-third of the generic formulation sales.

Stents, generics, drug price control and NPPA

A two weeks after Indian drug regulator the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) rejected applications of Abbott and Medtronics to withdraw their stent products in India on commercially unviable reasons, another major coronary stent maker was in news as its application seeking an upward revision of stent pricing cap was rejected by Indian government.

The medical device makers especially the multinational companies, who enjoy two-thirds of market for coronary stents used in angioplasties, are said to have been impacted by NPPA's decision to include stent maker under price control.

In further extension of its aggressive price control – NPPA included 19 medical devices to monitor their price movement and asked the manufacturers not increase the drug by more than 10 percent.

Q4 Results

Dr.Reddy’s Q4 results were lackluster, lack of significant new approvals, increasing competition and channel consolidation have started to impact, company’s critical North American generics business. However approval of API product from Miryalaguda facility which is under warning letter and revival of Russian generics business are some green shoots for the company.

Glenmark failed to live up to the expectations of investors in Q4 who were anticipating record breaking quarter on the back of 180-day marketing exclusivity for generic Zetia.

Last week, the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector was in the news over the use of generic drug names in prescriptions. Also, fourth quarter earnings, debate over drug price control and regulatory issues kept the spotlight on the sector.

Here is what happened in the sector:

How did pharma index perform?

The BSE Healthcare index underperfomed the benchmark Sensex, shedding 0.30 percent during the week, compared to a 1.74 percent rise in the main index.

Key pharma stocks like Lupin, Dr.Reddy’s, Aurobindo, Cadila, Glenmark and Cipla declined, and Sun Pharma remained flat.

Regulatory issues

The United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) released observations of some of the largest drug makers.

Sun Pharma - The company received 11 observations for its second most important plant at Dadra in terms of supplies to the US.

The company didn’t disclose nature of these observations, but analysts indicated that many were of procedural in nature.

Lupin - US FDA issued Form 483 with 3 observations to Lupin's Goa plant. The observations were largely procedural in nature related to standard operating procedures.

Dr Reddy's - The company received 11 procedural observations for its plant-3 at Bachupally in Hyderabad.

Generic debate

The debate on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement in Surat about the government contemplating on bringing a new law to ensure doctors prescribe generic drugs refuses to die down.

The Medical Council of India (MCI) - that registers doctors and regulates medical education - also issued a notification directing doctors to use generic names.

While the doctor bodies say that MCI code doesn’t restrict them to use brand names in prescription and said that ensuring patient gets the best quality drug is their priority.

The industry, unhappy with the development, called on the government to ensure uniform quality standards across the board before moving ahead with the proposed law.

Stents, drug price control and NPPA

The drug price regulator NPPA rejected applications of Abbott and Medtronics to withdraw their stent products in India on commercially unviable reasons.

The medical device makers especially the multinational companies, who enjoy two-thirds of market for coronary stents used in angioplasties, are said to have been impacted by NPPA's decision to include stent maker under price control.

NPPA last added further 15 new formulations under drug price control.

With the latest additions, the government has brought 732 essential drugs under price control in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) since April 2016.

Q4 Results

Biocon and its subsidiary Syngene announced Q4 results last week. The results were lacklustre. However, Biocon indicated that it’s proposed biosimilars foray into highly regulated markets such as US and Europe by FY19 is on track.

Thing to look out for this week

Ajanta Pharma, Merck, Sanofi, and Sun Pharma Advance Research Company will announce Q4 results this week.

Further news on US FDA inspections and the debate over use of generic name is also expected."

Last week, top Indian drug maker Sun Pharma said the US regulator would lift the import ban on its Mohali manufacturing facility. Investors greeted the news and the development was a big relief for Sun Pharma, which is still fighting to resolve regulatory issues across several of its plants, including the ones acquired from Ranbaxy.

There was similar good news for Cadila Healthcare, part of the Zydus Cadila group, which recently got the green light from the US Food and Drug Administration for its Moraiya plant in Gujarat.

Dr. Reddy’s had a mixed bag. While the company got three “addressable” minor observations for its Miryalaguda plant in Telangana, its two-year remediation work at Vishakhapatnam went in vain as it received 13 observations.

David Keeling is familiar with all these developments. As head of the global quality, compliance and remediation practice at management consulting firm McKinsey and Co, he has been working with these top drug makers and other members of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance to help them improve their overall quality.

Speaking to Moneycontrol about these efforts, he feels that while Indian companies have made progress over the past two years, there is still some way to go in terms of bringing in a culture of quality.

Excerpts of the interview:

What has changed in India pharma over the past two to three years that you’ve been working in the sector?

Three years ago, a number of regulatory actions started to occur. The industry hadn’t organized like this to address quality. I think what we have seen over the last 18 months is a concerted action both from individual companies and from the industry.

They addressed operating systems, procedures on the shop floor, they improved the management controls and governance to follow on the shop floor and they actually started to address quality culture.

Is it the first time that competing companies got together to address quality and compliance issues?

Even in the US and Europe, we haven’t seen such an orchestrated action by the industry. It’s remarkable and the IPA is unique as it was able to pull together all these competing companies who were not comfortable sharing information with each other.

Now, at the industry level they are sharing best practices. They are really trying to learn from each other and as a group they are trying to learn from the regulator. As an individual company, it’s more difficult to engage with the British regulator or the (US) FDA and get input on set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for data integrity.

Also, the commitment from CEO and the next level leadership has been total. Around 30-50 days of CEO time was allocated and the second layer of leadership involvement has been enormous.

How do you measure the outcome so far?

The IPA members are using a tool called POBOS – which is a benchmarking tool around quality. They are using that as a leading indicator of how they improving on a global scale. They are gathering those benchmarks [POBOS includes data of 600 plus plants globally with benchmarks along every step of the value chain].

The public metric will be the outcome of FDA audits. We are going to see over next 2-3 months the results from regulatory standpoint.

How much time do you think Indiam companies will take to catch up?

I think it could be three to 10-year journey. At the end of it, we will know we got it right when no one has to watch an operator on the line or a person in the lab to make sure that they do the right thing. That’s the culture shift for the industry that we have to get. Any culture change will take a lot of time. Even in the US it will take the same time. We have a long way to go."

Brokerage houses have maintained a buy call on Sun Pharmaceutical Industries after the US Food & Drug Administration said it would lift the import alert imposed on Mohali (Punjab) manufacturing facility.

It will also remove the facility from official action initiated (OAI) status.

""This proposed action will clear the path for Sun Pharma to supply approved products from the Mohali facility to the US market, subject to normal US FDA regulatory requirements, the pharma major said in its filing.

Mohali, which had been under import alert since September 2013, is an oral solids plant and capacity-wise is understood to be as big as Ranbaxy's Ohm Labs facility in the US.

CLSA says Mohali plant clearance is a significant positive development for the company and shows progress on regulatory issues. Clearance makes a large oral solid dosage site available to de-risk existing sites.

Sun can do certain site transfers to the Mohali plant and can start filing products with potential launch in FY19-20, it adds.

CLSA says resolution of Halol facility, which is currently undergoing remediation, would be the next major regulatory trigger. ""We currently build in resolution of the Halol plant by Q3FY18. Early resolution of the Halol plant has earnings upgrade potential for company.""

The other facilities that have consent decree from the US FDA are Toansa, Dewas and Paonta Sahib facilities, all of which were part of Ranbaxy, says CLSA, which has a buy call on Sun Pharma, with a target price at Rs 790.

Macquarie says with the lifting of the import alert from Mohali, it expects approvals (around 30 ANDAs were pending approval in 2013 before import alert) to start coming through from this facility.

The brokerage house has retained Sun Pharma as its preferred pick among the large-cap names as it continues to believe Sun is best positioned for specialty transition. It has maintained outperform rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 850.

While maintaining buy rating on the stock with a target price at Rs 750, Bank of America Merrill Lynch also says Mohali import alert resolution is in line with its earlier expectations and is expected to be sentimentally positive for valuations.

""It demonstrates management ability to resolve critical regulatory concerns; Mohali is likely to be used as a transfer site for critical oral filings from Halol as well as new filings; the synergy benefits from the Ranbaxy merger are likely to be higher; and there could be cost optimisation as some products are believed to have been transferred out of Mohali to Ohm Labs facility in US due to the import alert,"" the brokerage house explains why Mohali clearance is sentimentally positive for Sun's valuations.

Deutsche Bank has reiterated its buy rating on Sun Pharma with a target price of Rs 872, saying delay in resolving warning letter at Halol plant; slower-than-expected growth in the Indian formulations market; and faster-than-expected decline in Taro's sales are downside risks for the stock.

Morgan Stanley says the lifting of the ban serves two purposes - one is that it generates goodwill with Sun's customers and regulators and second is it adds a new sizable site to Sun's supply chain over mid to long term.

The brokerage house does not expect material EPS impact from Mohali over next few quarters.

Morgan continued to remain equal-weight on Sun in view of near-term growth challenges due to Taro and gGleevec concentration. The specialty portfolio may take a while to ramp up in the US, it says, adding valuations appear full now.

The Mohali facility was inherited by Sun Pharma as part of its acquisition of Ranbaxy Laboratories in 2015. The US FDA had taken action against the Mohali facility in 2013 when it ordered the facility to be fully subject to Ranbaxy's Consent Decree of Permanent Injunction. Certain conditions of the consent decree will continue to be applicable to the Mohali facility.

At 12:03 hours IST, the stock was quoting at Rs 711.10, up Rs 2.85, or 0.40 percent on the BSE.

The Halol unit of India’s largest drugmaker Sun Pharma, which has not received new product approvals from US regulators ever since getting warning letters from them in 2015, is unlikely to see a resolution of the problem this calendar year, contrary to many analysts’ expectations.

Production at Halol, one of Sun’s largest manufacturing facilities, accounted for 40 percent of US sales, and the action by the US Food and Drug Administration has hit the company’s stock price over the last two years.

A Sun spokesman said in an emailed response to a Moneycontrol News questionnaire: “We are fully committed to bringing Halol back into compliance. For this, we have submitted our response and corrective action plan to the US FDA. We are now in the process of implementing the corrective steps. We are working towards addressing this over the next few quarters; however, we have not given any specific timeline as it is difficult to do so.”

The Halol unit, which manufactures injectibles and oral solids, was issued the letters following a surprise inspection carried out by the US FDA in September 2014. The company roped in consultants to address the concerns and after a lengthy remediation process invited the regulator for another round of inspections in November 2016. The second inspection also resulted in nine observations under Form 483.

Experts say that since the second inspection also resulted in some observations, the company will not invite a third inspection in a hurry. While none of the nine observations are repeat observations, a resolution would definitely take longer than six months. Globally, resolutions typically take at least 500 days and the data for India and China is worse. So far, only one warning letter has seen a resolution out of 64 issued to Indian and Chinese companies in the last 52 months. As the table below shows, resolution at Wockhardt is still pending, over 1,300 days since warning letters were issued.

Several analysts are factoring in a revival in Sun’s base business in FY18 as Halol would see resolution. For instance, IIFL Research says, “We believe Sun can resolve Halol issues in six months, which will lead to resumption of product approvals and will enable it to grow US revenues from a shrunken base.”

Sales of Sun Pharma’s FY16 US sales fell to USD 2.06 billion from USD 2.24 billion in FY15, as production at Halol dropped due to remedial action undertaken by the company at the production unit.

Bharti Airtel

CLSA has downgraded Bharti Airtel to underperform from buy and also revised target downward to Rs 380 from Rs 393 (implying 4 percent upside) after lowering FY18-19 revenue by over 10 percent & EBITDA by 17-19 percent.

CLSA says there is a high risk of ARPU dilution but consolidation in industry is a positive.

Reduction in dual SIMs and sector consolidation may give upside to estimates, it feels. CLSA says company leads with 33 percent revenue market share. ""We see further gains led by spectrum and execution edge,"" the brokerage house says.

Sun Pharma

CLSA says Mohali plant clearance is a significant for the company and indicates progress on regulatory issues.

It says now resolution of Halol facility would be the next major regulatory trigger.

""We currently build in resolution of the Halol plant by Q3FY18. Early resolution of the Halol plant has earnings upgrade potential for company,"" the brokerage house says.

Other units having consent decree from US FDA are Toansa, Dewas, Paonta Sahib.

CLSA has a buy call on the stock, with a target price at Rs 790.

Morgan Stanley also says Mohali clearance is a relief for the company but retained equal-weight rating on bigger challenges.

The brokerage house does not expect material EPS impact from Mohali over next few quarters, it feels. The company has near-term growth challenges due to Taro & gGleevec concentration, Morgan says.

According to the research firm, specialty portfolio may take a while to ramp up in the US and valuations appear full for the time being.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch also says Mohali resolution is sentimentally positive and this resolution is in-line with earlier expectations.

Better synergy benefits now are likely on account of Ranbaxy merger and it may be used for site transfers for important products, it adds.

The brokerage house has maintained buy rating on Sun Pharma with a target price at Rs 750.

While reiterating buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 872, Deutsche Bank says after clearance to Mohali unit, all eyes are on Halol plant resolution.

Delay in resolving warning letter at Halol Plant is a key risk, it feels.

Macquarie expects approvals to start coming through from Mohali. The stock is preferred pick among the large cap names and the company is best positioned for specialty transition, it says.

The research firm has maintained outperform rating on Sun Pharma with a target price of Rs 850.

IndusInd Bank

Jefferies says the bank is acquiring ILFS Securities Services with a view of capturing equity cap market supply-chain. Benefits for the company includes fee income & possibly better deployment of free-float.

Deal could be marginally positive for the stock and seems to have happened at a fair premium to the book value, it feels.

Morgan Stanley says capital impact on bank from ILFS Securities Services' acquisition will depend on the transaction's structure.

If ISSL remains arm, then bank's parent Tier I will be affected to extent of price paid, it feels.

Morgan says according to management, ISSL acquisition is broadly in-line with the bank's strategy. It will possible for ILFS to offer IndusInd’s banking products to its clients, the brokerage house feels.

Biocon

Bank of America Merrill Lynch has a buy call on Biocon, with increased target price at Rs 1,170 on rising visibility over Tratsuzumab launch.

The company may launch first biosimilar for Herceptin post settlement with Roche. First nod for Tratsuzumab will aid price erosion and better settlement with innovators, it says.

BoAML says settlement by innovators indicates superior quality of biosimilar filings. Triggers for re-rating of the stock include Glargine, Humira and GCSF filings in next few quarters.

Morgan Stanley is overweight on Biocon with a target price at Rs 1,264 as Mylan settlement with Genentech & Roche is a positive with respect to Trastuzumab and eliminates legal hurdles & provides certainty of launch.

The brokerage house expects US launch for Trastuzumab to be around mid-2019 and expects EU launch to be around mid-2018 for Trastuzumab.

Citi also says Roche settlement is positive for Trastuzumab launch. Hence, the brokerage house raised target price on the stock to Rs 1,315 from Rs 1,180. It has a buy call on the stock.

Citi raised net present value for Trastuzumab in its target to Rs 195 and raised value for Trastuzumab’s base to Rs 800 per share as it rolled over to 20x June 2018.

NMDC

Macquarie has resumed its coverage on NMDC with an underperform rating and set a target price at Rs 110 as it feels the company should see 23 percent YoY sales volume in FY17.

Coal India

Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on Coal India and slashed target price to Rs 373 from Rs 395. Normalisation of thermal power generation growth is a key catalyst, it says.

Credit Suisse estimates free cash flow per share in FY18-19 to be in the range of Rs 17-19.

Reliance Industries

Morgan Stanley is overweight on Reliance Industries with a target price at Rs 1,506.

""While investor debate on telecom earnings and energy project execution may continue near term, we believe delivery of energy earnings will provide the next leg of stock performance, as it should boost earnings expectations and lift returns. Telecom's drag on returns may reduce at the margin but is unlikely to halt overall growth in returns, as energy investments deliver on earnings growth steadily until FY20,"" it says.

Cement

CLSA feels demonetisation continues to haunt cement industry as demand is under pressure in many markets and liquidity is still an issue that is hampering cement consumption.

Dealers are hopeful of pick-up ahead as government-led infra projects kick off.

Pricing is showing mixed trends. North India is back at pre-demonetisation levels while west Indian markets are also seeing stabilisation, wherein prices are up 7-13 percent. East India continues to suffer from demand-supply imbalance.

CLSA remains negative on the sector as it believes 2017 will be a lacklustre year for the sector. It has negative ratings on all cement company except UltraTech Cement that is its only preferred name in the sector."

Equity benchmarks closed off day's high amid volatility on Friday, supported by private banking & financials and pharma stocks. The BSE Sensex shot up 425 points in opening led by HDFC Bank after RBI lifted the ban on FIIs investment; but erased more than half of gains due to some profit booking in banks and technology shares as the day progressed.

The Sensex ended at 28468.75 - the highest closing level in five months - , up 167.48 points from the previous close. The 50-share NSE Nifty rose 43.70 points to end at 8821.70 after hitting a day's high of 8896.45.

It's a clear sign that Nifty is facing pressure at higher levels, Jayant Manglik of Religare Securities says.

Stocks are also seeing volatile swings these days and expect this to continue due to the derivatives expiry ahead, he feels. He suggests limiting leveraged positions in this situation.

Ajay Srivastava of Dimensions Corporate Finance Services cautions, the market valuations are not cheap and investors need to be picky and ready to take 'serious risks' to see healthy returns.

The broader markets slightly underperformed benchmarks, with the BSE Midcap index rising half a percent, though the market breadth was balanced. Of the 3022 stocks traded today, 1426 were gainers and 1390 were losers on the BSE.

Benchmark indices retained upside for the fourth consecutive week as the Sensex gained 0.5 percent and Nifty rose 0.3 percent, led by banks.



Shares of HDFC Bank, the country's second largest private sector lender that has more than 8 percent weightage in Nifty 50, ended at record high of Rs 1,377.15. It rallied 10 percent to hit an intraday all-time high of Rs 1,450 on major buying after RBI lifted the ban on FIIs investment but lost 5 percent from day's high to finish with 3.75 percent gains as the Reserve Bank put it back in FIIs ban list after foreign shareholding crossed overall limit of 74 percent during the day. HDFC rose 0.6 percent.

The stock helped Nifty Bank to hit record high intraday. It ended 4 points below its record closing level hit on January 27, 2015, up 1.5 percent. ICICI Bank rose 1.5 percent while SBI and Axis Bank lost over half a percent.

Pharma stocks remained in limelight for second consecutive session. Sun Pharma surged 4 percent again. Cadila Healthcare rallied 5 percent on top of 20 percent gains in previous session as Morgan Stanley stayed overweight on the stock, with increased target price at Rs 539 from Rs 439 after the company did not get any observations from USFDA for Moraiya facility.

GAIL, IndusInd Bank and Tata Power ended at fresh 52-week closing high, up more than 1 percent. Reliance Industries, Tata Motors and Lupin gained 1-1.5 percent.

After inclusion in the Nifty with effect from March 31, Indiabulls Housing and IOC gained more than 2 percent while BHEL and Idea Cellular were under pressure as both will be excluded from the index.

""We would like to state that there are no claims against the company for monetary damages because the proposed palonosetron product has not been marketed,"" Dr Reddy's Laboratories said in a BSE filing.

""As for 'quantum of claims', the claims only sought injunctive relief against the company to prohibit the manufacturing, use, import and sale of the company's palonosetron product prior to expiration of the patents-in-suit.

""Therefore, the company believes there is no monetary 'compensation' or 'penalty' damages owed to Helsinn due to this decision,"" it added.

Dr Reddy's Laboratories yesterday said it has received an unfavourable ruling in a US court regarding a patent infringement case over Aloxi.

""The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey issued its opinion regarding Helsinn Healthcare's patent infringement claims against Dr Reddy's proposed palonosetron product,"" the company said.

""The court found that Dr Reddy's proposed palonosetron hydrochloride 0.25 mg/5 ml infringes on certain claims of US patents...and that the asserted claims were not valid,"" it added.

Helsinn Healthcare SA is a Switzerland-based pharma company.

""We are disappointed in the decision and intend to pursue an appeal in due course,"" a company spokesperson said.

Equity benchmarks rebounded after two-day losses, with the Sensex rising more than 150 points intraday Thursday, driven by pharma sector after positive vibes from USFDA and technology stocks on buyback buzz.

The 30-share BSE Sensex gained 145.71 points at 28301.27 and the 50-share NSE Nifty rose 53.30 points to 8778 despite weakness in Europe.

The broader markets outperformed benchmarks, with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices climbed 1.3 percent each on strong breadth. About two shares gained for every share falling on bourses.

The Nifty may consolidate between 8,720 and 8,825 points for a few days, says Mitessh Thakkar of mitesshthakkar.com. Ashwani Gujral of ashwanigujral.com also says the Nifty will continue to remain choppy till it crosses the 8,820 mark as there seems to be no big money in the market.

Being at the fag end of the earning season, Indian markets would now take cues from RBI-FOMC minutes next week, Anand James of Geojit Financial Services says.



Infosys was the leading contributor to Sensex's rally, up 3 percent on hopes of share buyback from the company, especially after TCS announced that the board will consider share buyback on February 20. TCS gained 1.3 percent. The Nifty IT index rose 2 percent.

Healthcare stocks were biggest gainers, especially due to positive vibes from USFDA. The Nifty Pharma index jumped over 2.5 percent, led by Cadila Healthcare. The stock was locked at 20 percent upper circuit after the company said it did not receive any observations from USFDA for its formulation facility at Moraiya indicating successful resolution of the warning letter on the plant.

The rally also spilled over to other pharma stocks like Sun Pharma (up 4.3 percent), Aurobindo Pharma (up 3 percent) and Divis Labs (up 3.5 percent), which have exposure to US. Dr Reddy's Labs also rebounded 0.6 percent in late trade (after hitting a 52-week low intraday) as it got an unfavourable ruling in a US court regarding a patent infringement case over anti-nausea injection Aloxi.

State Bank of India gained 0.65 percent and its subsidiaries State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore and State Bank of Travancore rallied 3.5-4.7 percent after Cabinet's approval for merger plan.

Benchmark indices entered into consolidation phase after opening rally as investors closely watch GST Council meet on February 18 and assembly elections in five states that will end on March 8.

The 30-share BSE Sensex gained 30.88 points at 28186.44 and the 50-share NSE Nifty rose 7.05 points to 8731.75.

Market has digested most of the news post demonetisation emerging relatively unscathed and S Krishna Kumar of Sundaram Mutual Fund feels every dip can now be invested in.

On the outperformance in midcaps and smallcap space, he says, it is better to tread with caution and pick specific quality stocks than watching the broad market index.

SBI was up 1.4 percent after the merger of five associate banks received Cabinet approval. State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore and State Bank of Travancore rallied 4-5 percent.

TCS gained 1.7 percent as it says the board of directors will consider buyback of shares on February 20.

Benchmark indices as well as broader markets were moderately under pressure amid consolidation, with the Nifty consistently struggling below 8800 level as investors shifted their focus to states elections from earnings. Assembly elections in five states will end on March 8 and results will be announced on March 11.

The 30-share BSE Sensex was down 47.66 points at 28291.65 and the 50-share NSE Nifty fell 7.70 points to 8784.60. About 1207 shares declined against 848 advancing shares on the BSE.

Market valuations are slightly beyond comfort and with no big macro events lined up, a runaway rally is unlikely, says Mahesh Patil of Birla Sun Life AMC.

He feels it is better to wait-and-watch on investments as earnings recovery is likely to be slow and the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) is round the corner.

Tata Motors retained its top position in selling list, down nearly 8 percent as CLSA downgraded the stock to sell from buy and slashed target price to Rs 405 from Rs 650 after cutting FY18-19 EPS estimates by 25-31 percent after dismal performance in Q3FY17.

Sun Pharma was also down more than 3 percent after earnings missed analysts' expectations. Nomura cut FY17 earnings estimates for the company by 9 percent, FY18 by 5 percent & FY19 by 3 percent. It sees 11 percent revenue growth & 10 percent earnings growth over next 2 years.

Adani Ports gained 1.6 percent. While assigning a buy call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 375, CLSA says strategic asset should deliver 54 percent growth in port EBITDA over FY16-19 and new corporate structure could lower taxes & boost EPS growth."

The NSE Nifty snapped four-day winning streak on Tuesday, closing below the 8800-mark amid consolidation, dragged by Tata Motors post disappointing earnings. However, buying in oil and telecom stocks arrested losses. Investors remained cautious ahead of Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen's two-day congressional testimony starting later today, which may give a hint for further rate hike.

The 30-share BSE Sensex was down 12.31 points at 28339.31 and the 50-share NSE Nifty fell 12.75 points to 8792.30.

""We usually see a strong reaction on the either side after such consolidation phase so traders should prepare themselves for one-sided movement,"" says Jayant Manglik of Religare Securities.

One way is to keep positions hedged or to book profits and wait on side lines for further cues, he suggests.

Andrew Holland of Avendus Capital feels risks are on the downside rather than upside for the markets, but that are being supported by favourable global momentum since demonetisation.

""We are starting to see a gradual pick up in trade, but it is not V-shaped. If and when goods and services tax (GST) is rolled out which is July 1, then I would think that also has a risk to the downside for the economy. Maybe that is a little bit of a shock which the economy will have to take in terms of implementation,"" Holland says.



The broader markets underperformed benchmarks, with the BSE Midcap falling 0.6 percent on weak breadth. About 1785 shares declined against 1048 advancing shares on the exchange.

On the macro front, WPI inflation (i.e. based on wholesale prices) jumped to a 30-month high of 5.25 percent in January from 3.39 percent in previous month due to increase in crude oil prices. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation declined to 3.17 percent in January compared to 3.41 percent in December 2016 due to low demand post demonetisation.

Tata Motors shares fell 3.7 percent after reporting dismal performance in December quarter. Profit tanked 96 percent year-on-year due to big loss in domestic business and operational weakness in JLR.

The Nifty Auto index also lost 1.5 percent. Maruti Suzuki, Hero Motocorp and Bajaj Auto were down 1-2 percent.

Sun Pharma also declined 0.7 percent after lower-than-expected earnings. Profit fell 4.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,472 crore, impacted by higher tax cost and slow growth in US business.

Vedanta was down 1 percent as earnings missed analysts' expectations. Profit jumped 4.5-fold to Rs 1866 crore on strong operational performance YoY but that was lower than estimates of Rs 2,150 crore.

Telecom stocks gained momentum that may be on hopes of Vodafone-Idea merger. Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular rose 2-3 percent.

Oil & gas stocks like Reliance Industries, ONGC and GAIL gained 2-3 percent on value buying.

Sun TV Network gained 2.8 percent and Raj Television rallied nearly 6 percent after AIADMK General Secretary VK Sasikala's hopes to become a chief minister of Tamil Nadu dashed by Supreme Court verdict. The court has convicted her in the 20-year-old disproportionate asset case and sentenced her to 4 years of imprisonment.

Chief among the suggestions are that the government should not cut direct tax rates—income tax and corporate tax—and that it should instead cut indirect taxes like service tax and excise duties to boost demand in the economy. It is widely expected that the Budget will announce relax the income-tax threshold limits to regain the goodwill of the middle class, which has been inconvenienced by demonetisation.11:40 am Earnings poll: Software firm Tech Mahindra's third quarter profit is expected to increase sharply by 21.2 percent sequentially to Rs 780 crore on strong operational performance.

Any taxation on equity markets, though unlikely, will definitely irk the markets, the CNBC-TV18's Consulting Editor told the channel, adding that the markets haven’t factored in imposition of long-term capital gains tax. While the effect of a direct tax cut depends on the amount of relief the government provides, it may not be, however, a game-changer, Mukherjee said. Commenting on recently market rally, he said that Nifty hitting 8600-8700 levels surprised many of the Dalal Street. The rally was partly driven by a combination of factors such as good earnings report card of companies, global upmove and Budget expectations, he said. On February 1, consumer-related plays will come out depending on tax cuts announced by the Finance Ministry, Mukherjee said, expressing reservations that such rally may not be sustainable.

Most surveys indicate a sharp pullback for US economy, says Sharma, adding that with economic momentum returning to developed economies it could be negative for emerging markets. Moreover, with US talking about reducing corporate tax rate to as much as 15-20 percent could be a big negative for emerging markets because investors then would naturally flock to US market. So if emerging market like India wants to attract capital then reducing corporate tax rate is very crucial. ""India needs to match the corporate tax rate with the US,"" he adds.

9:45 am Expert take on Italy Referendum: Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned after suffering a heavy defeat in a referendum over his plan to reform the constitution. The defeat has raised questions about market stability, but analysts at UBS and JP Morgan feel that the markets will take the jitters in their stride. Italian referendum is unlikely to have as big an impact as that from Brexit or Donald Trump’s victory in the recently-concluded US Presidential elections, Geoffrey Dennis of UBS Investment Bank told CNBC-TV18. Strong US jobs data only adds to the view that the US Federal Reserve will raise rates now, he said, adding that global markets have already priced in a rate hike by the US Fed mid-December. He further said that UBS expects two rate hikes by the US Fed next year. James Glassman of JPMorgan told CNBC-TV18 that Italian vote count and Renzi’s resignation was on expected lines and hence market reaction to the outcome of the referendum will be limited.9:30 am FII view: Christopher Wood of CLSA says the issue for financial markets is whether a further bond riot would start to prove negative for equities.

He says Greed & fear's guess is that, at some point between 2.5 percent and 3 percent percent on the 10-year Treasury, equity investors would start to view the scale of the bond sell-off as negative.

That in turn could pose trouble for widely followed 'risk parity' strategies which would not do well in an environment where bonds and stocks went down together, a double whammy that has not happened in America on a quarterly basis since Q109, he feels.

When asked whether RBI may levy processing fee on the entities which have pulled out, Mundra said the current regulation does not give scope of charging a processing fee.

Edelweiss's research report on Sun PharmaSun Pharmaceuticals’ (SUNP) acquisition of Insite Vision has started bearing fruits with the company receiving the final approval for Bromsite, likely to be its first specialty ophthal launch in the US. Given that the label includes prophylactic utilisation, unlike competition, the product is likely to corner significant share of the USD400mn market. We reiterate our thesis that FY17 will be the year of transformation for the company in which earnings will accelerate and the move towards specialty will become more apparent (Refer Time to Evolve, dated November 2015). We expect SUNP to once again command premium valuations as specialty initiatives start bearing fruits. Maintain ’BUY’ with TP of INR920. We maintain ‘BUY/Sector Outperformer’ with TP of INR920 (22x FY18E EPS). Owing to its investments in specialty initiatives, we find the company to be best placed to navigate the slowdown in the US generic business. SUNP is our top pick in the sector.

Hindustan Unilever’s Lakmé and TRESemmé, Marico, Hindware, ICICI Prudential, Sun Pharma, Philips and Cargill were some of the brands that were felicitated for their innovative products.



It was a fun-filled night full of music, psychedelic lights, laughs, friendly rivalries and even stronger revelries at the ninth Product of the Year Awards, 2016 India edition, on 19 March, at Blue Frog, Mumbai. The event, showcased some of the best products in the country that were filtered through a pan India consumer survey conducted by their Research Affiliate Nielsen India. The OOH partner was Future Media. Zee Business was the media presenter and DNA was the print partner.



The host, Cyrus Broacha disarmed the audience with his trademark humour, including the fact that the show was on the night of the India Pakistan World T20 game, and joked that if Pakistan won then everyone would be forgiven for attending the award show.



Following this, a video on winning products was showcased with bytes from leading names in the FMCG sector, as well as bytes from some jury members who lauded the unbiased nature of the awards.



Raj Arora, CEO - Product of the Year India, while speaking of the awards that are now almost three decades old, said that the idea behind the awards was to get consumers directed to the best products in the market and also to reward manufacturers for their quality and innovation. He mentioned that a large number of winners continue to report a meaningful upward tick in their sales and market share.



The guest of honour, Rana Barua, CEO - Contract Advertising , said, “It is an interesting concept because we as advertisers, deal with clients and try and understand the product. Innovation is an important word. It is a must for every brand. When classical organizations decide to change and play the game of innovation, that is when we know a company is successful. The key is to stay relevant,” he said.



Vijay Udasi, Sr. Vice President - Nielsen India, addressed how and why e-commerce India has evolved. “E-commerce industry is pegged at USD 16 billion, with 61 per cent focusing on travel. The reason for this is internet penetration has changed and e-commerce owners are getting more aggressive when it comes to marketing their deals and products available,” he said.



Udasi added, “Over 170 million Indians are smartphone owners with Internet connection,” he said, adding that there are those who prefer purchasing certain goods offline.



Mike Nolan, Global CEO - Product of the Year, then said, “Innovation matters, but it is not easy. Companies have to be lauded for the work they do. What Product of the Year does is helps people make THAT choice for the best products in the world. Product of the Year gives the brands the extra edge in a competitive market. And that is the ball game. Once you win, what do you do next? One is win the award and forget about it. And the other is talk about it at work and get competitive advantage. Your competitors will fear this,” he said.



About the Company



Product of the Year (POY) – is an international standard of consumer recognition that was founded 29 years ago in France and is currently in 42 countries. It helps guide the consumer to the best products and rewards manufacturers for their quality and innovation.



The process of associating with Product of the Year is simple. FMCG companies nominate their products that get filtered by a Jury of eminent citizens.

ICICIDirect's research report on Sun PharmaRevenues grew 2.2 YoY to | 7082.1 crore (I-direct estimate: | 6734.5) on account of 8.3% growth in domestic sales to | 1890.3 crore and 69.7% growth in API sales to | 441 crore led by consolidation of opiates business in Australia. US formulations, on the other hand, continued to languish and declined ~6% to | 3200.3 crore Sequentially, EBITDA margins increased 235 bps to 30.6% (I-direct estimate: 28.5%) due to strong margins at Taro. Taro’s EBITDA margins increased 756 bps QoQ to 68.8%. EBITDA grew 12.2% QoQ to | 2169 crore (I-direct estimate: | 1919.3 crore) Net profit grew 258.3% YoY | 1416.6 crore (I-direct estimate: | 1107.1 crore) mainly due to higher other income led by proceeds received on brand divestments and lower taxation Adjusting for consolidation and one-offs, the ex-taro Q3 numbers were more or less in line with our expectations. We believe most of the negatives pertaining to the Halol plant have been factored in. However, until the Halol resolution, US sales are likely to remain under pressure even though the company has sufficient bandwidth to make alternate arrangements. Other developments in the field of biosimilars and acquisitions are likely to be overshadowed by this glaring issue. The progress on Halol may have prompted the management to approach the USFDA in Q1FY17 for re-inspection. We have ascribed a target price of | 845 based on 24x FY18E EPS of | 35.2. We maintain our HOLD rating until any positive development takes place regarding Halol.

According to the International Sugar Organisation (ISO), there is likely to be global sugar shortfall of 5 million tonnes in FY16, much higher than November estimates of 3.5 million tonnes. Verma says the production this year is estimated to drop to around 260 lakh tonne, compared to 283 lakh tonne last year, due to weak monsoon. The government has given an export quota of 32 lakh tonnes, of which companies have contracted about 12 lakh tonnes for exports, he says.

Though, it has its own set of problems — frustrating tax situation, rumours about changes being made to the definition (tenure) of long-term capital gains and also some confusion on what markets and economists alike want from the Budget, says Mowat. He says the current vulnerability in the Indian markets is on the back of bullish positioning seen earlier. As far as China is concerned, Mowat feels the situation is becoming less precarious and the pressure on the Chinese currency (yuan) is easing now. He does not see China dragging India lower, instead feels it is the repositioning of portfolios that has dragged the country lower.Don't miss: Ready to ease if market rout hurts economy: BOJ's Kuroda

(Sun Pharma) total income remained flat y-o-y but grew marginally at 3.6% q-o-q to Rs 70,821 mn in 3Q FY16, in-line with our expectations for the quarter. EBITDA remained flat y-o-y but increased 12.2% q-o-q to Rs 21,690 mn. EBITDA margin decreased 61 bps y-o-y but increased 235 bps q-o-q to 30.6% during 3Q FY16, exceeding our expectations for the quarter, mainly due to lower than expected Cost of Goods Sold and Employee benefits expense as a percentage of revenues. Net profit increased 259.9% y-o-y and 28.6% q-o-q to Rs 14,229 mn. Net margin increased 1439 bps y-o-y and 391 bps q-o-q to 20.1% in 3Q FY16, exceeding our expectation mainly due to better than expected performance at operating level further enhanced by lower than expected tax expense.Though Sun Pharma continues to face integration issue with Ranbaxy, negatively impacting the company’s profitability, profitability of the company is improving with the help of Taro’s performance and improvement in US business. Research & Development (R&D) expense is expected to remain high due to expense related to development of MK-3222 (Tildrakizumab), an investigational therapeutic antibody candidate, which is currently being evaluated in Phase 3 registration trials for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, a skin ailment. We continue to believe that profitability will be negatively impacted by cost associated not only with integration of Ranbaxy but also remediation efforts at Halol, Mohali, Devas, Poanta Sahib and Toansa facilities. However, Sun Pharma Management has indicated that it expects to approach US FDA for re-inspection of Halol plant during 1Q FY17. Also, the company has successfully launched generic Gleevac on 1 Feb 2016 and expects to garner 30% market share gradually. Management has continued to supply Doxil to other markets from Halol facility without interruption and expects to continue doing so but sales have been impacted by competition.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

KRChoksey's research report on Sun PharmaSun Pharma’s result was above our estimates. Total revenues stood at INR 70.5bn registering a growth of 2.4% YoY on account of slowdown in the US business due to temporary supply constraints at its Halol plant & competitive pressure on some of the products. Taro posted sales of USD 258mn, showed growth of 9% YoY and 22% QoQ with marginal increase in volumes. Elevated other income at INR 2.2bn and lower interest cost coupled with superior operating efficiency and cost curtailment led to enhanced EBITDA at INR 21.7bn which was flattish YoY and up 12% QoQ with EBITDA margins at 30.6% down 61bps YoY and up 235 QoQ. R&D expenses during the quarter stood at INR 5.8bn, at 8.2% of sales growing by 23% YoY and 21% QoQ on account of expenses related to clinical development of Tildrakizumab. PAT stood at INR 14.2bn up 258% YoY and up 28% QoQ on account of higher tax outgo of INR 10.3bn in the corresponding quarter of the last year as compared to a tax outgo of INR 2bn (tax rate of 10% as a % of PBT). EPS for the quarter stood at INR 5.9We have increased the multiple on account of enhanced gGleevec opportunity, expectation of robust revenue from Taro’s orphan drug Keveyis (we have modeled USD 90mn as FY18E sales of the drug) coupled with Sun’s ability to turn around stressed assets and synergy benefits from erstwhile Ranbaxy in tune of USD 300mn enhancing the companies margins to 34% in FY18E.

As far as the quantum of rate cuts in this entire calendar year is concerned, 60 percent of respondents believe that there will only be one 25 bps rate cut in the entire calendar and the remaining 40 percent are divided between a 50 bps and 75 bps rate cut from the governor.

Edelweiss's reserach report on Sun Pharma As we anticipated (refer Warning letter to Halol: A known risk plays out; dated December 21, 2015), the FDA Warning Letter (WL) issued to Sun Pharmaceuticals’ (SUNP) Halol unit materially allays investor concerns about further escalation or long delays in remediation. The WL is on the same lines as described by management and it appears that FDA has only reviewed SUNP’s very first response (Oct ‘14) in detail. FDA has highlighted only 6 concerns (versus 23 in Form 483) related to sterility assurance, system controls and minor environmental issues. While FDA has asked for progress reports on some of the issues, it has stated that it would evaluate some of the remediation actions in its follow-up inspection. SUNP remains our top conviction call with a long-term time frame.We believe SUNP is conducting an intensive remediation exercise and this WL does not represent FDA’s final assessment of the remediation efforts, rather an administrative dialogue on the unit’s original issues highlighted in September 2014. We maintain ‘BUY/Sector Outperformer’ with TP of INR920 (22x FY18E EPS).

Market expert Jyotivardhan Jaipuria says, ""Essentially, the big consensus is that growth is the missing element everywhere. So, growth is missing in India, but growth is probably a bigger worry outside India. And till that comes back, what we are playing is hope versus reality -- that we hope that things are getting better but somewhere every time, when earnings come out, the reality is that this is not really panning out.""

Meanwhile, the winter session has drawn to a close with both houses passing just nine bills. The opposition parties headed by congress repeatedly kept disrupting the proceedings, over one issue or the other.

Late sell-off has wiped out all the gains on Dalal Street. Select heavies dragged the market while cash volumes remained low ahead of a holiday season.

The Sensex was down 145.25 points or 0.6 percent at 25590.65 and the Nifty slipped 48.35 points or 0.6 percent at 7786.10. About 1307 shares have advanced, 1372 shares declined, and 236 shares are unchanged.

Meanwhile, Neelkanth Mishra, Head of Equity Strategy India, Credit Suisse expects foreign institutional investors to be net sellers in 2016 as well. The domestic economy is beginning to do well, but there are lots of worrying signs in global markets which could affect India, he says.

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Mishra says global linkages are the biggest concerns for listed companies. Around 53 percent of the aggregate revenues of the top BSE 100 companies come from outside India, he says.

On commodity side, oil prices edged away from multi-year lows as the northern hemisphere moves into the peak-demand winter season, but mild weather and ballooning supplies mean that prices are expected to remain generally low well into 2016. In unusually mild start to winter has dominated the northern hemisphere, caused in part by the El Nino weather phenomenon, keeping heating oil demand lower than the norm.

The weak winter demand is seen clashing with an expected rise in supplies once Iran's oil exports start to fully return after a lifting of western sanctions against Tehran.

Even though corrective plans were already getting implemented since more than a year ago; a warning letter means additional efforts are required. Management expects resolutions to happen in less than 12-15 months from now. US FDA inspected 10-12 facilities in the past 15 months (post Halol inspection) with no major observations. This provides comfort regarding business outlook for Ex-Halol US business. Warning letter status leads to ~6% and 3% cut in FY17/18E EPS, respectively. We estimate ~15% earnings cut if warning letter converts into import alert (low probability event in our sense).We have cut our FY17/18E EPS by 6% and 3%, respectively as we build a delay of 3-6 months in resolution of Halol facility. Though earnings impact would be limited (as the facility was already in the quasi warning letter state since last 15 months), we expect multiples to remain range bound in the near term. We maintain our Buy rating on SUNP but with lower TP of Rs875 @ 23x FY18EPER (vs Rs950 @ 27x 1H FY17E PER earlier).For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Moneycontrol BureauShares of Sun Pharma slumped over 7 percent intraday on Monday as investors grow cautious about a warning letter for its Halol manufacturing unit. The drug major has received a warning letter from the USFDA over violation of manufacturing norms in its facility at Halol in Gujarat. The warning letter follows inspection of the facility in September 2014 by US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) inspectors.However, most analysts are still bullish on the stock and are keenly waiting to for more details in the warning letter. Few analysts have lowered target price with a cautious outlook. Phillip Capital remains positive and advises to buy on dips stating that the issue may have more sentimental impact. It also adds that content of the warning letter will be key to future action in Sun Pharma, else it does not expect any major sales or margin implication.

The brokerage is pinning hopes on its anti-cancer drug Gleevec generic. It feels that timely Gleevec launch could surprise positively and except Gleevec there are no key injectable in near-term pipeline. ""It has enough time to go for site transfer for other drugs,"" Phillip Cap adds.

Sun Pharma's subsidiary received final approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for generic version of Gleevec, imatinib mesylate tablets 100mg and 400mg. CLSA says any weakness in Sun Pharma should be used as a buying opportunity but slashed target price per share. It feels that warning letter has a low probability of an import alert and expects earnings growth recovery from Q3FY16.

Retaining a buy rating, JM Financial sees the warning letter limited downside risk to its FY17 estimates. It has set a 14-15 percent growth estimate including Gleevec generic exclusivity. It also adds that reliance on Halol is limited to FY18 injectible filings.

Though Citi feels that the stock likely to remain weak until warning letter is public it does not see a big hit unless this escalates into an import alert. Import Alert may hit FY18 earnings per share (EPS) and target price by 15-16 percent and Rs 170 per share respectively. The brokerage has a buy rating with a target price of Rs 1020 per share.

However, Morgan Stanley is negative on the stock. It has downgraded Sun Pharma to equalweight and cut price target to Rs 762 from Rs 981 per share. It believes the stock may trade down and remain lacklustre for 6-9 months. ""Upcoming Gleevec launch in February 2016 could put a floor under the stock price,"" it adds.HSBC has downgraded it to hold with a reduced target of Rs 735 versus Rs 932 earlier. It says Halol warning letter could extend timeline for recovery in US biz and with two large companies Sun Pharma & Dr Reddy's under FDA warning there is potential for further sector de-rating.

Meanwhile, Nomura is neutral on the stock with a target price of Rs 817 per share but it does see the warning letter leading to an import alert. ""Import alert will cut EPS estimats by Rs 3 & Rs 4.5 per share. Warning Letter creates uncertainty on contribution from new approvals other than Gleevec generic,"" it adds.

Credit Suisse is also neutral on the stock with no change in estimates. It expects consensus to cut FY17 EPS by 10 percent and says that majority of investors were not factoring in a warning letter. Hence it sees consensus to cut FY17 EPS by 10 percent. At 09:27 hrs Sun Pharmaceutical Industries was quoting at Rs 739.05, down Rs 51.40, or 6.50 percent on the BSE.

Asian shares steadied in cautious early trade, as investors were reluctant to make any big moves amid volatile crude oil and before a widely anticipated US interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve later this week.

9:45 am Poll: The November Consumer Price Index (CPI) data that will be released today post market hours is expected to inch up as opposed to October.

Fitch said the pay hike could challenge the government's goal of achieving a fiscal deficit of 3.5 percent in the year ending in March 2017, unless India can cut spending or raise revenues.

Analysts say earnings growth and return to double digit sales growth is crucial for valuations to pick-up from here. Slowdown of the global economy (especially China), US rate hike, a stronger dollar and FII selling in emerging markets are key concerns haunting Indian market.

Analysts feel that the market is going through serious correction mode and will take time to stabilise. CNBC-TV18’s Udayan Mukherjee expects market to recover in next six months. He is bullish on midcaps and says the segment will take-off in mid-2016 and 2017.

Mukherjee says that besides subdued earnings, slow reforms pace by government in last one year has dampened market sentiments.

Ace trader Atul Suri says post the volatility opportunities will flow in and the current outperformers in volatile market will emerge as winners. He is bullish on midcap IT and pharmaceutical stocks and says that pharmaceutical is in multi-year bull market.

BuzzingAdding to the festive mood was government’s big push for FDI as it opened doors for foreign players by liberalising norms in15 sectors. Stocks in the banking, realty and media sector got a strong fillip in today’s trade riding on hopes for more foreign mullah.

Axis Bank, Sun Pharma, L&T, Tata Steel and BHEL were top gainers while Bharti, Hero, ITC and ONGC were losers in the Sensex. Media stocks like Zee Entertainment Enterprises, Hathway Cable and Den Networks were up 2-15 percent after government eased out FDI norms for the sector.

Market participants said profit-booking by speculators, who opened their new accounts on the first session of Samvat year 2072 and a weak trend overseas, mainly influenced gold prices at futures trade here.

The Butterfly Effect holds that a butterfly flapping its wings in some place can, in theory, cause a hurricane somewhere else weeks down the line. The term, coined by Edward Lorenz, came into vogue as weather forecasters saw that a small variation in initial atmospheric conditions can lead to completely unanticipated weather outcomes elsewhere.On 19 August, Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan flapped his wings and set off what could turn out to be a revolutionary storm in the Indian banking system - a storm bigger than the one created when private banks were first given licences in the 1990s.Eleven private parties were given licences to set up ""payment banks"" - banks which can do everything a regular bank can do - take deposits, pay bills, issue cheques and drafts, et al. The only thing they can't do is lend to you and me. Payment banks can only lend to the government and almost anybody with Rs 100 crore in his pocket can, in future, set up a payment bank, assuming they pass the RBI’s “fit and proper” norm (which basically means if you are not a crook, or someone who has cocked a snook at the regulator, you can get a licence). This means payment banks will theoretically be the safest of banks since they have only the government as borrower – and governments don’t default. In future, payment bank licences may be available on tap, and we could see even 50-100 such banks being set up. India will be fully banked over the next decade.That payment banking is a big deal is evident from who’s got the initial set of licences – the big boys and billionaires are there. Among them: the Aditya Birla Group, Reliance Industries (majority owner of Network 18, which publishes Firstpost), the big telcos (Airtel, Vodafone), the National Securities Depository (which holds almost all of India’s stocks in demat form, and provides the backbone for a tax information network), PayTM (India’s biggest mobile wallet company), Tech Mahindra (one of the Top Five IT companies in India), and Sun Pharma’s Dilip Shanghvi. Billionaires wouldn’t be filling in forms at the RBI’s window if they didn’t think payment banking was the in thing, though they might prefer to become regular banks, if that were possible. Since the RBI does not want corporates in banking, they are going for the next big thing that’s available – payment bank licences.The reasons why payment banking will revolutionise money movement are many. Consider the areas they will touch, and how their mere presence will impact everyone.First, and foremost, payment banks will bridge the last mile (or last 10-20 miles) between bank branches and the remote customer living in a rural hamlet. Payment banks will essentially rely on technology to reach payment services to all customers, using mobiles as the vehicle of banking. Mobiles go even where humans don’t. Physical bank branches (or bankers or ATMs) will still be needed for some functions - opening an account, depositing cash, etc - but all day-to-day payments, including peer-to-peer payments) can be done remotely. The mobile phone will become the virtual ATM and small-payments cheque-book. In less than 10 years, every Indian will have a bank account. Payment banks are the key enablers.

Second, banking costs will come down due to intense competition driven by the expected proliferation of payment banks. Currently, we pay through our noses for banking services, whether it is above-limit ATM transactions, additional cheque-books, big money transfers, maintenance of minimum balances, or draft issuance fees. These costs will come down as payment banks start offering zero-balance accounts and low-cost services. Currently, efficient private banks like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank make huge profits from their low-cost current and savings bank accounts, but a big chunk of this will move to payment banks, who may offer higher savings bank rates of 5-7 percent. The HDFCs mint money since they only have to compete with slothful public sector banks. Now, they will have nimbler rivals to worry about. The customer will finally be Queen.

Third, the public sector banks are sitting ducks for bankruptcy and taxpayer bailouts if they do not change. Between then, efficient payment and private sector banks will take away their lucrative businesses and prized customers, as they will be both well capitalised and efficient. The government should privatise the weaker banks quickly if it is not to be stuck with feeding white elephants permanently. It can’t cope with one Air India; if it does not privatise, it will have several Air Indias on its hands. The weaker public sector banks are dead ducks.

Fourth, the arrival of payment banks - including India Post - will transform social welfare and subsidy schemes. Even if the Modi government does no other reform but this one, government subsidy payments to the poor - whether for LPG, kerosene or even food and fertiliser - can now be routed through regular and payment banks. India Post is already there in places where banks aren't there (with over 1.5 lakh post offices), and tomorrow Airtel and Vodafone and Idea (and Reliance Jio, when it enters mobile telephony later this year) will reach customers through mobile-enabled payment systems. The holy triad of Jan Dhan no-frills bank accounts, Aadhaar IDs and mobile banking will enable direct payments to the poor, eliminating fake recipients, ensuring cash in zero-balance accounts, etc. Inclusive banking and subsidy reforms are simply the biggest things to happen during the Modi government, even though the seeds for this were planted by earlier governments. The difference between State Bank and Airtel is simply this: both have over 200 million customers, but Airtel can go where State Bank cannot with a branch.

Fifth, mobile banking will create the conditions for cash-less banking. This means, over time, the mobile will perform the same role as credit and debit cards, obviating the need for too many cash payments. Even ATM expansion can now be slowed down in cities, and focused on distant villages or towns.

Sixth, we now have one additional tool to eliminate black money in large parts of the financial system. A government that wants to eliminate black money - which the Modi government says it wants to - can effectively ban cash transactions once a 95 percent mobile and Jan Dhan penetration rate is achieved. India is close to reaching a mobile user base of one billion, and Jan Dhan is said to have reached all households. The next target for Jan Dhan should be universal adult coverage through mobile, payment banking. It is achievable in five to 10 years, with some public and private investment in financial literacy education and empowerment of rural citizens, especially women.

Seventh, the government will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of payment banking, as payment banks will expand its access to cheap funds. Currently, banks are the major investors in government bonds. While this will remain so even with the entry of payment banks, the sheer impact of additional money coming into payment bank accounts which can only invest in short-term government bills of up to one year's maturity means short-term rates will come down, and the government can borrow more cheaply.

Eighth, bank depositors can expect to earn higher short-terms deposit rates from payment banks, and the old 4 percent savings bank norm will probably fade away.

After payment banks, the RBI will license “small banks”, which have to focus loans on small borrowers and not big corporates. Once this happens, non-bank finance companies will become ""small banks"" and make financial inclusion more complete from the small borrower's point of view.

Between them, payments banks and small banks will make Indian banking more competitive and more inclusive on both the assets and liabilities sides – that is, for both depositors and borrowers. The era of the consumer is finally at hand.The writer is editor-in-chief, digital and publishing, Network18 Group."

Gold rose to its highest in nearly five weeks on Thursday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month signalled that a hike in US interest rates in September may be unlikely.

Fed officials worried that lagging US inflation and a weak global economy posed too big a risk to commit to a ""lift off"" on rates, buoying gold that had been out of favour amid an imminent tightening in US monetary policy.

The USD-INR currency pair has been no exception with the pair finally breaching the psychological 65/dollar figure tracking other Asian peers."" The dollar rose, getting a lift from data showing US housing starts neared an eight-year peak, which raised expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates as soon as next month.

China stocks continued their sell-off following a whopping 6 percent plunge in the previous session, underscoring that it won't be an easy return to good times for the country's equity market.

The market plunge yesterday was attributed to traders cutting back on expectations of more stimulus for the economy - on the back of better housing market data – and support for the stock market – after the China Securities Finance Corporation said it would not intervene further in the market unless there was unusual volatility and systemic risk.

Tumble in Chinese shares and weak earnings from Walmart pressured US stocks and copper prices saw six year lows. Investors will look to US inflation data and minutes of last month's Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, as they seek for further clues as to when the Fed will begin raising interest rates.

In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Patnaik says Nifty and Sensex will be impacted by China's yuan devaluation for the short-term atleast.

Pramit Brahmbhatt of Veracity said, ""The rupee is expected to remain under pressure following Yuan devaluation and daily fall. Selling pressure on equity market will fuel further weakness in rupee. During the day we expect the rupee to trade in a range of 64.80-65.40/dollar.""

The further devaluation of the yuan only added to further depreciation in the rupee, with the Indian currency hitting a 2-year low in trade today. The Indian currency is edging closer to the 65 to a dollar mark and adding to the sell-off is the fact that the rupee has been one of the outperformers in recent times.

Be prepared for more such surprise cuts says former head of IMF's China arm Eswar Prasad who believes that a strengthening dollar will only give the Chinese central bank more room to move aggressively. Back home the Finance Ministry is not taking the yuan devaluation lightly with the Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian saying policy makers across the world will have to take note and tweak their policies accordingly.

However, Ananth Narayan, Head, Financial Markets, Standard Chartered Bank says t is a good thing if the rupee depreciates to 65.0-65.50 to the US dollar, as our currency is still over valued in REER (real effective exchange rate) terms.

“Earlier, China was leading the pack. Now that China has moved, India stands out as a sore thumb as the most over valued currency among all major currencies,"" he says.

Meanwhile, it is party time for technology stocks as rupee loses its value. Infosys, TCS and Wipro were top gainers for second straight day. Sun Pharma and Lupin were other gainers in the Sensex.

Steel stocks also made good profit in an othewise downbeat market. In a bid to safeguard the steel industry from a cheaper yuan, government has hiked import duty on steel by 2.5 percent.

Government has taken several measures, including setting up of an inter-departmental committee to look into export-related issues and awareness programmes in emerging markets like Africa, to boost pharmaceutical exports. Pharmaceutical sector has huge potential in terms of increasing exports, the Commerce Ministry is taking many measures to boost overseas shipments, a ministry official said. The official said an inter-ministerial committee to resolve export-related issues has been set up.

Besides, the ministry has prepared a 'guidance document on pharma procurement' to help authorities in Africa, Latin America and South Asia in their purchasing programmes. Awareness programmes about Indian pharma industry have also been started in these markets and workshops are being organised with USFDA for Indian drug regulators and the industry. Recently, the Indian pharma industry has been facing the heat from the US Food and Drug Administration for non-compliance of regulatory framework.

In the recent past, many domestic generic drug makers, including Sun Pharma and Wockhardt, have faced actions. The Commerce Ministry is depending on the sector to boost the country's exports, which are in the negative zone since December last year. India's pharma exports grew by about 3 per cent to USD 15.34 billion in 2014-15.

According to a foreign trade policy statement, the pharmaceutical sector is beset with several challenges. Most of these challenges arise out of the enviable reputation of India as a reliable supplier of generic medicines. ""Awareness programmes and workshops with drug regulators will help us in dealing with these challenges,"" the official added.

The challenges include campaigns to malign generic products as being in violation of India's IPR commitments; alleged lack of compliance of generic medicines coming out of India, with quality standards; India's over dependence on some sources for its active pharmaceutical ingredients; and India's pricing policies forcing Indian exporters to price their products with extremely low margins. To ensure traceability and tracking of the drugs manufactured in India, bar-coding for all exports except primary level packaging have been made compulsory from July 1. Pharma exports account for 10 per cent of the global market by volume and 1.4 per cent by value.

The industry is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.5 per cent over 2009-2020 to reach USD 55 billion."

9:50 am Market view: James Glassman, senior economist at JP Morgan thinks the markets are paying too much attention to the Greek issue and should instead focus on other growth stories. For example India has been showing good performance and FY16 is expected to be a good year for it. In the developed economies too the Central Banks are trying to speed up things, says Glassman.

He does not expect major volatility in global markets because of Greece defaulting on IMF debt. According to him there was never a fear of Greece exiting Eurozone since the Greek voters had always indicated that they wanted to remain in the European Union.

Total income declined by 11.1 percent quarter-on-quarter (up 51.7 percent on yearly basis) to Rs 6,157 crore during January-March quarter, the company said in its filing.

However, analysts do not seem to be perturbed. Macquaire has an outperform rating with a target price of Rs 1100 per share. With strong execution, free cash flow and a niche pipeline, Sun Pharma should sustain the upper-end of its historical premium valuation, says the brokerage. Ranbaxy integration provides an additional lever for growth, over the medium-term, it adds.

Lower aviation fuel costs had helped the airline company narrow net loss in March quarter to Rs 1,728.99 crore in Q4FY15. Fall in expenses and higher income from operations also aided.

Analysts say the market is concerned about rising bond yields in Europe. German and US bond yields surged to their highest in more than five months, making equities look more expensive in comparison to debt and keeping Asian stock markets subdued.

Sandeep Bhatia, executive director, Kotak Institutional Equities feels the Nifty may slip below the 8000 mark and a good entry point for investors is 7800 on Nifty. He expects more earnings headwind the next quarter. The next round of positive trigger will be both the houses of the Parliament passing the Land Bill and GST Bill, he says.

Meanwhile, India VIX rose on worries about key land and tax reforms, and retrospective taxation of foreign investors.

On the macro front, wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation for April fell to a new low of -2.65 percent, the sixth successive month of deflating prices. The WPI reading for March was -2.33 percent. Some experts say this is a clear sign of deflationary trend in the economy, and calls for some radical action by the policy makers. This is fifth successive month of negative WPI after the flat reading for November.

The euro rose above USD 1.14, bringing its gains against the US currency in the last month to nearly 9 percent as the difference between benchmark US and euro zone 10-year yields shrinks from the euro-lifetime high touched in March."

11:50 am Outlook: Moody's said India's credit rating was unlikely to be impacted by the recently strong foreign investor sales of shares and bonds over concerns about a tax on overseas funds, despite the uncertainty being created over the country's tax regime. ""India's external balances are strong relative to peers on some accounts, and can withstand the current outflows, for instance, due to the high level of foreign-exchange reserves,"" Thomas Rookmaaker, director at Fitch's Asia-Pacific Sovereign Group, wrote in an email to Reuters. Fitch affirmed its ""BBB-minus"" and ""stable"" outlook on India last month. Meanwhile, Moody's, which revised India's ""Baa3"" sovereign rating outlook to ""positive"" from ""stable"" last month, said its outlook reflects a 2-5 year horizon, rather than near-term growth outlook.

The stock gained 3 percent as its Q4 profit rose a whopping 60.5 percent, supported by higher volumes and favorable foreign exchange. The profit increased to Rs 1,284 crore from Rs 800 crore in the year-ago period. Strong operational performance also boosted bottomline.

Meanwhile, Bharti Airtel slipped 3 percent ahead of announcing Q4 results tommorow. Analysts expect another lacklustre quarter for Bharti's Africa business; in fact this could be the weakest quarter historically.

Sharp depreciation of African currencies may impact the performance. Hence, dollar revenue may show a sharp decline. Citi estimates a 7.5 percent Q-o-Q decline while Kotak expects a 5 percent de-growth.

Mark Mobius of Franklin Templeton Investments remains bullish on Indian equities despite the recent dip and expects about 12-15 percent annualised returns from India.

The only dark cloud, according to him, is the recent development on minimum alternate tax demand on FIIs. He says this is a major issue for portfolio investors and if not resolved, FIIs could look elsewhere.

The rupee recovered after breaching 63-mark in morning trade and touching intraday lows of 63.15 against the dollar, the lowest level since January 8. The rupee recovered as exporters and state-run banks sold dollars.

1:50 pm Exclusive: The central government has floated a tender to invite bids for third-party verification of implementation of financial restructuring plans. As many as eight state discoms are part of this FRP plan.

The third party verification of financial restructuring plan (FRP) for the state discoms is part of the monitoring of FRP which was approved by the Cabinet in 2012. The crucial role of FRP Consultant will be to verify the achievements and compliance of all the conditions which were put up under the FRP plan which was approved by the Cabinet.

This will include record of AT&C losses reduction, which is aggregate technical and commercial losses of electricity. The consultant will also have to verify from commission orders the subsidy, average cost of supply and average revenue realised because the whole intention of FRP plan was to reduce the gap between average revenue realised by the state discoms along with average cost of supply.

1:30 pm Gold special: Gold prices fell marginally by 0.15 percent to Rs 26,797 per ten grams in futures trade as speculators trimmed their positions, taking weak cues from the global markets.

However, token buying by retailers in the spot markets on the auspicious occasion of ""Akshaya Tritiya"" day limited the losses. At the spot markets, gold traded lower at Rs 27,200 per ten grams in opening trade at Chennai.

Analysts said the fall in yellow metal prices at futures trade was mostly in tandem with a weak trend overseas but token buying by retailers at spot markets on account of Akshaya Tritiya, considered to be most auspicious day for buying gold and silver, restricted the fall.

11:45 am Akshaya Tritiya special: Most commodity experts believe there is not too much gains that one can make buying gold now. If one had bought gold a year back then your wealth would have been eroded by almost 7 percent and if one had bought Gold ETP, your returns would have been eroded by almost 11 percent. So, is gold loosing its glitter and its safe haven quality? What should be your strategy on gold going forward?

According to Victor Thianpiriya, commodity strategist, ANZ Research, gold will still make a positive investment over the next two -three years and global gold prices could head to USD 1100 per ounce levels over the next few months.

However, for the near-term there is no conviction that prices would go a lot higher and niether is conviction that prices would go lower. So, we are still waiting for the key events on what happens with Greece and with what happens with US monetary policy, says Thianpiriya.

11:30 am Earnings poll: Wipro will announce its fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday. India's third-largest IT services exporter is likely to report a 0.2 percent decline in dollar revenues, according to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

On Monday, fears of retrospective taxation triggering an outflow from foreign portfolio investors slashed 555 points off the BSE benchmark. Nevertheless, Mobius does not find it unusual to see sharp corrections in a bull market. ""Earlier a 10 percent slide would rattle markets, but not anymore,"" he said adding that a further cut of over 5-10 percent won't be unexpected. ""This is just a correction and not a bear market.

12:30pm Economic Growth: The Indian economy is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 7.1 percent through 2019, but reform measures announced by the government are ""no more than incremental improvements"", the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) has said.

EIU, which is the research-arm of the London-based publication, The Economist, credited strengthening of the economy to lower oil prices, saying this has eased structural problems associated with high inflation.

""In its first full Budget the government pledged more money for much-needed roads and railways and cut some red tape for entrepreneurs.

It relaxed slightly some fiscal deficit targets and increased spending on welfare. All of these moves are positive, but are no more than incremental improvements. Owing to a new government methodology for calculating GDP, we now expect growth of 7.1 percent a year in 2015-19, a full percent age point higher than earlier,"" the EIU global forecast report said.

The country recently switched to a newer system of GDP growth computation, which made it the fastest growing major economy in the world. Analysts still take the numbers with caution owing to absence of comparable back data.

By being the first major company to report fourth-quarter numbers, TCS will for the first time also don the mantle of being the company that “unofficially kick-starts” the earnings season. For many years now till the last quarter, this job was done by Infosys, the company TCS has raced past by on revenues, valuation and brand metrics in the past few years (the former has said it would announce results on April 24).

At the current market price of Rs 52.80 apiece, sale of about 15 crore shares would garner around Rs 800 crore for the exchequer.

The government currently holds 89.93 percent stake in the state-run trading giant and the stake sale would help the company meet Sebi's minimum public shareholding norm. Market regulator Sebi has made it mandatory to have a minimum public holding of 25 percent in all PSUs.

The stake sale proceeds would help the government inch towards the disinvestment target of Rs 41,000 crore fixed for the current fiscal. So far, it has already raised Rs 1,550 crore through 5 percent stake dilution in REC. The government had last sold 9.33 percent stake in MMTC in June 2013 through which it had raised about Rs 570 crore.

02:25pm Earnings: IndusInd Bank matched street expectations on Thursday with the fourth quarter (January-March) net profit rising 25.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 495.3 crore. Asset quality of the bank improved too, during the quarter.

Net interest income was slightly lower than expectations at Rs 925.14 crore in quarter ended March 2015, up 18.4 percent compared to Rs 781.2 crore in the year-ago period. Net interest income is the difference between interest earned and interest expended. According to CNBC-TV18 poll, NII was expected at Rs 941.5 crore for the quarter.

The profit was boosted by strong other income and lower provisions. Other income (non-interest income) jumped 26 percent year-on-year to Rs 658.48 crore crore while operating expenses climbed 25.3 percent to Rs 733.11 crore during January-March quarter. Other income was largely driven by fee income that jumped 29 percent.

Provisions for bad loans dropped 10.9 percent on yearly basis (up 9.6 percent sequentially) to Rs 107.44 crore in the fourth quarter of financial year 2014-15.

The bank reported good improvement in its asset quality performance as gross non-performing assets (NPA) declined to 0.81 percent in March quarter from 1.05 percent in previous quarter and 1.12 percent in the year-ago quarter. Net NPA stood at 0.31 percent during the quarter against 0.32 percent Q-o-Q and 0.33 percent Y-o-Y.

Shares of Tata Motors, Sun Pharma, Axis Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra, BHEL, Hero Motocorp, Wipro and Bharti Airtel plunged 2-4 percent. However, ITC, SBI, ONGC and Sesa Sterlite bucked the trend, rising 1-2.5 percent.

03:10pm Info Edge rallies: Info Edge has corrected in the past few months. UBS thinks its risk-reward profile is attractive at the current level.

The brokerage upgraded the stock from neutral to buy and raised its price target from Rs 950 to Rs 1,000.

Info Edge is a major company in the online classifieds market. Naukri, India's No 1 job portal, remains its key revenue and earnings source. The company has been investing aggressively in 99acres, given big upside potential in online real estate classifieds. Zomato, its food portal, is also doing well.

Amid increasing competition in the online food discovery and ordering segment in India, Zomato is set to launch its food ordering application for restaurants in Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore, as per media articles.

UBS said this is a positive for Info Edge, as it indicates a robust monetisation strategy on top of strong business growth. It expects proceeds from the recent round of capital-raising to fund the required expenditure.

The government exempted upstream companies from sharing Q4 under-recovery burden and will also exempt upstream oil companies from any burden sharing for LPG under direct benefit transfer for FY16, said sources.

However, CNBC-TV18 also learnt that upstream companies may have to share only kerosene under-recovery burden in FY16.

According to sources, LPG subsidy for FY16 is likely to be Rs 22,000 crore and the government does not expect too much burden on kerosene under-recovery in FY16.

Shares of ONGC gained 3.5 percent and Oil India rallied nearly 7 percent.

02:20pm Europe Update: European shares hit a 14-year high today before a meeting at which the European Central Bank is expected to affirm its loose policy stance, as weak data from China raised prospects of monetary easing there too.

Financial markets remain driven by policy action from the world's major central banks, with Tuesday's softer US retail sales supporting the view that the Federal Reserve will not rush to raise interest rates in June.

The ECB is almost certain to keep rates unchanged at record lows at its meeting later in the day, and also tipped to quash talk it might scale down sooner than planned the 1 trillion euro quantitative easing scheme it launched last month.

A banking source told Reuters on Tuesday the ECB raised the cap on emergency liquidity assistance that Greek banks can draw from the country's central bank, taking some of the heat off Athens.

Data earlier in the day showed growth in China's economy slowed to a six-year low of 7 percent in the first quarter. That was better than many feared after a woeful trade performance in March.

But both retail sales and industrial output missed forecasts, with the latter expanding at the slowest pace since the global financial crisis in 2008, intensifying Beijing's struggle to find the right policy mix to shore up activity.

""There are many policy measures and many things that we have to do over a period of time, if indeed India has to become a leading global economy... We have to make it possible for our capital markets to be broader, deeper and for that to happen, capital account convertibility also becomes important,"" Sinha told reporters.

Crude oil prices climbed in Asia for a fifth-straight trading day today following forecasts that US shale production could decline and help ease a global supply glut, analysts said.

The US Energy Information Administration said on Monday that output from the country’s seven shale regions, which has driven production to a record high, looked set to fall by 57,000 barrels per day in May.

Analysts said a decline should help ease the global crude oversupply, which led to a collapse in prices of more than 50 percent between June and January."

“We have actually seen quite a lot of inflows over the past few months into bonds especially fixed income.

02:50pm Rajan talks to CNBC-TV15: The outlook upgrade is a positive perception of what we have done over the past few quarters. Presumably Moody’s sees this as a first step to rating upgrade, said Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan.

He, however, cautions that the government and regulators should not lose sight on what more needs to be done. “We should not celebrate upgrades as we did not worry about downgrades. There are a lot of low-hanging fruits that need to be picked,” Rajan said in an exclusive interview to CNBC-TV18.

The RBI left the key interest rates unchanged at its bi-monthly review on April 7, after effecting two out-of-cycle rate cuts earlier this year for 25 basis points (0.25 percent) each.

Rajan said the quality of fiscal spending, which has been subdued over the last few years, is more important. The state of economy is weak and a high quality fiscal spending can be a good thing, but ramping it up will take some time.

On inflation, Rajan said that the country is still not out of woods and he would be happy to see more steps on fiscal consolidation.

12:30pm Market Expert: Investors should look at a mix of infrastructure and consumer themes, says Nilesh Shah, Managing Director and CEO, Envision Capital. He sees real estate stocks as contrarian bets.

In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Shah says GST is critical to India's growth and once effective, it could do wonders to India's economy.

He says the foundation of the current bull market was laid 18 months ago, and that the big challenge before the government now is to revive growth.

Shah says India's fortunes are largely linked to its infrastructure development. However, he feels private investment in infrastructure could take time to revive, and so it is important that public spending takes off in a big way.

Shah sees the effective execution of the JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhar, Mobile) kickstarting rural consumption in a big way.

According to Shah, demographics and urbanisation are the key driverrs of the economy and he expects India o outperform other markets for years to come.

09:40am Tax Notice: In the biggest-ever tax demand slapped on them, nearly 100 foreign funds have been asked to cough up an estimated USD 5-6 billion for 'untaxed gains' made by them in the Indian markets over the past years.

The number of affected investors can rise substantially as assessments are still in progress and notices could be served in many more cases, taking the overall tax demand from them to well over USD 10 billion, sources said.

Spooked by these ""retrospective"" notices and assessment orders, the foreign investors have begun lobbying intensely with the policy makers and regulators, while stating that the move goes against the government's stated position of providing a 'non-adversarial and stable tax regime'.

The FIIs have, however, decided to challenge the tax demands, stating that MAT cannot be levied on FIIs or FPIs as they do not earn any 'business income' in India and their income is defined as 'capital gains' under the I-T Act.

11:45am Angel on Ipca import alert: The USFDA has imposed import alerts on Silvassa and Indore (formulation facilities for US) for IPCA.

""Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate and Propanolol Hydrochloride, which accounted for around 45 percent of its total US sales in FY2014, are exempted from the ban. With this all the key US facilities of the company are under USFDA import alert. In FY2014 US contributed sales of Rs 419.6 crore (12 percent of total sales and 20 percent of exports, with Formulation: API mix of around 61:39). Now on back of the ban, around Rs 231 crore worth of sales will be impacted,"" said Sarabjit Kour Nangra, VP Research - Pharma, Angel Broking.

""Whilst we are negatively surprised by the import alerts, we believe that now IPCA will have to follow the measures laid out by the US FDA to resolve the issue. We have cut the FY2016 EPS numbers by 20 percent. Though the timelines of the resolve are uncertain, we believe the size of the company, and low dependence on US, along with Indian geographies outperforming the market growth, the company can easily sustain a 15-18 percent growth in sales and hence a significant downside is limited. Any downside can be used by investors to buy into the stock, with a long term view on the stock. We remain neutral on the stock,"" she added.

Over the last year, HDIL has reduced its debt by nearly Rs 685 crore to Rs 3,142.4 crore as of December 2014.

“The decision to put on block the industrial land parcel in Gujarat is in sync with the Company’s strategy of exiting non-core assets and consolidating our core business. Our objective is to reduce debt and streamline the operations”, said Hariprakash Pandey, Vice-President, Finance and Investor Relations, HDIL.

12:40pm Bonds in action post rate cut: Government bonds surged to their highest in nearly 20 months while the rupee jumped to a one-month high today after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lowered interest rates, in a move that came earlier than expected.

The RBI lowered its key policy repo rate by 25 basis points to 7.5 percent, its second inter-meeting cut this year on the back of easing inflation and what it said was the ""weak state"" of parts of the economy.

The move was also seen as backing the government's budget unveiled on Saturday, which pledged fiscal responsibility but delayed meeting a fiscal deficit target of 3 percent of gross domestic product by a year to fiscal year 2017/18.

The Reserve Bank of India caught markets off guard, just as it did in January when it made the last interest rate cut, as traders had expected the central bank to wait until a scheduled policy review on April 7.

11:50 am Macro economy: Former RBI governor C Rangarajan feels inflation targeting is a good idea, and it enhances the autonomy of the RBI. Rangarajan said the inflation targeting arrangement gives RBI the flexibility to use any tool it deems fit to bring inflation under control.

JP Morgan’s Jahangir Aziz says central banks in some countries have had to answer the governments if the inflation target was missed for three quarters in a row.

He said the arrangement gives a fair degree of independence to the RBI, and said this will also lead to greater scrutiny of the Monetary Policy Committee’s decisions.

11:30 am FII view: With the Budget behind, investors are now looking forward to the Budget session in Parliament, where the government is expected to push through four crucial legislations, including on insurance, coal mining and land acquisition, Deutsche Bank MD and head of research Abhay Laijawala told CNBC-TV18 in an interaction from the sidelines of a conference the investment bank is holding in India.

“The mood at the conference is cautiously optimistic [with respect to the Budget session],” Laijawala told Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy, but he added that post the Budget the mood had definitely shifted in favour of cyclical stocks. “Some of the measures announced in the Budget – the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund or the plug-and-play model (for power projects – were brilliant,” he said.

“We will be achieving higher milestones this year. I am extremely bullish on the prospects of the market,” he told CNBC-TV18. He sees Nifty at 11000 by this year-end. As far as this Budget goes, there is no cause for concern, he says. For a while, the Budget was being pointed to as a probable cause for a big drop in Nifty, it in fact has removed the probability of it happening, he adds.

In the private banking space, he says there is a clear shift of preference. The patronage has shifter from ICICI Bank to Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. He believes Jubilant Foodworks is a better buy than Just Dial.

What a wild swing! The market swung along some 678 points intraday, with some late buying that saved the day. After a lot of volatility, the Nifty ended at a month-high closing level. The 50-share index closed up 57.25 points or 0.6 percent at 8901.85 while the Sensex was up 141.38 points or 0.5 percent at 29361.50. About 1241 shares advanced, 1494 shares declined.

Investors had pinned a lot of hope for more reforms in the Budget 2015 presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and enthusiastic trading took the Sensex up almost 400 points in early trade. The Nifty, too, climbed the 8900-level peak much before the FM’s Budget proposal speech. However, things did not remain so rosy as soon the FM announced some excise duty hikes.

An excise duty hike by 15 percent for cigarettes took a toll on index heavyweight ITC, knocking off some 9 percent intraday. Not only that, the government has also proposed an excise duty raise by 25 percent for 65mm cigarettes and on tobacco increased to Rs 70/kg from Rs 60/kg.

The market soon started to spiral down falling almost 200-points as a knee-jerk reaction as investors seemed to be looking for more big bang announcements from the Modi government’s first full year Budget. However, aggressive buying in banks, pharma, oil & gas, auto and IT stocks brought the market back to green with the Nifty reclaiming 8900-level.

The government’s decision to defer the much-dreaded General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR) by two years gave much relief to foreign investors which was when market started to turn green after the knee-jerk negative reaction to Budget proposals. GAAR was earlier purposed to kick-start from April 1, 2015.

Market experts see it to be a well-balanced Budget and expect it to give some legs to the rally on Monday. Adrian Mowat of JPMorgan feels there is a lot in this Budget the people will like and as Modi was highlighting it is about giving us clarity over the next four years. Ramesh Damani, Member, BSE also agrees that it may not be a big bang Budget but it seems like a big bold Budget. “I would give the Finance Minister high marks for restructuring the corporate tax rates doing away with the wealth tax,” he said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

However, Ajay Srivastava, CEO of Dimensions Consulting warns that the market will be correcting a little bit definitely in the next seven days or so because there are a lot of expectations built around a couple of sectors that has come down. “We will start to see impact of company valuations and fundamentals coming to the market more than liquidity. Expectations are over, the reality is now when the new cost comes to hit the real estate, infrastructure companies what happens to their earnings dynamics and that will be a negative,” he said.

Meanwhile, Jaitley pegged fiscal deficit for 2015-16 at 3.9 percent of GDP and proposed to lower it to 3 percent by 2017-18, a year later than planned earlier. Unveiling the roadmap for fiscal consolidation while presenting the Budget 2015-16, he said the 3 percent fiscal deficit target will now be achieved in three years. He also said that Current Account Deficit (CAD) will be less than 1.3 percent of GDP.

Gainers & losers

Such a volatile when an index heavyweight like ITC ended the day with a steep lose of 8 percent, Axis Bank gained a whopping 9 percent.

Late bloom in banking stocks took Bank Nifty up over 3 percent at close. HDFC Bank, SBI, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra gained 1-5 percent each. BHEL, NTPC, Hindalco and HDFC were laggards in the Sensex. Among the midcap stocks, HMT, PC Jeweller, Chambal Fertiliser, Punj Lloyd and Rallis India were top performers."

11:40 am Budget expectations: Mahesh Nandurkar, CLSA says opinion polls suggest that the upcoming elections in Delhi might throw a negative surprise for Narendra Modi.

“If that happens, it will be a small negative for the market, though we do not believe that one small election loss will impact Mr Modi's policy making,” he adds.

He says CLSA believes the upcoming Budget will give a boost to infrastructure spending and yet drive fiscal consolidation. The brokerage also believes that the translation of improving macro into better corporate results is a matter of time and a potential near-term weakness will be a buying opportunity.

Rebound in domestic gas production and LNG regasification capacity expansions are at least two years away. A turnaround in this business will be crucial for Gail to sustain its high valuations,” it says in a note.

Sources say as recently as last week, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has proposed upstream companies ONGC and Oil India should not make any contributions towards subsidy burden if crude prices are at or below USD 60 per barrel. They will, however, take upon 85 percent of the burden if crude ranged between USD 60 and 100 and 90 percent if oil stays above USD 100.

11:55 am India PMI: Growth in India's factory activity slipped in January from December's two-year high as new orders rose at a weaker rate despite factories keeping price increases to a minimum, a business survey showed on Monday.

Cooling growth and inflation could give the Reserve Bank of India reason to cut interest rates again in the coming months but any move may depend on the government's annual budget due on Feb. 28.

The HSBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, fell to a three-month low of 52.9 in January from December's two-year high of 54.5.

Despite falling from December’s two-year record of 54.5 to 52.9, the headline HSBC India Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) remained consistent with a solid improvement in business conditions in January.

PMI is a seasonally adjusted indicator designed to give an accurate overview of manufacturing operating conditions.

Moreover, the latest expansion was the fifteenth in as many months. Sector data highlighted consumer goods as the best performing of the three market groups for the third month in a row, says HSBC in its report.

""Manufacturing activity continued to signal improvement in January, though the rate of growth slipped to a three-month low. The slip can partly be attributed to consolidation after two months of impressive upticks,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC.

""New orders, both from domestic and international sources, also continued to grow, though at a slower pace than in December. New orders were strongest in the consumer goods sector. On the inflation front, growth in input and output prices moderated further due to cheaper commodity prices,"" he added.

""Sluggish growth and falling inflation further reinforces our view that the RBI should deliver upfront rate cuts. We expect the repo rate to be lowered by 75bp in the first half of 2015,"" said Pranjul.

9:50 am Big move: Shares of Jet Airways soared 5.5 percent while beleaguered SpiceJet jumped 7 percent intraday as aviation turbine fuel (ATF) is slashed by a steep 11.3 percent which now costs lesser than diesel.

The price of ATF, or jet fuel, in Delhi was cut by Rs 5,909.9 per kilolitre, or 11.27 per cent, to Rs 46,513.02 per kl, oil companies announced.

Last month's reduction saw the ATF price slip to Rs 52.42 a litre, below Rs 58.91 a litre cost of petrol in Delhi. Post this cut it costs Rs 46.51 per litre and is cheaper than diesel that sells at Rs 51.52 per litre.

ATF has a higher octane than petrol and diesel is a heavier fraction in the distillation process. Traditionally, auto fuels being of lesser quality than ATF, would cost less. ATF attracts an excise duty of 8 percent. Jet fuel constitutes over 40 percent of an airline's operating costs and the price cut will ease the financial burden of cash-strapped carriers.

Drug major Sun Pharma's top executive Dilip S Shanghvi expects the USD 4-billion Ranbaxy deal to be concluded by middle of next month while stating that the key challenge before the combined entity would be to rebuild the confidence of health regulators. ""I think Punjab and Haryana High Court will hear the issue of merger on February 2. Once we get the approval (from the court), then it will take a few more days. We need to meet certain company laws. So, hopefully by middle of February we should be able to close the deal,"" Sun Pharma Managing Director Dilip S Shanghvi told reporters here. ""Of course... I think more than anything else the ability to regain the confidence and trust of the regulator is the most important challenge for us,"" he said when asked about the USFDA ban on Ranbaxy facilities.

The FDA has imposed a ban on the drugs produced at Ranbaxy's plants in India to the US. Later the company faced overseas troubles in Europe where it has been barred from exporting certain antibiotics produced at its Dewas plant to Germany for non-compliance to 'good manufacturing practices' norms by German health regulator. ""If this merger happens by February then we will announce result of the combined entity for fourth quarter,"" Shanghvi said on the sidelines of release of a book by founder of Dr Reddy's Laboratories Late Dr K Anji Reddy 'An Unfinished Agenda: My Life in the Pharmaceutical Industry'. In April last year, Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy had announced that they entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which Sun Pharma will acquire 100 per cent of Ranbaxy in an all-stock transaction in a USD 4-billion deal. Sun Pharma had earlier said it would try to leverage Ranbaxy's strong presence in some of the geographies where it was not present. Recently in a joint statement, the two firms had said that they have received the CCI order where acquisition of Ranbaxy by Sun Pharma has been approved ""subject to compliance with certain conditions"". The country's competition regulator, which has ordered Ranbaxy to sell six products and Sun Pharma to divest one, had said it would also appoint a monitoring committee to oversee compliance to the conditions put forth by it to ensure that the merger does not hit competition."

The downtrend could persist next week followed the disastrous October IIP figure of negative 4.2 percent announced post market Friday. While inflation continued to drift lower, weakness in industrial output during the festive season is clearly a cause for concern.

Tata Steel, Sesa Sterlite, GAIL, BHEL, JSPL, Reliance and ONGC, L&T, Cairn India and Infosys slid between 6-12.5 percent lower, faring among biggest Nifty losers this week.

Sun Pharma, Coal India, UltraTech Cement, ITC bucked the trend, gaining between 1-2.4 percent this week.

Weakness was ubiquitous this week, with broader markets at the center of profit-taking. BSE Small Cap and CNX Midcap indices were down 3.4-3.8 percent, performing slightly better than the benchmarks.

Diamond Power, Bombay Burmah, HCL Info, Havells, India Cements, HDIL, Rel Comm, HCC and Unitech lost between 10-43 percent on the bourses, on a weekly basis. Investors booked profits this week amid weak global cues and mixed signals domestically. The start of the week saw India's current account deficit widen to US$10.1bn in the second quarter of 2014-15 from US$7.8bn (1.7% of GDP) in the preceding quarter. A bump in imports and slowing of exports led to the widening of the gap. The Finance Minister however said there was no cause for concern since FII and FDI flows were adequate to finance the deficit.

Globally, Chinese benchmark Shanghai Composite fell almost 6 percent sending shockwaves in the region in particular and the rest of the world in general. The blame was put on new restrictions imposed by the government on corporate bond market and subdued growth outlook for the country.

Stocks of metal companies, which depend on exports to China took a beating owing to weakness in China.

The scenario wasn't all rosy back home either as some of the founders sold their stake in the blue-chip software behemoth -Infosys- which gently rattled investor sentiment and caused turmoil in benchmark indices on that day, somewhat setting a precedent for profit taking for the week ahead.

Government's reforms agenda has taken a blow on the chin, as latest reports from CNBC-TV18 suggest that the much awaited GST Bill might be tabled in the budget session of the parliament in 2015 and not in the ongoing winted session, owing to ongoing differences between centre and states on inclusion of petroleum in the bill's ambit among other issues.

This weakness hasn't deterred Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint MD, Motilal Oswal, who in an interview with CNBC-TV18 that market could see a correction near term, but it made sense only for traders to book profits now and get in at lower prices. For those looking to benefit from the secular bull market over the next few years, it would pay to sit tight and ignore market fluctuations.

Energy stocks slumped as oil prices hit five and half year lows even as IEA lowered it's demand outlook. Brent crude which was last seen trading at USD63-a-barrel, has dropped 40 percent since July. BSE oil & gas index lost 7.3 percent owing to a weak demand.

Post the important approval, the acquisition now becomes a mere formality and analysts expect the deal to conclude in less than six months outlined by the CCI for the two firms to meet some conditions with respect to divestiture of certain drugs.

With the cloud of uncertainty vanishing from over the deal, traders can look to exploit an arbitrage opportunity between Sun and Ranbaxy shares.

According to an HSBC report, based on the merger ratio of 0.8 between the two firms, there is a 5 percent arbitrage between the two stocks. That is, Ranbaxy shareholders would get 0.8 shares of Sun in lieu of each Ranbaxy share held.

At the time of this writing, Sun shares were trading at Rs 845 per share. Based on the merger ratio, Ranbaxy should trade at about Rs 675 but in Mumbai trading today, the stock was at Rs 643, implying a discount of about 5 percent.

Traders can play this by buying Ranbaxy futures.

On account on uncertainty on how the final contours of the deal would look like, the discount between Sun and Ranbaxy had widened to about 15 percent as recently as last month. (On November, Sun traded at Rs 850 while Ranbaxy was at 593).

This gap has narrowed and will likely reduce further ahead.

“I don’t know why and why investors were so pessimistic [so as to drive the discount to such levels last month],” Prabhudar Lilladher pharma analyst Surajit Pal told CNBC-TV18 this morning. “The arbitrage opportunity – when people bought Sun Pharma shares instead of Ranbaxy -- was too much. That is narrowing.”

Independently, too, most analysts have been bullish on Sun Pharma and after the deal’s announcement, on Ranbaxy as well, as they repose faith in Sun management’s ability to fix Ranbaxy’s quality issues that have got the company into a tangle with the US FDA.

HSBC has on overweight rating on both stocks."

9:50 am FII view: Macro headwinds globally could cause volatility in equity markets, feels Arvind Sanger of Geosphere Capital.

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, he says India was still the brightest spot globally among equity markets. He does not expect the Indian market correcting more than 5-10 percent at worst. He sees the slowdown in China continuing and Europe, Japan being under pressure in 2015. Sanger is bullish on PSU banks selectively even though sentiment for this space is negative right now. He sees some more weakness as PSU banks dilute equity to raise capital, but feels that would be a good opportunity to start accumulating them. He feels PSU banks will do well as interest rates keep falling.

French bank Societe Generale has decided to suspend its involvement as an adviser in raising finance for the city-headquartered GVK group's Hancock Coal project in Australia.According to a statement in the official twitter account of the French bank, ""delay"" in executing the project is the main reason for its opting out.

""In the context of the Alpha Coal project's delay, Societe Generale has decided, in agreement with GVK-Hancock, to suspend its mandate. The bank has therefore no involvement with the project,"" the Paris-based lender said.

Reacting to the announcement, GVK Hancock today said, ""GVK Hancock has been working with Societe Generale on a specific element of the financing arrangements for ourprojects, but is not currently working on that specific work package and as such does not require their services at this time.

""The key focus for our projects at this point in time is finalising our approvals and addressing litigious challenges to our attained approvals,"" said Josh Euler, manager,corporate affairs, GVK Hancock Coal Pty Ltd.

The Sensex fell 325.43 points or 1.14 percent to 28132.67 and the Nifty dropped 96.35 points or 1.13 percent to 8441.95. About 1052 shares have advanced, 1815 shares declined, and 119 shares are unchanged.

In a big boost to ONGC, the Oil Ministry is reworking the fuel subsidy sharing formula to cut its payout by a quarter through adjustment of statutory oil cess against its share.

According to a new subsidy sharing formula, the payout of upstream oil producers like ONGC is to be reduced to the extent of Rs 4,500 per tonne oil development cess they pay to the government, sources privy to the development said.

The move to lessen the subsidy burden will give a flip to government's plan to sell 5 percent stake in Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) to garner about Rs 17,000 crore.

The cess in current fiscal will total Rs 10,500 crore and after accounting for Rs 31,926 crore that upstream firms ONGC and Oil India (OIL) have already paid in fuel subsidy in first half, their payout in remainder of the current fiscal will be no more than Rs 8,000 crore, reports PTI.

Current account deficit for Q2FY15 will be announced later in the day today. According to the estimates of economists polled by CNBC-TV18, CAD could widen to around USD 10 billion in Q2 compared to USD 7.8 billion in previous quarter.

This is assuming widening of the trade deficit sequentially to USD 37.3 bilion in Q2FY15 from USD 33.1 billion, along with accounting for trade surplus in services at USD 17.8 billion and assuming remittances and investment came in unchanged Q-o-Q.

02:30pm Sesa Sterlite under pressure

Brokerage house Bank of America Merrill Lynch has cut its earnings estimates for metal and mining major Sesa Sterlite, and also the price target, citing falling crude and iron ore prices.

The brokerage has lowered earnings estimates for FY15-FY16 by 10-33 percent, and price target to Rs 268 from Rs 283 earlier.

“Sesa Sterlite offers leverage to our positive zinc and aluminium view. It should also gain from stronger zinc volume sequentially in second half (vs. first half) and the ramp-up of unproductive power and aluminium assets,” said the BofA note to clients.

“However, the weaker Cairn earnings outlook and coal cost pressure will dampen group profits, in our view. if oil stays at USD70/bbl, we estimate that there could be a further 11 percent downside to our FY16E EBITDA and 28 percent downside to our FY16e EPS (for Cairn),” the report said.

11:50 am Macro economy outlook: Inflation is likely to be in the 6-6.5 percent range in the first quarter of calendar year 2015, is the word coming in from Sonal Varma, India economist at Nomura Financial Advisory & Securities. However, disinflation continues to be there in the economy because of the lag effect of growth. She believes the Reserve Bank is taking a medium-term view on inflation and wants to see it at 4-4.5 percent. Her base case is still for a rate cut in January 2016.

According to her, there is limited scope for a interest rate cut in current framework. Varma says part of the bounceback in IIP in September is because of increased production on account of festive season in October. She expects to see some moderation in IIP growth in October as it had fewer working days.

9:35 am Coal e-auction: In a move to decide the fate of coal blocks that were de-allocated by the Supreme Court recently, the government on Monday proposed an ordinance to allow e-auction of mines to private players while adding that state-run companies would be allocated mines directly. The process would be completed in three-four months, finance minister Arun Jaitley said today, adding that proceeds of the auction would go directly to states where respective mines are located. However, in what would come as a disappointment to investors as well as key sectors related to coal mining, such as power, the government stopped short of allowing full commercial mining, with the FM stating that the ordinance would only feature an “enabling provision” to allow the same in future.

The decision by the government, which has been a logical progression in the wake of the Supreme Court to cancel coal licences to captive users, however, came as disappointing to experts tracking the sector as well as companies related to it.

The oil benchmark has fallen more than 12 percent from this year's peak of USD 115.71 reached in June due to the turmoil in Iraq. While the conflict there continues, there has been no significant disruption to oil supply from the No. 2 OPEC producer, giving space for a sustained retreat in prices.

11:30 am Buzzing: Shares of oil marketing companies are extending the spectacular rally seen yesterday as crude prices are still at 14-month low. HPCL, BPCL and IOC are up 3-4 percent each intraday on Tuesday. Goldman Sachs bullishness on the sector is also adding to the euphoria.

The brokerage sees almost no losses on diesel after September price hike and expects greatest upside for HPCL and BPCL with improving marketing margins. As losses on retail diesel sales are now down to Rs 0.8 per litre, Goldman Sachs estimates it to fall to Rs 0.3 per litre after the price hike on September assuming oil prices and diesel cracks remain around current levels.

“This implies we could effectively be done with the monthly cycle of diesel price increases in next two months and diesel will be market-priced,” it says in a report.

Bulls paused for a breather after a strong run for over the last four weeks, which pushed up indices 7.5 percent in anticipation of improving macro-environment and a stable government after the elections.

The 30-share BSE Sensex shed 109.99 points or 0.5 percent during the week to close at 21809.80 after hitting record high of 22023.98.

The 50-share NSE Nifty touched life high of 6562.85 before closing the week 6504.20, 22.45 points or 0.3 percent compared previous week’s closing.

Consistent fall in inflation during first two months of 2014 and an expansion in industrial output in January for the first time in four months supported the market. But concerns over fresh tensions in Crimea and a slowing Chinese economy limited upsides.

It was a consolidation week for the market after record highs and that may continue for some more time, experts feel. But most of them think the pre-election rally is not over yet and advise buying on every dip ahead of general elections.

KR Bharat, MD, Advent Advisors said the upward momentum was unlikely to fizzle out anytime soon, and the market could ignore economic realities in India and overseas and also the geopolitical realities, for a while.

According to him, the market has also discounted a stable government and is now in the process of discounting some of the likely policy initiatives as well.

In economic data, February CPI inflation slipped to 25-month low at 8.1 percent (from 8.79 percent in January), which is close to RBI’s comfort level of 8 percent. It has raised hopes that the RBI may not hike policy rates at its next meeting on April 1. WPI inflation softened to a nine-month low at 4.68 percent in February as against 5.05 percent in previous month supported by fall in vegetable prices.

January industrial output grew 0.1 percent compared to contraction of 0.2 percent in earlier month but consumer goods, capital goods and manufacturing remained in the negative domain.

BSE Healthcare, Metal and IT indices were hit hard, falling 1.7 percent, 4.82 percent and 6 percent, respectively.

However, the Capital Goods index gained the most, rising 3.5 percent followed by Bank, Realty, Oil & Gas and FMCG with 1-2 percent.

Infosys was the biggest loser, shedding 9 percent after chairman Narayana Murthy sounded caution on the company’s growth. The management in Barclays investor conference said that revenue growth for FY14 was likely to be at the lower end of its guidance (11.5-12 percent). Brokerage house Deutsche Bank cut target price on the stock to Rs 3,600 from Rs 3,800. This had a ripple effect on other IT majors like TCS and HCL Technologies, which fell 4-5 percent.

Metal shares weakened on poor Chinese trade data. Copper prices hit the lowest since July 2010 while iron ore prices touched more than 1.5-year lows during the week, which caused Sesa Sterlite, Hindalco Industries and Tata Steel to lose around 8 percent.

Ranbaxy Labs fell over 7 percent as Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to company on following a PIL that the company was selling adulterated cholesterol lowering drugs in the country. The company, which is already facing manufacturing quality concerns, has recalled more than 64,000 bottles of cholesterol lowering drug in the US.

Sun Pharma was the latest company in import alert list. It received import alert on its Karkhadi unit in Gujarat. The stock fell 5 percent though the company said the contribution of this unit to company’s revenue is negligible. In another blow, the drug maker recalled one batch of subsidiary’s Glumetza generic, according to sources.

Commercial vehicle maker Tata Motors slipped 4 percent on consistent worries over its domestic automotive business but Jaguar Land Rover continued to help its global business, with sales growing 14 percent in February.

Axis Bank declined over 3.5 percent. Divestment secretary on Friday said the government would raise Rs 3,000-4,000 crore via SUUTI stake sale in Axis Bank by March-end, reports CNBC-TV18 quoting Reuters.

However, engineering and construction major Larsen & Toubro climbed nearly 5 percent as the company received an order worth Rs 3,655 crore for mega-road project in Qatar.

Oil marketing company BPCL rallied over 6 percent on source-based reports that the government will reimburse under-recoveries next week.

Tata Power gained 5 percent after the Appellate Tribunal of Electricity (ATE) asked the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) and private power distribution companies in the city to lay out a roadmap for liquidation of “regulatory assets” worth up to Rs 8,000 crore.

Among others, IDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hero Motocorp, IndusInd Bank and Mahindra & Mahindra were up 4-8 percent.

The rally in banks was also after brokerage house Morgan Stanley upgraded financials to attractive from in-line with the raising ICICI Bank's target price to Rs 1,500 apiece from Rs 1,225 and HDFC Bank's target to Rs 1,000 from Rs 875.

In the corporate developments, sources said the government raised Rs 5,340 crore through stake sale in IOC today. ONGC and Oil India bought 5 percent stake each in IOC.

L&T Finance Holdings’ offer for sale issue fully subscribed, but was priced at a steep discount to market price. The company was also included in NSE F&O segment from Thursday.

Top car maker Maruti Suzuki has sent a clarification to market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) over the recent decision to have its parent Suzuki Motor Corporation set up a manufacturing plant in Gujarat, reports CNBC-TV18 quoting sources.

Late trade profit booking on Thursday drove the 50-share NSE Nifty below 6500-level for the first time in last five sessions. If Infosys had not seen a selling pressure the market may have seen positive close.

The Sensex fell 81.61 points to 21774.61 and the Nifty lost 23.80 points to 6493.10. Decliners beat advancers by a ratio of 1493 to 1276 on the BSE.

The market tried to hold positive momentum supported by banks, oil & gas and FMCG stocks despite heavy selling in Infosys and Sun Pharma, but sudden profit booking in last hour of trade in select banks, steel and Tata group stocks forced the market close lower.

Infosys was the biggest culprit in today’s trade, shedding 8.5 percent on revenue guidance concerns. The management suggested that revenue growth for FY14 will likely track at the lower end of its guidance (that is 11.5-12 percent).

Addressing an investor concall hosted by Barclays, Infosys executive chairman Narayana Murthy gave a rude shock to the entire analyst community when he said: “We expect to be somewhere between 11.5 percent and 12 percent in our revenue growth. Much more like 11.5 percent compared to what is being proclaimed as the Nasscom industry growth rate and that is about 13 percent.”

Barclays cut target price on the stock to Rs 3,960 apiece from Rs 4,150.

Sentiment effect was also seen in TCS and Wipro that lost 0.5-1 percent.

Sun Pharma was the second biggest loser in the Sensex after getting US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) import alert for Karkhadi unit in Gujarat. It was the first import alert for the company. The stock lost 5 percent.

PSU stocks like BEML, Hindustan Cooper, MMTC, Power Finance Corporation and STC India gained 5-10 percent.

Generic drugmaker Dr Reddy's Laboratories is recalling about 58,656 bottles of the heartburn drug lansoprazole in the United States due to a microbial contamination, the US Food and Drug Administration said.

It was classified as a ""Class II"" recall which indicates a remote chance of severe adverse consequences or death due to the product flaw.

While product recalls are not uncommon, the FDA announcement comes amid a string of quality problems for Indian drug makers.

In a weekly report, the US regulator also announced it was banning imports from Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Karkhadi manufacturing plant in the western state of Gujarat.

And just last week, the FDA disclosed that products made by Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy Laboratories were being recalled.

Dr. Reddy's voluntary recall of lansoprazole delayed release capsules, a generic version of Swiss drugmaker Novartis' drug Prevacid 24 HR, began on January 3, 2014, the FDA said on its website.

A spokesman for Dr Reddy's was not immediately available to comment."

1:30 pm: Macro outlook: The down tick seen in the consumer price index (CPI) number yesterday could be a one-off. In fact, the next few months could see headline CPI inflation moving higher, believes Sonal Varma, India Economist, Nomura Financial Advisory & Securities. She is expecting the number to inch back up to 8.5 percent. And there could be two factors responsible for that. One, the current adverse weather conditions in India like the unseasonal winter rains, hailstorms in certain part of India and the El Nino phenomena could again pose a risk to food inflation and vegetable prices may go up.

Two, the moderation seen in core CPI was mainly because of transport and communication segment and if one excludes that then the number was indeed higher said Varma. ""The underlying services segments of CPI still remains very sticky, some segments like medical, education which are relatively inelastic as compared to some of the other items like personal care which are more elastic to demand,"" she said.

Equity benchmarks saw consolidation for the third consecutive session Wednesday after seeing about 1000-point pre-election rally on the Sensex.

The 50-share NSE Nifty managed to hold the 6,500 level for the fourth day today, rising 5 points to 6516.90 while the 30-share BSE Sensex advanced 29.80 points to 21856.22.

03:50 pm European market check: A dizzying fall in copper to a near four-year low compounded increasing concern in China over its economic slowdown on Wednesday to send a wave of unease sweeping through world markets, reports Reuters.

World shares fell for fourth day, but it was copper, often seen as a proxy for China's fortunes, that grabbed the headlines as Shanghai futures fell by their 5 percent daily limit again and benchmark prices of the metal slumped to their lowest since 2010.

In Europe, bourses from London to Lisbon tumbled in early deals and safe-haven German government bonds were in demand as the jitters compounded the geopolitical tug-of-war between Russia and Kiev and the West over Crimea.

The low-cost airline is not reducing its effective revenue per seat kilometer. The inventory that is being put out for sale is highly controlled, he adds. Narayanan explains the routes that are in demand may not be on sale. These discounts are offered only on routes during non-peak hours to optimise the overall efficiency of the fleet. He jokes there is method in this madness afterall.

Yesterday, the IRDA had asked the insurer to refund Rs 275 crore, or 44 percent of the Rs 625 crore premium it had collected against issuing Dhanaraksha Plus Limited Premium Paying Term (LPPT) policy.

The regulator said that between the years 2008-09 and 2010-11, corporate agents mainly belonging to SBI and associate banks sold the policies to customers by charging the second year premium along with the first year’s, which resulted in commission payouts of 40 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively, for the two years.

11:50 am World news: China's central bank is prepared to take its strongest action since 2012 to loosen monetary policy if economic growth slows further, by cutting the amount of cash that banks must keep as reserves, sources involved in internal policy discussions say.

A cut would be triggered if growth slips below 7.5 percent and towards 7.0 percent, they said, and would come on top of money market operations and currency intervention via state banks that traders say has already loosened monetary conditions.

11:40 am Red Flag: Metals producer Sesa Sterlite said it may have to cut jobs if a top court sets a limit on the amount of iron ore it can mine in Goa when and if it allows mining to restart in what used to be the country's top exporter. Goa expects to resume mining before the monsoon that starts in June, its chief minister said last month.

A panel appointed by the Supreme Court is due to give its recommendation on the issue by March 15. A blanket ban on production and exports imposed in late 2012 to stop illegal mining, coupled with a similar step in neighbouring Karnataka, have cut India's exports of the ore by 85 percent, or 100 million tonnes, over the past two years.

Don't miss: Maruti falls 4%, domestic MFs raise red flag on Guj plant

The market is holding gains but investors seem to be a bit cautious ahead of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) and CPI inflation data to be released in the evening. The Sensex is up 80.04 points at 21906.46, and the Nifty is up 14.95 points at 6526.85. About 1152 shares have advanced, 974 shares declined, and 103 shares are unchanged.

The IIP data is expected to contract at around 1.1 percent compared to a contraction of 0.6 percent due to weakness in manufacturing data. Manufacturing comprises 80 percent of total IIP.

Economists will also keep an eye on the consumer durables in order to get a better picture of the demand scenario. Consumer durables number had contracted 16 percent for the month of December.

CPI inflation for February 2014 is expected to possibly cool down to 8.1 percent versus 8.8 percent on a month-on-month basis. In the last month it had already touched a two year low and is expected to ease off this month as well on the back of relief seen on the inflation front.

In the month of February food inflation dipped to single digits at around 9.9 percent and is expected to contract further. However, the core inflation had hardened to 8.1 percent as opposed to 8.05 percent on a month-on-month basis and that could be the key reason why the RBI would still be skeptical and may even hold rates according to economists.

The rupee is a bit lower tracking weakness in Asian equities. Gilts, too, are slightly down on profit sales after big gains in recent sessions.

10:10am FII View

Prabhat Awasthi, Nomura feels the banks are the key beneficiaries of the recalibration of market expectations regarding a favourable election outcome and benign inflation data.

According to him, the key feature of the market rally over the past week has been the outperformance by high-beta and domestic-cyclical sectors such as banks, real estate and capital goods that had been laggards since the beginning of 2013.

1:50 pm View on rupee: Analysts are growing increasingly bullish about the rupee in the near-term on the back of a sharply narrower current account deficit, easing inflation, and strong foreign investor inflows.

Barclays on Tuesday cut its one-month dollar/rupee (USD/INR) forecast to 59 from 61, with a stop loss at 62.50.

That would now place Barclays as the most optimistic among the 25 respondents to a Reuters poll which was released on Friday showing the median forecast at 62, wherein Barclays was still maintaining its forecast at 61.

Technically, USD/INR remains well below its 200-day moving average after first breaching that trend level on Thursday for the first time since May 2013, adding to the optimism on the rupee.

1:40 pm FII view: Although equity indices have crossed all time high levels, volatility index have risen indicating a bumpy ride ahead. But the rally, hope run for all, is not showing any sign of tiring out. In addition, the rupee has appreciated to 60.84 against the dollar, its highest level since August 6 of 2013. Till September 2013, the Indian rupee was the worst performing currency among the ‘fragile five’. For those who have missed the bus, all these factors could be a big temptation to jump on the bandwagon, says Manishi Raychaudhury of BNP Paribas.

Chaudhury said the over the longer term, the investing story of India is intact as valuations are reasonable. For the FIIs looking to invest regionally, India remains the safest country as macro-economic concerns have kept China and Korea out of bounds.

10:30am Gammon talks to CNBC-TV18

The finance ministry’s approval of Rangarajan Committee’s suggestion on rescheduling the premium payments for road projects, although a good step, may not mean significant change for those projects that were bidded aggressively by the construction companies or those that have been unviable says KK Mohanty, MD, Gammon Infrastructure in an interview to CNBC-TV18. “The premium rescheduling norms are too little too late”, he says.

According to him since the road sector is facing challenging times and is already in doldrums, most of the projects will go in for re-bidding even post new norms because out of 45 Projects awarded in 2011-13, only few have started work.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will now take up these projects on a case-by-case basis.

However, Gammon Infra can see additional cash flow for few more years if Vijayawada Eluru Gundugolanu project's premium is deferred, says Mohanty. The company pays a premium of Rs 57 crore per year for the project. The situation could get more clear post the new government coming in feels Mohanty.

After months of declining sales, the worst in the auto industry may be over and negative growth may be tapering off, believes Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director at Bajaj Auto.

02:30pm FII View on Ukraine

Rob Aspin of StandChart Bank is hopeful that leaders of both the West (US) and Europe will be able to negotiate and find a resolution for the Ukraine problems.

The house at present is underweight emerging market equities and Asian equities, and would rather focus more on US and European market at this juncture says Aspin.

However, with respect to India, he does see opportunities in the spaces like technology, healthcare and industrials although technology seems a bit richly valued at present. Among the financials they prefer the private banks over the public sector banks, says Aspin.

Answering a query on whether there could be outflows from emerging markets because the current geo political tensions, he said it depends on how the Ukrainian situations works out but if a resolution is found then the flows may return to European markets but they would take bit more time to return into Russia.

With regards to commodities like gold and crude rallying on back of the geo-political tensions, Aspin feels that it could be so because gold is a hedge for these tensions. He thinks if the tensions aggravate then it could provide support to gold prices but in case resolution is found then the prices could go back to normal.

2:00 Should Sebi intervene?Just as the dust was beginning to settle on the Fresenius Kabi delisting controversy, another MNC's action has reignited the debate on whether the delisting guidelines are being gamed by promoters looking for a cheap exit.

AstraZeneca Pharma today said that its board would be meeting on Wednesday to consider a proposal to delist the company. The foreign parent holds 75 percent in the company, having reduced stake from 90 percent in May last year through an offer for sale (OFS) to institutional investors at Rs 620 per share. AstraZeneca had taken the OFS route to comply with the Sebi rule mandating listed companies to maintain minimum 25 percent public shareholding.

To delist, the foreign parent now needs to buy an additional 15 percent from investors. Under current rules, promoters with less than 90 percent stake looking to delist, have to make an offer for minimum 50 percent of the outstanding equity and take their stake to 90 percent. For promoters holding 90 percent and above, the offer has to be for a minimum of 50 percent of the outstanding equity.

02:55pm NPA trouble to continue

The worst of the non-performing assets (NPA) trouble for banks is still ahead of us. That’s the word coming in from broking and research firm Credit Suisse. In its latest report, Credit Suisse says, the financial health of India Inc continues to deteriorate with companies having interest cover (IC) less than 1 at 37 percent in Q3, compared to 34 percent in Q2.

Moreover, it says that 82 percent of the debt was with companies that had IC less than 1 for at least four quarters in the past two years and 29 percent of them in the last eight consecutive quarters.

The interest coverage ratio (ICR) is used to determine how easily a company can pay interest expenses on outstanding debt. The ratio is calculated by dividing a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by the company's interest expenses for the same period.

The lower the ratio, the more the company is burdened by debt expense. When a company's interest coverage ratio is only 1.5 or lower, its ability to meet interest expenses may be questionable.

According to the Credit Suisse, the large corporate stress is yet to fully reflect in the economy.

While the average ticket size of restructuring referrals has moved up to Rs 2,200 crore (from Rs 700 crore in FY13), the impaired asset level for large corporate segment remains low at 5-6 percent vs more than 10 percent for the system.

However, he does not expect any massive redemption from FIIs. “We think asset quality pressure is likely to remain on the higher side,” he told CNBC-TV18’s Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy. Shah is long on private sector banks and underweight on PSU banks. For IT, he feels valuations are a bit high but not stretched.

Equity benchmarks lost more than a percent on Thursday but the Nifty managed to close tad above the psychological 6000-mark. Contraction in industrial output for the third straight month and fears of another rate hike caused selling pressure.

The Sensex plunged 255.14 points to 20,193.35, and the Nifty fell 82.90 points to 6,001.10 after hitting an intraday low of 5,991.10.

Though the market has fallen sharply reacting to negative industrial output and weakness in global peers, it has not broken the range yet; it is still in the broader range of 5900-6400, experts feel. In the last two-weeks, the Nifty has been gyrating in 6000-6100 levels.

Experts also feel the rate hike is unlikely in April but thereafter can’t be ruled out.

“Nifty ending the ongoing bounce around 6100-6150 is quite high. From this region the bears could make their presence felt and have another go at the 5950-6000 support zone. A close below this opens up another 5 percent on the downside,” Gautam Shah of JM Financial said.

Meanwhile, Nomura expects the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to stay on hold at the April policy meeting as CPI inflation in the next few months will likely pan out better than the RBI's projection.

However, from April onwards the brokerage house expects CPI inflation again to be higher than the RBI's expected trajectory leading to another 25 basis points hike in the repo rate to 8.25 percent by mid-2014.

CPI inflation eased to 8.8 percent in January from 9.9 percent in December due to lower vegetable prices. However, index of industrial production contracted by 0.6 percent in December as against a 1.3 percent decline in November, led by weaker growth in consumer durable and capital goods sector goods.

BSE Bank and Capital Goods indices were down over a 2 percent while Oil & Gas, Metal, Power, Healthcare and FMCG declined between 1-1.8 percent.

State-run ONGC tumbled over 3 percent ahead of its December quarter earnings due in evening today. According to CNBC-TV18 poll, analysts expect net profit to fall 5.2 percent to Rs 5,750 crore compared to a year-ago period.

Cipla was the biggest loser, falling nearly 8 percent after the company reported a 23 percent degrowth in net profit due to weak operational performance. Pharmaceutical major has attributed the steep drop in December quarter net profit to increased investment in R&D and a change in product mix.

State-owned coal producer Coal India's third quarter net profit slipped 11.4 percent at Rs 3,894 crore compared to a year-ago period, dented by lower e-auction price and higher cost. The stock plunged over 3 percent.

1:50 pm Boardroom: Underperformance in its diamond business weighed on the third-quarter margins of PC Jeweller, CFO Sanjeev Bhatia said in an interview, soon after the company reported its earnings.

“The company had witnessed higher profit in the second quarter due to the rupee depreciation,” Bhatia said, adding that the industry witnessed “turbulent times” in the third quarter.

Going forward, PC Jeweller would maintain its quantum of exports at current levels, he said. Supply of gold -- on which the government has slapped high duty in a bid to curb its imports -- has smoothened compared to a few quarters ago, according to the CFO.

The coastal state's economy has suffered since mining ban was imposed on it by the Supreme Court on account of largescale illegal activities. Parrikkar has often been accused by the Congress as being the ""kingpin"" behind closure of mining in Goa that rendered hundreds jobless.

1:30 pm Court order: Supreme Court directed that the ""status quo"" be maintained in the sale of United Spirits Ltd to British group Diageo Plc until April, when the court will hear the matter again.

In December, a regional Indian court ordered the annulment of the sale in response to a petition by creditors of United Breweries Holdings, which sold its stake in United Spirits to Diageo through a complicated share transaction.
