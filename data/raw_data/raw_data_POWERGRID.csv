State-owned Power Grid Corp board on November 22 approved a proposal to invest about Rs 367 crore in electricity transmission projects. Committee of Directors on Investment on Projects' of Powergrid in its meeting held on November 22, 2023, has accorded investment approval for two projects, a BSE filing showed.

As per the filing, the first project which got the approval is an augmentation of transformation capacity by 1X1500 MVA (3rd), 765/400 KV ICT at Maheshwaram (PG) substation in Telangana at an estimated cost of Rs 142.69 crore. It is scheduled to be commissioned within 21 months from the date of intimation by CTUIL (Central Transmission Utility) letter on July 10, 2023 — by April 9, 2025.

The board also approved the transmission System for Evacuation of Power from the Potential RE Zone in the Khavda Area of Gujarat under phase IV (7GW)- Part E4 at an estimated cost of Rs 224.41 crore, scheduled to be commissioned within 24 months from the date of intimation by CTUIL letter on July 10, 2023 — by July 9, 2025."

The construction of India’s ambitious Green Energy Corridor (GEC) for evacuation of 13 GW renewable energy from Ladakh will begin only in the calendar year 2026 due to extensive engineering studies required for the high-altitude mega transmission project, officials from the Powergrid Corporation of India (PGCIL) told Moneycontrol.

The project received its final approval from the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on October 18. The transmission line for evacuating green power from the under construction renewable energy park in Ladakh will start from Pang (Ladakh), and will pass through Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, after which it will end in Kaithal in Haryana, where it will be integrated with the national grid.

PGCIL is the implementing agency of the project, which will entail setting up of 713 km of transmission lines - including 480 kms of High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) lines and five GW capacity of HVDC terminals each at Pang (Ladakh) and Kaithal (Haryana).

The project is targeted to be set up by FY 2029-30, with a total estimated cost of Rs 20,773.70 crore, which includes a financial grant of Rs 8,309.48 crore by the central government. The remaining cost of Rs 12,464.22 crore will be borne by PGCIL.

The update on the project

Moneycontrol took stock of the project through PGCIL and found that the central public sector undertaking (CPSU) is yet to get formal communication from the central government on the modalities of how the financial grant would be given.

“Once we get the communication on the modalities of the grant from the central government, we will take it up for investment approval. But, we (PGCIL) have already started the studies of front-end engineering design for the marquee project,” said a senior official requesting anonymity.

PGCIL has appointed two HVDC players for one part of the two-part study. The first part, currently ongoing, is expected to be completed by March-April, which will provide the first report of this one-of-a-kind project. After that the CPSU will begin the second phase of the study, and only once both are complete, will it go for bidding of the project.

“So, work for the project will be awarded either in the last quarter of FY25 or the first quarter of FY26,” said another official, requesting anonymity.

Challenges - high terrain, sub-zero temperatures

According to PGCIL officials, this GEC-Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) will be one of the most challenging projects undertaken by it so far.

“This is why the studies have to be thorough. We are talking about laying long transmission lines in high altitudes of 4,700 metres above sea level with sub-zero temperatures. Tests have to be conducted on how every equipment that will be deployed by HVDC players will perform in such high altitude sub-zero climatic conditions,” said the official.

Besides, the working conditions there (Ladakh) will be conducive for hardly 5-6 months a year. “So, it will take at least five years from the time the work is awarded.”

The project is a major step toward India's target of achieving 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2030, besides contributing towards ensuring energy security for the country. It will also generate direct and indirect employment opportunities for both skilled and unskilled personnel in power and other related sectors, especially in the Ladakh region.

Queries sent to PGCIL for an official comment on the matter remained unanswered."

The government has given its approval to introduce market coupling in the electricity sector, which will result in uniform prices for power across multiple exchanges.

The Union Ministry of Power has written to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) asking it to initiate the process of market coupling across the country's power exchanges.

Under market coupling, buy and sell bids from all power exchanges in the country will be aggregated and matched to discover a uniform market clearing price (MCP). In the long-term, the measure is likely to also help in keeping power tariffs affordable in the country, apart from ensuring quick access.

""I am directed to say that several stakeholders have approached the Ministry of Power on the subject of market coupling in the context of multiple power exchanges. The Ministry of Power has decided to go ahead with the process with the approval of the Minister of Power and New and Renewable Energy. Therefore, the process for implementation of market needs to be initiated,"" read the letter sent by the Power Ministry to the CERC on June 2. Moneycontrol has a copy of the letter.

The CERC will now create a paper on the matter, which will be followed by stakeholder consultations.

At present, power prices or MCPs are different in the three power exchanges that India has - Indian Energy Exchange Limited (IEX), Power Exchange India Limited (PXIL) and Hindustan Power Exchange Limited (HPX).

The development is seen as a setback to IEX, which currently enjoys a monopoly status with a 90 percent share in the electricity market.

Following the development, shares of IEX tumbled more than 8 percent in the last 30 minutes of trade on June 8 as the news of market coupling spread. This is because once market coupling is implemented, it will ensure liquidity across all power bourses. At present,

IEX has significantly higher liquidity compared to PXIL and HPX because of which the latter two are less opted for.

The move is a step towards the government's intention to shift India's electricity trading from long-term (25 years) power purchase agreements (PPAs) to electricity markets (exchanges) and shorter PPAs of up to 12-15 years.

A senior Power Ministry official said that market coupling is also a step towards implementing the Market-Based Economic Dispatch (MBED) mechanism. The MBED mechanism envisages centralised scheduling for dispatching the entire yearly consumption of electricity of around 1,400 billion units.

It proposes centralized scheduling of power dispatches both at the inter-state and intra-state levels. Besides, market coupling will also pave the way for the implementation of electricity derivatives in the market.

Some states have objected to the MBED mechanism as they feel it will infringe on their autonomy over the electricity sector, which as per the Constitution is a concurrent subject.

CERC in February 2021 had issued the Power Market Regulations 2021, whose Part-5, Regulation 37 contains enabling regulations for the implementation of market coupling in power markets in India.

Prabhajit Sarkar, former managing director and CEO of PXIL said market coupling would require designating an agency as the Market Coupling Operator (MCO), which in all likelihood is going to be Grid-India. He said the entire process, including any market-wide consultation, should not take more than six months.

“The MCO will put in place all processes and formats such that power exchanges (PX) obtain bids/orders from clients in similar formats and pass them to the MCO with client-specific information masked, procedure for MCO to declare results and formats and procedures for inter-PX information exchange for scheduling of power and clearing and settlement of financial dues,” Sarkar said.

The MCO will also have to ensure that deposits and payment securities kept with any one exchange be granted fungibility, such that they can be used as collateral for placing bids/orders on any other exchange with due emphasis on superior risk management practices.

“The participants now no longer need to be beholden to only one exchange, which hitherto due to the market structure issue had the benefit of getting all the liquidity. With greater competition amongst exchanges and market platforms, the levels of service, access and most importantly cost of access in the form of transaction fees should come down making the market efficient. The true benefit of competition would finally be available to all market participants,” Sarkar said.

Naveen Singh, head, business development, HPX said the move is going to help reduce power tariffs in the long-run. ""We are confident that the CERC would soon come up with the necessary regulatory framework to ensure its implementation at the earliest. This will give a fillip to the service levels in the power market, ensure better transparency and uniform price discovery across exchanges. It is also expected to bring down the power tariff in the country significantly,"" he said.

IEX and PXIL did not comment on the matter."

Decent growth in electricity consumption and generation along with increased capacity are likely to be reflected in the Q4 earnings of Indian power companies.

“Demand is likely to surge in the next six-seven months, with the onset of summers and good prospects for manufacturing growth,” Elara said.

The brokerage likes power companies because regulatory support for utilities that own renewable energy capacity and storage is very constructive across India, which provides a multi-year path for growth.

Electricity demand in the country is expected to touch about 230 gigawatts, an all-time record, this summer. The government has said sufficient coal stocks and gas capacities have been tied up and there won’t be any issues during peak power demand.

India’s power consumption grew by 7 percent YoY in Q4 of FY23, supported by strong growth of 13 percent/9 percent in the first two months, which offsets the 1 percent YoY decline in March 2023, said Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

“We expect PSU power companies like NTPC/Power Grid to post decent adjusted PAT growth of 5 percent/9 percent YoY during the quarter,” it said.

Growth in NTPC, the country’s largest electricity generator, would be driven by expansion of power generation and commercialisation of new capacities, the brokerage said. Modest asset capitalisation would drive Power Grid’s earnings growth, the brokerage firm said.

Elara Securities expects Power Grid Corporation of India, the largest transmission utility, to post higher growth on increased capacity.

Sharekhan expects Tata Power to report strong earnings growth on a YoY basis due to a low base last year, although sequentially, net profit would decline due to losses at its 4,000 MW Mundra plant, which was operational for a few days in the March quarter, and moderation in coal realisation.

Analysts pointed out that better contribution from the renewable segment will support the Tata Group company’s earnings. Tata Power has a generation capacity of 14,076 MW of which 37 percent comes from clean energy sources.

“We expect higher losses from Mundra, as the plant was barely operational during 4QFY23,” Kotak Institutional Equities said about Tata Power. “Coal mining profits to moderate sequentially due to softness in realisations.”

However, the brokerage firm expects earnings from the renewable portfolio benefiting from a higher capacity base and strong execution at Tata Power Solar.

The market will monitor the NTPC management’s commentary on commercial capacity addition and the timeline for the monetisation of stake in the renewable asset subsidiary. The company’s installed capacity, including that of joint ventures and subsidiaries, is 71,644 MW.

Power Grid’s focus on new business avenues such as smart metering and capital expenditure guidance would also be tracked, according to analysts.

Global brokerage firm Jefferies believes power to be a multi-year story but 2023 could witness a pause. With the expectation of a peak power demand this summer season, Jefferies sees three companies-NTPC, JSW Energy, and Indian Energy Exchange (IEX)-as beneficiaries of the peak demand.

Jefferies has recommended ‘buying’ shares of NTPC and JSW Energy, whereas it has given an ’underperform’ rating to IEX.

Central Electricity Authority anticipates a 4-5 percent YoY rise in April-May 2023 power demand. Jefferies pointed out that 85 percent of India’s residential demand is driven by durables such as air-conditioners, and coolers, among others, and soaring summer temperatures in 2022 led to shortages, which the Ministry is preparing for in advance.

Domestic coal stocks are at 11 days, above the normal level of 9 days. Coal plants have been directed to take up maintenance in advance and imported coal plants should run at full capacity after March 16, the brokerage firm said. It believes proactive measures will see majority of peak summer demand being met till normalising from monsoon July onwards.

NTPC’s expensive gas plants have been given a go ahead for utilisation ramp up if power demand is higher, which could lead to NTPC seeing 3-5 percent Earnings Per Share (EPS) accretion for FY24 as it earns incentive on higher plant utilisation levels, Jefferies said.

For JSW Energy, the brokerage firm said the energy company has 13 percent capacity available for merchant, which is entirely based on imported coal. Merchant power prices are currently at Rs 6 per unit. “Every 5 percent change in this price could add 5-8 percent to FY24 EPS,” Jefferies said.

With respect to IEX, Jefferies expects higher exchange volumes to be a positive for the company. January-February 2023 have been weak volume months for IEX at a 3 percent YoY decline but March till date saw a 13 percent YoY dip.

“Our 4QFY23 estimates factor flat YoY volume growth, which needs volumes to rise 16 percent YoY in the second half of March. Every 5 percent rise in volumes could add 5 percent to FY24 EPS,” it said.

Shares of NTPC and IEX were flat, while those of JSW Energy were trading about one percent higher on the BSE.

However, the pause in power story is likely because of a couple of reasons. Firstly, Solar Energy Corp of India (SECI) awards have slowed to just 4.6 GW in first nine months of FY23 with another 4-5 GW planned by March 2023 against the planned 15 GW.

Secondly, State Electricity Boards are not giving demand requirements to SECI as they are uncertain about the growth outlook post the next 24-36 months. Game-changing distribution reform seems to be on the back-burner for now till the May 2024 elections, the brokerage firm said.

Jefferies believes power Transmission & Distribution (T&D) spend, which has lagged generation, will pick up in 2023 which has prompted the brokerage firm to be positive on Power Grid Corporation of India with a ‘buy’ call. It has also hiked its FY23-25 EPS for Tata Power by 1-8 percent given better coal realisation, but marginally cut its target price on the stock to Rs 175 from Rs 180 due to higher discounting rate for coal DCF, but has retained its ‘underperform’ rating as power business is unlikely to surprise on our growth expectations.

Shares of Tata Power and Power Grid were down 0.2 and 1.9 percent respectively, on the BSE."
"March 13, 2023 05:57 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jm-financial-sees-an-action-packed-utilities-space-bullish-on-ntpc-power-grid-10242291.html,"JM Financial Institutional Securities believes 2023 will witness a lot of action in the utilities space with various government initiatives for renewable energy, which will have a material impact on the performance of Indian utilities. The brokerage firm is bullish on NTPC and Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL).

With the outlook for the sector turning bright, power utility stocks have caught the fancy of investors and many believe these to be a good buy at this juncture. Investors are optimistic that peak power demand will keep consumption higher throughout summer.

After interacting with NTPC, PGCIL, and NTPC Green Energy, the brokerage firm believes that the current momentum in thermal capital expenditure (capex) can be construed as a course correction rather than as a secular trend of healthy capex in thermal power.

The brokerage firm noted that on the transmission infrastructure front, capacity addition has been modest in recent years, and any traction in investment in state-level transmission infrastructure, which is the next growth engine, can be very positive for the industry.

Additionally, the pace of solar capacity addition will pick up in future given the various policy initiatives, the brokerage firm added.

JM Financial Institutional Securities has maintained its ‘buy’ call on NTPC with a target price of Rs 205, as it remains best placed for success in India’s energy transition and is poised for leadership in the country’s solar market.

The visible pipeline of projects, lower cost of debt, benefit of scale, likely modest revival in thermal capex on the back of high power demand, and immunity from the vagaries of coal price and availability are the reasons behind the brokerage firm’s bullishness.

Shares of NTPC settled at Rs 179.65, down 0.6 percent, while those of PGCIL ended down 0.2 percent at Rs 226.10.

It has also retained its ‘buy’ recommendation on PGCIL with a target price of Rs 255, as it sees the company’s annual capex rising to Rs 12,000-13,000 crore by FY24-25, compared to Rs 8,800 crore in FY22-23 <added, please see>. The company also has a robust order book which includes, among others, a transmission (added, please see) project in Leh (Rs 20,700 crore), and an expected pipeline of Rs 40,000-50,000 crore through tariff-based competitive bidding over the next 12 months. and smart metering capex of Rs 5500–6000 crore.

Additionally, the company faces no headwinds from ESG or renewables given that all power, regardless of source of generation, has to be transmitted, the brokerage explained.

Even ICRA had said that sustained growth in electricity demand is expected to improve visibility on the signing of new Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) for thermal Independent Power Producers (IPP).

“This is a positive for thermal IPPs, as lack of PPAs has remained one of the major concerns, leading to large stressed capacity in the thermal power sector,” the ratings agency had said."
"March 13, 2023 05:53 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/power-stocks-hot-picks-for-investors-right-now-10223851.html,"Power utility stocks have caught the fancy of investors and many believe these to be a good buy at this juncture, with the outlook for the sector turning bright.

Power demand in India grew 10 percent year-on-year (YoY) in the first nine months of FY23, with a peak demand of 206 GW, up 12 percent YoY in December 2022.

Power demand and consumption in India are said to grow by 12-13 percent during peak periods, while the nation’s power generation has grown by 9.56 percent during the April 2022-February 2023 period. So, understandably the public sector-owned power plants are ordered by the government to operate at full capacity as demand or consumption increase has outpaced power generation growth significantly.

NTPC’s power generation has grown faster than the country's at 11.92 percent between April-February, Anmol Das, Head of Research, Teji Mandi-subsidiary of Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Riding the summer wave

“Power utility companies are expected to report double-digit growth for the March quarter as IMD predictions of heat waves across northern, central and eastern India will force usage of more electricity, while industrial usage is already at new peaks,” Das said. Even as industrial usage will peak in March, heat waves will keep retail consumption high throughout the summer, he added.

Double-digit growth in power demand is on a high base and the government’s measures to ensure efficient planning of supply are big positives for the sector, said Prasanna Bidkar, a smallcase manager and investment specialist at Rupeeting, an investment management company with long-term investing strategies.

While NTPC has been directed to operate gas-based plants at full capacity, the key problem is their inability to secure fuel. Because of this, out of the 25 GW gas-based capacity in India, more than half ― almost 14 GW ― is not even operational, Bidkar said. However, along with invoking Section 11 of the Electricity Act, 2003, gas supply has also been arranged for NTPC, reflecting the improvement in system planning, and ensuring a practical way of meeting demand, he added.

“Moreover, the ‘turn-on-turn-off’ time being much faster for gas-based power plants, compared to coal-based plants would result in better PLF (plant load factor), and drive an increase in incentive income,” he said. Further, the High Price Day Ahead Market (HP-DAM) has been approved, which will facilitate a selling price as high as Rs 50 per unit, thereby providing relief to generation companies running their plants on natural gas that is costlier, Bidkar said.

Overall, both demand and supply mechanisms fitting in well will ensure no mass power cuts, which will bode well for power utility stocks.

Investment plays

The consistent double-digit growth in power demand and policy actions from the government to avoid any power outages during summer, such as invoking Section 11 of the Electricity Act, 2003, bode well for all utilities with significant improvement in the utilisation (PLF) of thermal power plants, rise in merchant power rates, expeditious execution of power projects (both thermal and renewables), strong focus on energy storage projects in the medium term, and attempts to bring life back into thermal capex, said JM Financial Institutional Securities in its report.

It believes, “The regulated business model of power utilities offers a safe haven amidst the uncertain and volatile environment assuring visibility and stability in earnings. We maintain our positive view on power utilities given steady growth, long-term revenue visibility, and a favourable power demand scenario.”

The sector is growing at a healthy pace in India, with renewables like solar and wind capacities growing in the mid-teens. NTPC has already crossed more than 3 GW of renewable capacity, and has a rich pipeline of upcoming renewable capacity to be added in its portfolio. “Over time, the stock may also be considered higher in the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) framework by foreign funds, while it maintains a high dividend yield of 4 percent. This could be seen worth investing with a long-term view and moderate gains at current valuations,” said Das.

With an upward revision in the outlook for thermal power, along with a reduction in dues from state distribution utilities or discoms, the view on these companies has definitely turned positive, said Bidkar. “Other than the several tailwinds, in current market conditions, we are anyway focussing on companies with a strong asset base. And from that perspective, utilities as a sector certainly becomes worth investing in right now.”

He added, “We like companies which are scaling up capacities to meet growing demand, and operate on a cost plus revenue model, earning the assured ROE (Return On Equity) spread. In this context, we like NHPC, NTPC, and Power Grid.”

In the power sector, JM Financial Institutional Securities believes NTPC and Power Grid Corporation of India are the most stable in terms of returns with more than 90 percent of earnings coming from the regulated model assuring fixed and stable returns.

CESC has long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for 95 percent of its 2.3 GW generation capacity, along with its distribution licence and franchise business.

Tata Power, Torrent Power and JSW Energy also have long-term PPA tie-ups for their generation capacities, ensuring stable returns that are fuelling their transition to renewables. But the brokerage firm believes that NTPC enjoys a relative advantage over its peers due to access to debt at a lower cost facilitating its renewables portfolio, likely modest revival in thermal capex on the back of high power demand, and immunity from the vagaries of coal price and availability.

NTPC is loved by analysts and currently boasts of 25 ""buy"" calls, one hold and zero sell calls. Its optimism score is 96.

Meanwhile, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas believes the outlook remains strong, given the expectation of sustained double-digit growth in power demand during summers. This bodes well for higher PLF for thermal power plants and would benefit NTPC.

“We highlight here that NTPC’s thermal PLF of 74.5 percent in the 9MFY23 was much higher than the national average of 63 percent and would further improve NTPC’s thermal PLF over Q4FY23- Q1FY24, given high power demand (peak demand estimate of 229 GW in April 2023),” it said.

With improved coal stocks at thermal power plants, Plant Availability Factor (PAF) has improved, and, thus, it expects fixed cost under-recoveries to decline for power companies. Moreover, the government’s power sector package of over Rs 3 lakh crore in the Budget would help power discoms clear dues of generation and transmission companies which would, in turn, reduce the power sector’s receivables and strengthen companies’ balance sheets, it said."

Power Grid has been in the limelight lately given the influx of news and because of its recent order wins. Last week, the company was declared as the successful bidder under a Tariff Based Competitive Bidding for a project in Gujarat to establish Inter-State Transmission System.

In February-end, Power Grid’s board approved investing over Rs 803 crore for various electricity transmission projects in India, which could lead to higher revenue for the company.

The company was listed in 2007, and has three business segments – Transmission, Telecom and Consultancy, with transmission segment being the main focus of the business.

As the transmission industry is expected to continue growing, Power Grid is poised to capitalise on its strong pipeline of projects and continued capital expenditure in solar power generation and distribution infrastructure, said Geojit Research. However, in the near-term, the brokerage firm remains cautious on input price volatility and expects profitability to be impacted.

The stock has rallied from Rs 208 in early January to Rs 226.

India has provided some $4 billion in assistance to its southern neighbour since the crisis hit early last year, but Sri Lanka is now seeking to enhance trade and investments as it moves to close a $2.9 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, the country's envoy to New Delhi told Reuters.

""We have to have growth, otherwise basically the economy will shrink,"" Milinda Moragoda said.

""As far as growth is concerned, India offers that prospect. So we will have to move on that. Tourism from India, investment from India, integration with India. That's what we have to do.""

A key part of Sri Lanka's economic recovery plan rests on developing its renewable energy resources in the island's north, from where power can be transported into southern India through a cross-border transmission cable.

The two countries resumed talks on linking their electricity grids last year, and Moragoda said a memorandum of understanding on the project would be signed within two months, which will be followed by a feasibility study.

First proposed more than a decade ago, the project has made little progress so far. But Moragoda said Sri Lanka hoped to get the transmission line in place within two to three years so that renewable power produced on the island can be sold to India.

""We need to have more sources of foreign exchange and electricity will be ideal,"" he said.

The neighbours will also start negotiations within weeks on enhancing an existing free trade agreement, Moragoda said, as part of a push by Sri Lanka to seal deals with key trading partners, including China and Thailand.

""On our side, we are just about to nominate the (negotiations) team,"" he said, adding that the focus would be on enhancing trade in sectors including textiles and garments, a major foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka.

This development comes in the wake of series of resignations by the company's directors. Sushama Nath, Preeti Saran, Jayant Purushottam Gokhale and Subhash S Mundra resigned as independent directors from the board on December 5, citing corporate governance issues.

In January this year, three directors also walked out from the board of PTC Financial Services (PFS), a subsidiary of PTC India, flagging same concerns.

Shares of Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (Power Grid) climbed over 3 percent on Tuesday after a news report said that the government has rejected REC's proposal to sell Power Finance Corporation's (PFC) stake to Power Grid.

There were reports stating REC had asked the government to consider selling PFC’s stake in the company to Power Grid.

“The government has rejected power financier REC Ltd's proposal of its takeover by Power Grid Corp of India (PGCIL),” a September 26 report in the Economic Times said, citing power and new and renewable energy minister RK Singh.

Power Grid's market capitalisation had fallen about Rs 33,000 crore in the last two trading sessions following reports of the proposal, the report said.

Foreign brokerage firm Citi believes that a big overhang is removed with the rejection of proposal by the power ministry. The brokerage firm has a ‘buy’ call on Power Grid shares due to safe and stable business model, high return on equity and high market share.

Citi has a target price of Rs 270 on the stock price. At 9:50am, the stock was up 0.5 percent at Rs 202.2 on the BSE. The scrip has risen today after seven days of consecutive losses.

“It might be good for Power Grid as it is in the business of transmitting the power and it doesn’t have any experience in financing projects. It was an unrelated diversification for Power Grid and it might not be able to provide any expertise in this segment apart from that it would also impact power Grid’s main business,” ICICI Direct Research said.

Media reports indicate that Power Ministry is in talks with Power Grid to purchase PFC’s 52.63 percent stake (Rs 144 billion) in REC, Jefferies said in a research report.

Jefferies pointed out that Power Grid has sufficient cash and it remains positive on the one year and medium-term transmission spend growth story. ""But, this is a near-term dampener and could negatively impact FY23E-25E EPS by 3-5%. Dividend yield could also be lower at 4% vs 6% in FY23E,"" the global brokerage firm cautioned.

Power Grid transmits about 50 percent of the total power generated in India on its transmission network. It also undertakes transmission related consultancy to more than 150 domestic clients and owns and operates 71,673 km of telecom network.

Ukraine accused Russian forces of attacking civilian infrastructure in response to a rapid weekend offensive by Ukrainian troops that drove Russia to abandon its main bastion in the Kharkiv region.

Ukrainian officials said the targets of the retaliatory attacks included water facilities and a thermal power station in Kharkiv, and that they caused widespread blackouts.

""No military facilities, the goal is to deprive people of light & heat,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter late on Sunday.

The U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, also denounced the strikes.

""Russia's apparent response to Ukraine liberating cities and villages in the east: sending missiles to attempt to destroy critical civilian infrastructure,"" Brink tweeted.

Moscow denies its forces deliberately target civilians.

Zelenskiy has described Ukraine's offensive in the northeast as a potential breakthrough in the six-month-old war, and said the winter could see further territorial gains if Kyiv received more powerful weapons.

In the worst defeat for Moscow's forces since they were repelled from the outskirts of the capital Kyiv in March, thousands of Russian soldiers left behind ammunition and equipment as they fled the city of Izium, which they had used as a logistics hub.

Ukraine's chief commander, General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said the armed forces had regained control of more than 3,000 square km (1,158 square miles) since the start of this month.

Moscow's almost total silence on the defeat - or any explanation for what had taken place in northeastern Ukraine - provoked significant anger among some pro-war commentators and Russian nationalists on social media. Some called on Sunday for President Vladimir Putin to make immediate changes to ensure ultimate victory in the war.

'CYNICAL REVENGE'

Zelenskiy said late on Sunday that Russian attacks caused a total blackout in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, and partial blackouts in the Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy regions.

""They are unable to reconcile themselves to defeats on the battlefield,"" Dnipropetrovsk Governor Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram.

Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president's office, posted an image on Telegram of electrical infrastructure on fire but added power had been restored in some regions.

Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov described Sunday's attacks as ""cynical revenge"" for the success of Ukrainian troops at the front, particularly in Kharkiv.

Ukraine's gains are important politically for Zelenskiy as he seeks to keep Europe united behind Ukraine - supplying weapons and money - even as an energy crisis looms this winter following cuts in Russian gas supplies to European customers.

Zelenskiy said Ukrainian forces would continue to advance.

""We will not be standing still,"" he said in a CNN interview recorded on Friday in Kyiv. ""We will be slowly, gradually moving forward.""

'SNOWBALL ROLLING DOWN A HILL'

Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Ukraine needed to secure retaken territory against a possible Russian counterattack on stretched Ukrainian supply lines. He told the Financial Times that Ukrainian forces could be encircled by fresh Russian troops if they advanced too far.

But he said the offensive had gone far better than expected, describing it as a ""snowball rolling down a hill"".

""It's a sign that Russia can be defeated,"" he said.

Kyiv-based military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said the gains could bring a further push into Luhansk region, whose capture Russia claimed at the beginning of July.

""If you look at the map, it is logical to assume that the offensive will develop in the direction of Svatove - Starobelsk, and Sievierodonetsk - Lysychansk,"" he said.

The head of Russia's administration in Kharkiv told residents to evacuate the province and flee to Russia, TASS reported on Saturday. Witnesses described traffic jams with people leaving Russian-held territory.

Leonid Pasechnik, the head of the Luhansk People's Republic, was quoted by Russian news agencies saying that Ukrainian forces were attempting to penetrate that region, which has been held by Russian forces since July.

""Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups have not stopped their attempts to infiltrate the territory of the republic for the purpose of provocation and intimidating our citizens,"" he said, adding that there had been ""no retreat from positions held by the republic.""

Washington appeared to take a cautious public posture, with the Pentagon referring Reuters to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's remarks on Thursday about Kyiv's ""encouraging"" battlefield successes.

Britain's defence ministry said on Sunday that fighting continued around Izium and the city of Kupiansk, the sole rail hub supplying Russia's front line across northeastern Ukraine, which has been retaken by Ukraine's forces.

NUCLEAR REACTOR SHUTS DOWN

As the war entered its 200th day, Ukraine on Sunday shut down the last operating reactor at Europe's biggest nuclear power plant to guard against a catastrophe as fighting rages nearby.

Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling around the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia plant, risking a release of radiation.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said a backup power line to the plant had been restored, providing the external electricity it needed to carry out the shutdown while defending against the risk of a meltdown.

French President Emmanuel Macron told Putin in a phone call on Sunday that the plant's occupation by Russian troops is the reason why its security is compromised, the French presidency said. Putin blamed Ukrainian forces, according to a Kremlin statement."

State-run Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) is pushing dated technology for connecting smart electricity meters, potentially saddling users with old technology and jeopardising an important reform dear to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

PGCIL, the central transmission utility, has floated a smart metering tender—the largest such yet—but what they’ve done is specified that it has to be based on obsolete tech, namely 2G and RF mesh.

People familiar with the matter said that modern options have been given short shrift in favour of older technology, with some officials of PGCIL arguing that contemporary technology is unproven. But that will not hold water because Tata Power Delhi Distribution, which supplies electricity in the north and north-west Delhi, last year chose the latest platform and connectivity technology-- Narrow Band Internet of Things (NBIoT). This technology can work with 4G and 5G networks.

Auctions for the 5G spectrum concluded recently, and India is poised for the launch of ultra-high-speed cellular data services by around October.

Electricity sector reform is an important initiative that is being personally championed by the prime minister, and smart meters are a vital component of power sector reform. If smart metering technology falls prey to myopic decision-making, it could send wrong signals about the power ministry’s commitment to choosing the best alternatives, those aware of discussions around this issue told Moneycontrol.

PGCIL has tweaked the technology criteria in the tender inviting bids for setting up one crore smart meters just days before the bid closes on August 30, industry sources said.

The Ministry of Power launched a new program –Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) which, among other reforms for the beleaguered power distribution sector, aims to roll out smart meters to 250 million customers by 2025.

In March, PGCIL invited bids for the smart meters based on second generation (2G) and RF mesh frequency.

A senior industry official who is closely following the tender said in June that PGCIL appeared to see sense and modified the tender to include NBIoT technology. But there was another revision in the bid criterion on August 18, excluding this technology. The decision to exclude NBIoT was released only on August 22, a week ahead of the last date of bids on August 30.

PGCIL officials could not be reached for comments.

A smart meter collects and tracks the electricity consumption of a unit or a system that it is attached to. Unlike the regular meter, a smart meter sends the data to the power distributor faster and in some instances in real-time, which makes it easier for the supplier to manage the power supply and avoid leakages in the system.

As India executes the world’s largest electricity smart metering programme aimed at reducing electricity distribution losses, the industry is looking at new and cost-effective solutions."

Indians are cranking up air conditioning as they still work from home, while lights come back on in offices and factories with an end to COVID curbs, upending power demand patterns amid a heatwave and the country's worst blackouts in years.

India has traditionally seen peak demand late in the evening when people head back home but that has shifted to mid-afternoon when temperatures are hottest, government data shows, driven by record residential daytime use, a pick up in industrial work, and more use of irrigation pumps to tap higher solar supply.

Also Read: Explainer-Why is India facing its worst power crisis in over six years?

Relentless daytime demand in the world's third-biggest power market means utilities have been unable to ease output even over peak solar power supply periods, further straining grids already overwhelmed due to the heatwave baking swathes of South Asia.

For power producers in India, this has led to a larger-than-usual drawdown in coal inventories, leaving them under-stocked ahead of the hottest part of the year, with disruptions to coal supply lines due to rail car shortages adding to their woes.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

The power crunch in India highlights potential challenges for other nations in the region such as Pakistan and Bangladesh with even smaller generation capacities.

Pakistan too has been facing severe outages with some rural areas getting as few as six hours of electricity per day.

""While the culture of work from home has gained more social acceptance, offices have also opened up across India, which has led to a combination of both higher domestic and commercial demand,"" said Prabhajit Kumar Sarkar, Managing Director and CEO at Power Exchange India Limited.

A senior official from the federal grid operator POSOCO agreed. ""The hybrid work culture is definitely causing a major power demand peak in the afternoon,"" he said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to media.

A hybrid work model, where people work some days in office and others remotely, is a popular choice among companies as they emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.

















Industry experts say the Indian government could consider steps such as variable tariffs to disincentivise daytime usage to ease the power crunch.

""Regulators could consider flattening the curve by incentivising power consumption during non-peak hours by reducing tariffs,"" said R.K. Verma, former chairman of India's Central Electricity Authority.

Hiking tariffs for peak hours is another option, he added.

The federal power ministry did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment on this.

Analysts and experts cautioned that grids would remain under pressure for years, with midday peak demand adding to persistent high use during the night when solar power supplies drop off.

RELENTLESS POWER DEMAND

India's total power output in the first four months of 2022 rose by an average of 6.1 percent from a year earlier and by 24.3 percent from the COVID-hit levels of 2020, POSOCO data shows.

In April, as the heatwave kicked in, average power production spiked 11.9 percent versus 2021 and 56.8 percent from 2020.

Average power use over 1445-1530 hours in the afternoon surged 15.5 percent from a year ago, versus an 11.5 percent rise for the full month, POSOCO data shows.

On April 29, when India saw some of its worst blackouts in years, its electricity supply rose to 207.1 gigawatts (GW) in the afternoon, the highest since July 2021. But that still fell 4.7 percent short of demand, causing grid breakdowns.

There was no let up in power demand at night either, with supply averaging 180.3 GW over 2245-2300 hours in April, 8.5 percent more than a year ago, on heavy air-conditioner use.

""There is a definite likelihood of continued power cuts due to the current heat conditions,"" said Rajiv Agarwal, secretary general of the Indian Captive Power Producers Association.

India's electricity demand this year is expected to rise at the fastest pace in at least 38 years, officials say.

















RISK OF MORE GRID BREAKDOWNS

Such sustained demand rates have taken a toll on coal stocks at power plants, which have fallen to just enough for 8 days of use - the lowest in at least nine years for this time of the year - and 42 percent below India's target at end-April.

India's worst power crisis in over six years is partly attributable to the shortage of coal, which accounts for more than 75 percent of its electricity generation since 2015 on an average.

Amid a push for cleaner air, expansion of coal-fired plants has lagged, registering less than an 18 percent gain since 2015 and a mere 4 percent expansion in the past five years, data from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy shows.

This compares to a near doubling in renewable sources in the past five years.















With the South Asian heatwave still raging, and temperatures set to stay elevated through the summer, low coal stockpiles remain a worry for utilities and the government.

New Delhi has already unveiled steps to alleviate the power crunch, including cancelling passenger train services to free up tracks for the movement of coal and invoking an emergency law to restart generation at idled import-dependent coal power plants.

But it may be years before India can break free from the risk of further grid breakdowns, industry analysts say.

""We need to focus on adding generation capacities which can supply during night hours, like nuclear, hydro or coal, which may take at least 3-5 years to come onstream,"" said Victor Vanya, director at power analytics firm EMA Solutions."

Business enquiries have gone up recently, indicating that private sector customers are back to spending, Sanjeev Sharma, country head and managing director of ABB India Ltd, tells Moneycontrol’s Rachita Prasad in an exclusive interview.

Sharma said that the company is bullish on food and beverage, pharma, data centre, power distribution, automotive, building and infrastructure segments in India.

The company will continue with organic growth but has set its eyes on acquisitions, too, for different businesses, he said.

Edited excerpts:

ABB’s global CEO has said that the global supply chain continues to be an issue, or else order execution would have been faster and revenue booking could have been at a higher pace. How much of the disruption in the global supply chain is still impacting ABB India?

All our 18 business divisions are very local in nature. We have localised our value chain as much as possible. So the impact of disruptions in the global supply chain has been less. But then there are critical areas where we have to import as the local supply chains are not so developed. Our local business and global supply chain did a good job in handling whatever demand projections we had.

The robustness in demand surprised us. For the extra demand that came, we had to take extra efforts with materials and components to serve customers.

The supply-chain disruption has impacted availability and has led to price escalation. How are you managing that?

Availability of semiconductors and plastics has been hit. These are critical components. Not all our products use semiconductors, unlike some other industries. We are a 130-year-old company and have flexibility in production of different products that use different chips. There were a number of strategies we could use. But I have to admit there was a crunch of semiconductors which continues. Our team detected the plastic supply crunch pretty early and organised themselves well.

We are a company with a long-term view. So, whatever we had on our books and the delivery time we had committed, we had to deliver that and we did. Wherever the supply contract allowed, we changed the price. But when we started booking new orders and the cost and inflation was visible, we passed it on to the customers.

Almost 70 percent of our business is products which have a two-and-a-half month cycle. That means, earlier orders are already delivered. Of the rest, 20 percent is service, which is billed on the basis of usage, and 10 percent is projects where large contracts have been executed. What we have now are fresh projects.

ABB sold a majority stake in the power grid projects business globally, and ABB India’s business mix has undergone a lot of changes. You are now a products company. What is the strategy here and what’s the way ahead?

In the last few years, the main reason why we have very strong cash flows, conversion of profits, balance sheet and cash position is the product portfolio. The conversion cycle of orders to revenue is short and cash flow is good. We had to let go of our power grid business at a global level, and we followed in India by going with Hitachi, which is now Hitachi Energy.

We also hived off our solar inverter business to Fimer. So our footprint now is less towards utilities and more towards industrial work. We have the solutions for power distribution in cities, energy efficiency, robotics automation portfolio and process automation. We are mostly directed in this space for projects. We expect the projects portfolio to increase, going forward. The Indian economy has seen low capex in the core sector in the last many years. But now when capex recovery will happen, it will translate into projects.

We have 18 divisions catering to 20 market segments. They will grow in rotation. Some will be strong today and some others will grow stronger tomorrow and that will provide robustness to our portfolio.

Segments like food and beverage, pharma, data centre, power distribution, automotive, building and infrastructure are growing over 10 percent. Some other segments -- like coal, cement, oil and gas, chemical, metals and mining, pulp and paper, plastic and textiles -- are growing below 10 percent.

Now there is a clear visibility of capex formation in the latter category and they will also grow above the 10 percent level.

In the current environment, many of your peers are aligning their businesses to segments which derive jobs from the government capex as private sector capex has been low. Are you pinning hopes too much on the private sector capex revival?

I didn’t say that. Our exposure to government- and private-sector capex is equal. We will benefit from both. We will not take direct engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) orders from the government due to the portfolio’s construct. There will be EPC contractors who will take government orders and buy products and solutions from us.

What is your assessment of private sector sentiment on the ground? Are there greenshoots in private sector capex?

On the macro side, we have a government which has a fairly robust and positive policy towards capex formation and all incentives are in place. The non-performing assets in the banking sector are somehow getting resolved. This means banks are ready to give credit. A lot of work has been done on the corporate governance side. This will help capital distribution in the country. I have a positive view for India in the mid- to long-term.

When we judge if there are greenshoots, we look at how business enquiries have been for the 20 segments we have presence in. That indicates the planning and spend of customers. That is very strong right now.

What is happening in your robotics and automation business?

The market has improved in the robotics business. During the peak of COVID, in 2020, we inaugurated a large facility for robotics and automation, and, immediately after that, we secured some large orders.

I can't disclose the name due to a non-disclosure pact but we have an order from a very large player in India, which is acting on behalf of a global buyer. The scalability of that is very sophisticated. It’s a five-year repeating order. Ola secured all robotics supplies for their new mega factory from us. If you take the top five 5 FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) companies, they are acquiring a lot of robotics from us for advanced packaging.

The use of robotics has increased. Earlier, it was four robots per 10,000 workers; now, it is six.

This will continue to expand because if you want to make in India and export, you need robotics for flexibility and scale.

How is the process automation business doing?

We have two segments under this – energy and other sectors. On the energy side of the business, there has been quite a bit of investment and we have received some orders from the oil and gas sector in the last quarter of 2021. We are very selective about the power generation sector; but we have a very strong solid installed base which offers strong services opportunities.

In case of process industries automation, we now find that capex formation is quite visible and we are seeing strong conversion of orders.

Our other vertical– motion division– is all about energy efficiency. That’s the area where we are seeing quite good growth and our portfolio is quite well accepted in the market.

Your electrification products business is doing well. Are there any gaps you need to fill in the portfolio?

We have a portfolio we need. We start with medium voltage switchgears and technologies which go into the power distribution of these industries. Now, the focus is moving from power generation to improving the distribution side and that will see a lot of investment. The data centre is a new entrant and is growing quite rapidly. We see good scope of expansion in energy efficiency for buildings.

You have been hiving off businesses in the last few years. Are there any other businesses you would like to exit or any new businesses that you would like to add? What is the mergers and acquisitions strategy?

We are a 130-year-old company. We have survived this long and we continue to thrive because we know that as and when industrial and market cycles change, you have to shed some portfolio to stay relevant for the future. That’s what we have done.

Now, ABB has good cash balance at the global and local levels, and we are keen on organic growth. We continue to invest in the expansion of our portfolio and capacity. We are also very actively looking at inorganic options, both globally and in India. There are criteria set for each of our 18 divisions. They are empowered to expand their portfolio and we have a pipeline.

Given that, what is the capex for ABB’s plans in India? Have you earmarked any amount for acquisitions?

On an organic basis, we are expanding our factories and constructing new ones. We are also making good investments on our ESG initiatives. Typically, our rolling average is about Rs 100 crore a year, but it goes up and down based on order sizes.

As for M&A, they will be financed within the cash flows we generate. We will look at acquisitions not from the perspective of ticket size, but for the opportunity in the market and how much value they can add to us."

Power Grid Corporation of India share price was trading in the red on October 4. The stock price has been in focus as the government has been working on certain amendments to the Electricity Act that will focus on reforming India’s crippling power distribution companies.

At 10:29 hours, the stock was trading at Rs 192.05, up Rs 0.25, or 0.13 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 193.35 and an intraday low of Rs 190.20.

The share touched its 52-week high Rs 197.90 and 52-week low Rs 115.99 on 30 September, 2021 and 15 October, 2020, respectively.

Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) is geared up to benefit from the the upcoming auctions in the transmission space, according to an ICICI Securities report.

Opportunities on the horizon:

""Over FY22-26, we expect PGCIL to incur a capex of Rs 51,600 crore and commission assets worth Rs 76500 crore, taking its gross block from Rs 2,40,000 crore in FY21 to Rs 2,80,000 crore in FY24 and Rs 3,20,000 crore in FY26. With Power Grid InvIT now listed, a ready monetisation vehicle is available to PGCIL for its operational TBCB assets. This results in freeing up of capital as well as lower debt in its books, a good combination for future capex and growth,"" the research and brokring firm said.

""Since capex in transmission is expected to be steady going forward, for further growth PGCIL is looking to selectively invest in smart metering through the Rs 3,00,000-crore scheme, and in other new-age businesses including EV charging, battery energy storage, energy management, among others. Moderate capex requirement is also expected to boost dividend payouts.""

Catch all the market action on our live blog

ICICI Securities expects PGCIL to pay out greater than Rs 40 per share as dividend over FY22E-24E (60-65% on cumulative consolidated EPS of Rs 62.4 per share). Further, once 33 kV systems move into the purview of state transmission companies, we expect many of them to form JVs with PGCIL for capex in this segment, which will be a good growth opportunity for PGCIL, it said.

""We reinitiate coverage on Power Grid with buy rating and DCF-based target price of Rs 225 per share,"" the research firm added.

Monetisation of TBCB assets through the InvIT to bring capital efficiency and increase dividends:

In Q1FY22, Power Grid transferred 74% of its holdings in 5 SPVs to Power Grid Infrastructure Investment trust (PG InvIT) with a gross block of Rs 7,240 crore (balance 26% holdings in each SPVs to be transferred to the InvIT over Feb’22-Jan’24). The trust was listed at a valuation of Rs 9,100 crore. The firm received Rs 4,110 crore (out of the fresh issue of Rs 4,990 crore; OFS was for Rs 2,740 crore) and booked Rs 3,170 crore as profits during Q1FY22. As a ready investment vehicle, the trust stands to benefit as a preferred route for monetisation of PGCIL’s operational TBCB assets.

Valuations and dividend payout outlook:

ICICI Securities has reinitiated coverage on Power Grid with buy rating and discounted cash flow based target price of Rs 225 per share. The stock is currently trading at FY24E P/E of 8.8x, P/B of 1.6x, with a dividend yield of 7.8%.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Power Grid

PWGR's 1QFY22 result highlights the steady growth in its Transmission business, with underlying numbers increasing 12% YoY. Reported standalone PAT rose 3x YoY, led by gains on sale of assets to the InvIT. It has won INR90-100b of awards during the past 8-9 months, which is a positive sign, given a declining order book. The capex trajectory is on a decline, and with proceeds from InvIT, we see strong scope for higher dividends. Valuations at 1.6x FY22E P/BV and a 7-8% FY22E dividend yield remain attractive for a company with a steady RoE of 18%. We maintain our Buy rating with a DCF-based TP of INR205/share.



Outlook

Given a 7-8% dividend yield, backed by steady earnings growth (5-6% CAGR) and RoEs of 18%, PWGR remains attractively valued at 1.6x FY22E P/BV. We maintain our Buy rating with a DCF-based TP of INR205/share.

INR180b of awards are to be bid under various schemes; however, we are expecting some delays. In this context, a declining order book does put a risk of growth slowing down.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Power Grid

We analyzed details of Power Grid (PWGR)'s tariff-based competitive bidding (TBCB) projects from their annual reports. At an aggregate level, in our view, PWGR should be able to generate ~14% equity IRR (assuming a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20 for its 11 under-construction projects). Equity IRR for its eight commissioned TBCB projects varies in the range of 2-27%. TBCB currently remains small in the overall context (3% FY20 PAT; 5% gross block). However, with increased awarding at the interstate/intrastate level on a TBCB basis, its pie would eventually grow. Over the past one year, PWGR has won ~7 projects on a TBCB basis. We expect profits from TBCB projects to rise to INR7.8b in FY23 from INR3.7b as new projects get commissioned.

Outlook

However, subsequent lower capital expenditure (along with the removal of DDT) also implies potential for higher dividends. We expect DPS to rise to INR14.3/sh in FY22, from INR10/sh in FY20, implying FY22 dividend yield of ~8%. PWGR's stock trades at just 1.2x FY22E P/BV for steady long-term growth and an underpenetrated market. Maintain Buy, with DCF-based TP of INR223/sh.

Shares of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), Oil India (OIL), GAIL India, Power Grid Corporation of India and NTPC traded mixed in the morning trade on BSE after Fitch Ratings revised the outlook on these company's ratings.

Fitch said while ratings of IOC and BPCL are equalised with those of the sovereign given the strong likelihood of support, the same of GAIL and Power Grid are stronger than that of the sovereign at 'BBB' and 'BBB+', respectively. However, their ratings are capped at the same level as that of the state, according to the criteria.

The government's proposal to shift dividend distribution tax in the hands of investors will negatively impact NHAI and PowerGrid plans to raise funds through InvIT as higher tax incidence will make the instrument less attractive, rating agency Icra said.

In the Union Budget announced on February 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed removal dividend distribution tax (DDT), which will make dividend income from shares and mutual funds taxable in the hands of the unit-holder — instead of the company — at applicable income tax rates.

As per media reports, NHAI plans to initially raise Rs 15,000-20,000 crore and scale it up to Rs 40,000 crore later through monetisation of road assets, while PowerGrid Corporation has plans to monetise transmission assets of Rs 10,000 crore.

""As many as Rs 80,000 crore worth of InvITs were expected to be launched in 2020 of the Rs 2 trillion worth estimated in the next five years. However, the higher tax incidence in the hands of the unitholders will result in lower net-yield and reduced equity IRR, making equity raising a challenge,"" Icra Senior Vice-President Shubham Jain told reporters.

InvITs have been an attractive vehicle for developers to unlock capital deployed in operational projects and helps in reducing the cost of debt for infrastructure projects, he said.

""Also, foreign institutional investors find InvITs attractive due to their stable long-term returns, relatively lower risks because of operational portfolio and better corporate governance. If InvITs have to succeed, a conducive regime is the key and much would depend on regulatory and tax regime,"" Jain added.

According to Icra, domestic unit holders are likely to witness 34 per cent drop in returns, while foreign investors will witness around 22 per cent decline in returns.

Till date, Rs 22,000 crore have been raised from investors through InvITs, while another Rs 32,500 crore is in advanced stages.

Tower Infrastructure of Reliance Jio, a second InvIT from IRB–privately placed with GIC and acquisition of eight road assets by L&T's IndInfravit from Sadbhav are the ones in advanced stages.

Jain further said the Budget has also proposed full tax exemption to sovereign wealth funds, which could support higher participation from sovereign funds.

""Also, the amendment in definition of Business Trusts made to include unlisted private placed InvITs will lead to tax parity between unlisted and listed private placed InvITs resulting in former likely to gain prominence due to lower compliance cost,"" he added."

Despite being a fair distance away from record-high levels, Nifty's slow but steady rise toward 12,000 is good news for the Indian markets especially as more than 50 percent of the stocks in the index are available at attractive valuations.

About 23 companies, or nearly 50%, of the Nifty50 universe is trading at a discount to their 10-year P/E multiple, data from Motilal Oswal and AceEquity showed. These include Tata Steel, ONGC, Coal India, NTPC, JSW Steel, IOC, Gail India, Axis Bank, Power Grid, among others.

Even though the valuations appear mouthwatering, the questions remains– should you buy around these levels or one should stay put or avoid getting into these stocks altogether?

Investors must note that even though these stock appear attractive based on numbers, the fundamentals may present a different story. Most experts we spoke to opined that investors should tread cautiously when it comes to these stocks.

A Price-to-Earnings ratio or PE value the company is a ratio of current market price to its earnings per share. It also referred to as multiple. This measure of valuing the company is used by investors to filter out stocks for investment.

The golden rule of investment is to pour money in stocks that are trading at attractive levels compared to their intrinsic value, thus allowing investors to create wealth over a period of time.

“We would advise not to go by only the price decline from average price as average can shift further below. Key is to look at what are the business ecosystem that can drift the positives turn profitable for the company and how it reflects on share price,” Pritam Deuskar, Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“Today, it looks like as if the pharma sector has bottomed out but when it will start working nobody knows. The kind of infra spending, smart cities, airports, and construction budget till 2030 will come out, for sure some of these companies will benefit,” he said.

Well, markets are built on hope and everything gets priced well in advance. Fundamentally speaking, individual stock fundamentals and business developments matter more than just the price of the stock. Should investors bottom fish in some of these names?

“One has to carry out stock-specific analysis while bottom fishing stocks which are trading at a discount to their historical averages,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“Many of these stocks are cyclical, like Tata Steel, JSW Steel, ONGC and Coal India. These stocks are driven by their commodity-related specifics. Sustainable growth plays an important role while ascertaining a stock’s fundamentals. Sun Pharma and Zee have been in the news for corporate governance reasons, one of them might be out of the woods,” he said.

How relevant are long term averages?

Long term moving averages define the price action of a security. It is a good tool to use while analyzing market movements as valuations are key while analyzing indexes, suggest experts.

The golden rule is that if the index is trading at a significant premium above the moving average then it might be a good time to sell, and vice-versa. But, it should be used with other parameters such as price to book value, as well as moving averages.

“Buying stocks that are trading at deep discounts to long term moving average works better when this happens in cyclical industries. Moving averages like 200 DMA & 30 DMA acts as a general indicator of long term and short term trends,” Romesh Tiwari, Head of Research, CapitalAim told Moneycontrol.

“It must be used with other parameters like PE ratio and Price to book value to make long term buying and selling decisions in quality stocks,” he said.

The Indian market is down by about 9 percent from its record high, which has laid down the groundwork along with other domestic and global factors for a short term rally in high beta stocks.

The conditions for sustained outperformance of high beta and interest rate sensitive stocks are not developing structurally due to the weak private investment cycle. But, the impact of dovish FED, rise in global liquidity, surplus banking liquidity, stimulus announcements, and valuations could result in a short cycle (3-5 months) beta rally, ICICI Securities said in a report.

The report further added that the best high beta and interest rate sensitive stocks to play the rally from the coverage universe include stocks like SBI, Axis Bank, BPCL, NTPC, Power Grid, L&T, and Ultratech Cement.

Over the past one week, NIFTY50 fell marginally (-0.2 percent), underperforming against developed markets (DMs) and Emerging Markets (EMs), while mid-and-smallcaps fared better, up 0.9 percent and 0.6 percent respectively in the same period.

The valuations, too, turned favourable. Bond-Earnings yields spread is at 66bps (much below long-term averages or LTA). The market cap to GDP ratio is at 73 percent which is still lower than the LTA of 78 percent.

ICICI Securities highlights 6 factors which could lead to a beta rally in the near future (two-three months)

Impact of dovish FED on EM flows and currencies

The US FED bought treasuries worth US$14 billion over the past fortnight and is the first such instance of QE since it began its balance sheet reduction program in November 2017.

The dovish signal on rates and liquidity by the US FED and other central banks including India and China could result in a halt to the sharp portfolio outflows from EMs including India and halt the sharp depreciation in EM currencies.

Rising global liquidity will find its way to relatively high real yields for India

Trailing 30 days FPI flows (bonds+equities) have turned positive for India at ~US$300 million, which is also positively impacting the INR.

India real bond yield at 3.4 percent is amongst the highest within EMs and a stable INR could continue to attract foreign capital.

Surplus banking liquidity to surge further

The surplus liquidity in the banking system has consistently stayed above the Rs 1 trillion mark since July and could surge further based on the positive trends in the key drivers of liquidity.

The continued surplus liquidity will also result in excess bank reserves thereby boosting the money multiplier which dipped in FY19 to 5.6 from 5.8 in FY18.

Oil prices continue to be weak

Weakening oil prices thereby support the CAD or the current account deficit outlook while above average monsoon (3 percent surplus as of September 9) to support rural demand.

Government action on policy front

Pro-growth policy announcements and the room to spend after the RBI’s transfer of Rs 1.76 trillion to the government will keep optimism high.

Micro Triggers

The August PMI is soft but is still expanding MoM while the business optimism remains high. The weak growth narrative will continue but may not spring any negative surprise in the short term.

ICICI Direct's research report on Power Grid

Power Grid reported Q1FY20 results that were below our estimates as revenues were lower than expected led by single digit growth in transmission revenues. Capitalisation booked in Q1FY20 was below expectations. Reported revenues came in at Rs 8804.1 crore vs. estimate of Rs 9358.2 crore. Transmission revenues for Q1FY20 grew 8.3% YoY at Rs 8651.2 crore vs. our estimate of Rs 9015 crore (14% YoY). On the other hand, consultancy revenues declined 16.9% YoY at Rs 126.3 crore while telecom revenues grew marginally by 1.4% YoY to Rs 194 crore. EBITDA came in at Rs 7896.4 crore, below our estimate of Rs 7973.2 crore. Had other expenses at Rs 409.7 crore in Q1FY20 (vs. Rs 747.9 crore in Q1FY19) not been lower, the EBITDA miss would have been steeper.

Outlook

Hence, we continue to value at a P/B multiple of 1.3x FY21E BV with a fair value of Rs 210 per share.

Nifty infra index has been trading in a range since the past few months and witnessed wild swings during June. However, the index is now out of its consolidation phase and has given multiple breakouts on weekly charts.

The index has witnessed a double bottom breakout above 3,325 that if held can lead to strong upside in coming weeks.

The index has also given breakout from bullish flag pattern on weekly charts which implies the uptrend that it had captured earlier is likely to continue.

Based on the patterns discussed earlier, the index can touch 3,525, which if held can lead to a further rise till 3,725, keep a stop-loss below 3,250.



Sectors tend to remain strong if the heavy components witness strong uptrend. In this case, L&T has been witnessing strong up move. The stock gave a consolidation breakout above Rs 1,450 and since then it has been holding the breakout levels.

The stock is now forming bullish pennant formation on weekly charts with a breakout at higher levels. This implies once a breakout is confirmed the index will also witness a push.

Siemens is another crucial component to witness multiple breakouts on the weekly charts. The stock has witnessed a rounding bottom breakout along with bullish flag breakout on daily and weekly charts.

RSI has also given a small breakout which implies the stock can continue to witness some upside and it can scale towards Rs 1,400.

Power Grid is one of the slowest moving components of Nifty Infra index. However, after a very strong consolidation, the stock has given a strong breakout on weekly charts.

The stock witnessed triple bottom breakout with incremental volumes along with falling trendline breakout. The stock is trading above all major moving averages along with a breakout in RSI implying the trend is likely to remain strong. The stock can test Rs 220-230 in coming days.

The June series started with a good amount of long positions and recorded a new all-time high of 12,103 in initial days of June expiry. But, the bulls failed to hold Nifty above 12,000 marks as we witnessed some selling pressure from higher levels.

However, the index managed to sustain above the upper-end of the gap area, which was formed on the Exit Poll result day and showed some strength in the last week of the June series.

The Nifty50 remained in a broader range of 480 points in June series and, eventually, concluded the month with marginal loss over its May series close.

In the June series, we have not seen any significant activity on the open interest front. However, some of the long positions got carried forward to the July series as rollovers in Nifty stood at 80.35 percent, which is much higher than its quarterly average of 73.35 percent.

But, the open interest remained flat on an expiry-on-expiry basis. In the June expiry, FIIs activity remained subdued in the cash market segment as they were net buyers in equities worth Rs. 502 crores only.

On the other hands, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) remained net buyers in cash market segment by Rs. 3,855 crores. The highest open interest for July’s monthly expiry is placed at 11,000 and 11,500 put and 12,000 and 12,500 call options.

Going forward, 11,500 – 11,450 would act as a strong support for Nifty while the immediate resistance can be seen around 12,050 – 12,100 levels.

Since overall positions are light in Nifty, a fresh build-up in the coming few days will decide the trend for the July series.

The banking index has started correcting from the first trading session of the June series, but the fall was not supported by fresh short positions. We witnessed some long unwinding in the first fortnight of the June expiry.

However, the rally of the last few days was on the back of fresh long build-up. Some of these long positions also got rolled to the next series as rollover (80.94 percent) in BankNifty was higher than its last three month’s average of 76.38 percent.

Despite the high rollovers in percentage terms, one should not get carried away with it as this rollover figure is on a low base of total open interest.

If we look at the data from a month-on-month basis, we are seeing a reduction in open interest by 6.09 percent.

Except for some long build-up in ICICI Bank, we have not seen any noticeable long build-up in any other banking counters. On the other hand, some banking stocks like Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, IndusInd Bank and RBL Bank have seen a decent short build-up, and the same got carried forward to the next series.

Though the June series remained marginally negative for benchmark indices, we saw carnage in many mid-cap counters. The two-third of the stocks from derivatives segment saw decent selling pressure in the June series, which does not bode well for the bulls.

At the current juncture, we are witnessing long rollovers in stocks like Torrent Power, Power Grid, PFC, REC Ltd, Havells India, and NTPC etc.

The stocks which added huge shorts in the June series but got rolled to the coming month are GAIL, Glenmark, Ujjivan, Jindal Steel, Equitas, TVS Motor, Escorts, and L&T Finance Holdings, etc.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Power Grid

4QFY19 standalone (S/A) reported PAT grew 52% YoY to INR30.5b, boosted by prior-period sales and other likely one-offs on annual tariff adjustments. For FY19, S/A reported PAT rose ~21% YoY to INR99.4b even as gross block (proxy for regulated equity) grew by ~12% YoY. The growth was aided by prior-period revenue of ~INR2.8b and other one-offs. S/A capitalization stood at INR192b in FY19 (INR64b in Q4FY19) v/s INR273b in the previous year. Group capitalization stood at INR258b. PAT of TBCB companies increased INR1.5b YoY to INR1.9b in FY19 on commissioning of three projects (to seven now) and a weaker base. Consol. PAT grew by a healthy 22% YoY to INR100.3b, led by a 15% YoY increase in gross block and a weaker base in TBCB. PWGR took a provision of INR3.9b pertaining to delay in payment by a private generator that is under stress. This is surprising given the assured return model of PWGR. PWGR loses revenue for the period when a generator defaults/relinquishes on a transmission line and until the asset is transferred under the POC mechanism.

Outlook

At CMP, the stock is trading attractively at 1.5x FY20E P/BV. RoE is strong at ~16-17%, while cost of equity (CoE) is ~10-11%. PWGR has ~INR700b (incl. CWIP) of projects pending capitalization that provides visibility of earnings growth. Maintain Buy with a DCF-based target price of INR233.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Power Grid

Power Grid’s (PWGR) PAT increased ~14% YoY to INR23.3b in 3QFY19, broadly in line with our estimate. PAT adjusted for the prior period and the impact of wage revision was up ~9% YoY to INR23.6b (+9.2% YoY for 9MFY19). Receivables have nearly doubled in nine months to INR70.6b, as beneficiaries are delaying payments. Standalone capitalization stood at ~INR127b in 9MFY19 (INR68.6b in 3Q), as against ~INR195b in 9MFY18. The company also capitalized ~INR39b of TBCB projects during the year. PWGR guided for capitalization of INR260b for FY19 (incl. INR60b for TBCB projects). Capex stood at ~INR182b for 9MFY19. Telecom revenue/EBIT increased 13%/38% YoY to INR2.0b/INR1.1b in 3QFY19. Consultancy revenue increased 9% YoY to INR1.6b, but EBIT declined 15% YoY to INR0.7b in 3QFY19. Transmission revenue/EBIT grew ~13/11% YoY, along with 12% growth in derived PAT. Adj. PAT growth though was lower at ~8% YoY (adj. for prior period and wage impact) for 3QFY19. Management highlighted that the government has envisaged transmission projects of ~INR433b. Of these, ~INR160b are to be bid out in the next one year.

Outlook

The stock is trading at a dividend yield of ~10-12% for an assured return model and state-backed revenues (g-sec yield is ~7 to 8%). Maintain Buy.

Jitendra Kumar GuptaMoneycontrol Research

Which set of stocks give you healthy cash levels, attractive valuations, good dividend yields, decent return ratios, significant competitive advantages and the absence of promoter risks? If you answered PSU stocks, that’s correct.

PSU scrips have typically attracted those seeking value. Despite their huge appeal, they have often turned out to be wealth destroyers. Total returns from 44 listed non-bank PSU stocks were a mere 3 percent annual growth over the last five years. While the metrics may seem attractive, the returns call for caution.

There are good reasons for their shares underperforming. Between fiscal 2014 and 2018, the companies in this study delivered a mere 1.5 percent revenue growth and 0.7 percent net profit growth annually.

The value mirage

That’s why investors should get not carried away by low valuations. For instance, Steel Authority of India or SAIL in March 2014 was at around Rs 56 a share, available at 0.6 times its book value against its historical average of 1-1.2 times. That may have been inviting. But today, even at 0.6 times its book value, SAIL remains cheap at Rs 51 a share. A buyer in 2014 would be sitting on losses even today.

SAIL is not alone; several PSUs including Coal India, BHEL, GAIL India, HPCL, BPCL and many others where investors got attracted to valuations have actually turned out to be so-called value traps in the absence of earnings growth.

On paper, PSU stocks have turned cheap. The PSUs studied are trading at an average of 11 times their earnings in FY18 against 16 times in FY15. Their price to book value of 1.4 times is 30 basis points lower than their FY15 levels. They can, at best be valued based on dividends. Investors who take the plunge do so, based on other factors such as a potential recovery in earnings and cash flows and often end up regretting it.

An interesting case is that of NTPC, which is struggling to grow earnings. Since returns are regulated, investors prefer to value it based on dividends. During fiscal 2014-18, it reported 2.5 percent annual revenue growth whereas profit declined by 3 percent annually. Investors who had applied earnings-based valuation methods, thinking someday these stocks will be valued as growth stocks, made a mistake. Even today, despite attractive valuations, it continues to offer a 3.8 percent dividend yield.

Slow growth trajectory

A chief cause of wealth destruction in PSU stocks is growth; or the lack of it. Of the 44 listed PSUs covered here, half reported a decline in revenues over the past four fiscals. These companies dragged down overall annual revenue growth on an aggregate basis to merely 1.5 percent. What about the remaining half that saw revenues grow? Their aggregate sales rose by 8.8 percent annually on average in the past four fiscals.

Consider the performance of three leading PSU miners NMDC, MOIL and Coal India. Despite a monopoly position and good demand from user industries, miners reported a decline in profits led by reasons such as higher employee cost and inability to scale business.

Scalability is a big constraint due to delays in decision making and inadequate planning. For instance, NMDC decided it will also make steel in addition to mining iron ore, which fuelled investor expectation. But delays and a change in plans has now resulted in the company deciding to exit this project.

In 2013, SAIL had plans to double its 13-million-tonne capacity in two to three years. In fiscal 2014, out of Rs 60,000 crore fixed capital employed in the business, Rs 33,000 crore was tied to these expansion projects shown as capital work in progress. Because of the huge delays in the expansion, it not only weakened its balance sheet but allowed others such as Tata Steel and JSW Steel to increase their market share.

Companies with a monopoly find their profits are protected even if they cannot scale up. Once the market opens up, as was seen in the case of BHEL and MTNL, competition erodes their market position and share valuations.

Managerial ability is underwhelming

Often growth and scalability have suffered because of the ability of management. To put in perspective, between FY14 and FY18, BHEL’s net profit declined 30 percent annually and net worth by close to a percent annually as a result of drying market opportunities in the power equipment market accounted for close to 80 percent of its revenue. While peers survive, BHEL lost on strategic thinking and initiatives. In one of the reports prepared by Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) last year titled, 'Competitiveness of BHEL in emerging markets', it cited reasons such as lack of timely diversification for the poor financial performance.

Ignoring the tenets of wealth creation

Poor capital allocation and reluctance to return surplus cash to shareholders has also marred the prospects of PSUs. Companies in our study have consistently kept cash and investments to the tune of 32-40 percent of the equity capital invested in the business which is quite high resulting in low return ratios and eroding capital.

While companies during fiscal 2014-18 delivered 1.5 percent annual revenue growth, their other income has risen by 7.5 percent annually. Thus, profit growth to an extent has been helped by growth in other income.

Still, funds in the bank yield less than returns generated in their core business. Investors also fear misallocation of funds such as in the case of Coal India investing surplus cash for operating power generation plants.

In sum, public sector shares may seem like low hanging fruits but they are likely to leave a bitter aftertaste.

Intent on fulfilling its divestment target before FY19-end, the Finance Ministry wants to push through at least two more merger and acquisition deals among government-owned energy companies, after the recent deal between Power Finance Corporation and REC, reported The Economic Times.

Senior government officials told the paper that there are plans to make power generation major NTPC a holding company of the energy sector by acquiring three or more state-run companies.

First, NTPC will buy the government's 64 percent stake in SJVN, which will raise around Rs 6,500 crore at current valuation. At the same time, NHPC could acquire the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation from the government, an official told the paper.

In the plan's next phase, transmission companies like Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) may be brought in with NHPC to create a big power sector behemoth under NTPC, the official added. Smaller central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) like the Damodar Valley Corporation could also be included in this plan.

""Essentially, NTPC becomes the holding company, with all these entities under its umbrella, but each company will retain management control,"" the official told the paper.

Of its divestment target of Rs 80,000 crore, the government has only raised Rs 32,997 crore this fiscal. ""This is not being done with the sole idea of disinvestment but for creating strong entities that can compete globally,"" another official said.

Last week, the government received the Cabinet's approval to sell its entire 52.63 percent stake in power sector financing company REC to PFC, which is expected to fetch the Centre Rs 14,000 crore.

Atanu Chakrabarty, Secretary to the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (Dipam), recently said he is confident the government will meet its target. ""Pawan Hans, for which proposals have been invited, has received substantial competitive interest,"" he had said."

Motilal Oswal's research report on Power Grid

Power Grid’s (PWGR) PAT increased ~8% YoY to INR23.1b (our estimate: INR23.9b) in 2QFY19, as growth in Transmission was partly offset by a decline in Consultancy and Telecom businesses. PAT adjusted for prior period and wage revision impact increased ~10% YoY. Capitalization stood at ~INR84b in 1HFY19, as against ~INR138b in 1HFY18. Capitalization also includes the foreign exchange rate variation (FERV) impact of ~INR25b in 1HFY19, which does not earn RoE. Execution was slow in 1H (excluding FERV), which increases the asking rate for 2HFY19. PWGR incurred capex of ~INR122b in 1HFY19.

Outlook

Maintain Buy with a DCF-based target price of INR249/share.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Power Grid

We analyzed the tariff-based competitive bidding (TBCB) projects from the annual reports of Power Grid’s (PWGR) subsidiaries. In our view, PWGR will generate more than 14% equity IRR (debt/equity ratio of 80/20) on its TBCB projects. The equity IRR on the three projects that are fully commissioned is ~24-38%. PWGR enjoys a competitive edge due to its (a) low cost of borrowed funds, (b) dominant position with suppliers and (c) vast geographical spread, which should continue driving healthy returns.

Outlook

If we were to assume no growth after FY20, which means PAT is available for dividend distribution, the stock is trading at an attractive dividend yield of ~11% for an assured return model and revenues backed by state-guarantees (g-sec yield is ~7 to 8%). We re-iterate our Buy rating with a DCF-based target price of INR287/share.For all recommendations report, click here

The Nifty50 slipped by about 2 percent for the week ended March 23 with the index closing below its crucial support level placed at 10,000. The week started on a positive note but the momentum fizzled out soon after US President Donald Trump ignited Trade War woes.

First four day’s price action of Nifty50 was almost neutral with two positive pull back candles and two bearish candles. But, Friday’s huge gap-down move accompanied by the global uncertainty created havoc on Indian markets.

This has technically tilted the balance in favour of bears who are already on a rampage since February 2018. However, as the market already corrected in the last two months with a price damage of around 10 percent the incentives for bears after Friday’s gap down opening appears to be little.

Hence, around current level which is close to critical 38.2 percent, retracement level of entire rally from December 2016 lows of 7893 to 11171, some sort of stability can’t be ruled out.

However, if the market in its own wisdom decides to breach 9900 level then major support appears to be in the zone of 9736 – 9685 levels.

Interestingly, on the price chart, around August 2017 Nifty50 spent considerable time as it consolidated between the levels of 10135 to 9685 levels for 8-weeks before breaking out. Hence, 9700 level assumes a lot of significance and can be considered as a sacrosanct support on the downside.

Here is a list of top buy or sell ideas by experts for the coming week which could give up to 13% return:

SMC Global Securities:

Marico Ltd: BUY | Target: Rs 370| Stop loss: Rs 300| Return 13%

The stock closed at Rs 325.55 on March 23, 2018. It made a 52-week low at Rs 284.15 on February 6, 2018 and a 52-week high of Rs 348.70 on September 13, 2017.

The 200-days Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the stock on the daily chart is currently at Rs 308.86. As we can see on the chart that stock was consolidating in the range of 290-330 levels for three months and formed a “Symmetrical Triangle” on the weekly charts and has given the breakout of the pattern.

Last week, the stock has registered gains over 8 percent and managed to close above the breakout level with high volume.

Moreover, it has also formed a long bullish candle on weekly charts which also suggest buying for the stock. Therefore, one can buy in the range of Rs 318-322 levels for the upside target of Rs 360-370 levels with a stop loss below Rs 300.

Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

JK Lakshmi Cement: BUY | Target: Rs 503| Stop loss: Rs 405| Return 11%

For the last couple of weeks, this counter was in consolidation mode in the range of 440 – 410 levels and appears to have broken out of this range in Friday’s session. Hence, traders can look for a target of 503 and consider buying now and on declines up to 425 with a stop of Rs405.

Pidilite Industries Ltd: BUY | Target: Rs 970| Stop loss: Rs 885| Return 7%

This counter appears to be in a pause mode after a vertical rise from the lows of Rs 858 to Rs 924 levels. As long-term trends are looking quite attractive and the fact this scrip is consolidating near to its lifetime highs there is more upside once it breaks out of the range. Hence, this corrective phase should be utilised by traders to go long in this counter for an initial target of Rs 970 with a stop of Rs 885.

Power Grid: BUY | Target: Rs 211| Stop loss: Rs 187| Return 8%

With seven months of correction from the highs of Rs 226, this counter appears to have hit a bottom after retracing 62 percent of its last leg of the rally from the November 2016 lows of Rs 166.

Correction at recent lows of Rs 190 appears to have ended in this counter as it started building a base in a narrow range of Rs 190 – 199 levels.

Once it breaks out above 199 then a fresh leg of uptrend shall start with an initial target of Rs 211. Positional traders should buy into this in anticipation of such a breakout, and a Stop advised for the trade will be Rs 187.

Analyst: Rajesh Palviya, Head – Technical & Derivatives Analyst, Axis Securities

Marico: CMP: Rs327 | BUY | Target: Rs 355| Stop loss: Rs 310| Return 8%

For the week, Marico has witnessed bounce back from Rs 300 level which is a multi-week support for the stock. Another prominent observation on the price chart of Marico is that the entire consolidation underway since January 2018 till date has formed a down-sloping trend line.

The breakout of this trend line is witnessed at Rs 311 level on the weekly chart. The stock is sustaining above its 20-days moving average which supports bullish sentiments ahead.

On the volumes front, the stock has witnessed significant rise around breakout level indicating increased participation on the rally.

Both weekly and monthly strength indicator RSI along with the momentum indicator Stochastic are in bullish territory and sustaining above their reference lines which signals strength and upward momentum in price. Thus, taking into consideration the above factors, the maximum upside can be expected to Rs 350-355.

Titan Company Ltd: BUY | CMP: Rs 895 | Target: Rs 960| Stop loss: Rs 850 | Return 7%

Titan Company is in an uptrend across all the time frames forming higher top - higher bottom formation. Since Jan 2018, the stock was in major consolidation mode within Rs 890-790 band on the weekly chart.

It gave a breakout at Rs 890 levels and is sustaining above the same. The stock is also sustaining above its 20, 50 and 100 SMA which supports bullish sentiments ahead.

Both daily & weekly strength indicator RSI along with the momentum indicator Stochastic are in bullish territory and sustaining above their reference lines which signals strength and upward momentum in price. Thus, taking into consideration the above factors, the maximum upside can be expected to Rs 960-975.

GE Power India Ltd: BUY | CMP: Rs 860| Target: Rs 945| Stop loss: Rs 825 | Return 10%

Since February 2018, the stock was in major consolidation mode within Rs 860-800 band on the daily chart. It has also formed Hammer like candlestick formation on the weekly chart indicating buying support at lower levels.

The stock is sustaining above its 20-days moving average which supports bullish sentiments ahead. On the volumes front, the stock has witnessed significant rise around breakout level indicating increased participation on the rally.

The daily strength indicator RSI along with the momentum indicator Stochastic are in bullish territory and sustaining above their reference lines which signals strength and upward momentum in price. Thus, taking into consideration the above factors, the maximum upside can be expected to Rs 930-945.

Analyst: Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com

Manappuram Finance Ltd: BUY | Target: Rs 116 | Stop loss: Rs 98 | Return 10%

Despite trading in a sideways direction, Manappuram made a strong rebound in the last trading session to form an uptrend channel on its price chart.

The scrip continued to take a strong support from Rs 101-98 level, and decisively managed to break out from its 200-days EMA level coupled with strong volume growth.

The scrip formed a bullish candlestick pattern on its daily price chart coupled with positive cues from its MACD and Signal Line.

Further, the relative strength index or the RSI level signaled upwards bias. The support level for scrip is currently placed at Rs 96 and resistance level from the upper band at Rs 123. We have a BUY recommendation for Manappuram Finance which is currently trading at Rs 105.80

ADF Food Ltd: SELL| Target: Rs 182 | Stop loss: Rs 208 | Return 7%

ADF Food continued to consolidate on its daily price movement despite gaining a momentum on an intraday basis at Rs 208 level but failed to vindicate the momentum, and slipped below its second support band.

The scrip continued to decline with about 12 percent on weekly basis, and weak support on volume front indicating a negative trajectory.

The scrip formed a strong bearish candlestick pattern on its weekly price chart as price continued to trade below all the moving average level which indicates a strong downtrend.

Further, the secondary momentum indicator continued to indicate negative signal with RSI -20.6 at oversold level coupled with weak support from MACD trend.

The scrip is facing a resistance at Rs 213 levels and support at Rs 176 levels which will remain crucial for scrip. We have a SELL recommendation for ADF Food which is currently trading at Rs 195.50

Oil India Ltd: BUY | Target: Rs 370 | Stop loss: Rs 335 | Return 6%

After consolidating across Rs 319 levels, Oil India continued to trade on uptrend trajectory for a two consecutive session as it managed to breakout from its 50-days EMA levels indicating a positive signal.

The scrip also witnessed a volume breakout from its average level and managed to close on positive cues with about 3 percent gain on intraday basis during the last closing session.

On the daily price chart, the scrip made a solid bullish candlestick pattern coupled with RSI indicating a price just trading above its crucial resistance level.

The RSI at 55 levels indicates a favorable buying regime together with a strong cue from MACD and Signal Line. The scrip is now facing a resistance at Rs 388 levels and support level at Rs 328. We have a BUY recommendation for Oil India which is currently trading at Rs 349.95

If the market decides to breach 9,900 levels, then the next major support appears to be in the 9,736–9,685 zone, Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist–Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in, said in an interview to Moneycontrol's Kshitij Anand.

Q: It was a volatile week for Indian markets and a lot has changed on the charts. The Nifty broke below its crucial 200-DEMA and 10,000 level for the first time since October 2017. Do you see the further pain in the market for the coming week?

A: The first four day’s price action of Nifty50 was almost neutral with two positive pull back candles and two bearish candles. But, Friday’s huge gap-down, accompanied by global uncertainty, created havoc in Indian markets.

This has technically tilted the balance in favour of bears who are already on a rampage since February 2018. However, as the market already corrected in the last two months, with a price damage of around 10 percent, the incentives for bears after Friday’s gap down opening appears to be little.

Hence, around current levels, which is close to the critical 38.2% retracement level of the entire rally from December 2016 lows of 7,893 to 11,171, some sort of stability can’t be ruled out.

If the market in its own wisdom decides to breach 9,900 levels, then the next major support appears to be in the 9,736–9,685 zone.

Interestingly, on the price chart, the Nifty50 spent considerable time in August last year as it consolidated between levels of 10,135 and 9,685 for eight-weeks before breaking out. Hence, 9,700 level assumes a lot of significance and can be considered as sacrosanct support on the downside.

Q: How are FIIs positioned in the market? Do you think the Fed rate hike and fears of trade war could push them to change their stance towards Indian markets?

A: In February, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net sellers to the tune of Rs 11,037 crore, but till March 22 they remained net buyers to the extent of Rs 8,368 crore before Trump's tariff mania hit the market.

It means that in March FIIs were bit positive. The Fed rate hike was known and was hence well factored in the price. But now there is a lot more uncertainty on account of newly started tariff war.

If one were to look at the trade statistics, one would be compelled to conclude that India may not be much impacted by this in the long run. India is the United States ninth largest trading partner and maintains a miniscule trade surplus of around $23 billion, unlike China which has a huge trade surplus of around $375 billion.

Hence, we are of the view that FIIs may not worry much on account of these two factors unless the trade wars escalate and more members like China or the European Union etc also start retaliating against the USA which will certainly lead to a slowdown in the world economy.

FIIs may worry more about domestic issues going forward. One is on PSU banking front. The Nirav Modi saga should turn out to be a blessing in disguise, provided the government implements radical reforms in the PSU banking space and aggressively consider selling at least some of the smaller banks to private players. By doing so they would be setting an example that they are committed to hardcore reforms when it is the need of the hour.

This may provide a much-needed fillip to the domestic economy and also help in winning over the confidence of foreign investors.

The second domestic issue which may worry FIIs is the 2019 general elections. Recent electoral results suggest the emergence of new alliances which has the potential to strongly challenge the incumbent government in the 2019 polls.

In that case, lack of a political alternative or strong government may temporarily keep FIIs in dilemma about the India investments.

Q: What should be the ideal strategy for mid- and small-caps which are underperforming benchmark indices by a wide margin?

A: The mid and small-cap space has already taken a severe knockdown. As growth visibility improves and fundamental news flows strengthen, investors should focus on quality names and use this correction to accumulate stocks at lower levels, preferably on declines up to 9,700, in a staggered manner.

Q: What should be the strategy - buy on dips or sell on rallies - in the coming week?

A) Long-term trends for Indian markets are still positive. The current correction can be a multi-month corrective phase inside a long-term bull market.

Since 2014, we have seen vertical rallies as well as multi-month corrections on a couple of occasions. For instance, after a vertical up move of 13 months from the lows of 5,933, the market topped out at a high of 9,119 in March 2015 and was in corrective mode for the next 11 months.

Similarly, in September 2016, the market took a breather for four months. Now, after witnessing 13-months of vertical up move from the lows of 7,893 to 11,171 we hardly spent two months correcting.

Hence, the present correction has a lot more time to go before ushering in a big up move. Time-wise, this correction can last for another two-to-three months.

But the bull market is certainly not over. Hence, dips should be bought into for one more leg on the upside which should take indices beyond 11,200 levels over a period of time.

Q: What are your top three-to-five technical stock picks at current levels?

A) Even in this carnage, there are certain scrips which managed to keep their head above the water and hence can be considered for long side trading in next week.

JK Lakshmi Cement: BUY | Target: Rs 503| Stop loss: Rs 405| Return: 11%

For the last couple of weeks, this counter was in consolidation mode in the range of Rs 440–410 levels and appears to have broken out of this range in Friday’s session. Hence, traders can look for a target of Rs 503 and consider buying now and on declines up to Rs 425 with a stop of Rs 405.

Pidilite Industries Ltd: BUY | Target: Rs 970| Stop loss: Rs 885| Return: 7%

This counter appears to be in a pause mode after a vertical rise from the lows of Rs 858 to Rs 924 levels. As long-term trends are looking quite attractive, and the fact this scrip is consolidating near its lifetime highs, there is more upside once it breaks out of the range. Hence, this corrective phase should be utilised by traders to go long in this counter for an initial target of Rs 970 with a stop loss of Rs 885.

Power Grid: BUY | Target: Rs 211 | Stop loss: Rs 187| Return: 8%

With seven months of correction from the highs of Rs 226, this counter appears to have hit a bottom after retracing 62% from November 2016 lows of Rs 166. Correction at recent lows of Rs 190 appears to have ended in this counter as it started building a base in a narrow range of Rs 190-199 levels.

Once it breaks out above Rs 199 then a fresh leg of uptrend shall start with an initial target of Rs 211. Positional traders should buy into this in anticipation of such a breakout, and a stop loss advised for the trade will be Rs 187.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Power Grid

Power Grid’s (PWGR) 3QFY18 underlying PAT increased ~16% YoY to INR22.5b (est. INR21.6b), as strong growth in transmission was partly offset by a decline in the consultancy business. Underlying PAT is after adjusting for the impact of INR1.4b for pay revision (likely to be recovered in future) and INR0.7b for prior-period items. Reported PAT was at INR20.4b.

Outlook

We further cut RoE to 12% and growth to just 3% (~22% re-investment). We roll forward the TP to FY20E. The TP increases to INR282/share, which implies a P/BV ratio of 2.0x.

The rating is subject to the agency's review of the final issuance documentation, S&P said in a statement.

""The rating on Power Grid reflects the company's supportive regulatory framework, near monopoly in interstate transmission, and stable margins and cash flows. Power Grid's large capital spending plans and exposure to the weak credit profiles of state electricity boards offset these strengths,"" it said.

The stable outlook on Power Grid, it said, reflects S&P's expectation that the company will manage its growth and project execution risks such that it maintains its ratio of funds from operations to debt at about nine per cent over the next 12-18 months.

Jitendra Kumar GuptaMoneycontrol Research

In FY17, Power Grid (PGCIL) awarded projects worth around Rs 30,000 crore, compared to Rs 16,000 crore of projects the year before. The PGCIL management has clarified that this spurt is an aberration which usually happens in the last year of the Five Year Plan as state-owned firms try to meet targets.

The management has cautioned about further moderation in project awarding over the next two years.

PGCIL is facing challenges because of the new rules which call for competitive bidding. Earlier, the government used to hand projects on a platter to PGCIL. The change in rules is hurting PGCIL.

It is worrying to think of a scenario where the annual awarding of projects by PGCIL drops to say FY15 or FY16 levels. That could imply about Rs 12000-15000 crore reduction in projects awarded over the next two years. So what does this mean for power equipment companies which get a good chunk of their orders from PGCIL?

Short-term jitters

While investors have already started fretting, the good part is that these are short-term hiccups and the market is overlooking the long term opportunities in the sector.

""There is a shift underway; instead of PGCIL, the orders are coming from state utilities, private players, railways and renewal energy space,"" said management of GE T&D (formerly Alstom T&D India) on an investors’ call.

GE T&D, which is the leading player in the power transmission and distribution space, saw a 41 percent drop in its order inflows to Rs 730 crore during the September quarter. The orders that it got were mostly from from private sector companies like Amara Raja Power, ABB, CPCL and few others. GE T&D is not alone; others like KEC International too reported a 54 percent drop in order inflows to Rs 1,110 crore during the quarter gone by.

Shift from interstate to intra-state

While private capex is one avenue, the companies are waiting for the opportunities from state governments lining up intra-state transmission projects. A large part of the Rs 2.6 lakh crore to be invested in transmission sector during the FY17-22 (estimated to be 50 percent or Rs 1.3 lakh crore or about Rs 26000 crore annually) has been earmarked for intra-state transmission capacity. Government’s focus is now on providing last mile connectivity and electrifying villages.

The other important segment that is coming up for the bidding is railway electrification. This year the government intends to electrify close to 4000 route km (Rkm) of its railway lines, which is a quantum jump as against the electrification of 2500 Rkm last year. It is estimated that close to 66 percent of the current railway network of 70,000 km is yet to be electrified. The Railway Ministry is estimated to spend around Rs 35,000 crore to meet its target of electrifying its entire network by 2022.

During the analyst call, Vimal Kejriwal, MD and CEO of KEC International, said there was some slowdown in orders because of the GST and deferment of railway projects, but the company is hopeful of pickup in activity. KEC International, which has about 25 percent market share in railway electrification, received orders worth Rs 140 crore in the first half of FY18. It has submitted bids of close to Rs 7000 crore and is hoping to get orders worth Rs 2000 crore in FY18.

Strong revenue visibility

When one adds up the investment amount as mentioned to be spent in other markets or non-PGCIL customers, there is enough and more for private power equipment players. Even if there is some slowdown anticipated, the other important point is that the companies in the T&D sector are sitting on good revenue visibility because of the strong outstanding order position. Companies like KEC International, Kalpataru Power, GE T&D and others are all sitting on orders worth about two times their revenues in FY17.

Shifting to more risky clients

One pitfall of this shift in business towards the non-PGCIL clients, is that if companies rely too much on the state-run utilities and projects, they might face working capital issue and increased pressure on the balance sheet because of the poor financial health of most states.

State-owned Power Grid Corp will soon begin commercial operations of 1,500 MW second pole of Champa-Kurukshetra high-voltage direct current line, which is likely to improve power supplies to Northern India, industry sources said.

Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and adjoining areas are expected to benefit from operationalisation of the second pole of the high voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission link.

It will mainly interconnect the independent power producers in Chhattisgarh as they will be able to supply power to northern states.

""Power Grid has successfully completed trial operations of 1,500 MW, Pole-II of ±800kV HVDC Champa-Kurukshetra transmission system. The pole would soon be put to commercial operations after seeking regulator's approval,"" an independent power producer said.

The first pole of 1,500 MW of the HVDC link has already started commercial operations earlier in March this year. The link's capacity will be enhanced to 3,000 MW after the second pole begins commercial operation. The link has four poles of 1,500 MW each.

The source further said the 3,000 MW capacity will be available for evacuation of power from energy resource region of Chhattisgarh including Chamoa, Raigarh and Raipur; to Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and adjoining areas.

The first pole of the HVDC Terminal at Champa along with 2,576 km Champa-Kurukshetra HVDC Transmission line was commissioned at a total cost of about Rs 6,300 crore.

This transmission system is further being upgraded to 6,000 MW capacity at an additional cost of Rs 5,200 crore. The entire project of 6,000 MW capacity is expected to be completed by December 2018.

The transmission system has been designed using HVDC Technology and will facilitate in meeting controlled power flow requirement, the flexibility of operation as well as maintaining system parameters within limits through its control mechanism.

The link augments the inter-regional capacity of the Northern region with the Western region, thereby facilitating the economic dispatch of power and exchange of surplus power between the Northern region and Western region, depending on the availability of generation and load demand in each region."

The Nifty50 broke past its previous record high of 10,137 on Monday to witness a fresh record high of 10,160 led by gains in Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto, and L&T. The mid & small cap index too witnessed respective record highs in opening trade.

It witnessed an overwhelming momentum during last week trading session as it assertively managed to close above its earlier psychological level placed at 10,050 which was a positive sign.

After consolidating for nearly 3 to 4 weeks, our markets showed some encouraging movement as we saw index marching towards record high of 10137.85.

In fact, a couple of valiant attempts to traverse this hurdle was turned down. Eventually, the Nifty managed to close firmly tad below the 10100 mark on Friday.

“The kind of activity we are observing since last three days is quite obvious as traders seemed a bit unsure whether the market has that much strength to cross record highs or not. Hence, the next round of momentum in the upward direction is possible only after surpassing this hurdle,” Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst- Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.

“Until then we are likely to witness similar kind of uncertainty in a range of 10,000 – 10,138 with slightly higher volatility. A sustainable move below the 10,000 mark would apply brakes on the recent optimism,” he said.

At present, one needs to closely keep a track of these important levels on the index and meanwhile, keep focusing on individual stocks in order to obtain better trading opportunities.

Chavan further added that a prudent strategy would be to stay light on positions and should ideally be prepared with a proper exit strategy.

The RSI at 62 indicates a favorable buying regime coupled with continued uptrend momentum depicted by MACD at 52 above its Signal Line. Based on Fibonacci retracement a major support will be seen at 9807 and resistance level will be at 10137.

Here is a list of top 10 stocks which could give up to 10% return in short term:

Analyst: Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com

Rain Industries: BUY| Target Rs. 168 | Stop-loss Rs140 | Return 10%

Rain Industries witnessed a healthy correction this week on the backdrop of lower volume support but rebounded back towards the end of trading session on positive cues indicating an immediate uptrend.

On the weekly chart, it formed a bullish reversal candlestick pattern indicating a near-term uptrend movement after losing marginal points and continued bullish pattern on its long-term chart.

Further the momentum oscillator with RSI at 62 indicating strong support for current buying regime coupled with a continued crossover of MACD from its Signal-Line suggesting a strong support for uptrend momentum.

The stock is currently facing a resistance at 173 and support level at 139. We have a BUY recommendation for Rain Industries which is currently trading at Rs. 152.6

Indiabulls Ventures: BUY| Target Rs304 | Stop-loss Rs. 255 |Return 5%

Indiabulls Venture continued to trade at upper circuit despite losing marginal points during the last trading session. It continued with winning cycle on weekly basis forming a peak on intraday basis at 295-level over volume support but failed to sustain.

On the daily price chart, it formed a strong bullish candlestick pattern with the possibility of a breakout from current level given a positive correction in the last session.

On the technical front, the stock suggests a strong upward trend with retracement indicating a price trading above all the EMA level coupled MACD at 20.1 over its Signal-Line indicating a short-term rally at the regime.

The stock has a strong support at 251 level and it is facing a resistance from its 52-week high at 295, which is expected to breakout in short term. We have a BUY recommendation for Indiabulls Ventures which is currently trading at Rs. 279.6

Graphite India: BUY| Target Rs. 340 | Stop-loss Rs312 |Return 5%

After a muted moment in price and volume over a month period, Graphite India saw an upward reversal movement which contributed price to trade at all-time-high at Rs325-level. During the same session, it witnessed a decisive breakout on volume front.

Technically Graphite India is at uptrend with RSI indicating a price trading at uptrend momentum coupled with MACD breaking above its Signal-Line indicating a bullish crossover.

Similarly Moving Average analysis suggests a strong support for upward movement as price decisively breached its earlier peaks.

A major support level for the stock is seen at 305 while the resistance level will be tested at 365. We have a BUY recommendation for Graphite India which is currently trading at Rs. 325.05

Max Financial Services: BUY| Target Rs637 | Stop-loss Rs604 | Return 4%

Max Financial witnessed a considerable movement towards the weekend session despite a flat trading on the early week. It also witnessed a strong volume support over the same period which eased the price movement to trade at intraday high at Rs629 level.

On the daily chart, the stock formed a strong bullish candlestick pattern indicating the next lag of uptrend movement in the upcoming session. On the technical front, the RSI at 59.7 indicates a price being traded above its resistance level followed by bullish crossover just at the regime.

The stock is currently facing a resistance at 649 and support level at 601. We have a BUY recommendation for Max Financial which is currently trading at Rs. 615.75

Analyst: Pritesh Mehta of IIFL Private Wealth.

Tata Global Beverages: BUY| Target Rs 232| Stop Loss Rs204| Return 10%

We continue to reiterate our positive view on Tata Global Beverages. It has posted a rally of 3 percent in last week’s trade and we expect it to continue its recent momentum.

It is an up trending stock, which tends to go through a phase of consolidation after every up move. After being range bound at the top of its trend for the three weeks, the stock in the previous week finally staged a breakout.

A move prior to recent breakout could be termed as flag pattern. Flags are considered to be a continuation pattern in nature; we expect the stock to replicate the moment it had seen in early August.

Gann analysis suggests that the stock is in a strong uptrend and it also confirmed a shift in the orbit on the upside. Since it is an up trending stock, traders should always use any phase of consolidation and breakout from the same to build longs. Buy Tata Global above Rs212 with stop loss of Rs204 for a revised target of Rs232.

Britannia Industries: BUY| Target Rs4500| Stop Loss Rs4270| Return 3%

It has been consolidating at the top after a strong rally from June to August 2017. From last one month, it has been moving sideways between Rs4,340 and Rs4,180.

However, in recent phase of consolidation, the stock continues to find support around its 5-weekly EMA. On several occasions, it found support around the above-mentioned critical moving average.

In fact, the same is acting as a strong support since June 2017. Moreover, it continues to trade above the three-digit gann number of 431(0), implying strength in the recent sideways phase.

Since it is an up trending stock, traders should always use any phase of consolidation and also breakout from the same to build a long position.

A confirmation of a move above Rs4350 would result in an upside breakout and the stock could attempt Rs4,500 in the medium term. Based on above rationales, we recommend a buy on Britannia between Rs4320-4340 with SL of Rs4270 for a target of Rs4,500.

United Spirits: BUY| Target Rs2800| Stop Loss Rs2590| Return 6%

On the daily chart, the stock gave an upside breakout from a downward sloping trendline in this weeks’ trade. It suggests that the recent sideways corrective phase has ended and the trend is likely to reverse on the upside.

In the process, the stock also staged a breakout from multiple hurdle zone. It was facing resistance at 61.8% retracement of the entire move from Rs2774 to low of Rs2415. Also, the stock took support at its 10-weekly EMA post the corrective phase.

We believe a move above Rs2,650 with the expansion of volumes could see the stock touching the levels of Rs2,800 and above in the medium term. The short-term oscillators are also showing upward movement.

Keeping in mind above mentioned parameters, we recommend a buy on McDowell above Rs2,650 with a stop loss of Rs2,590 for a target of Rs2,800.

REC: BUY| Target Rs182| Stop Loss Rs163| Return 9%

It is a classic example of a stock which is going through a phase of bottoming out. It is a process, during which the stock tends to move in a narrow range doing virtually nothing. Similar such structure is seen in REC.

It took support at 50% retracement mark of the entire upmove seen from June 2016 high to May 2017 high. Thereafter, the stock has been gradually moving higher. In this week’s trade, it attempted a breakout from the consolidation phase at the bottom.

Sustenance above gann number of 169 would provide much-required ammo for the stock to surge higher. Based on above rationale, we recommend a buy on REC above Rs169 with a stop loss of Rs163 for a target of 182.

Power Grid: SELL| Target Rs 195| Stop Loss Rs215| Return 8%

Inability to sustain above gann number of 225 led to a strong reversal in the counter. Moreover, the stock has witnessed a breakdown of the structure of rising channel which corroborates our negative view on the stock.

In last week’s trade, it also fell below the point of the polarity of 213, which had acted as a base for a move towards Rs227. So, the recoveries if any are also likely to be short-lived.

Topping out pattern is clearly visible on multiple time frame which makes an ideal candidate for creating short positions. It has also confirmed a fall below the support of its 10-weekly EMA. Traders can short Power Grid Sep Futs below Rs209 with SL of Rs215 for a target of Rs195.

Analyst: Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst- Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking

Havells India: BUY| Target Rs 530| Stop Loss Rs493| Return 4%

The stock has been vacillating within the boundaries of two contracting trend lines since last three months. Last week, we saw a genuine attempt to traverse the upper range around 499 as the volume activity during this price development was quite encouraging.

Further, if we look at the momentum oscillators reading, the ‘RSI-Smoothened’ on the daily chart is continuing its upward trajectory by entering the overbought zone above the 70 mark. This we believe would provide the impetus for the up move.

Hence, we recommend buying this stock at current levels for a target of Rs.530 over the next 14 – 21 sessions. The stop loss now should be fixed at Rs.493.

Tata Motors: BUY| Target Rs420| Stop Loss Rs395| Return 4%

This stock has been a laggard since last few months. However, after forming a strong base around 375 for nearly four weeks, the stock has shown some encouraging sign in the latter half of the week.

A recent hurdle of 395 was thrashed with sizable volumes; indicating strong buying interest in the counter. The way momentum oscillators are shaped up; we expect the stock to extend this up move in the near term.

We recommend buying this stock for a target of Rs.420 over the next 5 – 10 sessions. The stop loss should be fixed at Rs.395.

Largecap stocks are playing catch-up after years of underperformance as the economy looks on strong footing, strong global as well as domestic flows, political stability, pro-growth reforms as well as attractive valuations.

“The Indian equity market witnessed a strong comeback towards the end of month backed by strong earnings report and favourable macro data. The major turn in the market comes from a large cap space where we witnessed a strong rally after a sluggish performance in past,” Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“With improved economic fundamentals favouring well-integrated companies in large cap segment coupled with improved business margin & innovative products at the edge, the large cap stock posted a strong performance,” he said.

Rohira further added that a concern over an increased valuation in mid & small cap stock prompted investors to behold with bellwether stock which also contributed to price movement.

Leading from the front was Reliance Industries which gained momentum soon after announcing its results for the quarter ended June 30. The oil & gas major reported 28 percent YoY growth in net profit to Rs9,108 crore and recorded beat on most parameters.

Reliance Industries rallied nearly 17 percent, followed by SBI which rose 14 percent, Wipro gained 11 percent, HDFC added 10.5 percent, and Bharti Airtel rose 10.1 percent in the month of July.

“Large cap stocks like Reliance, ITC, HDFC, DLF IndusInd Bank and L&T have still left room for upside,” Abnish Kumar Sudhanshu, Technical Analyst, Aadya Commodities Pvt. Ltd told Moneycontrol.

Among the index companies, Infosys, HDFC Bank, ONGC, Maruti Suzuki were not far behind and made their presence felt last month.

In July, India caught up on its performance compared to its global indices. The MSCI India was up 7.4 percent, outperforming MSCI EM by 2ppt.

On a YoY basis, India continues to underperform MSCI EM and BRIC indices even as India is now outperforming the MSCI DM index.

Sensex's month on month performance was the best since Mar-16. Further, Sensex outperformed small and mid-cap indices during the month even as Sensex has underperformed the broader indices on YTD and YoY basis, Morgan Stanley said in a note.

Market breadth rose with 82% of the stocks trading above their 200DMA. The monthly derivative turnover rose to a new life high and monthly cash volumes rose to its second highest level in history (first being in June-09), it said.

Largecap stocks have mostly underperformed small and midcap peers but July stood out as a strong month in which the tables reversed in favour of the big names.

However, the large part of the rally came from financials, especially from private sector banks, which rose in anticipation of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and strong June quarter results.

Largecaps do give valuations comfort but growth comfort still lies with small and midcap names, suggest experts.

“We must understand that large cap outperformance has largely been anchored by financials which have higher weightage in the index. Moreover, as the earnings season progressed, most of the large cap have witnessed improved profitability and hence the positive reaction to stock prices,” Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICI Direct told Moneycontrol.

“At the current levels, on a broad base, while large caps offer valuations comfort, midcaps provide growth comfort. We note growth comfort continues to be preferred both domestically and globally,” he said.

He further added that investors need to be market cap agnostic and prefer capital efficient business models with healthy growth visibility going forward."

A break above 9,700 and renewed buying interest in Bank Nifty has brushed aside the concerns of June’s steep fall from the peak 9,699.

The market’s focus has turned holistic with midcap and smallcap staging rallies of 6 and 7 percent, respectively from their recent lows. Both indices are trading below the May 2017 peak.

Within these spaces, majority of stocks are showing signs of fresh breakout and follow-up buying. The stock-specific action based on spotting pockets of strength is hence an ideal approach in the current scenario.

The market is now clearly momentum-driven. When such a market assumes center stage, focusing on upside targets is not advisable. The uptrend could either travel more than anticipated or could witness abrupt supply pressure at higher levels (which is not ruled out).

However, till correction happens; or telltale signs of exhaustion become visible, traders can gainfully ride the current up move.

Top five stocks which can give up to 7-8% upside in short term:

Power Grid: BUY | Target: Rs230 | Stop Loss: Rs208 | Return: 7%

Forming series of higher high and higher low, the stock has been trading in a secular uptrend. During the corrective decline, the stock has a tendency of taking support near its 21-week EMA levels. The Bulls outstripped bears near this EMA to keep overall

price structure healthy.

The recent price structure shows positive breakout at an uncharted zone which indicates a resumption of the prevailing uptrend.

The RSI on the daily chart surpassed previous peak levels, thereby confirming momentum on the upside. Based on above-mentioned parameters, we recommend a buy on Power Grid above Rs215 with a stop loss of Rs208 and a target of Rs230

Biocon: BUY| Target Rs391| Stop Loss Rs352| Return 7%

The positive breakout from the consolidation phase after a sharp decline suggests exhaustion of selling pressure and renewed buying interest. Back in April 2017, it had made a peak of Rs402 and went through a sharp correction, unable to sustain above the

midpoint of gann channel.

However, it took support at its 48-weekly EMA and began a process of consolidation. This critical support is in place since 2016, thereby providing opportunities to buy on every decline.

Improved relative strength following a phase of base-building at the bottom warrants positive outlook for the stock.

The pattern of consecutive higher highs and higher lows on the weekly time frame above the midpoint of current gann channel suggests a reversal.

Keeping in mind, above mentioned parameters, we recommend a buy on Biocon above Rs365 with a stop loss of Rs352 and a target of Rs391.

GRUH Finance: BUY| Target Rs550| Stop Loss Rs493| Return 8%

The steady move above most of the important averages has ensured bullish price setup on long term charts. The stock has been consistently outperforming to a broader market by charting into the uncharted zone.

The recent price structure shows series of higher high and higher low chart pattern and positive break out of ‘Flag’ chart formation.

The rally from Rs480 levels was accompanied by comparatively higher volumes; hence, based on above-mentioned observations, we recommend a buy on GRUH above Rs508 with a stop loss of Rs493 and a target of Rs550

Indiabulls Housing Finance: BUY| Target Rs1204| Stop Loss Rs1086| Return 7%

The sustenance above the long-term averages and series of rising high indicates healthy long term structure. Recently, the stock had experienced 12 percent correction from its all-time high of Rs1,187; however, forming base near Rs1,050 renewed buying interest emerged to keep overall outlook positive.

Moreover, the second line of defense as per gann rule of 8 provided respite to the stock which was followed by breakout past the descending trend line.

Important support is now emerging at Rs 1,090. Based on above observations we recommend a buy on Indiabulls Housing Finance above Rs 1,125 with a stop loss of Rs 1,086 and a target of Rs 1,204.

Capital First: BUY| Target Rs803| Stop Loss Rs724| Return 7%

Forming multiple lows near Rs650 in the past few months, the stock prices managed to defend its March’2017 low of Rs627.

Recently, it broke above the downward slanting trendline, also it managed to surpass upper boundaries of the recent consolidation phase.

With the appearance of the bullish bodied candle on comparatively higher volumes, important support is now placed at Rs330. Sustaining above for the same could keep near-term outlook positive.

Based on above observations we recommend a buy on Capital First above Rs750 with a stop loss of Rs724 and a target of Rs803.

Amit Gupta of ICICIdirect told CNBC-TV18, ""The underperforming stocks have started seeing the short closer in them. In the last few series, we were seeing that the short positions were getting rolled. Now particularly in NTPC and stocks like Bajaj Auto, we were seeing that these short positions were getting rolled. Now what we are observing is that the short closer has already started, could be because of this P-notes news which has recently come in and they have to unwind the positions possibly by the July expiry.""

""In NTPC, the Rs 155-160 range for the last five or six months, even though Nifty had seen some intermediate declines, remained in that range. I understand the fact that it did not move up but the delivery pickup recently around Rs 155-158 has been really encouraging and the Call writers so far which were very active, they have already started closing their positions. Now this activity was there at 160 Call. It has already closed above that level,"" he said.

""So, my sense is some momentum the stock can pick up and because the implied volatility (IV) is very low, that is where the premiums in NTPC Call options are still very low. So, it is an opportunity to buy the Call options of this stock for this particular series and that is why we are buying 165 Call options which is somewhere around Rs 1.8-2. So, you buy this, look for a target of Rs 6 in this particular expiry. So that is where we are buying the underperforming stocks by buying the Call options,"" he added.

""In the power space Power Grid is one stock which has remained near the life highs. However, now we have already seen that in 4-5 months Power Gird has remained near Rs 200-210 levels. The peculiar nature of the stock gives good volume setup and then it consolidates above that level. So, that happened at Rs 200 and that is now happening at Rs 210. My gut feeling is, the stock is likely to move towards Rs 224-226 kind of levels very soon.""

""Looking at the futures positions where at these levels people try to go short, now they are unwinding their positions. Already we have seen 25 percent of short closer in this when it moved from Rs 208 to Rs 211-212 levels. So, I think the particular closer of positions in future segment can give some momentum to this stock also and it can move higher."""

The 20-DMA is proving a strong support level for the Nifty while during Monday’ session relative strength index (RSI) has also generated fresh buying signals along with increasing volumes.

The market ended at a high of six days and attracting new buyers into the market. Levels of 9,550 will remain a very strong support to the downside where only a close below could bring more selling pressure.

A trend reversal can be expected thereafter but it seems that bulls are taking gradual control of the market here. The level of 9,700-9,720 will be the immediate resistance above which uptrend would confirm and the market will remain upside for over short to medium term.

Top five stocks to buy for intraday trade which can give up to 3% return:

Vedanta: BUY| Target Rs250| Stop Loss Rs237| Return 3%

The 20-DMA has proven a strong support level for the stock in the recent few sessions along with that the counter managed to close well above 50-DMA in Monday’s session. The bullish candle on the daily chart and crossover in RSI and MACD are supporting more upside is highly likely for the stock.

The short-to-medium term indicators along with Parabilic SAR which indicates medium-term movement are in favour of stock to move further higher.

Asian Paints: BUY| Target Rs1170| Stop Loss Rs1138| Return 1%

The chart has gained momentum during the intraday session on Monday and closed with a positive candle on the daily chart.

Tata Steel: BUY| Target Rs538| Stop Loss Rs510| Return 3%

The stock has witnessed gap up opening on Monday’s trading session attracting more buyers and maintained its uptrend throughout the session.

A fresh upside breakout has seen on the daily charts which is likely to remain intact over short to medium term.

It is time to be stock specific, maybe that’s the approach mutual fund managers are taking right now at a time when the market trades near record highs. The Nifty50 which has come off slightly from its record high but has gained over 17 percent so far in the year 2017.

Fund managers remained selective when they shopped for stocks in the month of May. They remained net buyers in 65 percent of the Nifty50 stocks, Motilal Oswal said in a report.

Stocks in which funds have more than 2 percent stake include names like Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, Power Grid, Infosys, TCS, L&T, State Bank of India, ITC, M&M, ICICI Bank, Eicher Motors etc. among others.

Among the Nifty50 names, highest net buying in the month of May on a month-on-month (MoM) basis was witnessed in Vedanta (up 27 percent), Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 17 percent) and Tech Mahindra (up 17 percent).

The Equity asset under management (AUM) rose for the sixth consecutive month in May to scale a new high of Rs 5.2 trillion, highlighted the report.

In the month of May, MFs showed interest in private banks, metals, consumer, technology, auto and infrastructure — these sectors saw a MoM increase in weights.

Among the Nifty50 names, top conviction buys include names like HDFC Bank where almost 19 funds have more than 2 percent exposure, followed by ICICI Bank with 16 funds having an exposure of 2 percent and 12 funds have exposure to State Bank of India.

Almost 5 funds have exposure in both Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC while 4 funds have exposure in Yes Bank and 3 funds have holdings in Axis Bank.

Rate sensitive stocks have been fund managers’ darling in the last few months especially private sector banks. Private Banks sectoral weight rose 17.3 percent which as the top sector holding in May, followed by Auto (10.7 percent), Capital Goods (8.7 percent) and NBFC (7 percent).

“Since banks are a play on the economy, they can sustain earnings growth for a long time. Particularly, ICICI Bank is attractively valued while HDFC and Kotak are high-quality stocks that have a track record of delivering superior returns,” Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

Among the IT or technology sector names Infosys remained in the spotlight. Despite global headwinds which have contracted margin for some of the top IT companies, almost 11 funds have holdings of more than 2 percent in Infosys while for TCS it is just 1 fund.

Mutual funds are betting on stocks which have good earnings visibility are stocks from sectors like IT and pharma which are facing some headwinds are valued very low.

Some quality names in both these segments are available at attractive valuations which are attracting smart money into these stocks.

“Clarity from Managements of IT majors on underperformance has helped to rope in some Bargain Hunters into the sector,” Rajesh Shanbhag, Advisory Head – Alternate Channels, Way2Wealth Brokers Pvt. Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“However, Indian Prime Minister’s meet with US President which is scheduled for this month-end will be closely watched where the H1 B VISA issue is to be addressed,” he said."

The Nifty started the week on a negative note after forming spinning top candle formation last week. We have witnessed Nifty is trading in downward channel pattern on lower time frame by forming lower low formation, any break above 9650 levels will take Nifty towards 9700 levels which is a strong resistance point for the market while breaking below 9580 may drag Nifty towards 9530-9480 levels.

Derivative data indicate 9700 CE and 9500 PE still holding highest open interest suggesting index will trade in the same range.

Markets are trading in a tight range of 9,580-9,710 and breaking on either side will decide final move. Any dip towards 9,530 levels will be good buying opportunity while breaking above 9,710 levels will lead in strong short covering.

Here is a list of five stocks which can give up to 13% return in short term:

Adani Enterprises: BUY | Target Rs 150 | Stop Loss Rs 124 | Upside 13%

The stock has shown a quick up and down moment in the month of April and after correcting from higher levels, the stock went into to a consolidation phase.

Last week, the stock has given a decisive breakout above its consolidation phase with strong volume and closed above the Rs127 zone. Currently, the stock is not breaking its breakout levels which suggest stock has the strength to move towards its previous high.

For the trading purpose, we recommend a buy on the stock at current levels for the target of Rs150 in the near term with keeping stop out below Rs124 on a closing basis.

KPIT: BUY| Target Rs 131 | Stop Loss Rs 119 | Upside 6%

The stock rose consistently for the last five sessions giving higher closing every time with strong pickup in volume activity.

If we look at the daily chart we witnessed stock is trading in positive divergence along with it stock has able to close on its strong resistance of 121 which will now act as strong support for coming sessions.

On weekly chart stock has formed two hammer candle kind of formation which represents a reversal. We expect prices to bounce up to Rs131 levels on an immediate basis and for this trade one needs to maintain a stop loss below Rs119.

Power Grid: BUY| Target Rs 230| Stop Loss Rs 201 | Upside 9%

The stock is consolidating since long and Tuesday session stock has given volume breakout & given closing at 210 levels.

On the downside, Rs204-201 is 50 EMA & 100 DMA which will act as strong support for the stock. On the flip side, the stock has the strong resistance near Rs214 levels and any closing above the Rs214 levels can take stock towards Rs230 levels in the near-term.

We recommend traders to buy Power Grid at current levels for the target of Rs230 keeping a stop loss levels below Rs201 on a closing basis.

CIPLA: SELL | Target Rs 515 | Stop Loss Rs 556 | Return 5%

Cipla overall structure still looks weak and on Wednesday session stock closed more than two percent down.

Cipla has touched 50 EMA and we witnessed selling pressure from those levels, on Wednesday session stock closed below strong support of 543 suggesting more weakness.

On weekly chart 200 DMA is reading at 550 levels which will act as strong resistance as of now. We expect prices to dip further from current levels up to Rs515, one need to keep a stop loss above Rs556 on a closing basis.

Manappuram Finance: BUY| Target Rs 106| Stop Loss Rs 91| Upside 12%

Recently, the stock has corrected from its high & ended its correction near to 50% retracement zone of previous low of Sep 2015. If we look at monthly chart stock forming reversal pattern after correcting, which is suggesting some upside moment in near term.

On Wednesday session stock rose after taking support from 100 DMA & 50 EMA, on immediate basis stock has a resistance near Rs96. Breaking above Rs96 we may see a quick move towards Rs103 levels.

One can initiate a buy call on stock for the target of Rs106 with keeping a stop loss below Rs91 on closing basis.

The market continued its upside momentum in Monday’s trading session to touch another milestone of an all-time high of 9,637.75. The benchmark Sensex also recorded fresh all-time high of 31,214.

Although, the market gained upside momentum but failed to hold on its gains on the upper edge and witnessed some selling pressure twice when the market reached on top leaving behind a spinning top candle formation on the Nifty daily charts.

The immediate support zone for the coming session is placed at 9,565-9,570 and if the index sustains below these level for long would activate bears in the market.

Top five stocks which can give up to 5 percent return in this week:

UPL: BUY| Target Rs875| Stop Loss Rs815| Return 3.5%

The stock rose for the third consecutive session on Monday and witnessed a very strong closing above its immediate resistance above Rs842. The next trading session will likely to attract some more upside as the counter is gaining strength from the rising momentum indicators e.g. RSI and MACD both.

HDFC: BUY| Target Rs1,655| Stop Loss Rs1,560| Return 3%

The stock has attracted buying momentum during Monday’s session and closed at Rs1,598 with high volumes which is above its immediate resistance of Rs1,592.

The counter is expected to continue its upward rally in the coming sessions as the momentum indicator MACD is generating fresh buying signal on the daily charts.

BPCL: BUY| Target Rs788| Stop Loss Rs741| Return 4%

The stock is headed northwards for the fifth consecutive session where buying was very well supported by rising volumes along with 20-DMA and fresh MACD crossover.

The candle formation on the daily charts is still convincing and is hinting towards more upside to come in the coming session.

Tata Communications: BUY| Target Rs 740| Stop Loss Rs688| Return 4.9%

The counter witnessed heavy buying volumes in Monday’s session as it crossed above its 20- DMA during the intraday trades and touched 50-DMA during the same session.

The stock gained on the back of strong buying momentum which was supported by 200-DMA on the daily charts since past couple of sessions and closed slightly higher than Rs705 which is above its immediate resistance of Rs693.

Power Grid: BUY| Target Rs 221| Stop Loss Rs203| Return 5.7%

The stock has now started moving on the higher side since the last two sessions, suggesting some more positive momentum to come in the next session as the counter has crossed above 20 DMA during intraday and even marked its closing above those levels.

The stock is likely to attract some more northwards movement in the coming session and more upside is expected over short-term.

Experts feel the government wants to clean this NPA mess as early as possible.

""Meetings with senior bureaucrats and industry experts give us confidence that the government is serious about resolving the NPL mess. A few cases might be resolved in the next 2-3 months itself,"" Mahesh Nandurkar of CLSA said.

He further said the common scepticism is that several government/RBI attempts in the past haven't worked out. But this time the back is against the wall and if a resolution is not found soon enough, both the banks and the government will have to pay a financial price in FY18 itself, he feels.

A resolution would be positive for corporate banks in general and PSU banks in particular, Nandurkar believes.

In addition, ""We were assured that 'Housing for all' remains a key focus area for the government and its funding will not be a constraint, especially for the 'housing loan subsidy' component,"" he said.

Central transmission utility Power Grid today said it has put sufficient firewalls to deal with the global cyber attack Ramsomware and consumers need not fear sudden outages on that account.

Power Grid's top brass deliberated on the strategy to deal with the Ransomware, a malicious software that infects computers and restricts user access until ransom is paid for unlocking them.

""Since the Power Grid operations are information technology based, the issue was discussed in detail at a meeting of board members chaired by Chairman and Managing Director I S Jha this morning,"" a senior official said.

The official said instructions have already been issued to the employees not to open certain mails or download material which can infect our system.

""There are reports that it has affected certain sectors like banks. But in our case we have put sufficient firewalls to deal with the situation to protect our system,"" he said.

Earlier, the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology had said that multiple cases of WannaCry/WannaCrypt ransomware infections in many countries around the world have been reported recently.

It said: ""In India, no reports have been formally received so far regarding this Ransomware attack. However, it is understood that a few systems of the Police Department in Andhra Pradesh were impacted. The ministry has informed Andhra Pradesh Government, to follow the CERT-In advisory.""

Meanwhile, European and British policing and security agencies have warned that the fallout from an unprecedented global cyberattack which has hit more than 200,000 victims could worsen as people return to work.

An international manhunt was under way for the plotters behind the world's biggest-ever computer ransom assault which has affected more than 150 countries.

The virus exploits a flaw in a version of Microsoft Windows first identified by US intelligence.

The attacks exploited the computers because they were running outdated versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system."

The Nifty has been consolidating in a narrow range post expiry. Overall derivative data indicates long rollover and most of the Nifty futures positions has been rolled with the average of 9,320 futures.

Derivative data indicates bullish scenario to continue after some consolidation. The Nifty has multiple strong supports at lower levels followed by 9,250, 9,200, 9,170, and 9,100.

In the May option contracts, we are seeing options open interest is building up in 9,500 calls and 9,000 puts, so the probable range for current expiry could be 9000-9500 with upwards bias.

On the technical front, 9,200-9,250 spot levels are strong support zone and the current trend is likely to continue towards 9,450-9,500.

The stock has been trading around its higher end of the range from the last two years. In recent past, pull back in prices has been seen from Rs208 levels and has taken support at its 100-days EMA around 190 levels and also well maintained above it.

In the past few sessions, upside breakout in prices has been witnessed above 200 levels.

Traders can accumulate the stock in range of 205-210 for the upside target of 228 with stop loss below 193

Titagarh Wagons: BUY| Target Rs 145| Stop Loss Rs 115| Upside 16%

A decent rally in prices has been seen from lower levels in the stock from 100 to 125 levels. In the past few sessions, a sudden rise in volumes along with the rise in price has taken stock towards 130 levels.

In current scenario cup & handle pattern has formed on the daily charts which is generally bullish in nature. On weekly charts as well prices are on verge of giving breakout above 130 levels.

Traders can accumulate the stock in a range of Rs125-130 for the upside target of Rs145 with a stop loss below Rs115.

Britannia Industries: BUY| Target Rs 4,000| Stop Loss Rs 3,300| Upside 12%

The stock has made a double bottom pattern around 3100 levels on the daily charts and from there on bounced sharply towards 3400 levels in very short span of time.

Since then, the stock went into consolidation and traded in a very thin range of Rs 3,350-3,450 levels. However, last week, the stock has given consolidation breakout above its resistance levels of Rs3450 along with positive divergence in oscillators and once again seems to have resumed its uptrend.

The prices are well trading above its long and short term moving averages which provide rock solid support to prices going forward. Traders can accumulate the stock in a range of Rs 3,550-3,600 for the upside target of Rs 4,000 with a stop loss below Rs3,300.

City Union Bank: BUY| Target Rs 185| Stop Loss Rs 150| Upside 15%

The short and long term moving averages on both the daily and weekly charts are also well supporting the prices indicating strength in the counter. Moreover, a sudden rise in volumes along with the rise in prices last week furthermore point towards bullish momentum to remain intact in coming sessions.

Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved USD 175 million loan to Power Grid Corporation to expand its solar energy transmission network in the country.

The project funding will improve the capacity and efficiency of interstate transmission networks, particularly in transmitting the electricity generated from new solar parks to the national grid, an ADB statement said.

ADB said as part of the assistance, it will also provide a USD 50 million co-financing loan from Clean Technology Fund -a USD 5.8 billion component of the Climate Investment Funds.

The Climate Investment Fund is aimed at providing developing countries resources to expand efforts in utilising low carbon technologies and transitioning to clean, renewable energy sources.

ADB said the solar transmission sector project is also the first project to be implemented following usage of agency level country safeguards and procurement systems for Power Grid to speed up processes. It will also provide autonomy and ownership of the project.

""India, with its mandate of achieving a more sustainable future, is leading the lines in achieving energy security while increasing energy capacity and supply through renewable sources such as solar energy,"" said Kaoru Ogino, an ADB Principal Energy Specialist.

Asian shares rebounded and the dollar firmed after global markets made a remarkable comeback from the shock of Republican Donald Trump's presidential victory, dumping safe-havens for the tempting returns of risk assets. Analysts were more than a little puzzled by the sharp reversal after global markets plunged initially on Wednesday as Trump swept to power. The Nikkei duly recouped all of Wednesday's 5 percent loss and more to trade up 6 percent.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.7 percent, while Australian stocks soared 3 percent in the largest daily gain since late 2011.Back home, on Dalal Street the frontline indices recovered towards the end of trade.

Sun Pharma's second quarter profit is seen rising 52.3 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,685 crore on strong operational performance.

According to analysts polled by CNBC-TV18, revenue may increase 13.7 percent to Rs 7,772.8 crore year-on-year, led by US sales.

Operating profit may grow 28.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,487 crore and margin may expand 370 basis points to 32 percent.

The US dollar rose broadly against its major rivals post Trump's victory. The Mexican peso plunged to record lows, losing 7.8 percent to trade at 19.79 to the dollar.

PWGR has strong visibility of earnings growth and is the best among regulated businesses. While NTPC and NHPC have to maintain both PLF and PAF, PWGR has to maintain only PAF.

"September 06, 2014 04:33 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/weekly-wrap-sensex-gains-15-broader-markets-ruleroost-1314923.html,"Better-than-expected macroeconomic numbers and global cues proved a good concoction for the markets this week.

Q1 GDP numbers released late Friday last week boosted benchmark stock indices to historically high levels on Monday. A European style stimulus is also on the cards, declared ECB President Mario Draghi on Thursday. The move can prove beneficial to emerging markets such as India, point out analysts.

Both Sensex and Nifty surged between 1.5 percent and 1.7percent, rising in 3 out of 5 trading sessions this week. Broader markets witnessed major action this week; BSE small-cap and mid-cap indices spiked 3.4-3.5 percent, significantly outperforming the benchmarks' 1.5-1.7 percent bump. From the mid-cap space, Gammon India, Shalimar Paints, HFCL swelled 31-32 percent; Suven Life, MTNL , UPL and Apollo Tyres shot up between 17 percent and 27 percent.

Among blue-chips, NMDC, Bharti Airtel and Cipla were gained 8.4-9.6 percent; Hero MotoCorp , L&T, UltraTech ,Tech Mahindra, Grasim and Axis Bank surged between 4 percent and 6 percent.

According to Vibhav Kapoor, Group Chief Investment Officer, IL&FS, Nifty could touch 9000 by March. Kapoor said global equities appear comfortable and a potential hike in interest rates by US Federal Reserve would not affect liquidity flows to emerging market.

The week hummed with a 'NaMo' chant after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his visit to Japan managed to secure a commitment from Japan to invest USD 35 billion in private and public investments in India over the next five years.

The week also saw the deferral of SC judgment on the fate of coal blocks allocation to September 9. Last week, SC had held the allocation of coal blocks since 1993 was illegal. The move caused jitters in the power & mining stocks.

Macroeconomic booster

The economy expanded at its fastest pace in two years at 5.7 percent in the April-June period, up from previous quarter's 4.6 percent growth and 4.7 percent a year earlier.

But experts are convinced that the first quarter's euphoria may not be repeated in later quarters.

""The jump in June growth partly reflects deferral of public expenditure to the June quarter from March to show a lower-than-targeted 4.6percent FY14 fiscal deficit. As a result, social services jumped 9.1percent in the June quarter from 3.3percent in March. Had social services grown at, say, 6percent in the two quarters, growth would have worked out to a more comparable 5.3percent for June and 4.9percent for March,"" said BoFA BofA Merrill Lynch report.

Also, current account deficit (CAD) for the first quarter of FY15 contracted to 1.7 percent of GDP at $7.8bn down sharply from 4.8percent or $21.8bn in the same quarter last year.

Euro Trip: Second innings of loose liquidity?

A European style quantitative easing is also on the cards, declared ECB President Mario Draghi. ECB also its benchmark interest rates by 10bps to 0.05 percent.

The ECB announced a program to buy 'simple and transparent asset-backed securities and covered bonds starting in October.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Nick Parsons, Head of Research, UK & Europe at National Australia Bank said he expects emerging markets to be the unintended beneficiaries of the ECB rate cut.

""I think its supportive for credit market, it is supportive for assets more generally and although its giving quite a big boost to the US dollar, we can see that through the performance of the dollar index spot (DXY), the EM is able to be resilient in the face of US dollar and it is helpful for risk assets more generally. How long that period of this being supportive, remains to be seen because at some point we will be looking forward to the FOMC’s next meeting on September 17, but for the moment it is supportive and would be beneficiary of it,"" said Parsons.

Autos Vroom

A growth in auto sales numbers, a proxy for consumer demand, also bolstered the prospects for automobile companies ahead of the festive season.

Nine of the country’s top automobile manufacturers collectively sold 200,174 units in August as compared to 169,809 units sold in the same month last year.

Ajay shethiyas of Centrum Broking says, ""Passenger vehicle industry seen positive growth after 17 mths of decline. Festive period stocking has taken place early. Dealers suggesting major pick up ahead of Shraadh period this year. Shraadh period from 9th Sep– 23rd Sep this year , thus pre- buying seen before shraadh. Dealers indicate signs of recovery visible in MHCV space. Discounts in MHCV space has stabilized. A Strong recovery expected in CV cycle in H2FY15.""

Maruti sold 1,10,776 units in the passenger vehicles segment, up 26.9 percent compared to 87,323 units in the same month last year. This was largely on account of robust sales in the domestically, which increased 29.3 percent to 98,304 units while exports were up a more modest 10.5 percent to 12,472. The stock surged 3.6percent this week.

Telecom super regulator

The buzz about TRAI getting replaced by a super regulator generated good returns for telecom stocks this week. Bharti Airtel surged 8.5 percent and fared among the top Nifty gainers this week. The proposed regulator will be called 'Communications Commission', and might replace Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), sources told CNBC-TV18.

The new body will retain the functions and the powers of TRAI but will additional say in affairs of some other regulators such as the Censor Board, clearances given by Competition Commission of India (CCI), Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and the Environment Ministry.

Movers & Shakers

The week put the the erstwile king of good times -Vijay Mallaya- was back in focus. He along with three other associates of UB group were decalared 'wilful defaulters' by United Bank of India (UBI).

The move followed after Mallya and his associates didn't turn up for a meeting at the grievance redressal cell of the United bank of India. Mallya's grounded Kingfisher Airlines owes about Rs 350 crore to the bank.

The law requires that all access to further bank funding be cut to willful defaulters and also the companies where they serve as directors.

Also, USL stock (down 4.8percent) got hammered to the dumps later in the week after the company reported a net loss of Rs Rs 5380 crore for the March quarter, due to write-offs and provisions. USL holdings stock slumped 14percent this week.

Brokerages CLSA and CIMB downgraded the stock following the pogrom.

""While we believe taking all these provisions in one swoop is prudent and a right step towards cleaning up its balance sheet, we cannot completely rule out further provisions as investigations are still ongoing. We cut our FY15-FY16 EPS forecasts by 24-27 percent to reflect slower operational improvement and higher outstanding debt post W&M sale. We roll over to September 2015 target price of Rs2,230. Risk-reward is not attractive enough as current valuations already factor in a strong recovery,"" said CIMB in a note"
"January 02, 2014 10:10 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/sensex-closes-below-21000-down-252-pts-banks-fmcg-drag-1336159.html,"Moneycontrol Bureau

After consolidating for the past seven sessions, the market has seen sharp breakout on the lower side on Thursday with the equity benchmarks sliding more than a percent in last hour of trade. However, it was up nearly a percent in morning session.

The Sensex closed below the 21000 level for the first time in last nine sessions, falling 252.15 points or 1.19 percent to 20,888.33. The index lost nearly 450 points from day’s high. The Nifty fell 80.50 points or 1.28 percent to 6,221.15.

The broader markets too took a knock after gaining momentum since last week. The BSE Midcap declined 1.77 percent and Smallcap slipped 2 percent. Declining shares outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of 1551 to 1025 on the BSE.

Profit booking, unwinding of long positions and build-up of shorts in major sectors like banks, capital goods, oil & gas and FMCG ahead of earnings season may have caused selling pressure, feel experts. Infosys and IndusInd Bank will kick off the December ended quarter earnings season on January 10.

“There has been a big built up of long position towards the end of the year. Even during last expiry season lot of it got rolled over. Part of it people are booking profits in some of them and some people are expressing outright short because there is a view that there is a big bubble built up and that could break out,” Gopi Suvanam, founder of InvestWorks said.

Fall in global markets and depreciation in rupee too may have dented sentiment. China’s Shanghai Composite dipped 0.3 percent after lower than expected manufacturing PMI. Kospi dropped more than 2 percent while European markets were trading lower between 0.5-1 percent (at 16:15 hours IST).

Meanwhile, the rupee closed at 62.26 against the US dollar, down 36 paise compared to previous day's closing value.

HSBC's India manufacturing purchasing manager’s index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in December as against 51.3 in November due to deceleration in domestic orders. The weakness in orders was driven by softer domestic demand given that new export orders improved, HSBC in its report said.

Stocks in action

BSE Realty and Capital Goods indices were down 3 percent each while Power, Bank, FMCG, Oil and Gas, and Metal declined between 1.5-2 percent.

Larsen and Toubro, BHEL, Bharti Airtel and Tata Power were top losers in the Sensex, sliding around 3 percent.

Banks were stars from the beginning of trade today, but in last hour of trade, these stocks got butchered. Country’s largest private sector lender ICICI Bank lost 3 percent while its rivals State Bank of India, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank fell more than a percent.

Among others, Reliance Industries, ONGC, ITC and Hindustan Unilever were down 1.5-2 percent.

Coal India plunged 3 percent after its December dispatch stood to 42.8 million tonne that is lower compared to target of 43.5 million tonne and even output was at 44.5 mt as against target of 45 mt.

However, TCS, Infosys, Sun Pharma and Maruti Suzuki bucked the trend with marginal gains.

Power Grid Corporation of India rose 2.4 percent to Rs 101.90 apiece as the company said southern grid has been connected to national grid after commissioning of Raichur-Solapur transmission line.

In the broader space, IL&FS Engineering and Construction Company rose 4.55 percent to Rs 48.30 apiece after getting letter of award for Rs 112.05 crore buildings work in Faridabad.

Ricoh India was locked at 5 percent upper circuit at Rs 137.25 after the company fixed indicative price for delisting at Rs 120/share.

Sangam India surged 8 percent to Rs 40.95 apiece after a block deal of 16.3 lakh shares or 4.15 percent equity.

Sandur Manganese was down 5.6 percent to Rs 586.40 as the Bangalore-based company suspended mining operations from January 1 2014 after mining lease expired on December 31, 2013."

""The issue opens on December 3 and closes on December 5 for institutional investors and December 6 for retail category of investors and employees,"" an official statement said.

The price band for the issue has been fixed at Rs 85-90 a share, PGCIL said in a filing to the BSE. Shares of PGCIL closed at Rs 95.05, up 0.69 percent on the BSE. The sale of 78.70 crore shares could fetch around Rs 7,083 crore at the upper end of the price band.

The company may garner close to Rs 5,717 crore, while the government will get around Rs 1,758 crore.

The Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) on disinvestment, headed by Finance Minister P Chidambaram, today decided on the date and pricing for the FPO of the state-owned PGCIL.

Earlier this month, the Cabinet had cleared the FPO of PGCIL, which will comprise 13 percent fresh equity by the company and 4 percent stake sale by the central government.

The government will sell 18.51 crore shares in PGCIL, while the company will issue fresh 60.18 crore shares through the offer. Of the fresh shares, about 2.4 percent will be reserved for the employees.

50 percent of the net issue is allocated to Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs), 35 percent for retail category and 15 percent for High Network Investors (HNI). Above 0.38 percent of the issue is reserved for employees.

Retail category and employees shall be given a discount of 5 percent on the issue price.

The government holding in the company will come down to 57.89 percent from the present level of 69.42 percent.

Citigroup, ICICI Securities, UBS, SBI Caps and Kotak Mahindra have been appointed as merchant bankers for the FPO. This will be the second follow-on offering from PGCIL, which sold a 10 percent stake along with a similar stake divested by the government in November 2010 at an issue price of Rs 90 a share.

The company hit the capital market with initial public offering in October 2007.

So far in the current fiscal, the government has raised over Rs 1,300 crore through minority stake sale in PSUs. It has set a target of Rs 40,000 crore from disinvestment in current fiscal."

State-owned Power Grid, which will soon hit the market with a follow-on public offer, will seek shareholders' approval to hike shareholding limit for FIIs in the company to 30 percent from existing 24 percent.

Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd has said that increasing the limit would provide more headroom for investments by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in the company.In the postal ballot notice sent to shareholders, the utility has said that present holding of FIIs in the company is about 16 per cent of paid up capital. FIIs holding has been on the rise since the company's FPO in 2010.To ""make more headroom for FIIs"", it is proposed to increase their shareholding limit in the company to 30 percent from 24 per cent of the paid up capital, according to Power Grid.Further, the firm has said that increasing the limit would also enable FIIs to acquire shares within the proposed limit of 30 per cent of paid-up capital under the portfolio investment scheme of the Reserve Bank of India.Besides, the company has sought approval from shareholders to increase borrowing limits to Rs 1,30,000 crore from current cap of Rs 1,00,000 crore.Both proposals were approved by Power Grid's board of directors during their meeting held on October 23.Meanwhile, the central transmission utility, which is expected to come out next month with its FPO, would see issue of 13 per cent fresh equity besides government selling four per cent stake in the offering.The company would issue fresh 60.18 crore shares while the government would sell 18.51 crore scrips through the FPO, which was cleared by the Cabinet earlier this month. Power Grid came out with its initial public offering in October 2007."

Hiving off electricity grids operator POSOCO into a separate company is likely to take some more time with the Power Ministry yet to complete inter-ministerial consultations on the proposal.

Power System Operation Corporation (POSOCO), which ensures integrated functioning of regional and national electricity systems, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of state-run Power Grid Corp The move to make POSOCO a separate entity comes at a time when more private players are getting into power transmission segment.The Power Ministry has floated a draft Cabinet note on the proposal and comments have not come from all the Ministries. Once the inter-ministerial consultations are complete, the Ministry would put it up for Cabinet approval, a senior official said.Earlier, the Department of Public Enterprises had reservations about various aspects, including salary structure of a separate POSOCO. The concerns were sorted out by the Power Ministry before moving the draft Cabinet note.Voices for making POSOCO an independent regulator gained momentum especially after the unprecedented collapse of electricity grids last year that affected more than half of the country's population.Overdrawal of electricity, beyond their allocated quota, by some states, was cited as among the reasons for failure of grids last year.Recently, Power Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia had said that private sector participation is being looked in the transmission sector and hence there is a need to make POSOCO a separate entity.In 2012-13 financial year, POSOCO registered a net profit of Rs 85.65 crore while the turnover touched Rs 266.37 crore."

The government plans to speed up the process of raising up to Rs 3,000 crore by selling five per cent stake in Power Grid Corp, even as the state-run company looks to raise fresh equity to fund its expansion activities, a Power Ministry official has said.

""The company may also raise some fresh equity to fund its expansion plans,"" the official told PTI. The government, which currently holds 69.42 per cent stake in Power Grid, plans to sell 5 per cent stake in the company, which could fetch the exchequer over Rs 3,000 crore. Earlier this month, the Board of Directors of the company approved stake sale to the tune of 15 per cent of existing paid up share capital comprising fresh issue of 69,44,58,802 equity shares.The proposal is subject to necessary regulatory approvals. The mode of disinvestment may be offer for sale (OFS). The offer-for-sale method was introduced by market regulator SEBI early this year and allows companies to sell shares in a simplified process on the stock market platform through a one- day bidding process.Power Grid is engaged in power transmission business with the responsibility for planning, coordination, supervision and control over inter-state transmission system and operation of national and regional power grids. The government has targeted Rs 40,000 crore by way of PSU stake sales this fiscal year has raised about Rs 1,000 crore so far.Power Grid reported a net profit of Rs 1,040.34 crore in the April-June quarter of the current financial year.

Prabhudas Lilladher has come out with its report on capital goods. According to the research firm, Thermax, KEC International, Bharat Electronics (BEL) and Power Grid are the top pick in the sector.

""Capital Goods, order flow for the quarter for our coverage universe was up 13% to Rs317bn. The commentary on new orders was mixed bag with most corporate waiting to see real change at ground level after various measures taken by government recently. The outlook on industrials were largely subdued, however commentary suggest uptick expected in few industry like cement and Oil& Gas. On the infrastructure side the commentary in power BTG/roads continued to be weak with shrinking pipeline of new orders. The commentary in power T&D and urban infrastructure showed some positive trend. The companies also reiterated their focus on international markets to counter domestic slowdown.

The order book for the sector was down 2% YoY to Rs3.3trn, with B2B ratio of 2.2xTTM sales (down from peak of 2.92x in Q2FY11). Recent weakness in consumer segment in IIP numbers and weak commentary on festival sales are indicating towards moderating demand. CMIE’s new project announcement (back to 2004 levels), suggest continued weakness (down 55% for 9MFY13). While moderating inflation and weak growth has raised hope for steeper rate cuts over next 6 months to improve sentiment and to revive growth. However we believe real uptick in investment cycle will only happen after concrete measure is taken in areas of land acquisition, faster clearances processes and improving coal availability.

Sales for the quarter up only 6.3% YoY (12 quarter low ). Tight liquidity and delay in clearance at clients end is clearly taking toll on execution and impacting sales growth. EBITDA for the sector was down 13% YoY to Rs36.9bn. Margins for the sector came down shapely by 213bps YoY to 9.8%. Slower pace of orders over the last few quarters (leading to higher competition and lower margins) is clearly showing up in the margins, apart from increased raw material and weak rupee. Most companies acknowledged the increasing competitive intensity in both domestic and international markets. Slowing demand has made cost pass-through difficult, putting pressure on margins.

Interest cost for the sector was up 32% YoY. The interest cost for the sector has been rising at average 20-22% YoY for last 12 quarters now. Rise in interest expense was across the board. Interest cost % sales increased by 27bps to 1.37%. Apart from increased borrowing cost, the major culprit was the elongated working capital cycle (lower advances due to lower order flow and higher debtor days due to tight liquidity situation). PAT for the sector was down 11% YoY to Rs 26.4bn. Our top pick in the sector are Thermax, KEC International, Bharat Electronics (BEL) and Power Grid,"" says Prabhudas Lilladher research report.

Motilal Oswal has come out with its report on capital goods sector. According to the research firm, competitive intensity in the Indian T&D equipment sector remains high. The low product prices would keep margins under pressure at least in the near to medium term. Prefer Crompton Greaves over Siemens, ABB, says MOST.

Capital Goods: Green energy corridors / intra-state transmission network / substation automation projects are likely to contribute incrementally to order intake in FY14/FY15. Several of these projects will necessitate technology upgradation by Indian companies. The tough stance taken by governments globally against aggressive imports is likely to curb competitive intensity. We believe that industry profitability will now be determined by rivalry amongst existing players, as the threat of imports / new entrants has reduced. After significant erosion in the last few years, industry profitability is stabilizing at lower levels. There are no signs of improvement, yet. We maintain Neutral on the T&D Equipment sector, and prefer Crompton Greaves over ABB / Siemens.

Power Grid (PWGR) ordering is likely to plateau, as most of the 12th Plan (FY12-17) projects have already been tendered out. However, there exist upside possibilities from (i) green energy corridors (investment plan: INR400b), (ii) intra-state transmission projects (as strengthening of the sub-transmission network in the states is an important part of the chain and several states are forming JVs / MoUs with PWGR), and (iii) substation automation (particularly post the blackouts in July 2012). We expect project awards to accelerate in FY14/FY15. Several of these projects will necessitate technology upgradation by Indian companies.

In the recent months, governments across the globe have taken a tough stance towards aggressive equipment imports, imposing anti-dumping duties / stringent conditions. Such actions, in our opinion, have set a strong precedent. Several Chinese and Korean players have announced plans to set up local transformer manufacturing capacities in India - while this provides a level playing field for domestic players, it also increases domestic capacity and the incumbents could retaliate through further capacity expansions which could permanently alter the industry structure.

Profitability in power products has eroded over the last 3-4 years, with EBIT margins declining from a peak of 15-19% in FY09 to 7-8%. This is a function of increased competitive intensity, resulting in 25-30% decline in transformer prices. With product prices bottoming out and prices of raw material (CRGO electrical steel) easing, margins are showing signs of stabilization. On the back of PWGR ordering, the demand for MVA power transformers is up ~2x from 2008 levels, while the demand for distribution transformers continues to be at 2008 levels. We believe that power products should see improved demand environment, given that several SEBs have raised tariffs over the past 18 months. The financial restructuring proposals of SEBs will also lead to improved liquidity.

Competitive intensity in the Indian T&D equipment sector remains high. We believe that low product prices would keep margins under pressure at least in the near to medium term. We maintain Neutral on the T&D sector, with preference for Crompton Greaves over Siemens / ABB

Motilal Oswal has come out with its earnings estimates on utilities sector for December quarter FY13. The research firm expects utility companies in their coverage to report aggregate 3QFY13 revenue growth of 15% YoY and PAT growth of 12% YoY. Muted PAT growth is on account muted PAT of few IPP's however CPSU's led by NTPC (higher capacity addition), PGCIL (better Capitalization) would show PAT growth of 11% and 31% YoY respectively. Amongst the IPPs, JSW energy is expected to report strong PAT growth (2x YoY), due to low base/robust performance and ST prices in 3QFY13.

: Power sector has begun to witness several initiatives by authorities to address concerns on SEBs, fuel supply pacts and PPAs. However, it would take a while for clarity on several issues to emerge. Hence, we continue to prefer CPSUs which are relatively better-positioned on these fronts. Top picks are NTPC and Power Grid.

After a week of consolidation, the market ends at the high point of the day with Nifty ending a tad below 5900 levels on Friday. For the week, both frontline and the broader markets ended marginally in the positive territory.

Moneycontrol.com got Unicon Financial Intermediaries's Madhumita Ghosh to answer the stock queries readers sent us on ouras part of our KYI (Know Your Investment) initiative.Can you suggest five stocks for five-year horizon?My top five stock picks for long term are M&M ITC and TCS Which are your top picks for the short-term? Larsen & Toubro (L&T), IVRCL Mahindra Satyam and Hindustan Zinc What are your views on NTPC and Larsen and Toubro for this month?NTPC is next on the government's divestment agenda. The issue is likely to hit the market around January 15, 2013. The Government proposes to divest 9.5 percent stake in NTPC via Offer for Sale (auction) route. NTPC posted excellent set of numbers in Q2FY13 surpassing consensus estimates for the quarter. Despite being a seasonally weak quarter when the company resorted to plant shutdowns the company managed to post excellent growth in profitability driven primarily by lower fuel expenses and few one off income. One could buy now and at every decline as it is near 52 week low. The issues with coal India seems to be getting sorted out and they are expected to sign the fuel supply pacts and we expect the stock to move up this month.Larsen & Toubro is a fundamentally sound company. The Q2 results were better than expectations. Recently the company won orders worth Rs 1200 crore in various sectors like solar power, EPC etc. Technically, it has crossed the 30-day and 50-day moving average and thus expected to move up with the market. In the short term, it can move past the 52-week high of Rs 1720.Is HDFC a 'buy' now?Yes, one can buy HDFC now for medium to long-term as the demand is expected to move up further with peaking out of interest rate.I have 135 shares of Bharat Heavy Electricals ( BHEL ) at Rs 361. What should to do?To reach the price of Rs 135, it will take long as the fundamentals are not much in favour. Order book is also not that buoyant. So hold for temporary upside till Rs 260 levels and switch thereafter to Cummins or any other fundamentally strong stock.What is your view on Power Grid Corporation of India? Power Grid is fundamentally good stock but will be a slow mover in a bull market as its beta is low.I have 100 shares of Steel Authority of India (SAIL) at Rs 95. What would be your advice now?Metals are looking good for medium to long-term but SAIL compared to other stocks looks weak. Fundamentals are also not strong. Inventory pile up and timely commission of new projects are a concern. One can exit and switch to Hindalco or Hindustan Zinc even Sesa Goa (for high risk investors).What is your call on Sesa Goa At this point of time the future is uncertain with the Goa government and Karnataka govt putting a ban on mining companies.. Supreme court panel recommended scrapping 42 iron ore mining leases in Goa until mining companies submit plans to deal with the environmental impact and the legal details involved Even when it is resumed it would be opening with a cap..It is better to be away from the stock until visibility comes.Can you recommend three multibaggers? TV18 Broadcast and Allahabad Bank Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is part of Network 18 Group, which owns TV18 Broadcast.What are views on Housing Development and Infrastructure (HDIL)? HDIL s results were pretty encouraging. With sentiment towards the sector improving and Bombay continues to witness buoyancy in real estate prices HDIL continues to be a favourite pick in the space. Target price for a year could be Rs 150.Can I buy Hexaware Technologies at current level?The price has reacted downward due to the revision of revenue guidance for December.The company now expects revenue for the December quarter at USD 92 million, down from an earlier guidance of USD 94.7 million-USD 96.5 million. Hexaware also expects EBITDA margins to be impacted by 500-700 bps on a/c of the revenue losses. Company expects to recoup them from Q1CY13 onwardsOne can start accumulating at every decline as other fundamentals remain intact and valuations become compelling. One can get a 15 to 20% upside.Where are GVK Power & Infrastructure and 3i Infotech headed? GVK Power looks to be a good long-term bet."

Of the five Maharatna PSUs, four of them - Coal India, Indian Oil Corporation, ONGC and SAIL - have not fully used funds earmarked for CSR in the last fiscal, Minister of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Praful Patel said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.

During 2011-12, CIL earmarked an amount of Rs 553 crore but spent merely Rs 77 crore while ONGC allocated Rs 378 crore and utilised only Rs 121 crore, the figures tabled in the House said. Indian Oil Corporation allocated about Rs 96 crore and used only Rs 83 crore and SAIL allocation was Rs 64 crore and utilised amount was Rs 61 crore, for carrying out CSR activities.

is not mandated to earmark specific funds for CSR activities.

According to the guidelines on CSR for CPSEs, the CSR budget has to be mandatorily allocated through a board resolution as percentage of net profit in the previous year. PSUs whose net profit is less than Rs 100 crore have to contribute 3-5 per cent of their income for CSR while PSUs with profits between Rs 100-500 crore would be required to earmark 2-3 per cent.

Further, those companies earning a profit of Rs 500 crore and above, CSR spending should be between 0.5 to 2 per cent of their net profit. Patel said : ""The CSR budget is to be fixed for each fiscal and this fund does not lapse. The unutilised funds in a particular year have to be transfered to a CSR fund which will accumulate."" He, however said, loss-making companies are not mandated to earmark specific funds for CSR activities."

Prabhudas Lilladher has come out with its report on capital goods space. Voltas, Thermax, KEC International and Power Grid are the top picks in capital goods space.

Capital Goods index has outperformed the broader index by ~1.9% over the last three months. While the most of macro data that came out recently continues to point continued weakness, the outperformance has come on the back of hope of improved government appetite for action/reforms after recent token reforms like SEB bailout, FDI in retail, hike in diesel prices etc. How soon government follows up with concrete reforms in area of coal, land and quick clearance remains to be seen. Till then we survive on hope!Order flow for the quarter for our coverage universe was down 22% to Rs313bn (excl. L&T orders which were down 57% YoY). The order flow had shown some hope last quarter (Q1FY13) by growing 28% YoY after four quarters of de-growth. While commentary on T&D order and short-cycle order continued to be encouraging, commentary on infrastructure projects, industrial recovery and global markets continues to be subdued. The recent token policy reforms and expectation of rate cut has resulted in hope of recovery for most players.The order book for the sector was down 3.5% YoY to Rs3.48trn, with B2B ratio of 2.2xTTM sales (down from peak of 2.92x in Q2FY11). The macro data, be it weak IIP numbers, dismal capacity utilization data (RBI data suggest it is at 13-quarter low), CMIE’s new project announcement (back to 2004 levels), suggest continued weakness. However, the corporate commentary suggested that things should improve in the second half suggesting that bottom might be formed, but hope of some government action to kick-start investment cycle is building hope of recovery (which remains to be seen). Quick formation of national investment board could improve hope of fast tracking of big ticket infrastructure projects and removing bottleneck of slow clearances.EBITDA for the sector was up 2.8% YoY to Rs40.2bn. Margins for the sector came down by 46bps YoY to 11.2%. Slower pace of orders over the last few quarters (leading to higher competition and lower margins) is clearly showing up in the margins, apart from increased raw material and weak rupee. Most companies acknowledged the increasing competitive intensity in both domestic and international markets. Slowing demand has made cost pass-through difficult, putting pressure on margins.Interest cost for the sector was up 25% YoY. Rise in interest expense was across the board. Apart from increased borrowing cost, the major culprit was the elongated working capital cycle (lower advances due to lower order flow and higher debtor days due to tight liquidity situation). PAT growth was at 2.3% YoY.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Prabhudas Lilladher has come out with its report on capital goods space. According to research firm capital goods index has outperformed the broader index by 5% over the last three months.

Government off-late has been making lot of positive noises which hasn’t been backed by concrete action. RBI’s ability to act has been hindered by government inaction on the fiscal front and high inflation, while government perceives rate cut as a way to boost growth. Recent downgrade of GDP estimate for FY13 and risk of rating downgrade has added to the uncertainty. So India Inc. continues to live with an uncertain outlook albeit with a hope of revival for the time being (as it has been for last several quarters). We might be closing in but it’s still tough to call the bottom yet.Order flow for the quarter for our coverage universe was up 28% YoY to Rs357bn (excl. L&T and BHEL, order flow is up 7% YoY). Order flows have shown growth in the current quarter after showing de-growth YoY for the previous four quarters. While commentary on T&D order and short-cycle order continued to be positive, commentary on infrastructure projects and industrial recovery continues to be weak.The order book for the sector was flat YoY to Rs3.5trn with B2B ratio of 2.3xTTM sales (down from peak of 2.92x in Q2FY11). High interest, policy inaction, land and environment clearance issues and tight liquidity were cited as primary reasons for uncertain macro environment. Increasing focus on export market (mainly MENA region) to counter domestic slowdown continued to be visible. CMIE data on new project announcement continues to show a declining trend. Increase in projects shelved also point to a weak outlook in the near term. Strong ordering from Power Grid supported order flow for many T&D companies. However, with peaking ordering cycle, companies will have to look at other areas to support incremental growth.EBITDA for the sector was up 9.6% YoY to Rs34bn. Margins for the sector came down by 67bps YoY to 10.5%. Slower pace of order over the last few quarters (leading to higher competition) is clearly showing up in the margins, apart from increased raw material and weak rupee. Most companies acknowledged the increasing competitive intensity in both domestic and international markets. Slowing demand has made cost pass through difficult, putting pressure on margins.Interest cost for the sector was up 34% YoY. Rise in interest expense was across the board. Apart from increased borrowing cost, the major culprit was the elongated working capital cycle (lower advances due to lower order flow and higher debtor days due to tight liquidity situation). PAT growth was at 9.3%. Voltas is trading at 11.5x FY14E earnings. We believe that the worst might be behind us, given that the large part of provision on the Sidra project has already been accounted for. Write-back from the Sidra project could provide positive surprises. The outlook might be slightly muted in the near term on order flow. Voltas has increased its reach in terms of geography in the international markets and business segments in the domestic market which should help order flow once the cycle turns. We believe that a lot of pessimism related to order flow is in the price and hence, downside seems to be limited. Live KEC is trading at 5.5x FY14E earnings. The company’s strong order book, continuing growth in order pipeline and ability to win orders in the current environment gives comfort on revenue visibility. Improved balance sheet gives additional comfort. We expect the stock to deliver earnings CAGR of 20% over FY12-14E. Power Grid is trading at 1.6x FY14E book value. The company sounded confident of achieving its implied guidance for capitalization for FY13 (~Rs200bn). It also tried to soothe investor’s nerves on dilution by assuring that it can avoid dilution (by tweaking D:E ratio requirement for 1-2 years). We expect the stock to deliver earnings CAGR of 16.2% over FY12- 17E.: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Transmission major Power Grid is also bearing the brunt of poor financial health of power distribution companies as discoms are yet to pay dues of Rs 550-600 crore to the state-run company.



""Transmission charges due from distribution companies, including those from Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, are about Rs 550-600 crore,"" a senior Power Grid official told PTI.



Discoms have to pay Power Grid charges related to carrying electricity to the grid.



""We have submitted a petition to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) to recover the outstanding dues,"" the official said.



Generally, discoms have a period of 60 days - from the day of electricity transmission -- to pay the required charges to Power Grid. If payments are not made during that period, then the total charges are considered as dues.



According to the official, total monthly transmission charges are about Rs 950 crore.



Power Grid is responsible for transmission of electricity across the country.



The company plans to add about 40,000 circuit kilometres in the 12th Five-Year Plan period ending March 2017. Currently, it has over 94,000 circuit kilometres of lines. One circuit kilometre generally refers to one kilometre of electrical transmission line.



The precarious financial health of discoms is a major concern for the power sector and the government is working on restructuring their debt worth about Rs 2 lakh crore.



Lower tariff realisation and high transmission and distribution losses have been mainly blamed for the poor financial position of discoms.



As per the Shunglu panel report released last year, the net loss, after subsidies, of 15 discoms - which account for over 90 per cent of the country's power consumption - was Rs 27,000 crore for the year ended March 31, 2010."

Motilal Oswal has come out with its report on utilities sector.

Fuel supply and power distribution are two key issues affecting the Utilities sector. Improvement on these two counts alone can revive interest/investment in the sector. Hence, PMO (Prime Minister’s office) is focusing on (1) “fuelling” all projects in the system (to meet PLF of at least 85%), and also (2) reviving discoms. Coal supply issue can be mitigated through imports, which would necessitate coal price pooling – a blended price for all projects across the country. This may lead to several winners/losers, possible apprehension from few States, etc, which would have to be overlooked for a robust sector. Improvement in gas supply may not be as easy to sort out given EGoM’s involvement, low domestic availability and higher cost of LNG imports. Current power tariffs are not feasible and separate peaking power tariff system is possibly the only solution.The debt restructuring plan for discoms is awaiting cabinet nod. The plan is intended to ease discoms’ cash flow commitment, given that it proposes 50% debt be taken over by States and moratorium worked out for the balance debt. This, along with tariff hike, would mean improved cash flow, leading to higher power demand.Developers with captive coal block would have to pass on the benefit to consumer, as more domestic availability of coal would mean lower burden to consumer, and less reliance on imported coal. Recent views aired by authorities suggest that developers with captive coal blocks would be asked to compulsorily participate in competitive bidding, and if not, face cancellation of coal blocks with retrospective effect. This is however contingent on start of new round of bidding from discoms.Limited option with authorities; yet smooth transition unlikely There are very limited options with authorities ""given consequences on financial sector"", and little space for any bold steps other than support all the capacity that is added/being added. Radical changes like coal price pooling could face challenges given involvement of various States (resource rich states may not agree as they might be at disadvantage). Also, certain class of developers (e.g. NTPC) may not be entirely in agreement. Thus, there remains limited visibility on possible outcome, while the attention from highest authorities is comforting. We believe, in any event, CPSUs like NTPC and Power Grid are better placed and remain positive.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

UR Associates has come out with its report on infra sector.



Critical infrastructure sector clocked negative growth in 2011- 12: The annual performance of the crucial infrastructure sectors, including telecom, highways, cargo handling, fertiliser production, natural gas, and export and import cargo handled at airports, all registered negative growth in 2011-12, according to report compiled by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI). In the case of roads, NHAI widened/upgraded 2,248.55 km of highways during 2011-12. It was 10.1% lower than the target of 2,500 km for the period. It was also 29% less than that achieved in the previous year.

In the case of roads, NHAI widened/upgraded 2,248.55 km of highways during 2011-12. It was 10.1% lower than the target of 2,500 km for the period. It was also 29% less than that achieved in the previous year. India seeks infrastructure boost from China: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has called for greater Chinese investment in the Indian infrastructure sector in his meeting with China's Prime Minister Wen Jiiabao, as the government pursues its $1 trillion investment target in this sector. The Prime Minister said ""We are clear. Chinese investment in infrastructure is welcome"".

The Reserve Bank of India, at its quarterly monetary policy review on June 18, 2012, kept policy rates unchanged in view of rising inflation and global economic uncertainty, disappointing the players in the infrastructure space which expected further cut in policy rates. Also, the cash reserve ratio (CRR) has been kept unchanged at 4.75%. As per Business Standard, the manufacturing of engineering products has slowed sharply during the first quarter of the current fiscal and the industry sees plant utilisation to drop by 10-20% in capital goods segment as well as in the engineering sector. Several players in this space have decided to curtail their operations by about 10-20% from this month onwards to reduce their working capital requirement. However, later in the week, the sector cheered after the news that the government is likely to impose a 21% import duty on power equipments. The move if imposed will curb the import of cheap Chinese equipment thus boosting the demand for products of domestic equipment makers.Power Grid Corporation of India is planning to get into distribution business and is scouting for power distribution opportunities overseas. Besides, it is trying to branch into EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) business in other countries. The company currently has 19 overseas projects that mainly involve consultancy in power transmission. It has international projects of around Rs 105 bn under execution. Mr. R. N. Nayak, Chairman and Managing Director, Power Grid, told Business Standard that they were not only looking for transmission, but also distribution business. “We have executed around 33% of rural electrification where we are distributing power as franchisee. Though we have experience, we can enter distribution business provided we are able to buy and trade power in the domestic market,” he said. Mr. Nayak said the company wanted to expand its overseas portfolio by going beyond consultancy. Besides consultancy, the company’s international foray is also focusing on asset management, EPC and joint venture/acquisition.Power generation utilities from the Philippines, Taiwan and South Korea, including Korea Electric Power Corp. (Kepco), may buy 30 mn tonnes of coal a year from the GVK Group’s mines in Australia that it acquired from Georgina Hope Rinehart’s Hancock Group for $1.26 bn last year. Also, once the project receives environmental clearance, these firms may also acquire a stake in GVK Coal Developers (Singapore) Pte Ltd that holds the assets in Australia. The mandate for divesting part of the company’s stake in the coal mines has been given to Macquarie Capital, according to a person familiar with the development. However, Mr. A. Issac George, Director and Chief Financial Officer of GVK Power and Infrastructure Ltd, declined comment. In September, GVK group acquired a 79% stake in Tad’s Corner and Paul’s Corner, and a complete acquisition of Kevin’s Corner mines located in the Galilee Basin in Queensland. The group, through its subsidiaries, also acquired the rail and port project connecting the coal mines that involves the construction of a 495km railroad and a 60 mn tonnes per annum (mtpa) port at Abbot Point. At full production, the mines are expected to produce 84 mtpa of coal. GVK may need the financial support and technical expertise of partners to develop the mines, and the rail and port projects, with the overall investment required in the first phase pegged at $10 billion.Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has decided to initiate a fund-raising exercise, one of the largest in the space in recent times, for its wholly-owned infrastructure development arm L&T Infrastructure Development Projects (L&T IDPL). L&T had mandated Morgan Stanley to help it raise $400-500 mn (Rs 22.0-27.5 bn at Rs 55 to a dollar) for a minority stake in the company from financial sponsors like large sovereign funds or long-term infrastructuresector- focused private equity investors or even deep-pocket global pension funds, said people familiar with the ongoing discussions. Sources close to the developments said, even though a formal valuation exercise is yet to get completed, the initial back of the envelope calculations suggest that the equity valuation of L&T IDPL alone would be in excess of Rs 110 bn ($2 bn). L&T may dilute anything between 12-20%, depending on investor appetite. Considering the company still has to undergo significant capex and some of its flagship ventures will take at least five-seven years to reach cash flows, only long-term investors would be approached.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Prabhudas Lilladher has come out with its report on capital goods sector. Voltas, KEC International and Power Grid are the top pick in the sector.

Capital goods index has underperformed the broader index by 6% over the last three months. The sector continues to be stuck with “Hope” of recovery on one end and reality of deteriorating macro variables on the other. After the surprise cut of 50bps in the last policy statement by RBI, it had indicated that more cuts will be difficult to come by. However, the recent fall in crude prices and multi-year low GDP of 5.3% is likely to set the stage for further rate cuts during the course of the year. Though rate cuts will act as a definite sentiment booster, a meaningful recovery in investment cycle has to be triggered by policy action. Till then search for bottom continues.Weakness in macro environment was clearly visible in the order inflow number for the sector. Order inflow for the sector was down 37% YoY to Rs408bn in Q4FY12. The order book for the sector was down 1.2% YoY to Rs3.4trn with B2B ratio of 2.3xTTM sales (down from peak of 2.92x in Q2FY11). The order flow continued to decline YoY for the fourth quarter in a row. High interest, policy inaction, land and environment clearance issues and tight liquidity were cited as the primary reasons. One visible change in commentary was increased focus on export markets (mainly MENA region) to counter domestic slowdown. Though lot of companies were able to grow short cycle product order flow, the commentary lacked confidence of continuation in demand. CMIE data on new project announcement continues to show a declining trend. Increase in projects shelved also point to a weak outlook in the near term. Strong ordering from Power Grid supported order flow for many T&D companies. However, with peaking ordering cycle, companies will have to look at other areas to support incremental growth.EBITDA for the sector was up 10.6% YoY to Rs85.6bn (largely disguised by BHEL). Margins for the sector came down by 120bps YoY to 11.6% (Adj. for BHEL). Slower pace of order over the last few quarters (leading to higher competition) is clearly showing up in the margins, apart from increased raw material and weak rupee. Slowing demand has made cost pass through difficult, putting pressure on margins.Interest cost for the sector was up 10% YoY. Rise in interest expense was across the board. Apart from increased borrowing cost, the major culprit was elongated working capital cycle (lower advances due to lower order flow and higher debtor days due to tight liquidity situation). PAT growth was at 11% (Adj. for BHEL, it would have been at 0.9%).The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management. Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions.

Motilal Oswal has come out with its report on power sector. NTPC and Power Grid are the top picks in the sector.

Coal India : We expect COAL to report consolidated PAT of INR174b in FY13E (up 8% YoY, downgrade of 2%) and INR188b in FY14E (up 9% YoY, downgrade of 5%). Cut in earnings is to factor in no compensatory price hike for wage increase (factored at ~12% on notified coal), which is partially mitigated through operating leverage, increase in dispatch estimates and lower consolidated tax. Buy. Power Grid : We upgrade our FY13/14E earnings by ~10% to factor in higher capitalization (considered ~85% of current management guidance of INR200b). We expect PGCIL to report net profit of INR40b in FY13E (up 13% YoY), and INR48.4b in FY14E (up 22% YoY). Buy with TP of INR123/sh. Tata Power : We cut our FY13/14E earnings by 11% / 8% to factor in lower coal realisation (RB index down 6% from Mar-12 levels). Factors such as 1) higher production cost, lower than expected volume growth and further pressure on realisation at KPC/Arutmin mines, 2) lower contribution from Maithon project in FY13E, and 3) accounting of “distribution” on perpetual debt could further put pressure on earnings. Neutral. PTC India : We expect PTCIN to report consolidated profit of INR2.2b (7% growth) in FY13 and INR2.8b (26% growth) in FY14. Buy with a target price of INR60 (excluding INR45/share debtors pending for recovery as at March 2012).The power sector has seen significant valuation de-rating due to concerns over delayed capacity additions, merchant prices, lower demand and fuel supply issues. We are positive about companies that are relatively better positioned on these fronts. Our top picks in the sector are NTPC and Powergrid.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Motilal Oswal has come with its December quarterly earning estimates for utilities sector. The research firm expects utility companies in their coverage (ex Coal India) to report aggregate 3QFY12 revenue growth of 28% YoY and PAT growth of 20% YoY, driven by capacity addition and strong merchant realization.

All-India generation up 10% YoY in Oct-Nov 2011: All India generation growth is led by growth in installed capacity base of coal plants (13GW addition YoY) and elevated PLF of hydro/nuclear plants (up 300bp/600bp YoY). YTDFY12, India has commissioned ~10.3GW capacity (~90% thermal), and has achieved ~62% of FY12 capacity addition target. In 11th Plan (FY08-12, till Nov-11), India has commissioned ~45GW projects. Revised CEA estimate is to add ~52GW during the Plan, implying targeted addition of 7GW (~1.7.GW/month) over remaining part of FY12.

Consumption growth strong; base deficit widening: Over Oct-Nov 2011, power demand in India grew 12% YoY (much higher 20% YoY in Nov-11). However, power availability (generation) grew only 8% during this period, widening the base deficit (Nov- 11 base deficit stood at 10%). YTDFY12, base deficit for the sector stood at 7%, marginally lower than YTDFY11 base-deficit level of 9%.

Coal supply issues; higher demand supports ST power tariffs: Average spot rate at IEX was INR4.9/unit over October to 3rd week of December 2011 (up 100% YoY and 61% QoQ). Spike in near-term prices for shorter duration contracts was led by Telangana strike and lower coal availability. We believe this sudden spurt in ST (short-term) rates is temporary and driven by various one-off factors concurring at the same time. Imported coal prices for 3QFY12 stood at USD107/ton, down 3% YoY and 8% QoQ. USD over same period strengthened 11% YoY and 8% QoQ.

Valuation and view: Power sector has seen significant valuation de-rating due to concerns over fuel supply, project viability, SEB finances, etc. In this environment, we remain upbeat on companies which are relatively better positioned on these fronts. Our top picks are NTPC, Power Grid and Coal India."

ASHOK LEYLAND

: BUY, TP-Rs 38 (41% upside)



Our earnings estimates for FY11 and FY12 are Rs 2.5 and Rs 3.1 respectively. Our FY12 earnings estimate is 3% higher than consensus estimate of Rs 2.4. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 38, which discounts FY13E earnings by 12.5x.

ASHOKA BUILDCON

: BUY, TP-Rs 363 (51% upside)

Our FY12 and FY13 earnings estimates are Rs 21.6 and Rs 25.7, 12.1% and 15.3% lower than consensus estimates respectively. We expect top-line growth of 54.4% and 15.6% to Rs 20.1bn and Rs 23.3bn in FY12 and FY13 vs. consensus forecasts of 46.8% and 21.5% to Rs 19.1bn and Rs 23.2bn, respectively. We value BOT (on a DCF basis) at FY12E and FY13E equity multiples of 1.6x and 1.1x, respectively. Our SOTP-based target price is Rs 363, where BOT is valued at Rs 218 and EPC at Rs 145 (9x FY12E earnings). The stock offers an upside potential of 51% at our SOTP-based target price of Rs 363 vs. consensus target of Rs 344.

Our FY12 and FY13 earnings estimates are Rs 107.5 and Rs 123.3, respectively. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,850 discounting FY13E earnings at 15x. Our FY12 earnings estimate is 1.2% higher than the consensus estimate of Rs 106.3.

HCL TECH

: BUY, TP-Rs 490 (14% upside)

Our revenue estimate for FY12 is higher by 3% than consensus while the estimate for FY13 is 1% lower. EBITDA margin estimates vary from consensus by 80bps and (30bps) for FY12 and FY13 respectively. EPS estimate is 10% higher for FY12 while marginally lower at -1% for FY13.

Our revenue estimates are marginally higher than consensus at 0.6% and 0.3% for FY12 and FY13 respectively. EBITDA margin estimates are higher by 120bps for FY12 and 40bps for FY13. EPS estimates vary from consensus at 2.8% and 1% for FY12 and FY13 respectively.

IRB INFRASTRUCTURE

: BUY, TP-Rs 216 (33% upside)

Our FY12 and FY13 earnings estimates are Rs 14.5 and Rs 12.5, 1% and 23.3% lower than consensus estimates respectively. We expect top-line growth of 28.2% and 22.3% to Rs 31.3bn and Rs 38.2bn in FY12 and FY13 vs. consensus forecasts of 30.5% and 30.5% to Rs 31.8bn and Rs 41.5bn, respectively. We believe the recent correction in its share price provides a good entry point for long-term investors. The stock offers an upside potential of 33% at our SOTP-based target price of Rs 216 vs. consensus target of Rs 210.

JAGRAN PRAKASHAN

(JPL): BUY, TP-Rs 148 (35% upside)

Our FY13 revenue estimate is 5% below consensus. However, our FY13 EPS estimate of Rs 8 is in-line with estimates. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 148 (18xFY13E EPS).

JYOTHY LABORATORIES

: BUY, TP-Rs 212 (53% upside)

Our estimates for FY13 are among the highest on the street, led by expectation of better performance of the core business and sustainability of Henkel's profitable performance. We assign 16x to FY13E earnings and add Rs 12/share NPV on tax saving of Rs 1.2bn @12% discount rate to derive the TP of Rs 212.

Our FY12 and FY13 earnings forecast are Rs 45.7 and Rs 52.9 respectively. Our FY12 earning estimate is in line with the consensus estimate. We value M&M at Rs 898 using SOTP methodology, discounting the standalone business at 13x FY13E earnings.

Our estimates and target price are lower than the consensus, led by the expectation of pressure on EBITDA margin and argument of narrowing down of the Nestle's valuation premium. We assign P/E of 30x on the next 12-months earnings to derive TP of Rs 3,578.

NIIT TECH

: BUY, TP-Rs 285 (36% upside)

Our top-line estimate for FY12 is higher by 2.7% than consensus and marginally higher by 1.3% than consensus for FY13. Our EBITDA margin estimates are marginally lower by 40bps and 50bps for FY12 and FY13 respectively.

POWER GRID

: BUY, TP-Rs 120 (15% upside)

Our FY12 & FY13 PAT estimates are in line with consensus. We value PGCIL on FCFE basis to arrive at a target price of Rs 120 (terminal growth rate 3% and 13% Ke).

SINTEX INDUSTRIES

: BUY, TP-Rs 240 (118% upside)

Our earnings estimates (EPS) for FY12 and FY13 are Rs 20.2 and Rs 23.6, respectively. Our FY12 earnings estimate is 1% higher than consensus estimate of Rs 19.9. We have a 'BUY' recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 240, which discounts FY12E earnings by 12x.

TECPRO SYSTEMS

: BUY, TP-Rs 375 (75% upside)

We expect EPS of Rs 31 and Rs 37.4 in FY12E and FY13E, respectively, almost in line with consensus forecasts. We expect 9% growth in order inflow in FY12, whereas some analysts forecast de-growth of ~30-35%. However, the management has guided for ~30% growth in order inflow in FY12. We have a BUY recommendation with a target price of Rs 375 (10x FY13E).

Investors can read in the detailed analysis before agreeing to any or all the bets.

My first pick for today is Century Textiles , it is a buy call. The company has reflected near term strength. It has taken support on the 55-day exponential moving average. Keeping that in mind, one can buy Century Textiles around Rs 321 with a stoploss of Rs 318 & a target of Rs 327. This is a shorter term call valid from an intra-day point of view.My second pick for today is Bharti Airtel . It has reflected weakness. The stock has closed below the 55-day exponential moving average. The stock has also posted a fresh 5-trading session low.The mechanical indicators are reflecting weakness that too after reflecting negative divergence. So Bharti looks like a great short term sell. Keeping that in mind, one can sell Bharti at around Rs 385, with a stoploss of Rs 389 & a target of Rs 377. This is a shorter term call valid from an intra-day point of view._PAGEBREAK_Yesterday when most of power stocks did good, Power Grid did not participate there. But one can buy Power Grid between its support of Rs 101-102 with a stoploss at Rs 100, for a higher target of Rs 106 in coming days. ITC took a correction in last three days & is now near its important support. One can buy the stock between its support of Rs 205-208, with a stoploss of Rs 203. It has a target of Rs 214._PAGEBREAK_My first stock for today is ABB . This stock is showing some weak patterns. We can sell it around Rs 675 with a stoploss above Rs 690, for a target around Rs 655-660. Below Rs 655, this stock will show a further breakdown & it can touch even Rs 600 later on.My second stock for today is SBI . SBI is showing some consolidation pattern between Rs 1925-1875. We can buy it at current market price with a stoploss below Rs 1875 for a target of around Rs 1975."

India's power sector could see ""tougher times ahead"" due to depleting inventory of key raw material coal, forcing several power stations to operate at extremely low stock levels, brokerage CLSA said in a note on Monday.

As many as 29 power stations, of the 86 coal-based power projects in India, are currently operating with less than 4 days coal stock and 44 with less than 7 days stock, CLSA said, adding it was ""underweight"" on the sector.

India's power supply situation will improve in the next four-five days as coal supply to power plants is slowly picking up, Power Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said on Friday.

Coal production in India has been impacted by heavy rains in Orissa and strikes in Singareni Collieries Company Ltd, which contributes to nearly 10 percent of India's coal production.

Coal India

, the world's biggest coal miner, produced 8% less in the September quarter while despatches fell 5% on year.

""The coal despatch by road is likely to be impacted in third quarter as well given the damage to haul roads because of the heavy rains,"" CLSA said.

Due to a coal shortage, CLSA expects merchant tariffs to ""shoot up"" in the interim, benefitting

Jindal Steel and Power

,

JSW Energy

,

Lanco Infratech

and

Adani Power

.

CLSA pegged

Power Grid

as the ""safest play"" in the sector, followed by

NTPC

and

Tata Power

. ""Avoid all others,"" it added."

The divestment programme for 2011-12 could be starting with Power Finance Corporation's follow-on public offer (FPO), reports CNBC-TV18. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has set the divestment target of Rs 40,000 crore for FY12.

PFC FPO is likely in the first week of May, for which the company may file a red herring prospectus (DRHP) in the third week of this month.

ONGC and SAIL FPOs, which had been planned in FY11, are likely to happen in the first quarter. But Indian Oil's follow-on public offer is not likely to be rolled out before the end of this year.

The finance ministry has prepared a cabinet note for National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) IPO, where 10% divestment is likely.

MMTC and RINL FPOs are also likely in FY12.

In FY11, the government had garnered more than Rs 22,000 crore through share sale of SJVN, EIL, Coal India, MOIL, Power Grid and SCI while the divestment target was Rs 40,000 crore, so there was huge shortfall."
